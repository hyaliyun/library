His family name was originally spelled Hollanda, but was changed to Holanda, presumably to follow the Portuguese spelling reform of 1943. Biography Aur√©lio was born in Passo de Camaragibe, Alagoas state, Brazil. In 1923 he moved to the state capital Macei√≥, where, at only 14 years of age, he gave private lessons of Portuguese language. One year later he became a first-grade teacher at the local high school Gin√°sio Primeiro de Mar√ßo. In 1936 obtained a law degree at the Recife Law School in Pernambuco, and in that same year he started teaching French and Portuguese grammar, as well as Brazilian and Portuguese literature, at the Alagoas State High School in Macei√≥. In 1937‚Äì1938 he also served as director of the Macei√≥ City Public Library. In 1938 he moved to the city of Rio de Janeiro, where he taught Brazilian and Portuguese Literature at elite secondary schools including the public Pedro II High School and the private Anglo-American High School. It was in Rio that he has started his career as a writer, by publishing articles, tales and chronicles in the local press. Between 1939 and 1943, he was acting secretary of the magazine Revista do Brasil. Aur√©lio started his career as a lexicographer in 1941, as a collaborator of the Pequeno Dicion√°rio da L√≠ngua Portuguesa. In 1942 he published a book of short stories, Dois Mundos (\\"Two Worlds\\"), which earned him a prize by the prestigious Brazilian Literary Academy. In 1943 he collaborated with the Dicion√°rio Enciclop√©dico sponsored by the Brazilian Book Institute. In 1945 he took part in the First Brazilian Writers Conference in S√£o Paulo. Between 1944 and 1949 he was a member of the Brazilian Writers Association (Rio de Janeiro branch). In 1945 he married Marina Baird, with whom he would have two children ‚Äì Aur√©lio and Maria Lu√≠sa ‚Äì and five grandchildren. Between 1947 and 1960, Aur√©lio authored various texts for the Conto da Semana (\\"Weekly Tale\\") section of the newspaper Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. Starting in 1950 he also authored the column Enrique√ßa o Seu Vocabul√°rio (\\"Enrich Your Vocabulary\\") for the Brazilian edition of Reader's Digest; these columns were later published as a book. Between 1954 and 1955 he lectured Brazilian studies at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, on a grant by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. He was elected a member of the Brazilian Literary Academy on May 4, 1961, and inaugurated on December 18, 1961, taking over seat number 30, formerly of Ant√¥nio Austreg√©silo. Inspired by his love of the Portuguese language, he decided to produce his own dictionary. After several years of work, in 1975 he published the Novo Dicion√°rio da L√≠ngua Portuguesa which would be for many decades the reference lexicon in Brazil ‚Äì to the point that Aur√©lio and Aureli√£o (\\"big Aur√©lio\\") became popular synonyms of dictionary. (It is said that his collaborators once proposed to add that entry to the dictionary, but Aur√©lio vetoed it.) This book went through dozens of reprints and revisions, and spawned several derivative editions. Aur√©lio was also member of the Brazilian Academy of Philology, of the Pen Clube do Brasil (the Brazilian section of the International Writers Association), the Brazilian Folklore Commission, the Alagoas Literary Academy, the Alagoas Historical and Geographical Institute, and the Hispanic Society of America.

The Tarawera Falls on the river are considered to be quite spectacular. Environmental issues The Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill, now owned by Norske Skog, has been discharging waste into the river since 1955. Local residents have erected signposts labelling the river as the \\"Black Drain\\" since the 1990s. The dark colour is due to the presence of pollution from farms, sewage and stormwater but it is predominantly from pulp and paper mill effluent. As of 1997, pulp and paper mills were discharging over 160 million litres of industrial waste into the river per day. By 2006, the oxygen levels in the river had reached a level where fish could survive, however the water colour was still dark. Since 1998 the colour and light penetration (euphotic depth) have improved in the lower section of the river due to less pollution from the Tasman Mill. In 2009, the mill gained permission to continue polluting the river for the next 25 years. In 2010, local iwi took a case to the High Court to shorten the 25 year water discharge permits issued under the Resource Management Act but the appeal was rejected.

The program was produced by Richard Lowenstein, Selin Yaman and Ghost Pictures and directed by Craig Melville, Richard Lowenstein and a number of other directors under the production company Ghost of Your Ex-Boyfriend Productions in association with SBS Independent. It screened in 2002, and consisted of sketches and outlandish public stunts, typical of Safran's work. The series won two Australian Film Institute Awards; \\"Best Comedy Series\\" and \\"Most Innovative Program Concept\\". SBS followed the series up with the similarly styled John Safran vs God in 2004. An infamous stunt of the series was sneaking nine friends into an exclusive Melbourne nightclub by dressing them up as the masked American metal band, Slipknot. The producers arranged entry for the impostors by pretending to be an American management company over the phone. Other stunts included disguising himself as well known entertainers such as Ozzy Osbourne and Prince to harass the public, sketch versions of music videos such as Eminem, the creation of Jew Town, a Jewish boy band to compete with Christian pop, and returning to Yeshivah College to pay homage to Kevin Bacon in Footloose. He also details his time in the hip- hop group Raspberry Cordial, and the related incident in which he met the Beastie Boys and the band's former DJ attempted to steal his girlfriend at the time. A regular segment on the series was \\"The Music Mole\\". In this segment a person dressed in a large mole costume (much like a mascot) was interviewed by Safran. The person was reported to be an insider (i.e. a mole) in the music industry who would reveal little known, often controversial facts about both the Australian and international music industries.

Asin appointed his maternal uncle Jin Mu as chief general and ordered him to attack Goguryeo repeatedly in the early 390s, but each attack was defeated. In 395, after a failed attack by Baekje, Goguryeo took Baekje's territory around today's northern Seoul. Asin sought to strengthen Baekje‚Äôs position against Goguryeo, sending his son Jeonji to the Wa kingdom of Japan as a ward to cement Baekje‚Äôs alliance with that country in 397.

To narrow can mean either to cause the directions of motion to become more aligned in a specific direction (i.e., make collimated light or parallel rays), or to cause the spatial cross section of the beam to become smaller (beam limiting device). History An English physicist Henry Kater was the inventor of the floating collimator, which rendered a great service to practical astronomy. He reported about his invention in January 1825.The Description of a Floating Collimator. By Captain Henry Kater. Read January 13, 1825. [Phil. Trans. 1825, p. 147.] In his report, Kater mentioned previous work in this area by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Friedrich Bessel. Optical collimators An example of an optical collimator with a bulb, an aperture (B), and a positive lens (L) In optics, a collimator may consist of a curved mirror or lens with some type of light source and/or an image at its focus. This can be used to replicate a target focused at infinity with little or no parallax. In lighting, collimators are typically designed using the principles of nonimaging optics. Optical collimators can be used to calibrate other optical devices,\\"Collimators and Auto Collimators\\" by Ron Dexter to check if all elements are aligned on the optical axis, to set elements at proper focus, or to align two or more devices such as binoculars or gun barrels and gunsights. A surveying camera may be collimated by setting its fiduciary markers so that they define the principal point, as in photogrammetry. Optical collimators are also used as gun sights in the collimator sight, which is a simple optical collimator with a cross hair or some other reticle at its focus. The viewer only sees an image of the reticle. They have to use it either with both eyes open and one eye looking into the collimator sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and the target, or with one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time. Elementary optics and applications to fire control instruments: May, 1921 By United States. Army. Ordnance Dept, page 84 Adding a beam splitter allows the viewer to see the reticle and the field of view, making a reflector sight. Collimators may be used with laser diodes and CO2 cutting lasers. Proper collimation of a laser source with long enough coherence length can be verified with a shearing interferometer. X-ray, gamma ray, and neutron collimators Collimators used to record gamma rays and neutrons from a nuclear test. In X-ray optics, gamma ray optics, and neutron optics, a collimator is a device that filters a stream of rays so that only those traveling parallel to a specified direction are allowed through. Collimators are used for X-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron imaging because it is difficult to focus these types of radiation into an image using lenses, as is routine with electromagnetic radiation at optical or near-optical wavelengths. Collimators are also used in radiation detectors in nuclear power stations to make directional sensitivity. =Applications= How a S√∂ller collimator filters a stream of rays. Top: without a collimator. Bottom: with a collimator. The figure to the right illustrates how a S√∂ller collimator is used in neutron and X-ray machines. The upper panel shows a situation where a collimator is not used, while the lower panel introduces a collimator. In both panels the source of radiation is to the right, and the image is recorded on the gray plate at the left of the panels. Without a collimator, rays from all directions will be recorded; for example, a ray that has passed through the top of the specimen (to the right of the diagram) but happens to be travelling in a downwards direction may be recorded at the bottom of the plate. The resultant image will be so blurred and indistinct as to be useless. In the lower panel of the figure, a collimator has been added (blue bars). This may be a sheet of lead or other material opaque to the incoming radiation with many tiny holes bored through it or in the case of neutrons it can be a sandwich arrangement (which can be up to several feet long - see ENGIN-X) with many layers alternating between neutron absorbing material (e.g. gadolinium) with neutron transmitting material. This can be something simple e.g. air. or if mechanical strength is needed then aluminium may be used. If this forms part of a rotating assembly, the sandwich may be curved. This allows energy selection in addition to collimation - the curvature of the collimator and its rotation will present a straight path only to one energy of neutrons. Only rays that are travelling nearly parallel to the holes will pass through them‚Äîany others will be absorbed by hitting the plate surface or the side of a hole. This ensures that rays are recorded in their proper place on the plate, producing a clear image. For industrial radiography using gamma radiation sources such as iridium-192 or cobalt-60, a collimator (beam limiting device) allows the radiographer to control the exposure of radiation to expose a film and create a radiograph, to inspect materials for defects. A collimator in this instance is most commonly made of tungsten, and is rated according to how many half value layers it contains, i.e., how many times it reduces undesirable radiation by half. For instance, the thinnest walls on the sides of a 4 HVL tungsten collimator thick will reduce the intensity of radiation passing through them by 88.5%. The shape of these collimators allows emitted radiation to travel freely toward the specimen and the x-ray film, while blocking most of the radiation that is emitted in undesirable directions such as toward workers. =Limitations= Collimator for a neutron stream, University of Washington cyclotron Although collimators improve resolution, they also reduce intensity by blocking incoming radiation, which is undesirable for remote sensing instruments that require high sensitivity. For this reason, the gamma ray spectrometer on the Mars Odyssey is a non-collimated instrument. Most lead collimators let less than 1% of incident photons through. Attempts have been made to replace collimators with electronic analysis. =In radiation therapy= Collimators (beam limiting devices) are used in linear accelerators used for radiotherapy treatments. They help to shape the beam of radiation emerging from the machine and can limit the maximum field size of a beam. The treatment head of a linear accelerator consists of both a primary and secondary collimator. The primary collimator is positioned after the electron beam has reached a vertical orientation. When using photons, it is placed after the beam has passed through the X-ray target. The secondary collimator is positioned after either a flattening filter (for photon therapy) or a scattering foil (for electron therapy). The secondary collimator consists of two jaws which can be moved to either enlarge or minimize the size of the treatment field. New systems involving multileaf collimators (MLCs) are used to further shape a beam to localise treatment fields in radiotherapy. MLCs consist of approximately 50‚Äì120 leaves of heavy, metal collimator plates which slide into place to form the desired field shape.

It had a Japanese subsidiary named . History By 1984, Atari, Inc. had been split into two distinct companies. Atari Corporation was responsible for computer and console games and hardware and owned the rights to the Atari brand for these domains. Atari Games was formed from Atari, Inc's arcade division, and were able to use the Atari name on arcade releases but not on console or computer games. When Atari Games wanted to enter the console game market, it needed to create a new label that did not use the Atari name. The new subsidiary was dubbed Tengen, which in the Japanese nomenclature of the board game Go refers to the central point of the board (the word \\"Atari\\" comes from the same game). Atari Games tried to negotiate with Nintendo for a less restrictive license to produce games for the Nintendo Entertainment System; at the time, Nintendo restricted their licensees to releasing only five games per year, mandated that Nintendo handle cartridge manufacturing, and required their games to be NES-exclusive for two years.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/25/happy_30th_anniversary_tengen_you_fought_the_video_game_law_and_the_law_won/ Nintendo refused, so in December 1987, Atari Games agreed to Nintendo's standard licensing terms. Tengen was incorporated on December 21 of that year. In 1988, Tengen released its first and only three games licensed by Nintendo: R.B.I. Baseball, Pac-Man, and Gauntlet. Meanwhile, Tengen secretly worked to bypass Nintendo's lock-out chip called 10NES that gave it control over which games were published for the NES. They started development on a chip they called Rabbit. While numerous manufacturers managed to override this chip by zapping it with a voltage spike, Tengen engineers feared this could potentially damage NES consoles and expose them to unnecessary liability.http://articles.pubarticles.com/how-to-the-history-from-the- nintendo-nes-seal-of-quality-1427256345,1514584.html The other problem was that Nintendo made frequent modifications to the NES to prevent this technique from working. Instead the company chose to reverse engineer the chip and decipher the code required to unlock it. However, the engineers were unable to do so, and the launch date for its first batch of games was rapidly approaching. With time running short, Tengen turned to the United States Copyright Office. Its lawyers contacted the government office to request a copy of the Nintendo lock-out program, claiming that the company needed it for potential litigation against Nintendo. Once obtained, it used the program to create its own chip that would unlock the NES.https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9amg87/how-third-party-game- devs-reverse-engineered-their-way-onto-your-consoles-nintendo-sega-atari Tengen announced that they were going to release their own cartridges in December 1988. When Tengen launched the unlicensed versions of its games, Nintendo immediately sued Tengen for copyright and patent infringement. This began a series of lawsuits between the companies which would not be settled until 1994. Tengen faced another court challenge with Nintendo in 1989 in copyright controversy over the two companies' NES versions of Tetris. Tengen lost this suit as well, and was forced to recall what was estimated to be hundreds of thousands of unsold cartridges of its version of Tetris (having sold only about 50,000 copies). Tengen went on to produce games for the Sega Genesis, Master System, Game Gear, and TurboGrafx-16, as well as publish a localized Sega CD title. The company also licensed games for home computers such as the Amiga and the Atari ST, most of which were published by British company Domark. It was best known for its ports of popular Atari arcade games, including Klax, Hard Drivin', STUN Runner, and Paperboy, although they published many other titles as well. In 1994, with the lawsuit against Nintendo settled and after Time Warner reacquired a controlling stake in Atari Games, Tengen was consolidated into Time Warner Interactive. NES games Tengen manufactured both licensed and unlicensed versions of three of their NES games (R.B.I. Baseball, Gauntlet, and Pac-Man). The cartridges for their unlicensed games did not come in the gray, semi-square shape that licensed NES games came in; instead, they are rounded and matte-black, and resemble the original Atari cartridges. ;Licensed and unlicensed * R.B.I.

(18 July 1795 ‚Äì 28 January 1879) was a well-connected and controversial Irish-born Calvinist Anglican of Scottish descent.M‚ÄòNeile was descended from Scots who came to Ireland in 1610, with Randal MacDonnell (?‚Äì1636), First Earl of Antrim, to settle in King James I's Plantation of Ulster (Dublin University Magazine, 1847, p. 462). Fiercely anti-Tractarian and anti-Roman Catholic (and, even more so, anti-Anglo-Catholic) and an Evangelical and millenarian cleric,In 1838, Mourant Brock (1802‚Äì1856) had estimated that there were at least seven hundred of the English clergy were pre-milenialists (Advent Tracts, Vol. II, (1844), p.135); and, in 1855, \\"a commentator in the British and Foreign Evangelical Review ‚Ä¶ estimated that more than half of the evangelicals in the church favored millenarian views\\" (Sandeen, E.R., The Roots of Fundamentalism: British and American Millenarianism, 1800‚Äì1930, University of Chicago Press, p.40) who was also a devoted advocate of the year-for-a-day principle, M‚ÄòNeile was the perpetual curate of St Jude's Liverpool (1834‚Äì1848), the perpetual curate of St Paul's Princes Park (1848‚Äì1867), an honorary canon of Chester Cathedral (1845‚Äì1868) and the Dean of Ripon (1868‚Äì1875). He was a member of the Protestant Association (in its 19th-century incarnation),The Protestant Association had been inactive since the time of the \\"No Popery\\" Gordon Riots of 1780. This unrest, fomented by Lord George Gordon (1751‚Äì1793), was directed against the Irish in general, Roman Catholics in particular, the Government in general and, most particularly the Lord Chief Justice William Murray (1705‚Äì1793). The riots were in reaction to the passing of the first \\"Catholic Relief Act\\", the Papists Act (1788), that had attenuated some of the restrictions of the Popery Act (1698). The riots involved up to 60,000 people and resulted in widespread looting, significant destruction of churches and other property, including the private residence of the Lord Chief Justice, and many deaths. Ironically, Gordon later converted to Judaism (in 1787), adopting the name Israel Abraham George Gordon and remained a devout Jew for the remainder of his life.Inactive since Lord George Gordon‚Äôs \\"No Popery\\" riots in London in 1780, the Protestant Association re-emerged as an active force in 1835. M‚ÄôNeile, one of its most active clerical participants, founded its Liverpool branch in 1837 or 1838 (Paz, 1992, p. 200). the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews,The Society, founded in 1809, emerged from a committee formed by the London Missionary Society two years earlier, in 1807, to work exclusively amongst London‚Äôs Jews. M‚ÄòNeile delivered the society‚Äôs annual sermon in both 1826 and 1846, as well as publishing a number of lectures and sermons related to Jews and Jewish matters: e.g., his Popular Lectures on the Prophecies Relative to the Jewish Nation (1830), revised and reissued as Prospects of the Jews; or, Popular Lectures on the Prophecies Relative to the Jewish Nation (1840). A letter written to his future wife (on 28 September 1841), by William Ballantyne Hodgson (1815‚Äì1880), describes M‚ÄòNeile‚Äôs position: :\\"Bigotry, encouraged by the want of opposition, speaks out more and more boldly [here in Liverpool]. \\"Every Jew, dying as a Jew, is irretrievably lost\\", said the Rev. Hugh McNeile the other day; \\"it is godlike love to tell them of their miserable condition; godless liberalism to conceal it from them\\". The tyranny of the priesthood is said to be great in Scotland, but really I think it is much worse here.\\" (Meiklejohn, 1883, p.36). the Irish Society,The Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language. According to an advertisement placed by the Society in the end papers of Crockford (1868), the Society was established in 1818 and, in 1868, M‚ÄòNeile was one of its Vice Presidents. the Church Missionary Society, and the Church Association.Scotland (1997): \\"The Church Association ‚Ä¶ formed in 1865 ‚Ä¶ had as one of its avowed aims to fight ritualism in the courts by means of legal action. Many, such as Lord Shaftesbury, who had tried to introduce various bills into Parliament to curb ritualism were growing frustrated at their inability to do anything. The Church Association had a number of influential members including the Rev Dr William Wilson (Vicar of Holy Rood, Southampton), brother-in-law to the Bishop of Winchester. Canon Champneys, who was made Dean of Lichfield ‚Ä¶ [and M‚ÄòNeile]. \\"The purpose of the Association was \\"to uphold the doctrines, principles, and order of the United Church of England and Ireland, and to counteract the efforts now being made to pervert her teaching on essential points of Christian faith, or to assimilate the services to those of the Church of Rome, and to further encourage concerted action for the advancement and progress of spiritual religion\\". \\"The Church Association [sought] to effect these objects by publicity through lectures, meetings, and the use of the Press, by Appeals to the Courts of Law...‚Äô in an effort to secure episcopal and other authoritative suppression of ceremonies, vestments and ornaments which had departed from the Church at the time of the Reformation.\\" M‚ÄòNeile was an influential, well-connected demagogue, a renowned public speaker, an evangelical cleric and a relentless opponent of ‚ÄúPopery‚Äù,\\"It is our intention to call the religion of the Church of Rome by the name of Popery, or Romanism, and not of Catholicism, and to designate the subjects of the Pope as Papists, or Romanists, and not as Catholics. As we reckon this a topic of some importance, and as it is one on which Papists are much in the habit of complaining and declaiming, we think it proper to explain, once for all, the grounds of the course we mean to pursue in this matter. The adherents of the Church of Rome always call themselves Catholics, and refuse this designation to all other professing Christians, while they resent it as an insult and an injury when they are styled Papists or Romanists. The grounds of the course we mean to follow in this matter of names may be embodied in these two positions:‚Äî1st, The adherents of the Church of Rome have no right to the designation of Catholics, they insult and injure Protestants by assuming it, and therefore it ought never to be conceded to them; and, 2d, Protestants do not insult and injure the adherents of the Church of Rome by calling them Papists or Romanists, but, on the contrary, employ, in doing so, a perfectly just, fair, and accurate designation‚Ä¶\\" (p. 22, \\"On the Use of the Names \\"Popery\\", and \\"Romanism\\", and \\"Papist\\" and \\"Romanist\\"\\", The Bulwark or, Reformation Journal: In Defence of the True Interests of Man and of Society, Especially in Reference to the Religious, Social and Political Bearings of Popery, Vol. 1, No. 2 (August 1851), pp. 22‚Äì25. who was permanently inflamed by the ever-increasing number of Irish Roman Catholics in Liverpool.In a private letter to Queen Victoria in 1869, advocating M‚ÄòNeile‚Äôs elevation to Dean of Ripon, Benjamin Disraeli, mentioned that \\"[M‚ÄòNeile] is a great orator, and one of those whose words, at periods of national excitement, influence opinion\\". The response, written on the Queen‚Äôs behalf, by Major General Sir Thomas Myddleton Biddulph, the joint Keeper of the Privy Purse, spoke directly of the Queen‚Äôs reluctance: \\"However great Dr. McNeile's attainments may be, and however distinguished he may be as speaker, the Queen believes he has chiefly rendered himself conspicuous by his hostility to the Roman Catholic Church. The Queen would ask whether his appointment is not likely to stir up a considerable amount of ill-feeling among the Roman Catholics, and in the minds of those who sympathise with them ‚Ä¶\\" (Buckle (1926a), pp.533‚Äì534).

He was just as deeply loved, admired and respected by some,\\"Unquestionably the greatest Evangelical preacher and speaker in the Church of England during this century\\" (Stock, 1899, p.376); \\"universally known‚Ä¶ as one of the most powerful instruments ever raised up to arm the church in troublous days‚Ä¶ No man living has been so grossly, so impudently, calumniated in the face of all evidence; no man is so notoriously dreaded by the workers of seditious evil in church and state; and perhaps no man on earth is so ardently, so extensively loved by all classes of right-minded people.\\" (\\"Charlotte Elizabeth\\", (1840), p.143.) as he was an object of derision and scorn for others.\\"A bold bad Irishman\\"; \\"this politico-religious firebrand\\"; \\"the factitious bigotry [evoked by] this dangerous man\\" (Thomas Earnshaw Bradley (1820‚Äì1866) in Bradley, 1852, p.393). \\"Probably the most eloquent, the most able and the most consistent religious agitator of his day\\" (James Murphy, 1959, p.51). \\"A bigoted divine, who enjoys unfortunately a very extensive popularity\\" (William North (1825‚Äì1854), 1845, I, p.174.).

M‚ÄòNeile's father owned considerable property (including the large farm at Collier's Hall), was a Justice of the Peace and served as the High Sheriff of the County of Antrim.In the latter part of the 1870s the Revd Hugh M‚ÄòNeile of Ripon was registered as owning 699 acres in County Antrim, Ireland. His brother, John M‚ÄòNeile (1788‚Äì1855), having made his fortune in South America, returned to Ireland and was one of the founding members of the Northern Bank, the first bank in Belfast. John M‚ÄòNeile married Charlotte Lavinia Dallas (1803‚Äì1859) on 11 June 1823 and had two sons, Henry Hugh (1829‚Äì?) and Alexander John (1842‚Äì?) and one daughter, Mary Harriet (1833‚Äì1919), who married Hugh McCalmont Cairns (1810‚Äì1885), the First Earl Cairns, who served as Attorney General in the third Derby‚ÄìDisraeli ministry (10 July 1866 ‚Äì 29 October 1866), as Lord Chancellor in the first and second Disraeli ministries,He served from February to December 1868 and February 1874 to April 1880 respectively. It was during this time that he exerted sufficient pressure on the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli (1804‚Äì1881), to have his uncle-by- marriage, Hugh M‚ÄòNeile, appointed as Dean of Ripon and his nephew, William Connor Magee (1821‚Äì1891), appointed as to Bishop of Peterborough. and as (opposition) Conservative Leader in the House of Lords (1869‚Äì1870). M‚ÄòNeile was tall, extremely strong, intelligent, a good horseman and considered by most to be extremely handsome.An American travel writer, David W. Bartlett (1828‚Äì1912), described M‚ÄòNeile, then in his 50s, as follows: \\"In the pulpit he looks more like a son of Vulcan than a minister of the Prince of Peace, and one is reminded while looking at him of the celebrated Methodist Minister, Peter Cartwright, of Illinois, who often left his pulpit to silence disturbances with his brawny fists. When [M‚ÄòNeile] rises to speak, you are awed by his powerful physical appearance; he is tall and stout, with broad shoulders and muscular arms, while his great, sloping forehead, white as snow, contrasts finely with his dark hair. His eyes are expressive of genius, while his whole face has the look of a man whom all the powers of Europe could not drive from a position he had taken conscientiously.\\" (Bartlett (1853, pp.275‚Äì276). (Peter Cartwright (1785‚Äì1872), was a tough, menacing, travelling Methodist Episcopal Church Minister, \\"The Backwoods Preacher\\", renowned for his physical strength and aggression, who operated over vast frontier areas in Kentucky and Tennessee, before moving to Illinois in 1824.) In 1822 M‚ÄòNeile married Anne Magee (1803‚Äì1881), the fourth daughter of William Magee (1766‚Äì1831), the Archbishop of Dublin.William Magee, who was strongly anti- Catholic, was Assistant Professor of Oriental Tongues (1800‚Äì1806) and Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin (1806‚Äì1812), the Church of Ireland‚Äôs Dean of Cork (1813‚Äì1819), Bishop of Raphoe (1819‚Äì1822) and Archbishop of Dublin (1822‚Äì1831). His grandson (also M‚ÄòNeile‚Äôs nephew), William Connor Magee (1821‚Äì1891), was appointed Bishop of Peterborough by Disraeli in 1868; he served until 1891 when he was appointed as Archbishop of York, dying four months later. They had sixteen children (four of whom died early in life): three daughters, two of whom remained unmarried, and thirteen sons.McDonnell (2005). As a testament to his influence, a number of his children went on to have distinguished careers, including: *Alexander M‚ÄòNeile (1823‚Äì1912) *Colonel William M‚ÄòNeile (1824‚Äì1870), Commissioner of Punjab. *Elizabeth M‚ÄòNeile (1827‚Äì1910) *Hugh M‚ÄòNeile (1828‚Äì1842), who was killed, aged 14, in an accident with a loaded pistol. *Mary M‚ÄòNeile (1831‚Äì ?) *Daniel James M‚ÄòNeile (1835‚Äì1874), of the Bengal Civil Service.He married Julia Savage in 1869. They had three children. Whilst on twelve months' home leave with his family, staying with his father at Ripon, he went fishing in the river Ure on the morning of 31 August 1874 near West Tanfield. Whilst he was in the river fishing the level of the river suddenly rose some four feet and he was swept away. Despite extensive searches along the river, his body was not found until twelve days later, floating face up in the river near Boroughbridge. *John Magee M‚ÄòNeile (1837‚Äì1898) *Anne M‚ÄòNeile (1838‚Äì?) *The Revd Edmund Hugh M‚ÄòNeile (1840‚Äì1893), an honorary canon of Liverpool (1880‚Äì1893), also served at St Paul's, Prince's Park, Liverpool (1867‚Äì1893) and as chaplain to the Bishop of Chester (1877‚Äì1884). He married Cecilia Elizabeth (1841‚Äì1929), daughter of Sir Thomas Francis Fremantle, Lord Cottesloe (1798‚Äì1890). *Charles M‚ÄòNeile (1841‚Äì1925) *The Revd Hector M‚ÄòNeile (1843‚Äì1922), a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge (1865‚Äì1871), the vicar of Bredbury, Cheshire (1893‚Äì1900), a missionary of the Church Missionary Society in Bombay (1900‚Äì1907) and vicar of Bishop's Sutton, Hampshire (1907‚Äì1922). He married Mary Rosa Lush. One of his three sons, the Revd Robert Fergus M‚ÄòNeile, and two of his daughters, Annie Hilda M‚ÄòNeile and Jessie Margaret M‚ÄòNeile, served as missionaries in Egypt and Palestine. His third daughter, Ethel Rhoda M‚ÄòNeile (1875‚Äì1922), served as a missionary in India. *Captain Malcolm M‚ÄòNeile (1845‚Äì1923), R.N., Governor, Royal Naval Prison at Lewes.He married Christiana Mary Sloggett on 28 July 1870 in the Cathedral at Ripon, with his father officiating, and his brother Ernest assisting. Father of Lieutenant Malcolm Douglas McNeile, R.N. (1880‚Äì?), Minnie Mabel Barkworth, M.B.E. (1871‚Äì1898), and Lieutenant-Colonel Herman Cyril McNeile (1888‚Äì1937) who, with the pen-name \\"Sapper\\", was possibly the most popular English author in the 1930s. *Norman Frederick M‚ÄòNeile (1846‚Äì1929), Known as \\"the blind vicar\\", he was born on 14 August 1846 and served at St Peter's Brafferton Parish Church in Helperby, Yorkshire for 50 years. Married to Clara Cecilia Willink (1852‚Äì1929) in July 1881. He was completely blind from the age of 12.He had been taught by the Revd Robert Hugh Blair, Rector of St Michael‚Äôs, Worcester, first at a Liverpool school and later at The King‚Äôs School, Worcester. It was Blair who founded the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen in 1866 (the first such public school in England, as distinct from earlier vocational and industrial training establishments), under the auspices of the Bishop of Worcester, where M‚ÄòNeile would go for assistance with his studies at Trinity College, Dublin and for additional coaching and preparation on each of his vacations between 1867 and 1871 (Bell, 1967, p.16). He received his B.A. in 1868, and M.A. in 1871. He had been trained to read the services from a special prayer book, created for him by Blair, that had raised print on each page (\\"Personal\\", Oswego Daily Palladium, 15 June 1876). Education M‚ÄòNeile in 1840 M‚ÄòNeile received a private education. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1810, and graduated Artium Baccalaureus (AB), with a good degree in classics in 1815. He also began legal studies at The King's Inns in Dublin and, having served all his terms there, transferred to London's Lincoln's Inn in 1814. He almost completed his terms there as well when, around 1819, he decided to abandon the law as well as the political career that his family had anticipated for him and return to his studies in order to qualify for ordination. He graduated Magister Artium, at Dublin University in 1822. In 1847, M‚ÄòNeilee graduated Bachelor of Divinity (BD) and Doctor of Divinity (DD) from Dublin University.\\"Domestic Intelligence: Ireland\\", The Aberdeen Journal, and General Advertiser for the North of Scotland, No.5182, (5 May 1847), p.7, col.B. In essence, the BD degree was a coursework and postgraduate degree only available to those who had graduated MA at least 10 years earlier; the DD was conventionally awarded simultaneously on the basis of published work. In M‚ÄòNeile's case the published work would have been The Church and the Churches (1846).Crockford (1868, p. 432) mistakenly asserts that M‚ÄòNeile‚Äôs two divinity degrees were awarded to him \\"honoris causa\\". They were not honoris causa and they were not \\"token\\" degrees. They were awarded simultaneously on the basis of coursework (BD) and published work (DD). They were, essentially, Trinity College‚Äôs equivalent of the Oxford University‚Äôs current Bachelor and Doctor in Divinity by Accumulation. On 16 June 1860, an Incorporate DD ‚Äì i.e., a doctorate ad eundem gradum (\\"to the same degree\\"), admitting M‚ÄòNeile as a member of Cambridge University by virtue of his possession of a DD from another university (Trinity College, Dublin) ‚Äì was conferred upon him at Cambridge University.\\"University Intelligence\\", Morning Chronicle, 18 June 1860. Early adulthood Whilst a student, and preparing for a career in the law, M‚ÄòNeile loved the theatre even more than the fashionable society in which he moved.Much of this section is based upon the article \\"The Rev. Hugh M‚ÄòNeile, A.M.\\" in Dublin University Magazine of April 1847. He attended the theatre in Dublin, London and Bath as often as he could. In those days, Sarah Siddons, her brother John, and Eliza O'Neill (later Lady Wrixon-Becher) ‚Äì all favourites of M‚ÄòNeile ‚Äì were at their peak; and his later platform and pulpit performances drew very heavily on their example.\\"‚Ä¶ [and] it might also be considered whether much of that grace and elegance of enunciation and manner for which he has always been remarkable, may not be owing to impressions unconsciously stamped upon a plastic mind, by the contemplation of those brilliant models‚Ä¶\\" p.463. When M‚ÄòNeile was 20, his father's unmarried brother, Lieutenant-General Daniel M‚ÄôNeile (1754‚Äì1826), returned to Ireland following distinguished service with the East India Company. His uncle, who settled in Bath, delighted in M‚ÄôNeile's company, and his uncle virtually adopted him; and, it seemed, he was the heir presumptive to his uncle's considerable fortune.McNeile (1911), p.265. His uncle, whose wealth and influence would have easily have procured M‚ÄòNeile a seat in parliament, and who understood that success at the bar would be a stepping-stone for the talented lad into a productive political career, encouraged him to pursue a legal career. He took his A.B. in 1815, and continued his legal studies. Most of his time between 1815 and 1819 was spent with his uncle in Bath. In 1816 he and his uncle travelled extensively on the continent, enjoying the social advantages of his uncle's influence.There is no doubt, so soon after the victory of the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), the Restoration of Louis XVIII (28 June 1815), and the permanent exiling of Napoleon Bonaparte to the island of St. Helena (16 October 1815), \\"[that] on the continent‚Ä¶ the name of an English general was sure to meet with‚Ä¶ more than an ordinary degree of respect and attention\\" (Dublin University Magazine, 1847, p.464). In the process, M‚ÄôNeile spent time with mixing with influential people, such as Madame de Sta√´l (1766‚Äì1817) and Lord Byron (1788‚Äì1824). In the middle of 1816, whilst staying with his uncle in a Swiss village inn, M‚ÄôNeile fell very seriously ill. His life was saved by the medical intervention of Henry Brougham (1778‚Äì1868), a stranger to M‚ÄôNeile at the time, who had called at the inn for refreshment (or a change of horses). Upon his return to England, a changed M‚ÄôNeile began reading the Bible daily and, around 1819, he experienced a conversion to Christianity within the Evangelical Anglican tradition. To his uncle's dismay, he hinted that he might give away law and politics and dedicate his life to the church. According to most accounts, when he finally announced that he was embracing church ministry as a profession, his greatly disappointed uncle \\"disinherited\\" him.For example, see McNeile (1911), p.265. Clerical career Following his theological studies, M‚ÄòNeile was ordained in 1820 by his future father-in-law, William Magee (1766‚Äì1831) ‚Äì who, at that time, was the Church of Ireland's Bishop of Raphoe ‚Äì and served as a curate in Stranorlar, County Donegal from 1820 to 1821. Early in 1822, his preaching in London so impressed the banker and parliamentarian Henry Drummond (1786‚Äì1860) that Drummond appointed M‚ÄòNeile to the living of the parish of Albury, Surrey, from where M‚ÄòNeile's first collection of sermons, Seventeen Sermons, etc., were published in 1825. From 1826 to 1830, Drummond hosted the annual Albury Conferences,Albury parish website: Brief History of Albury. held in Albury for the Union of the Students of Prophecy moderated by M‚ÄòNeile.According to Flegg (1992, pp.3 7‚Äì38), apart from M‚ÄòNeile, the participants included the clerics Henry Forster Burder (1783‚Äì1864), William Hodgson Cole (1806‚Äì1852), William Dodsworth (1798‚Äì1861), William Dow (1800‚Äì1855), Edward Irving (1792‚Äì1834), William Marsh (1775‚Äì1864), Henry John Owen (1795‚Äì1862), John Simons (1754‚Äì1836), John Haldane Stewart (1766‚Äì1854), Robert Story (1790‚Äì1859), Edward Thomas Vaughan (1777‚Äì1829), Daniel Wilson (1778‚Äì1858) and Joseph Wolff (1795‚Äì1862); and the laymen, John Bayford (1774‚Äì1844), Thomas William Chevalier (1799‚Äì1835), Henry Drummond (1786‚Äì1860), John Hookham Frere (1769‚Äì1846), James Gambier (1756‚Äì1833), Charles Robert Malden (1797‚Äì1855), Viscount Mandeville (1799‚Äì1855), Spencer Perceval (1795‚Äì1859), John James Strutt (1796‚Äì1873) and John Owen Tudor (1783‚Äì1861). Each of the Albury Conferences involved days full of close and laborious study of the prophetical books of the Bible; attempting to seek out as-yet-unfulfilled prophecies within them. As they progressed, \\"[their] prophetic speculations became more and more extreme\\".Carter (2001), p.179. It was at Albury that M‚ÄòNeile first met Edward Irving (1792‚Äì1834). Irving was a strong believer in the \\"gifts\\" of \\"speaking in tongues\\" (glossolalia) and spiritual healing. It was through Irving that M‚ÄòNeile first encountered the Irish-born Okey Sisters. His experience of the deception of Okey Sisters' reputed speaking in tongues with Irving, and his knowledge of their later association with Elliotson and his mesmerism, and their well-attested fraudulent deception of Elliotson, must have strongly informed his later views of the activities of magnetists such as Lafontaine.For a detailed treatment of Jane and Elizabeth Okey, see pp.155‚Äì194 in Clarke, J. F., Autobiographical Recollections of the Medical Profession, J. & A. Churchill, (London), 1874. In relation to the reputed prophecy, glossolalia and healing, M‚ÄòNeile became increasingly torn between his own developing view that they were not of the Holy Spirit of and his desire to remain loyal to Drummond who thought that they were. In the early 1830s, whilst still within the \\"Prophetic Circle\\", M‚ÄòNeile had dabbled with spiritual healing and speaking with tongues himself. By July 1832, M‚ÄòNeile was preaching at Albury against the reputed spiritual gifts and was protesting about Drummond's private prayer meetings, because, equating Drummond's residence to a church, M‚ÄòNeile \\"would not suffer laymen to pray in his presence\\". Further, he most strongly objected \\"[that] it was not of God\\" when a female at one of Drummond's prayer sessions, which M‚ÄòNeile had \\"attended reluctantly\\", spoke in tongues ‚Äì and, thus, \\"contradicting the biblical injunction against women teaching in church\\". This caused such a rift that Drummond said \\"if [M‚ÄòNeile] persisted in preaching against the work of the Lord and against all who believed in it\\" he would be unable to remain within the Church of England.Carter (2001), p.186). Soon after, Drummond ceased attending services at Albury. Their relationship became so unworkable that M‚ÄòNeile resigned his post in June 1834. In October 1834, at the suggestion of a friend, the Revd William Dalton (1801‚Äì1880), he was appointed to St Jude's Church, Liverpool. The church, which had been built by subscription expressly for Dalton in 1831, could comfortably hold 1,500 people (it was demolished in 1966). At St Jude's, M‚ÄòNeile had \\"a handsome salary\\" and \\"a very large and opulent congregation\\".Grant (1841), p.239. Once installed at St Jude's, M‚ÄòNeile's eloquence attracted the attention of the Bishop of Chester ‚Äì John Sumner (1780‚Äì1862), later Archbishop of Canterbury ‚Äì who appointed him as an honorary canon of his cathedral. The next Bishop of Chester, John Graham (1794‚Äì1865), also held the important and influential ecclesiastical position of Clerk of the Closet to Queen Victoria. Graham was equally impressed with M‚ÄòNeile and possibly used his connections to facilitate the conferral of the Incorporate D.D. upon him in 1860. Later, at St Paul's, a 2,000 plus seat church specifically built for him and consecrated on 2 March 1848 by John Bird Sumner, then Archbishop of Canterbury elect (it closed in 1974) he enjoyed a large income. Over time, M‚ÄòNeile became a rich man and his financial independence meant that he answered to none: \\"McNeile was a fighter by instinct and a political parson by principle and, supported by a confidence derived from considerable personal wealth, he was his own man.\\"Neal (1998), p.45. His stipend at St Paul's was ¬£1,000 per annum, more than twelve times that of an average curate. He also received ¬£1,500 per annum in pew rents: \\"He had a large following, and his capacity to imbue popular prejudice against Roman Catholicism with the dignity of a spiritual crusade gave him enormous and explosive influence on Merseyside.\\"Wolff (2004).  Roman Catholicism and the Anglo-Catholics  In the simplest terms, the doctrines and the rituals peculiar to the Anglo-Catholics were considered, by Evangelicals such as M‚ÄòNeile,This view was also held by Queen Victoria; at whose urging the Public Worship Regulation Act (1874) was passed. (See below) to be a blatant violations of the promise that all of the Anglican clergy routinely made: viz., to adhere to the forms of service as specified in the Book of Common Prayer ‚Äì in particular, to what it demanded and what it disallowed ‚Äì and to adhere to the \\"Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion\\". For M‚ÄòNeile, Roman Catholicism endangered \\"Britain‚Äôs providential mission to defend and propagate reformed Christianity\\": this \\"providential mission\\" was a mission of \\"nationalism\\" ‚Äì a concept \\"contain[ing] an inherent conviction of objective national superiority\\" ‚Äì rather than one of \\"patriotism\\" (Wolffe, 1991, pp. 308‚Äì309).M‚ÄòNeile was one of the first to use the term \\"nationalism\\". He did so when he delivered a speech, \\"Nationalism in Religion\\", to the England Protestant Association at the Exeter Hall in London on 8 May 1839. The Roman Catholic Relief Act, enacted in 1829 principally to avert the threat of religious civil war in Ireland, abolished many of the restrictions on Roman Catholics that had operated in the United Kingdom for more than a century. This distressed many Anglicans such as M‚ÄòNeile, who were already fighting against the influence of Anglo-Catholics in the Church of England. ::\\"As the Tractarian movement in the Church of England developed, M‚ÄòNeile became one of its most zealous opponents and the most conspicuous leader of the evangelical party. In 1840, he published Lectures on the Church of England and in 1846 (the year after John Henry Newman's secession to Rome), The Church and the Churches, in which he maintained with much dialectical skill the evangelical doctrine of the \\"invisible Church\\" in opposition to the teaching of Newman and Pusey\\" (McNeile, 1911, p. 265). In April 1845, when speaking in the House of Commons on the Maynooth Endowment Bill, Thomas Macaulay characterized M‚ÄòNeile as \\"the most powerful representative of uncompromising Protestant opinion in the country\\" (McNeile, 1911, p. 265). Queen Victoria, clearly shared M‚ÄòNeile's view: ::The Queen feels, more strongly than words can express, the duty which is imposed upon her and her family, to maintain the true and real principles and spirit of the Protestant religion; for her family was brought over [from the Netherlands] and placed on the throne of these realms solely to maintain it; and the Queen will not stand the attempts [that are being] made to‚Ä¶ bring the Church of England as near the Church of Rome as they possibly can. Queen Victoria (Friday, 23 November 1866).From a letter written to Gerald Valerian Wellesley (1809‚Äì1882), Dean of Windsor, nephew of the Duke of Wellington, her resident chaplain, and one of Queen Victoria's most valued advisors, on 23 November 1866 (Buckle, 1926a, p. 877, emphasis in original). In late 1850, the Pope issued a bull, Universalis Ecclesi√¶, unilaterally (a) reviving the Roman Catholic hierarchy in England, (b) appointing twelve bishops and, also, (c) appointing the first English cardinal since the Reformation. This generated strong anti-Catholic sentiment among some English people.Altholz, J.L., The Political Behavior of the English Catholics, 1850‚Äì1867, Journal of British Studies, Vol.4, No.1, (November 1964), pp.89‚Äì103; Ralls, W., \\"The Papal Aggression of 1850: A Study in Victorian Anti-Catholicism\\", Church History, Vol.43, No.2, (June 1974), pp. 242‚Äì256; \\"Men are called upon to combine to prevent foreign interference with the prerogatives of the Queen, and to resist jurisdiction by the Pope in Her Majesty's dominions\\" (Disraeli: \\"Papal Aggression\\" (Letter to the Editor), The Times, 9 November 1850, p.4, col.F. There were widespread \\"No Popery\\" processions and anti-\\"Papal Aggression\\" meetings, many of which were addressed by M‚ÄòNeile, protesting against this perceived attack on British sovereignty.M‚ÄòNeile, H., The Rev. Dr. M'Neile's Speech on the Papal Aggression: Delivered at Exeter Hall, on Tuesday, 17 December 1850, C. Westerton, (London), 1850. In late 1873, Queen Victoria expressed alarm at the increase of the \\"Romanising tendencies\\" in the Church of England. She declared that, in the absence of \\"a complete Reformation\\" (her preferred solution), the only remedy seemed to be for the British Parliament to give the Archbishop of Canterbury \\"the power‚Ä¶ to stop all these Ritualistic practices, dressings, bowings, etc. and every thing of that kind and, above all, all attempts at confession\\". Further, she lamented \\"the terrible amount of bigotry, and self- sufficiency and contempt of all other Protestant Churches‚Ä¶ [shown by the Church of England, and felt] the English Church should stretch out its arms to other Protestant Churches ‚Ä¶ and bethink itself of its dangers from Papacy, instead of trying to widen the breach with all other Protestant churches, and to magnify small differences of form\\".From a letter written to Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815‚Äì1881), Dean of Westminster, on 13 November 1873 (Buckle, 1926b, pp. 290‚Äì291, with the emphases in original). The growing ritualism of the Anglo-Catholics and the rise of the Oxford Movement had become so intolerable to Queen VictoriaIn the same letter to Stanley (p.291), Queen Victoria urged that the Bishops, in the House of Lords, \\"ask for power to put a stop to all these new and very dangerous as well as absurd practices‚Ä¶\\" (emphasis in original). that, at her urging, and on her behalf, the Archbishop of Canterbury introduced a bill to the House of Lords on 20 April 1874, to limit the use of ritual, vestments, ornaments, etc., and to ensure all ceremonies were conducted according to the Book of Common Prayer.\\"[The] Public Worship Regulation Bill, for restraining ritualistic excesses in the Church of England ‚Ä¶ was introduced in the House of Lords by Archbishop Tait on behalf of the bench of Bishops, and warmly recommended to her Ministers by the Queen. Though viewed with much suspicion by the High Church party, who were strongly represented in the Ministry, the Bill proved to be very popular as one \\"to put down Ritualism\\", and passed, with certain agreed amendments, all its important stages in both Houses without a division\\" (Buckle, 1926b, pp. 299, emphasis added). In a letter to Queen Victoria, written on 7 October 1879, Disraeli, by then the Earl of Beaconsfield, in asking a favour of the Queen, makes it quite clear that the Bill was only passed after considerable effort on his part: \\"Your Majesty is aware of the great hostility Lord Beaconsfield excited against himself by carrying the Public Worship Bill \\"in obedience to your Majesty's commands\\".\\" (Buckle, 1928, p.51, emphasis added) Once enacted, many Anglo-Catholic clergy were charged with breaches of the Public Worship Regulation Act (1874); a number were placed on trial and at least five were imprisoned. Politician In a political speech in 1834, M‚ÄòNeile expressed his opinion on the oft-expressed view that clerics should stand aside from politics: \\"It was said that ministers of religion should not mingle in politics; but God, when he made the minister, did not unmake the citizen.\\"\\"Tory meeting at the Amphitheatre\\", The Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser, (28 November 1834), p.392, col.D. A \\"big, impetuous, eloquent Irishman with a marvellously attractive personality and a magnificent voice\\",Balleine, 1908, p.201. he had a considerable influence on the developing religious and political life of Liverpool: In 1835,See McNeile (1911), p.265. M‚ÄòNeile entered a long dispute, in which he was eventually successful, with the Liverpool corporation, which had been captured by the Whigs, after the passing of the Municipal Reform Act. A proposal was carried that the elementary schools under the control of the corporation should be secularised by the introduction of what was known as the Irish National System. The threatened withdrawal of the Bible as the basis of denominational religious teaching was met by agitation led by McNeile, who so successfully enlisted public support that before the new system could be introduced every child was provided for in new Church of England schools established by public subscriptions. At the same time, M‚ÄòNeile conducted a campaign that gradually reduced the Whig element in the council until it virtually disappeared in 1841. The defeat of the Liberal parliamentary candidates in the general election of 1837, followed by a long period of Conservative predominance in Liverpool politics, was largely due to his influence. Orator \\"His eloquence was grave, flowing, emphatic ‚Äì had a dignity in delivery, a perfection of elocution, that only John Bright equalled in the latter half of the 19th century. Its fire was solemn force. McNeile's voice was probably the finest organ ever heard in public oratory. His action was as graceful as it was expressive\\".(Sir Edward Russell, \\"The Religious Life of Liverpool\\", The Sunday Magazine, (June 1905); quoted in McNeile, R.J. (1911, pp.265‚Äì266). According to one observer, M‚ÄòNeile was \\"the most brilliant and highly-polished compound of natural and artificial advantages which I have ever beheld\\"; and, \\"as a specimen of appropriate action, refined oratory, stern, judicious argument, and commanding talent, all combined in one majestic whole, I may say M‚ÄòNeile is incomparable and perfectly unique\\" (Anon, 1838d).Random Recollections of Exeter Hall, in 1834‚Äì1837; by One of The Protestant Party, James Nisbet and Co., (London), 1838, p.110. M‚ÄòNeile was a tenacious, dogged, relentless, and formidable foe; and, along with his extreme verbal aggression, he was a man of the most imposing physicality. He was at least 6 ft 3in tall, thick-set, and broad shouldered. He walked with a slight stoop: ::He has all the appearance of a man of surpassing muscular power. The very aspect of his countenance bespeaks a person of great mental decision, and of unbounded confidence in his bodily strength. He is just such a person as, were a stranger meeting him in the streets, would be at once set down as a man who could, should ever the occasion arise, distinguish himself in any physical- force exhibition. No footpad would ever think of encountering the reverend gentleman, lest he should come off second best in the scuffle that would be sure to ensue. (Grant, 1841, pp.244‚Äì245) Preacher There were several extraordinary aspects of his preaching, and of the pulpit from which he preached. Almost without exception, and entirely removed from the firmly established Anglican convention, M‚ÄòNeile never preached from notes; and always preached extemporaneously.Grant, 1841, p.247. His sermons routinely lasted 90 minutes;The contemporary standard was something like 25‚Äì30 minutes at most; and never more than 40 minutes, even on some extraordinary special occasion. and were never measured, structured appeals to reason ‚Äì they were outright, impassioned histrionic performances intentionally directed at the emotions of his audience: ::\\"I shall never go to hear Mr. M‚ÄòNeile again\\", said a religious friend of ours, returning from St. Jude‚Äôs. ::\\"Why not?‚Äù, we inquired. ::\\"Because\\", replied he, \\"if I agree with him, I must come away with feelings of ill-will against parties he has been assailing and who are quite as respectable and intelligent as himself; or, otherwise, I must come away with sentiments of anger towards himself for his intolerance, if I do not agree with him; and I do not choose to go to a place of worship with the liability of leaving it in such an unchristian-like state of mind in either case\\".\\"The Rev Hugh M‚ÄòNeile + Malignity x Agitation = Mischief\\", The Liverpool Mercury, Vol.35, No.1766, (Friday, 14 March 1845), p.92, col.B. = M‚ÄòNeile's flawed hermeneutics= M‚ÄòNeile was well known for his flawed hermeneutics; viz., his inaccurate interpretation of Biblical texts. He was renowned for both his inaccurate exegesis,Exegesis ('drawing out'); an exegetical interpretation brings out the \\"real\\" meaning of a word or passage through an examination of the spiritual/literary heritage, and the textual, allegorical, historical, and cultural context of the word or passage by going beyond its literal meaning. and for his eisegetical projections of Biblical texts onto current events.Eisegesis (\\"reading into\\"); an eisegetical interpretation involves the deliberate imposition of one‚Äôs idiosyncratic impression of the moment upon the word/passage entirely on its own and in complete isolation from the actual context of the chosen word or passage. For example, in July 1846, Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, visited Liverpool and, among other duties on 31 July 1846, he officially opened the Albert Dock and laid the foundation stone for one of M‚ÄòNeile's pet projects, the Liverpool Sailors' Home. Two days later, on 2 August 1846, M‚ÄòNeile preached a sermon, \\"Every eye shall see Him\\";Revelation 1:7: \\"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him ‚Ä¶\\". the text of which was immediately published.M'Neile, H., \\"Every Eye Shall See Him\\"; or Prince AIbert's Visit to Liverpool used in Illustration of the Second Coming of Christ. A Sermon, preached [in Saint Jude's Church, on the second day of August 1846, the Sunday next after the Prince's visit (the Sunday After Prince Albert Laying the Foundation Stone of the Liverpool Sailor's Home).

Within his sermon ‚Äì regarded, overall, as a \\"most melancholy, wretched, and most degrading composition\\"\\"The Prince \\"In His Beauty\\", and the Parson (From Douglas Jerrola‚Äôs Weekly Newspaper)\\", The Moreton Bay Courier, Vol.1, No.41, (Saturday, 27 March 1847), p.4, col.C.; Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle, Saturday, 12 August 1846; and The Bengal Catholic Herald, 17 October 1846. ‚Äì M‚ÄòNeile moved to speak of \\"The Prince in all his beauty\\", mapping Prince Albert's laying of a foundation stone onto a text from Isaiah (33:17) \\"Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty\\"\\"Church Parties\\", (1853), pp.292‚Äì293. There were many protests at his equation of \\"the Saviour of the world\\" with a \\"colonel of hussars\\" and his implicit assertion that Albert held \\"title-deeds to‚Ä¶ divinity\\" (Anon, 1847h). It was clear his \\"fearful irreverence\\" ‚Äì implying that \\"an earthly prince\\" visiting Liverpool had some link to \\"the awful coming of the Prince of Heaven and Earth to Judgment\\" ‚Äì was something that \\"must be [immediately] apparent to every reverent mind\\"; and, further, that a \\"piece of gross and rank blasphemy [was perpetrated] by making the third Person of the Holy Trinity a type of Prince Albert\\".\\"The Prince, etc.\\"\\"We were [shocked] on reading the title of Mr. M‚ÄòNeile's recently published sermon. We could scarcely believe our eyes when we saw such language as the following:‚Äî \\"Every eye shall see Him, or Prince Albert's visit to Liverpool, used in illustration of the second coming of Christ\\". Many excellent persons have pronounced this as something worse that astounding irreverence, and are of the opinion that it would be just as proper to make use of the Prince of Wales's visit to Liverpool, in 1806, as an illustration of the first coming of our Savior. We never met before, the equal of this perversion of all propriety. \\"To illustrate\\", be it remembered, is \\"to throw light upon\\".\\" (\\"Astounding Irreverence\\", Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser, 14 August 1846, p. 394.) \\"[Its title] has been universally condemned; because no critic has yet been able to discover that the Prince's visit to Liverpool can in any way be regarded as a type of the Second Coming, or even, in the remotest degree, as an 'illustration' of that great mystery\\" (\\"Religious Gleanings (From The Bath Herald)\\", The South Australian Register, Vol.11, No.706, 17 February 1847), p.3, col.A. \\"The words \\"every eye shall see him\\" were applied to Prince Albert, and to those Liverpudlians who should stare at him. \\"From the sublime to the ridiculous there is but one step\\", and from the sublime to the blasphemous we fancy there is about the same distance. The Press, with one voice, protested against the selection of such a text on such an occasion, and the Prince himself was not flattered by it. Doubtless the doctor's loyal enthusiasm led him astray in this instance, as his Orange predilections have hurried him into opinions and observations, which, a few hours after he uttered them in the pulpit, he publicly retracted, and properly stigmatised as \\"atrocious\\"‚Ä¶\\" (Dix, 1852, p.95). = M‚ÄòNeile's immoderate preaching= Another extraordinary aspect was his propensity for \\"[being] carried away into confessedly injudicious acts and words, which many would wish unsaid, undone\\" (Arnold, 1875, p. 307). On 28 February 1847, he preached that the Irish Famine was an act of God's retribution, punishing the Irish for their collective sins and their tolerance of Roman Catholicism.The sermon was published privately by M‚ÄòNeile in 1847 and was widely distributed throughout his network of admirers. It also appeared later, as: \\"The Famine a Rod of God; Its Provoking Cause ‚Äì Its Merciful Design (A Sermon (on Micah 6:9) Preached in St. Jude‚Äôs Church, Liverpool, on Sunday 28th of February, 1847, during the Irish Famine)\\", pp.67‚Äì100 in Sermons by Eminent Living Divines of the Church of England, Contributed by the Authors, With an Introductory Charge on Preaching, by the Venerable Archdeacon Sinclair, Richard Griffin and Company, (London),1856. On the morning of 8 December 1850, when throwing \\"thunderbolts\\" at one of his favourite targets, the evils of the Roman Catholic confessional,M‚ÄòNeile‚Äôs issue was that, unlike the \\"general confession\\", that was part of every standard Anglican service, where each individual confessed silently and privately, direct to God, followed by a general \\"absolution\\" or \\"remission of sins\\" by the officiating cleric, the Roman Catholic practice was that of \\"auricular confession\\", audibly addressed directly to the ear of a priest. M‚ÄòNeile strongly criticized the conflation, within the \\"Romish Confessional\\", of spiritual sins and criminal acts. Perhaps, his last ever communication was on this topic: M‚ÄòNeile, H., \\"Confession in the Church of England (Letter to the Editor of The Times)\\", The Times, No.27966, (Thursday, 2 April 1874), p.4, col.F. M‚ÄòNeile made a series of outrageous statements of which, immediately after his sermon had been delivered, he denied any knowledge of ever having uttered; and, for which he specifically apologized at the evening service, and withdrew without reservation, as the following newspaper account relates: In 1851, these events were also presented as a classic example of \\"the dangers of extempore preaching\\" (Gilbert, 1851, p. 10). = M‚ÄòNeile's \\"Satanic Agency and Mesmerism\\" sermon = On the evening of Sunday, 10 April 1842, M‚ÄòNeile preached against Mesmerism for more than ninety minutes to a capacity congregation.His text was 2 Thessalonians ii. 9,10: \\"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.\\"See Yeates (2013), pp.273‚Äì308. He began, speaking of \\"latter days\\" ‚Äì following which, Christ would return to Earth, and peace would reign for 1,000 years ‚Äì and how, as the second advent neared, \\"satanic agency amongst men\\" would become ever more obvious; and, then, moving into a confusing admixture of philippic (against James Braid and Charles Lafontaine), and polemic (against animal magnetism), where he concluded that all mesmeric phenomena were due to \\"satanic agency\\".In particular, he attacked Braid as a man, a scientist, a philosopher, and a medical professional. He claimed that Braid and Lafontaine were one and the same kind. He also threatened Braid‚Äôs professional and social position by associating him with Satan; and, in the most ill informed way, condemned Braid‚Äôs important therapeutic work as having no clinical efficacy whatsoever. The sermon was reported on at some length in the Liverpool Standard, two days later.\\"The Rev. Hugh M‚ÄòNeile on Mesmerism\\", The Liverpool Standard, No.970, (Tuesday, 12 April 1842), p.3, col.G: the corrected text of the article is at Yeates (2013), pp.591‚Äì598. Once Braid became fully aware of the newspaper reports of the conglomeration of matters that were reportedly raised in M‚ÄòNeile's sermon, and the misrepresentations and outright errors of fact that it allegedly contained, as well as the vicious nature of the insults, and the implicit and explicit threats which were levelled against Braid's own personal, spiritual, and professional well-being by M‚ÄòNeile, he sent a detailed private letter to M‚ÄòNeile accompanied by a newspaper account of a lecture he had delivered on the preceding Wednesday evening (13 April) at Macclesfield,\\"Neurohypnology: Mr. Braid‚Äôs Lecture at Macclesfield\\", The Macclesfield Courier & Herald, Congleton Gazette, Stockport Express, and Cheshire Advertiser, No.1781, (Saturday, 16 April 1842), p.3, col.A: the corrected text of the article is at Yeates (2013), pp.599‚Äì620. and a cordial invitation (plus a free admission ticket) for M‚ÄòNeile to attend Braid's Liverpool lecture, on Thursday, 21 April. Yet, despite Braid's courtesy, in raising his deeply felt concerns directly to M‚ÄòNeile, in private correspondence, M‚ÄòNeile did not acknowledge Braid's letter nor did he attend Braid's lecture. Further, in the face of all the evidence Braid had presented, and seemingly, without the slightest correction of its original contents, M‚ÄòNeile allowed the entire text of his original sermon, as it had been transcribed by a stenographer (more than 7,500 words), to be published on Wednesday, 4 May 1842.M‚ÄòNeile, H., \\"Satanic Agency and Mesmerism; A Sermon Preached at St Jude's Church, Liverpool, by the Rev. Hugh M'Neile, M.A., on the Evening of Sunday, 10 April 1842\\", The Penny Pulpit: A Collection of Accurately-Reported Sermons by the Most Eminent Ministers of Various Denominations, Nos.599‚Äì600, (1842), pp.141‚Äì152: the corrected text of the publication is at Yeates (2013), pp.621‚Äì670. It was this 'most ungentlemanly' act of M‚ÄòNeile towards Braid, that forced Braid to publish his own response as a pamphlet; which he did on Saturday, 4 June 1842;Braid, J., Satanic Agency and Mesmerism Reviewed, In A Letter to the Reverend H. Mc. Neile, A.M., of Liverpool, in Reply to a Sermon Preached by Him in St. Jude‚Äôs Church, Liverpool, on Sunday, 10 April 1842, by James Braid, Surgeon, Manchester, Simms and Dinham; Galt and Anderson, (Manchester), 1842: the corrected text of the publication is at Yeates (2013), pp.671‚Äì700. a pamphlet which, in Crabtree's opinion is \\"a work of the greatest significance in the history of hypnotism, and of utmost rarity\\" (1988, p. 121). Aside from the newspaper reports of the M'Neile's actual sermon, there were at least twelve published responses to the published version of the sermon and its contents.The texts of the responses are at Yeates (2013), pp.701‚Äì739. Dean of Ripon M'Neile was in close sympathy with the philanthropic work, as well as the religious views, of the Earl of Shaftesbury, who tried hard to persuade Lord Palmerston to make him a bishop. Although Palmerston usually followed the advice of Shaftesbury in the appointment of bishops, he would not consent to the elevation to the House of Lords of so powerful a political opponent as M'Neile, whom Lord John Russell had accused of frustrating the education policy of the Liberal Party for thirty years.McNeile (1911), p265. On 13 August 1868, William Goode, the Dean of Ripon, the senior Anglican cleric in the Diocese of Ripon after the Bishop of Ripon, died suddenly. On 14 August, Disraeli wrote to Queen Victoria, recommending that the Queen immediately appoint M'Neile to the vacancy, arguing in support of his case that, \\"at this critical conjuncture [M'Neile] is gaining golden opinions all over England for his eloquent, learned and commanding advocacy of the Royal supremacy ‚Ä¶\\" (Buckle (1926a), p. 533). The Queen's detailed response, written on her behalf by Major General Sir Thomas Myddleton Biddulph, the joint Keeper of the Privy Purse, spoke directly of her reluctance: In his response, written on 19 August,\\"Mr. Disraeli to Queen Victoria\\", Buckle (1926a), pp.533‚Äì534. Disraeli replied that he had only recommended M‚ÄòNeile after the most anxious and deep consideration. Further, and given that he was being subjected to considerable pressure to elevate M‚ÄòNeile from a number of quarters (including \\"the vast number of letters [Disraeli] daily receives on the subject\\"), he strongly advised the Queen to appoint M‚ÄòNeile to the Deanery of Ripon, on the basis that he (Disraeli) had consulted the Lord Chancellor (Hugh Cairns, M‚ÄòNeile's nephew by marriage) \\"on this matter\\", and that Cairns was \\"very strongly in favour of the appointment\\". He also indicated to the Queen that, in his view, and regardless of her declared reservations, such an appointment was prudent: \\"the step ‚Ä¶ would be favourably received by the High Church party [viz., 'faction'], who feel that the claims of Canon McNeile cannot be overlooked\\"; and, more significantly, he noted that, if he were to be \\"overlooked\\" at this time, the pressures might become such that if he were to be \\"passed over\\" at this time, he might well gain an even \\"higher preferment\\" than the Dean of Ripon. M‚ÄòNeile was hurriedly appointed to the vacancy at Rippon,\\"The deanery of Ripon has been offered to and accepted by the Rev. Hugh M‚ÄòNeile, incumbent of St. Paul‚Äôs, Liverpool\\": London's Morning Post, Thursday, 27 August 1868, p.4, col.D. and was installed on 29 October 1868. He served in that position until he retired due to ill health on 31 October 1875. M‚ÄòNeile's statue in St Georges Hall M‚ÄòNeile‚Äôs statue Following his installation as the Dean of Ripon (on 29 October 1868), M‚ÄòNeile made his last speech in Liverpool on 4 November 1868. A group of his friends and parishioners, \\"having resolved to erect a full-length marble statue of him in Liverpool, in commemoration of his many valuable and long-continued services in the cause of religion and religious education\\", announced the next day that they were accepting donations to the Statue Fund, the maximum contributions to which were fixed at ¬£5.\\"Public Notice: Testimonial to the Very Rev. Hugh M‚ÄòNeile, D.D., Dean of Ripon\\", The Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser, No.6493, (Thursday, 5 November 1868), p.1, col.C. In May the following year, the statue committee announced that its target amount had been reached and that an eminent sculptor, George Gammon Adams, had been commissioned to produce the work and that Adams had already had several sittings with M‚ÄòNeile.\\"Local News: The M‚ÄòNeile Testimonial\\", The Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser, No.6493, (11 May 1869), p.1, col.C. The statue was carved from a pure white 8-ton block of Italian Carrara marble (the same marble as Michelangelo's David). Adams took 18 months to finish the , 3-ton statue; and it was finished in mid-October. On 28 October 1870, the Liverpool Council considered a request from the McNeile Statue Committee \\"that the statue be accepted for placement in St George‚Äôs Hall\\" (Cavanagh, 1997, p. 281). The suggestion it should place a statue of M‚ÄòNeile in such a conspicuous place of honour,The eleven other dignitaries so honoured were: Sir Robert Peel (1788‚Äì1850), twice Prime Minister, founder of the Conservative Party; William Roscoe (1753‚Äì1831), Liverpool patron of the arts; Sir William Brown (1784‚Äì1864), Liverpool cotton merchant, politician, benefactor of the Free Public Library; Edward Smith-Stanley (1799‚Äì1869), 14th Earl of Derby, three time Prime Minister; William Ewart Gladstone (1809‚Äì1898), four time Prime Minister; Samuel Robert Graves (1818‚Äì1873), merchant, ship owner, Mayor of Liverpool, M.P.; Edward Whitley (1825‚Äì1892), Mayor of Liverpool, M.P.; Frederick Stanley (1841‚Äì1908), 16th Earl of Derby, politician, Governor- General of Canada; Rev. Jonathan Brooks (1775‚Äì1855), Senior Rector and Archdeacon of Liverpool; George Stephenson (1781‚Äì1848), inventor and pioneer of railways; and Joseph Mayer (1803‚Äì1886), goldsmith, antiquary, collector, principal founder of Liverpool Museum. \\"produced an acrimonious discussion\\"; and, given the fierce objections by a considerable number present, the subject was deferred,\\"Local and General: A proposal to place a statue of Dr. McNeile‚Ä¶\\", The Leeds Mercury, No.10156, (Saturday, 29 October 1870), p.8, col.C. for the simple reason that every statue that had been placed in St. George's Hall up to that time, had been accepted by a unanimous vote. At the next meeting, on 9 November 1870, the first chaired by the new Lord Mayor, Joseph Gibbons Livingston (who was a strong supporter of M‚ÄòNeile), various motions were put, various amendments were proposed, and a number of very strongly held views were expressed.These strongly held views included: (1) His entire 34 years in Liverpool had consistently stirred up such ill-will among the classes, and such division between different sections of the Liverpool community, that any suggestion that he had a national or local claim to such a high honour simply beggared belief; (2) He was a clergyman of high status and pre-eminent in one of the Church‚Äôs largest divisions; (3) He had no national significance as a clergyman, because he only served the interests of one section of the Church of England; (4) He was an earnest, conscientious, zealous Christian, of the highest principles whose integrity was beyond question; (5) His extreme anti-Catholicism had insulted, antagonized, and alienated at least a third of the population of Liverpool; (6) His vicious attacks on those who did not share his religious views (Roman Catholics, Anglo-Catholics within the Church of England, non-Evangelicals, non- Conformists, and Dissenters, etc.) were so offensive that, if a statue must be placed in St. George‚Äôs Hall, it was better to allow considerable time to pass and the offence he had caused to dissipate; and (7) He was a well-published author on divinity and theological subjects, and a measure of his excellence was that his works had been reviewed in prestigious publications such as The Edinburgh Review and The Times. Despite the convention requiring a unanimous vote, it seems the majority (the final vote was 36 \\"aye\\" to 16 \\"nay\\") were prepared to take the view that, whatever divisive conduct M‚ÄòNeile may have displayed, he deserved recognition as a writer and orator, and agreed to place the statue amongst the other eleven local and national dignitaries (Cavanagh, 1977). The established Liverpool custom was a public unveiling, with \\"the most prestigious guest available invited to officiate\\". These were great popular occasions, wherein \\"extended eulogies [were] delivered by the succession of committee-members and honoured guests\\", reports of which were \\"invariably peppered with the parenthetic \\"cheers\\", \\"hear-hears\\", \\"applause\\" and, even, \\"loud and extended applause\\" from crowds that attendant reporters frequently emphasized \\"encompassed all classes and creeds\\" (Cavanagh, 1997, p.xvi). Yet, in the case of M‚ÄòNeile's statue, it was brought to Liverpool and placed on its pedestal in the dark of night, and was unveiled \\"without any ceremonial\\" in St. George's Hall, three days later, on the evening of Monday, 5 December, in the presence of the Mayor, the chairman, secretary, and other several members of the Statue Committee, several \\"ladies\\", M‚ÄòNeile's son, the Revd Edmund Hugh M‚ÄòNeile (who took over St. Paul's, Princes Park from his father) and the Revd Dyson Rycroft, Honorary Canon of Liverpool. Often, according to the established Liverpool custom, the sculptor would be present; and, on occasion, the sculptor might even deliver a short speech. In the case of M‚ÄòNeile's statue, the sculptor was the only one to speak; and, moreover, Adams had to unveil M‚ÄòNeile's statue himself.In Cavanagh‚Äôs opinion view, \\"McNeile, with his vituperative anti-catholicism, was perhaps such a controversial figure that even those councilors who had forced through his commemoration thought it wiser to abstain from such an open declaration of affinity\\" (1997, p.xvii). The final irony is that, of all the statues, \\"the only statue in St George‚Äôs Hall to cause offence because of the character of its subject, is also the only statue to have received unanimous acclaim as a work of art\\" (Cavanagh, 1997, p. 282): ::Mr. G.G. Adams, the artist who has given us the one good statue in St George‚Äôs Hall. ‚Ä¶ People may quarrel with the objects of the promoters of the memorial, but no one can withhold a tribute of admiration to the rare ability of the sculptor. (Liverpool Daily Post, 15 December 1870).Cited by Cavanagh (1997, p. 282). Death M‚ÄòNeile died in Bournemouth on 28 January 1879 after a short illness. He was interred in the midst of a severe snowstorm at Bournemouth New Cemetery on 1 February 1879. The funeral ceremony was officiated by the Bishop of Peterborough (his nephew, William Connor Magee (1821‚Äì1891)), assisted by his son, the Revd Edmund M‚ÄòNeile (1840‚Äì1893). Earl Cairns (1810‚Äì1885), who was related to M'Neile through his marriage to M'Neile's niece, Mary Harriet M'Neile (1833‚Äì1919), and Lord Shaftesbury (1801‚Äì1885) were amongst the mourners. Throughout the day the muffled minute bell of Ripon Cathedral was tolled and the cathedral's lectern and pulpit were each covered with a black cloth.\\"The Late‚Ä¶ \\", Leeds Mercury, 4 February 1879.

Since 2003 he has been a member of the Belgian Senate. He was a parliamentary chairman for the VLD in both chambers, from 1999 to 2003. Coveliers started his career with the People's Union (Volksunie), a Flemish nationalist party, but changed to the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) in 1992 together with some other frustrated party members. Within the VLD, he was part of the conservative wing, and he was open to the idea of working with the Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) and its precursor Vlaams Blok (Flemish Bloc). In 2004 Coveliers was co-founder of the Antwerp section of the conservative-libertarian organization Nova Civitas. He also in that time feuded openly with VLD party chairman Karel De Gucht. This resulted in Coveliers being ejected from the party on 8 February 2005, and starting his own political party VLOTT in the fall of 2005. This party is willing to work together with the Vlaams Belang (VB) and formed a cartel with it for the Antwerp city elections in October 2006. He also became the subject of the first known Googlebomb in Belgium. After the dismissal of Jean-Marie Dedecker from the VLD, Coveliers, Dedecker and Boudewijn Bouckaert (and other Nova Civitas members) started negotiations to form a new right-wing liberal party.

Life James was born at Blandford Forum. After seven years' apprenticeship to a linen-draper in Poole, Dorset, he decided to become a preacher, and in 1802 he went to David Bogue's training institution at Gosport in Hampshire. A year and a half later, on a visit to Birmingham, his preaching was so highly esteemed by the congregation of Carrs Lane Independent chapel that they invited him to exercise his ministry amongst them; he settled there in 1805, and was ordained in May 1806. For several years his success as a preacher was comparatively small; but he became suddenly popular in about 1814, and began to attract large crowds. At the same time his religious writings, the best known of which are The Anxious Inquirer and An Earnest Ministry, acquired a wide circulation. The Anxious Inquirer sold over 500,000 copies in his lifetime and was translated into more than a dozen languages. This was the book which D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones gave to his wife, Bethan, when she was seeking the Lord. The book was also of great help to Charles Haddon Spurgeon. In his autobiography Spurgeon wrote: \\"In an early part of my ministry, while but a lad, I was seized with an intense desire to hear Mr. John Angell James; and, though my finances were somewhat meagre, I performed a pilgrimage to Birmingham solely with that object in view. I heard him deliver a week-evening lecture, in his large vestry, on that precious text, \\"Ye are complete in Him.\\" The savour of that very sweet discourse abides with me to this day, and I shall never read the passage without associating therewith the quiet but earnest utterances of that eminent man of God.\\" James was a typical Congregational preacher of the early 19th century, massive and elaborate rather than original. His preaching was very popular and well received by serious Christians of the day. His doctrine was a moderate form of Calvinism, as had been that of Edward Williams, one of his predecessors. He published numerous books on practical subjects of the Christian life, including: The Anxious Inquirer, Pastoral Addresses, an Earnest Ministry, A Help to Domestic Happiness, Female Piety, The Christian Father's Present to His Children, The Young Man's Friend and Guide, and The Widow Directed to the Widow's God. Many of these are still available in print and widely used among Conservative and Reformed Christians in the USA (In England he is largely forgotten). He was one of the founders of the Evangelical Alliance and of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Municipal interests appealed strongly to him, and he was also for many years chairman of Spring Hill College, Birmingham. He was also an ardent slavery abolitionist, and is portrayed in the huge canvass depicting Thomas Clarkson's opening address at the world's first Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840, in the National Portrait Gallery, London.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon, accessed April 2009 He was a contemporary of William Wilberforce and Charles Simeon. John Angell James was keenly involved in all missionary endeavours and a supporter of the London Missionary Society. His name frequently appears in the Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle. In 1817 it was James who handed Bibles to John Williams (of Erromanga) and Robert Moffat, in the commissioning service which sent them off to their fields of labour. His fellow student at Bogue's Academy, Robert Morrison, gave him a lifelong interest in missionary endeavours in China and he was the main instigator of an effort to send a million New Testaments to China. In the event they raised enough money for two million copies. It wasn't uncommon for many parents of the period to name their children after John Angell James. John Angell James Wilcox, was the great grandson of Jonathan Edwards (theologian)' sister, Esther. John Angell James Sprague was the son of William Buell Sprague who was a regular correspondent with John Angell James. In August 1859, at the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone of The Metropolitan Tabernacle, Charles Haddon Spurgeon said, \\"Especially must I mention the name of that honoured father of all the Dissenting churches, the Rev. John Angell James, of Birmingham. There is no name I think just now that ought to be more venerated than his. We frequently exchange notes. I had a sweet letter from that eminent servant of God, in reply to one I had written asking him to come to this meeting. He said, 'I would have done so if I had been well enough, but I am unable to travel. My work is almost done, I cannot serve my Master much longer, but I can still do a little for Him. I preach perhaps once on the Sabbath, and I still continue to do what I can with my pen. What a mercy,' he adds 'to have been permitted to serve my Master so long.' I had written to him sometime before expressing my candid opinion concerning him, and my hearty respect; and he told me that I was mistaken in him. I am quite sure that I was not. I know that I could not think too highly of him.\\" John Angell James died less than two months later, at his home in Birmingham, on 1 October 1859. By special permission of the Home Secretary he was permitted to be interred in a vault beneath his pulpit in Carr's Lane Chapel, as had long been his wish. On 15 June 1970, when Carrs Lane Church was being rebuilt, the coffins of John Angell James and his second wife were disinterred and reburied at Witton Cemetery, Birmingham, in an unmarked common grave (Grave No. 147, Section 15). 'In Memoriam' Card for John Angell James A collected edition of James's works appeared in 17 volumes between 1860 and 1864. John Angell James's brother, Thomas (1789-1873), also became a pastor, based in London. His brother James was a deacon at Carrs Lane Chapel. His sister Harriet married Rev. Richard Keynes who became pastor of the Congregational church in Salisbury Street, Blandford Forum, where John Angell James had attended as a child.

Frances, a physician's daughter of independent fortune, resided in Hagley Road, Birmingham, in a house which was to become John Angell James's home for the rest of his life. They had four children: * Stillborn (1807) * Thomas Smith James (1809-1874) * Daughter (1810-1811) * Sarah Ann James (1814-1882) Frances (b.1783) died 27 Jan. 1819. John Angell James married (2) Anna Maria Neale on 19 Feb. 1822. Anna was the widow of Benjamin Neale (whom she had married in 1812). She had no children. Thomas Smith James (1809‚Äì1874) was a solicitor in Birmingham. He edited his father's works (Published in 17 volumes, 1860‚Äì4, by Hamilton Adams) in which he also defended his father's view of justification against criticisms made by his co-pastor and successor, R.W.Dale, who published The Life and Letters of John Angell James in 1861. (See Volume XVII of The Works of John Angell James, containing the Autobiography of John Angell James with additions by his son). Thomas Smith James also published The History of the Litigation and Legislation respecting Presbyterian Chapels and Charities in England and Ireland &c.;, 1867. Part of this work was earlier issued as Lists and Classifications of Presbyterian and Independent Ministers, 1717‚Äì31, &c.;, 1866, an 'Addendum' [1868] dealt with the criticisms of John Gordon. The work was inaccurate; it did contain \\"Dr. Evans's List\\" (1715‚Äì1729). His first wife died within weeks of marriage. He married a second time and had two daughters. He died on 3 February 1874.

In 1999 and 2003, Dedecker was directly elected to the Belgian Senate. In 2004 Dedecker ran for a seat in the Flemish Parliament, after taking his seat in the Flemish Parliament, Dedecker was elected by his colleagues as a community senator as well. He was a member of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD), before being expelled, and eventually sided with the N-VA party for a brief time in November‚ÄìDecember 2006. In January 2007, Dedecker presented his own political party‚Äî Lijst Dedecker‚Äîthat participated in the 2007 general election. Against all expectations, Lijst Dedecker got 5 elected in Parliament, and 1 in Senate. Dedecker became well-known first for his long career as a judo coach, with his judokas winning a for Belgium unprecedented number of medals (among them four times Olympian gold), and then for his politics. In 2004, as a pure outsider, he won 38% of the votes for the VLD party leadership against the party establishment. He was expelled from the VLD though in October 2006. Within the VLD he was one of the members that favours breaking the cordon sanitaire around the Vlaams Belang. In 2006 (as VLD member) he published a book, Rechts voor de raap, which became a national best-seller. In 2015, he was awarded the Prize for Liberty by the Flemish classical-liberal thinktank Libera!. VLD exit The 2006 Belgian municipal elections were lost by the VLD, also in Ostend, where Dedecker was a candidate. In Ostend, they lost out to the Socialist Party (SP.A), for which party president Johan Vande Lanotte was a candidate in the city. In the run-up to the elections, Vande Lanotte and Dedecker clashed severely, with Dedecker claiming that Vande Lanotte, as councilor and socialist party \\"strong man,\\" made Ostend the \\"Palermo of the North Sea.\\" The local VLD party in Ostend, led by Bart Tommelein, does want to pursue a city coalition with the Socialist though. Dedecker however stated, on election night, that the VLD with this result cannot be part of any coalition. Two days later, the national head of the VLD, Bart Somers, intervened, by stating that Dedecker will be removed from the VLD. Somers stated that in the last few days Dedecker has showed himself to be a \\"inveterate trouble maker who keeps on creating damaging battles in his own party.\\" Dedecker responded that \\"first they use me to attract votes in the local elections, only to put me on the street once the votes have been counted.\\" Bart Tommelein later on accused Dedecker of being \\"the largest Calimero of Flemish politics.\\" It was not unlikely that Dedecker would step over to VLOTT, a party being led by Hugo Coveliers. Coveliers was also a VLD member, but was ejected when he clashed with then party head Karel De Gucht. He openly invited Dedecker to start a VLOTT division in West Flanders. In an opinion article for De Standaard Coveliers wrote: \\"...I predicted I would not be the last one. There were still some independent minds running around that had to be tamed...Jean-Marie Dedecker goes out the same way: the party leader of the SP.A decides that the VLD has to bring a sacrifice, which the VLD executive eagerly fulfills.... They thereby relinquish themselves of a tough contender. These corruptible politicians would simply not allow any criticism.... There is no one left to oppose them now Dedecker is liquidated.... With his liquidation, the VLD merges left, soon to turn left, to the left side of society. Far away from the original liberal voters and principles.\\" Coveliers claims he was ejected from the VLD on command of (then) SP.A leader Steve Stevaert. Some believe the same thing happened to Dedecker, on command of Socialist Party leader Johan Vande Lanotte. N-VA entry and exit After being expelled from the VLD Dedecker looked into starting a new liberal party, which might have seen the involvement of Hugo Coveliers of VLOTT, and law professor Boudewijn Bouckaert. He made it clear that he would not join the Vlaams Belang, the largest right wing party of Flanders. In November 2006, Dedecker founded the right-liberal thinkthank Cassandra. On 30 November 2006 it was announced that Dedecker joined the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) on behalf of the N-VA party board, because it proved difficult in Belgium to meet the electoral threshold of 5% with a new party. The Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V;), with whom the N-VA had an electoral cartel agreement, stated they didn't want to be in league with Dedecker and broke off the association. On 9 December 2006, the N-VA party congress decided they preferred the cartel with CD&V; over Dedecker; afterwards Dedecker resigned from the party he joined only ten days earlier. Belgian cycling doping affair In September 2006, Dedecker told the press that he had the names of three Belgian cyclists, who went to Italy for illegal doping treatments. In January 2007, Belgian cyclist Johan Museeuw admitted that he took stimulants during the last years of his cycling career, and that he confided this earlier to Dedecker. The newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws claimed on the basis of various accounts of people close to Quick Step- Innergetic manager Patrick Lefevere, that Lefevere has pushed cyclists to use illegal stimulants. Lefevere is now suing Dedecker for ‚Ç¨75,000 over his earlier allegations about doping use among Belgian cyclists. The information Dedecker gave in September 2006 led to house searches throughout Belgium in June 2007 of persons related to cycling. The judiciary found various illegal substances during the search.

The village is close to the county boundary with Wiltshire and about east-northeast of Swindon. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,347. Shrivenham is located within the historic boundaries of Berkshire. The 1974 boundary changes transferred the Vale of White Horse to Oxfordshire for the purposes of administration. Character The Prince of Wales public house The Barrington Arms public house Shrivenham has numerous thatched cottages, stone walls, an historic pump and a parish church that is unusual for having been rebuilt in the 17th century. The village has three historic public houses: the Barrington Arms, The Crown and the Prince of Wales. Beckett estate Barnacle Lodge, built as an entrance lodge to Beckett Hall in the 1830s. The main country estate in Shrivenham is the Beckett Estate. In the 17th century it was the home of Henry Marten, the regicide. Later the Barrington family owned the estate and lived at Beckett Hall. The family and estate gave their names to Great Barrington, Massachusetts and Becket, Massachusetts. Charlotte, the second wife of the 8th Viscount Barrington, endowed the memorial hall in the village: it was opened in 1926 by Princess Beatrice, daughter of Queen Victoria. The hall and surrounding playing fields, known as Viscountess Barrington's Memorial Hall & Recreation Ground, are on Highworth Road. GI American University At the end of World War II in Europe, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women. It did this on the Beckett estate at Shrivenham. This, and two campuses in Europe, was set up to provide a transition between army life and subsequent attendance at a university in the USA, and therefore students attended for just one term (see G.I. American universities) UK military colleges Students take part in a life drawing class at the US Army University, Shrivenham in 1945. Shrivenham has been the site of UK military colleges since 1946 and the establishment of the Royal Military College of Science (RMCS) in the grounds of Beckett Hall. This college has since been absorbed into the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom. The academy provides higher education for personnel in the British Armed Forces, Civil Service, other government departments and service personnel from other nations. The current Director General is Air Marshal Edward Stringer, a senior RAF officer who took his post in 2018. The academy is headquartered at Shrivenham and delivers education and training in a number of sites. The majority of training is postgraduate with many courses being accredited for the award of civilian qualifications. The Conflict Studies Research Centre (CSRC) is just over the parish boundary in Watchfield. Joint Services Command and Staff College (JSCSC) is a British military academic establishment providing training and education to experienced officers of the Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Air Force, Ministry of Defence Civil Service, and serving officers of other states. JSCSC combined the single service provision of the British Armed Forces: Royal Naval College, Greenwich, Staff College, Camberley, RAF Staff College, Bracknell and the Joint Service Defence College, Greenwich. Initially formed at Bracknell in 1997, the college moved to a purpose-built facility in the grounds of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom at Watchfield in Oxfordshire in 2000.Ministry of Defence: The Joint Services Command and Staff College National Audit Office Report 2002 The Conflict Studies Research Centre (CSRC) was part of the UK Defence Academy. It specialised in potential causes of conflict in a wide area ranging from the Baltic to Central Asia. This geographical focus was inherited from the Centre's original incarnation as the Soviet Studies Research Centre (SSRC) in 1972, at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, examining the Soviet military threat. Renamed in the 1990s, the Centre later examined wider issues including foreign policy, energy security and demographic change. The Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre, the MOD's independent think tank, is also located in the area. Churches St. Andrew's parish church: vault of the central tower, circa 1400. St. Andrew's parish church: Jacobean pulpit and tester, circa 1638. Shrivenham had a parish church by 1117, when Henry I granted its advowson to the Augustinian Cirencester Abbey upon the latter's foundation. Little survives from the church of that time save for part of the west wall of the nave, which is late 12th century, and the font which is carved from Purbeck Marble. By the 15th century the parish church was cruciform, with a central Perpendicular Gothic belltower that was built in about 1400. The present Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew is the result of a comprehensive and unusual rebuilding in 1638, funded largely by the Earl of Craven. The end walls of the nave, chancel and two transepts were extended to form a rectangle with a nave of three bays with round arches on Tuscan columns with excessive entasis; a chancel of two bays; and north and south aisles running the full length of the nave, tower and chancel. The nave, chancel and aisles share one continuous roof. The central bell tower was retained in what otherwise was an almost completely new early 17th century church. A Jacobean wooden pulpit and tester and almost continuous panelling around the walls completed the interior. The building remains largely as it was completed in 1638, apart from the addition of a neoclassical west porch in the middle of the 18th century. Inside St. Andrew's are numerous monuments. The oldest is a stone recumbent effigy in the south aisle, apparently of a 14th-century woman. Many of the monuments from later centuries commemorate notable residents of Beckett Hall, including John Wildman (c. 1621‚Äì93), Rothesia Ann Barrington (died 1745; monument sculpted by Thomas Paty), John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington (1678‚Äì1734), William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington (1717‚Äì93; monument designed by James Wyatt and sculpted by Richard Westmacott) and Rear Admiral Samuel Barrington (1729‚Äì1800; monument sculpted by John Flaxman). The tower has a ring of ten bells. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the six largest bells, including the tenor, in 1908. Gillett & Johnston of Croydon cast the third and fourth bells in 1948. These were a gift from a US Army civil affairs unit that trained in Shrivenham before the Normandy invasion. The ring was increased from eight to ten bells in 2003 when the Whitechapel Bellfoundry cast the present treble and second bells. A Primitive Methodist chapel was established in the village in 1872. It is now Shrivenham Methodist Church. Economic history Aerial view of Shrivenham showing St Andrew's parish church. Elm Tree House, built of the local stone in about 1700, with Tuscan porch added later. There has been human settlement at Shrivenham from at least 400 BC. The remains of a Roman villa have been uncovered nearby. Shrivenham is part of Shrivenham Hundred which includes Ashbury, Buscot, Coleshill, Compton Beauchamp, Eaton Hastings, Longcot, Shrivenham, and Uffington. After the 19th century English hundreds effectively ceased to function, although they have not been abolished. The Wilts & Berks Canal from Semington on the Kennet and Avon Canal to Abingdon on the River Thames was built between 1796 and 1810. In 1805 it reached Shrivenham where a wharf was built. Coal delivered via Semington to Shrivenham peaked at 601 tons in 1840, when the Great Western Railway was built through the area and opened Shrivenham railway station. Coal deliveries by canal fluctuated through the 1840s and then collapsed from 272 tons in 1850 to only 28 tons in 1852 and none for most years thereafter, except for 27 tons in 1858 and 24 tons in 1864. Other canal freight also declined, and between 1893 and 1896 just 48 tons were shipped between Shrivenham and Wantage. In 1894‚Äì95 Ainsworth, a local canal carrier, handled 23 tons of freight at Shrivenham. By then the canal was increasingly in disrepair, in 1901 the collapse of the Stanley Aqueduct effectively ended the little remaining traffic and in 1914 an Act of Parliament formalised the abandonment of the canal. Shrivenham railway station continued to serve the parish until British Railways closed it in 1964. Literature National School in 1863.

He was the only child of King Emeric. Ladislaus was crowned king upon the orders of his ill father, who wanted to secure his infant son's succession. The dying king made his brother, Andrew, regent for the period of Ladislaus's minority. However, Duke Andrew ignored the child's interests. As a result, Ladislaus's mother, Constance of Aragon, fled to Austria, taking Ladislaus with her. Ladislaus died unexpectedly in Vienna. Infancy (c. 1200‚Äì1204) Ladislaus was the only known child of King Emeric and his wife, Constance of Aragon. The exact date of Ladislaus's birth is unknown, but it is likely that he was born around 1200, according to historians Gyula Krist√≥ and Ferenc Makk. After falling seriously ill, King Emeric ordered Ladislaus's coronation in an attempt to secure a smooth succession for his infant son. John, Archbishop of Kalocsa, crowned Ladislaus on 26 August 1204. Emeric reconciled with his defiant younger brother, Andrew, whom he had imprisoned. He set Andrew free, and made him regent for the duration of Ladislaus's minority. Reign (1204‚Äì1205) On 30 November 1204, King Emeric died, and Ladislaus succeeded him. Pope Innocent III sent a letter to Duke Andrew, warning him to respect the child king's interests. However, refusing to heed Innocent's warning, Andrew seized the money that Emeric had deposited in the Pilis Abbey for Ladislaus. Considering her son's position to be insecure, Constance fled to Austria, taking Ladislaus with her. Although Duke Andrew made every effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus before they could escape, they were able to reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric's and Duke Andrew's cousin, was willing to give shelter to King Ladislaus, although Duke Andrew threatened him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, and buried in the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Basilica.

He deployed historical and statistical methods to analyse some of the key economic and social questions in Victorian England. As an advocate of free trade and social justice he distinguished himself from some others within the English Historical School. Thorold Rogers, The Economic Interpretation of History: Lectures Delivered at Worchester College Hall, Oxford, 1887-8 (1891). Background and formative years Rogers was born at West Meon, Hampshire the son of George Vining Rogers and his wife Mary Ann Blyth, daughter of John Blyth. He was educated at King's College London and Magdalen Hall, Oxford. After taking a first-class degree in 1846, he received his MA in 1849 from Magdalen and was ordained. A High Church man, he was curate of St. Paul's in Oxford, and acted voluntarily as assistant curate at Headington from 1854 to 1858, until his views changed and he turned to politics. Rogers was instrumental in obtaining the Clerical Disabilities Relief Act, of which he was the first beneficiary, becoming the first man to legally withdraw from his clerical vows in 1870. For some time the classics were the chief field of his activity. He devoted himself to classical and philosophical tuition in Oxford with success, and his publications included an edition of Aristotle's Ethics (in 1865). Anecdotes Rogers caricature by Leslie Ward from Vanity Fair The Victorian journalist George W. E. Russell (1953‚Äì1919) relates an exchange between Rogers and Benjamin Jowett (Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography, 1914, 111‚Äì2) : 'Another of our Professors ‚Äì J. E. Thorold Rogers ‚Äì though perhaps scarcely a celebrity, was well known outside Oxford, partly because he was the first person to relinquish the clerical character under the Act of 1870, partly because of his really learned labours in history and economics, and partly because of his Rabelaisian humour. He was fond of writing sarcastic epigrams, and of reciting them to his friends, and this habit produced a characteristic retort from Jowett. Rogers had only an imperfect sympathy with the historians of the new school, and thus derided the mutual admiration of Green and Freeman ‚Äî \\"Where, ladling butter from a large tureen, See blustering Freeman butter blundering Green.\\" To which Jowett replied, in his quavering treble, \\"That's a false antithesis, Rogers. It's quite possible to bluster and blunder, too!\\"' Political economy Simultaneously with these occupations he had been studying economics. He became the first Tooke Professor of Statistics and Economic Science at King's College London, from 1859 until his death. During this time he also held the Drummond professorship of political economy at All Souls College, Oxford between 1862 and 1867, when Bonamy Price was elected in his stead. In this he became a friend and follower of Richard Cobden, an advocate for free trade, non-intervention in Europe and an end to imperial expansion, whom he met during his first tenure as Drummond professor. Rogers said of Cobden, \\"he knew that ... political economy ... was, or ought to be, eminently inductive, and that an economist without facts is like an engineer without materials or tools.\\" Rogers had a wealth of facts at his disposal: his most influential works were the 6-volume History of Agriculture and Prices in England from 1259 to 1795 and Six Centuries of Work and Wages; he spent 20 years collecting facts for the latter work. He served as President of the first day of the 1875 Co-operative Congress. He was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Southwark in 1880 and held the seat until it was divided under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. At the 1885 general election he was elected MP for Bermondsey and held the seat until 1886. Rogers also lectured in political economy at Worcester College, Oxford in 1883 and was re-elected Drummond professor in 1888.

Early life and career Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Breese was appointed a U.S. Navy midshipman in November 1846 and served in the sloop of war during the remainder of the war with Mexico. Sea duty continued until October 1851, when he was assigned to the Naval Academy to prepare for examination. Warranted a passed midshipman in June 1852, Breese took part in Commodore Matthew C. Perry's expedition to Japan for the next three years. In mid-1855, while serving with the Coast Survey, he was promoted to the ranks of master and lieutenant. He served in the sloop of war in 1858 and 1859, during the Paraguay Expedition, and off Panama. Lieutenant Breese's next duties were as an officer of the sloop of war , off Africa, in 1860, and of the steamer from mid-1860 until late 1861. Civil War service While he was serving on the San Jacinto, the Civil War began. He was present when she stopped the British steamship and removed two Confederate agents, an incident that provoked a brief crisis in U.S. relations with Great Britain, known as the Trent Affair. From late 1861 Breese commanded part of the flotilla of mortar schooners that helped capture New Orleans in April 1862. Promoted to lieutenant commander in mid-1862, he served with Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter on the Mississippi River and off the Atlantic Coast for most of the rest of the conflict, distinguishing himself during the Siege of Vicksburg, commanding 2000 sailors and Marines in the successful land assault on Fort Fisher, and as Porter's Fleet Captain. Post-war service After the war, Breese held various commands both afloat and ashore. Beginning in September 1865, Breese spent a year as Assistant to the Naval Academy's Superintendent, achieving the rank of commander while in that post. During the later 1860s and into 1870 he served on Navy boards and had ordnance duty at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. In 1870‚Äì1872 he commanded the steam sloop in European waters. He was Inspector of Ordnance at New Orleans for several months in 1872‚Äì1873, followed by two years as Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy, and as Inspector of Hydrography. Breese was promoted to captain in 1874. From mid-1875 until early 1879 he commanded the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, and had special ordnance duty. He was Commanding Officer of the steam sloop , the Pacific Squadron flagship, in 1879 and 1880 and, in 1881, was a member of the Board of Harbor Commissioners. Breese died at Newport, Rhode Island on 13 September 1881. Legacy The United States Navy has honored Breese's memory in several ways. The destroyer was named for him, as was a street at the Washington Navy Yard.

Background and education Horsman was the son of William Horsman, a well-to-do gentleman of Stirling, Scotland, who died 22 March 1845, aged 86. His mother was Jane, third daughter of Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet, and sister of the seventh and eighth Earls of Stair; she died in 1833. He entered Rugby School at Midsummer 1819, and afterwards proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, but did not take a degree. While at Cambridge he took part in three first-class cricket matches. He was admitted an advocate of the Scottish bar in 1832, but did not long continue to practise his profession. Political career Vanity Fair, 1872 As a moderate liberal he unsuccessfully contested Cockermouth in 1835, but was successful at the following election on 15 February 1836, and continued to represent the constituency till 1 July 1852. Defeated at the general election of that date, he was returned unopposed on 28 June 1853 for Stroud, and sat for that town till 11 November 1868. At the 1868 general election he stood unsuccessfully in Falkirk Burghs. From 11 May 1869 to his death he was member for Liskeard, but he had then so far separated himself from the Liberal Party that he was opposed on both occasions by more advanced members of his own partyin 1869 by Sir F. Lycett, and in 1874 by Leonard Courtney. Early in his political career (January 1840) Horsman, when addressing his constituents at Cockermouth, denounced James Bradshaw, M.P. for Canterbury, for speaking ill of the queen, and for secretly sympathising with the chartists. A bitter correspondence was followed by a duel at Wormwood Scrubbs, which was without serious results. Finally Bradshaw apologised. Horsman was from September to August 1841 a junior Lord of the Treasury in Lord Melbourne's administration. He criticised severely, and at times with personal bitterness, the ecclesiastical policy of Lord John Russell's ministry of 1847, as being far too favourable to the bishops. A vote of censure on the ecclesiastical commissioners was moved by him and rejected 14 December 1847. On 26 April 1850, in the discussion on the Ecclesiastical Commission Bill, Horsman smartly attacked the bishops, and roused Goulburn to denounce him as \\"a disappointed man\\" foiled of his hopes of office. In March 1855, when Lord Palmerston became prime minister and the Peelites withdrew from the cabinet, Horsman was made Chief Secretary for Ireland, and was sworn a member of both the British and Irish Privy Councils. He resigned the chief secretaryship after the general election in April 1857, and thenceforth assumed a more independent position in the House of Commons. With Robert Lowe, afterwards Viscount Sherbrooke, he resisted the Reform Bill brought in by William Ewart Gladstone in March 1866. John Bright, speaking on the second reading (13 March 1866), ascribed Mr. Lowe's hostility to Horsman's influence, and depicted Horsman retiring ‚Äòinto what may be called his political cave of Adullam, to which he invited every one who was in distress, and every one who was discontented.‚Äô According to Bright Horsman's party, to which Bright's sobriquet of the \\"cave\\" has since adhered, consisted only of himself and Mr. Lowe, but thirty-three liberal members voted against the second reading of the bill upon which the ministry was afterwards defeated in committee (18 June). Horsman maintained his independent attitude to the last. He best served the public by exposing jobs and other weak points in the ecclesiastical system. In 1841, while he was a junior lord of the treasury, he gained notoriety for attacking Lord John Russell's ecclesiastical policy in 1847 and subsequent years. In 1855, under Lord Palmerston, he was made Chief Secretary for Ireland, but resigned in 1857. He gradually took up a position as an independent Liberal, and was well known for his attacks on the Church, and his exposures of various \\"jobs\\". His name became principally connected with his influence over Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke in 1866 at the time of Gladstone's Reform Bill, to which he and Lowe were hostile; and it was in describing the Lowe-Horsman combination that John Bright spoke of the \\"Cave of Adullam\\". In the 1867 debate on extending the franchise, he said in the House of Commons: \\"There is an irreconciliable enmity between democracy and freedom\\". Family Horsman married Charlotte Louisa, only daughter of John Charles Ramsden, MP, on 18 November 1841. He died at Biarritz, France, on 30 November 1876, aged 68, and was buried there on 2 December.

The community of Bridal Falls is located adjacent to the falls and park was well as the interchange between the Trans-Canada and BC Highway 9 and has a variety of highway-based tourism services. It is located near the 38th highest waterfall in British Columbia (Bridal Veil Falls) and is commonly stated incorrectly as the 4th tallest in Canada. The falls drop 122 metres (400 feet) over a wide rock face, creating a \\"veil-like\\" effect, however, only the bottom 200‚Äì250 feet can clearly be viewed from the base, due to significant foreshortening due to the viewing-points' location at the base of very steep mountainside. It is located at the south end of the land set aside as provincial Park. Its source is from Mount Archibald and flows into Bridal Creek where it travels to Cheam Lake Wetlands Regional Park and finally to the Fraser River. During drier summer months, the volume of the water decreases significantly, reducing the visual effect of the waterfall. Bridal Veil Falls tend to freeze during cold winters and creates a wall of unstable ice. Because of this, the base of the falls becomes an extremely hazardous area and the park remains closed during the winter season. Bridal Veil Falls was named in the 19th century by the village of Popkum. In the early 20th century, the village utilized the waterfall with a hydro-electric generator to power the chalet and heated swimming pool in the village. Only the concrete foundation of the generator can be found today.

It developed from several local independent concerns and was incorporated in 1893. It was jointly owned by the Midland Railway and the Great Northern Railway, and those companies had long sponsored and operated the predecessor companies. The area directly served was agricultural and sparsely populated, but seaside holidays had developed and the M&GNJR; ran many long-distance express trains to and from the territory of the parent companies, as well as summer local trains for holidaymakers. It had the longest mileage of any joint railway in the United Kingdom. After 1945 the profitability of the network declined steeply, worsened by the seasonality of the business. It was duplicated by other lines and the decision was taken to close it. Most of the network closed in 1959, although some limited sections continued in use. Only a short section near Sheringham is in commercial use today, but the North Norfolk Railway is active as a heritage line. First railways The area eventually served by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, taken as south Lincolnshire and north Norfolk, was late to be supplied with railway connections. The Great Northern Railway, running north through Huntingdon, Peterborough and on to Grantham, so forming the western edge of the area, was not authorised until 1846 and not opened until 1848 between Peterborough and Lincoln. The Eastern Counties Railway, authorised in 1836, aspired to reach Norwich and Yarmouth, but ran out of money and stopped short. In frustration local people obtained Parliamentary authority for the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway in 1842. Running via Reedham it opened to the public on 1 May 1844. In 1845 the Railway Mania was under way, and a myriad of railway schemes was put before Parliament. Many of these foundered there, or were authorised but failed to generate investors' commitment. By 1850 the Eastern Counties Railway had recovered from its financial difficulties of 1836 and had connected practically every town of importance in East Anglia into its system. For some years the Eastern Counties Railway had successfully resisted the promotion of independent railways in its area but this could not continue indefinitely, and some local lines began to obtain authorisation. The East Anglian Railways company was an amalgamation of three earlier companies, the Lynn and Dereham Railway, the Lynn and Ely Railway and the Ely and Huntingdon Railway. The company became bankrupt early in 1851 and the Great Northern Railway, operating the East Coast Main Line at Peterborough, leased the line. Using running powers between its line at Peterborough and March over the Eastern Counties Railway, it intended to connect to Lynn via the Wisbech line of the East Anglian Railway. However the powers acquired from Parliament did not include a short section between the two companies' stations at Wisbech, and the scheme foundered. The GNR sold the line on to the Eastern Counties Railway in 1852. The financial performance of the Eastern Counties Railway declined over the years and in 1862 it was absorbed into the new Great Eastern Railway Company. Constituents of the M&GNJR; The western section of the later M&GNJRThe; ultimate formation of the M&GNJR; resulted from the fusion of numerous local schemes, though they did not at first aspire to form a connected railway. =Norwich and Spalding Railway= On 4 August 1853 the Norwich and Spalding Railway obtained its Act for a line from Spalding to Sutton Bridge, and from there to Wisbech. Notwithstanding the Company's title, reaching Norwich was an (unfulfilled) aspiration for later rather than an immediate intention. The Act stipulated that the other parts of the proposed Norwich and Spalding system could not be opened unless genuine progress was being made with the Wisbech connection. In fact at this time the money market was particularly difficult, partly because of the Crimean War, and the Company was unable to attract enough investment. It only managed to build from Spalding to Holbeach, miles, opening to Holbeach for goods on 9 August 1858 and for passengers on 15 November 1858. The Wisbech stipulation appears to have been overlooked for the time being. The line connected with the Great Northern Railway at Spalding and the GNR agreed to work the line for three years. There were four trains daily except Sundays, with one extra on Tuesdays. The eastern section of the later M&GNJRThe; company obtained a further authorising Act to extend from Holbeach to Sutton Bridge, as the earlier powers had expired. Wisbech was omitted this time, but the Act stipulated that no dividend might be declared unless the company proceeded with the promotion of the Wisbech line in Parliament. This was attempted in 1860 but rejected in Parliament, and again in 1862 and 1863. The GNR agreed to extend the working arrangement to ten years from 1 November 1861 for 50% of receipts and to carry out some permanent way improvements on the original section. The Sutton Bridge station was on the site of the later goods station, west of the River Nene. The extension to Holbeach was completed and opened on 1 July 1862. =Peterborough, Wisbeach and Sutton Bridge= The line connecting Wisbech to Sutton Bridge was considered important because Sutton Bridge was an important inland port. Wisbech would have been reached by a southward branch of the Norwich and Spalding Railway, but now an alternative means of making the connection was brought forward. On 28 July 1863 the authorising Act for the Peterborough, Wisbeach and Sutton Bridge Railway was passed. Capital was to be ¬£180,000. The Eastern Counties Railway had just been transformed into the Great Eastern Railway, and powers were to be sought by the PW&SBR; to connect to the GER line at Wisbech. The Norwich and Spalding Railway was given running powers between Sutton Bridge and Wisbech. It was the Midland Railway, not the GNR, that secured the contract for operating the new railway for 50% of receipts. =Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway= The next section of the future M&GNJR; to be built was the Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway, which was authorised on 6 August 1861 with capital of ¬£100,000. It was to connect with the Eastern Counties Railway (soon to be GER) at South Lynn. The authorisation obliged the company to construct a new rail and road bridge at Sutton Bridge, but this was modified by an Act in 1863 which permitted the railway to purchase the existing 1850 road swing bridge and adapt it for railway use as well. The line was opened for goods traffic throughout in November 1864 from a junction some distance south of King's Lynn station. Passenger trains provided by the GNR began on 1 March 1866. =Spalding and Bourn Railway= On 29 July 1862 the Spalding and Bourn Railway was authorised, also with capital of ¬£100,000. This line was to make an end-on junction at Bourne with an offshoot of the Great Northern Railway, the Bourne and Essendine Railway. The line was opened on 1 August 1866. It ran through practically unpopulated terrain. The GNR worked the line. Rivalry between the GNR and the GER The Great Eastern Railway was formed on 7 August 1862, from the Eastern Counties Railway and other concerns. The GER made it clear, not least by bitter Parliamentary struggles, to get authorisation for its own line or for running powers to get to Doncaster. Considerable quantities of coal were being brought south from the South Yorkshire Coalfield by the GNR, and the GER sought to take a share of the traffic. Fearing that this might happen, suddenly giving the GER a monopoly of the coal traffic to East Anglia, the GNR started to sponsor friendly railways in the area itself. PB&SBR; extending to Wisbech The Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway now in 1864 got authorisation to make a connecting line at Wisbech to the GER line, and to the harbour. The connection to the GER was in fact not made. On 1 August 1866 its main line opened for traffic. At Peterborough it started from the Midland Railway lines, on the west side of the GNR main line, and crossed both the Midland and GNR track by a bridge. The line was 27 miles in length, to a junction at Sutton Bridge. The Midland Railway worked the trains, working to and from the GER station at Peterborough and calling at the GNR station en route. (Those stations were later called Peterborough East and Peterborough North respectively.) Midland and Eastern Railway Spalding and Sutton Bridge railways in 1866The Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway and the Spalding and Bourne Railway amalgamated to form the Midland and Eastern Railway in 1866; the intention was to push westward to Saxby and join the Midland Railway there. This plan was opposed by the Great Northern Railway and the compromise was that the scheme was dropped, but that the Midland Railway was given running powers from over two GNR-sponsored lines: from Bourne to Essendine, and (by reversing there) from Essendine to Stamford; this was not a direct or fast route. The arrangement was agreed, and ratified by the Midland and Eastern Railway Act of 23 July 1866. The Midland and Eastern Railway was operated by the GNR and the Midland Railway jointly, authorised by Act of 1867. The Midland and Eastern Railway leased the Norwich and Spalding line, but the N&SR; remained nominally independent (until 1 July 1877). It needed to go to Parliament to plead that it had, in good faith, tried to make the Sutton to Wisbech line, but had been prevented; and that the line had in fact been built by the PB&SBR; this was accepted and the M&SR; was released from the prohibition on declaring a dividend. The Midland and Eastern Railway now effectively controlled the whole of the western section of the future M&GNJR;, except for the Peterborough to Sutton Bridge line, which was still controlled by the Midland Railway. The Midland and Eastern was jointly owned by the GNR and the Midland Railway, but it operated more or less independently. The Joint Committee did not meet between 1867 and 1880; trains of the two owning companies ran their own trains on the lines. In this period the network was referred to as the Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway. GN and GE Joint Line For several years the Great Eastern Railway had been trying to get access to northern districts, and had been frustrated by the Great Northern Railway's opposition. Nevertheless, the GER repeatedly presented bills for such lines, and the GNR calculated that it was only a matter of time until it was successful. This policy came to fruition in April 1878 during parliamentary hearings on a GER Bill, and negotiations were set in place to establish what became the GN and GE Joint Line, forming a through route from Doncaster to March. The GNR and the Midland Railway had hitherto dominated the southward flow of Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire coal, and saw that the dominance was vulnerable. This led the GNR and the MR to look favourably at further development of the Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway (Midland and Eastern Railway). Sutton Dock failure In 1875 Parliamentary sanction was obtained by an independent shipping company to develop Sutton Dock. Wisbech had traditionally been used as an inland port, but a Sutton Dock, connected to the railway network, could be advantageous, saving part of the difficult navigation up the River Nene. The GNR subscribed ¬£20,000, calculating that this could be an export point for coal. The dock opened on 14 May 1881, and a short branch railway had been constructed to serve it. The day after the opening it was observed that the lock gates were not watertight, and in fact a general failure of the wall of the dock took place. Ships that had entered the dock were got away, but repairs to the dock were said to be impracticable, and the dock was not used again; the GNR had by then expended ¬£55,000 on an unusable dock system. Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway Lynn railays in 1879Further east it was not until 1876 that the first railway section of the future M&GNJR; was approved: the Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light RailwayThis was before the era of the Light Railways Act, 1896, which obviated the securing of an Act of Parliament in some circumstances. was authorised on 27 June 1876; capital was ¬£98,000. The line would run north-west for 16 miles; the Yarmouth terminal, later to be known as Yarmouth Beach, was well situated for holidaymakers, but at this stage there was no connection to other railways. The first section, to Ormesby, was opened on 7 August 1877. From Ormesby to Hemsby opened on 16 May 1878, but there was a legal argument about a level crossing at Hemsby, and the next section to Martham opened from a temporary station north of the level crossing, on 15 July 1878. A temporary station south of the crossing was used from October. The legal position was resolved in Parliament in July 1879 and the permanent Hemsby station opened, and the two temporary stations closed. Meanwhile, on 27 May 1878 the company got powers to extend to North Walsham, and to change its name to the Yarmouth and North Norfolk Light Railway, with additional capital of ¬£60,000. Its status as a light railway was designed to prevent the Great Eastern Railway from acquiring running powers over the line. Successive openings took place: to Catfield on 17 January 1880 and on to Stalham on 3 July 1880. Lynn and Fakenham Railway Lynn railways in 1885On 13 July 1876 the Lynn and Fakenham Railway was authorised by Parliament, in the face of bitter opposition by GER interests. With capital of ¬£150,000 it was to run from GER-influenced connections near King's Lynn to near Fakenham. Surprisingly the GER made no attempt to take control of this line, in fact making obstructions to the construction process. It was opened to Massingham on 16 August 1879, extending to Fakenham on 16 August 1880. On 12 August 1880 the Lynn and Fakenham got approval to extend to Norwich, creating a much sought-after independent line to the city. The line was to pass through Melton Constable, and from that place there was to be a branch to Blakeney Harbour. On 11 August 1881 the Lynn and Fakenham and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk companies together managed at last to get powers to build from Melton Constable to North Walsham, which would connect their systems. In the same Act the Lynn and Fakenham got powers to build from Kelling to Cromer (not actually built), and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk was converted from a light railway to a full system, avoiding the speed and weight restrictions imposed by light railway status. The L&FR; opened from Fakenham to Guestwick on 19 January 1882, and from there to Lenwade on 1 July 1882. The final section to Norwich was opened on 2 December 1882. The Norwich station was named Norwich City from the outset. Melton to North Walsham was opened on 5 April 1883. Yarmouth Union Railway This short line (1 mile 2 chains) was authorised on 26 August 1880, to extend from the Yarmouth and North Norfolk station at Yarmouth to the quay, where it became effectively a tramway, joining the GE tramway there (but not facilitating any through running between the two systems.) The capital was ¬£20,000. The YUR itself was slow to start work, but with the assistance of the Yarmouth and North Norfolk the work was pushed forward and completed on 15 May 1882. Amalgamation: the Eastern and Midlands Railway Now the many railway companies that were independent of the Great Eastern Railway saw that amalgamation with one another was desirable. On 18 August 1882 the Eastern and Midlands Railway Act was passed, which arranged that on the first day of 1883 the Eastern and Midlands RailwayMidlands as opposed to Midland appears to be correct. Wrottesley uses Midlands consistently, as does Casserley on page 16, and Burgess in several places, and Carter on page 453. Awdry uses Midlands, page 125. Hopwood uses it However Rhodes uses Midland on page 12. Clark uses both in quick succession, quoting titles of Acts: Midlands on page 21; both spellings on page 22; Midland on page 23. was created by amalgamating the Lynn and Fakenham Railway, the Yarmouth and North Norfolk, and the Yarmouth Union Railway. Shares generally were transferred to E&MR; stock, but some preference shareholders retained their rights. By the same Act a second stage arranged that the E&MR; took over the Midland and Eastern Railway on 1 July 1883. The MR and GNR working arrangements were to continue on those affected routes, and the E&MR; could only run trains on those section with the consent of those larger railways. The whole line from Bourne to Yarmouth was now under the control of the Eastern and Midlands Railway. The train service at this stage was \\"lavish,\\" with six trains daily on the Lynn to Melton section and seven on Melton to Norwich, with numerous short workings. On Sundays it was made possible to spend the day in Yarmouth, by running several trains throughout or connecting in to those trains. Further openings The section from Melton to Holt was opened on 1 October 1884. King's Lynn was an important regional centre and port, and the E&MR; access to it was inconvenient, involving (from the east) reversal at King's Lynn GER station for through trains, and reliance on that company's grudging acquiescence. Thoughts had long harboured the intention of creating an independent through route and on 2 November 1885 the Lynn Loop was opened for goods traffic; passenger service followed on 1 January 1886. The line ran south of Lynn, connecting from South Lynn goods station to Bawsey. The former connection from Gaywood Road Junction, north of King's Lynn, to Bawsey was closed. The railways had referred to King's Lynn simply as \\"Lynn\\" but from this time \\"Lynn Town\\" was used instead. After a suspension of work, the Holt to Cromer section of line was completed by direct labour, and opened on 16 June 1887. A through Kings Cross to Cromer express started running in August 1887, and although the construction had been expensive, the boost to revenue from the new line was considerable. A second train was put on the following year, in the down direction consisting of coaches slipped at Peterborough from a GNR Manchester train. The time from Kings Cross to Cromer was typically hours, but the GER did Liverpool Street to Cromer in hours. At this time the decision was taken not to go ahead with the Blakeney Harbour branch from Kelling. On 20 June 1888 a new branch line from North Walsham to Mundesley, a small seaside resort was authorised by Parliament. Relationships with the Midland and the GNR For some years there had been continuing friction between the E&MR; (and its predecessors) and the Midland Railway over the routing for goods traffic. The E&MR; contended that the Midland was obliged to route it to Norwich over the E&MR; and not the GER, notwithstanding inferior transit times. The Midland repeatedly protested at Tribunals that no such obligation existed. Now at last a sudden rapprochement took place. A Bill was to be submitted to the 1888 session of Parliament to build a connecting line from the Midland Railway near Ashwell (in the vicinity of Oakham) and Bourne. The E&MR; was to build this with Midland financial help, and the following year the Midland would take over the entire western section. Traffic from the eastern section would be directed via the Midland. At a stroke this would have cut the GNR out of much of the traffic, even though it had constantly been friendly and supportive of the E&MR; when the Midland had treated it shabbily. This was \\"extraordinary conduct\\" by the E&MR.; Mr R A Read was a director, friendly to the Midland but prone to \\"rash and elaborate schemes\\", and Wrottesley attributes these schemes to him. Nevertheless, the new line was sanctioned on 28 June 1888, although a junction to the GNR at Little Bytham was inserted to mollify the GNR. In the months following the passage of the Act, wiser counsels prevailed, and the E&MR;, Midland and GNR boards negotiated a more congenial arrangement. The Midland and GNR would become joint owners of the western section; the eastern section would be unaffected for the time being. The route of the Bourne connecting line to the Midland would be varied, to meet the Midland at Saxby; the connection to the GNR main line at Little Bytham would be retained; and the connecting line west of that point would be Midland property, not E&MR.; Ordinary shareholders in the E&MR; would get ¬£47 for every ¬£100 worth. A joint committee met at Kings Cross on 5 March 1889; it was a Midland and Great Northern Joint Committee, but at this stage no such designation was applied to the railway itself. Eastern and Midlands Railway in chancery At the moment when the future seemed satisfactory, the E&MR; was plunged into crisis. For some years it had been paying only modest dividends, and profitability had not always been adequate to support outgoings. A Mr W Jones had been hiring carriages to the company and for some time had not been paid. On 27 June 1889 he obtained judgement in his favour, but the company had no money to comply. At the time there was a system established since 1867 intended to keep a railway in operation for the convenience of the public in this situation: in effect to trade out of bankruptcy. The \\"rash\\" Mr R A Read was appointed receiver, and at a shareholders' meeting in November 1889 it was stated that the company had liabilities of over ¬£108,000 on working costs as well as ¬£71,645 on unpaid debenture interest and guaranteed share dividends. At a further meeting on 2 May 1890 the debenture holders accused Read of being to blame for getting the line into this situation, and demanded his removal, as well as a declaration that their debenture payments should rank equally with the railway operating costs, contrary to normal practice when a line was in receivership. Appeals were eventually dismissed and despite the legal and financial difficulties the railway kept running. It was not until 16 August 1892 that a scheme of financial arrangement was finalised. Improvements despite the crisis While this was continuing, some capital improvements took place, largely funded by the Midland Railway, Signalling was modernised, some additional crossing places were established as well as some short lengths of double track, and the Bourne to Saxby line continued to be built. On 25 July 1890 an avoiding line at Spalding was authorised, enabling through running past the south of the town. It opened for goods traffic on 5 June 1893, and on the same day the Saxby to Bourne section opened, also for goods only. On 28 June 1892 the Sutton Bridge was authorised to be renewed. It opened on 18 July 1897; it was a swing bridge, and carried road and rail traffic. There were tolls on the road part of the bridge, but these were given up in 1902. The words Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway appeared in public timetables for the first time in 1890. The M&GNJR; is formed Cromer railways in 1906The 1889 arrangement whereby the Midland and GNR jointly took over E&MR; lines applied only to the western section. Now in 1891 the two larger companies indicated that they wished to acquire the eastern section too. This was agreed in October 1892, and a Bill was submitted to the 1893 session of Parliament. The consideration was ¬£1.2 million of Midland and GNR 3% rent stock, although there were complicated provisions for preference and debenture shareholders. Both eastern and western sections transferred to the M&GNJR.; With only minor interference from the GER, the new arrangement passed in Parliament on 9 June 1893: the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway would become an incorporated entity (rather than just a committee delegated by the two principals). 113 miles of railway were involved, so that the M&GNJR; network was the longest joint railway in the United Kingdom, by mileage. Saxby and the Spalding avoiding line opened to passengers On 1 May 1894 the Bourne to Saxby line was opened to passengers, with additional platforms at Saxby. The formation was made for a southward connecting curve there, but track was never laid on it. The boundary with the Joint Line was at Little Bytham as planned, and the formation of the connection to the GNR was also made, and here too track was never laid on it. the Spalding avoiding line was opened to passenger traffic on the same day, 1 May 1894. Mundesley to Cromer An Act of 7 August 1896 authorised the M&GJR; to build on from Mundesley (not yet open) to Cromer, passing south of the town and curving back to approach it from the west. The Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway Both the GER and the M&GNJR; wanted to build a direct coastal line between Yarmouth and Lowestoft; the coastal area and Lowestoft itself were developing and offered the M&GNJR; much potential. At the same time the GER wished to develop its access to Mundesley. Notwithstanding the friction between the two companies, a sensible accommodation was finalised on 18 March 1897 by which the GER Bill for the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line and a Mundesley to Happisburgh line would not be opposed by the M&GNJR.; The M&GNJR; would simply build a connecting curve from its line swinging round the north and west of Yarmouth and connecting in to the new GER line, and have running powers to Lowestoft. A Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway company would be created, and would control the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line (from Gorleston), the North Walsham to Mundesley line, Mundesley to Cromer, and Mundesley to Happisburgh. The M&GNJR; Bill for the curve at Yarmouth passed in Parliament on 6 August 1897, and the establishment of the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway was enacted on 25 July 1898. The Lowestoft line opened on 13 July 1903. Opening to Mundesley The Mundesley branch opened for goods traffic on 20 June 1898, and to passengers on 1 July 1898. As a joint line (from Antingham Road Junction) it had passenger trains of both companies: nine GER and seven M&GNJR; daily. Goods services alternated month by month. From 1900 In the first years of the twentieth century the M&GNJR; was doing well financially. Long distance expresses were run to the area from northern English cities as well as from London. Restaurant cars were put on, as well as workers trains for example bringing fish processing women from northern Scotland for seasonal work. Fish had become an important traffic since the N&SJR; connection to Lowestoft had been established. Although some short sections of double track had been introduced, the majority of the network was single line, and this brought challenges to timekeeping at busy times. The Midland and GNR were operating trains on the line as of right, and the GER had acquired running powers over several sections and to some terminal stations. Conversely the M&GNJR; needed the co-operation of the GER for some penetrating workings, at a time when competition with the GER was still intense. In May 1906 the Committee approved introduction of the Whitaker tablet exchange apparatus. On single line sections, head-on collision due to signalman error was prevented by a tablet system: drivers of trains entering a single line section must be in possession of a physical token, a \\"tablet\\" specific to that section, and one only could only be released from control equipment in the one or other of the two signalboxes controlling entry to the section. When the train had passed through the section the tablet was placed in the apparatus at that end of the section, and only now another might be released either there or at the other end of the section. When non-stopping trains passed the tablet had to be passed from the signalman to the fireman of the train, and this could not be done at speed without injury. Whitaker devised mechanical apparatus to be placed at the lineside and on locomotives to enable the exchange at a higher speed. During World War I many of the best long-distance express passenger trains were suspended for the duration; the M&GNJR; took on considerable additional goods traffic during hostilities, and many of the workforce left for the armed forces. The company maintained an armoured train, constructed by the LNWR at Crewe, continuously in steam from early in 1915 in case of enemy invasion. After the armistice, government control of the railways continued, and much traffic in demobilised servicemen tested the capacity of the network. There was a general railway strike in the latter months of 1919, and a coal strike in 1921, both of which caused considerable damage to the M&GNJR.; The national general strike took place in 1926. Grouping of the railways Wartime control of the railways ended on 15 August 1921, and the Government passed the Railways Act 1921, which had the effect of transferring most of the railways of Great Britain into one or other of four new large companies, in a process referred to as the \\"grouping\\". The Midland Railway was transferred to the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and the GNR and also the GER were transferred to the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The M&GNJR; remained unchanged, of course now jointly owned by the LMS and LNER. The rivalry with the GER was naturally at an end. The change took place formally on 1 January 1923. The long-distance express trains were reinstated progressively, and the LNER particularly emphasised Kings Cross to Cromer traffic. Holidays at the seaside increased in popularity very considerably after the war, and as well as trains to and from the area, local services for holidaymakers staying in the area were enhanced in the season. However road competition, both for goods and passengers, began to take a serious toll as roads were improved. at the same time a general depression in the agricultural sector harmed M&GNJR; income. =Incorporation into the LNER= The Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway had retained its identity at the grouping of the railways in 1923. In the mid-1930s there was good co-operation between the LMS and the LNER and in 1935 it was agreed that the LNER should manage the operational aspects of the M&GNJR; system. This took effect from 1 October 1936. The system consisted of , of which 40% was double track. World War II and after In 1939 World War II started, and once again most long-distance expresses were suspended; staff were called up or volunteered in the services. However the focus of defence, evacuation of children, and later the D-day landings was in the south, not the east. The war ended in 1945. The railways were run down during the war and the Government passed the Transport Act 1947, so that the railways became nationalised at the beginning of 1948. The long distance and holiday trains began to be restored, and holiday camp facilities became popular, and were served by the line. Local closures The very low usage of some parts of the M&GNJR; system after nationalisation could not be ignored, and some local closures started. On 6 April 1953 the Cromer to Mundesley section was closed, On 21 September 1953 the Yarmouth Beach to Gorleston North section closed.Passengers No More Second Edition page 110 Cromer High was closed on 20 September 1954, services being concentrated on the M&GNJR; station, Cromer Beach, which was extended and improved for the purpose. Eye Green, Thorney and Wryde stations closed to passengers in 1957 and North Drove closed to passengers in 1958. Diesel trains Diesel multiple unit vehicles were introduced on the M&GNJR; from 18 September 1955, gradually taking over the entire passenger service except the long-distance trains. Total closure In May 1958 a report was finalised by British Railways. It concluded that the entirety of the M&GNJR; was loss-making, and was largely duplicated by routes of the former GER. Complete closure of passenger services was proposed. Widespread closure of goods services too was contemplated, with only the Spalding to Sutton Bridge, Peterborough to Wisbech, South Lynn to Gayton Road, and Melton Constable to Norwich. The Melton to Cromer branch was to be unaffected by the proposals. The scale of the closure aroused considerable opposition, mainly focussed on the reduction in amenity to communities, although there was also widespread apathy, reflected in poor turnouts at public meetings. After deliberation the Transport Users Consultative Committee issued its decision in November 1958, that the majority of the proposed closures should proceed. Retained sections were Spalding to Bourne for goods, Spalding to Sutton Bridge for goods. A new spur would be built at Murrow connecting the M&GN; line with the GN&GE; Joint line; the Peterborough to Wisbech line would be disconnected at the Peterborough end, and served via the Murrow curve from Whitemoor, at March. Wisbech too would be retained and served from Whitemoor via Murrow. Further east the Melton Constable to Norwich line would remain open for goods trains, as would the South Lynn to Rudham line. Passenger trains would continue to operate between Melton Constable and Cromer, and between North Walsham and Mundesley. Yarmouth Vauxhall (former GER station) would be extended to handle the additional seasonal passenger traffic. The closures took place after the last trains on Saturday 28 February 1959. There was much greater public attention to the running of the last passenger trains than there had been to attending the public meetings, but the closure was decisive. Notwithstanding the dire warnings of protesters, a substitute bus service operating from Melton Mowbray to Spalding following closely the route of the railway was almost completely lacking in patronage, and was soon given up.

Key people William Marriott For over 40 years William Marriott served the M&GN; and its predecessors, joining the staff of the original contractors, Wilkinson and Jarvis in 1881, serving as Engineer from 1883, Locomotive Superintendent from 1884 and finally becoming Traffic Manager as well in 1919, before retiring in 1924. He is commemorated in the name of the Marriott's Way footpath, much of which follows the trackbed of the M&GN; Norwich line, and in the work of the North Norfolk Railway Murrow flat crossing At Murrow the M&GNJR; crossed the GN&GE; Joint Line on the level, one of few such crossings in the UK, and the only one where two joint lines crossed.  Locomotives  Because of the relatively early closure date, most workings throughout the life of the M&GN; were operated by steam power. A small number of diesel multiple unit services were run in the final years, alongside the very occasional incursions of early diesel locomotives. The M&GN; mainly used designs from the MR and GNR, but included in its stock some of the older E&M; engines, often much rebuilt. The famous Beyer-Peacock engines survived in this way from the early 1880s to the mid-1930s. The best contemporary designs were acquired by the Joint in the 1893 ‚Äì 1901 period, but as there were no more modern engines forthcoming, the light 0-6-0s and 4-4-0s provided much of the motive power on the line until 1936. From then on the LNER tried various designs on the line, not necessarily bigger or even more recent than the Joint's own engines, but as the M&GN;'s engines were scrapped, newer engines such as the K2 2-6-0s and B12 4-6-0s became common. The ex-GER \\"Claud Hamilton\\" 4-4-0s provided the locomotive backbone of this later period. From the 1950s, Ivatt 4MTs became the dominant motive power on the system, which achieved a higher degree of standardisation than any other part of British Railways‚Äîmore than 50 of these \\"mucky ducks\\" were allocated here. But there were other types still in use, and among them the line saw Ivatt 2MTs and occasional Standard 4MT and LNER B1 and B17 types. British Railways' Eastern Region was an early adopter of diesel motive power and the M&GN; lines were used by Brush Type 2 locomotives and several early DMU types including Class 101 and Class 105s. A fleet of the latter was commissioned in the mid-1950s to take over all the long-distance locomotive-hauled passenger services, but the line's closure in 1959 saw them re-allocated (especially to the Great Northern suburban commuter workings out of King's Cross, for which they were particularly unsuitable). One M&GN; boiler from a Hudswell Clarke 4-4-0T survives, it is hoped this will be rebuilt as a static exhibit.  Badge and livery  Norfolk Green bus painted in the M&GN; livery The M&GN; device consists of images derived from the Coats of Arms of the four principal cities and towns it served: (clockwise from top left) Peterborough, Norwich, Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn. For much of the company's life the locomotives were painted a light golden brown, often referred to by paintshop staff as \\"autumn leaf\\" or \\"golden ochre\\". From 1922 the goods engines were painted dark brown, followed by the rest of the locomotives in 1929. The LNER painted the survivors black. Most of the carriages were ex-GNR and were varnished teak, but some of the older stock and rebuilds were painted and grained to look like teak. Wagon stock was generally brown oxide, the same colour as the GNR used, until 1917 when general stock under the common user agreement began to be painted grey. The number of M&GN; wagons declined during the 1920s, and were eventually bought by the parent companies in 1928, leaving only service stock, which was painted red oxide. Under British Railways' control, carriages were often carmine and cream, then maroon. Cultural impact and heritage Preserved brake van No. 12 restored and in operation on the NNR. The M&GN; was frequently referred to as the \\"Muddle and Go Nowhere\\", a fairly self-evident title for a route that served a mostly rural region, but after closure this phrase was commonly replaced with \\"Missed and Greatly Needed\\". The M&GN;'s memory is kept alive by two heritage railway operations and railway museums. Whilst only the short section between Cromer Beach and Sheringham remains open to regular services, the section of branch line between Sheringham and Holt is operated as the North Norfolk Railway. The station at Whitwell also operates as a heritage centre, with ambitions to restore a section of the M&GN; main line. There is also a group dedicated to the study of the line: the M&GN; Circle. M&GN; signal boxes survive at numerous locations, with Cromer Beach 'box being open to the public. The 'box from Honing also survives at the Barton House Railway near Wroxham. The turntable from Bourne engine shed has also survived. This turntable was built in Ipswich in 1933 and installed at Bourne. When the shed closed along with the line in 1959 it was transferred to Peterborough East railway station. After that shed closed the turntable was rebuilt at Wansford station on the Nene Valley railway Very little rolling stock from the line has been preserved. The North Norfolk Railway have rescued two passenger coaches and a brake van, while a third passenger coach has recently been preserved by the Whitwell & Reepham Railway. Another M&GN; brake van survives, No. 23 which was built in 1899, was rescued from Melton Constable in 2000.http://www.ws.rhrp.org.uk/ws/WagonInfo.asp?Ref=8217 Two more M&GN; coaches survive, No. 40 and 41 (originally GNR), No. 40 is preserved in Alysham http://www.cs.rhrp.org.uk/se/CarriageInfo.asp?Ref=6007 and No. 41 survives at the former Raynham Station platform and building. http://www.cs.rhrp.org.uk/se/CarriageInfo.asp?Ref=5552 No locomotives survived, with the last complete locomotive being scrapped at the Longmoor Military Railway in 1953. The \\"golden ochre\\" livery has been carried by two industrial locomotives on the North Norfolk Railway, and was later worn by a bus operated by Norfolk Green on routes formerly served by the company.

History Built in the 1950s, Bentilee was at that time one of the largest estates in Europe, with around 4,500 properties. The streets in the area are named after various places in the UK e.g. Winchester Avenue, Chelmsford Drive, and Devonshire Square. Originally, it consisted almost wholly of social housing, managed by Stoke City Council. The Right to Buy brought in by the Conservative government of the 1980s led to many of the semi-detached houses that make up most of the housing stock in the area being bought by their tenants, so that now approximately 25% of local houses are privately owned. In the 1990s, the estate's 925 cottage flats were transferred to the management of Bentilee Community Housing Limited (now called EPIC), under the Estates Action scheme that provided government funding to bring the properties up to a modern standard with many receiving new kitchens, new bathrooms, central heating, double-glazing, and rewiring. Recent developments In recent history, the estate has also been the subject of a 7-year-long Villages Initiative Single Regeneration Budget (Round 2) urban renewal scheme that aimed to do for the remaining council housing what the Estates Action scheme had done for the cottage flats (but without transferring ownership away from the Council), as well as tackling local social issues and full- or part- funding a wide range of local projects such as Berryhill Retirement Village, the Millennium Project on the Berryhill Fields that separate Bentilee from Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, and building the Moss Green housing estate (managed by Riverside Housing). Seven years was not long enough to complete the ambitious plans for the redevelopment of the estate's main shopping and services area so the Bentilee District Centre Project was set up to carry on this work. The final result is a single building comprising shopping facilities, local library, IT Centre, walk-in health centre, and the CAB ‚Äî unique in the UK. In 2013 Discovery Academy was built on the site of the former Willfield Centre. Discovery Academy replaced Mitchell High School in Bucknall and Edensor High School in Longton.

Akaden painting By request from a questionnaire at the 100th-anniversary event of the Tamagawa Line, from January 24, 2018, Seibu Railway's old livery \\"Akaden Paint\\" (red x beige) was used. Two-tone color From April 18, 2018, the trains were reprinted with the two-tone color of yellow x beige. The paint color is derived from the livery that was used during the time of the debut of the New 101 series train. The livery was also used before the fleet renewal of 2010, as the Old 101 Series train was featured in the same livery. This livery was the most requested after Akaden painting in the questionnaire at the 100th- anniversary event of Tamagawa Line.

These trains originally were introduced as \\"One-Man\\" („ÉØ„É≥„Éû„É≥) services. Prior to the One-Man train service on the New 101 Series The follwing trains were also used: The 401 series, 701 series, which had been transferred from the Shinjuku line system to the Tamagawa line, and the 451 series, 551 series, and the 571 series, which were called Akaden trains due to their red and beige livery. History The first section of the line, between Musashi-Sakai and Kita-Tama Station (present-day Shiraitodai Station), opened on 22 October 1917. The line was extended to Koremasa on 20 June 1922. In 1927, the company was absorbed by the Seibu Railway. The entire line was electrified in 1950. Freight operations ceased in 1967.

All three positions, plus others, were appointed to Matthew by Elizabeth I. Eventually, he was appointed Archbishop of York in 1606 by Elizabeth's successor, James I. Early life He was the son of Sir John Matthew of Ross in Herefordshire, England, and of his wife Eleanor Crofton of Ludlow. Tobias was born at Bristol on 13 June 1546. Matthew was educated at Wells, Somerset, and then in succession at University College and Christ Church, Oxford.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Mascall-Meyrick He proceeded BA in 1564, and MA in 1566. (father and son article) Ties to Elizabeth I He attracted the favourable notice of Elizabeth I, and his rise was steady though not quite rapid. He was first appointed a public orator in Oxford in 1569, and then President of St John's in 1572, Dean of Christ Church in 1576, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in 1579, Dean of Durham in 1583, Bishop of Durham in 1595, and Archbishop of York in 1606. Years as Archbishop In 1581, Matthew had a controversy with the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and published at Oxford his arguments in 1638 under the title, Piissimi et eminentissimi viri Tobiae Matthew, archiepiscopi olim Eboracencis concio apologetica adversus Campianam. While in the north he was active in forcing the recusants to conform to the Church of England, preaching hundreds of sermons and carrying out thorough visitations. In 1617, he delegated his trusted lieutenant Phineas Hodson to advise Roger Brearley, who had founded the Grindletonian nonconformist sect and been accused of heresy as a result, on how he might reconcile with the Church of England. Final years and death During his later years he was to some extent in opposition to the administration of King James I. He was exempted from attendance in the parliament of 1625 on the ground of age and infirmities. His wife, Frances, was the daughter of William Barlow, Bishop of Chichester. His son, Tobie Matthew was an MP and later a convert to Roman Catholicism. He died at Cawood on 20 March 1628 at 81 years old; he was buried in the Lady Chapel of York Minster.

Prior to his appointment he also served for several years in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and as a state senator. In 1847 Shaw became the father-in-law of author Herman Melville. He ruled on prominent cases involving slavery, segregation, and religion. Early life and education Shaw was born in West Barnstable, Massachusetts, the second son of Oakes Shaw and his second wife Susanna, who was a daughter of John H. Hayward of Braintree. The Shaws were descendants of Abraham Shaw (January 2, 1590 ‚Äì November 2, 1638), who left Halifax, England in 1636 and settled in Dedham. Oakes Shaw, a Congregationalist minister, was pastor of the West Church in Barnstable for forty-seven years. Lemuel was named for his uncle, Dr. Hayward of Boston, father of George Hayward, the surgeon. Educated at home by his father except for a few months at Braintree, he entered Harvard in 1796. There, he taught school in winter vacations. After graduating with high honors in 1800, he taught for a year in a Boston public school, and wrote articles and read proof for the Boston Gazette, a Federalist newspaper. In August 1801, he began studying law in Boston under David Everett. Meanwhile, he learned French proficiently from a refugee, Antoine Jay, afterwards a founder in France of the liberal newspaper Le Constitutionnel. In 1802, he moved with Everett to Amherst, New Hampshire, where besides doing legal work he contributed a poem on dancing and translations from French to the Farmers' Cabinet, a local newspaper. He became engaged to Nancy Melvill, daughter of Maj. Thomas Melvill of Boston (the subject of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.'s poem \\"The Last Leaf\\") but she died soon afterward. Legal and political career Admitted to the bar in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, in September 1804, and in Plymouth County, Massachusetts that November, Shaw began practice in Boston. When his associate left Boston after being acquitted of murder in a political quarrel, he practiced alone for fifteen years. In about 1822, Shaw took Sidney Bartlett, an able trial lawyer, as his junior partner. His practice gradually became large, but he was less known as an advocate than as the adviser of important commercial enterprises. Portrait photograph In politics, Shaw was first a Federalist and later a Webster Whig, but remained all his life a free-trader. He attended Unitarian services, though he was never a communicant. Fond of entertaining and dining out, he was simple and affectionate in his home life, his interest in the social events of his household extending to the minutest details. Shaw was prepared for his judicial career by numerous public positions. He was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving in 1811‚Äì14, 1820 and 1829, and as a state senator in 1821‚Äì22. He served as a member of the constitutional convention of 1820. He also held many offices in Boston. Shaw was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823. In 1822, with few precedents to guide him, he drafted the first charter of the city, which lasted until 1913. Chief Justice of Massachusetts On the death of Chief Justice Isaac Parker, Governor Levi Lincoln offered Shaw an appointment as Chief Justice. Daniel Webster successfully urged Shaw to accept, though it meant giving up a practice of $15,000 to $20,000 a year for a salary of $3,500. And for this, if nothing else, Webster later thought the public owed him a debt of gratitude. Shaw's commission was issued August 30, 1830, and he served 30 years, resigning August 21, 1860. During his tenure as Chief Justice, Shaw is reported to have heard between 2,000 and 2,200 cases; many would help shape American law and jurisprudence. His exceptionally long judicial career coincided with the development of many important industries, so that he made law on such matters as water power, railroads and other public utilities. Probably no other state judge has so deeply influenced commercial and constitutional law throughout the nation. An opinion by Shaw rarely lends itself to isolated quotations; its strength lies in the entire solidity of its reasoning. \\"His words had weight rather than brilliancy or eloquence\\",Chase, 278 and his greatness came from his personality as well as from his intellectual powers. He was no mere writer of opinions, but preeminently a magistrate. His skill in expounding the fellow-servant rule considerably delayed the replacement of that rule by workmen's compensation. In Shaw's time, the chief justice sat often at trials. In such work he was thorough, systematic, and patient, with a remarkable power to charge juries so that they understood the exact questions before them. =Slavery and civil rights= Because of Boston's strong abolitionist movement, Shaw oversaw numerous cases related to slave law and race. In 1836, Shaw's opinion in Commonwealth v. Aves held that a slave brought voluntarily into Massachusetts, a free state, was a \\"sojourner,\\" or a journeyer, and not taking domicile in that state. Therefore, slaves could be brought into the state only for a limited time. Abolitionists, who had brought the habeas corpus suit, wanted a rule which would have freed the girl, while southern defenders of the practice wanted the court to uphold the concept of comity and acknowledge the legality of slavery. Shaw attempted to split the decision by applying the archaic \\"sojourner\\" status to slaves. Further, Shaw rejected the doctrine of interstate comity. In his strict understanding, comity is a vehicle for facilitating trade and amicable interactions between jurisdictions. Therefore, Shaw reasoned that a state or jurisdiction is not required to honor comity if in doing so it is sanctioning practices repugnant to the state's own norms. The Aves case caused an uproar in the South where planters accused the Northerners of denying their equal sovereign status. Shaw also drew criticism from conservative jurists in other Northern states, as in State v. Post (N.J. 1845). His ruling in favor of the constitutionality of school segregation in Roberts v. City of Boston (1849) established \\"separate but equal\\" as a legal doctrine in the state. In a later case, he again refused to release fugitive slave Thomas Sims on habeas corpus grounds, as he felt bound by the Constitution and the law, as the recent Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required states and local governments to cooperate in the capture of escaped slaves. =Commonwealth v. Webster (1850)= No single case brought Shaw such criticism or such respect as the Parkman‚ÄìWebster murder case, i.e. Commonwealth v. Webster, held in Boston in March 1850. > While Shaw was Chief Justice, the Supreme Judicial Court still possessed > exclusive jurisdiction over all capital crimes: capital cases were tried by > a jury presided over by the Chief Justice attended by his associate > justices. At such a trial all points of law were argued fully by counsel and > settled on the spot by decisions as 'final and conclusive' as those of the > highest appellate court on a bill of exceptions. Such an accommodation was rooted in the consideration that the defendant and the public had a unique interest in securing, in the first instance, a verdict based on correct and authoritative rulings and, therefore, in avoiding repeated trials. The trial lasted eleven days with the court sitting from nine in the morning until seven in the evening with a lunch break of one and one- half hours. Joel Parker, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Chief Justice of New Hampshire, 1838 to 1848, noted that \\"the trial, in the course of its progress, was a cause of extreme excitement, extending through the whole length and breadth of the land, and reaching even into foreign countries.\\" Parker, 179 On March 30, after the defense's closing remarks were concluded, after the prosecution's closing remarks lasting nearly five hours and after a brief un-sworn statement by the defendant himself, Chief Justice Shaw delivered a three hours long charge to the jury. Frederick Hathaway Chase in his 1918 biography of Shaw wrote: \\"Probably no charge ever delivered in this country has been followed as a precedent so frequently and so closely as this memorable effort. With the dignity of expression and the clearness of thought and language ... he expounded the law of homicide in terms which have been followed closely in nearly every murder trial from that day to this.\\"Chase, 200 In his charge to the jury, sometimes referred to as \\"the Webster charge\\", Shaw reviewed and/or refuted portions of the testimony heard and, in turn, defined murder, manslaughter, circumstantial evidence and reasonable doubt. Chase notes that regarding Shaw's review of the evidence presented that \\"it must be remembered that at the time when this case was tried there was no statute forbidding the court to charge upon the facts. It was within the power of the court at that time, as it is not now, to express an opinion as to the weight of evidence.\\"Chase, 205 Shaw's charge to the jury was something less than unanimously well received in 1850. One pamphleteer at the time, identifying himself only as a \\"Member of the Legal Profession\\" wrote: > It seems scarcely credible that Judge Shaw could have given utterance to the > language published in his \\"charge to the jury.\\" From the beginning to the > end it is but an argument against the prisoner. An argument with all the > moral force of a dictation to the jury, a dictation which makes a pretended > trial by twelve men a mockery and a farce. ... What ulterior purpose was to > be accomplished or what feeling of interest or resentment was to be > gratified by such an extraordinary judicial usurpation as this we do not > pretend even to conjecture; but we do not hesitate to declare that to find a > parallel for such an unscrupulous prostitution of dignity, such an > unblushing betrayal of the judicial office, we must go back to the days of > Jeffreys.Sullivan, 143 The definition of murder as stated by Shaw was \\"the killing of any person in the peace of the Commonwealth, with malice aforethought, either express or implied by law.\\" Malice, as defined by the Chief Justice, included \\"not only anger, hatred and revenge, but every other unlawful and unjustifiable motive.\\" Manslaughter was defined by Shaw as \\"the unlawful killing of another without malice\\".Bemis, 456 The distinction, as Leonard Williams Levy notes, is \\"..no small matter, particularly to the accused whose life is at stake. The existence of malice distinguishes murder from manslaughter, and manslaughter, the unlawful killing of a human being without malice, does not carry the death penalty.\\"Levy, 221 Portrait by William Morris Hunt Having made the distinction in the law between murder and manslaughter, Shaw then argued, \\"Upon this subject, the rule as deduced from the authorities is, that the implication of malice arises in every case of intentional homicide; and, the fact of killing being first proved, all the circumstances of accident, necessity, or infirmity, are to be satisfactorily established by the party charged, unless they arise out of the evidence produced against him to prove the homicide, and the circumstances attending it.\\"Bemis, 457 While this would appear to be contrary to the principle of \\"innocent until proven guilty,\\" Shaw's charge to the jury has been interpreted to mean that if the prosecution's evidence proves that a life was taken and does not produce any evidence of extenuating circumstances, the law will imply that malice existed. It then, and only then, becomes the defense's burden to show extenuating circumstances.Chase, 201 and Levy, 221 In 1850, the law required the prosecution to prove the existence of a crime, that is, the corpus delicti. In murder cases this had generally meant that the prosecution had to physically produce the corpse of the person alleged to have been murdered. In that only body parts and some teeth had been found, Shaw stated, > This case is to be proved, if proved at all, by circumstantial evidence; > because it is not suggested that any direct evidence can be given, or that > any witness can be called to give direct testimony upon the main fact of the > killing. It becomes important, therefore, to state what circumstantial > evidence is; to point out the distinction between that and positive or > direct evidence; and to give you some idea of the mode in which a judicial > investigation is to be pursued by the aid of circumstantial evidence. The > distinction, then, between direct and circumstantial evidence, is this. > Direct or positive evidence is when a witness can be called to testify to > the precise fact which is the subject of the issue in trial; that is, in a > case of homicide, that the party accused did cause the death of the > deceased. Whatever may be the kind or force of the evidence, this is the > fact to be proved. ... Circumstantial evidence, therefore, is founded on > experience and observed facts and coincidences, establishing a connection > between the known and proved facts and the fact sought to be proved. The > advantages are, that, as the evidence commonly comes from several witnesses > and different sources, a chain of circumstances is less likely to be falsely > prepared and arranged, and falsehood and perjury are more likely to be > detected and fail of their purpose.Bemis, 463 Shaw further stated: > The evidence must establish the corpus delicti, as it is termed, or the > offence committed as charged; and, in case of homicide, must not only prove > a death by violence, but must, to a reasonable extent, exclude the > hypothesis of suicide, and a death by the act of any other person. This is > to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Then, what is reasonable doubt? It is > a term often used, probably pretty well understood, but not easily defined. > It is not mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs > and depending on moral evidence is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. > It is that state of the case, which, after the entire comparison and > consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of jurors in that > condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral > certainty, of the truth of the charge. The burden of proof is upon the > prosecutor.Bemis, 470 Sullivan makes the case in his book that Shaw overstepped his judicial bounds in his charge to the jury. Sullivan cites \\"Starkie, McNally, and Roscoe, the leading authorities upon the law of criminal evidence in 1850\\" and notes that they \\"made it quite clear that the fact of the corpus delicti, or the commission of the homicide, had to be proven by direct evidence to an absolute certainty, or beyond the least doubt. After this had been established absolutely, then the burden of proof was on the prosecution to show that the defendant had committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" \\"In his charge, however,\\" Sullivan notes that \\"Shaw set a new standard for the degree of proof required to show the commission of the homicide. He stated that the corpus delicti was to be proved \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" only, and then the guilt of the accused \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" also. He further instructed the jury that the corpus delicti could be established beyond a reasonable doubt by circumstantial evidence alone.\\"Sullivan, 144-145 The case against Webster was one of the first capital cases to be won by the prosecution without absolute evidence that the victim had been murdered. =Other noted cases= *The trial of anti-Catholic rioters who destroyed the Ursuline convent in Charlestown in Commonwealth v.

She died in 1822, leaving a son and a daughter, Elizabeth, who became the wife of author Herman Melville. (He was the nephew of Shaw's former fianc√©e and in 1847, the year of his marriage to Elizabeth, Melville dedicated his Polynesian novel, Typee, to Lemuel Shaw). On August 29, 1827, Shaw married Hope Savage, daughter of Dr. Samuel Savage of Barnstable; they had two sons. Widely read in English literature, Shaw was also attracted by new mechanical processes and was a member of many learned and charitable societies. He was a fellow of Harvard College from 1834 until his death, and an overseer from 1831 to 1853, two offices rarely united. Shaw was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1855.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Resignation and death After his resignation from the bench, his health failed, and he died within a few months.

Life Frewen was born at Northiam, in Sussex, the son of John Frewen who was the rector there. The unusual forename is an example of the type of puritan name not uncommon in the area in the late sixteenth century; his brother was called Thankful Frewen. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became a Fellow in 1612. Anthony Wood describes him as being at that time \\"puritanically enclin'd\\". In 1617 and 1621 the college allowed him to act as chaplain to Sir John Digby, ambassador in Spain. In Madrid he preached a sermon that pleased Prince Charles, afterwards Charles I, who, on his accession, appointed him one of his chaplains. In 1625 he became canon of Canterbury Cathedral and Vice-President of Magdalen College, and in the following year he was elected president. He was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in 1628 and 1629, and again in 1638 and 1639. In 1631 he was appointed (additionally) Dean of Gloucester. It was mainly by his instrumentality that the University plate was sent to the king at York in 1642. Two years later (in 1644) he was consecrated Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and resigned his presidency (and deanery). Parliament declared his estates forfeited for treason in 1652, and Cromwell afterwards set a price on his head. The proclamations, however, designated him Stephen Frewen, and he was consequently able to escape into France. At the Restoration he reappeared in public, and in 1660 he was consecrated Archbishop of York. In 1661 he acted as chairman of the Savoy conference.

It was formed by Aaron Weisburd, an American computer programmer from Illinois, in 2002, and became part of a collection of private anti-terrorist web monitoring companies, including \\"Terrorism Research Center\\", \\"Search for International Terrorist Entities Institute\\", and \\"Northeast Intelligence Network\\".

Haganah is also the name of the early Zionist militia originally formed to defend Jewish settlers in British Mandate Palestine, and which evolved into what is now the Israel Defense Forces. There are two main parts to Internet Haganah: # A small, global band of researchers, consultants, analysts and translators, who \\"associate and collaborate with each other as necessitated by our common desire to do more than just watch Islamists as they use the Internet.

Operation  The organization says it has taken down more than 1,000 Jihad sites. Their success logo is a blue drawing of an AK-47. To target websites perceived as threats, the organization relies upon its web community to find jihadists, and use a free \\"whois\\" service to determine if a US-based server hosts them. If so, as in the case of mawusat.com and its host Go Daddy, Internet Haganah operatives express concern about the nature of the site and ask the host to remove it. If this does not work and if the site concerns the US State Department's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, or the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, Internet Haganah contacts the banks and financiers of the host, who could face serious penalties for engaging in unreported transactions with the suspect website. If all else fails, the media may be contacted. However, their targets often find countermeasures against these actions. In the case of GoDaddy.com and mawusat.com, the site was attacked, but appeared on a different server within a week.

Nehamas has said, \\"The virtues of life are comparable to the virtues of good writing‚Äîstyle, connectedness, grace, elegance‚Äîand also, we must not forget, sometimes getting it right.\\"Carrier, David. \\"Alexander Nehamas\\", BOMB Magazine No. 65 (Fall, 1998).

This view also becomes evident in his book Only a Promise of Happiness. The title itself is later in this work used as one definition of beauty with reference to Stendhal. In that sense, beauty can be found in all media; as Nehamas claims in the same work: \\"Aesthetic features are everywhere, but that has nothing to do with where the arts can be found. Works of art can be beautiful because everything can be beautiful, but that doesn't mean that anything can be a work of art.\\" In 2016, Nehamas published a book, On Friendship, based on his 2008 Gifford Lectures.

He was the first, and remains the only known, U.S. Marine to command a U.S. Navy ship, commanding the prize ships Greenwich and during naval actions in the Pacific during the War of 1812. Biography Born in Brooklyn, New York, Gamble was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 16 January 1809 at the age of 17. Stationed in the South Sea in the Marine Detachment aboard the frigate USS Essex during the War of 1812, he rose to the rank of captain by June 1814. He distinguished himself in many enterprises, including encounters with people of the Marquesas Islands during the absence of USS Essex in 1813, and sailing a prize of Essex, the former whaler , with only a four-man crew and without benefit of a chart in a 17-day voyage to the Hawaiian Islands. Lieutenant Colonel Gamble is chiefly remembered in history as the only U.S. Marine to command a U.S. Navy ship, commanding two separate prize ships, the USS Greenwich and USS Sir Andrew Hammond, during the War of 1812: \\"...and, for want of sea officers, I placed Lieutenant Gamble of the Marines in charge of the Greenwich.\\" On or about 13 July 1813,Lieutenant Gamble's own memoirs recalled the actions on 12 July 1813, but Captain Porter's letters instead recalled 13 July 1813. while commanding the Greenwich, Lieutenant Gamble's capture of the British armed whaler after a sharp engagement was noted as a triumph by American newspapers and thus earned him considerable fame upon his return. Seringapatam was deemed the biggest British threat to American whalers in the South Pacific at the time. On 14 July 1813, Commodore Porter wrote of Lieutenant Gamble: \\"Allow me to return to you my thanks for your handsome conduct in bringing the Seringapatam to action, which greatly facilitated her capture, while it prevented the possibility of her escape. Be assured, sir, I shall make a suitable representation of the affair to the honorable Secretary of the Navy.\\" Later, Commodore Porter wrote a further communication to the Navy Department: \\"Captain Gamble at all times greatly distinguished himself by his activity in every enterprise engaged in by the force under my command, and in many critical encounters by the natives of Madison Island, rendered essential services, and at all times distinguished himself by his coolness and bravery. I therefore do, with pleasure, recommend him to the Department as an officer deserving of its patronage.\\" And again he wrote: \\"I now avail myself of the opportunity of assuring you that no Marine officer in the service ever had such strong claims as Captain Gamble, and that none have been placed in such conspicuous and critical situations, and that none could have extricated themselves from them more to their honor.\\" Porter's later decision to burn the Greenwich at Nuku Hiva also served to deprive the British of the valuable whale oil, then badly needed in England. However, during the Nuku Hiva Campaign, Lieutenant Gamble was again ordered by Commodore Porter to assume command of a prize ship, the Sir Andrew Hammond, and after the Seringapatam Mutiny, where the British prisoners successfully regained control over the Seringapatam and sailed to Australia, Gamble set out to sail the Sir Andrew Hammond with a skeleton crew to the Leeward Islands, but was intercepted en route. Gamble's subsequent capture by the British sloop , also served to protect the American whaling efforts in the region. Aboard Sir Andrew Hammond, Gamble was carrying gifts to be delivered as a tribute to the King of the Leeward Islands.The Hawaiian Islands. When these were taken by Captain Tucker of the Cherub as prizes of war, the diplomatic relations between the British and King of the Leeward Islands deteriorated. When American whalers were seen in the harbor, Captain Tucker demanded the native king turn both whalers and the stockpiled whale oil over to him. Tucker went so far as to threaten the King by landing his Royal Marines to change the King's mind. The good king firmly said, \\"No.\\" Tucker decided that a sloop's small complement of Marines and available firepower would be insufficient to force the issue, and thus sailed away. While promoted to his substantial majority only in July 1834‚Äîa full 21 years after his most famous action with the Seringapatam‚ÄîGamble was breveted a lieutenant colonel on 3 March 1827, which rank he held until his death.

Moving on to Vicksburg, he commanded a battery of heavy guns mounted on scows in exposed positions before the city, 19 June‚Äì4 July. After the capture of the river stronghold, he was given command of the 3d Division, Mississippi Squadron. During February and March 1864, he led expeditions up the Black and Ouachita Rivers and from mid-March to early May participated in Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter's expedition up the Red River. On 28 September, he was transferred to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in command of . He participated in the amphibious assaults on Fort Fisher 24 December 1864 and on 13 January 1865, and in subsequent attacks against Fort Anderson and other forts along the Cape Fear River. In April, he assisted in removing torpedoes (mines) from the James River and was present at the capture of Richmond. Post-Civil War service After the Civil War, Ramsay served in many and varied positions afloat; as Fleet Captain, South Atlantic Squadron and as commanding officer of , , , , and . Ashore, he served at the Naval Academy, at Newport, in London as naval attach√©, and at Boston and New York as commandant of the Navy Yards.

His 1953 book The Conservative Mind gave shape to the postwar conservative movement in the U.S. It traced the development of conservative thought in the Anglo-American tradition, giving special importance to the ideas of Edmund Burke. Kirk was considered the chief proponent of traditionalist conservatism. He was also an accomplished author of Gothic and ghost story fiction.  Life  Russell Kirk was born in Plymouth, Michigan. He was the son of Russell Andrew Kirk, a railroad engineer, and Marjorie Pierce Kirk. Kirk obtained his B.A. at Michigan State University and a M.A. at Duke University. During World War II, he served in the American armed forces and corresponded with a libertarian writer, Isabel Paterson, who helped to shape his early political thought. After reading Albert Jay Nock's book, Our Enemy, the State, he engaged in a similar correspondence with him. After the war, he attended the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. In 1953, he became the only American to be awarded the degree of Doctor of Letters by that university. Kirk \\"laid out a post- World War II program for conservatives by warning them, 'A handful of individuals, some of them quite unused to moral responsibilities on such a scale, made it their business to extirpate the populations of Nagasaki and Hiroshima; we must make it our business to curtail the possibility of such snap decisions.'\\"Polner, Murray (March 1, 2010) Left Behind, The American Conservative Upon completing his studies, Kirk took up an academic position at his alma mater, Michigan State. He resigned in 1959, after having become disenchanted with the rapid growth in student number and emphasis on intercollegiate athletics and technical training at the expense of the traditional liberal arts. Thereafter he referred to Michigan State as \\"Cow College\\" or \\"Behemoth University.\\" He later wrote that academic political scientists and sociologists were \\"as a breed‚Äîdull dogs\\".Kirk, Russell, ed., 1982. The Portable Conservative Reader. Viking: xxxviii. Late in life, he taught one semester a year at Hillsdale College, where he was Distinguished Visiting Professor of Humanities.Mary Catherine Meyer (February 25, 2016) Kirk should be on the Liberty Walk, The Hillsdale Collegian Kirk frequently published in two American conservative journals he helped found, National Review in 1955 and Modern Age in 1957. He was the founding editor of the latter, 1957‚Äì59. Later he was made a Distinguished Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, where he gave a number of lectures.Many published in his The Politics of Prudence (1993) and Redeeming the Time (1998). After leaving Michigan State, Kirk returned to his ancestral home in Mecosta, Michigan, where he wrote the many books, academic articles, lectures, and the syndicated newspaper column (which ran for 13 years) by which he exerted his influence on American politics and intellectual life. In 1963, Kirk converted to Catholicism and married Annette Courtemanche, now named Annette Kirk; they had four daughters. She and Kirk became known for their hospitality, welcoming many political, philosophical, and literary figures in their Mecosta house (known as \\"Piety Hill\\"), and giving shelter to political refugees, hoboes, and others. Their home became the site of a sort of seminar on conservative thought for university students. Piety Hill now houses the Russell Kirk Center for Cultural Renewal. After his conversion to Catholicism Kirk was a founding board member of Una Voce America. Kirk declined to drive, calling cars \\"mechanical Jacobins\\", and Kirk did not always maintain a stereotypically \\"conservative\\" voting record. \\"Faced with the non-choice between Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Thomas Dewey in 1944, Kirk said no to empire and voted for Norman Thomas, the Socialist Party candidate.\\"McCarthy, Daniel (October 12, 2012) How Does a Traditionalist Vote?, The American Conservative In the 1976 presidential election, he voted for Eugene McCarthy.Kauffman, Bill (May 19, 2008) When the Left Was Right, The American Conservative In 1992 he supported Pat Buchanan's primary challenge to incumbent George H. W. Bush, serving as state chair of the Buchanan campaign in Michigan. Kirk was a contributor to Chronicles. In 1989, he was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Ronald Reagan.  Ideas  = The Conservative Mind = The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Santayana,Which went into 7 editions, the later ones with the title The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot. Regnery Publishing. 7th edition (2001). the published version of Kirk's doctoral dissertation, contributed materially to the 20th century Burke revival. It also drew attention to: * Conservative statesmen such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Fisher Ames, George Canning, John C. Calhoun, John Randolph of Roanoke, Joseph de Maistre, Benjamin Disraeli, and Arthur Balfour; * The conservative implications of writings by well-known authors such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Scott, Alexis de Tocqueville, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Russell Lowell, George Gissing, George Santayana, Robert Frost, and T. S. Eliot; * British and American authors such as Fisher Ames, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, John Henry Newman, Walter Bagehot, Henry James Sumner Maine, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, Edwin Lawrence Godkin, William Hurrell Mallock, Leslie Stephen, Albert Venn Dicey, Robert Nisbet, Paul Elmer More, and Irving Babbitt. The Portable Conservative Reader (1982), which Kirk edited, contains sample writings by most of the above. Biographer Bradley J. Birzer argues that for all his importance in inspiring the modern conservative movement, not many of his followers agreed with his unusual approach to the history of conservatism. As summarized by reviewer Drew Maciag: :As Birzer's study demonstrates, Kirk's understanding of conservatism was so unique, idiosyncratic, transcendental, elitist, and in certain respects premodern and European, that it bore little resemblance to political conservatism in the United States. Conservative Mind successfully launched an intellectual challenge to postwar liberalism, but the variety of conservatism Kirk preferred found few takers, even within the American Right.Drew Maciag review of Bradley J. Birzer, Russell Kirk: American Conservatism (2015) in The Journal of American History 103#4 (March 2017) p. 1096. Harry Jaffa (a student of Leo Strauss) wrote: \\"Kirk was a poor Burke scholar. Burke's attack on metaphysical reasoning related only to modern philosophy's attempt to eliminate skeptical doubt from its premises and hence from its conclusions.\\" Russello (2004) argues that Kirk adapted what 19th-century American Catholic thinker Orestes Brownson called \\"territorial democracy\\" to articulate a version of federalism that was based on premises that differ in part from those of the Founders and other conservatives. Kirk further believed that territorial democracy could reconcile the tension between treating the states as mere provinces of the central government, and as autonomous political units independent of Washington. Finally, territorial democracy allowed Kirk to set out a theory of individual rights grounded in the particular historical circumstances of the United States, while rejecting a universal conception of such rights. In addition to bringing public attention to Anglo-American conservative principles, Kirk described his perception of liberal ideals in the first chapter. Kirk identified these ideals as the perfectibility of man, hostility towards tradition, rapid change in economic and political systems, and the secularization of government. = Principles = Kirk developed six \\"canons\\" of conservatism, which Russello (2004) described as follows: # A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, divine revelation, or natural law; # An affection for the \\"variety and mystery\\" of human existence; # A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize \\"natural\\" distinctions; # A belief that property and freedom are closely linked; # A faith in custom, convention, and prescription, and # A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence. Kirk said that Christianity and Western Civilization are \\"unimaginable apart from one another\\" and that \\"all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief.\\" = Kirk and libertarianism = Kirk grounded his Burkean conservatism in tradition, political philosophy, belles lettres, and the strong religious faith of his later years, rather than libertarianism and free market economic reasoning. The Conservative Mind hardly mentions economics at all. In a polemic, Kirk, quoting T. S. Eliot's expression, called libertarians \\"chirping sectaries,\\" adding that conservatives and libertarians share opposition to \\"collectivism,\\" \\"the totalist state,\\" and \\"bureaucracy,\\" but otherwise have \\"nothing\\" in common. He called the libertarian movement \\"an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating.\\" He said a line of division exists between believers in \\"some sort of transcendent moral order\\" and \\"utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct.\\" He included libertarians in the latter category. Kirk, therefore, questioned the \\"fusionism\\" between libertarians and traditional conservatives that marked much of post-World War II conservatism in the United States. However, Kirk's view of classical liberals is positive. He agrees with them on \\"ordered liberty\\" as they make \\"common cause with regular conservatives against the menace of democratic despotism and economic collectivism.\\". Tibor R. Machan defended libertarianism in response to Kirk's original Heritage Lecture. Machan argued that the right of individual sovereignty is perhaps most worthy of conserving from the American political heritage, and that when conservatives themselves talk about preserving some tradition, they cannot at the same time claim a disrespectful distrust of the individual human mind, of rationalism itself. Jacob G. Hornberger of the Future of Freedom Foundation also responded to Kirk. = Kirk and South Africa = In a column in The National Review on 9 March 1965 entitled \\"'One Man, One Vote' in South Africa,\\" Kirk wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court's jurisprudence on voting \\"will work mischief‚Äîmuch injuring, rather than fulfilling, the responsible democracy for which Tocqueville hoped,\\" but in the case of South Africa \\"this degradation of the democratic dogma, if applied, would bring anarchy and the collapse of civilization.\\"Kirk, Russell, \\"'One Man, One Vote' In South Africa,\\" National Review March 9, 1965, pg. 198 Kirk wrote that \\"the 'European' element [makes] South Africa the only 'modern' and prosperous African country.\\" He added that \\"Bantu political domination [of South Africa] would be domination by witch doctors (still numerous and powerful) and reckless demagogues\\" and that \\"Bantu and Coloreds and Indians must feel that they have some political voice in the South African commonwealth.\\" = Kirk and neoconservatism = Late in life, Kirk grew disenchanted with American neoconservatives as well. As Chronicles editor Scott Richert describes it: > [One line] helped define the emerging struggle between neoconservatives and > paleoconservatives. \\"Not seldom has it seemed,\\" Kirk declared, \\"as if some > eminent Neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United > States.\\" A few years later, in another Heritage Foundation speech, Kirk > repeated that line verbatim. In the wake of the Gulf War, which he had > opposed, he clearly understood that those words carried even greater > meaning. He also commented the neoconservatives were \\"often clever, never wise.\\" Midge Decter, Jewish director of the Committee for the Free World, called Kirk's remark \\"a bloody outrage, a piece of anti-Semitism by Kirk that impugns the loyalty of neoconservatives.\\"She claimed that Kirk \\"said people like my husband and me put the interest of Israel before the interest of the United States, that we have a dual loyalty.\\" Decter is the spouse of Norman Podhoretz. She told The New Republic, \\"It's this notion of a Christian civilization. You have to be part of it or you're not really fit to conserve anything. That's an old line and it's very ignorant.\\" Samuel T. Francis called Kirk's \\"Tel Aviv\\" remark \\"a wisecrack about the slavishly pro-Israel sympathies among neoconservatives.\\" He described Decter's response as untrue, \\"reckless\\" and \\"vitriolic.\\" Furthermore, he argued that such a denunciation \\"always plays into the hands of the left, which is then able to repeat the charges and claim conservative endorsement of them. = Kirk and the Gulf War = Toward the end of his life, Russell Kirk was highly critical of Republican militarism. President Bush, Kirk said, had embarked upon \\"a radical course of intervention in the region of the Persian Gulf\\".

Eliot's Moral Imagination in the Twentieth Century (1972), The Roots of American Order (1974), and the autobiographical Sword of the Imagination: Memoirs of a Half Century of Literary Conflict (1995). As was the case with his hero Edmund Burke, Kirk became renowned for the prose style of his intellectual and polemical writings.Nash (1998).  Fiction  Beyond his scholarly achievements, Kirk was talented both as an oral storyteller and as an author of genre fiction, most notably in his telling of consummate ghost stories in the classic tradition of Sheridan Le Fanu, M. R. James, Oliver Onions, and H. Russell Wakefield. He also wrote other admired and much-anthologized works that are variously classified as horror, fantasy, science fiction, and political satire. These earned him plaudits from fellow creative writers as varied and distinguished as T. S. Eliot, Robert Aickman, Madeleine L'Engle, and Ray Bradbury. Though modest in quantity‚Äîit encompasses three novels and 22 short stories‚ÄîKirk's body of fiction was written amid a busy career as prolific nonfiction writer, editor, and speaker. As with such other speculative fiction authors as G. K. Chesterton, C. S. Lewis, and J. R. R. Tolkien (all of whom likewise wrote only nonfiction for their \\"day jobs\\"), there are conservative undercurrents‚Äîsocial, cultural, religious, and political‚Äîto Kirk's fiction. Kirk stated in 1984 that the purpose of his stories as: > \\"The political ferocity of our age is sufficiently dismaying: men of letters > need not conjure up horrors worse than those suffered during the past decade > by the Cambodians and Ugandans, Afghans and Ethiopians. What I have > attempted, rather, are experiments in the moral imagination. Readers will > encounter elements of parable and fable...some clear premise is about the > character of human existence...a healthy concept of the character of > evil...\\" His first novel, Old House of Fear (1961, 1965), as with so many of his short stories, was written in a self-consciously Gothic vein. Here the plot is concerned with an American assigned by his employer to a bleak locale in rural Scotland‚Äîthe same country where Kirk had attended graduate school. This was Kirk's most commercially successful and critically acclaimed fictional work, doing much to sustain him financially in subsequent years. Old House of Fear was inspired by the novels of John Buchan and Kirk's own Scottish heritage. The story of Old House of Fear concerns an young American, Hugh Logan, a World War II veteran who is both brave and sensitive, sent to buy Carnglass, a remote island in the Hebrides. Upon reaching the island, he discovers that the island's owner, Lady MacAskival and her beautiful adopted daughter Mary are being held hostage by foreign spies, who are presumably working for the Soviet Union, out to sabotage a nearby NATO base. The leader of the spies is Dr. Jackman, an evil genius and nihilist intent upon wrecking destruction upon a world that failed to acknowledged his greatness and whom reviewers noted was a much more vividly drawn character than the hero Logan. Dr. Jackman appears to be a prototype of Kirk's best known character, Mandred Arcane, with the only difference being the former has no values while the latter does. Later novels were A Creature of the Twilight (1966), a dark comedy satirizing postcolonial African politics; and Lord of the Hollow Dark (1979, 1989), set in Scotland, which explores the great evil inhabiting a haunted house. A Creature of the Twilight concerns the adventures in Africa of a reactionary, romantic mercenary Mandred Arcane, a self-proclaimed mixture of Machiavelli and Sir Lancelot, who is an anachronistic survival of the Victorian Age who does not belong in the modern world and yet defiantly still exists, making him the \\"creature of the twilight\\". Kirk has Arcane write his pseudo-memoir in a consciously Victorian style to underline that he does not belong in the 1960s. Arcane is both a dapper intellectual and a hardened man of action, an elderly man full of an unnatural vigor, who is hired by the son of the assassinated Sultan to put down a Communist rebellion in the fictional African nation of Hamnegri, which he does despite overwhelming odds. In 1967, Kirk published a short story \\"Belgrummo's Hell\\" about a clever art thief who unwisely tries to rob the estate of the ancient Scottish warlock, Lord Belgrummo, who is later revealed to be Arcane's father. In another short story published in the same collection, \\"The Peculiar Demesne of Archvicar Gerontion\\" concerned a wizard, Archvicar Gerontion, who tries to kill Arcane by casting deadly spells. The Lord of the Hollow Dark is set at the same Belgrummo estate first encountered in \\"Belgrummo's Hell\\" where an evil cult led by the Aleister Crowley-like character Apollinax have assembled to secure for themselves the \\"Timeless Moment\\" of eternal sexual pleasure by sacrificing two innocents, an young woman named Marina and her infant daughter in an ancient warren called the Weem under the Belgrummo Estate. Assisting Apollinax is Archvicar Gerontion, who is really Arcane in disguise. Inspired by the novels of H.P. Lovecraft, Kirk in the Lord of the Hollow Dark has Arcane survive a \\"horrid chthonian pilgrimage\\" as he faces dark supernatural forces, confront his own family's history of evil, and refuse the appeal of a \\"seductive, hubristic immorality\\". The novel concludes with Arcane's own definition of a true \\"Timeless Moment\\" which he states: \\"it comes from faith, from hope, from charity; from having your work in the world; from the happiness of the people you love; or simply as a gift of grace\\". During his lifetime, Kirk also oversaw the publication of three collections which together encompassed all his short stories. (Three more such collections have been published posthumously, but those only reprint stories found in the earlier volumes.) Many of Kirk's short stories, especially the ghost stories, were set in either Scotland or in the rural parts of his home state of Michigan. Among his novels and stories, certain characters tend to recur, enriching the already considerable unity and resonance of his fictional canon. Though‚Äîthrough their themes and prose- style‚ÄîKirk's fiction and nonfiction works are complementary, many readers of the one have not known of his work in the other. Having begun to write fiction fairly early in his career, Kirk appears to have stopped after the early 1980s, while continuing his nonfiction writing and research through his last year of life.

Early work While time is a continuous quantity in both standard quantum mechanics and general relativity, many physicists have suggested that a discrete model of time might work, especially when considering the combination of quantum mechanics with general relativity to produce a theory of quantum gravity. The term was introduced in this sense by Robert L√©vi in 1927.L√©vi 1927 A quantum theory in which time is a quantum variable with a discrete spectrum, and which is nevertheless consistent with special relativity, was proposed by Chen Ning Yang in 1947.Yang 1947 Henry Margenau in 1950 suggested that the chronon might be the time for light to travel the classical radius of an electron.Margenau 1950 Work by Caldirola A prominent model was introduced by Piero Caldirola in 1980. In Caldirola's model, one chronon corresponds to about 6.27 seconds for an electron.Farias & Recami, p. 11. This is much longer than the Planck time, which is only about 5.39 seconds. The Planck time is a theoretical lower-bound on the length of time that could exist between two connected events, but it is not a quantization of time itself since there is no requirement that the time between two events be separated by a discrete number of Planck times. For example, ordered pairs of events (A, B) and (B, C) could each be separated by slightly more than 1 Planck time: this would produce a measurement limit of 1 Planck time between A and B or B and C, but a limit of 3 Planck times between A and C. Additionally, the Planck time is a universal quantization of time itself, whereas the chronon is a quantization of the evolution in a system along its world line. Consequently, the value of the chronon, like other quantized observables in quantum mechanics, is a function of the system under consideration, particularly its boundary conditions.Farias & Recami, p. 18. The value for the chronon, Œ∏0, is calculated asFarias & Recami, p. 11. Caldirola's original article has a different formula due to not working in standard units. : \\\\theta_0 = \\\\frac{1}{6\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0} \\\\frac{e^2}{m_0c^3}. From this formula, it can be seen that the nature of the moving particle being considered must be specified, since the value of the chronon depends on the particle's charge and mass. Caldirola claims that the chronon has important implications for quantum mechanics, in particular that it allows for a clear answer to the question of whether a free-falling charged particle does or does not emit radiation. This model supposedly avoids the difficulties met by Abraham‚ÄìLorentz's and Dirac's approaches to the problem and provides a natural explication of quantum decoherence.

Hirokazu Hamamura, an editor-in-chief (1992-2002), felt the beginning of a new era when he saw a private demonstration of Final Fantasy VII in 1993. He thought the name Famicom Ts≈´shin should be refurbished. At the start of 1996 (with issue #369) the magazines underwent another name change, truncating their titles to and The name Famits≈´ had already been in common use.

Incorporated by royal charter its mission is to promote the conditions in which businesses of all sizes and sectors in the UK can compete and prosper for the benefit of all. Its membership includes companies from the FTSE 100, mid-caps, SMEs, privately owned businesses, trade associations, universities and other public bodies. The CBI has members in many sectors: agriculture, automotive, aerospace, construction, creative, education, financial services, IT, manufacturing, professional services, retail, transport, tourism and utilities. Role The CBI works to promote business interests by lobbying and advising governments, networking with other businesses and creating intelligence through analysis of government policies and compilation of statistics, both in the United Kingdom and internationally through their offices in Beijing, Brussels, New Delhi and Washington, D.C. The organisation is non-partisan and has sought legal advice to ensure neutrality. Structure The present Director-General is Dame Carolyn Fairbairn who assumed the role in November 2015. The CBI is governed by its royal charter and by the CBI Council, which is able to delegate many of its roles to the Chairmen's Committee and Board. Final policy positions are mandated by the CBI Chairmen's Committee, which has a seat for all of the chairs of its regional and national councils and subject-based policy standing committees, Enterprise Forum and Trade Association Council. The Chairmen's Committee meets 4 times a year following each Standing Committee and Regional Council round.http://news.cbi.org.uk/about/how-we-work/ The CBI's strategic and financial decisions are decided on by the CBI Board, which is chaired by the CBI President and includes the support and guidance of 4 other non-executives. Day-to-day management of the CBI is in the hands of the Director-General supported by a Management Board, made up of a number of CBI directors. A President's Committee, made up of members, advises the president. The president, with the approval of the Chairmen's Committee (under its delegated powers), appoints the director-general, who is responsible for the management of the CBI. It has offices based in every region of the UK, including teams in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, along with offices in Washington D.C, New Delhi, Beijing and Brussels.http://news.cbi.org.uk/about/cbi- international/ In March 2014 it moved its headquarters from Centre Point, London, to offices in Cannon Place, above Cannon Street railway station in the City of London. History The organisation was formed in 1965 out of a merger of the Federation of British Industries (known as FBI), the British Employers' Confederation and the National Association of British Manufacturers. The CBI opened an office in Brussels in 1971, to open up opportunities in Europe. International Offices have opened in Washington (2002), Beijing (2005) and New Delhi (2011).  Research  The CBI conducts numerous surveys that are of particular use to its members and stakeholders. Research is available to the relevant sections of its membership. The CBI's surveys are currently: * Industrial Trends * Distributive Trends * Service Sector * Financial Sector * SME Trends * Investment Intentions Occasional surveys include: * Procurement * London Business * Education and Skills * Absence CBI policy is decided through consultation with its members ‚Äì companies from all sectors and sizes of business across the UK are directly involved in the policy-making process. The CBI publishes numerous reports each year on a wide range of issues that of interest and relevance to its members. Recent campaigns include \\"Future Champions\\", promoting the contribution and role of mid-sized businesses and \\"Industrial Futures\\", looking at how government should intervene in the economy to promote growth. The CBI publishes ‚ÄòBusiness Voice‚Äô, a monthly magazine for its membership and ‚ÄòIntelligence FIRST‚Äô, an occasional publication providing strategic guidance for members on regulatory and economic change.  The Great Business Debate  In September 2014, the CBI started The Great Business Debate campaign aimed at increasing public confidence in business. Survey data found that only around 50% of people in the UK think that business contributes positively to society and the campaign was initiated to play a part in increasing that figure. A website and social media channels have been set up to openly promote the contribution business makes whilst enabling people and organisations to give their opinions on this. It is planned that various events and other occurrences will take place across the UK as part of the campaign.  Scottish independence referendum controversy  In April 2014, the CBI registered with the Electoral Commission as a backer of the campaign against Scottish independence. As a result, 15 Scottish members (Scottish Enterprise, Visit Scotland, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, STV, the Law Society of Scotland, Aquamarine Power, Balhousie Care Group and the universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Strathclyde, Heriot Watt and Glasgow Caledonian) resigned from the organisation, while two others, Robert Gordon University and Dundee University, suspended their membership. The BBC announced on 24 April that it would also suspend its membership from 30 May until after the referendum on 18 September. On 25 April, the CBI announced it would try to nullify its registration. An Electoral Commission spokesman said: \\"We have received representations from the CBI to deregister. We are currently considering whether this is possible under the relevant legislation and will make our reasoning public when we have reached a conclusion and informed the CBI of our decision.\\" However, the chairman of Business for Scotland disputed this would be possible: \\"Our understanding is that the CBI cannot nullify its Electoral Commission registration and must, having been identified as a campaigning organisation, be policed by the Commission during the referendum campaign period, just as we are ourselves will be.\\" Organisation = Senior personnel = * Lord Karan Bilimoria CBE, DL, FCA, President * John Allan CBE, Vice President * Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General =Directors-general since 1965= * John Davies (30 July 1965 ‚Äì 15 October 1969) * Sir Campbell Adamson (15 October 1969 ‚Äì 2 July 1976) * Sir John Methven (2 July 1976 ‚Äì 23 April 1980) (died in office) * Sir Terence Beckett (1 October 1980 ‚Äì 26 March 1987) * Sir John Banham (26 March 1987 ‚Äì 26 June 1992) * Sir Howard Davies, (29 June 1992 ‚Äì 31 December 1995) * Adair Turner (1 January 1995 ‚Äì 31 December 2000) * Sir Digby Jones (1 January 2001 ‚Äì 30 June 2006) * Sir Richard Lambert (1 July 2006 ‚Äì 30 January 2011) * John Cridland (31 January 2011 ‚Äì October 2015) * Dame Carolyn Fairbairn (from November 2015 ) See also *British Chambers of Commerce *Federation of Small Businesses *TheCityUK References External links * *Catalogue of the CBI archives, held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick Category:Trade associations based in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1965 Category:Industry in the United Kingdom Category:1965 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Business organisations based in London ","title":"Confederation of British Industry"},{"id":"1165271","title":"The Red Shoes (album)"},{"id":"1165275","text":"Ostrakon of Cimon, an Athenian statesman, showing his name (as \\"Kimon [son] of Miltiades\\") Ostrakon of Megacles, son of Hippocrates (inscription: ŒúŒïŒìŒëŒöŒõŒïŒ£ ŒóŒôŒ†Œ†ŒüŒöŒ°ŒëŒ§ŒüŒ£), 487 BC. On display in the Ancient Agora Museum in Athens, housed in the Stoa of Attalus Voting ostraca (for ostracism, Ancient Greece) An ostracon (Greek: ostrakon, plural ostraka) is a piece of pottery, usually broken off from a vase or other earthenware vessel. In an archaeological or epigraphical context, ostraca refer to sherds or even small pieces of stone that have writing scratched into them. Usually these are considered to have been broken off before the writing was added; ancient people used the cheap, plentiful and durable broken pieces of pottery around them as convenient places to place writing for a wide variety of purposes, mostly very short inscriptions, but in some cases surprisingly long. Ostracism In Classical Athens, when the decision at hand was to banish or exile a certain member of society, citizen peers would cast their vote by writing the name of the person on the sherd of pottery; the vote was counted and, if unfavorable, the person was exiled for a period of ten years from the city, thus giving rise to the term ostracism. Egyptian limestone and potsherd ostraca vizier Khay copied onto a limestone ostracon, in Egyptian Hieratic The 251x251px Anything with a smooth surface could be used as a writing surface. Generally discarded material, ostraca were cheap, readily available and therefore frequently used for writings of an ephemeral nature such as messages, prescriptions, receipts, students' exercises and notes. Pottery sherds, limestone flakes,. and thin fragments of other stone types were used, but limestone sherds, being flaky and of a lighter colour, were most common. Ostraca were typically small, covered with just a few words or a small picture drawn in ink;. but the tomb of the craftsman Sennedjem at Deir el Medina contained an enormous ostracon inscribed with the Story of Sinuhe. The importance of ostraca for Egyptology is immense. The combination of their physical nature and the Egyptian climate have preserved texts, from the medical to the mundane, which in other cultures were lost.. These can often serve as better witnesses of everyday life than literary treatises preserved in libraries. =Deir el-Medina Medical Ostraca= The many ostraca found at Deir el-Medina provide a deeply compelling view into the medical workings of the New Kingdom. These ostraca have shown that, like other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care through a combination of medical treatment, prayer, and magic.. Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a ‚Äúphysician‚Äù who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a ‚Äúscorpion charmer‚Äù who specialized in magical cures for scorpion stings. The ostraca from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no ‚Äútrained‚Äù intermediary.Lesko, p. 68. Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, with only a handful of ostraca containing prescriptions, indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician‚Äôs prescription, or to fulfill a home remedy.. =Saqqara Dream Ostraca= From 1964‚Äì1971, Bryan Emery excavated at Saqqara in search of Imhotep's tomb; instead, the extensive catacombs of animal mummies were uncovered. Apparently it was a pilgrim site, with as many as 1¬Ω million ibis birds interred (as well as cats, dogs, rams, and lions). This 2nd-century BC site contained extensive pottery debris from the site offerings of the pilgrims. Emery's excavations uncovered the \\"Dream Ostraca\\", created by a scribe named Hor of Sebennytos. A devotee of the god Thoth, he lived adjacent to Thoth's sanctuary at the entrance to the North Catacomb and worked as a \\"proto-therapist\\", advising and comforting clients. He transferred his divinely-inspired dreams onto ostraca. The Dream Ostraca are 65 Demotic texts written on pottery and limestone.Reeves (2000). Biblical period ostraca Famous ostraca for Biblical archaeology have been found at: * Arad, Israel, or Tel Arad * Lachish * Mesad Hashavyahu * Ostraca House at Samaria * Elah Fortress at Khirbet Qeiyafa Additionally, the lots drawn at Masada are believed to have been ostraca, and some potsherds resembling the lots have been found. In October 2008, Israeli archaeologist, Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has discovered what he says to be the earliest known Hebrew text. This text was written on an Ostracon sherd; Garfinkel believes this sherd dates to the time of King David from the Old Testament, about 3,000 years ago. Carbon dating of the Ostracon and analysis of the pottery have dated the inscription to be about 1,000 years older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The inscription has yet to be deciphered, however, some words, such as king, slave and judge have been translated. The sherd was found about 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem at the Elah Fortress in Khirbet Qeiyafa, the earliest known fortified city of the biblical period of Israel.

Set in a courtroom during a murder trial, an unusual feature of the play is that members of the audience are chosen to play the jury. The court hears the case of Karen Andre, a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner, of whose murder she is accused. The play does not directly portray the events leading to Faulkner's death; instead the jury must rely on character testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty. The play's ending depends on the verdict. Rand's intention was to dramatize a conflict between individualism and conformity, with the jury's verdict revealing which viewpoint they preferred. The play was first produced in 1934 in Los Angeles under the title Woman on Trial; it received positive reviews and enjoyed moderate commercial success. Producer Al Woods took it to Broadway during the 1935‚Äì36 season and re-titled it Night of January 16th. It drew attention for its innovative audience-member jury and became a hit, running for seven months. Doris Nolan, in her Broadway debut, received positive reviews for her portrayal of the lead role. Several regional productions followed. An off-Broadway revival in 1973, under the title Penthouse Legend, was a commercial and critical failure. A film based on the play was released in 1941; the story has also been adapted for television and radio. Rand had many heated disputes with Woods over script changes he wanted for the Broadway production. Their disputes climaxed in an arbitration hearing when Rand discovered Woods had diverted a portion of her royalties to pay for a script doctor. Rand disliked the changes made for the Broadway production and the version published for amateur productions, so in 1968 she re-edited the script for publication as the \\"definitive\\" version. History =Background and first production= Rand drew inspiration for Night of January 16th from two sources. The first was The Trial of Mary Dugan, a 1927 melodrama about a showgirl prosecuted for killing her wealthy lover, which gave Rand the idea to write a play featuring a trial. Rand wanted her play's ending to depend on the result of the trial, rather than having a fixed final scene. She based her victim on Ivar Kreuger, a Swedish businessman known as the \\"Match King\\" for the matchstick-manufacturing monopolies he owned, before he was found dead in March 1932. When Kreuger's business empire became financially unstable, he shot himself after being accused of executing underhanded and possibly illegal financial deals. This incident inspired Rand to make the victim a businessman of great ambition and dubious character, who had given several people motives for his murder. Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933. She was 28 and had been in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her strong anti-Communist opinions had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' wardrobe department.; In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel, We the Living.; She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was trying to sell the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected.; Red Pawn was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down. E. E. Clive staged the play as Woman on Trial in 1934. Soon after she rejected the offer from Woods, Rand accepted an offer from Welsh actor E. E. Clive to stage the play in Los Angeles. It first opened at the Hollywood Playhouse as Woman on Trial; Clive produced, and Barbara Bedford played Andre. The production opened on October 22, 1934, and closed in late November. =Broadway production= At the end of the play's run in Los Angeles, Woods renewed his offer to produce the play on Broadway. Although he was a renowned producer of many famous plays in a career of more than three decades, Woods had lost much of his fortune in the early 1930s and had not produced a hit in several years. Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence. She reluctantly agreed to his terms. Rand arrived in New York City at the beginning of December 1934 in anticipation of the opening in January. The play's financing failed, delaying the production for several months until Woods arranged new financing from theater owner Lee Shubert. When work resumed, Rand's relationship with Woods quickly soured as he demanded changes she later derided as \\"a junk heap of worn, irrelevant melodramatic devices\\". Woods had made his success on Broadway with low-brow melodramas such as Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model and risqu√© comedies such as The Demi-Virgin. Woods was not interested in what he called Rand's \\"highfalutin speeches\\", preferring the dramatic conflict to focus on concrete elements, such as whether the defendant had a gun. The changes to Rand's work included the creation of a new character, a gun moll played by Shubert's mistress. The contract between Woods and Rand allowed him to hire collaborators if he thought it necessary, paying them a limited portion of the author's royalties. He first hired John Hayden to direct, paying him one percentage point from Rand's 10-percent royalty. Although Hayden was a successful Broadway director, Rand disliked him and later called him \\"a very ratty Broadway hanger-on\\". As auditions for the play began in Philadelphia, Woods demanded further script changes and was frustrated by Rand's refusal to make some of them. He engaged Louis Weitzenkorn, the author of the previous hit Five Star Final, to act as a script doctor. Rand's relationship with Weitzenkorn was worse than hers with Woods or Hayden; she and Weitzenkorn argued over political differences as well as his ideas for the play. Woods gave Weitzenkorn another percentage point from Rand's royalties without informing her. Rand filed a claim against Woods with the American Arbitration Association; she objected to Weitzenkorn receiving any portion of her royalties, and told the arbitration panel Weitzenkorn had added only a single line to the play, which was cut after the auditions. Upon hearing this testimony, one of the arbitrators responded incredulously, \\"That was he did?\\" In two hearings, the panel ruled that Weitzenkorn should receive his agreed- upon one percent, but that Woods could not deduct the payment from Rand's royalties because she had not been notified in advance. Despite the disputes between Rand and Woods, the play opened at Shubert's Ambassador Theatre on September 16, 1935, where it ran successfully for seven months. It closed on April 4, 1936, after 283 performances.; =Subsequent productions and publications= Producer Al Woods brought the play to Broadway in 1935. When the play's success on Broadway was clear, Woods launched productions of the play in other cities, starting with San Francisco. It opened there at the Geary Theater on December 30, 1935, and ran for five weeks with Nedda Harrigan in the lead role. Harrigan stayed with the show when it moved to the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, where it opened on March 1, 1936. After the Broadway production closed, Woods started a road tour that included productions in Boston and Chicago. International productions of the play included shows in London, Montreal, and Sydney. The production in London opened on September 29, 1936, where Phoebe Foster took the lead role for her first appearance on the London stage. It closed after 22 performances. A production in Montreal opened on June 16, 1941, starring Fay Wray as Andre and Robert Wilcox as Regan. In Sydney, the play opened at the Minerva Theatre on June 19, 1944, with Thelma Grigg as Andre. Night of January 16th was first published in an edition for amateur theater organizations in 1936, using a version edited by drama professor Nathaniel Edward , which included further changes to eliminate elements such as swearing and smoking. Rand disavowed this version because of the changes. In 1960, Rand's prot√©g√© Nathaniel Branden asked about doing a public reading of the play for students at the Nathaniel Branden Institute. Rand did not want him to use the amateur version; she created a revised text that eliminated most of Woods' and 's changes. She had her \\"final, definitive version\\" published in 1968 with an introduction about the play's history. In 1972, Rand approved an off-Broadway revival of the play, which used her preferred version of the script, including several dozen further small changes in language beyond those in the 1968 version. The revival also used her original title, Penthouse Legend. It was produced by Phillip and Kay Nolte Smith, a married couple who were friends with Rand. Kay Smith also starred in the production under the stage name Kay Gillian. It opened at the McAlpin Rooftop Theater on February 22, 1973, and closed on March 18 after 30 performances. Night of January 16th was the last theatrical success for either Rand or Woods. Rand's next play, Ideal, went unsold, and a 1940 stage adaptation of We the Living flopped. Rand achieved lasting success and financial stability with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. Woods produced several more plays; none were hits and when he died in 1951, he was bankrupt and living in a hotel. Synopsis The plot of Night of January 16th centers on the trial of secretary Karen Andre for the murder of her employer, business executive Bjorn Faulkner, who defrauded his company of millions of dollars to invest in the gold trade. In the wake of a financial crash, he was facing bankruptcy. The play's events occur entirely in a courtroom; Faulkner is never seen. On the night of January 16, Faulkner and Andre were in the penthouse of the Faulkner Building in New York City, when Faulkner apparently fell to his death. Within the three acts, the prosecutor Mr. Flint and Andre's defense attorney Mr. Stevens call witnesses whose testimonies build conflicting stories. At the beginning of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall that it was impossible to determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying. Doris Nolan played Karen Andre on Broadway. The second act continues the prosecution's case, with Flint calling John Graham Whitfield‚ÄîFaulkner's father-in-law and president of Whitfield National Bank. He testifies about a large loan he made to Faulkner. In his cross-examination, defense attorney Stevens suggests the loan was used to buy Faulkner's marriage to Whitfield's daughter. After this testimony, the prosecution rests and the defense argument begins. A handwriting expert testifies about the signature on the suicide note. Faulkner's bookkeeper describes events between Andre's dismissal and the night of Faulkner's death, and related financial matters. Andre takes the stand and describes her relationship with Faulkner as both his lover and his partner in financial fraud. She says she did not resent his marriage because it was a business deal to secure credit from the Whitfield Bank. As she starts to explain the reasons for Faulkner's alleged suicide, she is interrupted by the arrival of \\"Guts\\" Regan, an infamous gangster, who tells Andre that Faulkner is dead. Despite being on trial for Faulkner's murder, Andre is shocked by this news and faints. The final act continues Andre's testimony; she is now somber rather than defiant. She says that she, Faulkner, and Regan had conspired to fake Faulkner's suicide so they could escape with money stolen from Whitfield. Regan, who was also in love with Andre, provided the stolen body of his already-dead gang associate, \\"Lefty\\" O'Toole, to throw from the building. In cross-examination, Flint suggests Andre and Regan were using knowledge of past criminal activities to blackmail Faulkner. Stevens then calls Regan, who testifies that he was due to meet Faulkner at a getaway plane after leaving the stolen body with Andre; however, Faulkner did not arrive and the plane was missing. Instead of Faulkner, Regan encountered Whitfield, who gave him a check that was, according to Regan, to buy his silence. Regan later found the missing plane, which had been burned with what he presumes is Faulkner's body inside. Flint's cross-examination offers an alternative theory: Regan put the stolen body into the plane to create doubt about Andre's guilt, and the check from Whitfield was protection money to Regan's gang. In the play's Broadway and amateur versions, the next witness is Roberta Van Rensselaer, an exotic dancer and wife of O'Toole, who believes Regan killed her husband. This character does not appear in Rand's preferred version of the play. Stevens then recalls two witnesses to follow up on issues from Regan's testimony. The defense and prosecution then give their closing arguments. The jury retires to vote while the characters repeat highlights from their testimony under a spotlight. The jury then returns to announce its verdict. One of two short endings follows. If found not guilty, Andre thanks the jury. If found guilty, she says the jury have spared her from committing suicide. In Reeid's amateur version, after either verdict the judge berates the jurors for their bad judgment and declares that they cannot serve on a jury again. Title The play appeared as Woman on Trial at the Hollywood Playhouse. Although best known as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed multiple times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter.; Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date. When Rand published her version of the play in 1968, she wrote that although she disliked the Broadway title, it was too well known to change it again. She agreed to using Penthouse Legend as the title for the 1973 revival production. Broadway cast and characters The play's protagonist and lead female role is the defendant, Karen Andre. Woods considered several actresses for the role, but with Rand's support he cast an unusual choice, an actress named Doris Nolan. It was Nolan's Broadway debut; her previous professional acting experience was a failed attempt at completing a movie scene. At 17 years old, she was cast as a presumably older femme fatale. Woods was Nolan's manager and got a commission from her contract. Nolan was inexperienced and was nervous throughout rehearsals. When other actresses visited, she feared they were there to replace her. Although Rand later said she was \\"not a sensational actress\\", reviewers praised her performance. Nolan left the cast in March to take a movie contract from Universal Studios. Rand actively pushed for Walter Pidgeon to be cast in the role of \\"Guts\\" Regan. Woods objected at first, but eventually gave Pidgeon the part. As with Nolan, reviewers approved the choice. Pidgeon left the production after about a month to take a role in another play, There's Wisdom in Women.; Despite Rand's objections, he was replaced with William Bakewell; Rand recommended Morgan Conway, who played the same role in Woman on Trial.; Edmund Breese played District Attorney Flint in the Broadway production. Phoebe Foster appeared as Karen Andre in her London stage debut. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" + Cast of the Broadway production of Night of January 16th (in speaking order) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Character ! scope=\\"col\\"  Broadway cast ! scope=\\"col\\"  Other notable performers - ! scope=\\"row\\" Bailiff Donald Oliver  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Judge Heath J.

The selection of a jury from the play's audience was the primary dramatic innovation of Night of January 16th. It created concerns among many of the producers who considered and rejected the play. Although Woods liked the idea, Hayden worried it would destroy the theatrical illusion; he feared audience members might refuse to participate. Successful jury selections during previews indicated this would not be a problem. This criticism dissipated following the play's success; it became famous for its \\"jury gimmick\\". The play's jury has sometimes enlisted famous participants; the Broadway selections were rigged to call on celebrities known to be in the audience. The jury for the Broadway opening included attorney Edward J. Reilly‚Äîwho was known from the Lindbergh kidnapping trial earlier that year‚Äîand boxing champion Jack Dempsey. At a special performance for the blind, Helen Keller sat on the jury. The practice of using celebrity jurors continued throughout the Broadway run and in other productions. Woods decided the jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service rules of the New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the selected audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity. =Themes= Rand described Night of January 16th as \\"a sense-of-life play\\". She did not want its events to be taken literally, but to be understood as a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre \\"not guilty\\". She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint: \\"Your life, your achievement, your happiness, are of paramount importance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is man's most admirable quality\\". She said the play \\"is not a philosophical treatise on morality\\" and represents this view only in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called \\"Objectivism\\", particularly in her 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged and in non-fiction essays, but Night of January 16th predates these more philosophical works. Several later commentators have interpreted the play as a reflection of Rand's early interest in the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Literature professor Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche's morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner, who \\"never thought of things as right or wrong\\". Others found significance in Rand's admiration of the play's criminal characters. Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand \\"found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism\\" because of the influence on her of \\"Nietzsche's transvaluation of values [that] changed criminals into heroes\\". Rand maintained criminality was not the important attribute of the characters; she said a criminal could serve as \\"an eloquent symbol\\" of independence and rebellion against conformity, but stated, \\"I do not think, nor did I think when I wrote this play, that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain\\". Rand biographer Ronald Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover-up for the play's promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected. He called the play \\"a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview\\" of the superiority of the \\"superman\\"; this is represented by Faulkner, whom Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the \\"slave morality\\" of ordinary people. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand \\"later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals\\", making the characters' criminality an embarrassment for her. Reception Walter Pidgeon received positive reviews for playing \\"Guts\\" Regan in the Broadway production. Since its premiere, Night of January 16th has had a mixed reception. The initial Los Angeles run as Woman on Trial received complimentary reviews; Rand was disappointed that reviews focused on the play's melodrama and its similarity to The Trial of Mary Dugan, while paying little attention to aspects she considered more important, such as the contrasting ideas of individualism and conformity. Although Rand later described the production as \\"badly handicapped by lack of funds\\" and \\"competent, but somewhat unexciting\\", it performed reasonably well at the box office during its short run. The Broadway production received largely positive reviews that praised its melodrama and the acting of Nolan and Pidgeon. Commonweal described it as \\"well constructed, well enough written, admirably directed ... and excellently acted\\". The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said the action came in \\"fits and starts\\", but praised the acting and the novelty of the use of a jury. New York Post critic John Mason Brown said the play had some flaws, but was an exciting, above-average melodrama. Brooks Atkinson gave it a negative review in The New York Times, calling it \\"the usual brew of hokum\\". A review from Theatre Arts Monthly was also dismissive, calling the play a \\"fashionable game\\" that would be \\"fun in a parlor\\" but seemed \\"pretty foolish\\" on stage. Some reviews focused on Woods as the source of the play's positive attributes because he had had many previous theatrical successes. Time said Woods was repeating a successful formula from The Trial of Mary Dugan. Reviews that praised these elements were an embarrassment to Rand, who considered Woods' changes to be negative. Again, reviewers ignored the broader themes that Rand considered important. Professional productions in other North American cities typically received positive reviews. Austin B. Fenger described the production at San Francisco's Geary Theater as \\"darned good theater\\" that was \\"well acted\\" and \\"crisply written\\". Charles Collins said the Chicago production was \\"a first class story\\" that was \\"well acted by an admirably selected cast\\". Thomas Archer's review of the Montreal production described it as \\"realistic\\" and \\"absorbing\\". The London production in 1936 received mostly positive reviews but was not a commercial success. A reviewer for The Times praised Foster's performance as \\"tense and beautiful\\". In The Daily Telegraph, reviewer W. A. Darlington said the show would be popular with audiences, but the production ended its run in less than a month. The review in The Glasgow Herald described it as a \\"strong, quick thriller\\", but with inferior dialog to The Trial of Mary Dugan. The reviewer for The Spectator was more critical, saying the play itself was \\"strong\\", but was undermined by \\"mediocre playing\\" from \\"bad actors\\". The 1973 revival as Penthouse Legend was a failure and received strongly negative reviews. A reviewer for The Village Voice complimented the story's melodramatic plot twists but said it was \\"preposterously badly written\\" and described the production as \\"conventional and obvious\\". In The New York Times, Clive Barnes called the play tedious and said the acting was \\"not particularly good\\". It closed within a few weeks. Academics and biographers reviewing the play have also expressed mixed opinions. Theater scholar Gerald Bordman declared it \\"an unexceptional courtroom drama\\" made popular by the jury element, although he noted praise for the acting of Breese and Pidgeon. Historian James Baker described Rand's presentation of courtroom behavior as unrealistic, but said audiences forgive this because the play's dramatic moments are \\"so much fun\\". He said the play was \\"great entertainment\\" that is \\"held together by an enormously attractive woman and a gimmick\\", but \\"it is not philosophy\\" and fails to convey the themes Rand had in mind. Jennifer Burns expressed a similar view, stating that the play's attempts to portray individualism had \\"dubious results ... Rand intended Bjorn Faulkner to embody heroic individualism, but in the play he comes off as little more than an unscrupulous businessman with a taste for rough sex\\". Literature scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein described the play as \\"significant for dramatic ingenuity and thematic content\\". Rand biographer Anne Heller considered it \\"engaging, if stilted\\", while Ronald Merrill described it as \\"a skillfully constructed drama\\" undercut by \\"Rand's peculiar inability to write an effective mystery plot without leaving holes\\". Mystery critic Marvin Lachman noted the novelty of the use of a jury but called the play unrealistic with \\"stilted dialogue\\" and \\"stereotypical characters\\". Adaptations =Movies= The movie rights to Night of January 16th were initially purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in October 1934 as a possible vehicle for Loretta Young. They hired Rand to write a screenplay, but the project was scrapped. After MGM's option expired, Woods considered making a movie version through a production company of his own, but in 1938 RKO Pictures bought the rights for $10,000, a fee split between Woods and Rand. RKO considered Claudette Colbert and Lucille Ball as possible stars, but they also gave up on the adaptation. The rights were resold to Paramount Pictures in July 1939 for $35,000. Paramount released a movie in 1941; Rand did not participate in the production. The film was directed by William Clemens, and Delmer Daves, Robert Pirosh, and Eve Greene were engaged to prepare a new screenplay. The new screenplay altered the plot significantly, focusing on Steve Van Ruyle (Robert Preston), a sailor who inherits a position on the board of a company headed by Bjorn Faulkner (Nils Asther). Unlike the play, in which Faulkner is already dead, he appears in the film as a living character who is apparently murdered. Suspicion falls on Faulkner's secretary Kit Lane (Ellen Drew); Van Ruyle decides to investigate the alleged crime. Faulkner is discovered hiding in Cuba after faking his own death. Rand said only a single line from her original dialog appeared in the movie, which she dismissed as a \\"cheap, trashy vulgarity\\". The film received little attention when it was released, and most reviews of it were negative. In 1989, Gawaahi, a Hindi- language adaptation of Night of January 16th was released. Indian actress Zeenat Aman led a cast that included Shekhar Kapur and Ashutosh Gowariker. =Television and radio= Night of January 16th was adapted for several television anthology series in the 1950s and 1960s. The first was WOR-TV's Broadway Television Theatre, which aired its adaptation on July 14, 1952, with a cast that included Neil Hamilton and Virginia Gilmore. On CBS, the Lux Video Theatre presented a version of Night of January 16th on May 10, 1956, starring Phyllis Thaxter as Andre. In the United Kingdom, Maxine Audley took the lead role for an ITV Play of the Week broadcast on January 12, 1960; Cec Linder played the district attorney. The broadcast had been scheduled for October 6, 1959, but was delayed to avoid its possible interpretation as political commentary before the general election held later that week. A radio adaptation of the play was broadcast on the BBC Home Service on August 4, 1962.

Biography Astley was born on 12 June 1947 to Edwin Astley (1922‚Äì98) and Hazel Balbirnie in Grappenhall, Cheshire. Edwin was a television writer and composer, known for his work on The Saint and The Danger Man. By coincidence, he had often opened for Townshend's father Cliff's band, The Squadronaires. Karen is the eldest daughter and has four siblings: Jon, Gareth, Alison and Virginia. In the 1960s Astley was educated at Ealing Art College where she studied dress design (textiles). There she met musician and songwriter Pete Townshend who later joined the British band the Who. Astley owned a small boutique named \\"Hem & Fringe\\" with two college friends, Angela Brown and Annie Dupe√®. On 20 May 1968, aged 20, Astley married Townshend at Didcot Registry Office. Their first daughter, Emma, was born on 28 March 1969, followed by Aminta on 24 April 1971 and Joseph in 1989.

Established in 1969 and based initially on the personal collection of Rochester native Margaret Woodbury Strong, the Museum opened to the public in 1982, after several years of planning, cataloguing, and exhibition development for the Museum's new building in downtown Rochester. For at least fifteen years after its opened, the mission of the Museum was to interpret the social and cultural history of average Americans between 1830 and 1940, under the direction of H.J. Swinney and William T. Alderson. Mrs. Strong's collections of dolls and toys, American and European decorative arts, prints, paintings, Japanese crafts, and advertising ephemera provided a firm foundation for this mission, and were supplemented with collections purchased and donated to more fully support the Museum's early mission. The Museum received considerable local and national publicity and support and substantial financial support from the National Endowment for the Humanities' Exhibitions and Public Programs division. In the 1990s, the Museum's Board of Trustees and Director changed the Museum's mission to collecting, preserving, and interpreting the history of play. Since then it has refined and increased its collections (hundreds of thousands of items), and expanded twice, in 1997 and 2006.Adams, Rollie G. \\"Ready, Set, Go: Finally a Museum of Play.\\" History News 61, no. 3.

This function was intended to be installed on the then-current Windows 95 operating system. It was also included in Windows 98 and later Windows operating systems up through 32-bit XP, but was absent from XP Professional x64 Edition (for AMD64) and all subsequent versions of Windows. Its status on XP 64-bit edition (for Itanium) and on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Server 2003 is not widely known. This corresponded to version Internet Explorer 4.0 to 6.x, but not Internet Explorer 7. HTML could be added both in place of the regular wallpaper and as independent resizable desktop items. Items available on-line could be regularly updated and synchronized so users could stay updated without visiting the website in their browser. Active Desktop worked much like desktop widget technology in that it allowed users to place customized information on their desktop. History The introduction of the Active Desktop marked Microsoft's attempt to capitalize on the push technology trend led by PointCast. Active Desktop placed a number of \\"channels\\" on the user's computer desktop that provided continually-updated information, such as news headlines and stock quotes, without requiring the user to open a Web browser. However, its most notable feature was that it allowed MJPGs and animated GIFs to animate correctly when set as the desktop wallpaper. Active Desktop debuted as part of an Internet Explorer 4.0 preview release in July 1997, and came out with the launch of the 4.0 browser in September that year. for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, as a feature of the optional Windows Desktop Update offered to users during the upgrade installation. While the Windows Desktop Update is commonly referred to (improperly) as Active Desktop itself, it is actually an entire Windows shell upgrade from v4.0 to v4.71, or v4.72, with numerous changes to the Windows interface, resulting in an appearance and functionality level nearly indistinguishable from the then yet-to-be-released Windows 98. Features include the option to allow uppercase filenames (the old v4.0 desktop would forcibly display uppercase filenames in title case), configurable one-click hot-tracking file selection, customizable per-folder HTML display settings, QuickLaunch mini-buttons on the Taskbar next to the Start button, upgraded Start Menu allowing drag and drop item reordering and allowing right-click context menus for item renaming, etc. With the update, Windows Explorer featured an Address bar in which Internet addresses can be entered and seamlessly browsed. Active Desktop never attained any significant degree of popularity, as its drawbacks included high use of system resources and reduction in system stability. The component was retained in Windows XP but was replaced by a feature named Windows Sidebar in Windows Vista. Sidebar in turn was called Windows Desktop Gadgets in Windows 7, which also allows components to be added to the desktop, but it was also discontinued due to security issues; Windows 8 replaced it with live tiles in the Start screen. Windows Server 2003 R2 32-bit is the most recent Microsoft operating system to support Active Desktop. It appears that the 64-bit version of Windows XP no longer supports Active Desktop. However, it still provides the option to display Web pages and channels built with Microsoft's Channel Definition Format (CDF) on the desktop. The HTML displaying capabilities are now mainly used for creating original wallpapers and adding search boxes to the desktop.

Early in his career he was also billed as Frank A. Connor and Frank L.A. O'Connor. During the silent film era, he directed or was the assistant director on numerous films; he also penned several screenplays in both the silent and sound film eras. He is sometimes erroneously identified with the Frank O'Connor who was married to author Ayn Rand. Life and career Born on April 11, 1881, in New York City, O'Connor would begin his film career with a starring role in the 1915 silent film, The Voice in the Fog, which also starred Donald Brian and Adda Gleason. He starred or had featured roles in six more films between 1917 and 1920, before focusing on work behind the camera. During the remainder of the silent film era, he would write and/or direct over two dozen films, May McAvoy (several films, including Everything for Sale, 1921), Ralph Lewis (several films, including One of the Bravest, 1925), Clara Bow (several films, including Free To Love, 1925), Owen Moore (Go Straight, 1925), Jean Arthur (The Block Signal, 1926, which O'Connor also wrote), Gayne Whitman (Exclusive Rights, 1926), Wanda Hawley (Hearts and Spangles, 1926), Madge Bellamy (Colleen, 1927), Phyllis Haver (Your Wife and Mine, 1927), and Betty Compson (Masked Angel, 1928). He also wrote four screenplays for silent films during the 1920s. With the advent of sound in films, O'Connor would once again move in front of the camera. After 1930 he would only direct 2 sound films, The Call of the Circus in 1930, starring Francis X. Bushman, and 1939's The Mystic Circle Murder, which starred Robert Fiske and Betty Compson, and which O'Connor also wrote. He would write the story for Sailor Be Good (1933), directed by James Cruze and starring Jack Oakie, as well as Adventure in Diamonds, directed by George Fitzmaurice and starring George Brent and Isa Miranda. From 1930 right up to the year of his death in 1959, O'Connor would appear in over 600 films, serials, shorts, and television shows, mostly in small roles. Some of the more notable films he appeared in include: the original King Kong (1933), starring Fay Wray, as well as its sequel, The Son of Kong, also in 1933; 1935's The Little Colonel, starring Shirley Temple and Lionel Barrymore; John Ford's The Whole Town's Talking, starring Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur; the 1937 version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; Frank Capra's classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, again with Jean Arthur, also starring James Stewart and Claude Rains; John Ford's classic The Grapes of Wrath, adapted from the novel of the same name by John Steinbeck, and starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell; the iconic Citizen Kane, directed by and starring Orson Welles; Cover Girl (1944) starring Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly; Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1947), starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed; the 1950 John Wayne vehicle, Sands of Iwo Jima (1950); Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. (1950), starring William Holden and Gloria Swanson; and the 1955 version of My Sister Eileen starring Janet Leigh, Jack Lemmon, and Betty Garrett. One of his final big screen performances would be in another small role in 1957's Jet Pilot, starring John Wayne and Janet Leigh. In addition to his feature film work, O'Connor would appear in several serials, including G-Men Never Forget in 1948, Superman in 1948, Ghost of Zorro (1949), Batman and Robin (1949), King of the Rocket Men (1949), The Invisible Monster (1950), Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), and Captain Video: Master of the Stratosphere (1951). With the advent of television, O'Connor would make numerous appearances on the small screen. His first appearance was in a 1952 episode of Racket Squad. Other series on which he appeared include: Dragnet, Adventures of Superman, and Perry Mason. His final performance would be on a 1959 episode of M Squad, which aired on April 17, shortly before his death. O'Connor died on November 22, 1959, at the age of 77, in Los Angeles, California.

It serves as the Central Business District for the Redcliffe Peninsula and its surrounding suburbs. = Climate = History Portwood Estate map, 1878, showing the Redcliffe railway line and railway station Before European settlement, the Redcliffe Peninsula was occupied by the indigenous Ningy Ningy people. The native name is Kau-in-Kau- in, which means Blood-Blood (red-like blood). The town's name originates from \\"Red Cliff Point\\" named by the explorer Matthew Flinders, referring to the red cliffs at Woody Point. Redcliffe became Queensland's first colony in 1824; however, it was soon abandoned for Brisbane. Redcliffe holds the distinction of being the first European settlement in Queensland, first visited by Matthew Flinders on 17 July 1799. Explorer John Oxley recommended \\"Red Cliff Point\\" ‚Äì named after the red-coloured cliffs visible from Moreton Bay ‚Äì to the Governor Thomas Brisbane for the new Moreton Bay penal colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore. The penal colony was established at Redcliffe on 13 September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers, some with wives and children, and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after one year and the colony was moved south to a site on the Brisbane River at North Quay, south, that offered a more reliable water supply. This settlement lead to the establishment of Brisbane, now Queensland's capital city. Crowds at the beach, 1937 Redcliffe became a pastoral district in the 1860s and in the 1880s boomed as a seaside resort town. In 1878, a suburban subdivision called Portwood Estate (around the present day Portwood Street, Sheehan Street, and Sylvin Street) was offered for sale, with the lots described as \\"large, elevated, picturesque, salubrious, with rare perspective\\" in Humpy Bong which was to be \\"the fashionable watering place of the future!\\". The estate map shows the Redcliffe railway line terminating at a railway station just to the north-east of the estate (in the area of present day Macnaughton Street). However, the Redcliffe Peninsula railway line was not opened until October 2016 (138 years later) and the terminus was located in neighbouring Kippa-Ring.Beachside path, 1906 In October 1881, approximately 60 allotments of \\"Ramsgate Estate\\" were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Arthur Martin & Co, being subdivisions 1 to 60, of portion 205 in the Parish of Redcliffe. From 1911 the twin screw excursion steamer Koopa made regular trips to Redcliffe jetty. The principal route for passengers was a steamer from Sandgate pier to Woody Point Pier. The Hornibrook Bridge connecting Clontarf in the Town of Redcliffe to Brighton in City of Brisbane was completed in 1935 and allowed easy access to and from Brisbane by motor car leading the way to rapid suburban development. That led to the cessation of the Sandgate to Woody Point steamers. A famous Ningy Ningy Bora ring structure, consisting of two separate rings, large and small, joined by a ritual pathway, once existed between Kippa Ring and Anzac Avenue. Aboriginals as far away as Noosa would travel there to perform initiation ceremonies. It was razed by the Council around 1950. In 1958, the Gibb family from Manchester, England emigrated to this area and called it home for a period. Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb went on to form the highly successful music group, The Bee Gees. In 1959, Brisbane based Speedcar driver Bill Goode, the promoter of the Redcliffe Speedway (located at the Redcliffe Showgrounds) hired the brothers to entertain the crowds at the speedway from the back of a truck during the interval. This was the first ever public performance by the trio. In a letter to the Redcliffe Museum in 1999, Barry Gibb wrote \\"The smell of the oil, the noise and the atmosphere was incredible. This was the first public appearance Robin, Maurice and I ever made in Australia. We sang through the PA system and people threw money onto the track, and we met Brisbane's leading DJ and racing car driver Bill Gates, who suggested we call ourselves the BG's and even played our songs on his radio show, \\"Swinging' Gates' Platter Chatter\\". Hence Redcliffe became the birthplace of the Bee Gees.\\" The former Redcliffe Town Council Chambers, 2016 The first high-rise apartment building was constructed along Marine Parade in 1974. For decades the interest for similar development was limited ‚Äì until 2000 there were only four apartment buildings higher than 6 stories across the entire Peninsula. Renewed interest in Redcliffe as a seaside lifestyle precinct occurred in the 2000s and 2010s and as a result high rise and mix use development is found in all areas of Redcliffe along the coastline. In 1975, the toll on the Hornibrook Highway was removed. The current Redcliffe Library opened in 2000. In the 2011 census, the population of Redcliffe was 9,201; 52% female and 48% male.  Heritage listings  Redcliffe has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Anzac Memorial Avenue * 395 Oxley Avenue: Redcliffe Fire Station * 133-137 Redcliffe Parade: Comino's Arcade * 185 Redcliffe Parade: former Redcliffe Town Council Chambers Attractions and features Settlement Cove Lagoon, 2016 Suttons Beach Redcliffe Jetty Attractions such as Suttons Beach(location of Luna Park Redcliffe (1944 to 1966)Redcliffe Historical Timeline ‚Äì Moreton Bay Regional Council), Redcliffe Jetty, Settlement Cove Lagoon, Redcliffe Museum, Redcliffe Botanic Gardens and Redcliffe Showgrounds are all within the suburb of Redcliffe. The entire Redcliffe Parade precinct is home to an abundance of restaurants and eateries including the award- winning Rustic Olive Italian restaurant and the Mon Komo hotel. On Sundays, the Redcliffe Markets take place along Redcliffe Parade and in recent years have been a significant event for local businesses with crowds of thousands taking part. Aside from smaller events, in September each year, Redcliffe celebrates its history as Queensland's first European settlement location with the Redcliffe festival event. This festival is chiefly held in the Redcliffe CBD with Redcliffe Parade being closed off to traffic for most of the day. Other attractions as part of this festival include the KiteFest, The Jetty Fiesta, KiteFest Live and Spring Break Beach Party with ongoing interest from local community groups and sponsors to create larger and more attractive events each year. A statue and walkway in honour of the Bee Gees was unveiled by Barry Gibb on 14 February 2013. Barry returned to open the second stage of the walkway on 9 September 2015. The Moreton Bay Regional Council operates a public library at 476 Oxley Avenue. Education * Southern Cross Catholic College * Redcliffe State High School opened in 1958 * Redcliffe Special School opened in 1964  Sport and recreation  A number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area. Some of them are the well known Sandgate-Redcliffe Gators, Redcliffe Dolphins, Redcliffe Tigers, Peninsula Power FC and Redcliffe Padres. Redcliffe hosts the only harness racing in Queensland that is North of Brisbane at the Redcliffe Harness Racing & Sporting Club.  Transport  Redcliffe is served by a small general aviation airfield, Redcliffe Airport , located northwest of Redcliffe in the suburb of Rothwell. A few bus lines operate in Redcliffe and are run by Translink. Demographics In the 2011 census, the population of Redcliffe was 9,201; 52% female and 48% male. The median age of the Redcliffe population was 44 years of age, 7 years above the Australian median. Children aged under 15 years made up 15.5% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 20.7% of the population. 68.4% of people living in Redcliffe were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 7%, New Zealand 6.3%, Scotland 1%, Philippines 0.8%, Netherlands 0.7%. 86.8% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 0.5% Italian, 0.4% Tagalog, 0.4% German, 0.3% Dutch, 0.3% Samoan.

The evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism.\\" and is driven by a small group of proponents. ‚Äî Barbara Forrest, 2005, testifying in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial.  * *  Purpose  The overall goal of the intelligent design movement is to overthrow materialism and atheism. Its proponents believe that society has suffered \\"devastating\\" cultural consequences from adopting materialism and that science is the cause of the decay into materialism because it seeks only natural explanations, and is therefore atheistic. They believe that the scientific theory of evolution implies that humans have no spiritual nature, no moral purpose, and no intrinsic meaning. They seek to \\"reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview\\", represented by the theory of evolution, in favor of \\"a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.\\" To achieve their goal of defeating a materialistic world view, advocates of intelligent design take a two-pronged approach. Alongside the promotion of intelligent design, proponents also seek to \\"Teach the Controversy\\"; discredit evolution by emphasizing perceived flaws in the theory of evolution, or disagreements within the scientific community and encourage teachers and students to explore non-scientific alternatives to evolution, or to critically analyze evolution and the controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution. But the world's largest general scientific society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has stated that \\"There is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of evolution.\\" and that \\"Evolution is one of the most robust and widely accepted principles of modern science.\\" The ruling in the 2005 Dover, Pennsylvania, trial, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a United States federal court, stated that \\"evolution, including common descent and natural selection, is 'overwhelmingly accepted' by the scientific community.\\" Whether ID is Science, p. 70 Whether ID is Science, p. 83 The Discovery Institute (DI) is a religious think tank that drives the intelligent design movement.Attie, et al. 2006 The Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC) counts most of the leading intelligent design advocates among its membership, most notably its program advisor Phillip E. Johnson. Johnson is the architect of the movement's key strategies, the wedge strategy and the \\"Teach the Controversy\\" campaign. The Discovery Institute and leading proponents represent intelligent design as a revolutionary scientific theory.Dembski 2004 The overwhelming majority of the scientific community, as represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of SciencesNational Academy of Sciences 1999, p. 25 and nearly all scientific professional organizations, firmly reject these claims, and insist that intelligent design is not valid science, its proponents having failed to conduct an actual scientific research program. This has led the movement's critics to state that intelligent design is merely a public relations campaign and a political campaign. According to critics of the intelligent design movement, the movement's purpose is political rather than scientific or educational. They claim the movement's \\"activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it.\\" Intelligent design is an attempt to recast religious dogma in an effort to reintroduce the teaching of biblical creationism to public school science classrooms; the intelligent design movement is an effort to reshape American society into a theocracy, primarily through education. As evidence, critics cite the Discovery Institute's political activities, its wedge strategy and statements made by leading intelligent design proponents. The scientific community's position, as represented by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), is that intelligent design is not science, but creationist pseudoscience. Richard Dawkins, a biologist and professor at Oxford University, compares the intelligent design movement's demand to \\"teach the controversy\\" with the demand to teach flat Earthism; acceptable in terms of history, but not in terms of science. \\"If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science--one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat--you are misleading children.\\"  Philosophy  At the 1999 \\"Reclaiming America for Christ Conference\\" called by Reverend D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, Phillip E. Johnson gave a speech called \\"How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won.\\" In it he sums up the theological and epistemological underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for victory:  History of the movement  The intelligent design movement grew out of a creationist tradition which argues against evolutionary theory from a religious standpoint, usually that of evangelical or fundamentalistic Christianity. Although intelligent design advocates often claim that they are arguing only for the existence of a designer who may or may not be God, all the movement's leading advocates believe that this designer is God. They frequently accompany their arguments with a discussion of religious issues, especially when addressing religious audiences, but elsewhere downplay the religious aspects of their agenda. = Origins = The modern use of the words \\"intelligent design,\\" as a term intended to describe a field of inquiry, began after the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Edwards v. Aguillard (1987), ruled that creationism is unconstitutional in public school science curricula. A Discovery Institute report says that Charles Thaxton, editor of Of Pandas and People, had picked the phrase up from a NASA scientist, and thought \\"That's just what I need, it's a good engineering term.\\" In drafts of the book over one hundred uses of the root word \\"creation,\\" such as \\"creationism\\" and \\"creation science,\\" were changed, almost without exception, to \\"intelligent design,\\" Context, pp. 31‚Äì33. while \\"creationists\\" was changed to \\"design proponents\\" or, in one instance, \\"cdesign proponentsists.\\" * In 1989, Of Pandas and People was published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), with the definition: Pandas was followed in 1991 by Darwin on Trial, a neo-creationist polemic by Phillip E. Johnson, that is regarded as a central text of the movement.Stewart 2007, p. 2 Darwin on Trial mentioned Pandas as \\"'creationist' only in the sense that it juxtaposes a paradigm of 'intelligent design' with the dominant paradigm of (naturalistic) evolution,\\" but his use of the term as a focus for his wedge strategy promoting \\"theistic realism\\" came later.Johnson 2010, pp. 238‚Äì239 Article reprinted in full by Access Research Network here. The book was reviewed by evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould for Scientific American in July 1992, concluding that the book contains \\"...no weighing of evidence, no careful reading of literature on all sides, no full citation of sources (the book does not even contain a bibliography) and occasional use of scientific literature only to score rhetorical points.\\" Gould's review led to the formation in 1992 or 1993 of an 'Ad Hoc Origins Committee' of Johnson's supporters, which wrote a letter, circulated to thousands of university professors, defending the book. Among the 39 signatories were nine who later became members of the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC).Forrest & Gross 2004, p. 18 During the early 1990s Johnson worked to develop a 'big tent' movement to unify a wide range of creationist viewpoints in opposition to evolution. In 1992, the first formal meeting devoted to intelligent design was held in Southern Methodist University. It included a debate between Johnson and Michael Ruse (a key witness in McLean v. Arkansas (1982)) and papers by William A. Dembski, Michael Behe and Stephen C. Meyer. In 1993, Johnson organized a follow-up meeting, including Dembski, Behe, Meyer, Dean H. Kenyon (co-author of Pandas) and Walter Bradley (co-author with Thaxton and Kenyon of The Mystery of Life's Origin (1984)), as well as two graduate students, Paul A. Nelson and Jonathan Wells.Numbers 2006, p. 380 = Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture = On December 6, 1993, an article by Meyer was published in The Wall Street Journal, drawing national attention to the controversy over Dean H. Kenyon's teaching of creationism. This article also gained the attention of Discovery Institute co-founder Bruce Chapman. On discovering that Meyer was developing the idea of starting a scientific research center in conversations with conservative political scientist John G. West, Chapman invited them to create a unit within the Discovery Institute called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (later renamed the Center for Science and Culture). This center was dedicated to overthrowing \\"scientific materialism\\" and \\"fomenting nothing less than a scientific and cultural revolution.\\"Numbers 2006, pp. 381‚Äì382 A 1995 conference, \\"The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture,\\" served as a blueprint for the center.Forrest & Gross 2004, p. 19 By 1996 they had nearly a million dollars in grants, the largest being from Howard Ahmanson, Jr., with smaller but still large contributions coming from the Stewardship Foundation established by C. Davis Weyerhaeuser and the Maclellan Foundation, and appointed their first class of research fellows. = The wedge strategy = The wedge strategy was formulated by Phillip E. Johnson to combat the \\"evil\\" of methodological naturalism.Numbers 2006, p. 377 It first came to the general public's attention when a Discovery Institute internal memo now known as the \\"Wedge Document\\" (believed to have been written in 1998) was leaked to the public in 1999. However it is believed to have been an update of an earlier document to be implemented between 1996 and 2001.Forrest & Gross 2004, pp. 25‚Äì29 The document begins with \\"The proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built.\\" and then goes on to outline the movement's goal to exploit perceived discrepancies within evolutionary theory in order to discredit evolution and scientific materialism in general. Much of the strategy is directed toward the broader public, as opposed to the professional scientific community. The stated \\"governing goals\\" of the CSC's wedge strategy are: :1. To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies :2. To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God Critics of intelligent design movement argue that the Wedge Document and strategy demonstrate that the intelligent design movement is motivated purely by religion and political ideology and that the Discovery Institute as a matter of policy obfuscates its agenda. The Discovery Institute's official response was to characterize the criticism and concern as \\"irrelevant,\\" \\"paranoid,\\" and \\"near-panic\\" while portraying the Wedge Document as a \\"fund-raising document.\\" Johnson in his 1997 book Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds confirmed some of the concerns voiced by the movement's gainsayers: = Kansas evolution hearings = The Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, from May 5 to May 12, 2005, by the Kansas State Board of Education and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were arranged by the conservative Board with the intent of introducing intelligent design into science classes via the \\"Teach the Controversy\\" method. The hearings raised the issues of creation and evolution in public education and were attended by all the major participants in the intelligent design movement but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is purportedly the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities. The Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board. Local science advocacy group Kansas Citizens for Science organized a boycott of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings. * Board member Kathy Martin declared at the beginning of the hearings \\"Evolution has been proven false. ID (Intelligent Design) is science-based and strong in facts.\\" At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is \\"an unproven, often disproven\\" theory. \\"ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic,\\" asserted Martin. The scientific community rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the National Academy of Sciences, which issued a policy statement saying \\"Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science.\\" On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. = Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (2005) = In the movement's sole major case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, it was represented by the Thomas More Law Center, which had been seeking a test-case on the issue for at least five years. However conflicting agendas resulted in the withdrawal of a number of Discovery Institute Fellows as expert witnesses, at the request of DI director Bruce Chapman, and mutual recriminations with the DI after the case was lost. The Alliance Defense Fund briefly represented the Foundation for Thought and Ethics in its unsuccessful motion to intervene in this case, and prepared amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the DI and FTE in it. Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District It has also made amicus curiae submissions and offered to pay for litigation, in other (actual and potential) creationism-related cases. On a far smaller scale, Larry Caldwell and his wife operate under the name Quality Science Education for All, and have made a number of lawsuits in furtherance of the movement's anti-evolution agenda. In 2005 they brought at least three separate lawsuits to further the intelligent design movement's agenda. One was later abandoned, two were dismissed.  Reception by the scientific community  Intelligent design advocates realize that their arguments have little chance of acceptance within the mainstream scientific community, so they direct them toward politicians, philosophers and the general public. What prima facie \\"scientific\\" material they have produced has been attacked by critics as containing factual misrepresentation and misleading, rhetorical and equivocal terminology. A number of documentaries that promote their assertion that intelligent design as an increasingly well- supported line of scientific inquiry have been made for the Discovery Institute. The bulk of the material produced by the intelligent design movement, however, is not intended to be scientific but rather to promote its social and political aims. Whether ID is Science, p. 89 Disclaimer, p. 49 Polls indicate that intelligent design's main appeal to citizens comes from its link to religious concepts. An August 2005 poll from The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life showed 64% of Americans favoring the teaching of creationism along with evolution in science classrooms, though only 38% favored teaching it instead of evolution, with the results varying deeply by education level and religiosity. The poll showed the educated were far less attached to intelligent design than the less educated. Evangelicals and fundamentalists showed high rates of affiliation with intelligent design while other religious persons and the secular were much lower. Scientists responding to a poll overwhelmingly said intelligent design is about religion, not science. A 2002 sampling of 460 Ohio science professors had 91% say it's primarily religion, 93% say there is not \\"any scientifically valid evidence or an alternate scientific theory that challenges the fundamental principles of the theory of evolution,\\" and 97% say that they did not use intelligent design concepts in their own research. In October and November 2001, the Discovery Institute advertised A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism in three national publications (The New York Review of Books, The New Republic and The Weekly Standard), listing what they claimed were \\"100 scientific dissenters\\" who had signed a statement that \\"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\\" Shortly afterwards the National Center for Science Education described the wording as misleading, noting that a minority of the signatories were biologists and some of the others were engineers, mathematicians and philosophers, and that some signatories did not fully support the Discovery Institute's claims. The list was further criticized in a February 2006 article in The New York Times which pointed out that only 25% of the signatories by then were biologists and that signatories' \\"doubts about evolution grew out of their religious beliefs.\\" In 2003, as a humorous parody of such listings the NCSE produced the pro-evolution Project Steve list of signatories, all with variations of the name Steve and most of whom are trained biologists. As of July 31, 2006, the Discovery Institute lists \\"over 600 scientists,\\" while Project Steve reported 749 signatories; as of May 30, 2014, 1,338 Steves have signed the statement, while 906 have signed A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism as of April 2014.  Structure  = The 'big tent' strategy = The movement's strategy as set forth by Phillip E. Johnson states the replacement of \\"materialist science\\" with \\"theistic science\\" as its primary goal; and, more generally, for intelligent design to become \\"the dominant perspective in science\\" and to \\"permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life.\\" This agenda is now being actively pursued by the Center for Science and Culture, which plays the leading role in the promotion of intelligent design. Its fellows include most of the leading intelligent design advocates: William A. Dembski, Michael Behe, Jonathan Wells and Stephen C. Meyer. Intelligent design has been described by its proponents as a 'big tent' belief, one in which all theists united by having some kind of creationist belief (but of differing opinions as regards details) can support. If successfully promoted, it would reinstate creationism in the teaching of science, after which debates regarding details could resume. In his 2002 article in Christian Research Journal, Discovery Institute fellow Paul A. Nelson credits Johnson for the 'big tent' approach and for reviving creationist debate since the Edwards v. Aguillard decision. According to Nelson, \\"The promise of the big tent of ID is to provide a setting where Christians (and others) may disagree amicably, and fruitfully, about how best to understand the natural world, as well as Scripture.\\" In his presentation to the 1999 \\"Reclaiming America for Christ Conference,\\" \\"How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won,\\" Johnson affirmed this 'big tent' role for \\"The Wedge\\" (without using the term intelligent design): The Discovery Institute consistently denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda has religious foundations, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when World News Tonight asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the Institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying \\"I don't think we want to go down that path.\\" = Obfuscation of religious motivation = Phillip E. Johnson, largely regarded as the leader of the movement, positions himself as a \\"theistic realist\\" against \\"methodological naturalism\\" and intelligent design as the method through which God created life.Johnson 1995, pp. 208-209. \\"A theistic realist assumes that the universe and all its creatures were brought into existence for a purpose by God. Theistic realists expect this 'fact' of creation to have empirical, observable consequences that are different from the consequences one would observe if the universe were the product of nonrational causes... God always has the option of working through regular secondary mechanisms, and we observe such mechanisms frequently. On the other hand, many important questions‚Äîincluding the origin of genetic information and human consciousness‚Äîmay not be explicable in terms of unintelligent causes, just as a computer or a book cannot be explained that way.\\" Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design recognized \\"as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message.\\" Hence intelligent design arguments are carefully formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of theistic creationism is a necessary first step for ultimately introducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson emphasizes \\"the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion\\" and that \\"after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact\\" only then can \\"biblical issues\\" be discussed. In the foreword to Creation, Evolution, & Modern Science (2000) Johnson writes \\"The intelligent design movement starts with the recognition that 'In the beginning was the Word,' and 'In the beginning God created.' Establishing that point isn't enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message.\\"Bohlin 2000, p. 5 = Organizations =  The Center for Science and Culture  The Center for Science and Culture, formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, is a division of the Discovery Institute. The Center consists of a tightly knit core of people who have worked together for almost a decade to advance intelligent design as both a concept and a movement as necessary adjuncts of its wedge strategy policy. This cadre includes Phillip E. Johnson, Michael Behe, William A. Dembski and Stephen C. Meyer. They are united by a religious vision which, although it varies among the members in its particulars and is seldom acknowledged outside of the Christian press, is predicated on the shared conviction that America is in need of \\"renewal\\" which can be accomplished only by unseating \\"Godless\\" materialism and instituting religion as its cultural foundation. In his keynote address at the \\"Research and Progress in intelligent design\\" (RAPID) conference held in 2002 at Biola University, William A. Dembski described intelligent design's \\"dual role as a constructive scientific project and as a means for cultural renaissance.\\" In a similar vein, the movement's hub, the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture had until 2002 been the \\"Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture.\\" Explaining the name change, a spokesperson for the CSC insisted that the old name was simply too long. However, the change followed accusations that the center's real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians. Critics of the movement cite the Wedge Document as confirmation of this criticism and assert that the movement's leaders, particularly Phillip E. Johnson, view the subject as a culture war: \\"Darwinian evolution is not primarily important as a scientific theory but as a culturally dominant creation story. ... When there is radical disagreement in a commonwealth about the creation story, the stage is set for intense conflict, the kind of conflict that is known as a 'culture war.'\\"Johnson 1995, pp. 12‚Äì13 Recently the Center for Science and Culture's has moderated its previous overtly theistic mission statements to appeal to a broader, a more secular audience. It hopes to accomplish this by using less overtly theistic messages and language. Despite this, the Center for Science and Culture still states as a goal a redefinition of science, and the philosophy on which it is based, particularly the exclusion of what it calls the \\"unscientific principle of materialism,\\" and in particular the acceptance of what it calls \\"the scientific theory of intelligent design.\\" Promotional materials from the Discovery Institute acknowledge that the Ahmanson family donated $1.5 million to the Center for Science and Culture, then known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, for a research and publicity program to \\"unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism's cultural legacy.\\" Mr. Ahmanson funds many causes important to the Christian religious right, including Christian Reconstructionism, whose goal is to place the US \\"under the control of biblical law.\\" Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian Reconstructionist Chalcedon Foundation.  Other organizations  *The Access Research Network (ARN) has become a comprehensive clearinghouse for ID resources, including news releases, publications, multimedia products and an elementary school science curriculum. Its stated mission is \\"providing accessible information on science, technology and society issues from an intelligent design perspective.\\"Forrest & Gross 2004, pp. 165-167 Its directors are Dennis Wagner and CSC Fellows Mark Hartwig, Stephen C. Meyer and Paul A. Nelson. Its 'Friends of ARN' is also dominated by CSC Fellows. *The Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE) is a Christian non- profit organization based in Richardson, Texas, that publishes textbooks and articles promoting intelligent design, abstinence, and Christian nationism. CSC Fellows Charles Thaxton and WIliam A. Dembski have served as academic editors for the Foundation. * The FTE has close associations with the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement and other religious Christian groups. *The Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center (IDEA Center) is a Christian nonprofit organization formed originally as a student club promoting intelligent design at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). There are about 25 active chapters of the organization in the United States, Kenya, Canada, Ukraine, and the Philippines. There have been 35 active chapters formed and several others are currently pending. Six out of the listed 32 chapters in the United States are located at high schools. In December 2008, biologist Allen MacNeill stated, on the basis of analysis of the webpages of the national organization and local chapters, that it appeared that the organization is moribund. *The Intelligent Design Network (IDnet) is a nonprofit organization formed in Kansas to promote intelligent design. It is based in Shawnee Mission, Kansas. The Intelligent Design Network was founded by John Calvert, a corporate finance lawyer with a bachelor's degree in geology and nutritionist William S. Harris. Together, Calvert and Harris have published the article in The National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly. Calvert also has written a play about intelligent design in a high school biology class with Daniel Schwabauer.  Activism  The intelligent design movement primarily campaigns on two fronts: a public relations campaign meant to influence the popular media and sway public opinion; and an aggressive lobbying campaign to cultivate support for the teaching of intelligent design amongst policymakers and the wider educational community. Both these activities are largely funded and directed by the Discovery Institute, from national to grassroots levels. The movement's first goal is to establish an acceptance of intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science; its long-term goal is no less than the \\"renewal\\" of American culture through the shaping of public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. As the Discovery Institute states, intelligent design is central to this agenda: \\"Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.\\" The Discovery Institute has also relied on several polls to indicate the acceptance of intelligent design. A 2005 Harris poll identified ten percent of adults in the United States as taking what they called the intelligent design position, that \\"human beings are so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them.\\" (64% agreed with the creationist view that \\"human beings were created directly by God\\" and 22% believed that \\"human beings evolved from earlier species.\\" 49% accepted plant and animal evolution, while 45% did not.) Although some polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls have been criticized as suffering from considerable flaws, such as having a low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading questions. Critics of intelligent design and its movement contend that intelligent design is a specific form of creationism, neo-creationism, a viewpoint rejected by intelligent design advocates. It was bolstered by the 2005 ruling in United States federal court that a public school district requirement for science classes to teach that intelligent design is an alternative to evolution was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, United States District Judge John E. Jones III also ruled that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature. In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts. Testimony, Aralene Callahan, September 27, 2005 Testimony, Julie Smith, September 28, 2005 Responding to the well-organized curricular challenges of intelligent design proponents to local school boards have been disruptive and divisive in the communities where they've taken place. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly and divert scarce funds away from education into court battles. Although these court battles have almost invariably resulted in the defeat of intelligent design proponents, they are draining and divisive to local schools. For example, as a result of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of teaching the controversy - presenting intelligent design as an allegedly scientific alternative to evolution. Leading members of the intelligent design movement are also associated with denialism, both Phillip E. Johnson and Jonathan Wells have signed an AIDS denialism petition. Wells' \\"personal peculiarities include membership in the Moonies and support for AIDS reappraisal - the theory that the HIV is not the primary cause of AIDS.\\" = Campaigns = The Discovery Institute, through its Center for Science and Culture, has formulated a number of campaigns to promote intelligent design, while discrediting evolutionary biology, which the Institute terms \\"Darwinism.\\" Prominent Institute campaigns have been to \\"Teach the Controversy\\" and, more recently, to allow Critical Analysis of Evolution. Other prominent campaigns have claimed that intelligent design advocates (most notably Richard Sternberg) have been discriminated against, and thus that Academic Freedom bills are needed to protect academics' and teachers' ability to criticise evolution, and that there is a link from evolution to ideologies such as Nazism and eugenics. These three claims are all publicised in the pro-ID movie Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed (2008). Other campaigns have included petitions, most notably A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism. The response of the scientific community has been to reiterate that the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of scientific consensus \\"...While 99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution, 40 to 50 percent of college students do not accept evolution and believe it to be 'just' a theory.\\" ‚Äî Brian Alters whereas intelligent design has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of the scientific community (see list of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design). = Politics and public education = The main battlefield for this culture war has been US regional and state school boards. Courts have also become involved as those campaigns to include intelligent design or weaken the teaching of evolution in public school science curricula are challenged on First Amendment grounds. In Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, the plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Intelligent design is an integral part of a political campaign by cultural conservatives, largely from evangelical religious convictions, that seek to redefine science to suit their own ideological agenda. Though numerically a minority of Americans,. the politics of intelligent design is based less on numbers than on intensive mobilization of ideologically committed followers and savvy public relations campaigns. * Wilgoren 2005 Political repercussions from the culturally conservative sponsorship of the issue has been divisive and costly to the effected communities, polarizing and dividing not only those directly charged with educating young people but entire local communities. With a doctrine that calls itself science among non-scientists but is rejected by the vast majority of the real practitioners, an amicable coexistence and collaboration between intelligent design advocates and upholders of mainstream science education standards is rare. With mainstream scientific and educational organizations saying the theory of evolution is not \\"in crisis\\" or a subject doubted by scientists, nor intelligent design the emergent scientific paradigm or rival theory its proponents proclaim, \\"teaching the controversy\\" is suitable for classes on politics, history, culture, or theology they say, but not science. By attempting to force the issue into science classrooms, intelligent design proponents create a charged environment that forces participants and bystanders alike to declare their positions, which has resulted in intelligent design groups threatening and isolating high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts. 6:Curriculum, Conclusion, pp. 129‚Äì130. \\"Moreover, Board members and teachers opposing the curriculum change and its implementation have been confronted directly. First, Casey Brown testified that following her opposition to the curriculum change on October 18, 2004, Buckingham called her an atheist and Bonsell told her that she would go to hell. Second, Angie Yingling was coerced into voting for the curriculum change by Board members accusing her of being an atheist and un- Christian. In addition, both Bryan Rehm and Fred Callahan have been confronted in similarly hostile ways, as have teachers in the DASD.\\" In a round table discussion entitled \\"Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design?\\" at the American Enterprise Institute on 21 October 2005 and televised on C-SPAN, the Discovery Institute's Mark Ryland and the Thomas More Law Center's Richard Thompson had a frank disagreement, in which Ryland claimed the Discovery Institute has always cautioned against the teaching of intelligent design, and Thompson responded that the Institute's leadership had not only advocated the teaching of intelligent design, but encouraged others to do so, and that the Dover Area School District had merely followed the Institute's calls for action. As evidence, Thompson cited the Discovery Institute's guidebook Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula written by the Institute's co- founder and first director, Stephen C. Meyer, and David K. DeWolf, a CSC Fellow, which stated in its closing paragraphs: \\"Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution -- and this includes the use of textbooks such as Of Pandas and People that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design.\\"DeWolf, Meyer, & DeForrest 1999 = Higher education = In 1999, William A. Dembski was invited by Baylor University president Robert B. Sloan to form the Michael Polanyi Center, described by Dembski as \\"the first Intelligent Design think tank at a research university.\\" Its creation was controversial with Baylor faculty, and in 2000 it was merged with the Institute for Faith and Learning. Dembski, although remaining as a research professor until 2005, was given no courses to teach.Phy-Olsen 2010, pp. 70‚Äì71 Two universities have offered courses in intelligent design: Oklahoma Baptist University, where ID advocate Michael Newton Keas taught 'Unified Studies: Introduction to Biology,' and Biola University, host of the Mere Creation conference.Forrest & Gross 2004, p. 165 Additionally, numerous Christian evangelical institutions have faculty with interests in intelligent design. These include Oral Roberts University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Patrick Henry College teaches creationism but also exposes its students to both Darwinian evolution and intelligent design. Edition 10.2.4. In 2005, the American Association of University Professors issued a strongly worded statement asserting that the theory of evolution is nearly universally accepted in the community of scholars, and deploring requirements \\"to make students aware of an 'intelligent-design hypothesis' to account for the origins of life.\\" It said that such requirements are \\"inimical to principles of academic freedom.\\" = The Web = Much of the actual debate over intelligent design between intelligent design proponents and members of the scientific community has taken place on the Web, primarily blogs and message boards, instead of the scientific journals and symposia where traditionally much science is discussed and settled. In promoting intelligent design the actions of its proponents have been more like a political pressure group than like researchers entering an academic debate as described by movement critic Taner Edis.Young & Edis 2004 The movement lacks any verifiable scientific research program and concomitant debates in academic circles. The Web continues to play a central role in the Discovery Institute's strategy of promotion of intelligent design and it adjunct campaigns. On September 6, 2006, on the Center's Evolution News & Views blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post entitled \\"Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries.\\" In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that Wikipedia's coverage of ID to be \\"one sided\\" and that pro- intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published a Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers \\"to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design.\\" = International = Despite being primarily based in the United States, there have been efforts to introduce pro-intelligent design teaching material into educational facilities in other countries. In the United Kingdom, the group Truth in Science has used material from the Discovery Institute to create free teaching packs which have been mass-mailed to all UK schools. Shortly after this emerged, government ministers announced that they regarded intelligent design to be creationism and unsuitable for teaching in the classroom. They also announced that the teaching of the material in science classes was to be prohibited.  Criticisms of the movement  One of the most common criticisms of the movement and its leadership is that of intellectual dishonesty, in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence. It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Critics of the movement, such as Eugenie Scott, Robert T. Pennock and Barbara Forrest, claim that leaders of the intelligent design movement, and the Discovery Institute in particular, knowingly misquote scientists and other experts, deceptively omit contextual text through ellipsis, and make unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials. Theologian and molecular biophysicist Alister McGrath has a number of criticisms of the Intelligent design movement, stating that \\"those who adopt this approach make Christianity deeply... vulnerable to scientific progress\\" and defining it as just another \\"god-of-the-gaps\\" theory. He went on to criticize the movement on theological grounds as well, stating \\"It is not an approach I accept, either on scientific or theological grounds.\\"McGrath & McGrath 2007, p. 30 Such statements commonly note the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory's PhD or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the University of Texas, Ohio University, and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: Probe Ministries for Bohlin, Reasons to Believe ministry for Rana, and the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture for Wells. Similarly confusing lists of local scientists were circulated during controversies over evolution education in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas. In another instance, the Discovery Institute frequently mentions the Nobel Prize in connection with Henry F. Schaefer, III, a CSC Fellow, and chemist at the University of Georgia. Critics allege that Discovery Institute is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a \\"five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize\\" because Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years. This criticism is not reserved only to the Institute; individual intelligent design proponents have been accused of using their own credentials and those of others in a misleading or confusing fashion. For example, critics allege William A. Dembski gratuitously invokes his laurels by boasting of his correspondence with a Nobel laureate, bragging that one of his books was published in a series whose editors include a Nobel laureate, and exulting that the publisher of the intelligent design book The Mystery of Life's Origin, Philosophical Library, also published books by eight Nobel laureates. Critics claim that Dembski purposefully omits relevant facts which he fails to mention to his audience that in 1986, during the Edwards v. Aguillard hearings, 72 Nobel laureates endorsed an amicus curiae brief that noted that the \\"evolutionary history of organisms has been as extensively tested and as thoroughly corroborated as any biological concept.\\" Another common criticism is that since no intelligent design research has been published in mainstream, peer-reviewed scientific journals, the Discovery Institute often misuses the work of mainstream scientists by putting out lists of articles that allegedly support their arguments for intelligent design drawing from mainstream scientific literature. Often, the original authors respond that their articles cited by the center don't support their arguments at all. Many times, the original authors have publicly refuted them for distorting the meaning of something they've written for their own purposes. Sahotra Sarkar, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas, has testified that intelligent design advocates, and specifically the Discovery Institute, have misused his work by misrepresenting its conclusions to bolster their own claims, has gone on to allege that the extent of the misrepresentations rises to the level of professional malfeasance: An October 2005 conference called \\"When Christians and Cultures Clash\\" was held in Christ Hall at Evangelical School of Theology in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Attorney Randall L. Wenger, who is affiliated with the Alliance Defense Fund, and a close ally of the Discovery Institute, and one of the presenters at the conference advocated the use of subterfuge for advancing the movement's religious goals: \\"But even with God's blessing, it's helpful to consult a lawyer before joining the battle... For instance, the Dover area school board might have had a better case for the intelligent design disclaimer they inserted into high school biology classes had they not mentioned a religious motivation at their meetings... Give us a call before you do something controversial like that... I think we need to do a better job at being clever as serpents.\\"  See also  *Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed * Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center * Intelligent design in politics * Intelligent design network *Kitzmiller v.

The first roller skate was effectively an ice skate with wheels replacing the blade. Later the \\"quad\\" style of roller skate became more popular consisting of four wheels arranged in the same configuration as a typical car. Roller skating is a hobby, sport, and mode of transportation using roller skates.  History  A pair of roller skates within the permanent collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Skates like these fit over shoes and were adjustable. While the first reported use of roller skates was on a London stage in 1743, the first patented roller skate was introduced in 1760 by Belgian inventor John Joseph Merlin. His roller skate wasn't much more than an ice skate with wheels where the blade goes, a style we would call inline today. They were hard to steer and hard to stop because they didn't have brakes and, as such, were not very popular. The initial \\"test piloting\\" of the first prototype of the skate was in the city of Huy, which had a party with Merlin playing the violin. In the 1840s, Meyerbeer's opera Le proph√®te featured a scene in which performers used roller-skates to simulate ice-skating on a frozen lake set on stage. The result was to popularize roller skating throughout the Continent. As ice skaters subsequently developed the art of figure skating, roller skaters wanted the ability to turn in their skates in a similar fashion.Wilson, David Gordon (2004). Bicycling Science, 3rd Edition. MIT Press. In 1863, James Plimpton from Massachusetts invented the \\"rocking\\" skate and used a four-wheel configuration for stability, and independent axles that turned by pressing to one side of the skate or the other when the skater wants to create an edge. This was a vast improvement on the Merlin design, one that was easier to use and drove the huge popularity of roller skating, dubbed \\"rinkomania\\" in the 1860s and 1870s,\\"The Victorian craze that sparked a mini- sexual revolution\\", BBC News, 6 April 2015 which spread to Europe and around the world, and continued through the 1930s. The Plimpton skate is still used today. Eventually, roller skating evolved from just a pastime to a competitive sport; speed skating, racing on skates, and inline figure skating, very similar to what can be seen in the Olympics on ice. In the mid 1990s roller hockey, played with a ball rather than a puck, became so popular that it even made an appearance in the Olympics in 1992. The National Sporting Goods Association statistics showed, from a 1999 study, that 2.5 million people played roller hockey. Roller skating was considered for the 2012 Summer Olympicshttp://www.skatemall.com/article-roller-skating-being-considered-for- olympics.aspx but has never become an Olympic event. Other roller skating sports include jam skating and roller derby. Roller skating popularity exploded during the disco era but tapered off in the 80s and 90s. Sales of roller skates increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as people sought safe outdoor activities.  Organizations  The Roller Skating Rink Operators Association was developed in the U.S. in 1937. It is currently named the Roller Skating Association. The association promotes roller skating and offers classes to the public, aiming to educate the population about roller skating. The current president is Bobby Pender. The Roller Skating Association headquarters is located in Indianapolis.

Biography He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Nathaniel Langdon Frothingham (1793- 1870), a prominent Unitarian preacher, and through his mother's family he was related to Phillips Brooks. He graduated from Harvard College in 1843 and from the Divinity School in 1846. On March 23, 1847, he married Caroline Martha Curtis (February 5, 1825 - June 8, 1900). =Pastorates= He was pastor of the North Unitarian church of Salem, Massachusetts, from 1847 to 1855. He broke with this congregation over the issue of slavery.George Harvey Genzmer, \\"Frothingham, Octavius Brooks,\\" Dictionary of American Biography, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1961. From 1855 to 1860, he was pastor of a new Unitarian society in Jersey City. There he gave up the Lord's Supper, thinking that it ministered to self-satisfaction. It was as a radical Unitarian that he became pastor of another young church in New York City in 1860. The name of the church was initially the Third Unitarian Congregational Church. From the beginning, Frothingham belonged to the most radical wing of the Unitarians. Indeed, in 1864 he was recognized as leader of the radicals after his reply to Dr Hedge's address to the graduating students of the Divinity School on \\"Anti- Supernaturalism in the Pulpit.\\" In 1865, when he had practically given up transcendentalism, his church building was sold and his congregation began to worship in Lyric Hall under the name of the Independent Liberal Church, their connection with the Unitarian denomination being thereby sundered. In 1875, they moved to the Masonic Temple, but four years later ill-health compelled Frothingham's resignation, and the church dissolved. Paralysis threatened him, and he never fully recovered his health. In 1881, he returned to Boston, and devoted himself to literary work until his death there. =Later life= To the later period of his life belongs his best literary work. While he was in New York, he was for a time art critic of the Tribune. Always himself on the unpopular side and an able but thoroughly fair critic of the majority, he habitually underestimated his own worth; he was not only an anti-slavery leader when abolition was not popular even in New England, and a radical and rationalist when it was impossible for him to stay conveniently in the Unitarian Church, but he was the first president of the Free Religious Association (1867) and an early and ardent disciple of Darwin and Spencer. Though always faithful to his radical views, in later years, his judgement grew more generous and catholic. He was a greater orator than a writer, and his sermons in New York were delivered to large audiences, averaging one thousand at the Masonic Temple, and were printed each week; in eloquence and in the charm of his spoken word he was probably surpassed in his day by none save George William Curtis. Personally he seemed cold and distant, partly because of his impressive appearance, and partly because of his own modesty, which made him backward in seeking friendships.

Both appear in the V√∂lsunga saga, which was adapted into other works such as Wagner's 'Ring' cycle, including its famous opera Die Walk√ºre. Signy is also the name of two characters in several other sagas. The first Signy is the daughter of King V√∂lsung. She was married to the villainous Geatish king Siggeir who has her whole family treacherously murdered, except for her brother Sigmund. She saves her brother, has an incestuous affair with him and bears the son Sinfj√∂tli. She burnt herself to death with her hated husband. The second Signy is the daughter of King Siggeir's nephew Sigar. She fell in love with the Sea-King Hagbard, and promised him that she would not live if he died. They were discovered and Hagbard was sentenced to be hanged. Hagbard managed to signal this to Signy who set her house on fire and died in the flames whereupon Hagbard hanged himself in the gallows. See Hagbard and Signy. A third Signy is the daughter of a witch named Grid in Illuga saga Gr√≠√∞arf√≥stra. They are both delivered from a curse by a young man named Illugi. A fourth Signy was Hro√∞gar's sister in Skj√∂ldunga saga and Hr√≥lfs saga kraka. She is unnamed in Beowulf. In V√∂lsunga saga Signy was the only daughter of King V√∂lsung of Hunaland and Hljod the giantess. She and her twin brother Sigmund were the oldest of Volsung‚Äôs eleven children. Signy reluctantly married King Siggeir of Gautland after he asked King Volsung for her hand. It was at their wedding feast that Sigmund drew the sword Gram from Barnstokkr. Three months after her wedding, Signy's father and brothers visited her at her new home in Gautland. Signy warned them of her husband‚Äôs plan to betray them. Despite her warning, Volsung is killed and all of Signy‚Äôs brothers are captured. At Signy‚Äôs request, her brothers are put in the stocks rather than executed, but each night one was killed by a she-wolf. When only Sigmund was left alive, Signy sent a man to smear honey on his face and mouth, which the wolf only licked, allowing Sigmund to escape alive. Signy then helped her brother to hide in the woods. Signy wanted nothing but to see her father‚Äôs death avenged. She sent her elder son to Sigmund for him to help in this endeavor. When Sigmund revealed to her that he was unworthy, Signy told Sigmund to kill him, which he did. The same happened with her younger son. Signy met a sorceress with whom she exchanged shapes. Signy, looking like the sorceress, went to her brother in the woods and slept with him for three nights. She then returned to the castle and regained her appearance. After a time she gave birth to a son Sinfj√∂tli. He was also sent to her brother in the forest when he was nine years old. Sigmund and Sinfj√∂tli kill Siggeir to avenge the death of their father/grandfather together. It is only after this that Signy informs Sigmund of the incest that led to Sinfj√∂tli's birth. Signy then walks into the fire that is killing her husband, announcing, \\"In everything I have worked toward the killing of King Siggeir. I have worked so hard to bring about vengeance that I am by no means fit to live. Willingly I will now die with King Siggeir, although I married him reluctantly.\\" Byock, Jesse L.

Early life and education He was born in Monrovia, California, to William C. deMille and the Scottish author and screenwriter Lorna Moon, when William C. was still married to his first wife, Anna George de Mille. His uncle, Cecil B. DeMille, adopted and raised Richard, not telling him of his true parentage until the death of his birth father when Richard was 33 years old. He first enrolled at Columbia University, later transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles before graduating. Writing career He served with the United States Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1946. That year, he became a writer and director at KTLA, remaining in that position through 1950. Around this time he joined the movement that was to become Scientology leaving KTLA to become an editorial/personal assistant to founder L. Ron Hubbard. De Mille used the nom de plume \\"D. Folgere\\" (an Anglo-Saxon phrase meaning \\"follower\\") when editing and/or ghost-writing during that time, despite Hubbard's protests that it would appear \\"Dick de Mille wasn't a true believer\\". He was attracted to Hubbard because, as he later said, \\"I thought he was a great man who had made a great discovery, and whatever his shortcomings they must be discounted because he had the answer.\\" On February 24, 1951, De Mille assisted Hubbard in kidnapping the latter's wife, Sara, from her apartment in Los Angeles in an unsuccessful bid to have her declared insane by a psychiatrist. They eventually released her in Yuma, Arizona. The two men had already taken Hubbard's daughter Alexis and a few days later flew together with Alexis to Havana, Cuba.Reitman, p. 37 By 1954 he had become disillusioned with Scientology and left the organization, explaining that he had \\"didn't like all the contradictions and I was becoming more and more sceptical of the whole thing\\". In 1955, he completed his B.A. degree at Pepperdine University and married Margaret Belgrano. He went on to get a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 1961. He remained with that institution as a research psychologist until 1962, when he became a lecturer in psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1965, he left that position, becoming editorial director of the Brooks Foundation the following year. He stayed there until 1967, becoming a research psychologist at the General Research Corp. in 1968, where he remained through 1973. =Writings on Carlos Castaneda= De Mille wrote Castaneda's Journey: The Power and the Allegory (publ. 1976), a book describing the detective work through which he said that Carlos Castaneda was a hoaxer and plagiarist and that don Juan is fictional.A Critical Look at Castaneda's Critics, Anton F. Koote, University of Florida.The A to Z of Shamanism by Jon Woronoff, Graham Harvey, Robert J.

Fenton is often referred to as \\"the Forgotten Town\\", because it was omitted by local author, Arnold Bennett, from many of his works based in the area, including one of his most famous novels, Anna of the Five Towns. History =Etymology= The name Fenton means 'fen farm'. =Administration= Fenton started to become populated as a group of farms and private small-holdings were built there, alongside a lane running from the southern reaches of Hanley (by 1933 this lane was very busy and given the title of the A50). Around the 1750s, the land was commonly known as Fenton Vivian, after Vivian of Standon and his heirs, its lords in the thirteenth century.'Fenton', in A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 8, ed. J G Jenkins (London, 1963), pp. 205-224 British History Online. Retrieved 9 July 2020. By the 1850s, the area around Duke Street and China Street had become populated during the rapid development of the Potteries. Potters settled in Fenton in large houses alongside their potbanks. Such houses include Great Fenton Hall, Fenton House (home of the Baker family), Heron Cottage and Grove House. The two principal districts, Fenton Vivian and Fenton Culvert ‚Äì each with their scattered communities, were brought together to make an urban district with its own board of guardians in 1894. On 1 April 1910, the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. By 1925, the area was granted city status.

This latter was immortalized in music in 2010, in a work for full symphony orchestra, written by local violinist, pianist, and composer, Vic Carnall, and entitled, \\"Glebedale Park Hill\\", which, with an orchestra of 100 players, received its premi√®re performance at The Victoria Hall, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, on 6 November 2010, as part of the centenary celebrations of Stoke-on-Trent's Federation in 1910. =Industry= Fenton has been the home to a number of potteries such as Coalport and Baker & Co, and its architectural heritage includes listed bottle ovens. =WW I= During the First World War Fenton was bombed by Zeppelin 'L 21'. Geography It is within easy reach of the A500, A34 and the A50, a short distance away from Longton, Hanley, Newcastle, and Stoke itself. =Suburbs= Although Fenton has large industrial plants, particularly from the Potteries trade, it has always been considered more of a residential area. Fenton includes Heron Cross, Mount Pleasant, Saxonfields, Pool Dole, Lane Delph and Fenpark. Places of interest Old Town Hall, Fenton Fenton Manor has a swimming pool, gym, and fitness centre, plus a 1,300-seater arena. Fenton Park has football pitches, pavilions, and a playground. The Town‚Äôs Library on Baker Street, a Carnegie library, is now closed. Fenton also had a Magistrates' Court, which served the City from within Fenton‚Äôs old Town Hall, built, in 1888, by local pottery owner, William Meath Baker, at his own expense, to a design by Robert Scrivener. Officially, it closed its doors in 2013, but, in part, has, since then, been reopened, with the following services on offer (on the building's ground floor): (1) coffee bar, open to the public on Monday to Saturday, inclusive, between the hours of 09.00 and 16.00; (2) art/pottery classes, especially for the young during school holidays. William Meath Baker was a very good friend of the great English composer, Sir Edward Elgar, who included him in his world-famous Enigma Variations (Variation IV). Economy Fenton differs from the other Potteries towns in that it does not have a town centre. Instead, amenities and shops are spread over a sizeable area.

The object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to a total of 13, the equivalent of the highest valued card in the deck, from a pyramid arrangement of 28 cards.\\"Pyramid\\" (p.207) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. When using the standard 52-card deck, Jacks are valued at 11, Queens at 12, and Kings at 13. Under the strictest rules, the odds of winning are around 1 in 50.Favorite Solitaire Card Games: Pyramid & Golf, PlayingCardDecks. September 9, 2020. Retrieved September 10, 2020. Rules To set up the pyramid, one card is dealt face up at the top of the playing area, then two cards beneath and partially covering it, then three beneath them, and so on completing with a row of seven cards for a total of 28 cards dealt (or six rows of 21 cards). The remaining cards are placed to the side face down, and make up the Stock. To play, pairs of exposed cards can be removed to the foundation if their values total 13. Thus, kings can be removed immediately to the foundation. In order to be removed, cards must not be covered, so when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed. You may draw cards from the stock one at a time and match it with any exposed card. If no match is made the drawn stock card is still discarded into the foundation. Once the stock is exhausted and/or no more pairs can be made, the game ends. To score, count the number of remaining face up cards in the pyramid. A perfect score is therefore zero, where all cards have been matched into the Foundation. To be considered won, all cards (cards from the pyramid and cards from the stock) must be moved to the foundation;\\"Pyramid\\" (p.70-73) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002. the game cannot be won if at least two cards cannot be moved from the stock. Variations Given the popularity of Pyramid, many different variants exist which alter aspects of the game, including the following: * Relaxed Pyramid: To be considered won, only the cards from the pyramid must be moved to the foundation, so the game can be won with cards still left in the stock. * Tut's Tomb (also called King Tut): Dealing three cards at a time from the stock, repeating until no matches can be made; placing all cards totalling 13 in a stack. * Apophis: Using three waste piles instead of one. * Giza: In a version created by Michael Keller, after the pyramid is formed, the rest of the deck is dealt as three rows of eight cards (i.e. eight columns of three overlapping cards) with the exposed cards open to match the exposed cards from the pyramid or other exposed cards. * Triangle: The initial deal consists of an inverted pyramid. * Redeals may be allowed. * A reserve of seven (or six) cards is dealt below the pyramid. These cards can match each other exposed cards in the pyramid or from the stack. * Playing with a cell, filled either from the tableau or from the waste upcard. Several variations allow a card on the pyramid to be removed in combination with a card covered by the first, so long as neither card is covered by a card not in the combo. For example, in the case of an exposed ace resting on a queen, the queen can be removed with the ace if no other cards are covering them, but if (for example) a jack is also on the queen, the queen cannot be removed. Other versions require that both cards be fully exposed to begin with. When playing with a 48-card Spanish deck the highest valued cards are the Kings at 12, and thus pairs of exposed cards can be removed if their values total 12. A variation of the game was released on the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 2 in 1991, under the name Tut's Tomb. It has also been added to Microsoft Solitaire Collection for Windows 8, Windows 10, Android, and iOS. When the game is played through Microsoft Solitaire Collection, the cards in the Stock are face-up rather than face-down.

Founded in 1973, it has a student population of approximately 12,500, distributed among 58 graduate, 40 Masters of Science and 25 PhD programs, distributed by departments and autonomous sections, with specialized faculties. It is a Research & Development university, with research departments developing programmes in fundamental and applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, telecommunications, robotics, bioinformatics, sea sciences, materials, design, business administration and industrial engineering. The main campus and nearby Administration and Accounting Institute, are located in the city centre of Aveiro. There are external/regional campuses in √Ågueda (Higher Education Technological and Management School of √Ågueda) and Oliveira de Azem√©is (Higher Education School of North Aveiro). It serves as a pole for the inter- university Doctoral program, along with the universities of Porto and Minho. Its integrated Masters in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering was the first Portuguese IT oriented European Accredited Engineering Masters (EUR- ACE) by the European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education.(ENAEE) History The main concourse between department blocks at the main campus The University of Aveiro central campus area with colonnades and department buildings. The Geosciences department at the University The rectory building at the University On 15 December 1973, at the inaugural speech of Professor Jos√© Veiga Sim√£o, then Minister of National Education () the new rector, stated: :\\"In the peaceful construction of the future and in defense of sacred and enduring values, here will rise the University of Aveiro. Announced in a speech at the Museum of Aveiro, the event was held to mark the first meeting of the commission establishing the University of Aveiro, that included Jos√© Sim√£o and other members of academic society and Aveiro. The first pedagogical and scientific activities began in 1974, with first days classes in the telecommunication course, comprising 46 students. The licentiate courses established at the University of Aveiro (UA) were the first courses in innovative areas, that were not explored by traditional universities at the time in Portugal, but important to regional or national initiatives. By 1976 there were courses in environmental science and education, natural sciences and education, mathematics and education, Portuguese-English and education and Portuguese-French and education. The student population included 338. It was only in that year that the first infrastructure were established in the area later known as the University Campus of Santigao (). During the 1977‚Äì1978 lecture year, there was a proposal to create a pilot project: the first Centro Integrado de Forma√ß√£o de Professores (CIFOP), today the Integrated Unit for Continuing Education (), in the country. At UA, the intention was to establish a training institute for professors/teachers, from infant education to secondary school, using the latest pedagogical resources and innovative methods. The project was headed by Professor Jo√£o Evangelista Loureiro, the former vice-rector at UA. A period of consolidation occurred at the university in the 1980s, resulting in internal regulation and the creation of fundamental bodies (during the mandate of the second rector Dr. Jos√© Mesquita Rodrigues) as well as the conclusion of the purchase of lands for the campus, later completed during the mandate of Dr. Renato Ara√∫jo. By the end of the 1980s (specifically 24 September 1988), the law for university autonomy, permitted the consolidation of the university organic laws, and homologation of the university statutes, in June 1989. Meanwhile, a team coordinated by architect Nuno Portas, had begun selecting among various prestigious Portuguese architects in 1986 to design the Santigao University Campus, that fell in line with their attempt to harmonize the structures with the architectural heritage of the city. Many of the buildings, therefore, were designed by internationally recognized architects, among them: Alcino Soutinho, √Ålvaro Sisa Vieira, Pedro Ramalho, Lu√≠s Ramalho, Jos√© Maria Lopo Prata, Eduardo Souto Moura, Adalberto Dias, Rebello de Andrade, Jorge Kol de Carvalho, Gon√ßalo Byrne and Figueiredo Dias, whose works have annually been visited by national and international specialists. By the mid-1980s teaching had expanded with innovative courses in Environment, Industrial Management, Music, Tourism, Chemical Industry and New Technologies. The 1990s was marked by a new phase at UA, with priorities redefined to position the university towards internationalization and cooperation, namely European programs, reinforcing relationships with Portuguese-speaking and Latin states, and building protocols between international institutes, organs and companies abroad. In parallel there were initiatives in continuing education, distance learning and improving student satisfaction and quality. In 1994, an Internet search engine, SAPO, was created in this university. Since 1998, the University has been developing an ecological motor vehicle, √çcaro, aiming to run the largest distance with the smallest amount of consumed fuel, having participated in the international competition Shell Eco-marathon. During the second mandate of the fourth rector, Dr. J√∫lio Pedrosa, the student population was 8000, and the university had the most number of internationally recognized programs. During 25th anniversary celebrations, UA advanced with the integration of polytechnical study into early training programs. The creation of the Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gest√£o de √Ågueda (in 1997), the integration of the Instituto de Contabilidade e Administra√ß√£o de Aveiro (in 1999), the implementation of the Escola Superior de Sa√∫de (in 2000), and the implementation of a polytechnical school in the northern district, the Escola Superior Aveiro-Norte], was part of this process of integration. In 2012‚Äì13, it was ranked 351‚Äì400 in the Times Higher Education World University rankings. Rankingshttp://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university- rankings/2012-13/world-ranking/region/europe The first mandate of its sixth rector, Dr. Maria Helena Nazar√©, was marked by the start of professional program in technology (2002‚Äì2003). Since 2009, it has hosted a SexLab aimed at studying sexual health. On February 2010 Professor Manuel Ant√≥nio de Assun√ß√£o took charge as the seventh rector, a position held for two mandates until May 2018. During this time he promoted the establishment of the F√°brica ‚Äì Centro de Ci√™ncia Viva de Aveiro. On 8 May 2018 Dr. Paulo Jorge Ferreira took office as the eight rector. Culture The University hosts 3810-UA, a weekly national public television program. In mid-spring, a one-week break from formal studies is allowed, wherein anyone may participate in academic activities, concerts or Enterro do Ano, a local academic parade. The University is a regular participant or organizer of robotics inter-university or inter-school competitions, i.e.: Micro-Rato (hardware robotics) and Cyber- Rato (behavioral software). In 2008, one of its teams won the Robocup world competition, in China. The University occasionally organizes mathematics competitions, mostly aimed at pre-university level students. University Campus Santiago The university architecture is modern, with more than 25 buildings. As an organization, the university is composed of departments (one of them built by Eduardo Souto de Moura), autonomous sections, research units, administrative and service facilities, a library (built by √Ålvaro Siza), a mediateque, a field track, a multisports building with gym, a residential complex, green spaces, ecological spots and parking lots. The rectory (built by Gon√ßalo Byrne) is located in a white building near the campus centre. The campus also has an entire Administration and Accounting Institute, which has its own service facilities and parking lots. Research The projects developed by UA are developed under 19 research centres, of many different scientific areas. As a research-led institution, during 2015, 316 research and technology transfer projects were active in UA. 80 of these projects are/were funded by International and European Programmes, of which 27 by the 7th Framework Programme, 13 by the Horizon 2020 and 17 by the ERASMUS +.

Serving as the beginning of the Capitol Hill district, the historic building sits slightly higher than the rest of downtown Denver. The main entrance hall is open 180 feet (55 m) to the top of the dome, about the height of an 18-story building. Additionally, the official elevation of Denver is measured outside the west entrance to the building, where the fifteenth step is engraved with the words \\"One Mile Above Sea Level\\". From this step, at , the sun can be seen setting behind the Rocky Mountains. A second mile high marker was set in the 18th step in 1969 when Colorado State University students resurveyed the elevation. In 2003, a more accurate measurement was made with modern means, and the 13th step was identified as being one mile (1.6 km) high, where a 3rd marker was installed. The interior of the building uses copious amounts of Colorado Rose Onyx, a rare rose marble from a quarry near Beulah. The amount used in the building consumed the entire known supply. White Yule Marble from the quarries near Marble, Colorado was also used throughout the capitol for the floors. Many designs have been found in the marble including an image resembling George Washington and another of Molly Brown. A major safety upgrade project, funded by the Colorado State Historical Fund, was started in 2001 and completed in 2009.History Colorado . Coloradohistory-oahp.org. Retrieved 2013-09-18. The design by Fentress Architects added modern safety features, like enclosed stair towers, that blend in with the original architecture.Fentress completes work on Capitol‚Äôs safety project - Denver Business Journal.

Many of the windows are stained glass, depicting people or events related to the history of Colorado. The halls are decorated with portraits of every president of the United States, with all the presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush being painted by Lawrence Williams, dying before he was able to do one for Barack Obama. Painter Sarah A. Boardman took over from Williams, and has since painted Donald Trump as well. One of the contractors for the construction of the Colorado State Capitol building was Illinois building contractor William Douglas Richardson, who was the president of the W. D. Richardson Construction Company. Richardson had participated in numerous major building contracts throughout the United States, and was interconnected with the Jacob Bunn and John Whitfield Bunn network of corporations.William Douglas Richardson was the father of Jacob Bunn's daughter-in-law.

Spouse to Ann Carroll Fitzhugh, Smith was a candidate for President of the United States in 1848, 1856, and 1860, but only served 18 months in the federal government‚Äîin Congress as a Free Soil Party Representative, in 1853‚Äì4. Smith, a significant financial contributor to the Liberty Party and the Republican Party throughout his life, spent much time and money working towards social progress in the nineteenth-century United States. Besides making substantial donations of both land and money to create Timbuctoo, an African-American community in North Elba, New York, he was involved in the temperance movement and the colonization movement,Stauffer, The Black Hearts of Men, p. 265 before abandoning colonization in favor of abolitionism, the immediate freeing of all the slaves. He was a member of the Secret Six who financially supported John Brown's raid at Harpers Ferry, in 1859.Renehan, pp.13-14 Brown's farm, in North Elba, was on land he bought from Smith. Early life =Forebears= Smith was born in Utica, New York, to Peter Gerrit Smith, whose ancestors were from Holland, and Elizabeth (Livingston) Smith, daughter of Col. James Livingston and Elizabeth (Simpson) Livingston. \\"In partnership with John Jacob Astor in the fur trade and alone in real estate, Peter Smith [had] managed to amass a considerable fortune. He turned over a $400,000 business [] to his son Gerrit in 1819 and bequeathed $800,000 more [] to his children in 1837. Smith was the county judge of Madison and has been described as 'easily its leading citizen'.\\" He was \\"a devout and emotionally religious man[...]. From 1822 on, Peter Smith was intensely engaged in the work of the Bible and Tract societies.\\" Gerrit also inherited of land from his father, and at one point he owned , an area bigger than Rhode Island. Gerrit Smith house, Peterboro, New York, from an 1878 book. The house was destroyed by fire in 1936. Smith's maternal aunt, Margaret Livingston, was married to Judge Daniel Cady. Their daughter Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a founder and leader of the women's suffrage movement, was Smith's first cousin. Elizabeth Cady met her future husband, Henry Stanton, also an active abolitionist, at the Smith family home in Peterboro, New York.Griffith, p.26 Established in 1795, the town had been founded by and named for Gerrit Smith's father, Peter Smith, who built the family homestead there in 1804.Renehan, p.16; Historic Peterboro Gerrit came there when he was 9. =Gerrit as a young man= Gerrit was described as \\"tall, magnificently built and magnificently proportioned, his large head superbly set on his shoulders;\\" he \\"might have served as a model for a Greek god in the days when man deified beauty and worshipped it.\\" He attended Hamilton Oneida Academy in Clinton, Oneida County, New York, and graduated with honors from its successor Hamilton College in 1818, giving the valedictory address, and describing his stay at the college as \\"very active with many friends\\". In January 1819, he married Wealtha Ann Backus (1800‚Äì1819), daughter of Hamilton College's first President, Azel Backus D.D. (1765‚Äì1817), and sister of Frederick F. Backus (1794‚Äì1858). Wealtha died in August of the same year. Returning home from college, Smith took on the management of the vast estate of his father, a long-standing partner of John Jacob Astor, and greatly increased the family fortune, described as \\"monumental\\". In 1822, he married Ann Carroll Fitzhugh (1805‚Äì1879), sister of Henry Fitzhugh (1801‚Äì1866); their relationship was \\"loving\\". They had eight children, but only Elizabeth Smith Miller (1822‚Äì1911) and Greene Smith (ca. 1841‚Äì1880) survived to adulthood. He became an active temperance campaigner, and claimed to have given in 1824 the first temperance speech ever in the New York State Legislature. In his hometown of Peterboro, he built one of the first temperance hotels in the country. Smith wrote of himself: =Geritt in the 1830s= He attended numerous revival meetings, and taught Sunday school. He thought of establishing a seminary for negro students. In 1834 he began a Peterboro Manual Labor School for Blacks, along the model of nearby Oneida Institute. It had only one instructor, and it lasted only one year. Previously a supporter of the American Colonization Society, he became an abolitionist in 1835, after a mob in Utica, including New York congressman Samuel Beardsley, broke up the initial meeting of the New York Anti-Slavery Society, which he attended at the urging of his friends Beriah Green and Alvan Stewart. He resigned as a trustee of Hamilton College \\"on the grounds that the school was insufficiently anti-slavery\\", and joined the board of and financially assisted the Oneida Institute, \\"a hotbed of anti- slavery activity\\". He contributed $9,000 () to support schools in Liberia, but realized by 1835 that the American Colonization Society had no intention of abolishing slavery. Smith was a laggard instead of a leader in changing from supporting colonization to \\"immediatism\\", immediate full abolitionism. Support for Jefferson Davis after the war would be unthinkable for Garrison, Douglass, or other abolitionist leaders. Political career In 1840, Smith played a leading part in the organization of the Liberty Party. In the same year, their presidential candidate James G. Birney married Elizabeth Potts Fitzhugh, Smith's sister-in-law. Smith and Birney travelled to London that year to attend the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London.List of delegates, 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention, 1840, Retrieved 2 August 2015 Birney, but not Smith, is recorded in the commemorative painting of the event. In 1848, Smith was nominated for the Presidency by the remnant of this organization that had not been absorbed by the Free Soil Party. An \\"Industrial Congress\\" at Philadelphia also nominated him for the presidency in 1848, and the \\"Land Reformers\\" in 1856. In 1840 and again in 1858, he ran for Governor of New York on an anti- slavery platform. Smith made women's suffrage a plank in the Liberty Party platform on June 14‚Äì15, 1848. On June 2, 1848, in Rochester, New York, Smith was nominated as the Liberty Party's presidential candidate.Wellman, 2004, p. 176. At the National Liberty Convention, held June 14‚Äì15 in Buffalo, New York, Smith gave a major address,Claflin, Alta Blanche. Political parties in the United States 1800-1914, New York Public Library, 1915, p. 50 including in his speech a demand for \\"universal suffrage in its broadest sense, females as well as males being entitled to vote.\\" The delegates approved a passage in their address to the people of the United States addressing votes for women: \\"Neither here, nor in any other part of the world, is the right of suffrage allowed to extend beyond one of the sexes. This universal exclusion of woman...argues, conclusively, that, not as yet, is there one nation so far emerged from barbarism, and so far practically Christian, as to permit woman to rise up to the one level of the human family.\\" Reverend Charles C. Foote was nominated as his running mate. The ticket would come in fourth place in the election, carrying 2,545 popular votes, all from New York. By 1856, very little of the Liberty Party remained after most of its members joined the Free Soil Party in 1848 and nearly of all what remained of the party joined the Republicans in 1854. The small remnant of the party renominated Smith under the name of the \\"National Liberty Party\\". In 1860, the remnant of the party was also called the Radical Abolitionists. A convention of one hundred delegates was held in Convention Hall, Syracuse, New York, on August 29, 1860. Delegates were in attendance from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. Several of the delegates were women. Smith, despite his poor health, fought William Goodell in regard to the nomination for the presidency. In the end, Smith was nominated for president and Samuel McFarland from Pennsylvania was nominated for vice president. The ticket won 171 popular votes from Illinois and Ohio. In Ohio, a slate of presidential electors pledged to Smith ran with the name of the Union Party. Smith, along with his friend and ally Lysander Spooner, was a leading advocate of the United States Constitution as an antislavery document, as opposed to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who believed it was to be condemned as a pro-slavery document. In 1852, Smith was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Free-Soiler. In his address, he declared that all men have an equal right to the soil; that wars are brutal and unnecessary; that slavery could be sanctioned by no constitution, state or federal; that free trade is essential to human brotherhood; that women should have full political rights; that the Federal government and the states should prohibit the liquor traffic within their respective jurisdictions; and that government officers, so far as practicable, should be elected by direct vote of the people. Unhappy with his separation from his home and business, Smith resigned his seat at the end of the first session, ostensibly to allow voters sufficient time to select his successor.\\"Resignation of Gerrit Smith,\\" New York Daily Times, vol. 3, whole no. 868 (June 29, 1854), pg. 1. In 1869, Smith served as a delegate to the founding convention of the Prohibition Party. During the 1872 presidential election Smith was considered for the Prohibition Party's presidential nomination. Social activism Gerrit Smith After becoming an opponent of land monopoly, he gave numerous farms of each to indigent families. In 1846, hoping to help black families become self- sufficient, to isolate and thus protect them from escaped slave-hunters, and to provide them with the property ownership that African Americans needed to vote in New York, Smith attempted to colonize approximately of land in remote North Elba, New York (near Lake Placid), with free blacks. Abolitionist John Brown joined his project, purchasing land and moving his family there. The difficulty of farming in the Adirondack Mountains, coupled with the settlers' lack of experience in housebuilding and the bigotry of white neighbors, caused the \\"Timbuctoo\\" experiment to fail.Renehan, pp 17-18 Peterboro became a station on the Underground Railroad. Due to his connections with it, Smith financially supported a planned mass slave escape in Washington, D.C., in April 1848, organized by William L. Chaplin, another abolitionist, as well as numerous members of the city's large free black community. The Pearl incident attracted widespread national attention after the 77 slaves were intercepted and captured about two days after they sailed from the capital.Mary Kay Ricks, Escape on the Pearl: The Heroic Bid for Freedom on the Underground Railroad, New York: HarperCollins Publishers, January 2007 After 1850, Smith furnished money for the legal expenses of persons charged with infractions of the Fugitive Slave Law.Renehan, p.12 Smith became a leading figure in the Kansas Aid Movement, a campaign to raise money and show solidarity with anti-slavery immigrants to that territory.Harlow, Ralph Volney. (1939) Gerrit Smith, philanthropist and reformer p. 351 It was during this movement that he first met and financially supported John Brown.Heidler, David Stephen. (1996) Encyclopedia of the American Civil War p. 1812Harlow, Ralph Volney. (1939) Gerrit Smith, philanthropist and reformer He later became more closely acquainted with Brown, to whom he sold a farm in North Elba for $1/acre, and from time to time supplied him with funds. In 1859, Smith joined the Secret Six, a group of influential northern abolitionists, who supported Brown in his efforts to capture the armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, and start a slave revolt. After the failed raid on Harpers Ferry, Senator Jefferson Davis unsuccessfully attempted to have Smith accused, tried, and hanged along with Brown. Upset by the raid, its outcome, and its aftermath, Smith suffered a mental breakdown, and for several weeks was confined to the state asylum in Utica.Renehan, pp.13-14 When the Chicago Tribune later claimed Smith had full knowledge of Brown's plan at Harper's Ferry, Smith sued the paper for libel, claiming that he lacked any such knowledge and thought only that Brown wanted guns so that slaves who ran away to join him might defend themselves against attackers. Smith's claim was countered by the Tribune, which produced an affidavit, signed by Brown's son, swearing that Smith had full knowledge of all the particulars of the plan, including the plan to instigate a slave uprising. In writing later of these events, Smith said, \\"That affair excited and shocked me, and a few weeks after I was taken to a lunatic asylum. From that day to this I have had but a hazy view of dear John Brown's great work. Indeed, some of my impressions of it have, as others have told me, been quite erroneous and even wild.\\" Smith was a major benefactor of New-York Central College, McGrawville, a co-educational and racially integrated college in Cortland County. Smith was in favor of the Civil War, but at its close he advocated a mild policy toward the late Confederate states, declaring that part of the guilt of slavery lay upon the North. In 1867, Smith, together with Horace Greeley and Cornelius Vanderbilt, helped to underwrite the $100,000 bond needed to free Jefferson Davis, who had, at that time, been imprisoned for nearly two years without being charged with any crime.Renehan, p.11 In doing this, Smith incurred the resentment of Northern Radical Republican leaders. Smith's passions extended to religion as well as politics. Believing that sectarianism was sinful, he separated from the Presbyterian Church in 1843. He was one of the founders of the Church at Peterboro, a non-sectarian institution open to all Christians of whatever denomination. His private benefactions were substantial; of his gifts he kept no record, but their value is said to have exceeded $8,000,000. Though a man of great wealth, his life was one of marked simplicity. He died in 1874 while visiting relatives in New York City. The Gerrit Smith Estate, in Peterboro, New York, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001.

Two teams compete to score as many touchdowns as possible in the tradition of American football, but actual play is more similar to rugby football. A version for the Sega Genesis, retitled Pigskin Footbrawl and endorsed by coach Jerry Glanville, was released by Razor Soft on December 18, 1992.Josh Wirtanen, \\"Jerry Glanville‚Äôs Pigskin Footbrawl Brought Hyper-Violent Football to the Genesis in 1992\\", Retrovolve' Gameplay Players control one of the team members, navigating the hazards on the field and dispatching opponents using weapons. The current team strategy is displayed near the top of the screen, along with the score. The player directly controls one member of a five-man team, with the object of carrying a football over the opposing team's goal line. The playing area is littered with hazards such as pits, bushes and logs. A ball carrier who trips over any of these, or who is punched by an opponent, fumbles the ball. The field is also laden with weapons: axes, maces, nooses, scythes, spears, swords and torches. A player can pick up one of these by running over it. It will appear at the top of the screen next to the player's score as a \\"concealed weapon\\", several weapons may be carried at once and one may be carried over after a touchdown. The ball carrier can be \\"grappled\\", essentially a mass tackle into which multiple characters can jump. Having a concealed weapon as well as having more characters jump into the grapple greatly increases a team's chance of gaining or retaining possession, although weapons cannot be used if both team captains are in the grapple. A character who is injured by a concealed weapon is out of play until a touchdown is scored. If one team gets too far behind in score in the second half of the game, a computer-controlled troll is added to the losing side to help even the odds, and behaves more aggressively than regular players. Additionally, the troll cannot be killed by weapons. Up to two trolls can be in play at a time during a standard game (one per side or two on one side). During a one player \\"Pro Pigskin\\" game, if the computer-controlled team continues to lose heavily even after a troll has been added or falls behind very quickly early on, an option for a \\"Troll Bowl\\" will appear. If selected the player will face an entire team of trolls with only human players on their own side. Gameplay tips are given between periods and statistics are given at the end of the game. Statistics cover Goals Scored, Injuries Inflicted and Pigskin Possession Time. Before the game we can read about teams background. Both teams are renegades bands. The blue band is led by Thor Akenbak, and the red one's captain is Atilla DeSoil. =Scoring= A touchdown is worth six points, with a one-point bonus for keeping possession of the ball for longer than a minimum time. (Approximately 10 seconds) It is possible to gain very high scores by eliminating most of the opposing team and then maintaining possession of the ball for as long as possible. Since a period can only end on a change of possession, a player can keep gaining single possession points well after the period clock has run out. =Controls= Pigskin has two pass buttons, a punch button, and a button for selecting the team's strategy (\\"Block\\", \\"Scatter\\" and \\"Bad Attitude\\" when the player's team is in possession of the ball; \\"Get Ball\\", \\"Man-to-Man\\" and \\"Bad Attitude\\" when the opponent has it).

Retrieved on 2008-07-23 Before joining the DI, Meyer was a professor at Whitworth College. Meyer is a Senior Fellow of the DI and Director of the CSC. Biography Meyer graduated with B.S. degrees in physics and earth science in 1981 from the Christian Whitworth College, then worked as a geophysicist for the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) in Dallas from November 1981 to December 1985. Meyer then took up a scholarship from the Rotary Club of Dallas to study History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University in England. His 1990 dissertation was entitled \\"Of clues and causes: A methodological interpretation of origin of life studies.\\" Meyer received his Ph.D. from Cambridge in 1991. In Fall 1990 he became an assistant professor of philosophy at Whitworth, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1995, and gained tenure in 1996. In Fall 2002 he moved to the position of professor, Conceptual Foundations of Science, at the Christian Palm Beach Atlantic University. He continued there to Spring 2005, then ceased teaching to devote his time to the intelligent design movement. Work =Creation science= As an undergraduate, Meyer had been \\"quite comfortable accepting the standard evolutionary story, although I put a bit of a theistic spin on it ‚Äì that (evolution) is how God operated\\", but during his work with ARCO in Dallas, he was influenced by a conference: \\"I remember being especially fascinated with the origins debate at this conference. It impressed me to see that scientists who had always accepted the standard evolutionary story were now defending a theistic belief, not on the basis that it makes them feel good or provides some form of subjective contentment, but because the scientific evidence suggests an activity of mind that is beyond nature. I was really taken with this.\\" Charles Thaxton organised the conference held in Dallas on 9‚Äì10 February 1985, featuring Antony Flew, and Dean H. Kenyon who spoke on \\"Going Beyond the Naturalistic Mindset: Origin of Life Studies\\". Meyer became part of Thaxton's circle, and joined the debate with two articles published in March 1986: in one, he discussed The Mystery of Life's Origin which Thaxton had recently co-authored, commenting that the book had \\"done well to intimate that 'we are not alone.' Only revelation can now identify the Who that is with us.\\" The other article discussed the 1981 McLean v. Arkansas and 1985 Aguillard v. Treen district court case rulings that teaching creation science in public schools was unconstitutional as creationism originated in religious conviction, and its reliance on \\"tenets of faith\\" implied it was not scientific. Meyer argued that modern scientific method equally relied on \\"foundational assumptions\\" based on faith in naturalism, which \\"assumed all events to be exclusively the result of physical or natural causes\\", so on the definition used in the court cases \\"science itself does not qualify as legitimate science\\". He proposed that \\"scientists and philosophers\\" could turn to Biblical presupposition to explain \\"the ultimate source of human reason, the existence of a real and uniformly ordered universe, and the ability present in a creative and ordered human intellect to know that universe. Both the Old and New Testaments define these relationships such that the presuppositional base necessary to modern science is not only explicable but also meaningful.\\" Meyer's argument on epistemological presuppositions and accusation that evolution is based on an assumption of naturalism became central to the design movement. At the university of Cambridge in England, he met theology student Mark Labberton. In the Fall of 1987 Labberton introduced Meyer to Phillip E. Johnson who was on a sabbatical at University College London, and having become \\"obsessed with evolution\\" had begun writing a book on what he saw as its problems. Meyer says \\"We walked around Cambridge kicking the pea gravel and talking over all the issues.\\", also at An article co- authored by Meyer and Thaxton published on 27 December 1987 asserted that \\"human rights depend upon the Creator who made man with dignity, not upon the state.\\" They contrasted this with \\"purely material, scientific\\" ideas which equated humans to animals, and restated their central thesis that \\"Only if man is (in fact) a product of special Divine purposes can his claim to distinctive or intrinsic dignity be sustained.\\" The terminology and concepts later featured in the Wedge strategy and theistic realism. = Intelligent Design = After the 1987 Edwards v. Aguillard Supreme Court ruling affirmed the Aguillard v. Treen decision against teaching creation science, Thaxton as academic editor of Of Pandas and People adopted intelligent design wording. Meyer recalls the term coming up at a June 1988 conference in Tacoma organised by Thaxton, who \\"referred to a theory that the presence of DNA in a living cell is evidence of a designing intelligence.\\" Phillip E. Johnson was drafting a book arguing against naturalism as the basis for evolutionary science, and Meyer brought a copy of the manuscript to the conference. He met Paul A. Nelson who found it exciting to read, and the two collaborated on a joint project. Needing a mathematician, they contacted Dembski in 1991. Thaxton has described Meyer as \\"kind of like\\" a Johnny Appleseed, bringing others into the movement. Meyer became one of a group of prominent young intelligent design (ID) advocates with academic degrees: Mayer, Nelson, Dembski and Jonathan Wells. Meyer participated in the \\"Ad Hoc Origins Committee\\" defending Johnson's Darwin on Trial in 1992 or 1993 (in response to Stephen Jay Gould's review of it in the July 1992 issue of Scientific American), while with the Philosophy department at Whitworth College. He was later a participant in the first formal meeting devoted to ID, hosted at Southern Methodist University in 1992. In December 1993, Bruce Chapman, president and founder of the Discovery Institute, noticed an essay in the Wall Street Journal by Meyer about a dispute when biology lecturer Dean H. Kenyon taught intelligent design in introductory classes.\\"Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive\\", Jodi Wilgoren. The New York Times, August 21, 2005. Kenyon had co-authored Of Pandas and People, and in 1993 Meyer had contributed to the teacher's notes for the second edition of Pandas. Meyer was an old friend of Discovery Institute co-founder George Gilder, and over dinner about a year later they formed the idea of a think tank opposed to materialism. In the summer of 1995 Chapman and Meyer met a representative of Howard Ahmanson, Jr. Meyer, who had previously tutored Ahmanson's son in science, recalls being asked \\"What could you do if you had some financial backing?\\" He was a co-author of the \\"Wedge strategy\\", which put forth the Discovery Institute's manifesto for the intelligent design movement. In 1999, Meyer with David DeWolf and Mark DeForrest laid out a legal strategy for introducing intelligent design into public schools in their book Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curriculum. Meyer has co-edited Darwinism, Design, and Public Education (Michigan State University Press, 2000) with John Angus Campbell and co-edited Science and Evidence of Design in the Universe (Ignatius Press, 2000) with Michael J. Behe and William A. Dembski. In 2009, his book Signature in the Cell was released and in December of that year. Meyer has been described as \\"the person who brought ID (intelligent design) to DI (Discovery Institute)\\" by historian Edward Larson, who was a fellow at the Discovery Institute prior to it becoming the center of the intelligent design movement. In 2004, the DI helped introduce ID to the Dover Area School District, which resulted in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case where ID was ruled to be based on religious beliefs rather than scientific evidence. Discussing ID in relation to Dover, on May 6, 2005 Meyer debated Eugenie Scott, on The Big Story with John Gibson. During the debate, Meyer argued that intelligent design is critical of more than just evolutionary mechanisms like natural selection that lead to diversification, but of common descent itself. = Films and debates = He has appeared on television and in public forums advocating intelligent design. Notably he wrote and appeared in the Discovery Institute's 2002 film Unlocking the Mystery of Life and was interviewed in the 2008 Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed movie. He has also been an active debater such as in April 2006 with Peter Ward, a paleontologist from the University of Washington held an open online discussion on the topic of intelligent design in the Talk of the Times forum in Seattle, WA. Meyer has also debated atheists Peter Atkins, Eugenie Scott and Michael Shermer. = Teach the Controversy = In March, 2002, Meyer announced a \\"teach the controversy\\" strategy, which alleges that the theory of evolution is controversial within scientific circles, following a presentation to the Ohio State Board of Education. The presentation included submission of an annotated bibliography of 44 peer-reviewed scientific articles that were said to raise significant challenges to key tenets of \\"Darwinian evolution\\". In response to this claim the National Center for Science Education, an organisation that works in collaboration with National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of Biology Teachers, and the National Science Teachers Association that support the teaching of evolution in public schools, contacted the authors of the papers listed and 26 scientists, representing 34 of the papers, responded. None of the authors considered that their research provided evidence against evolution. On March 11, 2002 during a panel discussion on evolution Meyer publicly told the Ohio Board of Education that the \\"Santorum Amendment\\" was part of the Education Bill, and therefore that the State of Ohio was required to teach alternative theories to evolution as part of its biology curriculum. Professor of Biology, Kenneth R. Miller replied that Conference Reports do not carry the weight of law and that in implying that they do, Meyer factually misstated the nature and gravitas of the Santorum Amendment. = Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington article= On 4 August 2004, an article by Meyer appeared in the peer-reviewed scientific journal, Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. On September 7, the publisher of the journal, the Council of the Biological Society of Washington, released a statement retracting the article as not having met its scientific standards, and saying that it had been published at the discretion of the former editor, Richard Sternberg, \\"without review by any associate editor\\". Critics believe that Sternberg's personal and ideological connections to Meyer suggest at least the appearance of conflict of interest in allowing Meyer's paper to be published. The journal's reasons for disavowing the article were rebutted by Sternberg, who says the paper underwent the standard peer-review process and that he was encouraged to publish it by a member of the Council of the BSW. A critical review of the article is available on the Panda's Thumb website. In January 2005, the Discovery Institute posted its response to the critique on their website. =Claims of persecution= Meyer contends that those who oppose Darwinism are persecuted by the scientific community and prevented from publishing their views. In 2001, he signed the statement A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism, coinciding with the launch of the PBS TV series Evolution, saying in part: > The numbers of scientists who question Darwinism is a minority, but it is > growing fast. This is happening in the face of fierce attempts to intimidate > and suppress legitimate dissent. Young scientists are threatened with > deprivation of tenure. Others have seen a consistent pattern of answering > scientific arguments with ad hominem attacks. In particular, the series' > attempt to stigmatize all critics ‚Äì including scientists ‚Äì as religious > \\"creationists\\" is an excellent example of viewpoint discrimination. A wide range of scholarly, science education and legislative sources have denied, refuted, or off-handedly dismissed these allegations. In a 2006 article published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, a group of writers that included historian of science Ronald L. Numbers (author of The Creationists), philosopher of biology Elliott Sober, Wisconsin State Assembly woman Terese Berceau and four members of the department of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison characterized such claims as being a \\"hoax\\". In their website refuting the claims in the film Expelled (which featured Meyer), the National Center for Science Education states that, \\"Intelligent design advocates ... have no research and no evidence, and have repeatedly shown themselves unwilling to formulate testable hypotheses; yet they complain about an imagined exclusion, even after having flunked the basics.\\"Challenging Science, Expelled Exposed, National Center for Science Education In analysing an Academic Freedom bill that was based upon a Discovery Institute model statute, the Florida Senate found that: \\"According to the Department of Education, there has never been a case in Florida where a public school teacher or public school student has claimed that they have been discriminated against based on their science teaching or science course work.\\"Bill Analysis and Fiscal Impact Statement, The Professional Staff of the Education Pre-K‚Äì12 Committee, Florida Senate, March 26, 2008 = Signature in the Cell = On June 23, 2009, HarperOne released Meyer's Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design. The philosopher Thomas Nagel, who generally argues in opposition to the philosophical position of physicalist reductionism specifically and materialism more generally, submitted the book as his contribution to the \\"2009 Books of the Year\\" supplement for The Times, writing \\"Signature in the Cell...is a detailed account of the problem of how life came into existence from lifeless matter ‚Äì something that had to happen before the process of biological evolution could begin ... Meyer is a Christian, but atheists, and theists who believe God never intervenes in the natural world, will be instructed by his careful presentation of this fiendishly difficult problem.\\"2009 Books of the Year, The Times Stephen Fletcher, chemist at Loughborough University, responded in The Times Literary Supplement that Nagel was \\"promot[ing] the book to the rest of us using statements that are factually incorrect.\\" Fletcher explained \\"Natural selection is in fact a chemical process as well as a biological process, and it was operating for about half a billion years before the earliest cellular life forms appear in the fossil record.\\" In another publication, Fletcher wrote: \\"I am afraid that reality has overtaken Meyer's book and its flawed reasoning\\", pointing out scientific problems with Meyer's work by citing how RNA \\"survived and evolved into our own human protein-making factory, and continues to make our fingers and toes.\\" Darrel Falk, former president of the BioLogos Foundation and a biology professor at Point Loma Nazarene University, reviewed the book, saying it illustrates why he does not support the intelligent design movement. Falk is critical of Meyer's declaration of scientists being wrong, such as Michael Lynch about genetic drift, without Meyer having done any experiment or calculation to disprove Lynch's assertion. Falk writes, \\"the book is supposed to be a science book and the ID movement is purported to be primarily a scientific movementnot primarily a philosophical, religious, or even popular movement\\", but concludes \\"If the object of the book is to show that the Intelligent Design movement is a scientific movement, it has not succeeded. In fact, what it has succeeded in showing is that it is a popular movement grounded primarily in the hopes and dreams of those in philosophy, in religion, and especially those in the general public.\\" =Darwin's Doubt= On 18 June 2013, HarperOne released Darwin's Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design. In this book, Meyer proposed that the Cambrian explosion contradicts Darwin's evolutionary process and is best explained by intelligent design. In a review published by The Skeptics Society titled \\"Stephen Meyer's Fumbling Bumbling Amateur Cambrian Follies\\", paleontologist Donald Prothero gave a highly negative review of Meyer's book. Prothero pointed out that the \\"Cambrian Explosion\\" concept itself has been deemed an outdated concept after recent decades of fossil discovery and he points out that 'Cambrian diversification' is a more consensual term now used in paleontology to describe the 80 million-year time frame where the fossil record shows the gradual and stepwise evolution of more and more complicated animal life. Prothero criticizes Meyer for ignoring much of the fossil record and instead focusing on a later stage to give the impression that all Cambrian life forms appeared abruptly without predecessors. In contrast, Prothero cites paleontologist B.S. Lieberman that the rates of evolution during the 'Cambrian explosion' were typical of any adaptive radiation in life's history. He quotes another prominent paleontologist Andrew Knoll that '20 million years is a long time for organisms that produce a new generation every year or two' without the need to invoke any unknown processes. Going through a list of topics in modern evolutionary biology Meyer used to bolster his idea in the book, Prothero asserts that Meyer, not a paleontologist nor a molecular biologist, does not understand these scientific disciplines, therefore he misinterprets, distorts and confuses the data, all for the purpose of promoting the 'God of the gaps' argument: 'anything that is currently not easily explained by science is automatically attributed to supernatural causes', i.e. intelligent design. In his article \\"Doubting 'Darwin's Doubt'\\" published in The New Yorker, Gareth Cook says that this book is another attempt by the creationist to rekindle the intelligent design movement. Decades of fossil discovery around the world, aided by new computational analytical techniques enable scientists to construct a more complete portrait of the tree of life which was not available to Darwin (hence his \\"doubt\\" in Meyer's words). The contemporary scientific consensus is that there was no \\"explosion\\". Cook cites Nick Matzke's analysis that the major gaps identified by Meyer are derived from his lack of understanding of the field's key statistical techniques (among other things) and his misleading rearrangement of the tree of life. Cook references scientific literature to refute Meyer's argument that the genetic machinery of life is incapable of big leaps therefore any major biological advancement must be the result of intervention by the 'intelligent designer'. Like Prothero, Cook also criticizes Meyer's proposal that if something cannot be fully explained by today's science, it must be the work of a supreme deity. Calling it a 'masterwork of pseudoscience', Cook warns that the influence of this book should not be underestimated. Cook opines that the book, with Meyer sewing skillfully together the trappings of science, wielding his credential of a Ph.D. (in history of science) from the University of Cambridge, writing in a seemingly serious and reasonable manner, will appeal to a large audience who is hungry for material evidence of God or considers science a conspiracy against spirituality. From a different perspective, paleontologist Charles Marshall wrote in his review \\"When Prior Belief Trumps Scholarship\\" published in Science that while trying to build the scientific case for intelligent design, Meyer allows his deep belief to steer his understanding and interpretation of the scientific data and fossil records collected for the Cambrian period. The result (this book) is selective knowledge (scholarship) that is plagued with misrepresentation, omission, and dismissal of the scientific consensus; exacerbated by Meyer's lack of scientific knowledge and superficial understanding in the relevant fields, especially molecular phylogenetics and morphogenesis. The main argument of Meyer is the mathematically impossible time scale that is needed to support emergence of new genes which drive the explosion of new species during the Cambrian period. Marshall points out that the relatively fast appearance of new animal species in this period is not driven by new genes, but rather by evolving from existing genes through \\"rewiring\\" of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). This basis of morphogenesis is dismissed by Meyer due to his fixation on novel genes and new protein folds as prerequisite of emergence of new species. The root of his bias is his \\"God of the gaps\\" approach to knowledge and the sentimental quest to \\"provide solace to those who feel their faith undermined by secular society and by science in particular\\".

Launched in time for the 2001 Christmas season, the T68 was the first Ericsson mobile phone to have a colour screen, a passive LCD-STN with a resolution of 101√ó80 and 256 colours. Despite its diminute size (3.94√ó1.89√ó0.79 in or 100√ó48√ó20 mm, 2.96 oz or 84 g), it was one of the most feature-rich mobile phones at the time, with Bluetooth, IrDA port, GPRS 3+1, tri-band compatibility (900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz), SMS with T9 (predictive text), EMS, WAP, and customizable monophonic ring tones. A simple bitmap image editor was provided, allowing the creation of monochrome pictures by guiding a cursor around the canvas and setting or unsetting individual pixels (several 'brush' sizes were selectable to make this easier). These images could be set as the phone's background image in standby mode, and sent to owners of EMS-compliant phones. With EMS soon to be succeeded by the superior MMS, few owners made much use of this feature. At its release, the phone cost around ‚Ç¨ 500, GBP299 in the UK, in either two-tone grey or all-gold. In 2002, after a slight cosmetic redesign and a software upgrade, the T68m was re-released as the Sony Ericsson T68i, as by then Ericsson had created a joint venture with Sony Corporation to produce mobile phones as Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications. The upgrade, also available to owners of the T68, provided a built-in e-mail client, SyncML support, and, for the first time ever, two-way MMS with full SMIL implementation. The underlying hardware remained unchanged. The T68i is known for being a highly effective example of stealth marketing. Before being released Sony Ericsson paid actors to pretend to be tourists and asked people to take pictures of them with the T68i. The previously included Tetris game was not present in the firmware of the T68i. A camera was not present, which was sold as an add-on (MCA-25 CommuniCam) and, at the end of the model life cycle, was offered with the phone. Calendar Items, Wallpaper Images, Screensaver Images, Pictures of Senders, and Ringtones can be sent to the T68i through the Bluetooth protocol, or infrared. The T68i was the first Ericsson (Sony) free from brominated flame retardants (BFR).

It was launched on February 1, 1989 as the second commercial television channel in Belgium after the French-speaking RTL-TVI, and quickly became the most popular TV channel in the Flemish part of Belgium. Early programming consisted of local versions of game shows like 'Rad Van Fortuin' (Wheel of Fortune) or 'Waagstuk!' (Jeopardy!). The channel is also considered to have been instrumental in the rebirth of the local music industry as it was the first TV channel to promote local music through its primetime TV show 'Tien om te zien' (Ten to see), a weekly chart show with only local music productions. The channel's focus on local music and local versions of international TV formats quickly allowed it to outperform public television in 1989 and the early 1990s. Average marketshare went up to over 40% in 1993. Currently VTM is still the Flemish commercial market leader and the 2nd biggest channel in Flanders. It can be received on cable, digital cable, IPTV in Flanders and Belgium and by satellite in Europe. Parent company DPG Group also operates sister channels, including VTMKzoom (children's), as well as Q2 and Vitaya. Many programs originally aired on VTM may later rerun on these other channels. The broadcaster also owns two radio stations: Q-music and JOEfm. It also formerly owned the now defunct Radio BemBem. In 2005 there were talks about MEDIALAAN, VTM's former owner, buying the Flemish part of Canal Plus from Telenet but this fell through. In 2006 rumours spread that the RTL Group would buy 50% of MEDIALAAN, but VTM as well as RTL denied those plans. In 2004, VTM lost its market dominance back to the public broadcaster VRT's flagship channel √©√©n. After its big rebrand in 2008 and the latest smaller rebrand in 2012, VTM regained strength with popular shows.

As a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, he commanded HMS Chatham as part of the Vancouver Expedition, a voyage of exploration through the Pacific Ocean led by Captain George Vancouver in the early 1790s. Personal life William Robert Broughton was born on 22 March 1762.J. K. Laughton, 'Broughton, William Robert, naval officer, (1762‚Äì1821)', rev. Roger Morriss, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 29 December 2015 His father, Charles Broughton, was a Hamburg merchant and his mother, Anne Elizabeth, was the daughter of Baron William de Hertoghe. Broughton married his cousin, Jemima, on 26 November 1802. They had four children. On 12 March 1821, while in Florence, Broughton suffered an angina attack and died two days later. He was buried in the English burial ground in Leghorn. Early career Broughton's name was added to the muster of the yacht Catherine on 1 May 1774, as captain's servant but Broughton first went to sea on 18 November when he joined the 10-gun brig-sloop, Falcon which sailed for North America, under the command of Captain John Linzee. On 14 February 1777, Broughton, by then a midshipman, transferred to Harlem under Lieutenant John Knight. He was appointed to the 64-gun Eagle on 1 July 1778, then in December he joined the seventy-four, Superb as a Master's mate and began service in the East Indies. On 12 January 1782, Broughton was promoted to lieutenant aboard the 68-gun Burford commanded by Captain Peter Rainier. When Burford paid off on 19 July 1784, Broughton went ashore and did not serve again for almost four years. Broughton resumed his career on 23 June 1788, aboard the 18-gun sloop, Orestes, under Manley Dixon, serving in The Channel and later, the Mediterranean. On 13 May 1790, he moved to and renewed his acquaintance with John Knight, her captain. Broughton's first command came on 18 December when he was given command of the brig, Chatham and asked to accompany George Vancouver in his exploration of the north-west Pacific. Vancouver Expedition En route to the Pacific Northwest the expedition spent some time exploring the South Pacific and whilst sailing separately from Vancouver, in November 1791, Broughton and his crew became the first Europeans to sight both The Snares and the Chatham Islands on the 23rd and 29th respectively. The former group contains an island that still bears Broughton's name. Sometime after their arrival in North America, in 1792, Broughton was given the task of charting a group of islands in the Queen Charlotte Sound. In his honour, Vancouver named them the Broughton Archipelago. In October, Broughton was ordered to explore the lower stretches of the Columbia River, between present- day Oregon and Washington.Jim Mockford, \\"The Journal of a Tour across the Continent of New Spain from St. Blas in the North Pacific Ocean to La Vera Cruz in the Gulph of Mexico, by Lieut. W. R. Broughton in the Year 1793, Commander H.M. Brig 'Chatham'\\", Terrae Incognitae, vol.36, 2004, pp.2‚Äì58. With several boats from his ship, Broughton and his party navigated upstream as far as the Columbia River Gorge and on 30 October, he reached his farthest point, landing in eastern Multnomah County east of Portland and northwest of Mount Hood, which he named for Viscount Samuel Hood, Admiral of the British Fleet. Late in 1792, Vancouver, stymied by conflicting instructions over Nootka Sound, sent Broughton back to England via Mexico and the Atlantic, bearing dispatches and requesting instructions. Exploring Japan and Sakhalin On 3 October 1793, Broughton was promoted to commander and given command of , a ship formerly commanded by Captain William Bligh. The fitting out caused a long delay and the ship didn't sail until February 1795 and when Broughton finally returned to north-west America, he was unable to locate Vancouver. Correctly determining that Vancouver had returned to England having completed his survey, Broughton crossed the Pacific and began a four-year survey of the Asian coast between the latitudes of 35 and 52 degrees north, which would include, the Kurile Islands, Japan, Okinawa, and Formosa. From September 1796 Broughton charted the east coast of Honshu and Hokkaid≈ç before wintering at Macau where he purchased a small schooner to assist the Providence. Next year he returned to Japan where the Providence was wrecked on what was to become known as Providence Reef, now Yabiji (ÂÖ´ÈáçÂπ≤ÁÄ¨), at Miyako Island. The schooner saved the crew of the wrecked ship and they continued north along the east coast of Honshu. Passing Hokkaido, the expedition sailed north into the Gulf of Tartary along the west coast of Sakhalin. Finding extensive shallows at the north end of the gulf it was falsely concluded that Sakhalin was part of the mainland (a common mistake). Broughton turned south along the coast of Korea and then headed home by way of Trincomalee, Ceylon, where the crew was paid off and he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship. Having been acquitted, he reached England in February 1799 and shortly after began to write his book, \\"A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean; in which the coast of Asia, from the latitude of 35¬∞ north to the latitude of 52¬∞ north, the island of Insu (commonly known under the name of Jesso), the north, south and east coasts of Japan, the Lieuchieux and adjacent islands, as well as the coast of Corea, have been examined and surveyed, Performed in His Majesty's Sloop Providence and her tender, in the years 1795, 1796, 1797, 1798\\". It was published in 1804. Later career Having been kept from the greater part of the French Revolutionary War by his book, Broughton resumed his active naval career on 23 June 1801, when he was given command of the 50-gun Batavier in The Channel. He served aboard her until the Peace of Amiens was ratified, in April 1802. In May, Broughton was given command of the 36-gun Penelope, serving in the North Sea, an appointment that lasted until two days before his next command, the seventy-four, Illustrious, on 30 May 1807. In her, Broughton continued service, seeing action at the Battle of the Basque Roads. After the battle, Lord Cochrane proclaimed that Admiral Gambier had not done enough to destroy the French fleet and Gambier demanded a court martial at which he was acquitted, despite Broughton speaking out against him. In November 1810, Broughton, still in command of Illustrious, took part in the Mauritius Campaign, joining a fleet off the island of Rodriquez, under Vice- admiral Albermarle Bertie. On 29 November, this fleet landed around 10,000 troops at Grande-Baie, north-east of Port-Louis, on the Isle de France which capitulated five days later on 3 December. In 1811, Broughton took part in the Java Expedition. He was initially given command of the expedition by Admiral O'Bryen Drury the then Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies but he was relieved of his post after Drury's death by Admiral Robert Stopford, who had arrived from the Cape. This angered Broughton, who felt that Stopford had exceeded his authority, and who applied for a court-martial, which was ultimately rejected. The mission however was a success, the British having complete control of the island by 18 September 1811. Broughton resigned his commission on 23 October 1812 but was recalled on 31 May 1815 to serve in the channel as commander of the 100-gun Royal Sovereign. In August 1815 he transferred to Spencer, a seventy-four, serving as a guardship at Plymouth. On 4 June 1815, Broughton was made a Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath and promoted to Colonel of the Marines on 12 March 1819. Death and legacy Broughton died in Florence, Italy in 1821, and was buried in the Old English Cemetery, Livorno.

Its mission is to preserve Mono Lake, by reducing diversions of water from the Eastern Sierra watersheds by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). Mono Lake Mono Lake is an alkaline lake east of Yosemite National Park, largely fed by streams from the Sierra Nevada; it has no natural outlet. In 1919 the level of the lake peaked at 6427' above sea level. Birds bred and nested on a few volcanic islands in the lake, sustained by the extensive brine shrimp and alkali flies, which also attracted large numbers of migratory birds. In 1941, the LAWDP began redirecting water from the streams feeding Mono Lake into the Los Angeles Aqueduct. As time passed, this both reduced the level of the lake and dried out the lower sections of the source streams. By 1981 the level of the lake had been reduced to 6372' above sea level, with the lake's volume cut in half, and its salinity doubled. Negit Island, a breeding site for birds, developed a land bridge and became susceptible to land-based predators such as coyotes. Formation of the Mono Lake Committee The Committee was founded in 1978 by David Gaines, David Winkler, and Sally Judy. In 1975, David Winkler, Jefferson Burch, and Christine Weigen obtained a grant, with help and encouragement from David Gaines, from the NSF to study the ecology of Mono Lake. He had found that, starting in 1941, LADWP's diversions of water from Mono Lake's inflow creeks had caused it to lose half its volume and double its salinity. These changes, Gaines reported, reduced the ability of the lake to support its saline ecosystem. Mono Lake is an important habitat for migratory birds (including the California gull). The lowering of the water level endangered the bird nesting grounds on Negit Island in the middle of the lake: a land bridge had formed, which allowed predators to attack the bird nests. LADWP Lawsuit In 1979, the MLC, along with the Audubon Society filed suit in Mono County, California Superior Court, claiming that LADWP's water diversions violated the public trust doctrine: that all navigable water must be managed for the benefit of everyone. In 1983, MLC won the argument in front of the California Supreme Court, who directed that the public trust doctrine overrides prior water rights. Bruce Dodge, of Morrison and Foerster, served as the pro-bono attorney in the case. Eventually, multiple litigations were adjudicated in 1994, by the California State Water Resources Control Board. In that ruling, LADWP was required to let enough water into Mono Lake to raise the lake level above the then-current level of below the 1941 level. As of 2018, the water level in Mono Lake has risen of the required . Los Angeles made up for the lost water through state-funded conservation and recycling projects. Current Status and Activities The Mono Lake Committee currently monitors the status of the lake and the compliance of the LAWDP with the court decision, supports scientific research in the Mono Lake region, and is actively working on restoring the incoming stream environments. They also provide extensive educational activities to schools and the general public, and maintain an office, information center, and bookstore in Lee Vining, CA that also serves as the Lee Vining Chamber of Commerce.

The RRB serves U.S. railroad workers and their families, and administers retirement, survivor, unemployment, and sickness benefits. Consequently, railroad workers do not participate in the United States Social Security program. The RRB's headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois, with field offices throughout the country. In connection with the retirement program, the RRB has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit payments and railroad workers' Medicare coverage. During fiscal year 2009, retirement survivor benefits of some $10.5 billion were paid to about 589,000 beneficiaries, while net unemployment-sickness benefits of $160 million, including over $10 million in temporary extended unemployment benefits under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, were paid to more than 40,000 claimants. At the end of fiscal year 2018, the average annuity paid to career rail employees was $3,525 per month, the average annuity paid for all retired rail employees was $2,815 per month, and the average retirement benefit under Social Security was $1,415 per month. Railroad retirement benefit payments are financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by railroad employers and their employees. Since 2002, funds not needed immediately for benefit payments or administrative expenses have been invested by an independent National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust, which qualifies as non profit 501(c)(28). As of September 30, 2009, Trust-managed assets and RRB assets held in reserve totaled almost $25 billion. History The assignment, furlough, and recall of most railroad employees was based on seniority. When work became scarce, employees with the least seniority were the first to be laid-off. The majority of railroaders were covered by pension plans, but private pension payments could be reduced if revenues were down, and many had been cut drastically by 1934. This practice created a conflict between older employees, who preferred the certainty of a paycheck to an unreliable pension, and younger employees, who saw opportunity for increased job security if superannuated workers could be induced to retire by guaranteeing them a decent pension. Railroad workers formed an association to agitate for government action. The Department of Labor proposed its own plan in response, eventually compromising with the workers to produce the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934. This legislation anticipated the Social Security Act of 1935, which covered most other employees, and was tailored to address the specific concerns of railroad workers. The Act was soon found unconstitutional, but President Roosevelt intervened to push for a lasting compromise. This pressure resulted in the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935, which set up a staff retirement plan providing annuities based on an employee‚Äôs creditable railroad earnings and service, and Railroad Retirement and Carrier Taxing Acts of 1937, which made railroad employees the only private-sector workers outside the Social Security system to have a separate, federally administered pension plan. More than 95,000 elderly and disabled railroad employees applied for pension benefits by the end of 1937.How Railroad Retirement Works Publications International, Ltd., the Editors of. \\"The Railroad Retirement Board.\\" 18 April 2008. HowStuffWorks.com. February, 6th 2010. Since passage of the Railroad Retirement Acts of the 1930s, numerous other railroad laws have subsequently been enacted. While the railroad retirement system has remained separate from the social security system, the two systems are closely coordinated with regard to earnings credits, benefit payments, and taxes. The financing of the two systems is linked through a financial interchange under which, in effect, the portion of railroad retirement annuities that is equivalent to social security benefits is coordinated with the social security system. The purpose of this financial coordination is to place the social security trust funds in the same position they would be in if railroad service were covered by the social security program instead of the railroad retirement program. Legislation enacted in 1974 restructured railroad retirement benefits into two tiers, so as to coordinate them more fully with social security benefits. The first tier is based on combined railroad retirement and social security credits, using social security benefit formulas. The second tier is based on railroad service only and is comparable to the pensions paid over and above social security benefits in other industries. The railroad unemployment insurance system was also established in the 1930s. The Great Depression demonstrated the need for unemployment compensation programs, and state unemployment programs had been established under the Social Security Act in 1935. While the state unemployment programs generally covered railroad workers, railroad operations which crossed state lines caused special problems. Unemployed railroad workers were denied compensation by one state because their employers had paid unemployment taxes in another state. Although there were cases where employees appeared to be covered in more than one state, they often did not qualify in any. A federal study commission, which reported on the nationwide state plans for unemployment insurance, recommended that railroad workers be covered by a separate plan because of the complications their coverage had caused the state plans. Congress subsequently enacted the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act in June 1938. The Act established a system of benefits for unemployed railroaders, financed entirely by railroad employers and administered by the RRB. Sickness benefits were added in 1946. Railroad Retirement Act Under the Railroad Retirement Act, retirement and disability annuities are paid to railroad workers with at least 10 years of service. Such annuities are also payable to workers with 5 years of service if performed after 1995. =Provisions= Full age annuities are payable at age 60 to workers with 30 years of service. For those with less than 30 years of service, reduced annuities are payable at age 62 and unreduced annuities are payable at full retirement age, which is gradually rising from 65 to 67, depending on the year of birth. Disability annuities can be paid on the basis of total or occupational disability. Annuities are also payable to spouses and divorced spouses of retired workers and to widow(er)s, surviving divorced spouses, remarried widow(er)s, children, and parents of deceased railroad workers. Qualified railroad retirement beneficiaries are covered by Medicare in the same way as social security beneficiaries. As noted, the RRB pays retirement annuities to employees, as well as their spouses and/or divorced spouses, if the employee had at least 10 years of railroad service, or 5 years if performed after 1995. However, for survivor benefits, there is an additional requirement that the employee‚Äôs last regular employment before retirement or death was in the railroad industry. If a railroad employee or his or her survivors do not qualify for railroad retirement benefits, the RRB transfers the employee‚Äôs railroad retirement credits to the Social Security Administration, where they are treated as social security credits. =Financing= Payroll taxes paid by railroad employers and their employees are the primary source of funding for the railroad retirement-survivor benefit programs. Railroad retirement taxes, which have historically been higher than social security taxes, are calculated, like benefit payments, on a two-tier basis. Railroad retirement tier I payroll taxes are coordinated with social security taxes so that employees and employers pay tier I taxes at the same rate as social security taxes. In addition, both employees and employers pay tier II taxes which are used to finance railroad retirement benefit payments over and above social security levels. These tier II taxes are based on the ratio of certain asset balances to the sum of benefit payments and administrative expenses. Revenues in excess of benefit payments are invested to provide additional trust fund income. The National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust manages and invests railroad retirement assets. Railroad retirement funds are invested in non-governmental assets, as well as in governmental securities. Additional trust fund income is derived from the financial interchange with the social security trust funds, revenues from federal income taxes on railroad retirement benefits, and appropriations from general treasury revenues provided after 1974 as part of a phase-out of certain vested dual benefits. Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act Under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, unemployment insurance benefits are paid to railroad workers who are unemployed but ready, willing, and able to work and sickness benefits to railroad workers who are unable to work because of illness or injury. The RRB also operates a placement service to assist unemployed railroaders in securing employment. =Benefit Year= A new unemployment-sickness benefit year begins every July 1, with eligibility generally based on railroad service and earnings in the preceding calendar year. Up to 26 weeks of normal unemployment or sickness benefits are payable to an individual in a benefit year. Additional extended benefits are payable to persons with 10 or more years of service. =Financing= The railroad unemployment-sickness benefit program is financed by taxes on railroad employers under an experience-rating system. Each employer's payroll tax rate is determined annually by the RRB on the basis of benefit payments to the railroad's employees. Organization and functions The Railroad Retirement Board is headed by three members appointed by the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate. One member is appointed upon the recommendation of railroad employers, one is appointed upon the recommendation of railroad labor organizations and the third, who is the Chairman, is appointed to represent the public interest. The Board Members' terms of office are five years and are scheduled to expire in different years. The President also appoints an Inspector General for the RRB. The primary function of the RRB is the determination and payment of benefits under the retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness programs. To this end, the RRB employs field representatives to assist railroad personnel and their families in filing claims for benefits, examiners to adjudicate the claims, and information technology staff, equipment and programs to maintain earnings records, calculate benefits and process payments. The RRB also employs actuaries to predict the future income and outlays of the railroad retirement system, statisticians and economists to provide vital data, and attorneys to interpret legislation and represent the RRB in litigation. The Inspector General employs auditors and investigators to detect any waste, fraud, or abuse in the benefit programs. Long Island Rail Road disability controversy In contrast to the single disability program offered by Social Security, Railroad Retirement offers two types of disability annuities. The Total Disability, or \\"Disability Freeze\\", is based on guidelines similar to Social Security Disability. The Occupational Disability only requires that applicants possess certain ailments which are deemed by law as an inability for them to safely perform their particular regular job. Railroad employees applying for either disability annuity must end any compensated service within 90 days from the date of filing. Employees either quit their jobs, retire or exhaust sick benefits before applying for either disability. Because of this requirement and the work restrictions while receiving a disability annuity, most annuitants had worked for carriers that already awarded them private company pensions. In 2008, more than 90 percent of Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) retirees were receiving occupational disability payments.A Disability Epidemic Among a Railroad‚Äôs Retirees New York Times, 20 September 2008 A former LIRR pension department manager was arrested and charged with official misconduct for allegedly \\"taking money to help railroad employees find a doctor and fill out paperwork for federal disability payments\\".Ex-Manager Charged in L.I.R.R.

In October of that year, the Board voted to strengthen its oversight of disability pensions.International Business Times US Railroad Retirement Board approves reforms A report produced in September 2009 by the U. S. Government Accountability Office disclosed that five federal agencies which investigated and audited the disability awards found no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing by either the Railroad Retirement Board or the retirees who applied for those awards. Its investigation did state, however, that \\"a nearly 100-percent approval rate in a federal disability program is troubling, and could indicate lax internal controls in the Board's decision- making process, weaknesses in program design, or both.\\" The report found no fraud or wrongdoing, but noted that in \\"prior work, we found that numerous claims with evidence from the same doctors can be an indicator of potential fraud or abuse\\"; unlike sister agency Metro-North Railroad, LIRR disability evidence was provided primarily by one of three doctors. In March 2010, the New York Attorney General's Office announced that LIRR had agreed to appoint an independent examiner and implement other reforms to address abuses of the occupational disability benefits by its retirees and to help ensure that benefits are available only to those who truly are disabled. Another additional 11 federal arrests occurred on October 27, 2011, including two doctors and a former union official.NBC New York, 2011 Oct 27 11 Charged in Massive LIRR Disability Pension Scandal In September 2012, four LIRR retirees pleaded guilty to fraud.Two More Plead Guilty in LIRR Pension Fraud Newsday, Sept 19, 2012 10:28 PM, By JOHN RILEY In February 2014, physician Peter J.

It is traditionally ascribed to the bard Aneirin and survives only in one manuscript, the Book of Aneirin. The Book of Aneirin manuscript is from the later 13th century, but Y Gododdin has been dated to between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh. The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably in the Hen Ogledd (\\"Old North\\"); as such it would have been written in the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic.Elliott (2005), p. 583.Jackson (1969)‚Äîthe work is titled The Gododdin: the oldest Scottish poem. Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th, 10th, or 11th century. Even a 9th-century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry. The Gododdin, known in Roman times as the Votadini, held territories in what is now southeast Scotland and Northumberland, part of the Hen Ogledd. The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative. The manuscript contains several stanzas which have no connection with the Gododdin and are considered to be interpolations. One stanza in particular has received attention because it mentions King Arthur in passing, which, if not an interpolation, would be the earliest known reference to that character. Book of Aneirin =Manuscript= Only one early manuscript of Y Gododdin is known, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from the second half of the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem,The manuscript separates stanzas by the use of large capitals, but does not separate the text into lines. The arrangement used by most editors follows that used by Ifor Williams in his 1938 edition. then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau.Klar, O Hehir and Sweetser considered that a third scribe, whom they called C, wrote the text of the Gorchanau. This view is disputed by Huws, who considers that these were the work of Scribe A. See Huws, pp. 34, 48 This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A, while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.Jarman (1998), p.xiv Differences exist within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material show signs of partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder shows much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, but after a while tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas as they were in the older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2.Koch (1997), p. lxvi If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources. =Poem= Edinburgh Castle viewed from Princes Street: Around 600 AD, this may have been the site of the hall of Mynyddog Mwynfawr, where the warriors feasted before setting forth to battle. The stanzas that make up the poemO Hehir considers that Y Gododdin is better understood as a collection of poems on related topics. See O Hehir, p. 66 are a series of elegies for warriors who fell in battle against vastly superior numbers. Some of the verses refer to the entire host, and others eulogize individual heroes. They tell how the ruler of the Gododdin, Mynyddog Mwynfawr, gathered warriors from several Brythonic kingdoms and provided them with a year's feasting and drinking mead in his halls at Din Eidyn, before launching a campaign in which almost all of them were killed fighting against overwhelming odds.One stanza mentions 100,000 of the enemy, another mentions a ratio of 180 for each one of the warriors of the Gododdin. The poetry is based on a fixed number of syllables, though some irregularity occurs, which may be due to modernisation of the language during oral transmission. It uses rhyme, both end-rhyme and internal, and some parts use alliteration. A number of stanzas may open with the same words, for example \\"Gwyr a aeth gatraeth gan wawr\\" (\\"Men went to Catraeth at dawn\\"). The collection appears to have been compiled from two different versions: according to some verses, there were 300 men of the Gododdin, and only one, Cynon ap Clydno, survived; others have 363 warriors and three survivors, in addition to the poet, who as a bard, almost certainly would not have been counted as one of the warriors. The names of about 80 warriors are given in the poem.The names are listed in Jarman (1998), pp. xxx‚Äìxxxi The Book of Aneirin begins with the introduction Hwn yw e gododin. Aneirin ae cant (\\"This is the Gododdin; Aneirin sang it\\"). The first stanza appears to be a reciter's prologue, composed after the death of Aneirin: The second stanza praises an individual hero: Other stanzas praise the entire host, for example number 13: Mead is mentioned in many stanzas, sometimes with the suggestion that it is linked to their deaths. This led some 19th-century editors to assume that the warriors went into battle drunk,This idea goes back at least to Turner in 1803. however Williams explained that \\"mead\\" here stood for everything the warriors received from their lord. In return, they were expected to \\"pay their mead\\" by being loyal to their lord unto death. A similar concept is found in Anglo-Saxon poetry.Williams (1938), pp. xlviii- xlvix. The heroes commemorated in the poem are mounted warriors; there are many references to horses in the poem. There are references to spears, swords and shields, and to the use of armour (llurug, from the Latin lorica).Williams (1938), pp. lxii‚Äìlxiii. There are several references which indicate that they were Christians, for example \\"penance\\" and \\"altar\\", while the enemy are described as \\"heathens\\". Several of these features can be seen in stanza 33: However, D. Simon Evans has suggested that most, if not all, of the references which point to Christianity may be later additions.Evans (1977), p. 44. Many personal names are given, but only two are recorded in other sources. One of the warriors was Cynon ap Clydno, whom Williams identifies with the Cynon ap Clydno Eiddin who is mentioned in old pedigrees.Williams, p. 175. The other personal name recorded in other sources is Arthur. If the mention of Arthur formed part of the original poem this could be the earliest reference to Arthur, as a paragon of bravery.Jarman in his 1988 edition lists the stanza as a possible interpolation. Koch in his 1997 study considers the stanza as probably archaic, before 638. Within the stanza, the reference to Arthur is proved by the rhyme. See Koch (1997), pp. 147‚Äì8. In stanza 99, the poet praises one of the warriors, Gwawrddur: Many of the warriors were not from the lands of the Gododdin. Among the places mentioned are Aeron, thought to be the area around the River Ayr and Elfed, the area around Leeds still called Elmet. Others came from further afield, for example one came from \\"beyond Bannog\\", a reference to the mountains between Stirling (thought to have been Manaw Gododdin territory) and Dumbarton (chief fort of the Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde) ‚Äì this warrior must have come from Pictland. Others came from Gwynedd in north Wales.Jackson (1969), pp. 5‚Äì7. =Interpolations= Three of the stanzas included in the manuscript have no connection with the subject matter of the remainder except that they are also associated with southern Scotland or northern England rather than Wales. One of these is a stanza which celebrates the victory of the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde under Eugein I, here described as \\"the grandson of Neithon\\", over Domnall Brecc (\\"Dyfnwal Frych\\" in Welsh), king of D√°l Riata, at the Battle of Strathcarron in 642: Another stanza appears to be part of the separate cycle of poems associated with Llywarch Hen. The third interpolation is a poem entitled \\"Dinogad's Smock\\", a cradle-song addressed to a baby named Dinogad, describing how his father goes hunting and fishing.Jarman (1998), pp. lxi‚Äìlxiii. The interpolations are thought to have been added to the poem after it had been written down, these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in the manuscript, then being incorporated in the poem by a later copier who failed to realise that they did not belong. The Strathcarron stanza, for example, is the first stanza in the B text of the Book of Aneirin, and Jackson suggested that it had probably been inserted on a blank space at the top of the first page of the original manuscript.Jackson (1969), p. 48. According to Koch's reconstruction, this stanza was deliberately added to the text in Strathclyde. Analysis and interpretation =Date= The date of Y Gododdin has been the subject of debate among scholars since the early 19th century.Turner (1803), pp. iii‚Äìiv. If the poem was composed soon after the battle, it must predate 638, when the fall of Din Eidyn was recorded in the reign of Oswy king of Bernicia, an event which is thought to have meant the collapse of the kingdom of the Gododdin.Jackson (1969), p. 10. If it is a later composition, the latest date which could be ascribed to it is determined by the orthography of the second part of Scribe B's text. This is usually considered to be that of the 9th or 10th centuries, although some scholars consider that it could be from the 11th century.Evans (1982), p. 17. Most of the debate about the date of the poem has employed linguistic arguments, mostly concerning rhyme (since more is known about early Welsh phonology than other aspects of the language, like syntax). It is believed that around the time of the battle, the British language was transitioning into its daughter languages: the primitive form of Welsh in Wales, of Cornish and Breton in southwestern Britain and Brittany, and Cumbric in northern Britain.Davies (2005), p. 232. Kenneth Jackson concludes that the majority of the changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the 5th to the end of the 6th century.Jackson (1953), pp 3‚Äì11; 690. This involved syncope and the loss of final syllables. If the poem dates to this time, it would have been written in an early form of Cumbric, the usual name for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd. Jackson suggested the name \\"Primitive Cumbric\\" for the dialect spoken at the time.Jackson (1969), pp. 86, 90 Sweetser gives the example of the name Cynfelyn found in the Gododdin; in British this would have been Cunobelinos. The middle unstressed o and the final unstressed os have been lost.Sweetser (1988), p. 140. Ifor Williams, whose 1938 text laid the foundations for modern scholarly study of the poetry, considered that part of it could be regarded as being of likely late 6th- century origin. This would have been orally transmitted for a period before being written down.Williams (1938), pp. xc‚Äìxciii. Dillon cast doubt on the date of composition, arguing that it is unlikely that by the end of the 6th century Primitive Welsh would have developed into a language \\"not notably earlier than that of the ninth century\\". He suggests that the poetry may have been composed in the 9th century on traditional themes and attributed to Aneirin.Dillon (1973), pp. 267‚Äì8. Jackson however considers that there is \\"no real substance\\" in these arguments, and points out that the poetry would have been transmitted orally for a long period before being written down, and would have been modernised by reciters, and that there is in any case nothing in the language used which would rule out a date around 600.Jackson (1969) pp. 88‚Äì91 Koch suggests a rather earlier date, about 570, and also suggests that the poem may have existed in written form by the 7th century, much earlier than usually thought. Koch, reviewing the arguments about the date of the poetry in 1997, states: Koch himself believes that a considerable part of the poem can be dated to the 6th century. Greene in 1971 considered that the language of the poem was 9th-century rather than 6th-century,Greene (1971), pp. 1‚Äì11. and Isaac, writing in 1999, stated that the linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating the poem as a whole before the 9th or 10th century.Isaac 1999, pp. 55‚Äì78. The other approach to dating the poetry has been to look at it from a historical point of view. Charles-Edwards writing in 1978 concluded that: Dumville, commenting on these attempts to establish the historicity of the poem in 1988, said, \\"The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven; but that does not mean that it cannot be.\\"Dumville (1998), p. 8. Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'.Patrick Sims-Williams, 'Dating the Poems of Aneirin and Taliesin', Zeitschrift f√ºr celtische Philologie, 63 (2016), 163‚Äì234 (p. 217), DOI: 10.1515/zcph-2016-0008, September 2016. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later \\"forgeries\\" have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty.Jarman (1998), p. lxix. Breeze comments, \\"it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten\\".Breeze (1997), p. 14. =Background= The Gododdin and neighbouring kingdoms The poem is set in the area which is now southern Scotland and north-east England. Around the year 600 this area included a number of Brythonic kingdoms. Apart from the Gododdin, the kingdom of Alt Clut occupied the Strathclyde area and Rheged covered parts of Galloway, Lancashire and Cumbria. Further south lay the kingdom of Elmet in the Leeds area. These areas made up what was later known in Welsh as Yr Hen Ogledd (The Old North). The Gododdin, known as the Votadini in the Romano-British period, occupied a territory from the area around the head of the Firth of Forth as far south as the River Wear. In modern terms their lands included much of Clackmannanshire and the Lothian and Borders regions. Their capital at this period may have been called Din Eidyn, now known as Edinburgh. By this time the area that later became Northumbria had been invaded and increasingly occupied by the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia.Jackson (1969), pp. 5‚Äì9. In the Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, there is a reference to several poets in this area during the 6th century. Having mentioned Ida of Bernicia, the founder of the Northumbrian royal line who ruled between 547 and 559, the Historia goes on to say: Nothing has been preserved of the work of Talhaearn, Blwchfardd and Cian, but poems attributed to Taliesin were published by Ifor Williams in Canu Taliesin and were considered by him to be comparable in antiquity to the Gododdin. This poetry praises Urien of Rheged and his son Owain, and refers to Urien as lord of Catraeth.Williams (1972), p. 49. =Interpretation= Y Gododdin is not a narrative poem but a series of elegies for heroes who died in a battle whose history would have been familiar to the original listeners. The context of the poem has to be worked out from the text itself. There have been various interpretations of the events recorded in the poem. The 19th-century Welsh scholar Thomas Stephens identified the Gododdin with the Votadini and Catraeth as Catterick in North Yorkshire.Stephens (1876),p. 3 He linked the poem to the Battle of Degsastan in c. 603 between King √Üthelfrith of Bernicia and the Gaels under √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in, king of D√°l Riada. Gwenogvryn Evans in his 1922 edition and translation of the Book of Aneirin claimed that the poem referred to a battle around the Menai Strait in 1098, emending the text to fit the theory.Williams (1972), pp. 58‚Äì9. The generally accepted interpretation for the Battle of Catraeth is that put forward by Ifor Williams in his Canu Aneirin first published in 1938. Williams interpreted mynydawc mwynvawr in the text to refer to a person, Mynyddog Mwynfawr in modern Welsh. Mynyddog, in his version, was the king of the Gododdin, with his chief seat at Din Eidyn (modern Edinburgh). Around the year 600 Mynyddog gathered about 300 selected warriors, some from as far afield as Gwynedd. He feasted them at Din Eidyn for a year, then launched an attack on Catraeth, which Williams agrees with Stephens in identifying as Catterick, which was in Anglo-Saxon hands. They were opposed by a larger army from the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia.Williams, pp. xxiii‚Äìxlviii. The battle at Catraeth has been seen as an attempt to resist the advance of the Angles, who had probably by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria. This interpretation has been accepted by most modern scholars. Jackson accepts the interpretation but suggests that a force of 300 men would be much too small to undertake the task demanded of them. He considers that the 300 mounted warriors would have been accompanied by a larger number of foot soldiers, not considered worthy of mention in the poem.Jackson (1969), pp. 13‚Äì18. Jarman also follows Williams' interpretation.Jarman (1998), pp. xxi‚Äìxxiv. Jackson suggested that after the fall of the kingdom of Gododdin, in or about 638, the poem was preserved in Strathclyde, which maintained its independence for several centuries. He considers that it was first written down in Strathclyde after a period of oral transmission, and may have reached Wales in manuscript form between the end of the 8th and the end of the 9th century.Jackson (1969), pp. 63‚Äì7. There would be particular interest in matters relating to the Gododdin in Gwynedd, since the founding myth of the kingdom involved the coming of Cunedda Wledig from Manaw Gododdin. =Alternative interpretation= In 1997, John Koch published a new study of Y Gododdin which involved an attempt to reconstruct the original poetry written in what Koch terms \\"Archaic Neo-Brittonic\\". This work also included a new and very different interpretation of the background of the poetry. He draws attention to a poem in Canu Taliesin entitled Gweith Gwen Ystrat (The Battle of Gwen Ystrat): There is also a reference to Catraeth in the slightly later poem Moliant Cadwallon, a panegyric addressed to Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd, thought to have been composed in about 633.Woolf has recently suggested that the British king, Caedualla, who led a coalition including Penda of Mercia to overthrow and kill Edwin, king of Deira, was from northern England, rather than Gwynedd. However this would not affect Koch's argument here. Two lines in this poem are translated by Koch as \\"fierce Gwallawc wrought the great and renowned mortality at Catraeth\\". He identifies Gwallawc as the \\"Guallauc\\" who was one of the kings who fought against Bernicia in alliance with Urien. Koch draws attention to the mention of meibion Godebawc (the sons of Godebog) as an enemy in stanza 15 of the Gododdin and points out that according to old Welsh genealogies Urien and other Brittonic kings were descendants of \\"Co√Øl Hen Guotepauc\\".Koch (1997), pp. xxiii‚Äìxxv. He considers that, in view of the references in the three poems, there is a case for identifying the attack on Catraeth recorded in Y Gododdin with the Battle of Gwen Ystrat. This would date the poem to about 570 rather than the c. 600 favoured by Williams and others. He interprets the Gododdin as having fought the Brythons of Rheged and Alt Clut over a power struggle in Elmet, with Anglian allies on both sides, Rheged being in an alliance with Deira. He points out that according to the Historia Britonnum it was Rhun, son of Urien Rheged who baptized the princess Eanfl√¶d of Deira, her father Edwin and 12,000 of his subjects in 626/7.Koch (1997), p. xxxiii. Urien Rheged was thus the real victor of the battle. Mynyddog Mwynfawr was not a person's name but a personal description meaning 'mountain feast' or 'mountain chief'.Wmffre (2002) agrees that Mynyddog is not a personal name, but suggests that it is a reference to the Christian God. See Wmffre, pp. 83‚Äì105. Some aspects of Koch's view of the historical context have been criticised by both Oliver Padel and Tim Clarkson. Clarkson, for example, makes the point that the reference in Gweith Gwen Ystrat is to \\"the men of Catraeth\\"; it does not state that the battle was fought at Catraeth, and also that according to Bede it was Paulinus, not Rhun, who baptized the Deirans. Editions and translations The first known translation of Y Gododdin was by Evan Evans (\\"Ieuan Fardd\\") who printed ten stanzas with a Latin translation in his book Some Specimens of the Poetry of the Antient Welsh Bards published in 1764.Jarman (1998), p. lxxxii. The full text was printed for the first time by Owen Jones in the Myvyrian Archaiology in 1801. English translations of the poem were published by William Probert in 1820 and by John Williams (Ab Ithel) in 1852, followed by translations by William Forbes Skene in his Four Ancient Books of Wales (1866) and by Thomas Stephens for the Cymmrodorion Society in 1888. Gwenogvryn Evans produced a facsimile copy of the Book of Aneirin in 1908 and an edition with a translation in 1922. The first reliable edition was Canu Aneirin by Ifor Williams with notes in Welsh, published in 1938. New translations based on this work were published by Kenneth H. Jackson in 1969 and, with modernized Welsh text and glossary, by A.O.H. Jarman in 1988. A colour facsimile edition of the manuscript with an introduction by Daniel Huws was published by South Glamorgan County Council and the National Library of Wales in 1989. John Koch's new edition, which aimed to recreate the original text, appeared in 1997. There have also been a number of translations which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study. Examples are the translation by Joseph P. Clancy in The earliest Welsh poetry (1970) and Steve Short's 1994 translation. Cultural influence There are a number of references to Y Gododdin in later Medieval Welsh poetry. The well-known 12th-century poem Hirlas Owain by Owain Cyfeiliog, in which Owain praises his own war-band, likens them to the heroes of the Gododdin and uses Y Gododdin as a model. A slightly later poet, Dafydd Benfras, in a eulogy addressed to Llywelyn the Great, wishes to be inspired \\"to sing as Aneirin sang / The day he sang the Gododdin\\". After this period this poetry seems to have been forgotten in Wales for centuries until Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd) discovered the manuscript in the late 18th century. From the early 19th century onwards there are many allusions in Welsh poetry. In English, Y Gododdin was a major influence on the long poem In Parenthesis (1937) by David Jones, in which he reflects on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War.Jarman (1998), p.lxxxvi. Jones put a quotation from the Gododdin at the beginning of each of the seven sections of In Parenthesis. Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used Y Gododdin as the basis of his difficult but much-admired poem For the Fallen (1997), written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line 'Men went to Catraeth', using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of Y Gododdin are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheers‚Äôs Pink Mist (2012),https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571315574-pink-mist.html an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan; the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/26/pink-list-owen-sheers- review The poem has also inspired a number of historical novels, including Men Went to Cattraeth (1969) by John James, The Shining Company (1990) by Rosemary Sutcliff and The Amber Treasure (2009) by Richard J Denning. In 1989 the British industrial band Test Dept brought out an album entitled Gododdin, in which the words of the poem were set to music, part in the original and part in English translation. This was a collaboration with the Welsh avant-garde theatre company Brith Gof and was performed in Wales, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Scotland.Test Dept: a short history.

It is perhaps the least famous and celebrated of them.Friends of Nunhead Cemetery The cemetery is located in Nunhead in the London Borough of Southwark and was originally known as All Saints' Cemetery. Nunhead Cemetery was consecrated in 1840 and opened by the London Cemetery Company. It is a Local Nature Reserve. Location The Main Gate (North Gate) is located on Linden Grove (near the junction with Daniel's Road) and the South Gate is located on Limesford Road. The cemetery is in the London Borough of Southwark, SE15. History and description Consecrated in 1840, with an Anglican chapel designed by Thomas Little, it is one of the Magnificent Seven Victorian cemeteries established in a ring around what were then the outskirts of London. The first burial was of Charles Abbott, a 101-year-old Ipswich grocer; the last burial was of a volunteer soldier who became a canon of Lahore Cathedral.Nunhead Cemetery, BBC London, 21 July 2008. The first grave in Nunhead was dug in October 1840. The average annual number of burials over the ten years 1868‚Äì1878 was 1685: 1350 in the consecrated, and 335 in the unconsecrated ground. In the cemetery were reinterred remains removed, in 1867 and 1933, from the site of the demolished St Christopher le Stocks church in the City of London. The cemetery contains examples of the imposing monuments to the most eminent citizens of the day, which contrast sharply with the small, simple headstones marking common or public burials. By the middle of the 20th century the cemetery was nearly full, and so was abandoned by the United Cemetery Company. With the ensuing neglect, the cemetery gradually changed from lawn to meadow and eventually to woodland. It is now a Local Nature Reserve and Site of Metropolitan Importance for wildlife, populated with songbirds, woodpeckers and tawny owls. A lack of care and cash surrendered the graves to the ravages of nature and vandalism, but in the early 1980s the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery were formed to renovate and protect the cemetery. The cemetery was reopened in May 2001 after an extensive restoration project funded by Southwark Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Fifty memorials were restored along with the Anglican Chapel.

Views across London include St Paul's Cathedral. The Victorian part of the cemetery is currently in a poor state of repair, being best described as an elegant wilderness; locals like to call it a nature reserve. Many areas of the cemetery are fairly overgrown with vines, as visible in newer tourist photos. Numerous tombstones lean to the side. Although the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery are doing their best to restore some parts of the cemetery it is badly in need of care and funding. It is about and is a popular place to walk. The lodges and monumental entrance were designed by James Bunstone Bunning. There is an obelisk, the \\"Scottish Political Martyrs Memorial\\", the second monument (the other is in Edinburgh) dedicated to the leaders of the Friends of the People Society, popularly called the Scottish Martyrs, including Thomas Muir, Maurice Margarot, and Thomas Fyshe Palmer, who were transported to Australia in 1794. It was erected by Radical MP Joseph Hume in 1837. It is immediately on the right on Dissenters Road, when entering through the North Gate. A memorial commemorates nine Sea Scouts who died in the Leysdown Tragedy off the Isle of Sheppey in 1912, including Percy Baden Powell Huxford aged 12 (named after, but not related to, Lord Baden Powell). The original memorial, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was erected in 1914. Most of this was removed after vandalism, and only the base remains.Kent History Forum website. A picture of the original memorial can be seen on the . The present replacement memorial was erected in 1992, on the initiative of the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery. CWGC Australian plot There are a large number of First and Second World War war graves in the cemetery, the greater proportion (592 graves) being Commonwealth service burials from the former war. Most of those are concentrated between three war graves plots: the United Kingdom plot (Square 89), holding 266 graves, the Australian plot which holds 23 graves, and the Canadian plot (Square 52) which holds 36 graves, including burials of South African and New Zealand servicemen. Those buried in the UK plot and in individual graves outside the three plots are, because of not being marked by headstones, listed by name on a Screen Wall memorial inside the cemetery's main entrance. A second Screen Wall lists 110 Commonwealth service personnel of the Second World War who are buried in another war graves plot (Square 5), and elsewhere whose graves could not be marked by headstones. There is also a Belgian war grave of the First World War. CWGC Cemetery Report. A conducted tour of the cemetery is run by the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery, open to all, on the last Sunday of each month, starting from the Linden Grove gates at 2:15 p.m. At the centre of the cemetery are the remains of the Anglican Chapel, its roof gone but its stone walls intact. In media The cemetery is the setting for the Victorian poet Charlotte Mew's exploration of death, insanity and social alienation In Nunhead Cemetery and is the setting for Maurice Riordan's final poem, The January Birds in The Holy Land, his 2007 collection. The Woman Between the Worlds, a 1994 science fiction novel by F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre set in Victorian England, depicts the burial at Nunhead Cemetery in 1898 (in a closed coffin) of a female extraterrestrial. The novel avoids citing a precise location for this grave, in case some reader believes that alien remains can be retrieved from the site. The cemetery also featured in Episode 2 of the 2008 BBC series Spooks, although it was credited as Highgate Cemetery. The cemetery features in a number of scenes in the 1971 movie Melody. The cemetery was the location of a shoot in a 1995 episode of London's Burning.  Gallery  Nunhead Cemetery is one of the Magnificent Seven.

He was active in the American Abolitionism movement during the 1840s and 1850s, identifying himself with disunion and militant abolitionism. He was a member of the Secret Six who supported John Brown. During the Civil War, he served as colonel of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, the first federally authorized black regiment, from 1862‚Äì1864. See ‚ÄòFirebrand of Liberty, the Two Black Regiments that Changed the Course of the Civil War‚Äô by Stephen Ash. Following the war, Higginson devoted much of the rest of his life to fighting for the rights of freed people, women and other disfranchised peoples. Early life and education Higginson was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 22, 1823. He was a descendant of Francis Higginson, a Puritan minister and immigrant to the colony of Massachusetts Bay. His father, Stephen Higginson (born in Salem, Massachusetts, November 20, 1770; died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, February 20, 1834), was a merchant and philanthropist in Boston and steward of Harvard University from 1818 until 1834. His grandfather, also named Stephen Higginson, was a member of the Continental Congress. He was a distant cousin of Henry Lee Higginson, founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, a great grandson of his grandfather. A third great grandfather was New Hampshire Lieutenant-Governor John Wentworth.Mary Thacher Higginson, Thomas Wentworth Higginson - The Story of His Life (Boston & New York, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1914) pp.2-3 =Education and abolitionism= Higginson entered Harvard College at age thirteen and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa at sixteen.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 119. He graduated in 1841 and was a schoolmaster for two years. In 1842 he became engaged to Mary Elizabeth Channing. He then studied theology at the Harvard Divinity School. At the end of his first year of divinity training, he withdrew from the school to turn his attention to the abolitionist cause. He spent the subsequent year studying and, following the lead of Transcendentalist Unitarian minister Theodore Parker, fighting against the expected war with Mexico. Believing that war was only an excuse to expand slavery and the slave power, Higginson wrote anti-war poems and went door-to- door to get signatures for anti-war petitions. With the split of the anti- slavery movement in the 1840s, Higginson subscribed to the Disunion Abolitionists, who believed that as long as slave states remained a part of the union, Constitutional support for slavery could never be amended. =Marriage and family= Higginson married Mary Channing in 1847 after graduating from divinity school. Mary was the daughter of Dr. Walter Channing, a pioneer in the field of obstetrics and gynecology who taught at Harvard University, the niece of Unitarian minister, William Ellery Channing, and the sister of Henry David Thoreau's friend Ellery Channing. Higginson and Mary Channing had no children but raised Margaret Fuller Channing, the eldest daughter of Ellen Fuller and Ellery Channing. Ellen was the sister of the Transcendentalist and feminist author, Margaret Fuller.Frederick T. McGill, Jr., Channing of Concord: A Life of William Ellery Channing II, Rutgers University Press, 1967. Mary Channing died in 1877. Two years later Higginson married Mary Potter Thacher, with whom he had two daughters, one of whom survived into adulthood.the family tree of Thomas Wentworth Higginson Higginson was also related to Harriet Higginson, whose Wooddale, Illinois, home was the first commission of famed architect Bertrand Goldberg in 1934. Career =Ministry= A year after his leaving divinity school, a growing passion for abolitionism led Higginson to recommence his divinity studies. He graduated in 1847 and was called as pastor at the First Religious Society of Newburyport, Massachusetts, a Unitarian church known for its liberal Christianity.Broaddus, Dorothy C. Genteel Rhetoric: Writing High Culture in Nineteenth-Century Boston. Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina, 1999: 70. .Owen, Barbara. \\"History of the First Religious Society\\" , First Religious Society (Unitarian Universalist), Newburyport, MA. Accessed on 2010-08-14. He supported the Essex County Antislavery Society and criticized the poor treatment of workers at Newburyport cotton factories. Additionally, the young minister invited Theodore Parker and fugitive slave William Wells Brown to speak at the church, and in sermons he condemned northern apathy towards slavery. In his role as board member of the Newburyport Lyceum and against the wishes of the majority of the board, Higginson brought Ralph Waldo Emerson to speak.Beck, Janet Kemper. Creating the John Brown Legend: Emerson, Thoreau, Douglass, Child and Higginson in Defense of the Raid on Harpers Ferry. McFarland, 7 Apr 2009 p85-87 Higginson proved too radical for the congregation and was forced to resign in 1848. =Politics and militant abolitionism= Thomas Wentworth Higginson, circa Civil War years The Compromise of 1850 brought new challenges and new ambitions for the unemployed minister. He ran as the Free Soil party candidate in the Massachusetts Third Congressional District in 1850, but lost. Higginson called upon citizens to uphold God's law and disobey the Fugitive Slave Act. He joined the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization whose purpose was to protect fugitive slaves from pursuit and capture.Broaddus, Dorothy C. Genteel Rhetoric: Writing High Culture in Nineteenth-Century Boston. Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina, 1999: 70‚Äì71. . His joining of the group was inspired by the arrest and trial of the free black Frederick Jenkins, known as Shadrach. Abolitionists helped him escape to Canada. He participated with Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker in the attempt at freeing Thomas Sims, a Georgia slave who had escaped to Boston. In 1854, when the escaped Anthony Burns was threatened with extradition under the Fugitive Slave Act, Higginson led a small group who stormed the federal courthouse in Boston with battering rams, axes, cleavers, and revolvers. They could not prevent Burns from being taken back to the South. Higginson received a saber slash on his chin; he wore the scar proudly for the rest of his life. In 1852, Higginson became pastor of the Free Church in Worcester. During his tenure, Higginson not only supported abolition, but also temperance, labor rights, and rights of women. Returning from a voyage to Europe for the health of his wife, who had an unknown illness, Higginson organized a group of men on behalf of the New England Emigration Aid Company to use peaceful means as tensions rose after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. The act divided the region into the Kansas and Nebraska territories, whose residents would separately vote on whether to allow slavery within each jurisdiction's borders. Both abolitionist and pro-slavery supporters began to migrate to the territories. After his return, Higginson worked to keep activism aroused in New England by speechmaking, fundraising, and helping to organize the Massachusetts Kansas Aid Committee. He returned to the Kansas territory as an agent of the National Kansas Aid Committee, working to rebuild morale and distribute supplies to settlers. Higginson became convinced that abolition could not be attained by peaceful methods.Higginson, Thomas Wentworth \\"A Ride through Kanzas\\". Letters to the New York Times, 1856 (via archive.org)Sanborn, F.B. \\"Thomas Wentworth Higginson (Tributes)\\" The Massachusetts Magazine, Vol IV (1911), No 3, pg 142 (via archive.org) As sectional conflict escalated, he continued to support disunion abolitionism, organizing the Worcester Disunion Convention in 1857. The convention asserted abolition as its primary goal, even if it would lead the country to war. Higginson was a fervent supporter of John Brown and is remembered as one of the \\"Secret Six\\" abolitionists who helped Brown raise money and procure supplies for his intended slave insurrection at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. When Brown was captured, Higginson tried to raise money for a trial defense and made plans to help the leader escape from prison, though he was ultimately unsuccessful. Other members of the Secret Six fled to Canada or elsewhere after Brown's capture, but Higginson never fled, despite his involvement being common knowledge. Higginson was never arrested or called to testify. =Woman's rights activism= Higginson was one of leading male advocates of woman's rights during the decade before the Civil War. In 1853, he addressed the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention in support of a petition asking that women be allowed to vote on ratification of the new constitution. Published as \\"Woman and Her Wishes,\\"Million, Joelle, Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement. Praeger, 2003. , pp. 136‚Äì37, 173. the address was used many years as a woman's rights tract, as was an 1859 article he wrote for the Atlantic Monthly, \\"Ought Women to Learn the Alphabet?\\"Meyer, 2000, pp. 266‚Äì82. A close friend and supporter of woman's rights leader Lucy Stone, he performed the marriage ceremony of Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell in 1855 and, by sending their protest of unjust marriage laws to the press, was responsible for their \\"Marriage Protest\\" becoming a famous document.Million, 2003, p. 195. Together with Stone, he compiled and published The Woman's Rights Almanac for 1858,The Woman's Rights Almanac for 1858, Containing Facts, Statistics, Arguments, Records of Progress, and Proofs of the Need of It. Worcester, Mass: Z. Baker & Co.; Boston: R. F. Walcutt. [1857] which provided data such as income disparity between the sexes as well as a summary of gains made by the national movement during its first seven years. He also compiled and published, in 1858, \\"Consistent Democracy: The Elective Franchise for Women. Twenty-five Testimonies of Prominent Men,\\" brief excerpts favoring woman suffrage from the speeches or writing of such men as Wendell Phillips, Henry Ward Beecher, Rev. Wm.H. Channing, Horace Greeley, Gerrit Smith, and various governors, legislators, and legislative reports.\\"The Elective Franchise for Woman,\\" National Anti-Slavery Standard, March 27, 1858, p. 3. A member of the National Woman's Rights Central Committee since 1853 or 1854, he was one of nine activists retained in that post when that large body of state representatives was reduced in 1858.New York Times, May 15, 1858, p. 4. After the Civil War, Higginson was an organizer of the New England Woman Suffrage Association in 1868,Dubois, Ellen Carol, Feminism and Suffrage: The Emergence of an Independent Women's Movement in America, 1848‚Äì1869, Cornell University Press, (1978), p. 168. and of the American Woman Suffrage Association the following year. He was one of the original editors of the suffrage newspaper The Woman's Journal, founded in 1870, and contributed a front-page column to it for fourteen years. As a two-year member of the Massachusetts legislature, 1880‚Äì82, he was a valuable link between suffragists and the legislature.Merk, Lois Bannister, \\"Massachusetts and the Woman Suffrage Movement,\\" Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1958, Revised, 1961, pp. 16‚Äì17. =Civil War years= During the early part of the Civil War, Higginson was a captain in the 51st Massachusetts Infantry from November 1862 to October 1864, when he was retired because of a wound received in the preceding August. He was colonel of the First South Carolina Volunteers, the first authorized regiment recruited from freedmen for Union military service. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton required that black regiments be commanded by white officers. \\"We, their officers, did not go there to teach lessons, but to receive them,\\" Higginson wrote. \\"There were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred in all their lives.\\"\\"The Color of Bravery: United States Colored Troops in the Civil War.\\" Battlefields.org. Retrieved September 29, 2019. Higginson described his Civil War experiences in Army Life in a Black Regiment (1870), which has been published online by Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org). He contributed to the preservation of Negro spirituals by copying dialect verses and music he heard sung around the regiment's campfires. In his book, Drawn by the Sword, historian James M. McPherson argued that Higginson's service as a Union soldier showed in part that he did not share the \\"powerful racial prejudices\\" of others during the time period. =Religious activism= After the Civil War, Higginson became active in the Free Religious Association (FRA) and delivered the speech The Sympathy of Religions in 1870, which was later published and circulated. The address argued that all religions shared essential truths and a common exhortation toward benevolence, and that, indeed, division among them was ultimately artificial: \\"Every step in the progress of each brings it nearer to all the rest. For us, the door out of superstition and sin may be called Christianity; that is an historical name only, the accident of a birthplace. But other nations find other outlets; they must pass through their own doors.\\"Higginson, Thomas Wentworth (1870-06-02). The Sympathy of Religions. First printed in The Radical, Boston, 1871. Retrieved from Gutenberg.org, 2018-05-05. He pushed the FRA to tolerate even those who did not accept the liberal principles the Association espoused, asking \\"Are we as large as our theory? ... Are we as ready to tolerate ... the Evangelical man as the Mohammedan?\\" Although his own relationship to evangelical Protestants remained strained, he saw the exclusion of any religious mindset as fundamentally dangerous to the organization.Schmidt, Leigh Eric (2005). Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality from Emerson to Oprah. New York: HarperCollins, pp. 134-135. Higginson spoke at the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893 and praised the great strides that had been made in the mutual understanding of the world's great religions, describing the Parliament as the culmination of the FRA's greatest ambitions. =Later years and death= Grave of Thomas Wentworth Higginson After the Civil War, he devoted most of his time to literature. His writings show a deep love of nature, art and humanity. In his Common Sense About Women (1881) and his Women and Men (1888), he advocated equality of opportunity and equality of rights for the two sexes. In 1874, Higginson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In 1891, Higginson became one of the founders of the Society of American Friends of Russian Freedom (SAFRF). He edited its public appeal \\"To the Friends of Russian Freedom\\". Later, in 1907 Higginson was the vice-president of the SAFRF. In 1905, he joined with Jack London and Upton Sinclair to form the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. Higginson was an Advisory Editor for the second attempt at The Massachusetts Magazine. Higginson died May 9, 1911. Although his death record states that he was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he is actually buried in Cambridge Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the intersection of Riverview, Lawn, and Prospect paths.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 117. \\"Massachusetts, Deaths, 1841-1915,\\" Vol.1911/26 Death: Pg.402. State Archives, Boston. Beliefs Higginson's deep conviction in the evils of slavery stemmed in part from his mother's influence. He greatly admired abolitionists, who, despite persecution, showed courage and commitment to the worthy cause. The writings of William Lloyd Garrison and Lydia Maria Child were particularly influential to Higginson's abolitionist enthusiasm during the early 1840s. =Homeopathy= Higginson was a strong advocate of homeopathy. In 1863, he wrote to Mary Channing Higginson ‚Äì \\".. and also Ms. Laura Towne, the homeopathic physician of the department, chief teacher and probably the most energetic person this side of civilisation: a person of splendid health and astonishing capacity.... I think she has done more for me than anyone else by prescribing homeopathic arsenic as a tonic, one powder every day on rising, and it has already, I think (3 doses) affected me.\\" =Political parties and ideology= In politics, Higginson was successively a Republican, an Independent and a Democrat. He described his early youth as having an interest in Brook Farm and of Fourierism. Relationship with Emily Dickinson Letter and envelope from Emily Dickinson to Thomas Wentworth Higginson Higginson is remembered as a correspondent and literary mentor to the poet Emily Dickinson. In April 1862, Higginson published an article in the Atlantic Monthly, titled \\"Letter to a Young Contributor,\\" in which he advised budding young writers to step up. Emily Dickinson, a 32-year-old woman from Amherst, Massachusetts, sent a letter to Higginson, enclosing four poems and asking, \\"Are you too deeply occupied to say if my Verse is alive?\\" (Letter 260) He was not ‚Äì his reply included gentle \\"surgery\\" (that is, criticism) of Dickinson's raw, odd verse, questions about Dickinson's personal and literary background, and a request for more poems. Higginson's next reply contained high praise, causing Dickinson to reply that it \\"gave no drunkenness\\" only because she had \\"tasted rum before\\"; she still, though, had \\"few pleasures so deep as your opinion, and if I tried to thank you, my tears would block my tongue\\" (Letter 265). But in the same letter, Higginson warned her against publishing her poetry because of its unconventional form and style. Gradually, Higginson became Dickinson's mentor and \\"preceptor,\\" though he almost felt out of Dickinson's league. \\"The bee himself did not evade the schoolboy more than she evaded me,\\" he wrote, \\"and even at this day I still stand somewhat bewildered, like the boy.\\" (\\"Emily Dickinson's Letters,\\" Atlantic Monthly, October 1891) After Dickinson died, Higginson collaborated with Mabel Loomis Todd in publishing volumes of her poetry ‚Äì heavily edited in favor of conventional punctuation, diction, and rhyme. In White Heat (Knopf, 2008), an account of Higginson's friendship with Dickinson, author Brenda Wineapple credits Higginson with more editorial sensitivity than literary historians have assumed. Higginson's intellectual prominence helped gain favor for Dickinson's altered but still startling and strange poetry.

Patterson was a veteran of World War II and a journalist writing for Maclean's magazine in the early 1950s.Tom Patterson. They never rationed courage: Letters home from the war, 1940-1945. Mercury Press. 1995. From the time that he was a teenager, he had thought that his home town of Stratford, Ontario should be home to performances of Shakespeare's plays. The town was suffering from industrial decline due to the declining fortunes of the rail industry. Patterson, with no experience of the theatre, proposed the idea of a theatre festival. In 1952, he invited the prominent British director Tyrone Guthrie to visit Stratford and help bring their idea of a Shakespearean theatre to fruition. When Guthrie accepted the offer to visit, national newspapers started to take notice. Patterson told The Globe and Mail he wanted to provide \\"Canadian acting talent the opportunity to work with top directors and actors without having to leave the country\\". For his part, Guthrie was interested in a venture that \\"offers a fresh advance in the production of Shakespeare\\". With Guthrie supporting the Festival idea, Patterson persuaded the town council to back it, and had an enthusiastic committee of local citizens to help organize it. Guthrie advised him to hire a big name for the first production, so Patterson received a small loan from the city council so he could visit Alec Guinness and invite him to perform in the opening season. The festival has grown and expanded significantly since that time.J. Alan B. Somerset. 1991. The Stratford Festival Story, 1st edition. Greenwood Press. Tom Patterson. 1987. First Stage. McClelland and Stewart. Patterson served as the festival's general manager during the first season and worked in other capacities until 1967. He also founded the touring company Canadian Players with actor Douglas Campbell and took part in the establishment of a number of cultural institutions, including the Canadian Theatre Centre and the National Theatre School. Patterson was also the founder of the Dawson City Gold Rush Festival. Patterson was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1967 and was also awarded the Order of Ontario. He also received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario. One of the festival theatres was named after him in 1991, as is one of the islands in the Avon River.Martin Hunter. Romancing the Bard: Stratford at Fifty. Dundurn Press. 2001.

It is found in parasitic protozoa such as leishmania and trypanosomes. These protozoal parasites are the cause of leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness and Chagas' disease. Trypanothione was discovered by Alan Fairlamb. Its structure was proven by chemical synthesis. It is unique to the Kinetoplastida and not found in other parasitic protozoa such as Entamoeba histolytica. Since this thiol is absent from humans and is essential for the survival of the parasites, the enzymes that make and use this molecule are targets for the development of new drugs to treat these diseases. Trypanothione-dependent enzymes include reductases, peroxidases, glyoxalases and transferases. Trypanothione-disulfide reductase (TryR) was the first trypanothione-dependent enzyme to be discovered (EC 1.8.1.12). It is an NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme that reduces trypanothione disulfide. TryR is essential for survival of these parasites both in vitro and in the human host. A major function of trypanothione is in the defence against oxidative stress. Here, trypanothione-dependent enzymes such as tryparedoxin peroxidase (TryP) reduce peroxides using electrons donated either directly from trypanothione, or via the redox intermediate tryparedoxin (TryX). Trypanothione-dependent hydrogen peroxide metabolism is particularly important in these organisms because they lack catalase. Since the trypanosomatids also lack an equivalent of thioredoxin reductase, trypanothione reductase is the sole path that electrons can take from NADPH to these antioxidant enzymes. 500px  References  Category:Thiols Category:Peptides ","title":"Trypanothione"},{"id":"1165467","text":"OSN Saturn (–û–°–ù –°–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω –£–§–°–ò–ù –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –ø–æ –≥. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ; Otdel Spetsialnogo Naznacheniya Saturn) is the Moscow department of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) special purpose unit.

The company handcrafts each of its teddy bears and produces almost 500,000 teddy bears each year. The company was formerly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol BEAR, but was taken private by The Mustang Group, a Boston-based private equity firm, on September 30, 2005, partially to avoid the reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. History The company was founded in 1983 by John Sortino, who sold handcrafted teddy bears in an open-air market in Burlington, Vermont. Sortino happened upon the idea of packaging and selling bears through the mail when a tourist visiting Burlington wanted a bear mailed to her home. The concept was called the \\"Bear- Gram\\", which features the customized teddy bear placed in a box (complete with an \\"air hole\\") and stuffed with other goodies. By 1995, the company moved into its new headquarters in Vermont's Champlain Valley. The company has two factories: one in Shelburne and one in Newport. The Shelburne factory is an especially popular tourist destination, and also served as a concert site for the annual Vermont Mozart Festival. The company also maintained two retail locations in Vermont - Shelburne and on the main road between Waterbury and Stowe. Also by 1995, VTB had sponsored on the East Coast various guns-for- bears exchanges and expanded to the West Coast in 1996 starting with UC Irvine's Student Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Brea Police Department. In May 1997, the Vermont Teddy Bear Co. filed a copyright infringement suit against Disney over \\"Pooh-Grams\\" being similar to its mail- order \\"Bear-Gram\\" trademark and logo. VTB acquired Calyx & Corolla, an upscale flower company headquartered in Vero Beach, Florida in 2003. One of Vermont Teddy Bear's marketing slogans claimed that sending a teddy bear is \\"a creative alternative to sending flowers.\\" In 2005, the company launched a new sister company, Gift Bag Boutique, which offered handbags and purses along with many make-up accessories. Along with PajamaGram, which sold gift pajamas, and TastyGram, which offered gourmet food gifts, the creation of this sister company brought the total number of companies under the Vermont Teddy Bear umbrella to five. Gift Bag Boutique and TastyGram stopped accepting orders as of June 26, 2008. and For Valentine's Day of 2005, Vermont Teddy Bear caused widespread controversy by offering a \\"Crazy for You\\" Bear which wore a white strait jacket with a red heart embroidered and a tag entitled \\"Commitment Papers\\" came with the bear. Mental health groups from all over the U.S. asked for the bear to be pulled out of production, VTB kept the bear up for sale but sold out quickly and Elizabeth Robert, the company head, resigned from the board of Vermont's largest hospital, Fletcher Allen Health Care. In May, VTB agreed to be acquired by a Mustang Group led investment group for $6.50 a share. Advertising VTB was listed among \\"'a broad range of direct marketers' pitched by the show's hosts themselves\\" who were taking out more ads on talk radio in 2010, according to Dan Metter, director of talk-radio sales of Premiere Radio Networks.Wilkerson, David B.,\\"Talk radio‚Äôs a hit in polarized environment: Ad sales are rising for Clear Channel's Premiere Radio Networks,\\" Marketwatch, Sept. 22, 2010, 6:00 am.

GETS uses enhancements based on existing commercial technology.  Purpose  GETS supports federal, state, local, and tribal government, industry, and non-governmental organization personnel during crisis or emergencies by providing emergency access and priority processing for local and long-distance telephone calls on the public switched telephone network. GETS is intended to be used in an emergency or crisis situation when the public switched telephone network is congested and the probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means is reduced. GETS is necessary because reliance on telecommunications has been accompanied by an increased vulnerability to network congestion and system failures. Although backup systems are in place, disruptions in service can still occur. Natural disasters, power outages, fiber cable cuts, and software problems can cripple the telephone services of entire regions. Additionally, congestion in the public switched telephone network, such as the well- documented \\"Mother's Day phenomenon\\", in which Mother's Day generally has the highest blocking of long-distance telephone calls of any single day of the year, can prevent access to circuits. However, during times of emergency, crisis, or war, government personnel and emergency workers need to know that their calls will go through. For cellular telephone users, a related capability is offered by the Nationwide Wireless Priority Service (WPS). WPS users have the ability to queue at the top for the next available communications channel to their registered base station in order to place their call by dialing , greatly enhancing their ability to complete wireless calls during times of congestion. WPS is available only to designated leadership at all government levels, national security, emergency responders, and private sector critical infrastructure personnel, as approved by the NCS and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Rules and Requirements. GETS uses these major types of networks: * The local networks provided by local exchange carriers and wireless providers, such as cellular carriers and personal communications services (PCS) * The major long-distance networks provided by interexchange carriers such as AT&T;, Verizon, and Sprint, including their international services * Government-leased networks, including the Federal Technology Service and the Defense Switched Network In accordance with Section 1(g)5 of Executive Order 12472, the NCS also performs research and development to further enhance the GETS and WPS services through the use of new packet- based technologies (such as IP, or Internet Protocol). This work is done in the NCS' lab, formerly referred to as the eXperimental Testbed Environment. The multi-vendor lab is in the process of preparation for interoperability tests with other labs and research groups to validate these new approaches in today's Next Generation Networks (NGNs). Interoperability between NGNs and legacy telephone systems will continue to be an area of high interest and more elaborate studies for the NCS and their Committee of Principals throughout the transition from these legacy systems.  Accessibility  GETS is accessed through a dialing plan and Personal Identification Number (PIN) card verification system. Using common telephone equipment, the user dials the universal access number 710-627-4387 (710-NCS-GETS). A prompt directs the entry of the user's assigned twelve-digit PIN and the destination telephone number. Once the user is authenticated as valid, the call receives special treatment. When dealing with GETS User Assistance, users may need to provide a registered password of 4 to 9 alphanumeric characters for those cards issued to an individual rather than through stockpile. Effectiveness GETS is designed to provide a 90% call completion rate when call volume is eight times normal capacity.

They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. The word is from leio- + myo- + -oma, \\"smooth-muscle tumor\\". The plural form can be either the English leiomyomas or the classical leiomyomata. Uterus Leiomyoma enucleated from a uterus. External surface on left; cut surface on right Micrograph of a small, well-circumscribed colonic leiomyoma arising from the muscularis mucosae and showing fascicles of spindle cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated, cigar-shaped nuclei. Uterine fibroids are leiomyomata of the uterine smooth muscle. As other leiomyomata, they are benign, but may lead to excessive menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), often cause anemia and may lead to infertility. A rare form of these tumors is uterine lipoleiomyoma‚Äîbenign tumors consisting of a mixture of adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. Uterine lipoleiomyomata have been observed together with ovarian and other pathologies and some of them may develop into liposarcoma. These tumors are monoclonal, and non-random chromosomal abnormalities have been seen in 40% of the tumors. Gallbladder Mesenchymal neoplasms of the gallbladder are rare and in particular leiomyomas of the gallbladder have been rarely reported, all of them in patients with immune system disorders. Although, recently, a case was reported in absence of associated immunodeficiency at Monash Hospital in Melbourne Australia in a healthy 39-year-old woman with no symptoms. Skin Leiomyomas of the skin are generally (1) acquired, and (2) divided into several categories: *Solitary cutaneous leiomyoma *Multiple cutaneous (or pilar) leiomyomas arising from the arrectores pilorum muscles *Angioleiomyomas (Vascular leiomyomas) that are thought to arise from vascular smooth muscle *Dartoic (or genital) leiomyomas originating in the dartos muscles of the genitalia, areola, and nipple *Angiolipoleiomyoma Esophagus, stomach and small intestines Leiomyoma is the most common benign mesenchymal tumor of esophagus and second most common benign tumor of the small bowel (with gastrointestinal stromal tumor as most common).Radiologic Pathology Archives: Esophageal Neoplasms: Radiologic- Pathologic Correlation Rachel B.

In the Episcopal liturgical calendar he is remembered on January23. Background =Early life and education= Born in Boston, Brooks was descended through his father, William Gray Brooks, from the Rev. John Cotton; through his mother, Mary Ann Phillips, he was a great-grandson of Samuel Phillips, Jr., founder of Phillips Academy (Andover, Massachusetts). Three of Brooks' five brothersFrederic, Arthur and John Cottonwere eventually ordained in the Episcopal Church. Phillips Brooks prepared for college at the Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard University in 1855 at the age of 20, where he was elected to the A.D. Club. He worked briefly as a school teacher at Boston Latin, but, upon being fired, felt that he had failed miserably. He wrote, \\"I do not know what will become of me and I do not care much.‚Ä¶ I wish I were fifteen years old again. I believe I might become a stunning man: but somehow or other I do not seem in the way to come to much now.\\"Clyde E. Fant and William M. Pinson, Jr., Twenty Centuries of Great Preaching, Volume 6 (Waco, TX: Word, 1971), p. 114 In 1856 he began to study for ordination in the Episcopal Church in the Virginia Theological Seminary at Alexandria, Virginia. While a seminarian there, he preached at Sharon Chapel (now All Saints Episcopal Church, Sharon Chapel) in nearby Fairfax County. =Pastoral career= Statue by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Trinity Church, Boston, dedicated 1910 Memorial to Phillips Brooks in Trinity Church, Boston In 1859 he graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary, was ordained deacon by Bishop William Meade of Virginia, and became rector of the Church of the Advent, Philadelphia. In 1860 he was ordained priest, and in 1862 became rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity, Philadelphia, where he remained seven years, gaining an increasing name as Broad churchman,\\"Brooks, Phillips\\", in Concise Dictionary of American Biography (1964), New York: Scribner's. preacher, and patriot. In addition to his moral stature, he was a man of great physical bearing as well, standing six feet four inches tall. During the American Civil War he upheld the cause of the North and opposed slavery, and his sermon on the death of Abraham Lincoln was an eloquent expression of the character of both men. His sermon at Harvard's commemoration of the Civil War dead in 1865 likewise attracted attention nationwide. In 1869 he became rector of Trinity Church, Boston; today, his statue is located on the left exterior of the church. Brooks wrote that his only ambition was \\"to be a parish priest and, though not much of one, [I] would as a college president be still less\\". Under his inspiration, architect Henry Hobson Richardson, muralist John LaFarge, and stained glass artists William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones created an architectural masterpiece in Trinity Church, Boston, among the notable features of which was the first freestanding liturgical altar in the United States in an overall chancel design that attracted attention for its Liturgical Movement influence even in British architectural magazines. Behind the free standing altar there was another revival from the early church chancel, a great synthranon for priests which surrounded the apse. Because Massachusetts had two bishops then the bishops chairs were placed within the altar rail to either side of the holy table. There were no choir stalls to distract from the central altar, which was hardly recognized as an altar in a period when most altars were backed up on to elaborate carved screens. Until 1888, there was also no pulpit. Brooks preferred to preach his legendary sermons from a modest lectern near the rector's stall on the south side of the chancel. There was also an eagle lectern on a balustraded ambo in the center at the chancel steps. Such was the magnificence of Trinity Church that, in his chapter on Phillips Brooks' chancel in Ralph Adams Cram: An Architect's Four Quests, Douglass Shand-Tucci calls it \\"an American Hagia Sophia\\", a reflection of Brooks' architectural and liturgical tastes, disclosed in his travel writings, where in Germany for instance he referred to \\"thrilling music\\" and \\"thrilling incense\\" in respect to a liturgy he attended there in the Roman Catholic cathedral. Holy Week in Rome also greatly moved him, especially the papal high mass on Easter. Although he despaired of Anglo-Catholic ritualism, he championed many aspects of the liturgical movement including congregational singing at the liturgy. At the Eucharist, for instance, he would preach, not from the pulpit, but from the chancel steps, and although he liked to preach in a black academic gown he never failed to appear in a commodious white surplice and priest's stole when he officiated at the office or Eucharist. In 1877 the building of Trinity was completed, but the Venetian mosaics Brooks and Richardson wanted they could not then afford. It was not until the magnificent new altar and sanctuary of Maginnis & Walsh in 1938 that Trinity's chancel reflected that aspect of their dreams for Trinity, which Brooks called \\"America's glory forever\\". Here Phillips Brooks preached Sunday after Sunday to great congregations, until he was consecrated Bishop of Massachusetts in 1891. In 1886, he had declined an election as assistant bishop of Pennsylvania. He was for many years an overseer and preacher of Harvard University. In 1881 he declined an invitation to be the sole preacher to the university and professor of Christian ethics. On April 30, 1891 he was elected sixth Bishop of Massachusetts, and on the 14 October was consecrated to that office in Trinity Church. He died unmarried in 1893, after an episcopate of only 15 months. His death was a major event in the history of Boston. One observer reported: \\"They buried him like a king. Harvard students carried his body on their shoulders. All barriers of denomination were down. Roman Catholics and Unitarians felt that a great man had fallen in Israel.\\"Mrs. Edward S. Drown, in The Witness, March 21, 1940 Influence and legacy =Publications= In 1877 Brooks published a course of lectures upon preaching, which he had delivered at the theological school of Yale University, and which are an expression of his own experience. In 1879 appeared the Bohlen Lectures on The Influence of Jesus. In 1878 he published his first volume of sermons, and from time to time issued other volumes, including Sermons Preached in English Churches (1883) and \\"The Candle of the Lord\\" and Other Sermons (1895). Brooks was also famous and beloved for his collections of sermons, The Purpose and Use of Comfort, first published in 1878, which includes the title sermon as well as: \\"The Withheld Completions of Life,\\" \\"The Conqueror from Edom,\\" \\"Keeping the Faith,\\" \\"The Soul's Refuge in God,\\" \\"The Man with One Talent,\\" \\"The Food of Man, \\"The Symbol and the Reality,\\" \\"Is It I?\\" and more. Today, he is probably best known for authoring the Christmas carol \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\". Brooks also introduced Helen Keller to Christianity and to Anne Sullivan. =Awards and historical monuments= Brooks's understanding of individuals and of other religious traditions gained a following across a broad segment of society, as well as increased support for the Episcopal Church. Within his lifetime, he received honorary degrees from Harvard (1877) and Columbia (1887), and the Doctor of Divinity degree by the University of Oxford, England (1885). In addition, Brooks's close ties with Harvard University led to the creation of Phillips Brooks House in Harvard Yard, built 7 years after his death. On January 23, 1900, it was dedicated to serve \\"the ideal of piety, charity, and hospitality.\\" The Phillips Brooks House originally housed a Social Service Committee, which became the Phillips Brooks House Association in 1904. It ceased formal religious affiliation in the 1920s, but to this day remains in operation as a student-run group of volunteer organizations. Brooks' theological alma mater, Virginia Theological Seminary, honors him with a statue outside its library. Rev. A.V.G. Allen, an Episcopal clergyman and professor of ecclesiastical history at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, published several biographical works on Brooks. These included the two-volume Phillips Brooks, Life and Letters (1901); and the abbreviated and revised one-volume Phillips Brooks (1907), both published in New York. In 1961, Raymond W. Albright published another biography of Brooks entitled Focus on Infinity. His contemporary biographer is Douglass Shand-Tucci, who published a chapter on the bishop in Ralph Adams Cram: an Architects Four Quests in 2005, and in 2009 on the website of Back Bay Historical/The Global Boston Perspective and elaborated as \\"The Saint Bishop and the American Hagia Sophia\\", an October 2009 lecture at the New England Historical Genealogical Society in Boston as part of \\"The Gods of Copley Square\\" series. Another contemporary biographer, examining the preacher's evangelical legacy, is Gillis J. Harp. Gillis Harp has now written a major study, \\"Brahmin Prophet : Phillips Brooks and the Path of Liberal Protestantism\\". A private elementary school in Menlo Park, CAPhillips Brooks Schoolis named for Phillips Brooks, as is Brooks School in his hometown of North Andover, Massachusetts, the latter founded by Endicott Peabody, who also founded the Groton School. The Brooks family founded a Brooks Memorial School in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1874 in memory of Phillips' brother, the Rev. Frederic Brooks, who died in an accident in Cambridge. That school was sponsored in part by John D. Rockefeller and operated under the Brooks name until 1891 and exists to this day under the name of the Hathaway Brown School. John S. White, first headmaster of the school in Cleveland, also founded a Phillips Brooks School in Philadelphia in 1904 that operated there until 1919. The Episcopal Church remembers Phillips Brooks annually on January 23, the anniversary of his death.Robert Atwell and Christopher L. Weber, \\"Celebrating the Saints\\" (Harrisburg, PA. Morehouse Publishing, 2001). He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Notes Raymond W. Albright, Focus on Infinity: A Life of Philips Brooks (New York, 1961).

Meade graduated with high honors and as valedictorian in 1808.Slaughter at p. 9 At the urging of his mother and his cousin Mrs. Custis, Meade studied theology privately under the Rev. Walter Addison near the newly established national capital, and lived for a time in Alexandria, Virginia across the Potomac River from Rev. Addison's parish. He was particularly impressed by Soame Jenyns Internal Evidence of Christianity and William Wilberforce's Practical View. Meade also returned to Princeton in 1809 to continue some graduate studies in divinity (since it had been organized by the Presbyterian Church), but caught a near-fatal fever, and so returned home to work on the farm as well as to build his own Shenandoah valley home at Mountain View (an estate which remains today, although no longer in Meade family ownership). Family Since this Meade later published genealogies of Virginia families, and in one pamphlet distinguished the Episcopal Church from the \\"Romish,\\" he acknowledged the first of his ancestors to arrive in America was Andrew Meade, a Roman Catholic who emigrated to New York and married Quaker Mary Latham of Flushing. The couple moved to what was then Nansemond County, Virginia, where great- grandfather Meade \\"abjured his allegiance to the Roman Church,\\" became a vestryman of the Suffolk Church, and briefly represented the county in the House of Burgesses (the forerunner to the Virginia General Assembly, in which his grandson David and great-grandson Andrew would also serve).Suffolk parish may have had two vestries.

One of their sons, Richard Kidder Meade (born 1746), married Jane Randolph, daughter of Richard Randolph of Curles, whom the family noted was a descendant of Pocahontas as well as grandfather of John Randolph of Roanoke. However, they had no children before Jane died. After the Revolutionary war, in 1780, Col. R.K. Meade married again, to Mary Randolph, the daughter of Benjamin Grymes and widow of William Randolph of Chatsworth, who bore him four daughters and four sons, including the future bishop.Slaughter, Philip, Memoir of the Life of the Rt. Rev. William Meade (Cambridge:John Wilson and Son, 1885) pp. 5‚Äì7 Young William Meade married Mary, daughter of his Frederick County neighbor and lay reader Philip Nelson, on January 31, 1810. She bore his three sons before dying on July 3, 1817, and was buried at Old Chapel, as later would their sons Philip Nelson Meade (1811‚Äì1873) and Francis Burwell Meade (1815‚Äì1886).Slaughter at pp. 12‚Äì13, 37 Three years after her death, on December 16, 1820, William Meade remarried, to Thomasia, daughter of Thomas Nelson of Yorktown and Hanover, who zealously assisted him in his ministry for two decades before dying on May 20, 1836. She was buried at Fork Church in Hanover County.Memoir of the Life of the Rt. Rev. William Meade Bishop Meade's middle son, Richard Kidder Meade (1812‚Äì1892) became a clergyman, as did five of his grandsons.Slaughter p. 42 Ministry The elderly bishop James Madison of Virginia ordained Meade as a deacon on February 24, 1811. Meade afterward recalled that the congregation consisted of fifteen gentlemen and three ladies, almost all of them his relatives, and that on the way to Bruton Church many more gun-toting students and hunting dogs had passed them. When Meade traveled back through Richmond, the newly ordained deacon noted that the city's only church St. John's was only open for communion occasions, and that the Episcopalian Dr. Buchanan and Presbyterian Dr. Blair alternated Sundays.Slaughter at pp. 13‚Äì14 Bishop Madison died about a year later, and at least two men declined offers to become his successor. After the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1786 was found legal by Virginia's highest court in 1803, the new Episcopal Church, which had over 180 priests at the start of the Revolutionary War, was desperately short of ministers. By 1811, with Bishop Madison very infirm, no one from Virginia attended the General Convention. The following year Meade and several other prominent Virginians convinced William Holland Wilmer of Chestertown, Maryland, to move to Alexandria and the new national capital to serve as rector at St. Paul's Church after the newly ordained deacon Meade tried to serve those parishioners' needs as well as those of Alexandria's older parish for several months despite their significant distance down the Lord Fairfax Highway from his family's preferred home. Only seven Virginia priests (including Meade and Wilmer) gathered for the second diocesan convocation to select Madison's successor, many fewer than the priests and laity (led by Carter Braxton) who had gathered in 1805 and declined their Bishop Madison's request to appoint an assistant for him (with rights of succession). Finally, Meade, Wilmer and several other prominent Episcopalians convinced Richard Channing Moore to move to Richmond, Virginia to become rector of Monumental Church (a significant parish then being built as a memorial to those who died in a disastrous theater fire), and Moore in due course became bishop Madison's successor. Bishop Thomas John Claggett ordained Meade as a priest in 1814. From his ordination until 1821, deacon and then Rev. Meade served as the assistant to Rev. Alexander Balmain, rector of Frederick Parish and who usually served in Winchester, Virginia, about 15 miles away from Meade's home. Meade normally officiated every other Sunday at the Old Chapel near his family's plantations. On the alternate Sundays, his father in law served as the parish's lay leader, while Rev. Meade visited other congregations nearby or more remotely.Nelson pp. 51‚Äì52 After Rev. Balmaine died, Meade took on assistants who served at Winchester and Wickliffe, until those parishes were separated from Frederick Parish. Meade also remained as rector after his consecration as assistant bishop as discussed below, in part because his predecessors all kept other positions. Meade also continued manual labor on his farm, and had specifically sought assurances from Bishop Madison before ordination that such work would not violate a longstanding church canon against servile labor, for Meade firmly believed sloth had helped all but destroy the Church of Virginia.J.E. Booty, William Meade: Evangelical Churchman (alumni pamphlet in V.T.S. collection, dated 1962) at p. 1Johns at pp. 45‚Äì46 writes that Meade considered manual labor part of his daily devotion. He also home-taught his sons and nephew, both in scholarly work and manual labor. Later, Meade became known for his forays throughout Virginia, especially by horse even during severe weather, preaching among diverse parishes, until he ceded to old age and used a carriage (which some joked dated from his father's service with General Washington).R. Nelson, Reminiscences of the Right Rev. William Meade, D.D.: Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia from August 19, 1829 to March 14th 1862 (Shanghai, Ching-Foong General Printing Office 1878) pp. 24‚Äì25 In 1818, Meade and Wilmer helped organize an education society in Alexandria. Five years later, after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a seminary in Williamsburg, both helped form the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria to train young men for the ministry in Maryland, Virginia and southern states. Meade also supported the American Tract Society, and the Bible Society, except as the former grew to support abolitionism, as discussed below. Later, from 1842‚Äì1862, bishop Meade served as the seminary's president, as well as delivered an annual course of lectures on pastoral theology. Meade also helped found the Evangelical Knowledge Society (1847) and served as its president. That organization opposed what it considered the heterodoxy of many of the books published by the Sunday School Union, and attempted to displace them by issuing works of a more evangelical type. Episcopate In 1829, after Wilmer's unexpected death and as Bishop Moore approached retirement, Meade became assistant Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia. Three years earlier, he had refused suggestions that he apply to become the now-elderly Bishop William White's assistant in the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. Nonetheless, Bishop White led several other bishops who gathered at St. James' Church in Philadelphia during Meade's consecration as Bishop Moore's assistant. The new suffragan's first official act, on October 30, 1829, was consecrating a new building for Christ Church in Winchester. Meade then began an extensive visitation of the diocese, which took him to Martinsburg, then through the Shenandoah valley (Woodstock, Harrisonburg, and Staunton) before conducting Christmas services in Halifax and returning north to Alexandria. In 1832, Meade traveled across the Appalachian mountains for visitations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He also served as rector of Christ Church, Norfolk in 1834‚Äì1836, which may have prompted Meade to resign as rector of his home Cunningham Chapel parish (Rev. Stringfellow succeeded him for five years, followed by several longer-serving rectors). Rt. Rev. Meade thus became the first Virginia bishop to hold his position full-time, without concurrent responsibilities for an individual parish (as had bishop Moore with Monumental Church) or institution (as had bishop Madison with the College of William and Mary). In 1841, Meade traveled to London and met the future archbishop of Canterbury J.B. Sumner, among others. When Bishop Moore died later that year, Meade succeeded him as Bishop of Virginia, and soon consecrated Maryland native John Johns as his assistant (and successor more than two decades later).Yuill biography at p. 8, at http://archive.churchsociety.org/churchman/documents/Cman_077_3_Yuill.pdf Whereas the diocese had 44 clergy serving 40 parishes and 1,1462 communicants when Meade was consecrated as suffragan, the numbers had risen to 87 clergy serving 99 parishes and 3,702 communicants by the year Bishop Moore died, and 116 clergy serving 123 parishes and 7,876 communicants by 1860.T. Felder Dorn, Challenges on the Emmaus Road (University of South Carolina Press, 2013) at p. 41 A low Churchman, Meade believed in evangelism and missionary work. He preached the gospel of Christ Crucified like some of his Presbyterian neighbors. Unlike his neighboring bishops Whittingham of Maryland and Ravenscroft and Ives of North Carolina, Meade opposed the Oxford Movement as too \\"Romish\\" (particularly after Rt.Rev. Ives' conversion to Catholicism in 1855). Rt.Rev. Meade especially objected to doctrines of transubstantiation and prayers for the dead, which he thought inconsistent with salvation through grace. As bishop Meade actively participated in several episcopal disciplinary cases against high churchmen: against Bishop Henry Onderdonk (1789‚Äì1858) of Pennsylvania (who because of intemperance was forced to resign and temporarily suspended from the ministry) in 1844; against his younger brother Bishop Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk (1791‚Äì1861) of New York, who in 1845 was suspended from the ministry on the charge of improper conduct; and against Bishop George Washington Doane of New Jersey for misappropriation. Meade also disciplined at least one priest in Portsmouth for practices he believed excessive and akin to Catholicism. thumb In 1851, some Virginians in counties north and west of Meade's familial home wanted to secede from Virginia, politically as well as by selecting their own bishop. Bishop Meade pointed out that the section only had seven clergy, far less than the 30 required under church canons, and the proposal was defeated until after Meade's death. Views on slavery Meade freed his own slaves, who moved to Pennsylvania, since Virginia's laws at the time forbade emancipated slaves from remaining in the Commonwealth without special permission from the legislature.John Johns, A memoir of the Life of the Right Reverent William Meade, DD.

His views were influenced by his sister Ann Page (died 1838) as well as his clerical mentors (who both freed slaves). On December 21, 1816, Rev. Meade traveled to Washington, D.C. for the organizational meeting of the American Colonization Society (ACS), thus helping Rev. Robert Finley (a Presbyterian), Francis Scott Key and U.S. Supreme Court clerk Elias B. Caldwell (son of the \\"fighting chaplain of the third New Jersey regiment\\") establish that organization.Dorn at p. 39 In 1819, Virginia's diocesan convention strongly supported the ACS, and Meade (as ACS's agent) traveled through the American south campaigning for the removal of African American slaves to Africa.Jeffrey Robert Young (ed), Proslavery and Sectional Thought in the Early South, 1740‚Äì1829 (Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 2006), p. 198. In Georgia he purchased slaves illegally brought into the state and sold publicly at Milledgeville. However, Meade did not consider slavery a sin, merely a hindrance to economic growth. He believed Christian principles could teach masters to treat their slaves well. Thus, in 1813 Meade compiled and published a compilation of Christian proslavery tracts by authors including Anglican minister Thomas Bacon and Baptist Edmund Botsford.Young at p. 198 After his consecration, one of Meade's earliest pastoral letters (in 1834) concerned religious instruction for slaves. Beginning in 1833, Bishop Meade, Judge William Leigh of Halifax and lawyer Francis Scott Key administered the will of their friend John Randolph of Roanoke, who died without children and who in his final testament directed his executors to free his more than four hundred slaves. The executors fought for a decade through Virginia courts to enforce the will and provide the freed slaves land to support themselves.Leepson, Marc, What so Proudly We Hailed: Francis Scott Key, a life (Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 144 In 1841 Meade reported for a diocesan committee concerning the best means for instructing slaves, urging clergyman to devote at least part of each Sunday's sermon at slaves, or hold Sunday afternoon or weeknight services for them, and that if the could not catechize both white and black children, reserve those limited resources for slave children. Meade repeated the educational theme through his addresses and parochial reports, and in 1856 was criticized by an anonymous correspondent for remarks concerning slavery \\"in the presence of ten or twelve Negroes, who were candidates for confirmation.\\"Dorn at pp. 43‚Äì46 Meade convinced himself of the reciprocal nature of the master-slave relationship, and by 1857 published Christian proslavery tracts in his own name, declaring in his historical masterwork \\"If the evil passions are sometimes called into exercise, the milder virtues are much more frequently drawn forth.\\"Young at p. 199 citing William Meade, Old Churches, Ministers, and Families of Virginia, vol. 1, p. 91n. In 1858, his suffragan John Johns took charge of the committee and emphasized missionary work among slaves.Dorn at pp. 48‚Äì49 Johns later summarized Meade's position as disliking slavery and considering it politically disadvantageous to the country, but relying on his own experience concerning manumission's failures.Dorn at p. 50 citing Johns biography at p. 119 which mentions a Virginia resolution concerning the ACS, although better cite would be pp. 473‚Äì77 concerning the Petersburg/Brunswick controversy As Meade grew older, perhaps influenced by slave rebellions in Virginia, or his family's business interests, his views concerning slavery became more conservative. Biographer Johns stated that bishop Meade wrote to an American Tract Society meeting in New York opposing \\"an attempt ... made to introduce the leaven of New England fanaticism\\" and that Meade was unable to attend such meeting, but failed to mention the year the Tract Society's directors then defeated the abolitionist resolution.Johns at pp. 203‚Äì204 Meade's last will and testament contains no explicit bequests of slaves, although it does direct (among other bequests) his executor to spend $200 to purchase tracts from the Evangelical Knowledge Society, the American Tract Society and the American Sunday School Union to be distributed among descendants of his brothers R.K. Meade and David Meade, as well as $500 to (ACS missionary) Rev. Charles Wesley Andrews \\"to be expended in the manner directed in a paper or papers accompanying this will\\", as well as refers to two farms (Mountain View previously purchased by his son Philip Nelson Meade but who had not received a deed, and the adjacent Browers Farm and land in Missouri given to his three sons jointly with the expectation of sale and division between them).Last Will and Testament of Bishop Meade drafted on January 7, 1861 and submitted to probate in the City of Richmond on May 12, 1861, City of Richmond Circuit Court Will Book 2, at p. 25, including a codicil of the same date with specific bequests; also Copy of William Meade's Will in Clarke County Deed Book I, p. 311 Confederate bishop Meade fought against Virginians who threatened secession after the election of President Abraham Lincoln, preaching at Millwood against the looming civil war on June 13, nearly two months after Virginia's secession.Dorn at pp. 99‚Äì100 Still, Meade believed in state's rights and acquiesced in his beloved Commonwealth's ultimate decision to secede. Although near retirement (John Johns having become his suffragan decades earlier), Meade became a leading figure in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. In 1859, shortly after John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry (not very far down the historic Shenandoah Valley road from Meade's familial home and farm), the Episcopal Church held its General Convention in Richmond. There, the elderly Rt. Rev. Meade helped other southern bishops consecrate Henry Champlin Lay as a missionary bishop of the Southwest. Two years later, Bishop Meade as the senior seceding bishop, led the convention in Columbia, South Carolina in October 1861, which drew up the incorporation documents. However, he did not travel to Montgomery, Alabama for the preliminary organizational meeting July 3‚Äì6, 1861.Dorn p. 107-120 Thus, Bishop Stephen Elliott of Georgia became the Presiding Bishop of the Confederate Episcopal Church. On March 6, 1862, the elderly and infirm bishop returned to Richmond for the last time in order to assist his suffragan and Bishop Elliott in consecrating Wilmer's son, Richard Hooker Wilmer, as bishop of Alabama at St. Paul's Church. Bishop Meade had traveled by train from Gordonsville, along with his son, the Rev. Richard K. Meade, although coughing and obviously ill. He arrived at the church in time for the consecration, but afterward was confined to bed at a friend's home, and died days later. According to tradition, the dying Virginia bishop gave his last blessing to Confederate General Robert E. Lee, whom he had long known from the days both had lived and worshiped in Alexandria, and who was married to the daughter of his sister Ann Page's best friend. Bishop Meade was reputedly the only man who customarily called the general by his first name. Death and legacy Meade Memorial Church in White PostBishop Meade died in Richmond, Virginia, aged 72, on March 14, 1862. After a funeral at St. Paul's Church in Richmond, his body was placed in a vault in Hollywood Cemetery.Philip Slaughter, Memoir of the Life of the Rt. Rev. William Meade, pp. 37‚Äì38 (Boston: New England Historic Genealogical Society, 1885), available at google books The monument and remains were later moved to the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria. Not long after Meade's death, the counties adjacent to his home counties of Frederick and Clarke seceded from Virginia and became the state of West Virginia. The General Convention organized the Episcopal Diocese of West Virginia in 1877. Its first bishop, George William Peterkin, was a VTS graduate who had served with Meade's son in the Confederate army, and whose vocation Bishop Meade had fostered. Furthermore, Peterkin's long-serving successor at Baltimore's Memorial Church, Dr. William Meade Dame had been named in the bishop's honor. In 1868, Virginia's diocesan council authorized a church near the Meade family's estates in White Post, which was begun in 1872 under the direction of Rev. John Ravenscroft Jones (rector of Meade's home Cunninham Chapel Parish as well as disciplined for his Confederate sympathies by occupying Union forces) and consecrated in 1875. Although inactive for a time, it now again has an active congregation, as well as graveyard which contains many Meade family graves and a Confederate memorial.http://www.meadememorial.org/history.html Furthermore, in 1869, the rector of Christ Church in Alexandria, Randolph Harrison McKim (a former Confederate veteran), organized a mission church for African American Episcopalians in the city where Meade had long served. In 1870, Bishop Johns consecrated that church in honor of his mentor, Meade Memorial Church in Alexandria. Initially serviced by Rev. McKim and various VTS seminarians, it remains an active congregation.

Early life and career Doane was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He graduated from Union College, Schenectady, New York, in 1818. He did additional studies in theology and, in 1821, was ordained deacon. In 1823 he was ordained as an Episcopal priest by Bishop Hobart, whom he assisted in Trinity Church, New York. With George Upfold (1796‚Äì1872), Bishop of Indiana from 1849 to 1872, Doane founded St. Luke's in New York City. From 1824‚Äì1828 he was professor of belles-lettres in Washington, now Trinity College), Hartford, Connecticut. At this time, he was one of the editors of the Episcopal Watchman. He was assistant in 1828‚Äì1830 and rector in 1830‚Äì1832 of Trinity Church, Boston. Bishop of New Jersey Doane was called as second bishop of New Jersey, serving from October 1832 to his death in 1859 at Burlington, New Jersey. The diocese of New Jersey was an unpromising field, but he took up his work there with characteristic vigour. In 1837 he founded St. Mary's Hall (now Doane Academy), to provide a classical education for girls. It was the first such boarding school for girls in the United States, in a period when numerous schools for girls were founded. The school was supported in part by a gift from his wife, Eliza Greene Callahan (married firstly James Perkins; second George Washington Doane). In 1846 he founded Burlington College, a school for boys. These fulfilled his theory of education under church control. Because of national financial crises, his business management of these schools got the diocese heavily into debt. In the autumn of 1852, a charge of lax administration was made against him before a court of bishops, who dismissed it. Doane was shown to be an able and wise disciplinarian of these schools. His patriotic orations and sermons prove him a speaker of great power. He belonged to the High Church party and was a brilliant controversialist. He published Songs by the Way (1824), a volume of poems. He also wrote hymns, and his pieces beginning \\"Softly now the light of day\\" and \\"Thou art the Way\\" are well known. He commissioned John Notman to build a chapel for St. Mary's Hall. The congregation of St. Mary's Church grew, and he commissioned architect Richard Upjohn to design a new St. Mary's Church, his episcopal seat, completed in 1856. Both buildings have been recognized as National Historic Landmarks. Death and legacy Among those whom Doane ordained was Joseph Wolff, a Jewish Christian missionary. Doane's biography and bibliography, Life and Writings of George Washington Doane (4 vols, New York, 1860‚Äì1861), was edited by his son, William Croswell Doane (1832‚Äì1913). He followed his father into the clergy and was called as the first Bishop of Albany. The fact that both Doane and his son became \\"bishops [was] a situation possibly not unique but certainly rare enough to be remarked upon.\\"James Gwynn, \\"Like Father, Like Son,\\" Swan & Elk (newsletter of the Cathedral of All Saints, Albany, New York), Fall 2012, p. 11. Doane died in 1859. He was buried in Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard in Burlington.George Washington Doane , Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard. Accessed August 21, 2007. Founded in 1837 and now known as Doane Academy, the private school he founded is coeducational, serving grades Pre-K through 12, and has a substantial endowment to ensure its future. It was the first academic, church run school for girls in the United States.

Stems tend to be narrow or even wiry; leaves are evergreen in most species, arranged in opposite pairs, oval, entire, and small, 4‚Äì20 mm long, and usually aromatic. Thyme flowers are in dense terminal heads with an uneven calyx, with the upper lip three-lobed, and are yellow, white, or purple. Several members of the genus are cultivated as culinary herbs or ornamentals, when they are also called thyme after its best-known species, Thymus vulgaris or common thyme. Thymus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) insect species, including Chionodes distinctella and the Coleophora case-bearers C. lixella, C. niveicostella, C. serpylletorum, and C. struella (the latter three feed exclusively on Thymus). Classification A considerable amount of confusion has existed in the naming of thymes. Many nurseries use common names rather than binomial names, which can lead to mix- ups. For example golden thyme, lemon thyme, and creeping thyme are all common names for more than one cultivar. Some confusion remains over the naming and taxonomy of some species, and Margaret Easter (who holds the NCCPG National Plant Collection of thymes in the UK) has compiled a list of synonyms for cultivated species and cultivars. The most common classification is that used by Jalas, in eight sections: * Micantes: Iberian Peninsula and north Africa, includes T. caespititius * Mastichina: Iberian Peninsula, includes T. mastichina * Piperella: Monotypic section confined to the vicinity of Valencia, Spain * Teucrioides: Balkan Peninsula * Pseudothymbra: Iberian Peninsula and north Africa, includes T. cephalotos, T. longiflorus and T. membranaceus * Thymus: Western Mediterranean region, includes T. camphoratus, T. carnosus, T. hyemalis, T. vulgaris and T. zygis * Hyphodromi: Throughout the Mediterranean region, includes T. cilicicus and T. comptus * Serpyllum: The largest section, throughout whole region, apart from Madeira and Azores, includes T. comosus, T. doerfleri, T. herba-barona, T. longicaulis, T. pannonicus, T. praecox, T. pulegioides, T. quinquecostatus, T. richardii, T. serpyllum, T. sibthorpii and T. thracicus Species About 350 species, including: * Thymus adamovicii * Thymus altaicus * Thymus amurensis * Thymus boissieri * Thymus bracteosus * Thymus broussonetii * Thymus caespititius * Thymus camphoratus * Thymus capitatus * Thymus capitellatus * Thymus camphoratus * Thymus carnosus * Thymus cephalotus * Thymus cherlerioides * Thymus ciliatus * Thymus cilicicus * Thymus cimicinus * Thymus citriodorus (Thymus √ó citriodorus) syn.

History The company originated from two successful travel agencies established in the 1890s, the Polytechnic Touring Association and Sir Henry Lunn Travel. Both firms were acquired in the 1950s by the British Eagle airline group, and combined into Lunn Poly in 1965. It became a nationalised industry as part of the Transport Holding Company (THC). In June 1971, Sunair bought Lunn Poly from the THC for ¬£175,000. In 1972, the company became part of Thomson Travel Group. Lunn Poly became an early trade innovator, by splitting its leisure and business travel. High street shops concentrated on package holidays, specialized offices were structured to serve the needs of business and industry. This business model was highly successful throughout the 1970s and 1980s. By the mid-1990s it was the largest travel agency in the UK. When TUI UK, which had acquired Thomson Travel, rebranded Britannia Airways as Thomsonfly in November 2003, the company insisted that there were no plans to rebrand Lunn Poly. On 2 November 2004, however, the announcement was made that all 800 Lunn Poly shops in the United Kingdom were to be rebranded as Thomson. Lunn Poly was famous for a long running advertising campaign on television. These commercials featured people looking into what holidays the company offered. Another person would then say to them in disbelief \\"Lunn Poly? Get away!\\", at which point the person would disappear into thin air and end up at a vacation spot.

Baer, available at http://www.wisebrain.org/papers/MindfulnessPsyTx.pdfAmerican Psychological Association (APA.org, 2012); Kabat-Zinn, in Purser, 2015; as cited at PositivePsychology.com, What Is Mindfulness? Definition + Benefits (Incl. Psychology). a skill one develops through meditation or other training. Mindfulness derives from sati, a significant element of Buddhist traditions, and based on Zen, VipassanƒÅ, and Tibetan meditation techniques. Though definitions and techniques of mindfulness are wide-ranging, Buddhist traditions explain what constitutes mindfulness such as how past, present and future moments arise and cease as momentary sense impressions and mental phenomena. Individuals who have contributed to the popularity of mindfulness in the modern Western context include Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh (1926‚Äì ), Herbert Benson (1935‚Äì ), Jon Kabat-Zinn (1944‚Äì ), and Richard J. Davidson (1951‚Äì ). Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people experiencing a variety of psychological conditions. Mindfulness practice has been employed to reduce depression, to reduce stress, anxiety, and in the treatment of drug addiction. Programs based on mindfulness models have been adopted within schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans' centers, and other environments, and mindfulness programs have been applied for additional outcomes such as for healthy aging, weight management, athletic performance, helping children with special needs, and as an intervention during the perinatal period. Clinical studies have documented both physical- and mental-health benefits of mindfulness in different patient categories as well as in healthy adults and children. Research studies have shown a positive relationship between trait mindfulness (which can be cultivated through the practice of mindfulness-based interventions) and psychological health. The practice of mindfulness appears to provide therapeutic benefits to people with psychiatric disorders, including moderate benefits to those with psychosis. Studies also indicate that rumination and worry contribute to a variety of mental disorders, and that mindfulness-based interventions can enhance trait mindfulness and reduce both rumination and worry. Further, the practice of mindfulness may be a preventive strategy to halt the development of mental-health problems. There is also evidence that suggests engaging in mindfulness meditation may influence physical health. For example, the psychological habit of repeatedly dwelling on stressful thoughts (i.e., rumination) appears to intensify the physiological effects of the stressor (as a result of the continual activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis) with the potential to lead to physical health related clinical manifestations. Studies indicate that mindfulness meditation, which brings about reductions in rumination, may alter these biological clinical pathways. Further, research indicates that mindfulness may favourably influence the immune system as well as inflammation, which can consequently impact physical health, especially considering that inflammation has been linked to the development of several chronic health conditions. Other studies support these findings. Additionally, mindfulness appears to bring about lowered activity of the default mode network of the brain, and thereby contribute towards a lowered risk of developing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, critics have questioned both the commercialization and the over-marketing of mindfulness for health benefits‚Äîas well as emphasizing the need for more randomized controlled studies, for more methodological details in reported studies and for the use of larger sample-sizes. Practice Mindfulness practice involves the process of developing the skill of bringing one's attention to whatever is happening in the present moment. =Watching the breath, body-scan and other techniques= There are several exercises designed to develop mindfulness meditation, which are aided by guided meditations \\"to get the hang of it\\".Kabat-Zinn himself, in Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition) (2013), p. lxiv * One method is to sit in a straight-backed chair or sit cross-legged on the floor or a cushion, close one's eyes and bring attention to either the sensations of breathing in the proximity of one's nostrils or to the movements of the abdomen when breathing in and out. In this meditation practice, one does not try to control one's breathing, but attempts to simply be aware of one's natural breathing process/rhythm. When engaged in this practice, the mind will often run off to other thoughts and associations, and if this happens, one passively notices that the mind has wandered, and in an accepting, non-judgmental way, returns to focusing on breathing. * In body- scan meditation the attention is directed at various areas of the body and noting body sensations that happen in the present moment. * One could also focus on sounds, sensations, thoughts, feelings and actions that happen in the present. In this regard, a famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his MBSR program, is the mindful tasting of a raisin, in which a raisin is being tasted and eaten mindfully. By enabling reconnection with internal hunger and satiety cues, mindful eating has been suggested to be a means of maintaining healthy and conscious eating patterns. * Other approaches include practising yoga asanas while attending to movements and body sensations, and walking meditation. =Timings= Meditators are recommended to start with short periods of 10 minutes or so of meditation practice per day. As one practices regularly, it becomes easier to keep the attention focused on breathing. =In Buddhist context; moral precepts= In a Buddhist context the keeping of moral precepts is an essential preparatory stage for mindfulness or meditation.MahƒÅsi SayƒÅdaw, Manual of Insight, Chapter 5 Vipassana also includes contemplation and reflection on phenomena as dukkha, anatta and anicca, and reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings.Mahasi Sayadaw, Practical Vipassana Instructions, pp. 22‚Äì27  Translations  Mindfulness meditation is part of Buddhist psychological traditions and the developing scholarship within empirical psychology. =Sati and sm·πõti= The Buddhist term translated into English as \\"mindfulness\\" originates in the Pali term sati and in its Sanskrit counterpart sm·πõti. It is often translated as \\"bare attention\\", but in the Buddhist tradition it has a broader meaning and application, and the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion. According to Bryan Levman, \\"the word sati incorporates the meaning of 'memory' and 'remembrance' in much of its usage in both the suttas and the [traditional Buddhist] commentary, and ... without the memory component, the notion of mindfulness cannot be properly understood or applied, as mindfulness requires memory for its effectiveness\\". According to Robert Sharf, sm·πõti originally meant \\"to remember\\", \\"to recollect\\", \\"to bear in mind\\", as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred texts. The term sati also means \\"to remember\\". In the Satipa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna-sutta the term sati means to remember the dharmas, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen. Sharf refers to the Milindapa√±ha, which explained that the arising of sati calls to mind the wholesome dhammas such as the four foundations of mindfulness, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening-factors, the noble eightfold path, and the attainment of insight. According to Rupert Gethin, Sharf further notes that this has little to do with \\"bare attention\\", the popular contemporary interpretation of sati, \\"since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise.\\" Georges Dreyfus has also expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as \\"bare attention\\" or \\"nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present- centered awareness\\", stressing that mindfulness in a Buddhist context also means \\"remembering\\", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information. Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of \\"correct view\\", not just \\"bare attention\\". Jay L. Garfield, quoting Shantideva and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, calling to mind and vigilantly retaining in mind. He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of moralityat least in the context of Buddhism, from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.\\"Mindfulness and Ethics: Attention, Virtue and Perfection\\" by Jay Garfield =Translation= The Pali-language scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843‚Äì1922) first translated sati in 1881 as English mindfulness in sammƒÅ-sati \\"Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind\\". Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered sammƒÅ-sati as \\"correct meditation\\", Davids explained: =Alternative translations= John D. Dunne asserts that the translation of sati and sm·πõti as mindfulness is confusing. A number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish \\"retention\\" as the preferred alternative. Bhikkhu Bodhi also points to the meaning of sati as \\"memory\\". The terms sati/sm·πõti have been translated as: * Attention (Jack Kornfield) * Awareness * Concentrated attention (Mahasi Sayadaw) * Inspection (Herbert V. G√ºnther) * Mindful attention * Mindfulness * Recollecting mindfulness (Alexander Berzin) * Recollection (Erik Pema Kunsang, Buddhadasa) * Reflective awareness (Buddhadasa) * Remindfulness (James H. Austin)James H. Austin (2014), Zen-Brain Horizons: Toward a Living Zen, MIT Press, p. 83 * Retention * Self-recollection (Jack Kornfield) Definitions =Psychology= A.M. Hayes and G. Feldman have highlighted that mindfulness can be seen as a strategy that stands in contrast to a strategy of avoidance of emotion on the one hand and to the strategy of emotional over-engagement on the other hand. Mindfulness can also be viewed as a means to develop self- knowledge and wisdom. Trait, state and practice According to Brown, Ryan, and Creswell, definitions of mindfulness are typically selectively interpreted based on who is studying it and how it is applied. Some have viewed mindfulness as a mental state, while others have viewed it as a set of skills and techniques. A distinction can also be made between the state of mindfulness and the trait of mindfulness. According to David S. Black, whereas \\"mindfulness\\" originally was associated with esoteric beliefs and religion, and \\"a capacity attainable only by certain people\\", scientific researchers have translated the term into measurable terms, providing a valid operational definition of mindfulness. Black mentions three possible domains: # A trait, a dispositional characteristic (a relatively long lasting trait), a person's tendency to more frequently enter into and more easily abide in mindful states; # A state, an outcome (a state of awareness resulting from mindfulness training), being in a state of present-moment awareness; # A practice (mindfulness meditation practice itself). =Trait-like constructs= According to Brown, mindfulness is: Several mindfulness measures have been developed which are based on self-reporting of trait-like constructs: * Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) * Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) * Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS) * Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS) * Mindfulness Questionnaire (MQ) * Revised Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS-R) * Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS) =State-like phenomenon= According to Bishop, et alia, mindfulness is, \\"A kind of nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional field is acknowledged and accepted as it is.\\" * The Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) measures mindfulness as a state-like phenomenon, that is evoked and maintained by regular practice. * The State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) is a 21-item survey with an overall state mindfulness scale, and 2 sub- scales (state mindfulness of mind, and state mindfulness of body). Mindfulness-practice Mindfulness as a practice is described as: * \\"Mindfulness is a way of paying attention that originated in Eastern meditation practices\\"Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999, p. 68 * \\"Paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally\\" * \\"Bringing one‚Äôs complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to- moment basis\\" According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises. Formal mindfulness, or meditation, is the practice of sustaining attention on body, breath or sensations, or whatever arises in each moment. Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life. Nonmeditation-based exercises are specifically used in dialectical behavior therapy and in acceptance and commitment therapy. =Definitions arising in modern teaching of meditation= Since the 1970s, most books on meditation use definitions of mindfulness similar to Jon Kabat-Zinn's definition as \\"present moment awareness\\". However, recently a number of teachers of meditation have proposed quite different definitions of mindfulness. Shinzen Young says a person is mindful when they have mindful awareness, and defines that to be when \\"concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity [are] working together.\\"From 'See, Hear, Feel: An Introduction', draft 1.8., https://www.shinzen.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/08/SeeHearFeelIntroduction_ver1.8.pdf John Yates (Culadasa) defines mindfulness to be \\"the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness\\", where he distinguishes attention and peripheral awareness as two distinct modes in which one may be conscious of things.p. 30, The Mind Illuminated, Culadasa with Immergut and Graves, Hay House, 2015. = Buddhism = According to American Buddhist monk Ven Bhante Vimalaramsi's book A Guide to Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation, the term mindfulness is often interpreted differently than what was originally formulated by the Buddha. In the context of Buddhism, he offers the following definition: =Other usages= The English term mindfulness already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context. It was first recorded as myndfulness in 1530 (John Palsgrave translates French pens√©e), as mindfulnesse in 1561, and mindfulness in 1817. Morphologically earlier terms include mindful (first recorded in 1340), mindfully (1382), and the obsolete mindiness (c. 1200).Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., 2002 According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, mindfulness may also refer to \\"a state of being aware\\". Synonyms for this \\"state of being aware\\" are wakefulness, attention, alertness, prudence, conscientiousness, awareness, consciousness, and observation. Models and frameworks for mindfulness practices = Two- component model = In a paper that described a consensus among clinical psychologists on an operational and testable definition, Bishop, Lau, et al. (2004) proposed a two-component model of mindfulness: In this two-component model, self-regulated attention (the first component) \\"involves bringing awareness to current experience‚Äîobserving and attending to the changing fields of \\"objects\\" (thoughts, feelings, sensations), from moment to moment ‚Äì by regulating the focus of attention\\". Orientation to experience (the second component) involves maintaining an attitude of curiosity about objects experienced at each moment, and about where and how the mind wanders when it drifts from the selected focus of attention. Clients are asked to avoid trying to produce a particular state (e.g. relaxation), but rather to just notice each object that arises in the stream of consciousness. = The five-aggregate model = An ancient model of the mind, generally known as the five-aggregate model enables one to understand the moment-to-moment manifestation of subjective conscious experience, and therefore can be a potentially useful theoretical resource to guide mindfulness interventions. The five aggregates are described as follows: # Material form: includes both the physical body and external matter where material elements are continuously moving to and from the material body. # Feelings: can be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. # Perceptions: represent being aware of attributes of an object (e.g. color, shape, etc.) # Volition: represents bodily, verbal, or psychological behavior. # Sensory consciousness: refers to input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations) or a thought that happens to arise in the mind. This model describes how sensory consciousness results in the generation of feelings, perception or volition, and how individuals‚Äô previously conditioned attitudes and past associations influence this generation. The five aggregates are described as constantly arising and ceasing in the present moment. = Cultivating self-knowledge and wisdom = The practice of mindfulness can be utilized to gradually develop self- knowledge and wisdom. In this regard, Buddhist teachings provide detailed instructions on how one can carry out an inquiry into the nature of the mind, and this guidance can help one to make sense of one's subjective experience. This could include understanding what the ‚Äúpresent moment‚Äù is, how various thoughts, etc., arise following input from the senses, the conditioned nature of thoughts, and other realizations. In Buddhist teachings, ultimate wisdom refers to gaining deep insight into all phenomena or ‚Äúseeing things as they are.‚Äù Historical development =Buddhism= Mindfulness as a modern, Western practice is founded on Zen and modern vipassana, and involves the training of sati, which means \\"moment to moment awareness of present events\\", but also \\"remembering to be aware of something\\". Early Buddhism Sati is one of the seven factors of enlightenment. \\"Correct\\" or \\"right\\" mindfulness (Pali: sammƒÅ-sati, Sanskrit samyak-sm·πõti) is the seventh element of the noble eightfold path. Mindfulness is an antidote to delusion and is considered as a 'power' (Pali: bala) which contributes to the attainment of nirvana. This faculty becomes a power in particular when it is coupled with clear comprehension of whatever is taking place. Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and delusion (Pali: moha) have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind. According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way in early Buddhism to liberation, \\"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.\\" According to Vetter, dhyana may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness. According to Thomas William Rhys Davids, the doctrine of mindfulness is \\"perhaps the most important\\" after the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. T.W. Rhys Davids viewed the teachings of Gotama as a rational technique for self- actualization and rejected a few parts of it, mainly the doctrine of rebirth, as residual superstitions. Zazen The aim of zazen is just sitting, that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them. Contemporary vipassana-meditation In modern vipassana-meditation, as propagated by the Vipassana movement, sati aids vipassana, insight into the true nature of reality, namely the three marks of existence, the impermanence of and the unsatisfactoriness of every conditioned thing that exists, and non-self. With this insight, the practitioner becomes a so-called SotƒÅpanna, a \\"stream- enterer\\", the first stage on the path to liberation. Vipassana is practiced in tandem with samatha, and also plays a central role in other Buddhist traditions. According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, samatha is used as a preparation for vipassanƒÅ, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation. VipassanƒÅ-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after TheravƒÅda Buddhism meditation practices, which employs vipassanƒÅ and ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅna meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the Sutta. =Anapanasati, satipa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna, and vipassana= Anapanasati is mindfulness of breathing. \\"Sati\\" means mindfulness; \\"ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅna\\" refers to inhalation and exhalation. Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body. The Anapanasati Sutta gives an exposition on this practice. Satipa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna is the establishment of mindfulness in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of one's body, feelings, mind, and dharmas. The practice of mindfulness supports analysis resulting in the arising of wisdom (Pali: pa√±√±ƒÅ, Sanskrit: praj√±ƒÅ). =Sampraja√±a, apramƒÅda and atappa= In contemporary Theravada practice, \\"mindfulness\\" also includes sampraja√±a, meaning \\"clear comprehension\\" and apramƒÅda meaning \\"vigilance\\". All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as \\"mindfulness\\", but they all have specific shades of meaning. In a publicly available correspondence between Bhikkhu Bodhi and B. Alan Wallace, Bodhi has described Ven. Nyanaponika Thera's views on \\"right mindfulness\\" and sampaja√±√±a as follows: Monitoring mental processes According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact. According to Grzegorz Polak, the four upassanƒÅ (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four upassanƒÅ do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness: * the six sense-bases which one needs to be aware of (kƒÅyƒÅnupassanƒÅ); * contemplation on vedanƒÅs, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (vedanƒÅnupassanƒÅ); * the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittƒÅnupassanƒÅ); * the development from the five hindrances to the seven factors of enlightenment (dhammƒÅnupassanƒÅ). =Transcendentalism= Mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn refers to Thoreau as a predecessor of the interest in mindfulness, together with other eminent Transcendentalists such as Emerson and Whitman: The forms of Asian religion and spirituality which were introduced in the west were themselves influenced by Transcendentalism and other 19th-century manifestations of Western esotericism. Transcendentalism was closely connected to the Unitarian Church, which in India collaborated with Ram Mohan Roy (1772‚Äì1833) and his Brahmo Samaj. He found that Unitarianism came closest to true Christianity, and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians. This influence worked through on Vivekananda, whose modern but idiosyncratic interpretation of Hinduism became widely popular in the west. Vipassana meditation, presented as a centuries-old meditation system, was a 19th-century reinvention, which gained popularity in south-east due to the accessibility of the Buddhist sutras through English translations from the Pali Text Society. It was brought to western attention in the 19th century by the Theosophical Society. Zen Buddhism first gained popularity in the west through the writings of D.T. Suzuki, who attempted to present a modern interpretation of Zen, adjusted to western tastes. =Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR= In 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill.\\"The Stress Reduction Program, founded by Dr. Jon Kabat- Zinn in 1979...\\" - http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx This program sparked the application of mindfulness ideas and practices in Medicine\\"Much of the interest in the clinical applications of mindfulness has been sparked by the introduction of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a manualized treatment program originally developed for the management of chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, & Burney, 1985; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, & Sellers, 1987).\\" - Bishop et al, 2004, \\"Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition\\" for the treatment of a variety of conditions in both healthy and unhealthy people. MBSR and similar programs are now widely applied in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments. Mindfulness practices were inspired mainly by teachings from the Eastern World, particularly from Buddhist traditions. Kabat-Zinn was first introduced to meditation by Philip Kapleau, a Zen missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Zen-Buddhist teachers such as Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh and Seungsahn. He also studied at the Insight Meditation Society and eventually taught there. One of MBSR's techniques‚Äîthe \\"body scan\\"‚Äîwas derived from a meditation practice (\\"sweeping\\") of the Burmese U Ba Khin tradition, as taught by S. N. Goenka in his Vipassana retreats, which he began in 1976. The body scan method has since been widely adapted to secular settings, independent of religious or cultural contexts. Kabat-Zinn was also influenced by the book The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James, which suggested that religions pointed toward the same experience, and which 1960s counterculture figures interpreted as meaning that the same universal, experiential truth could be reached in different ways, including via non-religious activities. =Popularization, \\"mindfulness movement\\"= Mindfulness is gaining a growing popularity as a practice in daily life, apart from Buddhist insight meditation and its application in clinical psychology. In this context mindfulness is defined as moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, characterized mainly by \\"acceptance\\"‚Äîattention to thoughts and feelings without judging whether they are right or wrong. Mindfulness focuses the human brain on what is being sensed at each moment, instead of on its normal rumination on the past or the future. Mindfulness may be seen as a mode of being, and can be practiced outside a formal setting. The terminology used by scholars of religion, scientists, journalists, and popular media writers to describe this movement of mindfulness \\"popularization,\\" and the many new contexts of mindfulness practice which have cropped up, has regularly evolved over the past 20 years, with some criticisms arising. Applications According to Jon Kabat-Zinn the practice of mindfulness may be beneficial to many people in Western society who might be unwilling to adopt Buddhist traditions or vocabulary. Western researchers and clinicians who have introduced mindfulness practice into mental health treatment programs usually teach these skills independently of the religious and cultural traditions of their origins.Mindfulness Training as a Clinical Intervention: A Conceptual and Empirical Review by Ruth A. Baer Programs based on MBSR and similar models have been widely adopted in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments. =Therapy programs= Mindfulness-based stress reduction Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a mindfulness-based program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga to help people become more mindful. While MBSR has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is secular. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a psychological therapy designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with Major depressive disorder (MDD). It uses traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression. Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them. Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode. The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment. This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. Research supports the effects of MBCT in people who have been depressed three or more times and demonstrates reduced relapse rates by 50%.  Mindfulness-based pain management  Mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) providing specific applications for people living with chronic pain and illness. Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the practice of 'loving-kindness', and has been seen as sensitive to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework within Buddhism. It was developed by Vidyamala Burch and is delivered through the programs of Breathworks. It has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness. Acceptance and commitment therapy Acceptance and commitment therapy or (ACT) (typically pronounced as the word \\"act\\") is a form of clinical behavior analysis (CBA) used in psychotherapy. It is a psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies mixed in different ways with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility. The approach was originally called comprehensive distancing. It was developed in the late 1980sMurdock, N. L. (2009). Theories of counseling and psychotherapy: A case approach. Upper Saddle River, N.J: Merrill/Pearson by Steven C. Hayes, Kelly G. Wilson, and Kirk Strosahl. Dialectical behavior therapy Mindfulness is a \\"core\\" exercise used in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a psychosocial treatment Marsha M. Linehan developed for treating people with borderline personality disorder. DBT is dialectic, explains Linehan,Linehan 1993, p.19 in the sense of \\"the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis.\\" As a practitioner of Buddhist meditation techniques, Linehan says: Mode deactivation therapy Mode deactivation therapy (MDT) is a treatment methodology that is derived from the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy and incorporates elements of Acceptance and commitment therapy, Dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness techniques. Mindfulness techniques such as simple breathing exercises are applied to assist the client in awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of unpleasant and distressing thoughts and feelings as they occur in the present moment. Mode Deactivation Therapy was developed and is established as an effective treatment for adolescents with problem behaviors and complex trauma-related psychological problems, according to recent publications by Jack A. Apsche and Joan Swart. Other programs Since 2006, research supports promising mindfulness-based therapies for a number of medical and psychiatric conditions, notably chronic pain (McCracken et al. 2007), stress (Grossman et al. 2004), anxiety and depression (Hofmann et al. 2010), substance abuse (Melemis 2008:141-157), and recurrent suicidal behavior (Williams et al. 2006). Bell (2009) gives a brief overview of mindful approaches to therapy, particularly family therapy, starting with a discussion of mysticism and emphasizing the value of a mindful therapist. ;Morita therapy The Japanese psychiatrist Shoma Morita, who trained in Zen meditation, developed Morita therapy upon principles of mindfulness and non-attachment. ;Adaptation Practice The British doctor Clive Sherlock developed Adaptation Practice in 1977. Adaptation Practice is a structured program of self-discipline. ;Hakomi therapy Hakomi therapy, under development by Ron Kurtz and others, is a somatic psychology based upon Asian philosophical precepts of mindfulness and nonviolence. ;IFS Internal Family Systems Model (IFS), developed by Richard C. Schwartz, emphasizes the importance of both therapist and client engaging in therapy from the Self, which is the IFS term for one's \\"spiritual center\\". The Self is curious about whatever arises in one's present experience and open and accepting toward all manifestations. ;Mindfulness relaxation Mindfulness relaxation uses breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress. =Schools= In 2012 Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio published A Mindful Nation, and received a $1 million federal grant to teach mindfulness in schools in his home district. Mindful Kids Miami is a tax-exempt, 501 (c)(3), non-profit corporation established in 2011 dedicated to making age-appropriate mindfulness training available to school children in Miami-Dade County public and private schools. This is primarily accomplished by training educators and other childcare providers to incorporate mindfulness practices in the children's daily activities. In 2000, The Inner Kids Program, a mindfulness-based program developed for children, was introduced into public and private school curricula in the greater Los Angeles area.http://www.susankaisergreenland.com/inner-kids.html MindUP, a classroom- based program spearheaded by Goldie Hawn's Hawn Foundation, teaches students to self-regulate behavior and mindfully engage in focused concentration required for academic success. For the last decade, MindUP has trained teachers in over 1,000 schools in cities from Arizona to Washington. The Holistic Life Foundation, a non-profit organization that created an in-school mindfulness program called Mindful Moment, is currently serving almost 350 students daily at Robert W. Coleman Elementary School and approximately 1300 students at Patterson Park High School in Baltimore, Maryland. At Patterson High School, the Mindful Moment program engages the school's faculty along with the students during a 15-minute mindfulness practice at the beginning and end of each school day. Mindful Life Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 based out of Richmond, California, teaches mindfulness to elementary school students in underserved schools in the South Richmond school district. Utilizing curriculum, ‚ÄúRise-Up‚Äù is a regular school day intervention program serving 430 students weekly, while ‚ÄúMindful Community‚Äù is currently implemented at six South Richmond partner schools. These in-school mindfulness programs have been endorsed by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who has recommended additional funding to expand the program in order to serve all Richmond youth. = Education = Mindfulness practices are becoming more common within educational institutions including Elementary and Secondary schools. This has been referred to as part of a 'contemplative turn' in education that has emerged since the turn of the millennium. The applications of mindfulness in schools are aimed at calming and relaxation of students as well as for students and educators to build compassion and empathy for others. An additional benefit to Mindfulness in education is for the practice to reduce anxiety and stress in students. Based on a broad meta-analytical review, scholars argued that the application of mindfulness practice enhances the goals of education in the 21st century, which include adapting to a rapidly changing world and being a caring and committed citizen. Within educational systems, the application of mindfulness practices shows an improvement of students' attention and focus, emotional regulation, creativity, and problem solving skills. As discussed by Ergas and Todd, the development of this field since the turn of the millennium has brought diverse possibilities as well as complexities, given the origins of mindfulness within Buddhism and the processes of its secularization and measurement based on science. Renshaw and Cook state, ‚ÄúAs scientific interest in the utility of Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) in schools grew steadily, popular interest in mindfulness in schools seemed to grow exponentially‚Äù. Despite research on mindfulness being comparatively unexamined, especially with young students, the practice has seen a spike in use within the educational arena. ‚ÄúA relatively recent addition to discourse around preventing school expulsion and failure, mindfulness is gaining popularity for its potential to improve students‚Äô social, emotional, behavioral, and learning-related cognitive control, thereby improving academic outcomes‚Äù. Researchers and educators are interested in how mindfulness can provide optimal conditions for a students‚Äô personal development and academic success. Current research on mindfulness in education is limited but can provide insight into the potential benefits for students, and areas of improvement for future studies. Mindfulness in the classroom is being touted as a promising new intervention tool for young students. According to Choudhury and Moses, ‚ÄúAlthough still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, social-emotional learning in ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù children and youth, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration‚Äù. Emerging research is concerned with studying teachers and programs using mindfulness practices with students and is discovering tension arising from the moral reframing of eastern practices in western school settings. As cited by Renshaw and Cook, ‚ÄúUnlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions‚Äù. Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs. Yet, MBIs continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, ‚ÄúMindfulness practices, particularly in relation to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche ‚Äì one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future‚Äù. As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù and ‚Äúresults‚Äù of MBIs are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection. Available research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention. Semple, Lee, Rosa, & Miller argue, ‚ÄúAnxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety‚Äù. They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems. In addition, Flook shows how an eight-week mindfulness awareness program was evaluated in a random and controlled school setting and measured the effects of awareness practices on executive functions in elementary school children. Their findings concluded, ‚ÄúParticipation in the mindfulness awareness program was associated with improvements in behavioral regulation, metacognition, and overall executive functions‚Äù. In the study by Flook, parents and teachers completed questionnaires which propose that participation in mindfulness programs is associated with improvements in child behavioral regulation. These perspectives are a valuable source of data given that caregivers and educators interact with the children daily and across a variety of settings. According to Eklund, Omalley, and Meyer, ‚ÄúSchool-based practitioners should find promise in the evidence supporting mindfulness-based practices with children, parents, and educators‚Äù. Lastly, a third study by Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, and Walach concluded, ‚ÄúAnalysis suggest that mindfulness-based interventions for children and youths are able to increase cognitive capacity of attending and learning by nearly one standard deviation and yield‚Äù. Application of Mindfulness-Based Interventions continue to increase in popularity and practice. Mindfulness-Based Interventions are rising across western culture, but its effectiveness in school programs is still being determined. Research contends, ‚ÄúMindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people‚Äù. Although much of the available studies find a high number of mindfulness acceptability among students and teachers, more research needs to be conducted on its effects on well-being and mental health for students. In a firmly controlled experiment, Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade evaluated ‚Äúthe impact of an existing and widely available school-based mindfulness program\\". According to their research, \\"no improvements were demonstrated on any outcome measured either immediately post-intervention or at three-month follow-up‚Äù. Many questions remain on which practices best implement effective and reliable mindfulness programs at schools, and further research is needed to identify the optimal methods and measurement tools for mindfulness in education. =Business= Mindfulness training appears to be getting popular in the business world, and many large corporations have been incorporating mindfulness practices into their culture.Boyatzis, R. E., & McKee, A. (2005). Resonant Leadership: Renewing yourself and connecting with others through mindfulness, hope, and compassion. Boston: Harvard Business School Press. For example, companies such as Google, Apple, Procter & Gamble, General Mills, Mayo Clinic, and the U.S. Army offer mindfulness coaching, meditation breaks and other resources to their employees to improve workplace functioning. The introduction of mindfulness in corporate settings still remains in early stages and its potential long-term impact requires further assessment. Mindfulness has been found to result in better employee well-being, lower levels of frustration, lower absenteeism and burnout as well as an improved overall work environment. Since high levels of mindfulness correlate with ethical decision-making and increased personal awareness and emotional regulation, mindfulness training has been suggested as a way to promote ethical intentions and behavior for business students. =Law= Legal and law enforcement organizations are also showing interest in mindfulness:Meditation classes raise attorneys mindfulness (2009). New Orleans CityBusiness. * Harvard Law School's Program on Negotiation hosted a workshop on \\"Mindfulness in the Law & Alternative Dispute Resolution.\\"Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School (2008). Program on Negotiation Webcasts. * Many law firms offer mindfulness classes. =Prison- programs= Mindfulness has been taught in prisons, reducing hostility and mood disturbance among inmates, and improving their self-esteem. Additional studies indicate that mindfulness interventions can result in significant reductions in anger, reductions in substance use, increased relaxation capacity, self-regulation and optimism. =Government= Many government organizations offer mindfulness training. Coping Strategies is an example of a program utilized by United States Armed Forces personnel. The British Parliament organized a mindfulness-session for its members in 2014, led by Ruby Wax. Scientific research =Effects and efficacy of mindfulness practice= Mindfulness has gained increasing empirical attention since 1970 and has been studied often as an intervention for stress reduction. Meta analyses indicate its beneficial effects for healthy adults, for adolescents and children, as well as for different health-related outcomes including weight management, psychiatric conditions, heart disease, sleep disorders, cancer care, adult autism treatment, and other health-related conditions. An often-cited meta-analysis on meditation research published in JAMA in 2014, found insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight, but found that there is moderate evidence that meditation reduces anxiety, depression, and pain. However, this study included a highly heterogeneous group of meditation styles (i.e., it did not focus exclusively on mindfulness meditation), which is a significant limitation of this study. Thousands of studies on meditation have been conducted, though the methodological quality of some of the studies is poor. Recent reviews have pointed out many of these issues. Nonetheless, mindfulness meditation is a popular subject for research, and many present potential benefits for a wide array of conditions and outcomes. For example, the practice of mindfulness has also been used to improve athletic performance,, as a beneficial intervention for children with special needs and their caregivers, as a viable treatment option for people with insomnia an effective intervention for healthy aging, as a strategy for managing dermatological conditions and as a useful intervention during pregnancy and the perinatal period. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates physical pain through multiple, unique mechanisms. Meditation also may allow one to modulate pain. When exposed to pain from heating, the brain scans of the mindfulness meditation participants (by use of functional magnetic resonance imaging) showed their brains notice the pain equally, however it does not get converted to a perceived pain signal. As such they experienced up to 40‚Äì50% less pain. Further, mindfulness meditation also appears to lead to increased telomere length, which is an important finding considering that short telomeres can be a risk factor for the development of several chronic health conditions. Research has also investigated mindful movements and mindful exercises for different patient populations. Mindfulness-based approaches are a major subject of increasing research interest, 52 papers were published in 2003, rising to 477 by 2012. Nearly 100 randomized controlled trials had been published by early 2014. =Neurological studies= Research studies have also focused on the effects of mindfulness on the brain using neuroimaging techniques, physiological measures and behavioral tests. Research on the neural perspective of how mindfulness meditation works suggests that it exerts its effects in components of attention regulation, body awareness and emotional regulation. When considering aspects such as sense of responsibility, authenticity, compassion, self-acceptance and character, studies have shown that mindfulness meditation contributes to a more coherent and healthy sense of self and identity. Neuroimaging techniques suggest that mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditation are associated with ‚Äúchanges in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporo-parietal junction, fronto-limbic network and default mode network structures.\\" Further, mindfulness meditation may prevent or delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, mindfulness-induced emotional and behavioral changes have been found to be related to functional and structural changes in the brain. It has also been suggested that the default mode network of the brain can be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring the therapeutic benefits of meditation. Recent research also suggest that the practice of mindfulness could influence genetic expression leading to a reduced risk of inflammation-related diseases and favourable changes in biomarkers. Grey matter concentrations in brain regions that regulate emotion, self-referential processing, learning and memory processes have shown changes in density following MBSR. Additionally, MBSR practice has been associated with improvement of the immune system which could explain the correlation between stress reduction and increased quality of life. Part of these changes are a result of the thickening of the prefrontal cortex (executive functioning) and hippocampus (learning and memorisation ability), the shrinking of the amygdala (emotion and stress response) and the strengthening of the connections between brain cells. Long-term meditators have larger amounts of gyrification (‚Äúfolding‚Äù of the cortex, which may allow the brain to process information faster) than people who do not meditate. Further, a direct correlation was found between the amount of gyrification and the number of meditation years, possibly providing further proof of the brain's neuroplasticity, or ability to adapt to environmental changes. =Associations of mindfulness with other variables= Mindfulness (as a trait, distinguished from mindfulness practice) has been linked to many outcomes. In an overview, Keng, Smoski, and Robins summarize: ‚ÄúTrait mindfulness has been associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, agreeableness, conscientiousness, vitality, self esteem, empathy, sense of autonomy, competence, optimism, and pleasant affect. Studies have also demonstrated significant negative correlations between mindfulness and depression, neuroticism, absentmindedness, dissociation, rumination, cognitive reactivity, social anxiety, difficulties in emotion regulation, experiential avoidance, alexithymia, intensity of delusional experience in the context of psychosis, and general psychological symptoms.‚Äù (References to underlying studies omitted from quotation.) =Effects on mindfulness= The mechanisms that make people less or more mindful have been researched less than the effects of mindfulness programmes, so we do not know much about what are the relevant components of mindfulness practice. For example, meta-analyses have shown that mindfulness practice does increase mindfulness when compared to active control groups,. This may be because we do not know how to measure mindfulness. It could also be that mindfulness is dose-dependent and increases with more experience ,. To counter that, Bergomi et al. found that ‚Äúresults provide evidence for the associations between self-reported mindfulness and meditation practice and suggest that mindfulness is particularly associated with continued practice in the present, rather than with accumulated practice over years.‚Äù Some research into other mechanisms has been done. One study conceptualised such mechanisms in terms of competition for attention. In a test of that framework, mindfulness was found to be associated (as predicted) with having an activated intention to be mindful, with feeling good, and with not being hurried or very busy. Regarding the relationship between feeling good and being mindful, a different study found that causality probably works both ways: feeling good increases mindfulness, and mindfulness increases feeling good. Concerns and criticism =Scholarly research= Many of the above cited review studies however also indicate the necessity for more high- quality research in this field such as conducting intervention studies using larger sample sizes, the use of more randomized controlled studies and the need for providing more methodological details in reported studies. The majority of studies also either measure mindfulness as a trait, and in research that use mindfulness interventions in clinical practice, the lack of true randomisation poses a problem for understanding the true effectiveness of mindfulness. Experimental methods using randomised samples, though, suggest that mindfulness as a state or temporary practice can influence felt emotions such as disgust and promote abstract decision-making. There are also a few review studies that have found little difference between mindfulness interventions and control groups, though they did also indicate that their intervention group was treated too shortly for the research to be conclusive. In some domains, like sport, no examinations of mindfulness meet gold-standard criteria for determining a causal effect. These studies also list the need for more robust research investigations. Several issues pertaining to the assessment of mindfulness have also been identified including the current use of self-report questionnaires. Potential for bias also exists to the extent that researchers in the field are also practitioners and possibly subject to pressures to publish positive or significant results. Various scholars have criticized how mindfulness has been defined or represented in recent western psychology publications. These modern understandings depart significantly from the accounts of mindfulness in early Buddhist texts and authoritative commentaries in the Theravada and Indian Mahayana traditions. Adam Valerio has introduced the idea that conflict between academic disciplines over how mindfulness is defined, understood, and popularly presented may be indicative of a personal, institutional, or paradigmatic battle for ownership over mindfulness, one where academics, researchers, and other writers are invested as individuals in much the same way as religious communities. =Shortcomings= The popularization of mindfulness as a \\"commodity\\" has been criticized, being termed \\"McMindfulness\\" by some critics. According to Safran, the popularity of mindfulness is the result of a marketing strategy: \\"McMindfulness is the marketing of a constructed dream; an idealized lifestyle; an identity makeover.\\"Safran, Jeremy D., PhD. \\"McMindfulness.\\" Psychology Today. n.p., 13 June 2014. Web. 2 April 2015. . According to Purser and Loy, mindfulness is not being used as a means to awaken to insight in the \\"unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion,\\" but reshaped into a \\"banal, therapeutic, self-help technique\\" that has the opposite effect of reinforcing those passions. While mindfulness is marketed as a means to reduce stress, in a Buddhist context it is part of an all-embracing ethical program to foster \\"wise action, social harmony, and compassion.\\" The privatization of mindfulness neglects the societal and organizational causes of stress and discomfort, instead propagating adaptation to these circumstances. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, \\"[A]bsent a sharp social critique, Buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of consumer capitalism.\\" The popularity of this new brand of mindfulness has resulted in the commercialization of meditation through self- help books, guided meditation classes, and mindfulness retreats. Buddhist commentators have criticized the movement as being presented as equivalent to Buddhist practice, while in reality it is very possibly denatured with undesirable consequences, such as being ungrounded in the traditional reflective morality and therefore, astray from traditional Buddhist ethics. Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. The conflict is often presented in concern to the teacher's credentials and qualifications, rather than the student's actual practice. Reformed Buddhist-influenced practices are being standardized and manualized in a clearly distinct separation from Buddhism seen as a religion based in monastic temples, as expressed as mindfulness in a new psychology ethic practiced in modern meditation centers. =Risks= In media reports, people have attributed unexpected effects of increasing fear and anxiety, panic or \\"meltdowns\\" after practicing, which they suggest could expose bipolar vulnerability or repressed PTSD symptoms. However, according to published peer-reviewed academic articles, these negative effects of meditation are rare for mindfulness meditation, and appear to happen due to a poor understanding of what actually constitutes mindfulness/meditation practices.

The term dysfunctional uterine bleeding was used when no underlying cause was present. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is excluded. Iron deficiency anemia may occur and quality of life may be negatively affected. The underlying causes may include ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer. More than one category of causes may apply in an individual case. The first step in work-up is to rule out a tumor or pregnancy. Medical imaging or hysteroscopy may help with the diagnosis. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Options may include hormonal birth control, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, tranexamic acid, NSAIDs, and surgery such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy. AUB affects about 20% of reproductive aged women. Signs and symptoms Symptoms include vaginal bleeding that occurs irregularly, at abnormal frequency, lasts excessively long, or is more than normal. Normal frequency of periods is 22 to 38 days. Variation in the length of time between cycles is typically less than 21 days. Bleeding typically last less than nine days and blood loss is less than 80 mL. Excessive blood loss may also be defined as that which negatively affects a person's quality of life. Bleeding more than six month after menopause is also a concern. Causes The causes of AUB are divided into nine groups: uterine polyps, fibroids, adenomyosis, cancer, blood clotting disorders, problems with ovulation, endometrial problems, healthcare induced, and not yet classified. More than one category of causes may apply in an individual case. Healthcare induced causes may include side effects of birth control. Mechanism The underlying mechanism is often a hormonal disturbance: reduced levels of progesterone cause high levels of prostaglandin F2-alpha and cause abnormally heavy flow as progesterone stabilizes the endometrium and inhibits synthesis of prostaglandin F2-alpha; increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), a fibrinolytic enzyme, lead to more fibrinolysis. = Ovulatory = Ten percent of cases occur in women who are ovulating, but progesterone secretion is prolonged because estrogen levels are low. This causes irregular shedding of the uterine lining and break-through bleeding. Some evidence has associated ovulatory DUB with more fragile blood vessels in the uterus.It may represent a possible endocrine dysfunction, resulting in menorrhagia or metrorrhagia. Mid-cycle bleeding may indicate a transient estrogen decline, while late-cycle bleeding may indicate progesterone deficiency. = Anovulatory = About 90% of DUB events occur when ovulation is not occurring (anovulatory DUB). Anovulatory menstrual cycles are common at the extremes of reproductive age, such as early puberty and perimenopause (period around menopause). In such cases, women do not properly develop and release a mature egg. When this happens, the corpus luteum, which is a mound of tissue that produces progesterone, does not form. As a result, estrogen is produced continuously, causing an overgrowth of the uterus lining. The period is delayed in such cases, and when it occurs menstruation can be very heavy and prolonged. Sometimes anovulatory DUB is due to a delay in the full maturation of the reproductive system in teenagers. Usually, however, the mechanisms are unknown. The cause can be psychological stress, weight (obesity, anorexia, or a rapid change), exercise, endocrinopathy, neoplasm, drugs, or it may be otherwise unknown. Diagnosis Diagnosis of AUB starts with a medical history and physical examination. This involves specific questions about the menstrual bleeding pattern (including the amount and the presence of pain), family history of AUB and if the person is taking medication that might affect bleeding, such as ginseng, ginkgo, motherwort, contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and warfarin or heparin derivatives. Testing the hemoglobin level and doing a pelvic ultrasound is often done. Ultrasound is specifically recommended in those over the age of 35 or those in whom bleeding continues despite initial treatment. Laboratory assessment of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), pregnancy, and chlamydia is also recommended. More extensive testing might include an MRI and endometrial sampling. Endometrial sampling is recommended in those over the age of 45 who do not improve with treatment and in those with intermenstrual bleeding that persists.The PALM-COEIN system may be used to classify the uterine bleeding.  Management  Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Options may include hormonal birth control, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, tranexamic acid, NSAIDs, and surgery such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy. Polyps, adenomyosis, and cancer are generally treated by surgery. Iron supplementation may be needed. Terminology The terminology \\"dysfunctional uterine bleeding\\" is no longer recommended. Historically dysfunctional uterine bleeding meant there was no structural or systemic problems present. In AUB underlying causes may be present. Epidemiology AUB is a common condition as it affects more than 70% of all gynecologic consults.

It was first introduced to the McDonald's menu in 1981, following test marketing the year before. After poor sales, it was removed from the menu in 1985. McRib was reintroduced in 1989, staying on the menu until 2005 in many countries. From 2006 until 2019https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2019/10/03/how-to-find- mcdonalds-mcrib-2019/3856789002/, it has generally been made available for a short time each year in most markets where it is sold, typically during the fall season, although is a permanent menu item at McDonald's restaurants in Germany and Luxembourg. Product description McRib consists of a restructured boneless pork patty shaped like a miniature rack of ribs, barbecue sauce, onions, and pickles served on a roll. The process of restructuring the meat was first developed by the US Army as a means to deliver low cost meat products to troops in the field. This process was further refined by a Natick Center contractor and meat scientist, Dr. Roger Mandigo, leading to the McRib patty. Despite its name, it is primarily composed of pork shoulder meat, according to McDonald's. McRib Jr. was available briefly in 2000. This version replaced the roll with a standard hamburger bun, and was served with two pickles and a smaller pork patty.Ryan, Andrew (November 14, 2013). \\"Alleged Canadian photo of frozen McDonald‚Äôs McRib not the most appetizing thing in the world\\". The Globe and Mail. History =1985‚Äì2004= McRib made its debut in the United States in 1981, as a limited time item. It was developed by McDonald's first Executive Chef Ren√© Arend, a native from Luxembourg, who invented Chicken McNuggets in 1979. \\"The McNuggets were so well received that every franchise wanted them,\\" said Arend in a 2009 interview. \\"There wasn‚Äôt a system to supply enough chicken. We had to come up with something to give the other franchises as a new product. So the McRib came about because of the shortage of chickens.\\" It was his inspiration to shape the McRib patty \\"like a slab of ribs,\\" despite the fact that a round patty would have been cheaper to manufacture and serve on standard hamburger buns. A packet of McRib Hot Sauce was also available when the sandwich was first being sold. The sauce was a clear liquid in a semi- chrome packet the size of a standard ketchup packet. McRib was not immediately successful. It test-marketed very well in the Midwest, and was added to the restaurant's permanent menu for the United States in 1981. Sales were mediocre, however, and it was removed in 1985 as McDonald's executives determined that pork is not eaten frequently enough in the United States to stay on the menu. After several years, it returned for a promotion. It is more popular in Germany and Luxembourg, where it remains a permanent item. McRib was also brought back occasionally in 1989, 1990 (together with the \\"BBQ in a Bag\\" promotion), 1991, 1992 (with the Western Omelette McMuffin as part of a Western promotion), and 1993. In summer 1994, McDonald's brought back McRib nationally, as a tie in with the theatrical release of The Flintstones, comparing the appearance of it with the rack of ribs that topples the Flintmobile in both the animated and live action productions. McDonald's (which was featured in the film as \\"RocDonald's\\") supported the return with McRib packaging featuring the Flintstones characters and a television commercial featuring Rosie O'Donnell in her role as Betty Rubble. After that promotion, the McRib was also sold as part of various limited time regional offerings at selected restaurants in the US and Canada from 1995 until 2004. =2005‚Äìpresent= On November 1, 2005, McDonald's issued a press release announcing that McRib would be permanently removed from the menu following a \\"McRib Farewell Tour\\". McRib.com, a website registered to McDonald's, featured a petition to \\"Save the McRib\\", which was facetiously sponsored by the \\"Boneless Pig Farmers Association of America\\". On October 16, 2006, the \\"McRib Farewell Tour II\\" site appeared. McRib reappeared in the United States in October 2007, beginning a third \\"farewell tour\\". McDonald's sold 30 million made with over 7 million pounds (3 million kg) of pork in 2007. Its fourth reintroduction was in the end of October 2008, across the United States, Hong Kong, and Japan, with a promotional website featuring music sponsored by a \\"McRib DJ Plowman\\" in tribute to its creator. Additional limited time regional offerings, in various regions of the United States as well as in Canada, were made throughout 2008 and 2009. On November 2, 2010, McDonald's began six weeks of nationwide McRib availability at the Legends of the McRib event in New York City, honoring three superfans: Joey Erwin, aka Mr. McRib; Alan Klein, founder of the McRib Locator website; and Adam Winer. The promotion ended December 5, 2010. McDonald's credited it with boosting their November 2010 sales by 4.8%. It was the first national offering of the McRib since 1994. McRib was offered in Canada from June 21 to August 1, 2011. On October 24, 2011, McDonald's once again made the McRib available for three weeks in a promotion ending November 14. In celebration of the London Olympics 2012, McDonald's Australia and New Zealand reintroduced McRib as the Atlanta Pork McRib. McRib was one of six limited edition McDonald's items named after previous host cities. It was released on Wednesday 23 May and ran until June 5. Sales of McRib in New Zealand exceeded expectations, exhausting supplies within days of the release of the burger with restaurants running out of their allocations of stock. For 2012, McDonald's announced that McRib's annual release would be delayed until the December 17, as opposed to its traditional autumn release (which would instead be used to debut the Cheddar Bacon Onion Angus Burger, or \\"CBO\\"). The move was an effort to boost sales during the December period in an attempt to match 2011's abnormally high restaurant wide sales figures.Morrison, Maureen (September 17, 2012). Can the McRib save Christmas?. Advertising Age. Retrieved September 19, 2012. McRib wasn't released nationally and was sold only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (a la the 2005 \\"McRib Farewell Tour\\" promotion) in 2013 due to the company introducing several new products (such as the Mighty Wings). McRib was sold again starting on October 20, 2014 and ending on January 4, 2015, but only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (a la the 2006 \\"McRib Farewell Tour II\\" promotion). McRib made a return in the United Kingdom on December 31, 2014 until February 3, 2015. McRib was sold again starting on October 2015 and ending in January 2016, but only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (55 percent of McDonald's locations). It became available again in November 2016, but at a limited number of McDonald's locations; and once more since October 2017, but in most areas. Local McDonalds Twitter accounts announced in Southern California and Hawaii that the McRib would be returning to these locations on 2 and 9 November 2017 respectively. The McRib once again made a limited return in the United States and Australia at participating locations starting in October 2018. HSUS lawsuit In November 2011, the Humane Society of the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against the producer of McRib meat, Smithfield Foods, alleging cruel and unusual treatment of the animals used in the McRib patty production. The complaint cites the use of gestation crates and poor and unsanitary living conditions, as well as a lack of proper animal welfare. Limited availability Speculation on the limited availability of the McRib includes theories concerning the fluctuating price and unreliable supply chains of bulk pork, manipulation of availability windows to turn the product into a better loss leader for the company, and the generation of renewed enthusiasm and higher sales as a result of scarcity. An informal study from 2011 entitled \\"A Conspiracy of Hogs: The McRib as Arbitrage\\" illustrates a correlation between the price of pork and the timing of McDonald's offering the sandwich; all five of the US McRib offerings between 2005 and 2011 occurred during low points in the price of bulk pork. According to McDonald's, the sandwich's limited availability is due to their desire to provide a varied menu throughout the year.Why isn't the McRib sold year-round?. Retrieved November 06, 2014.

He was distinguished by his knowledge, intellect, sense of humor and conversational skills, and although his style has been criticized as wordy and obtuse, he was one of the more popular Japanese writers in the late Sh≈çwa period. Early life Kaik≈ç was born in the Tennoji Ward of Osaka as the son of an elementary school teacher. In 1948, he enrolled in the Law Department of Osaka City University, but was often absent from class, as he had to take a variety of part-time jobs in order to pay for his tuition. While in school, rather than study law he was sidetracked by the works of Motojir≈ç Kajii, Mitsuharu Kaneko and Atsushi Nakajima. He also translated the works of Sherwood Anderson and Louis Aragon into Japanese. He graduated in 1953 and moved to Tokyo, where he took a job with Kotobukiya (the present Suntory), where he worked in the public-relations department. He married Y≈çko Maki, a poet. Literary career Kaik≈ç published his first work, Na no nai machi (Nameless City, 1953) in the literary magazine Kindai Bungaku soon after his move to Tokyo. It was largely ignored by critics. However, his second work, a short story titled Panniku (Panic, 1957) published in the Shin Nippon Bunkaku, caused a sensation for its unusual concept and style. It was a story about a dedicated forester in a rural prefecture of Japan, who struggles against government incompetence and corruption. Kaik≈ç wrote the story as a satirical allegory comparing human beings to mice. Kaik≈ç won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 1957 with his Hadaka no ≈çsama (The Naked King), a story critical of the pressures placed on school children by Japan's educational system. Kaik≈ç is considered a leftist activist, respected in many Indochinese countries, in particular, for his vocal opposition to Japan's support of the United States' policies in Indochina in the 1960s. He was one of the founders of the Beheiren (Betonamu ni heiwa o! Shimin rengo), or the League for Peace in Vietnam. This activity was related to his experience as a war correspondent in Vietnam with the Asahi Shimbun; he was briefly imprisoned by the Viet Cong. These experiences translated into his novel, Kagayakeru yami (Into a Black Sun, 1968), an account of a Japanese journalist experiencing first-hand the life of the Americans and South Vietnamese troops in Vietnam. The novel won the prestigious Mainichi Book Award. However, Kaik≈ç had a wide range of topics in his repertory. Natsu no yami (Darkness in Summer, 1971) was essentially a romance between a reporter and an expatriate Japanese woman living in Europe. Kaik≈ç enriched the Japanese language with the word \\"apache\\", to denote scavengers of recyclables, described in his novel, Japan's Threepenny Opera.

He was born in the rectory of Glendoen, near Letterkenny, Donegal, Ireland, of which parish his maternal grandfather, Joseph Stopford, was then rector. He was the eldest son of the Rev. Richard Sinclair Brooke, later incumbent of the Mariners' church, Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire), and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He was ordained in the Church of England in 1857, and held various charges in London. From 1863 to 1865 he was chaplain to the Empress Frederick in Berlin. In 1869 with his brother Edward he made long tours of Donegal and Sligo, and spent much time at Kells studying Irish antiquities. Between 1866 and 1875 he was the minister at St James's Chapel, a Proprietary Chapel, and after it closed he took services at Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury where he continued to attract large congregations. In 1875, he became chaplain in ordinary to Queen Victoria. But in 1880 he seceded from the Church, being no longer able to accept its leading dogmas, and officiated as an independent preacher for some years at Bedford chapel, Bloomsbury. Bedford chapel was pulled down about 1894, and from that time he had no church of his own, but his eloquence and powerful religious personality continued to make themselves felt among a wide circle. A man of independent means, he was always keenly interested in literature and art, and a fine critic of both. The two-volume Life and Letters of Stopford Brooke, written by his son-in-law L. P. Jacks and published in 1917, contains many details of different facets of his life. In 1890-1 he took the lead in raising the funds to purchase Dove Cottage, William Wordsworth's home in Grasmere from 1800 to 1808, and establishing it ‚Äúfor the eternal possession of those who love English poetry all over the world\\". Dove Cottage is now administered by the Wordsworth Trust. Brooke published in 1865 his Life and Letters of FW Robertson (of Brighton), and in 1876 wrote an admirable primer of English Literature (new and revised ed., 1900‚Äîbut see below), followed in 1892 by The History of Early English Literature (2 vols, 1892) down to the accession of Alfred the Great, and English Literature from the Beginnings to the Norman Conquest (1898).From the Contents page of the 1910 reprint of \\"English Literature\\": Third Edition 1896.

They had six daughters, the eldest of whom was the social reformer Honor Brooke, and two sons, including Stopford Brooke, a Member of Parliament from 1906 to 1910. Brooke's second daughter Maud married T. W. Rolleston, the Irish writer; his fourth daughter Olive married L. P. Jacks, philosopher, Unitarian minister and Principal of Manchester College, Oxford; and his fifth daughter Sybil married L. Leslie Brooke, the artist of children's books: their son Henry was to become Home Secretary.

History Dolmen in Emmen Grote of Pancratiuskerk A prime example of a planned city, Emmen arose from several small farming and peat-harvesting communities which have dotted the province of Drenthe since the Middle Ages. Traces of these communities can still be seen in the form of the villages of Westenesch, Noordbarge and Zuidbarge: they have a separate history and layout, but are surrounded by the suburbs and the centre of Emmen. The expansion of the town did not happen until after the Second World War. Suburbs were built around the old centre of Emmen, starting with Emmermeer directly to the north, and followed to the south-east by Angelslo (for which an old village of the same name was demolished), Emmerhout (famed at the time for being separated from the town by an existing forest) to the east, Bargeres, the Rietlanden and Parc Sandur to the south and south-west. Construction of the last suburb, called Delftlanden, is well underway with a large number of homes already built and people living in the area. There are few historic landmarks left within the town, but those few include the church on the market square, where a church has been standing since the Middle Ages, the court of law building, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century, and the post office from the same time. In the town's environs an earthwork by Robert Smithson, \\"Broken Circle/Spiral Hill\\", may be found. In 1957 it hosted the 1st Women's Chess Olympiad. The prime economic booster since the 1980s has been the zoo, the Dierenpark Emmen. Begun in the 1930s, it was almost completely redesigned in the 1970s, and is now co-owned by the municipality of Emmen. It attracts over 1.5 million visitors per year. It was replaced by Wildlands in 2016, when the old zoo closed. Important industries include Teijin Aramid, DSM Engineering Plastics, Wellman and Diolen Industrial Fibers. There are extensive glasshouse complexes for horticulture, especially in the Klazienaveen-Erica area. The municipality offers some 38,000 jobs. Emmen is the most populous urban area of Drenthe. The municipality of Emmen is one of the largest in the Netherlands, although the area outside the town borders of Emmen is rather rural. The other villages of importance are Emmer-Compascuum, Klazienaveen, Nieuw-Amsterdam and Schoonebeek.  Geography  Dutch Topographic map of Emmen (town), March 2014 The population centres: * Barger- Compascuum * Emmen * Emmer-Compascuum * Erica * Klazienaveen * Nieuw-Amsterdam * Nieuw-Dordrecht * Nieuw-Schoonebeek * Nieuw-Weerdinge * Roswinkel * Schoonebeek * Veenoord * Weiteveen * Zwartemeer  Demography  The municipality of Emmen has some 107,000 inhabitants, with 56,000 living in the city of Emmen. Compared to some 3,000 inhabitants in the nineteenth century, this illustrates the rapid growth of Emmen in the past 150 years. Sport The town's football club FC Emmen plays their home games in De Oude Meerdijk. They play in the Eredivisie. Every year a big cycle racing criterium called Gouden Pijl, where all the big names in bicycle sport come to Emmen for this event. Besides the bicycle race itself the Gouden Pijl also includes cultural events like pop-concerts etc. In 2008 the comeback concert of The Schizo's, the infamous local punk-band from the 1980s, was organised during the Gouden Pijl.

Transportation  Emmen is served by one train connection with Zwolle, which in turn leads to the rest of the country. *Emmen railway station *Emmen Zuid railway stationhttp://www.stationsweb.nl/station.asp?station=emmenzuid *Nieuw Amsterdam railway station In addition, there are regular and frequent bus lines within Emmen and towards Groningen, Hoogeveen and Assen, as well as the surrounding countryside, and Meppen in Germany, departing from Emmen's two bus terminals. By car, the town is accessible via the N34 from Ommen via Hardenberg and Coevorden towards Emmen, ending at the A28 motorway (Netherlands) towards Groningen near de Punt, the N381 to Drachten, the N391 to Veendam which goes through Emmen (with access to almost every district) and the A37 from Hoogeveen to Meppen in Germany, although this motorway is not directly next to Emmen. From the A37 to Emmen there are three possibilities: at Junction Holsloot (A37 x N34), at Highway-exit Schoonebeek (A37 x N853), and Highway-exit Klazienaveen (A37 x N862). The A37 is also the quickest way towards the Randstad from Emmen. The A37 ends at the German border, where it continues as the B402 or European route E233. The nearest airport is Groningen Airport Eelde at a distance of 50 kilometers. Furthermore, there are inland shipping connections via Nieuw-Amsterdam to Coevorden, Hoogeveen and Almelo.

He was elected in 1997 as the first African American Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, serving two terms. He was known for his achievements in gaining reinvestment in the city to revitalize downtown. He ran again in 2009 and was elected. When he ran for what would have been his fourth term, he was defeated in the Democratic primary in July 2013 by challengers Chokwe Lumumba, who was elected as mayor, and Jonathan Lee. Biography Harvey Johnson Jr. was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and attended the Vicksburg public schools, graduating from Rosa A. Temple High School. He received a bachelor's degree in political science from Tennessee State University and a master's degree in political science from the University of Cincinnati. His professional career includes the founding of the Mississippi Institute of Small Towns, a non- profit agency developed to assist small economically depressed towns with minority leadership with housing, community development and infrastructure needs. In 1990 Governor Ray Mabus appointed the subject to a six-year term on the state tax commission, which included the oversight of the newly established gaming industry.Mayer, Gregg (15 February 2001). \\"Johnson to seek second term as Mayor\\". Clarion Ledger (Jackson). In 1993, Johnson ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Jackson, placing third in the Democratic primary behind two white candidates, incumbent mayor J. Kane Ditto and former mayor Dale Danks. But in 1997, Johnson defeated Ditto in the Democratic primary, and later defeated Republican opponent Charlotte Reeves in the general election, becoming Jackson's first African-American mayor. Supporters credited Johnson with overseeing a dramatic renaissance in the city, leading the charge for several projects to help revive a decaying downtown area, including the revitalization of the Farish Street Neighborhood Historic District and passage of a controversial bond issue to build a convention center. Critics charged that he was an unresponsive leader who was not appropriately concerned with the city's large crime problem, neglected the maintenance of streets, and did little to curb the exodus of Jackson's upper- and middle-class residents to places outside the city limits. During his reelection bid in 2001, Johnson faced off against Republican challenger, C. Daryl Neely, a city councilman. It was the first time in the city's history that two African-American mayoral candidates faced each other in the general election. Johnson soundly defeated Neely with 61% of the vote. In 2005, Johnson was challenged in the Democratic primary by Frank Melton, a controversial TV station manager; the challenger promised to solve the city's crime problem in 90 days while giving few specific crime plans, making crime the central focus of the election. Critics charged that Johnson said crime was only a \\"perception.\\" But he had complained about the \\"perception of hopelessness\\" which he said the media's focus on crime engendered. The phrase \\"perception of crime,\\" while inaccurate, was used widely by opponents and critics of the incumbent mayor. Melton defeated the incumbent by 63 percent of the vote in the Democratic Primary. Melton easily defeated Republican challenger Rick Whitlow in the general election and succeeded Johnson as mayor of Jackson. Johnson is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is an alum of National Urban Fellows, class of 1976. Johnson is also a deacon at the Hope Springs Missionary Baptist Church of Jackson, Mississippi. In early 2009, Johnson again ran for Mayor of Jackson. On Tuesday, May 5, 2009, he led a crowded field of ten candidates in the Democratic primary. Gaining 28% of the vote, Johnson was forced into a runoff with City Councilman Marshand Crisler, who had finished a close second with 27% of the vote. In the runoff two weeks later, Johnson defeated Crisler, winning in five of the seven wards, despite being outspent four to one. In a majority-black city that votes heavily Democratic, Johnson handily defeated Republican challenger George Lambus and four independent candidates in the June 2nd general election. Johnson's election has made him become the city's first three-term mayor since Dale Danks. Running for re-election in the Democratic primary on May 7, 2013, the veteran mayor was defeated by Chokwe Lumumba, Ward Two Councilman, and Jonathan Lee, former Chamber of Commerce president, in every city ward.Eason, Brian (May 9, 2013) \\"Race no longer clear-cut issue in Jackson mayoral politics\\", Clarion Ledger.

He later served in the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. Schooling and War of 1812 Josiah was the son of Josiah Tattnall, who was Governor and U.S. Senator from Georgia. He was born on his father's Bonaventure Plantation, near Savannah, Georgia. After studying in England, he was appointed a midshipman on January 1, 1812, and attended the Naval academy at Washington, D.C., until 1 August when he was assigned to the frigate Constellation. When his ship tried to slip out to sea, the strong British squadron operating in the Chesapeake Bay forced her to put into Norfolk, Virginia. Constellation remained bottled up in Hampton Roads for the duration of the War of 1812, but Tattnall and his comrades still managed to get into the fray. He was among the 100 or so sailors and marines assigned to the shore battery on Craney Island. On June 22, 1813, the British attempted to carry the island by storm in preparation for an attack on nearby Norfolk. Tattnall's battery and a force of American boats gave the attackers a sound rebuff that deterred the British from further attempts to take the city. In April 1814, Midshipman Tattnall was detached from Constellation and, by August 24, was in command of a force of employees from the Washington Navy Yard. He led them into the Battle of Bladensburg in an unsuccessful effort to stop the British advance on the American capital. On October 14, he was ordered to Savannah for duty on Epervier. In May 1815, that sloop sailed for the Mediterranean with Commodore Stephen Decatur's squadron to engage the Barbary Pirates in Algiers in the Second Barbary War. On June 17, she participated in the capture of the frigate Mashouda and, two days later, of the brig Estedio. In July, when Epervier was ordered back to the United States with dispatches, Tattnall remained in the Mediterranean in Constellation. In January 1817, he transferred to Ontario and returned in her to the United States. Interwar years, 1818‚Äì1845 Promoted to lieutenant on April 1, 1818, Tattnall was assigned to the frigate Macedonian on June 30, and he sailed in her for the Pacific in November. He was detached from Macedonian on August 30, 1820, and returned to the United States. Ordered to Norfolk on December 26, 1822, he joined Commodore David Porter's squadron in schooner Jackall. Lieutenant Tattnall served in the West Indies on an expedition to suppress piracy until he was detached on May 4, 1823. On June 23, 1824, Tattnall was ordered to Constitution for Mediterranean service. In March 1826, he transferred to Brandywine and returned home in her in May. On the 15th of that month, he was granted six months leave, which was later extended into 1828. Tattnall served in Erie from October 1828 to August 1829 and then went on to survey the Tortugas until March 1830. Lt. Tattnall took command of schooner Grampus on April 15, 1831, and cruised the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico. In August 1832, he captured the Mexican schooner, Montezuma, which had boarded and robbed an American ship on the high seas. He was detached from Grampus in September 1832 and went on leave awaiting orders for almost four years before being ordered in, July 1836, to recruit men for Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones' survey and exploration expedition. Tattnall was promoted to commander on February 25, 1836, and, in April, reported for a three-year tour of duty at the Boston Navy Yard. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Following service with the Mediterranean and African squadrons, Commander Tattnall joined the Mosquito Division in the Gulf of Mexico in 1846, commanding the steam gunboat, Spitfire. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he took part in the attacks on Vera Cruz, San Juan d'Ulloa, and Tuxpan, and he suffered an arm wound. For his gallantry before Vera Cruz, the state of Georgia presented him with a sword. Interwar years, 1848‚Äì1860 Portrait showing him in pre-Civil War uniform. In 1848 and 1849, he returned to shore duty at the Boston Navy Yard. On February 5, 1850, he was commissioned captain and, the following month, was given command of Saranac. Next, he commanded the Pensacola Navy Yard from July 1851 to June 1854. From August 1854 to November 1855, Captain Tattnall was flag captain in Independence to Commodore William Mervine with the Pacific Squadron. At Hong Kong on January 29, 1858, he relieved Commodore James Armstrong taking command of the East India Squadron, breaking his flag in San Jacinto. During his two years in the Far East, Commodore Tattnall violated American neutrality while commanding the chartered steamer Toey-Wan, when he came to the assistance of a British and French squadron under fire from the Taku Forts at the mouth of the Pei Ho or Hai River. His explanation of his action, \\"blood is thicker than water\\", subsequently became a famous slogan. On his return voyage early in 1860, Tattnall commanded the Powhatan, carrying the first diplomatic embassy from Tokugawa Japan to the United States. While stopped at Honolulu, Hawaii along the way, the British residents of that city wrote a letter thanking Tattnall for his \\"gallant and humane conduct\\" during the \\"unfortunate affair at the Pei-ho River\\". The embassy was safely conveyed to San Francisco and then Panama, where they crossed the isthmus and continued on to Washington, D.C. American Civil War Captain Franklin Buchanan & Captain Josiah Tattnall At the outbreak of the Civil War, Capt. Tattnall held command of the Sackett's Harbor Station. Though he opposed secession, Tattnall resigned his commission on February 21, 1861. A week later, Governor Joseph E. Brown commissioned Tattnall as the senior flag officer of the Navy of Georgia. On March 26, 1861, he received his commission as a captain in the Confederate Navy. Tattnall commanded Southern naval units during the defense of Port Royal until the harbor was captured by Union forces on 7 November 1861. From there, he moved to overall command of the defense of Virginia's waters early in March 1862. Tattnall, by then a flag officer in the Confederate Navy as well as the Navy of Georgia, directed CSS Jamestown and other warships in captures of Federal merchantmen off Sewell's Point in April 1862. On May 11, 1862, in the face of advancing Federal forces, Flag Officer Tattnall ordered the destruction of his flagship, CSS Virginia (ex-Merrimack). He was later acquitted by a court martial of all charges stemming from that action. He resumed command of the naval forces of Georgia on May 29, 1862, and retained it until 31 March 1863, when he turned over command of forces afloat to Comdr. Richard L. Page and concentrated upon the shore defenses of Savannah. When Savannah fell to General William Tecumseh Sherman's troops, Tattnall became a prisoner of war. He was paroled on May 9, 1865, and, soon thereafter, took up residence once more in Savannah. Death Tattnall died in Savannah on June 14, 1871, and was buried in Bonaventure Cemetery.

It is divided into several sections like IPCA-Europe, IPCA Oceania etc. It is a non-governmental organization and has held Special Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 2014. IPCA Europe IPCA-Europe, the European section of the global IPCA organization (founded 1985 in Bossey, Switzerland), commenced its work with the Ecumenical Conference for Pastoral Counselling in European Prisons, held in Strasbourg in May 1992. The conference was conducted in collaboration with the Council of Europe. The working goal (now partially achieved) is to create a network between prison chaplains of all Christian churches in Europe. The network is intended to facilitate ecumenical cooperation and mutual support. The chief aims are: maintenance of human rights and freedom of religious practice and pastoral counseling in prisons, protection of minorities and improvement of the situation of crime victims. At regular intervals, currently every four years, IPCA-Europe organizes a pan-European conference chiefly aimed at active prison chaplains. Following the 1992 event, further conferences took place in Rugby, England in 1994, in Ystad, Sweden in 1997 and in Driebergen, the Netherlands in 2001. Each conference was attended by more than 100 participants from some 30 European countries. Between the pan- European conferences IPCA-Europe also initiates working groups and regional conferences in collaboration with regional and national associations of prison chaplains. IPCA-Europe is an associate organization of the CEC (Conference of European Churches) and is in contact with the Committee for the Prevention of Torture of the Council of Europe. During the pan-European conferences a steering committee is elected to prepare the next conference and to conduct business. The steering committee is itself responsible for funding its work. It elects a chairman and, generally speaking, meets twice a year. The steering committee currently comprises eight elected members and one co-opted member from various European regions and churches. IPCA-Europe does not have a secure budget at its disposal. The work is funded through project-based ecclesiastical and state grants.

Service in Africa and during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Badger received an appointment as a midshipman in the United States Navy on 9 September 1841 and, after a tour of duty in the , served in along the Atlantic coast of Africa. While serving in the latter ship, he saw his first action in the punitive expedition that landed on the west coast of Africa in 1843 and destroyed the Berribee villages. In the sidewheel steamer , during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he participated in the expedition that captured the Mexican town of Alvarado in the spring of 1847. Attended the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland Badger then attended the Naval School (as the Naval Academy was then called) at Annapolis, Maryland; completed his course of study there; and was warranted a passed midshipman on 10 August 1847. Posted to the Pacific Squadron By 1850, he was posted to the Pacific Squadron and served successively in the , the frigate , and the sloop . He returned to shore in 1853 for a tour of duty at the United States Naval Observatory located in Washington, D.C. In 1855, he returned to the Pacific Squadron for duty in the sloop and, that autumn, participated in an expedition to the Fiji Islands to redress wrongs suffered by members of the crews of American whalers and merchant ships at the hands of natives. The landing party destroyed the village of Vutia. To round out his pre-Civil War service, Badger was assigned in turn to the , , , and, lastly, to the Washington Navy Yard. Service in the American Civil War He was serving in the national capital at the outbreak of the Civil War, and took command of the screw steamer early in the conflict. In her, he participated in a series of actions against Confederate batteries along the Virginia bank of the Potomac River. During the Peninsula Campaign, he took part in the siege of Yorktown, Virginia. In 1862, he was transferred to the western theater to superintend the arming of river gunboats. In mid-1863, he was switched to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and participated in the attack on shore batteries on Morris Island on 11 July 1863. A week later, he commanded in an attack on Fort Wagner and, a month after that, led the ironclad in a series of operations against Forts Wagner, Gregg, and Sumter. On the night of 22 August 1863, he took command of the ironclad on another assault on Fort Sumter. =Appointed fleet captain of the South Atlantic Blockade= Soon thereafter, Badger was appointed fleet captain, ad interim, of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and, in that office, took part in another attack on Fort Sumter while in the flagship on the night of 1 September 1863. During that action, he was severely wounded in the leg by a flying metal splinter. He spent the remaining years of the Civil War ashore performing ordnance duty at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and serving as inspector of cannon at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the war, he became a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Post-Civil War service with the fleet On December 26, 1866 he took command of the newly commissioned sidewheel steamer USS ‚Äîa ship of the North Atlantic Squadron‚Äîand, in her, rendered assistance to the victims of a fire that destroyed Basseterre on St. Kitts in the Leeward Islands. The Peoria was decommissioned in September 1867. In 1868, he was assigned to equipment duty at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in New Hampshire. He returned to sea in 1871 in command of the of the South Atlantic Fleet. He commanded the receiving ship at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1873 and 1874 and served again at the Washington Navy Yard between 1875 and 1878. Final military service Badger's last sea duty came in 1878 and 1879 when he commanded the frigate . He commanded Constitution on a voyage to France to represent the United States Navy at the Paris Exposition of 1878. The voyage, beset by several mishaps, lasted from March 1878 to May 1879. During 1880, he was stationed in Washington for special duty. While serving at the Naval Asylum in Philadelphia, Badger was promoted to commodore in November 1881. After commanding the Boston Navy Yard between 1881 and 1885, Badger retired in August 1885. He died on 20 June 1899. He is buried in section 2, of Arlington National Cemetery.

A combined British-Canadian force of 6,000 finally trapped a group of approximately 5,000 Boer soldiers and some civilians, under Piet Cronj√©, in a bend of the Modder River near Kimberley, having advanced from south of the Modder River on the 11th. The Boers defended a series of trenches on Paardeberg Hill. The Imperial commander, Kitchener (temporarily replacing the unwell Roberts), began the battle by ordering a charge straight at the Boer trenches. The land sloped down to the Boer position and lacked any cover for or more. The Highland Brigade and the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry, led the attack. The Boer soldiers withheld fire until the British soldiers were within . The British were pinned and the exchange of fire continued until nightfall when the British withdrew. The Highlanders took almost 300 casualties; the Canadian losses were 18 dead and 60 wounded. Attacks elsewhere along the line resulted in a total 1,100 casualties, with two hundred killed -- the worst single day loss for the Imperial forces. After the first assault Roberts retook command that evening. With the Boers trapped he ordered the digging of trenches and a bombardment, which continued for nine days. On 27 February, after a confused night attack, the surviving Boer soldiers surrendered - around 4,000 in total. A further 2,000 Imperial soldiers died or were invalided at Paardeberg from illness, mostly due to drinking the water of the Modder River, downstream from where the Boer were throwing horse and cattle corpses killed by the artillery fire.

In a technical context, the angular range is called viewing cone defined by a multitude of viewing directions. The viewing angle can be an angular range over which the display view is acceptable, or it can be the angle of generally acceptable viewing, such as a twelve o'clock viewing angle for a display optimized or viewing from the top. The image may seem garbled, poorly saturated, of poor contrast, blurry, or too faint outside the stated viewing angle range, the exact mode of \\"failure\\" depends on the display type in question. For example, some projection screens reflect more light perpendicular to the screen and less light to the sides, making the screen appear much darker (and sometimes colors distorted) if the viewer is not in front of the screen. Many manufacturers of projection screens thus define the viewing angle as the angle at which the luminance of the image is exactly half of the maximum. With LCD screens, some manufacturers have opted to measure the contrast ratio, and report the viewing angle as the angle where the contrast ratio exceeds 5:1 or 10:1, giving minimally acceptable viewing conditions. The viewing angle is measured from one direction to the opposite, giving a maximum of 180¬∞ for a flat, one-sided screen. A display may exhibit different behaviour in horizontal and vertical axes, requiring users and manufacturers to specify maximum usable viewing angles in both directions. Usually the screens are designed to facilitate greater viewing angle in horizontal level, and smaller angle in the vertical level, should the two of them be different in magnitude. The viewing angle for some displays are specified in only a general direction, such as 6 o'clock or 12 o'clock. Early LCDs had strikingly narrow viewing cones, a situation that has been improved with current technology. Narrow viewing cones of some types of displays have also been used to bring a measure of security in businesses, where employees handle private information in the presence of customers, banks being one example. Rectangular filters fitting to the computer monitors have also been sold as accessories for this purpose.

Life in the Netherlands Holland was born in 1728 in Deventer,Samuel Holland, Canada's first Surveyor-General the Netherlands. He was baptised on 22 September 1729 in the small Lutheran Church in the Dutch town of Deventer in the Province of Overijssel. In 1745, he entered the Dutch or Staatse Leger artillery and served during the War of the Austrian Succession. He was promoted lieutenant in 1747. In 1749, Holland married Gertrude Hasse. They had one daughter who is thought to have died in infancy. In 1754, having possibly made contact with the Duke of Richmond and leaving his wife behind in the Netherlands, Holland emigrated to England to seek advancement under the British flag. Early years in British North America In 1756, Holland, probably with Richmond's aid, became a lieutenant in the Royal Americans, coming to British North America where he would spend the rest of his life. Among his first assignments was the preparation of a map of New York province; this map would be widely used for twenty years. In 1757, during the French and Indian Wars, he was promoted Captain lieutenant and assigned to reconnoitre Fort Carillon near Ticonderoga, New York, but in early 1758 he was transferred as assistant engineer to the expedition against Louisbourg. There, Holland made surveys of the surrounding area and prepared plans and gave engineering advice under the command of Brigadier-General James Wolfe. Following Louisbourg's capitulation, Holland was strongly commended by Wolfe to the Duke of Richmond. That winter, Holland and his new pupil, James Cook, drew charts of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Saint Lawrence River in preparation for an attack on Quebec. He also supervised the construction of Fort Frederick in Saint John, New Brunswick. He was promoted captain in 1759 and participated actively in the siege of Quebec, narrowly escaping death on one occasion when his boats were nearly run down by a schooner. Holland was later employed in surveying the settled parts of the Saint Lawrence River valley and in drawing up new plans for a citadel in Quebec after the French siege was lifted. Surveyor General In 1762, Holland took his maps to London where he submitted them to the Board of Trade, proposing a survey of all British possessions in North America to facilitate settlement, a proposal which was accepted in 1764. On 6 March 1764, Holland was appointed Surveyor-General of North America. On 23 March, he received instructions to survey all British possessions north of the Potomac River, which included St. John's Island, the Magdalen Islands, and Cape Breton Island, because of their importance for the fisheries. Holland arrived in October 1764 on Isle Saint-Jean, whose territory was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Paris (1763). The task of mapping the island lasted two years. Holland's survey divided the island into a series of townships known as \\"lots\\", parishes, counties, and \\"royalties\\" (shire towns) in advance of a feudal land system which was established on the island over the following century. Holland was later given a parcel of land on the St. John's Island, Lot 28, settled by farmers. Holland charged very little as an absentee landlord. In 1767 he proposed that British explorers look for a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, but his proposal was never taken into great consideration. In 1791 he became the Surveyor-General of Lower Canada and Upper Canada, then replaced with Sir David William Smith, 1st Baronet in 1792. Personal life Holland had begun living in Quebec as early as 1762 with then 21-year-old Marie-Joseph Rollet. Their first son, John Frederick, was born on St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island). Although his separation from Gertrude Hasse had been amicable, he still paid her an annual allowance between 1756 and 1780. In 1784 Hasse petitioned the British government to force him to renew payments, but she was refused. In about 1772 Holland's marriage to Marie-Joseph Rollet was contracted as legal. The couple would eventually establish a family of ten children. Samuel Holland died at Quebec, Lower Canada in 1801 and buried in a private cemetery on his Holland House estate or Holland Farm.http://www.islandregister.com/holland2.html This estate has since been re-developed.http://www.qctonline.com/history-ross- cottage Honours The community college system for Prince Edward Island, Holland College, is named for Samuel Holland, as is the community of Holland Landing, Ontario.

This coastal plain reaches from the Florida Panhandle, southwest Georgia, the southern two- thirds of Alabama, over most of Mississippi, western Tennessee and Kentucky, into southern Illinois, the Missouri Bootheel, eastern and southern Arkansas, all of Louisiana, the southeast corner of Oklahoma, and easternmost Texas in the United States. It continues along the Gulf in northeastern and eastern Mexico, through Tamaulipas and Veracruz to Tabasco and the Yucat√°n Peninsula on the Bay of Campeche. Geography The Gulf Coastal Plain's southern boundary is the Gulf of Mexico in the U.S. and the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico. On the north, it extends to the Ouachita Highlands of the Interior Low Plateaus and the southern Appalachian Mountains. Its northernmost extent is along the Mississippi embayment (Mississippi Alluvial Valley) as far north as the southern tip of Illinois. To the east the Gulf coastal plain meets the South Atlantic Coastal Plain in southern Georgia along the basin divide between the rivers flowing into the Gulf and those flowing to the AtlanticThe Geography of Georgia and south along the Apalachicola River through the Florida panhandle. The flat to rolling topography is broken by many streams, river riparian areas, and marsh wetlands. The Gulf Coastal Plain also extends into southern Mexico and up to the northern west coast states of the US. = United States section = The Gulf Coastal Plain is a westward extension of the Atlantic Coastal Plain around the Gulf of Mexico. It is only the lower, seaward part of this region that deserves the name of plain, for there alone is the surface unbroken by hills or valleys. The inner part, initially a plain, has been maturely dissected into an elaborate complex of hills and valleys, usually of increasing altitude and relief as one passes inland. The Gulf Plain features not found in the Atlantic coastal plain are: * the peninsular extension of the plain in Florida * the belted arrangement of relief and soils in Alabama and in Texas * the Mississippi embayment or inland extension of the plain half-way up the course of the Mississippi River to its junction with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois, with the Mississippi flood plain there included.  Florida peninsula  A broad, low crustal arch extends southward at the junction of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains. The emerged half of the arch, constitutes the visible lowland peninsula of Florida. The submerged half extends westward under the shallow Florida overlapping waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The northern part of the peninsula is composed largely of a weak limestone. Here, much of the lowland drainage is underground forming many sinkholes (swallowholes). Many small lakes in the lowland appear to owe their basins to the solution of the limestones. Valuable phosphate deposits occur in certain districts. The southern part of the state includes the Everglades, a large area of low, flat, marshy land, overgrown with tall reedy grass. The eastern coast is fringed by long-stretching sand reefs, enclosing lagoons so narrow and continuous that they are popularly called rivers. At the southern end of the peninsula is a series of coral islands, known as the Florida Keys. They appear to be due to the forward growth of corals and other lime-secreting organisms towards the strong current of the Gulf Stream from which they obtain their food. The western coast has fewer, shorter off-shore reefs. Much of it is of minutely irregular outline.  Alabama ‚Äì Mississippi belted plain  A typical example of a belted coastal plain is found in Alabama and the adjacent part of Mississippi. The plain is here about wide. The basal formation is chiefly a weak limestone, which has been stripped from its original Alabama innermost extension and worn down to a flat inner lowland of rich black soil, thus gaining the name of the black belt. The lowland is enclosed by an upland or escarpment, known as Chunnenugga Ridge, sustained by partly consolidated sandy strata. However, the upland is not continuous, but a maturely dissected escarpment. It has a relatively rapid descent toward the inner lowland, and a very gradual descent to the coast prairies, which become very low, flat and marshy before dipping under the Gulf waters, where they are generally fringed by off-shore reefs.  Mississippi embayment  The coastal plain extends inland on the axis of the Mississippi embayment. Its inner border affords admirable examples of topographical discordance where it sweeps northwestward square across the trend of the piedmont belt, the ridges and valleys, and the plateau of the Appalachians. All of which are terminated by dipping gently beneath the unconformable cover of the coastal plain strata. In the same way the western side of the embayment, trending south and southwest, passes along the lower southeastern side of the dissected Ozark plateau of southern Missouri and northern and central Arkansas. The southern Missouri and northern Arkansas Ozark plateau resembles in many ways the Appalachian plateau. The Ozarks and Ouachitas make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains. As the coastal plain turns westward toward Texas, it borders the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma and the Arbuckle Mountains in southern Oklahoma. The Ouachitas and the Arbuckles may be considered an analog of and possible extension of the Appalachian fold and crystalline belts.  Mississippi drainage basin  In the embayment of the coastal plain some low escarpment- like belts of hills with associated strips of lowlands suggest the features of a belted coastal plain. The hilly belt or dissected escarpment determined by the Grand Gulf formation in western Mississippi is the most distinct. Important salt deposits occur in the coastal plain strata near the coast. The most striking feature of the embayment is the broad valley which the Mississippi has eroded across it. The Missouri River (center) joins with the Upper Mississippi River (right), more than doubling the flow south (left). Wood River, Illinois is in the foreground. The small proportion of total water volume supplied from the great Missouri River basin is due to the light precipitation in that region. The lower Mississippi has no large tributaries from the lower east, but two important ones come from the west. The Mississippi Arkansas drainage area being a little less than the Ohio River and the basin of the Red River of Louisiana being about half as large. The Mississippi River drains an area of about one-third of the United States. The head of the coastal plain embayment is near the junction of the Ohio and the Mississippi. It flows southward for through the semi-consolidated strata of the plain. The river has eroded a valley about wide enclosed by bluffs one or two hundred feet high in the northern part. These bluffs decrease towards the south, but with local increase of height associated with a decrease in flood plain breadth on the eastern side where the Grand Gulf escarpment is traversed. This valley in the coastal plain, with the much narrower rock- walled valley of the upper river in the prairie states, is the true valley of the Mississippi River. However, in popular usage, the Mississippi valley is taken to include a large central part of the Mississippi drainage basin. The valley floor is covered with a floodplain of fine silt, having a southward slope of only half a foot to a mile (100 mm/km). The length of the river itself, from the Ohio mouth to the Gulf is about due to its windings. Its mean fall is about 3 inches per mile (50 mm/km). On account of the rapid deposition of sediment near the main channel at times of overflow, the flood plain, as is normally the case on mature valley floors, has a lateral slope of as much as 5, 10, or even in the first mile from the river, but this soon decreases to a less amount. Thus just a short distance from the river, the flood plain is often swampy, unless its surface is there aggraded by the tributary streams. For this reason Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi rank immediately after Florida in swamp area. The great river receives an abundant load of silt from its tributaries, and takes up and lays down silt from its own bed and banks with every change of velocity. The swiftest current follows the outer side of every significant curve in the channel. Thus the concave bank on the side of the fastest part of the river is worn away. Any chance irregularity is exaggerated, and in time a series of large serpentines or meanders is developed, the most-symmetrical examples at present being those near Greenville, Mississippi. The growth of the meanders tends to give the river continually increasing length. This tendency is counteracted by the sudden occurrence of cut-offs from time to time, so that a fairly constant length is maintained. The floods of the Mississippi usually occur in spring or summer. Owing to the great size of the drainage basin, it seldom happens that the three upper tributaries are simultaneously flooded. It is a serious problem for the lower river if two of the large tributaries flood at the same time. In this case, the lower river will rise to 30, 40 or even . The fall of the river is significantly steepened and its velocity is accelerated down stream from the point of highest rise. Conversely, the fall and the velocity are both diminished up stream from the same point. The load of silt carried down stream by the river finally, after many halts on the way, reaches the waters of the Gulf. There, the decrease of velocity aided by the salinity of the sea water, causes the formation of a remarkable delta, leaving less aggraded areas as shallow lakes (Lake Pontchartrain on the east, and Grand Lake on the west of the river). The ordinary triangular form of deltas, due to the smoothing of the delta front by sea action, is here wanting, because of the weakness of sea action in comparison with the strength of the current in each of the four distributaries or passes into which the river divides near its mouth.  Coastal plain in Louisiana and Texas  After constriction from the Mississippi embayment to in western Louisiana, the coastal plain continues southwestward with this breadth until it narrows to about in southern Texas near the crossing of the Colorado River (Texas Colorado River, not the Colorado River that flows through the Grand Canyon), but it again widens to at the national boundary as a joint effect of embayment up the valley of the Rio Grande and of the seaward advance of this river's rounded delta front. These several changes take place in a distance of about . It includes a region of over , less than half of the large state of Texas. A belted arrangement of reliefs and soils, resulting from differential erosion on strata of unlike composition and resistance, characterizes almost the entire area of the coastal plain. Most of the plain is treeless prairie, but the sandier belts are forested. Two of them are known as cross timbers, because their trend is transverse to the general course of the main consequent rivers. An inland extension from the coastal plain in north-central Texas leads to a large escarpment known as Grand Prairie (not structurally included in the coastal plain), upheld at altitudes of 1,200 or by a resistant Cretaceous limestone. This dips gently seaward with its scalloped inland-facing escarpment overlooking a denuded central prairie region of irregular structure and form. Its gentle coastward slope of per mile (3 m/km) is dissected by many branching consequent streams. In its southernpart as it approaches the Colorado river, the escarpment is dissected into a belt of discontinuous hills. The western cross timbers follow a sandy belt along the inner base of the ragged escarpment of Grand Prairie. The eastern cross timbers follow another sandy belt in the lowland between the eastern slope of Grand Prairie and the pale western escarpment of the immediately eastward and lower Black Prairie escarpment. This escarpment is supported at an altitude of or less by a chalk formation, which gives an infacing slope some in height. Its gently undulating or rolling seaward slope of 2 or 3 ft per mile (500 mm/km), covered with marly strata and rich black soil, determines an important cotton district. Then comes the East Texas timber belt, broad in the northeast, narrowing to a point before reaching the Rio Grande, a low and thoroughly dissected escarpment of sandy Eocene strata. This is followed by the Coast Prairie, a very young plain, with a seaward slope of less than 2 ft per mile (400 mm/km), its smooth surface interrupted only by the still more nearly level flood plains of the shallow, consequent river valleys. Near the Colorado river, the dissected escarpment of the Grand Prairie passes southward changing to a more nearly horizontal structure into the dissected Edwards plateau. The Edwards plateau is referred to later as part of the Great Plains. The plateau terminates in a maturely dissected fault scarp approximately 300 or in height as the northern boundary of the Rio Grande embayment. From the Colorado to the Rio Grande, the Black Prairie, the timber belt and the Coast Prairie merge in a vast plain, little differentiated, overgrown with chaparral (shrub-like trees, often thorny), widening eastward in the Rio Grande delta and extending southward into Mexico. Although the Coast Prairie is a sea bottom of very modern uplift, it appears already to have suffered a slight movement of depression. Its small rivers all enter embayments. However, the larger rivers seem to have counteracted the encroachment of the sea on the land by a sufficiently active delta building with a resulting forward growth of the land into the sea. The Mississippi has already been mentioned as rapidly building forward its digitate delta. The Rio Grande, next in size, has built its delta about forward from the general coastline. Since this river is much smaller than the Mississippi, its delta front is rounded by seashore effects. In front of the Brazos and the Colorado, the largest of the Texan rivers, the coast-line is very gently bowed forward as if by delta growth. The sea touches the mainland in a nearly straight shore line. Nearly all the rest of the coast is fringed by off-shore reefs or barrier islands, built up by waves from the very shallow sea bottom. Due to the weak tides, the barrier islands continue in long unbroken stretches between the few inlets. Habitats The northern region uplands are dominated by pine, originally longleaf and slash in the south and shortleaf mixed with hardwoods in the north. These are wildfire-maintained systems that give way to loblolly pine and hardwoods in damper areas and bottomland hardwood forest in extensive lowland drainages. The southern region has tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and western Gulf coastal grasslands. They include large habitats of freshwater wetlands, salt marshes, and coastal mangrove swamps.Gulf Coast / Yucatan - Mexico, Ducks Unlimited Much of the lower elevation Gulf Coastal Plain supports wintering waterfowl.Ducks Unlimited: Gulf Coastal Prairie Groundwater A global satellite study by German and USA scientists spanning the last decade indicates groundwater resources are shrinking due to overuse causing regional water security uncertainty in a changing climate.

Biography Levi Twiggs memorial in Laurel Hill Cemetery Born in Richmond County, Georgia, Twiggs was commissioned a second lieutenant on 10 November 1813. During the War of 1812, he saw action on board President and was captured when that frigate was taken by a squadron of four British warships. After being imprisoned at Bermuda, he was freed when word of the Treaty of Ghent reached that island. Over two decades later, he took part in the Seminole Wars in Florida and Georgia in 1836 and 1837, and achieved the rank of major in November 1840. When the war with Mexico opened, Major Twiggs requested an active part in the fighting and was attached to the Marine Battalion which left New York in June 1847. He fell to enemy fire as he led a storming party in the assault on Chapultepec before Mexico City on 13 September 1847 and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

The association represents over 12,000 football players and 400 football teams across Italy. Serie D ranks just below Serie C (the third and last professional league since 2014‚Äì15), and is thus considered the fourth-ranked league in the country. It is organized by the Roman Comitato Interregionale (Interregional Committee), a \\"league in the league\\" inside the LND. History In 1948 the three leagues running Division 3 (Serie C) had to be reorganized due to an ever-growing number of regional teams. FIGC decided not to relegate the excess teams to regional championships. It chose the winners and a few runners-up from the 36 Serie C championships to be added to the new third division set up into 4 groups. The rest of the teams joined the new Promozione, which changed its name in 1952 into IV Serie (Fourth Division) and then in 1959 into Serie D. From 1959 each player in the Serie D championships had to opt for semi-professional status, by signing a specially issued status attribution form. The championship was thus included in the Lega Nazionale Semiprofessionisti, today known as Lega Pro. Serie D was re-organized in 1981 when championships were reduced. The league name changed into the Interregional. Players lost semi-pro status and converted to amateurs. The championship subsequently passed into the Lega Nazionale Dilettanti. From 1992 to 1999 the name changed into Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti before eventually returning to the current Serie D name. With the merger of the Lega Pro's two divisions at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season (as decided by the FIGC and Lega Pro in November 2012) to reestablish Serie C, Serie D and the leagues below it moved up by one level in the pyramid system, reducing the number of leagues in Italian football to nine. Structure Since the early 1990s, Serie D has consisted of 162 teams split into 9 regional divisions (Gironi), usually formed of 18 teams each, divided geographically. For the 2012‚Äì13 season, there were 166 teams. Two groups (B and C) were formed of 20 teams. In the 2013‚Äì14 season the number was 161 and one group (H) comprised 17 teams. For 2014‚Äì15 the distribution by region was as follows: * Girone A ‚Äì teams from Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria and Lombardy. * Girone B ‚Äì teams from Lombardy and Veneto. * Girone C ‚Äì teams from Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol and Veneto. * Girone D ‚Äì teams from Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Veneto. * Girone E ‚Äì teams from Lazio, Tuscany and Umbria. * Girone F ‚Äì teams from Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche and Molise. * Girone G ‚Äì teams from Lazio and Sardinia. * Girone H ‚Äì teams from Apulia, Basilicata and Campania. * Girone I ‚Äì teams from Calabria, Campania and Sicily. Promotions The first-placed team from each division is promoted to Serie C each year, replacing 9 teams from Lega Pro relegated to Serie D. If a newly promoted Serie D team fails to meet the requirements, Lega Pro asks the second-placed team in that Serie D team's division to fill the vacancy. Failing that, the third-placed team may fill the vacancy, and so on. In recent years, one or more teams from the professional leagues have normally failed to meet the regulatory or financial requirements in order to participate. This usually creates vacancies that get announced in the summer rest period as the new season is being organized. As teams move up to fill the void created by these failed teams or teams in the lowest professional division fail, spaces are created in Serie C (or Lega Pro Seconda Divisione prior to the 2014‚Äì15 season) that need to be filled. For example, in the 2007‚Äì08 season there were nine such failures, and thus, nine Lega Pro Seconda Divisione spaces were created. Four of those spaces were filled by calling back teams that had played in Seconda Divisione but were relegated to Serie D for the next season. The other five vacancies were filled by Serie D teams that had participated in the Serie D playoffs. Playoffs Playoffs are held at the conclusion of the regular season and involve teams placed second through fifth in each division. The first two rounds are single game elimination matches played at the home of the higher-classified team. Games ending in ties are extended to extra time. Since the 2007‚Äì08 season, if games are still tied after extra time, the higher classified team is declared the winner. No penalty shootout takes place. In round one, for each division, the 5th-placed team is matched against the 2nd- placed team, and the 4th-placed team is matched against the 3rd-placed team. Round two matches together the two winners. At the end of round two, one team from each division survives and the nine winners are grouped into 3 groups of three and play each team in their own group once (one at home and one away). The three group winners qualify for the play-off semi-finals. Since 2007‚Äì08, the Coppa Italia Serie D winner qualifies for the 4th semi-final spot. The semi-finals are a two-legged tie, with the winners qualifying for a one-game final match played at a neutral site. The playoff results provide the league with a list from which it may choose teams to fill vacancies in Serie C. The number of teams promoted through this method can vary each year; for example in 2007‚Äì08, the top 5 placed play-off teams were selected to fill vacancies, however, in 2006‚Äì07, no teams were needed to fill vacancies. Relegations Playout After the regular season is complete, bottom teams in each division play a double-leg series (6th-last vs 3rd-last, 5th-last vs 4th-last). The winners remain in Serie D for the following season. The two losers are relegated to Eccellenza, a regional amateur league below this, for a total of 4 relegations in each division, 36 in total for the league. There are no play- out if the difference between 6th-last vs 3rd-last and that between 5th-last vs 4th-last is bigger than eight points. Tie-Breakers Serie D does not use head-to-head results to order teams that are tied in points in certain situations, single-game tie-breakers are held at neutral sites instead. Those situations are the following: * a tie between 1st and 2nd place, where the winner would get a direct promotion to Seconda Divisione and loser qualifies for the play-offs. * a tie between 5th and 6th place, where only the winner would qualify to participate in the play-offs. * a tie between 7th-last and 6th-last, where the winner avoids participating in the relegation play-out. * a tie between 3rd-last and 2nd-last, where the winner qualifies for the relegation play-out and the loser is directly relegated. Head-to-head results are used in all other situations, such as when all the teams involved are qualified in the promotional playoffs, or all teams are participating in the relegation playoffs.  Scudetto Serie D  Each year, at the end of the regular season, the winners of the nine Serie D divisions qualify for a championship tournament in order to assign the so-called Scudetto Dilettanti (amateur champions' title). Round one divides the nine teams into three groups of three teams each where each team plays a single game against each of its other two opponents. The three group winners and best second-placed team advance to the semifinals. The first scudetto dilettanti was assigned in 1952‚Äì1953, when the Serie D was still called IV Serie (fourth division). Its assignment was suspended from 1958‚Äì1959 to 1991‚Äì1992. =Champions= *1952‚Äì53 ‚Äì Catanzaro *1953‚Äì54 ‚Äì Bari *1954‚Äì55 ‚Äì Colleferro *1955‚Äì56 ‚Äì Siena *1956‚Äì57 ‚Äì Sarom Ravenna *1957‚Äì58 ‚Äì Cosenza, Ozo Mantova & Spezia (ex-aequo) *1958‚Äì59 ‚Äì Cascina *1959‚Äì60 to 1961‚Äì62 ‚Äì Title assigned to the winning groups of Prima Categoria *1962‚Äì63 to 1991‚Äì92 ‚Äì Title not assigned *1992‚Äì93 ‚Äì Eurobuilding Crevalcore *1993‚Äì94 ‚Äì Pro Vercelli *1994‚Äì95 ‚Äì Taranto *1995‚Äì96 ‚Äì Castel San Pietro *1996‚Äì97 ‚Äì Biellese *1997‚Äì98 ‚Äì Giugliano *1998‚Äì99 ‚Äì Lanciano *1999‚Äì2000 ‚Äì Sangiovannese *2000‚Äì01 ‚Äì Palmese *2001‚Äì02 ‚Äì Olbia *2002‚Äì03 ‚Äì Cavese *2003‚Äì04 ‚Äì Massese *2004‚Äì05 ‚Äì Bassano Virtus *2005‚Äì06 ‚Äì Paganese *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì Tempio *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì Aversa Normanna *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì Pro Vasto *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì Montichiari *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì Cuneo *2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì Venezia *2012‚Äì13 ‚Äì Ischia *2013‚Äì14 ‚Äì Pordenone *2014‚Äì15 ‚Äì Robur Siena *2015‚Äì16 ‚Äì Viterbese *2016‚Äì17 ‚Äì Monza *2017‚Äì18 ‚Äì Pro Patria *2018‚Äì19 ‚Äì Avellino *2019‚Äì20 ‚Äì Not assigned See also *Italian football league system Notes  References   External links  * Official website of the Serie D * News of Serie D * Tutti i gironi della serie D su Calciotel 5 Category:1948 establishments in Italy Category:Sports leagues established in 1948 Ita ","title":"Serie D"},{"id":"1165624","text":"The Vigiles or more properly the Vigiles Urbani (\\"watchmen of the City\\") or Cohortes Vigilum (\\"cohorts of the watchmen\\") were the firefighters and police of Ancient Rome. History The Triumviri Nocturni (meaning three men of the night) were the first men, being privately owned slaves, organized into a group that combated the common problems of fire and conflagrations in Rome. The privately operated system became ineffective, so in the interest of keeping himself and Rome safe, Augustus instituted a new public firefighting force called the Vigiles. Augustus modelled the new firefighters after the fire brigade of Alexandria, Egypt. The Vigiles were also known by their nickname Spartoli or \\"little bucket fellows\\" which was given to them because of the buckets they carried water in, which were made of rope sealed with pitch. In AD 6, Augustus levied a 4% tax on the sale of slaves and used the proceeds to set up the new force. They were commanded by the praefectus vigilum, who was of equestrian rank, and subpraefectus and were divided into seven cohorts commanded by a tribune. Each cohort was divided into seven centuries, each of 70-80 men commanded by a centurion. Each cohort patrolled two of the city's fourteen administrative regiones. The cohorts were doubled in size in AD 205. The Vigiles also acted as a night watch, keeping an eye out for burglars and hunting down runaway slaves, and were on occasion used to maintain order in the streets. Their most famous prefect, Naevius Sutorius Macro, succeeded Lucius Aelius Sejanus as Prefect of the Praetorian Guard after his men had been used by the Emperor Tiberius to retake control of the city from Sejanus's soldiers. Vigiles were stationed at the harbour cities of Ostia and Portus. A vexillatio (detachment) of four centuries was detached from Rome for four months at a time, with two centuries being stationed at each city. The Vigiles appear to have lost their status as an independent unit and come under the authority of the Praetorian prefects sometime in the early 3rd century. Organization In the beginning, the corps had difficulty recruiting men. In an effort to entice men to enlist the Lex Visellia was passed in 24 AD, granting full citizenship and a bonus cash stipend to Vigiles after six years of service. By the 2nd century, citizens were also allowed to enlist. The Vigiles were accommodated in barracks and patrolled the streets, especially at night, on the lookout for any unsupervised fires. Every householder was obliged to keep equipment for fighting fires, and the men themselves were equipped with pumps, buckets, hooks (for pulling down burning material), picks, mattocks and axes. They also used ballistae for knocking down burning houses and creating firebreaks. They even had their own medical support (medici), with four doctors attached to each cohort, and their own chaplains (victimarii). A siphonarius operated a pump and an aquarius supervised the supply of water. The ordinary firefighters were called milites (soldiers).  Duties  = Fighting fires = Every cohort was equipped with standard firefighting equipment. The sipho or fire engine was pulled by horses and consisted of a large double action pump that was partially submerged in a reservoir of water. The Vigiles designated as aquarii needed to have an accurate knowledge of where water was located, and they also formed bucket brigades to bring water to the fire. Attempts were made to smother the fire by covering it with patchwork quilts (centones) soaked with water. There is even evidence that chemical firefighting methods were used by throwing a vinegar based substance called acetum into fires. In many cases the best way to prevent the spread of flames was to tear down the burning building with hooks and levers. For fires in multiple story buildings, cushions and mattresses were spread out on the ground for people to jump onto from the upper levels. A major duty of the Vigiles was to enforce preventative measures against conflagrations. Adequate fire fighting equipment was required in every home. The Digest of Justinian decrees that Vigiles are \\"ordered to remind every one to have a supply of water ready in his upper room\\". While the Vigiles only had advising authority, their recommendations were often followed to avoid repercussions for negligence. Corporal punishment was the most common punishment for negligence according to the Digest of Justinian, \\"where persons have paid insufficient attention to their fire, the prefect ... orders them to be beaten\\". During the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 over one third of Rome was destroyed by flames. The young Emperor Nero helped to direct the Vigiles in fighting the flames. It was rumoured that the Vigiles intentionally allowed the city to burn under orders from Nero, who later built his palace on land that was cleared by the fire. Regardless, Nero enacted fire code laws following the Great Fire to avoid further conflagrations. These laws called for more public access to water and prohibited buildings from sharing a common wall. =Police force= Starting about 27 BC, Augustus added a police function to the Vigiles to counterbalance the urban mobs that had run rampant during the latter days of the Republic. In addition to extinguishing fires, the Vigiles were the nightwatch of Rome. Their duties included apprehending thieves and robbers and capturing runaway slaves. The task of guarding the baths was added as a duty of the Vigiles during the reign of Alexander Severus when the baths remained open during the night. They dealt primarily with petty crimes and looked for disturbances of the peace while they patrolled the streets. Sedition, riots and violent crimes were handled by the Cohortes urbanae and (to a lesser extent) the Praetorian Guard, though Vigiles could provide a supporting role in these situations. The Vigiles were not considered a para-military unit. =Quarters= Graffiti from wardroom of 7th Cohort The first Vigiles sequestered private homes and buildings to use as their command posts. It was not until the mid-2nd century that official stations were built explicitly for the Vigiles' use. By the early 3rd century sub-stations (excubitoria), which held forty to fifty men, were constructed to accommodate the expanding city and the surrounding suburbs. The locations of four of the seven cohort stationes or barracks have been fairly definitively identified: * I Cohort: On the east side of the Via Lata opposite the Saepta; * III Cohort: On Viminal; * IV Cohort: Near Baths of Caracalla; * V Cohort: On Caelian Hill near present site of S. Maria in Domnica. The VII Cohort was probably housed in a statio provisionally identified near the Aemiian Bridge. As mentioned elsewhere detachments of watchmen were stationed at Ostia and Portus and there were sub-stations throughout the city. What arrangements were made for policing the outer suburbs of the city is not known. (Certainly after the governmental reforms of Diocletian the jurisdiction of the Praefectus Urbi extended as far as the east coast and for in every direction. This might suggest that his subordinate, the Praefectus Vigilum, had a commensurate responsibility.) Prefect of the Vigiles Also known as the Prefect of the Watch, the Prefect of the Vigiles was an eques appointed by the emperor to command the seven cohorts. It was not a particularly sought after office until the 3rd century. Prominent jurists with a legal background began serving as Prefect to fulfil the magisterial capacity of the office. As a judge, the Prefect made rulings in his court for the common thieves caught during the night. Eventually, the Prefect was given jurisdiction over daytime petty crimes as well. According to Justinian, in the event of more serious crimes the decision was made by the praefectus urbi, \\"if the offender is a person of such thuggish and infamous character ... the case is sent on to the prefect of the city\\". Beyond the office of the prefect, the Vigiles were ordered by rank similar to the military. While some terms of service could extend beyond twenty years, most commissioned ranks were much shorter. Since the Vigiles never achieved the prestige of the Praetorian Guard or the Urban Cohorts, serving in the corps was usually only a means of achieving more honourable and lucrative posts. One known praefectus, Placidianus was put in charge of an expeditionary force sent to Gaul by Claudius II (Gothicus) on his accession in 269 AD to secure the lower Rhone valley against the so-called Gallic Empire. This is the only known instance of the holder of this office being given a substantive command outside Rome. Whether or not his force included vigiles from the city is uncertain. Whether or not the Praefectus Vigilum had his headquarters in any of the stationes identified above or whether he had an entirely separate praefectura is not known. If he is associated with one of the barracks it is likely to have been that of I Cohort in the Via Lata. In popular culture The Vigiles often play a prominent role in the Marcus Didius Falco novels of Lindsey Davis, providing assistance in Falco's investigations. In particular, Falco's old army friend Lucius Petronius Longus is a 'Watch Captain' in Regio XIII. In Death in Vesunna by Harry Turtledove, the vigiles of Vesunna, Roman Gaul (now modern P√©rigueux, France) are tasked to hunt down two murderers from the future, whose victim was a prominent citizen in the city whom they murdered with a pistol.

His wife and four children have Norwegian citizenship, but not Krekar himself. He speaks Kurdish, Arabic, Persian, some Norwegian and English. Krekar was the original leader of the Islamist armed group Ansar al-Islam, which was set up and commenced operations in Northern Iraq while he had refugee status in Norway. Krekar claims, however, not to have had foreknowledge of the various terrorist attacks performed by the group he was leading. Since February 2003 he has an expulsion order against him, which is suspended pending Iraqi government guarantees that he will not face torture or execution. Norway is committed to international treaties which prohibit the expulsion of an individual without such a guarantee. Kurdish authorities in the Kurdistan Regional Government have repeatedly asked for Mullah Krekar to be extradited from Norway. The death penalty remains on the books in the Kurdistan region. Most death sentences have been changed into life sentences since the Kurdish authorities took power in 1992, the exception being that eleven alleged members of Ansar al-Islam were hanged in the regional capital of Erbil in October 2006. He has as of 8 December 2006 been on the UN terror list,\\"mullah Krekar oppf√∏rt p√• FNs terrorliste\\", VG and as of 8 November 2007 been judged by the Supreme Court of Norway as a \\"danger to national security\\".\\"H√∏yesterett: Mulla Krekar fare for rikets sikkerhet\\", NRK On March 26, 2012 he was sentenced to 5 years in prison for making repeated death threats against Norwegian politicians and the Kurds if they pursued certain civil actions against him. He has appealed this prison sentence. The next day, March 27, 2012, he was arrested by the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) and Norwegian Police and taken into protective custody and incarceration. This occurred after certain additional statements of a threatening nature were linked to him, suggesting that others might take retaliatory actions against Norwegians if his civil prison sentence were implemented.\\"PST vil varetektsfengsle Krekar\\", Dagbladet On March 26, 2020 he was extradited to Italy.\\"Krekar sendt ut av landet ‚Äì Frp feirer med kake\\", NRK. \\"[...] p√• en hasteinnkalt pressekonferanse torsdag ettermiddag. ‚Äì Krekar er ikke lenger i Norge. Krekar er i dag utlevert til Italia, sa M√¶land.\\" Krekar in Norway =Proceedings against Krekar= In August 2002, while Krekar was in Iraq, the Norwegian government revoked his refugee status on the grounds that he had traveled back to his homeland and spent long periods there. Krekar was arrested in the Netherlands at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam in September 2002, after Iran denied him entry and sent him back to Europe. He was interviewed by FBI agents (at Krekar's request, in an attempt to clear his and his group's name); no extradition request was made. He was deported to Norway in January 2003. In February 2003 the Norwegian government ordered Krekar to be deported to Iraq, but as of July 2009 the order had not been implemented because of the security environment in Iraq, and the risk that Krekar could face the death penalty there, as Norway will not deport people in these circumstances. Krekar has unsuccessfully challenged the expulsion order in court, with the order being confirmed in September 2005. Norway's government has said that the new government to be elected in Iraq in December 2005 might permit discussion on whether Krekar's expulsion order can be implemented. On March 21, 2003 his arrest was ordered by √òkokrim, the Norwegian law enforcement agency for financial crime, to ensure he did not leave the country while accusations that he had financed terrorist attacks using Norway as a base were investigated. Court proceedings against Krekar were however dropped when it proved impossible to prove his connections with the terrorist attacks staged in Iraq by Ansar al-Islam during his leadership. His term as leader ended. The United States government has declared Ansar al- Islam a terrorist group, but Krekar denies that it was during the time he headed it, and says he no longer does. While Krekar has not been found guilty of anything, a number of his opinions have met little sympathy; he was once recorded claiming that Osama bin Laden is the \\"jewel in the crown of Islam\\".-Osama bin Laden is a good Muslim VG and that he was proud of what Abu Musab al-Zarqawi \\"has done and that he has become a martyr\\".Krekar honors al- Zarqawi Aftenposten In September 2005 the Iraqi Justice Minister Abdel Hussein Shandal said that Krekar was wanted in Iraq and should be tried there. About the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, he said to the Norwegian media \\"This is a declaration of war against of our religion, our faith, and our civilization. We Muslims are ready for this.\\"\\\\- Now this is war TV 2 Krekar told the Kurdish magazine Awene that he wants to return to Iraq to fight openly against the Iraqi government and the coalition, but that he lacked travel documents from the Norwegian government. He confirmed to a Norwegian newspaper that he had been correctly quoted.-Jeg vil reise hjem Dagbladet The Norwegian minister of labour and migration, Bjarne H√•kon Hanssen, responded that Krekar could leave at any time and that he would be given \\"travel documents within the day. He'll also get money for airline tickets, taxi cab, and the whole deal. If he really wants to go, that is.\\"\\"Hvis Krekar vil til Irak, skal han f√• reisedokumenter p√• dagen\\" Dagbladet On December 7, 2006, the United States Department of the Treasury designated mullah Krekar as one of five individuals providing financial support to terrorist organizations. In a statement he is accused of providing funds for Ansar al-Sunnah, an active Iraqi terror-organization descended from Ansar al- Islam. The press release states that \\"This designation freezes any assets the designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits all financial and commercial transactions by any U.S. person with the designees\\". Mullah Krekar was later that day added to the United Nations Security Council list of individuals belonging to or associated with the Al-Qaeda organization. All member states of the United Nations are obliged to freeze assets and prevent entry or transit through their territories with regard to the individuals included on the list. Anders Romarheim, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, believes that the placement of mullah Krekar on this list is a United States strategy to put pressure on Norway.Krekar tops US terrorist list Aftenposten On November 8, 2007, the Supreme Court of Norway ruled that Krekar is a threat to Norway's national security, thus upholding the February 2003 decision by the government to deport him to Iraq. It is still unclear when Krekar will be deported due to Iraq's death penalty laws. Some politicians asked for Krekar to be put in jail until he is deported.Krekar Can Go Aftenposten =Threat against Mariwan Halabjaee= In an audio file published on the Kurdish website Renesans.nu during September 2008, Krekar allegedly threatened to kill Mariwan Halabjaee, the Iraqi Kurdish author of Sex, Sharia and Women in the History of Islam, who also resided in Norway. \\"I swear that we will not live if you live. Either you go before us, or we go before you,\\" said Krekar.  * Krekar compared Halabjaee with Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  In February 2012, Krekar confirmed in the Oslo District Court that he had issued a twenty-page fatwa against Halabjaee.  * * The fatwa was sent to several hundred Islamic scholars around the world. While Krekar said he thought he might be able to \\"guarantee the safety\\" of Halabjaee, Krekar confirmed that his fatwa \\"implies\\" that it is \\"permissible\\" to kill Halabjaee in Oslo or anywhere else. Krekar compared Halabjaee to Theo van Gogh, the film director who was killed by an Islamist in the Netherlands in 2004. =Terrorism charges against Krekar= Mullah Krekar at the meeting with the foreign press in Oslo where he made statements about Erna Solberg On July 12, 2011, terrorism charges were filed against Krekar for a death threat he uttered against ex-minister Erna Solberg during a news conference in June 2010.https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/n8Mko/pst-vil-ha-krekar-tiltalt-for-terrortrusler =CIA, Pentagon, and Navy SEALs= In 2003, agents for the CIA, including Cynthia Dame Logan and Gregory Asherleighs, were sent to Norway. translation, mirror translation, mirror They arrived directly after the abduction of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr from Milan, Italy. A few days before their arrival, Mullah Krekar's lawyer, Brynjar Meling, asked for police protection of Krekar. The Norwegian Intelligence Service admits it had knowledge of the agents' visit to Norway, and Meling confirms he had heard rumours that Krekar was to be kidnapped and transferred to Guantanamo Bay. If the operation was not approved beforehand by Norway it would have been a violation of Norwegian law. Mullah Krekar was not kidnapped. According to an article in Newsweek, a Pentagon official proposed inserting a US Navy SEAL team to engage in a \\"snatch rope\\" operation against Krekar; however, the plan was allegedly rejected because a shooting confrontation between the SEALs and Norwegian police would have triggered a diplomatic disaster between Norway and the United States. However, a week later the Los Angeles Times quoted a high ranking intelligence official who claimed that U.S. special forces were in fact inserted in a European country allied with the United States through NATO, in order to carry out a snatch operation under strikingly similar circumstances to the Krekar case. The revelation led to suspicion that the plan was in fact not cancelled, as the Pentagon had stated. According to the Norwegian newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad, which was the original source of the CIA agents' mission in Oslo, the U.S. special forces, most likely Navy SEALs, had been monitoring a \\"militant leader\\" over a period of time, and were in place ready to carry out the snatch. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Pentagon kept the allied country's government in the dark about the mission, which apparently failed or was aborted. =Offered cash for leaving Norway= In April 2006, Pakistani-Norwegian businessman Tasawer \\"Tommy\\" Sharif offered Krekar NOK 500,000 (approx. US$60,000) if he left Norway, saying that Krekar was \\"a pest for all Muslims in Norway.\\" Krekar rejected the offer. =Facebook group collecting donations for the assassination of Mullah Krekar= In November 2007, Norwegian newspapers published the story that a Facebook group had been set up, dedicated to collecting money which would eventually go to an assassin, should one be located. The group statement started with \\"For the murder of Norway's enemy #1\\". The 28-year-old man who started the group went on to publicize not only his full name, but also a bank account number where money could be deposited. The group had approximately 400 members when Krekar's lawyer deemed the threat \\"serious\\" and said he \\"hoped the police would investigate the people involved\\".Taking donations for the assassination of Krekar Aftenposten The 28-year-old told Norwegian media that the statement was facetious and thus should not be taken literally. =Popular culture references= In November 2007, Mullah Krekar was the subject of a half-hour investigative report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC-TV) international affairs program Foreign Correspondent. The report, titled \\"Norwegian Jihad\\", was also the centrepiece of a one-hour special report on Norwegian State Television. \\"Norwegian Jihad\\" was also broadcast throughout the Asia Pacific region on ABC-TV's satellite service \\"Australia Network\\". In July 2009, Mullah Krekar was one of the subjects of the NBC's pilot episode of the show The Wanted, describing him as \\"responsible for killing hundreds of westerners\\". In early 2012, the Netflix series Lillyhammer featured a scene in which a Norwegian police officer gets into an argument with an Arab immigrant over whether the show 24 is unfair to Arabs, and when his partner intercedes, he complains that the immigrant \\"is giving me the whole Mullah Krekar routine over here\\". =Assassination attempt= During the night of 24 January 2010, 3 shots were fired through one of the windows of Krekar's apartment in Oslo.

On 26 March 2012, Krekar was re-arrested for making threats against two Kurds and the Conservative Party leader Erna Solberg. On August 29, 2012, Oslo District Court tacked an additional year onto the five Mullah Krekar had been sentenced to in March 2012. =Decision on appeal= On 6 December 2012, the Court of Appeal acquitted Krekar of charges of incitement to terrorism, but found Krekar guilty of four counts of intimidation under aggravating circumstances. The Court of Appeal ordered that Krekar pay 130,000 kroner in damages compensation to each of the three Kurds he threatened, and to serve two years and ten months in prison, less the 255 days he was in custody. =Political advocacy= For the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election Krekar called on Muslims in Norway to vote for either the Labour Party, the Socialist Left Party or the Red Party. He explained that since there was not yet enough Muslims in Norway to form a separate political bloc, Muslims had many strategies in common with Norwegian leftists.\\"Mullah Krekar: - Stem p√• Ap, SV eller R√∏dt\\".

Krekar is quoted in this article saying that when a cartoonist \\"tramples on our dignity, our principles and our faith, he must die.\\" The aforementioned article also reports that, \\"Krekar, who was only freed from prison late last month, was arrested Thursday night on accusations of inciting crime, police said.\\" Therefore, the primary reason for Krekar's arrest by the Norwegian Police was the allegation that he incited crime by his statements. The article cites no other reason for Krekar's arrest. Krekar's statements refer to the Charlie Hebdo newspaper whose cartoonists were gunned down in Paris for allegedly drawing cartoons that Kreker refers to. The attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris was described by the French President Fran√ßois Hollande who said, \\"An act of exceptional barbarism has been committed in Paris against a newspaper. A paper, in other words, an organ of free speech.\\" =November 2015 arrest= On 13 November 2015 it was reported that Krekar was arrested in prison\\"Jihadist cell in Europe 'sought recruits for Iraq and Syria.'\\" BBC News Retrieved November 13, 2015. in Norway on 11 November \\"in a coordinated police swoop on Islamist militants planning attacks.\\" He and 14 other Iraqi Kurds and one Kosovar Albanian, were \\"arrested in countries across Europe in collaboration with police from Italy, the UK, Norway, Finland, Germany and Switzerland.\\"\\"15 Islamist Kurds suspected of planning attacks arrested across Europe\\".

His lawyer Brynjar Meling was deeply upset about this turn of events, citing his client's poor health (which include both diabetes and high blood pressure), the coronavirus pandemic in Italy and the subpar condition of the Rebibbia prison, which had recently seen both a mutiny and several deaths owing to the COVID-virus. He is reportedly held in a prison in Sassari, Sardinia.https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/f2a7e985-f00c-4165-8912-2f98895696a5 Krekar's views In November 2009 controversy erupted when Krekar in an interview with the Arab television channel al-Hiwar said he wanted to establish a new Islamic Caliphate in Iraq, claiming that for Jihadists there is no legitimate state, with the exception of the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. For the Islamic \\"super-state\\" he wanted Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaida-top Ayman al-Zawahiri or Hizb-e Islami-founder Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as leader, and other radical Islamists as leader, citing for instance Gulbuddin Hekmatyar or Ayman Al-Zawahiri as the foreign minister.\\"Krekar vil ha islamsk stat ledet av Osama bin Laden\\" As a result, the Progress Party continued their call for the imprisonment of Krekar,\\"Siv Jensen om Krekar-intervju: - H√•rreisende uttalelser\\", VG and the Labour Party stated for the first time they would form a new task force which would examine if people officially labeled as \\"danger to national security\\" could be imprisoned.\\"Krekar kan bli satt bak l√•s og sl√• til v√•ren\\", VG Azzam Tamimi who had done the interview with Krekar, also said that he felt Krekar had been treated badly by secular Kurds in Norway.\\"Krekar-intervjuer: - Han har blitt behandlet d√•rlig\\", VG Mulla Krekar said he would support Kurdish independence \\"wholeheartedly\\" even though he has lost faith in Kurdish parties, but he \\"has no quarrel with any political party\\".

It is the largest body of water in Taiwan. The area around the lake is home to the Thao tribe, one of aboriginal tribes of Taiwan. Sun Moon Lake surrounds a tiny island called Lalu. The east side of the lake resembles a sun while the west side resembles a moon, hence the name. Sun Moon Lake is located above sea level. It is deep and has a surface area of approximately . The area surrounding the lake has many trails for hiking. While swimming in Sun Moon Lake is usually not permitted, there is an annual 3-km race called the Swimming Carnival of Sun Moon Lake held around the Mid-Autumn Festival each year. The Sun Moon Lake Swimming Carnival was launched in 1983 and is listed among Top 50 Open Water Swims in Asia and Top 100 Open Water Swims of the World. Everyone over 10 years old and with ability to swim long distances can join, regardless of nationality. In recent years the participants have numbered in the tens of thousands. Other festivities held at the same time include fireworks, laser shows, and concerts. The lake and its surrounding countryside have been designated one of thirteen national scenic areas in Taiwan. Wen Wu Temple was built after rising water levels from building a dam forced several smaller temples to be removed. Tzu-En Pagoda () was caused to be built by late President Chiang Kai-shek in 1971 in memory of his mother. Other temples of note include Jianjing Temple, Syuentzang Temple () and Syuanguang Temple (). History Taiwanese aborigines at Sun Moon Lake, photo from a 1926 brochure of the Government of Formosa In older English literature, it was commonly referred to as Lake Candidius after the 17th century Dutch missionary Georgius Candidius. In the middle of the lake is the Lalu Island, which is considered holy ground by the Thao tribe. In legend, Thao hunters discovered Sun Moon Lake while chasing a white deer through the surrounding mountains. The deer eventually led them to the lake, which they found to be not only beautiful, but abundant with fish.http://www.sunmoonlake.gov.tw/EN/03000809.aspx Today, the white deer of legends is immortalized as a marble statue on Lalu Island.

After Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan, the island was renamed Kwanghwa Island () and in 1978 the local government built a pavilion where annual weddings took place. In 1999, the 921 earthquake destroyed the pavilion and sank most of the island. In recent years, due to increasing social and political awareness, more deference and recognition are being given to Taiwanese aborigines. As a result, after the 921 earthquake, the island was renamed in the Thao language as \\"Lalu\\". Several hydroelectric power plants have been built in the Sun Moon Lake since 1919, including Mingtan Pumped Storage Hydro Power Plant and Minhu Pumped Storage Hydro Power Station. When the first hydroelectric plant was finished in 1934, it was considered to be one of the most important infrastructure constructions of the time. Wujie Dam, also completed in 1934, diverts water from the Zhuoshui River to increase hydroelectric generation at the lake. The Jiji Line railroad was built to facilitate the construction.

Biography Babbitt was probably born in Brookfield, Massachusetts, and was appointed a midshipman in the Navy on 2 April 1804. He accepted his warrant on 28 May 1804 and entered into service on board the 32-gun frigate , that same day. He served in Essex and in the bomb ketch in the Mediterranean Sea between 1804 and 1806. Returning home to the United States in Spitfire in August 1806, Babbitt joined the frigate in 1807 and had charge of her quarterdeck guns on the occasion of the battle with on 22 June 1807. He was appointed an acting lieutenant and ordered to the brig on 1 February 1810. He cruised the waters along the east coast of the United States in Argus until late October, at which time he was furloughed. Babbitt received his lieutenant's commission on 4 March 1811, with seniority to date from 5 June 1810. On 19 February 1812, he received orders to join and served in her until 17 July 1812 when a British squadron ‚Äì built around the 64-gun ship-of-the-line and the frigates and ‚Äì captured Nautilus off the northern New Jersey coast. Babbitt spent several weeks as a prisoner of war in Halifax, Nova Scotia, before being exchanged. Following his return, he was assigned to the frigate on 30 November 1812 and helped in the futile effort to get that ship ready for sea after her modification into a sloop of war. Though the work was completed by the end of 1812, the British had Adams blockaded in Chesapeake Bay by then, and she remained so until early in 1814. Babbitt's assignment to Adams, however, lasted only until the spring of 1813. On 6 April 1813, he received orders to join the frigate ; but those orders were apparently changed later in the month, and he went to Sackett's Harbor along with the officers and men of the blockaded Adams. In September 1813, Babbitt again received orders to United States to serve as that ship's first lieutenant. United States, however, languished at New London ‚Äì along with her recent prize, , by then also in American service, and the sloop of war ‚Äì under a blockade imposed by a powerful British squadron. In the spring of 1814, the frigate's commanding officer, Captain Stephen Decatur, received a posting to command the 44-gun frigate , and took the crew of United States with him to man his new command. Thus, Babbitt came to be Presidents first lieutenant. Once again, Babbitt found himself assigned to a warship unable to get to sea because of a strong blockade. The frigate remained hemmed in at New York for the rest of 1814. Not until January 1815 did conditions allow President to attempt her escape to sea. Though the peace treaty had been signed in Ghent, Belgium, in December 1814, word had not reached the Americas, and hostilities continued in the western hemisphere for some weeks. Thus, when President made her move for the open sea, British warships stood ready to engage her. In her breakout attempt on 14 January 1815, President ran afoul of another squadron of British ships comprising , , and . During the ensuing fight, President managed to inflict sufficient damage on HMS Endymion to force her out of the struggle, but the unequal contest exacted a greater toll from the American ship. Unable to outrun her other adversaries because of hull damage sustained during a grounding soon after sailing, President finally succumbed to the combined attention of the three remaining British ships after a six-hour exchange in which she lost 24 of her crewmen and three of her lieutenants, including Babbitt.

Li'l Abner comic strip  In Capp's own words, Dogpatch was \\"an average stone-age community nestled in a bleak valley, between two cheap and uninteresting hills somewhere.\\" The inhabitants were mostly lazy hillbillies, who usually wanted nothing to do with progress. Li'l Abner's backwater hometown chiefly consisted of dismal log cabin hovels, pine trees, ‚Äútarnip‚Äù fields and hog wallows‚Äîand was often referred to by its inhabitants and outsiders as being the most miserable and unnecessary place on earth. The menfolk were too lazy to work, yet Dogpatch gals were desperate enough to chase them (see Sadie Hawkins Day). Those who farmed their turnip fields watched Turnip Termites swarm by the billions once a year, locust-like, to devour Dogpatch's only crop (along with their livestock and all their clothing.) Al Capp used to joke that Dogpatch was based on Seabrook, New Hampshire, where he would vacation with his wife, Catherine.Portsmouth Herald: 'Last of the Yankees' A map shown during the story arc of the Shmoo seems to place Dogpatch somewhere around Tennessee or Arkansas. However, one of the earliest (1934) Li'l Abner strips, re-posted on the web by Comics.com in March 2008, explicitly identifies Dogpatch as being in Kentucky and several 1936 strips also clearly place it in Kentucky. One 1936 strip furthermore mentions that Lee City (a small town in eastern Kentucky) is just over 100 miles away by car. The local geography was fluid and vividly complex; Capp continually changed it to suit either his whims or the current storyline. It has been variously situated in a deep valley, at the base of a peak that's precariously balancing an enormous boulder (Teeterin‚Äô Rock), or atop Onnecessary Mountain overlooking an apparently infinite chasm, Bottomless Canyon. It was usually described as situated between the equally fictitious towns of Skonk Hollow (inhabited by lethally dangerous, even more backward mountaineers) and Pineapple Junction. Like the Coconino County depicted in George Herriman's Krazy Kat and the Okefenokee Swamp of Walt Kelly's Pogo, Dogpatch's (and Lower Slobbovia's) distinctive cartoon landscape became as identified with the strip as any of its characters. Local Dogpatch institutions included West Po'kchop Railroad, which ran perpendicularly up one side of Onnecessary Mountain and straight down the other. A stiffnecked industrialist named Stubborn J. Tolliver built its suicidal grade to satisfy a boyish dream of his son, Idiot J. Tolliver. To keep his boy happy, Tolliver starts one train a week up the tracks. Each train falls back with a crash, killing all its passengers.‚ÄúDie Monstersinger‚Äù (Time Magazine - Nov. 6, 1950) Another daily hazard, the Skonk Works, was almost as lethal. Scores have been done in by the fumes of the concentrated \\"skonk\\" oil which is brewed and barreled at the factory by its owner and ‚Äúinside man‚Äù, Big Barnsmell; and his cousin, \\"outside man\\" Barney Barnsmell (see also Skunk Works). Mail was very slow, with the ancient, white- bearded postmaster and his creaky jackass mount (Young Eddie McSkonk and U.S. Mule) often feeling too stressed to deliver the cobweb-covered sacks of timeworn letters marked \\"Rush\\" at the Dogpatch Express post office. Dogpatch's various feature attractions also included Kissin‚Äô Rock (handy to Suicide Cliff), the Jubilation T. Cornpone memorial statue, and Dogpatch Airlines, with decrepit World War I aviator Cap‚Äôn Eddie Ricketyback, proprietor (a pun on Eddie Rickenbacker).  Theme park  In 1967, Al Capp licensed and had an interest in an , $35 million theme park called Dogpatch USA, based on the comic strip's setting. Built in Marble Falls near Harrison, Arkansas, the park closed in 1993 due to mismanagement and financial debt.

The term was used by American chemical engineers such as William J. Wilcox, Jr. and Warren Fuchs, during World War II who were working on the Manhattan Project; the engineers used the term from the comic strip to describe their first Rochester dormitories, with dark and dismal furniture and used beds from an old YMCA, and kept using the term when they transferred to Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Charles Busch wrote both the original play and the screenplay. As the title suggests, Psycho Beach Party, set in 1962 Malibu Beach, is a parody of 1950s psychodramas, 1960s beach movies and 1980s slasher films. Plot Florence Forrest (Lauren Ambrose) is a Gidget-like character determined to learn to surf, and earns the nickname \\"Chicklet\\" from the surfer guys. However Chicklet begins displaying multiple personalities, experiences inexplicable blackouts, and fears that she might be the one responsible for a series of mysterious murders in her beachside town. The deaths are investigated by Captain Monica Stark (Charles Busch), who also suspects Chicklet's mother (Beth Broderick), Chicklet's best friend Berdine (Danni Wheeler), surfing guru the Great Kanaka (Thomas Gibson) and B-movie actress Bettina Barnes (Kimberley Davies). Other characters include university dropout (and Chicklet's love interest) Starcat (Nicholas Brendon), purported Swedish exchange student Lars (Matt Keeslar), surfers Yo-Yo (Nick Cornish) and Provoloney (Andrew Levitas), Starcat's girlfriend Marvel Ann (Amy Adams), and the wheelchair-bound class \\"queen bee\\" Rhonda (Kathleen Robertson).

In the original 1987 production, Charles Busch played the role of Chicklet. Deciding that he might not be believable in the role of a sixteen- year-old girl (\\"while I can still manage, with the aid of a sympathetic cameraman, to play a sophisticated 25, 16 would be a stretch\\"), he added the character of Monica Stark to the movie. After over 20 years, the play had its premiere UK production by Vertigo Theatre Productions in Manchester in March 2011. The production returned in August 2012 at Sacha's Hotel Ballroom. A production was held in Australia at the Bondi Pavilion Theatre from November to December 2012; productions also ran in Melbourne (notably at the Midsumma Festival) in early 2013, receiving generally positive reviews. Reception , the film holds a 55% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews with an average rating of 5.55/10. In a positive review, Stephen Holden of The New York Times states that the film \\"accomplishes what no stage production could. By assiduously copying the look and sound of those '60s movies -- the wriggling title sequences, the twangy surf music and the gawky gee-whiz screen acting style -- it definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge. Most of the play's subversive humor has arrived on the screen intact.\\" Los Angeles Times critic Kevin Thomas compared the film unfavorably to its source material, opining that it \\"has to be twice as funny a play as it is as a movie\\"; he further explains that \\"deliberate camp like this film presents a special challenge: It must generate and sustain a high level of energy or it will swiftly fall flat. The latter is too often the case here.\\" Praising the \\"strong women\\" of the film, Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle also wrote that Busch (as Monica Stark) \\"captures the woman-alone-in-the-world toughness of the roles played by the stars he loves. It goes beyond camp. He is sincere.\\" However, Graham reasoned that the film has \\"rough edges\\", despite conceding that \\"they probably work to this larky, cheeky picture's advantage\\". He subsequently notes that \\"In some instances, it's hard to tell the really bad acting from the intentionally bad acting.\\" Dennis Lim of The Village Voice was negative, concluding that the film is an \\"awkward combination of garish set decoration and muffled humor\\" and that \\"the viewer is left to ponder the number of levels on which this counts as a pointless exercise‚Äîa parody of parodic movies, a deconstruction of transparent genres, [and] a self-negatingly knowing example of camp\\".

Ewald himself spoke of the sphere of reflection. Ewald's sphere can be used to find the maximum resolution available for a given x-ray wavelength and the unit cell dimensions. It is often simplified to the two-dimensional \\"Ewald's circle\\" model or may be referred to as the Ewald sphere.  Ewald construction  Ewald construction A crystal can be described as a lattice of points of equal symmetry. The requirement for constructive interference in a diffraction experiment means that in momentum or reciprocal space the values of momentum transfer where constructive interference occurs also form a lattice (the reciprocal lattice). For example, the reciprocal lattice of a simple cubic real-space lattice is also a simple cubic structure. Another example, the reciprocal lattice of an FCC crystal real-space lattice is a BCC structure, and vice versa. The aim of the Ewald sphere is to determine which lattice planes (represented by the grid points on the reciprocal lattice) will result in a diffracted signal for a given wavelength, \\\\lambda, of incident radiation. The incident plane wave falling on the crystal has a wave vector K_i whose length is 2\\\\pi/\\\\lambda. The diffracted plane wave has a wave vector K_f. If no energy is gained or lost in the diffraction process (it is elastic) then K_f has the same length as K_i. The difference between the wave-vectors of diffracted and incident wave is defined as scattering vector \\\\Delta{K}=K_f- K_i. Since K_i and K_f have the same length the scattering vector must lie on the surface of a sphere of radius 2\\\\pi/\\\\lambda. This sphere is called the Ewald sphere. The reciprocal lattice points are the values of momentum transfer where the Bragg diffraction condition is satisfied and for diffraction to occur the scattering vector must be equal to a reciprocal lattice vector. Geometrically this means that if the origin of reciprocal space is placed at the tip of K_i then diffraction will occur only for reciprocal lattice points that lie on the surface of the Ewald sphere. Applications =Small scattering-angle limit= When the wavelength of the radiation to be scattered is much smaller than the spacing between atoms, the Ewald sphere radius becomes large compared to the spatial frequency of atomic planes. This is common, for example, in transmission electron microscopy. In this approximation, diffraction patterns in effect illuminate planar slices through the origin of a crystal's reciprocal lattice. However, it is important to note that while the Ewald sphere may be quite flat, a diffraction pattern taken perfectly aligned down a zone axis (high-symmetry direction) contains precisely zero spots that exactly satisfy the Bragg condition. As one tilts a single crystal with respect to the incident beam, diffraction spots wink on and off as the Ewald sphere cuts through one zero order Laue zone (ZOLZ) after another.

Sadam Hussein provoked the United Nations by refusing to live up to his obligations to allow full access to his military sites for inspection. American military units deployed to the region (Operation Desert Thunder), in support of a number of options. Operation Desert Scorpion was a contingency plan that called for a single American division (the 24th Infantry Division), reinforced by some Marine units, to drive from Kuwait north to beyond Basra, cutting Iraq in half and hopefully provoking widespread rebellions. This option was not carried out, as the United Nations Secretary General was able to negotiate a peaceful solution.

The area of operation was mainly in north-central Iraq and was conducted between 15 and 29 June 2003. The stated task and purpose of Operation Desert Scorpion was to defeat remaining enemy non-compliant forces. It was planned as a major operation supporting the first \\"post-hostilities\\" campaign plan which had been issued just a week prior to its inception. Background The operation followed Operation Peninsula Strike, which had ended three days earlier, and was part of a U.S response to a major spike in attacks by anti-coalition forces that began in late May 2003. Operation Peninsula Strike was a 4th Infantry Division operation and was directly influenced by earlier warning orders of Operation Desert Scorpion. This operation was supported from Camp Spearhead Kuwait, by the 149th Transportation Company (POCC), 10th Transportation BN (TML), 7th Transportation GRP (COMP). The operation Combined Joint Task Force 7 conducted the operation that included elements from the 3rd Infantry Division, the 4th Infantry Division, the 101st Airborne Division, 1st Armored Division, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. The scheme of maneuver was first to gain intelligence to identify those elements, or forces, in Iraq that were preventing the establishment of interim governing capability. Simultaneously, the operation was to identify those elements who were supporting governance and stability in Iraq, and identify public works projects that would enable their efforts. The operation was designed to commence with country wide operations that defeated those remaining non - compliant forces while simultaneously providing funds and projects to those areas, and local leaders, who supported the growth of Iraqi governance and stability. The 3rd Infantry Division conducted five raids and detained 20. The 3ID also seized 20 anti- tank rounds, three AK-47s, one Rocket propelled grenade and some C4 explosives along with detonators. The 3ID's humanitarian contributions to the operation included coordinating a trash collection service and removing 64 loads of trash from Fallujah and continued to work with the municipality to re- establish a waste collection system. The 4th Infantry Division conducted 43 raids in an area ranging from Kirkuk in the north to Taji in the south and initially detained 288 individuals. Sixty-five of the detained were held. The unit seized three AK-47s, one mortar site and one Dragunov night sight. The division also placed a contract for playground equipment and a retaining wall for a school in their area, assisted a general hospital with $1,000 drug and supply purchase and purchased an ambulance. Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division conducted three raids and detained 12 individuals. The 101st Airborne Division also worked to rebuild drainage ditches and renovating the Mayor‚Äôs office in Makhmur, along with rebuilding at kindergarten schools. The 1st Armored Division executed offensive actions in Baghdad conducting six raids and detaining 22 individuals. The unit seized nine rifles, eight pistols, three knives, two boxes of grenades, one bomb and three 127mm rounds. The 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment conducted 11 raids and detained 39 individuals. It also passed out school supplies to the local schools in the eastern part of Iraq. Aftermath During the raids, two former Iraqi generals turned themselves in, Maj. Gen. Abdul Ali Jasmin, secretary of the Defense Ministry, and Brig. Gen. Abdullah Ali Jasmin, head of the Iraqi Military Academy and were detained for questioning. Operation Desert Scorpion also resulted in the seizure of eight million Dollars as well as a large sum of British pounds and Euros. In addition to the 1,330 suspects being detained, 497 AK-47s, 235 hand grenades, 124 RPGs, 22 belt-fed machine guns, 130 pistols, 100 rifles, 8,122 rounds and ammunition were also seized.Nance, Malcolm W., The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq Insurgency 2003-2014, CRC Press, 2014 Unfortunately, the operation did not achieve the desired effects. It was hampered initially by a failure to provide for the public works projects so critical to its success. While the Divisions' submitted a total of approximately $53 million in requirements, only some $20 million were funded. Thus, the force did not achieve its aim to publicly demonstrate commitment to rewarding those who supported stability in Iraq. As well, the force did not allow time to develop the intelligence required to find, target and then attack the leaders of local insurgent movements. However, the legacy of Operation Desert Scorpion is still seen today in operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It has become a pattern for operations in both theaters.

When budgeting for a new product, NRE must be considered to analyze if a new product will be profitable. Even though a company will pay for NRE on a project only once, NRE costs can be prohibitively high and the product will need to sell well enough to produce a return on the initial investment. NRE is unlike production costs, which must be paid constantly to maintain production of a product. It is a form of fixed cost in economics terms. Once a system is designed any number of units can be manufactured without increasing NRE cost. NRE can be also formulated and paid via another commercial term called Royalty Fee. The Royalty Fee could be a percentage of sales revenue or profit or combination of these two, which have to be incorporated in a mid to long term agreement between technology supplier and the OEM. In a project-type (manufacturing) company, large parts (possibly all) of the project represent NRE. In this case the NRE costs are likely to be included in the first project's costs, this can also be called research and development (R&D;). If the firm cannot recover these costs, it must consider funding part of these from reserves, possibly take a project loss, in the hope that the investment can be recovered from further profit on future projects. The concept of full product NRE as described above may lead readers to believe that NRE expenses are unnecessarily high. However, focused NRE wherein small amounts of NRE money can yield large returns by making existing product changes is an option to consider as well. A small adjustment to an existing assembly may be considered, in order to use a less expensive or improved subcomponent or to replace a subcomponent which is no longer available. In the world of embedded firmware, NRE may be invested in code development to fix problems or to add features where the costs to implement are a very small percentages of an immediate return. Chrysler found such a way to repair a transmission problem by investing trivial NRE dollars into computer firmware to fix a mechanical problem to save some tens of millions of dollars in mechanical repairs to transmissions in the field.

The body design was by the Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti, and the car was offered in saloon, convertible, coup√©, estate and van models, with the latter marketed as the Triumph Courier. Total Herald sales numbered well over half a million. The Triumph Vitesse, Spitfire and GT6 models are all based on modified Herald chassis and running gear with bolt-together bodies. Herald & Herald S (948 cc) Towards the end of the 1950s Standard-Triumph offered a range of two-seater Triumph sports cars alongside its Standard saloons, the Standard Eight and Standard Ten, powered by a small (803 cc or 948 cc) 4-cylinder engine, which by the late 1950s were due for an update. Standard-Triumph therefore started work on the Herald. The choice of the Herald name suggests that the car was originally intended to be marketed as a Standard, as it fits the model-naming scheme of the time (Ensign, Pennant and Standard itself). But by 1959 it was felt that the Triumph name had more brand equity, and the Standard name was phased out in Britain after 1963. Giovanni Michelotti was commissioned to style the car by the Standard-Triumph board, encouraged by chief engineer Harry Webster, and quickly produced designs for a two-door saloon with a large glass area that gave 93 per cent all-round visibility in the saloon variant and the \\"razor- edge\\" looks to which many makers were turning. As Fisher & Ludlow, Standard- Triumph's body suppliers became part of an uncooperative British Motor Corporation, it was decided that the car should have a separate chassis rather than adopting the newer unitary construction. The main body tub was bolted to the chassis and the whole front end hinged forward to allow access to the engine. Every panel ‚Äì including the sills and roof ‚Äì could be unbolted from the car so that different body styles could be easily built on the same chassis. As an addition to the original coup√© and saloon models, a convertible was introduced in 1960.Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 202 The Standard Pennant's 4-cylinder 948 cc OHV Standard SC engine and 4 speed manual gearbox was used with synchromesh on the top three gears and remote gear shift and driving the rear wheels. Most of the engine parts were previously used in the Standard 8/10. The rack and pinion steering afforded the Herald a tight turning circle. Coil and double-wishbone front suspension was fitted, while the rear suspension, a new departure for Triumph, offered \\"limited\\" independent springing via a single transverse leaf-spring bolted to the top of the final drive unit and swing axles. Instruments were confined to a single large speedometer with fuel gauge in the saloon (a temperature gauge was available as an option) on a dashboard of grey pressed fibreboard. The coup√© dashboard was equipped with speedometer, fuel and temperature gauges, together with a lockable glovebox. The car had loop-pile carpeting and heater as standard. A number of extras were available including twin SU carburettors, leather seats, a wood-veneered dashboard, Telaflo shock absorbers and paint options. In late 1958, prototype cars embarked on a test run from Cape Town to Tangiers. An account of the journey was embellished by PR at the time. However, only minor changes were deemed necessary between the prototype and production cars. The new car was launched at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 22 April 1959 but was not an immediate sales success, partly owing to its relatively high cost, approaching ¬£700 (including 45 per cent Purchase Tax). In standard single-carburettor form the car was no better than average in terms of performance. A saloon tested by The Motor magazine in 1959 was found to have a top speed of and could accelerate from 0‚Äì in 31.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The rear suspension was criticised as yielding poor handling at the extremes of performance though the model was considered easy to drive with its good vision, light steering (smallest turning circle of any production car) and controls, and ease of repair. A Herald S variant was introduced in 1961 with a lower equipment level and less chrome than the Herald. It was offered in saloon form only. The 948 cc Herald Coup√© and Convertible models were discontinued in 1961, the 948 cc Herald Saloon in 1962 and the Herald S in 1964.

This released new resources to develop the Herald and the car was re-launched in April 1961 with an 1147 cc engine as the Herald 1200. The new model featured rubber-covered bumpers, a wooden laminate dashboard and improved seating. Quality control was also tightened up. Twin carburettors were no longer fitted to any of the range as standard although they remained an option, the standard being a single down-draught Solex carburettor. Claimed maximum power of the Herald 1200 was , as against the claimed for the 948 cc model. One month after the release of the Herald 1200, a 3-door estate was added to the range. Disc brakes became an option from 1962. Sales picked up despite growing competition from the Mini and the Ford Anglia. The coup√© was dropped from the range in late 1964 as it was by then in direct competition with the Triumph Spitfire.

The 13/60 was offered in saloon, convertible and estate-bodied versions. The sun-roof remained available for the saloon as an optional extra rather than a standard feature. The front end was restyled using a bonnet similar to the Triumph Vitesse's and the interior substantially revised though still featuring the wooden dashboard.

In this form (though the 1200 saloon was sold alongside it until the end of 1970) the Herald Saloon lasted until December 1970 and the Convertible and Estate until May 1971, by which time, severely outdated in style if not performance, it had already outlived the introduction of the Triumph 1300 Saloon, the car designed to replace it and was still selling reasonably well but, because of its labour-intensive method of construction, selling at a loss.

There is an affectionate portrayal of a Triumph Herald Estate car in the novel 'Room for Us' by Roger Harvey (UK 2020, ). Herald- based cars The Equipe was a car produced by Bond, using the Triumph Herald chassis and components. Having a separate body mounted to a chassis, the Triumph Herald provides a sound basis for a kit car. Examples include: *Sussita 12 ‚Äì (1968‚Äì1970) A car made in Israel, manufactured by Israeli Autocars Company LTD. The Susita 12 station wagon, and sedan (named Carmel), used the Triumph Herald 12/50 engine. *Sussita 13/60 ‚Äì (1970‚Äì1975) An Israeli made car, manufactured by Israeli Autocars Company LTD. Manufactured as 2 doors station wagon, sedan (named Carmel Ducas), and pick-up versions. Built on the Triumph Herald's chassis, and used the Herald 13/60 engine and gearbox. *The \\"T car\\" by New Zealand company Alternative Cars is a MGTF \\"replica\\", which, although not an exact copy of the MGTF, has some of the spirit of the original.

He is most famous for his appearance in Arthurian legend as the uncle of Tristan and husband of Iseult, who engaged with Tristan in a secret liaison, giving Mark the epithet The Cuckold King.Ebenezer Cobham Brewer, Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 1895, p. 315  King Mark  14th century depiction of Mark of Cornwall from the left In Old Welsh records, Mark is recorded as \\"March son of Meirchion\\" and is variously associated with North Wales, South Wales or South- West Scotland. Some identify King Mark with King Conomor of Dumnonia. In Wrmonoc of Land√©vennec's Life of St. Pol de Leon, he refers to a \\"King Marc whose other name is Quonomorus.\\" Also rendered Cunomorus, this name means literally the 'Hound-of-the-sea'.Thomas, Charles (1986) Celtic Britain. London: Thames & Hudson ; p. 70 An inscription on a 6th-century gravestone near the Cornish town of Fowey memorializes (in Latin) a certain \\"Drustanus son of Cunomorus\\" and it has been conjectured that this is the \\"Tristan son of Mark (alias 'Quonomorus')\\" of legend. There is a monument believed by some to refer to Tristan (\\"Drustanus\\") at . The Tristan Stone is a granite pillar near Fowey, Cornwall, originally situated at Castle Dore. The stone has a mid-6th- century two line inscription which has been interpreted as reading DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT CVNOWORI FILIV'S (\\"Drustan lies here, of Cunomorus the son\\"). A now missing third line was described by the 16th century antiquarian John Leland as reading CVM DOMINA OUSILLA (\\"with the lady Ousilla\\"). Ousilla is a Latinisation of the Cornish female name Eselt.Craig Weatherhill, Cornovia: Ancient sites of Cornwall and Scilly 4000 BC ‚Äì 1000 AD. The stone led to Mark's association with Castle Dore. In the legend In most versions of the story of Tristan and Iseult, King Mark of Cornwall is Tristan's uncle. His sister is Tristan's mother, Blancheflor alias Elizabeth/Isabelle, or, in some later versions, he is related to Tristan's father, Meliadus. King Mark and La Belle Iseult by alt= Mark sends Tristan as his proxy to fetch his young bride, the Princess Iseult, from Ireland. Tristan and Iseult fall in love, and, with the help of a magic potion, proceed to have one of the stormiest love affairs in medieval literature. Mark suspects the affair and eventually his suspicions are confirmed. In some versions, he sends for Tristan to be hanged, and banishes Iseult to a leper colony. Tristan escapes the hanging and rescues Iseult from her confinement. Mark later discovers this and eventually forgives them, with Iseult returning to Mark and Tristan leaving the country. The story is cyclical with Mark suspecting Tristan and Iseult of adultery and then believing they were innocent. This happens again and again in the story. In B√©roul's version, Tristan and Iseult are never in grave danger due to the narrator's declaration that he himself and God were on their side. King Mark, in the role of husband, is not portrayed as idealistic as other kings in Arthurian literature who were only portrayed in the role of king and not the personal role of husband. Marie de France's Breton lai Chevrefoil (titled sometimes as The Lay of the Honeysuckle) tells a part of the Tristan and Iseult tale. The lai begins with an explanation that Mark was enraged with Tristan's affair with his wife, and thus banished him from Cornwall. Tristan spends a year in his own land of South Wales, pining away for Isoude. Eventually, his sorrow grew so great that he went against Mark's order and hid in the woods of Cornwall, taking shelter with villagers only at night. Eventually Tristan comes to hear that Mark plans to hold a feast for Pentecost, and that Isoude would be riding through the forest to attend. He finds the path the queen is most likely to take, and lays on it a hazel stick he stripped the bark off of and carved his name into. Isoude recognizes the sign and stops her party to rest, making off surreptitiously with her maid Brangwaine to see Tristan. During this illicit meeting, Isoude helps Tristan with a plan to win back the favor of King Mark. Marie de France ends the poem by telling the reader that the lai Tristan composed was called \\"Goatleaf\\" in English or \\"Ch√®vrefeuille\\" in French, and that the very lai he composed was the one the reader just finished. A 1922 illustration by alt= In the Prose Tristan, Mark's character deteriorates from a sympathetic cuckold to a downright villain. He rapes his niece and then murders her when she produces his son, Meraugis. He murders his brother Baldwin as well. In earlier versions of the story, Tristan dies in Brittany, far away from Mark; but in the Prose Tristan, Mark stabs Tristan while he plays the harp under a tree for Iseult. This version of Mark's character was popular in other medieval works, including the Romance of Palamedes and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In these, Mark is usually seen as ruling Cornwall from Tintagel Castle and is often a sworn enemy of Arthur's jester knight Dinadan and (as in the Post- Vulgate Cycle) even the destroyer of Camelot after the death of Arthur. Horse's ears Mark has become associated with a Celtic variant of the story of Midas and his donkey ears from Greek mythology, due to a pun on marc which is a Celtic word for \\"horse\\". The episode already occurs in Tristan by the 12th century French poet B√©roul, where the dwarf divulges the secret that \\"Mark has horse's ears\\" addressing a hawthorn tree, in the presence of three lords. There is a Breton legend which appeared in print in 1794, in which March was initially the king of Cornouaille, France, seated at Ploumarch (Portzmarch). The king kills every barber who knows the secret about his ears, except one, who speaks the secret into the sand. (or wind). Reeds subsequently grow from that spot, and the plants are harvested to make into reeds for the oboe (or simply make pipes). When the instruments are played, it sounds to the audience as if the music is saying the king has horse's ears.Cambry, F., Voyage dans le Finistere en 1749, II, 287; cited by John Rhys recorded a Welsh tale that differs little from the simpler Breton version. An embellished version collected by (1905) blends the legend of Ys, with the premise that Marc was condemned by Gradlon's daughter (or Dahut). March tried to hunt her when she was assuming the guise of a doe and had his ears exchanged with those of his prized horse Morvarc'h. In modern culture * King Mark takes on a much more gruesome role in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poetry cycle Idylls of the King. While Arthur and many of his knights are away taking on the court of the Red Knight, Lancelot is called upon to judge \\"The Tournament of the Dead Innocence.\\" The tournament quickly becomes a mockery, full of insults and broken rules. Tristram (that is, Tristan) is the winner of the tournament, winning all of the rubies from the necklace. Tristram then breaks tradition in presenting the rubies to a woman present, saying instead \\"This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.\\" This enrages the crowd, with many saying that \\"All courtesy is dead,\\" and \\"The glory of our Round Table is no more.\\" Tristram, who in this piece married Isolt of the White Hands, carries his winnings instead to Mark's wife Queen Isolt, who is upset that Tristram married another woman. The two mock each other for a brief period before Tristram at last puts the necklace about Isolt's neck, and leans down to kiss her. Just as his lips touch her, Mark makes his appearance, rising up behind Tristram and cleaving him through the brain. * Mark (the German \\"Marke\\") is a character in Wagner's 1859 opera Tristan und Isolde, where the role was first performed by the bass Ludwig Zottmayer. * In the 1954 film The Black Knight he is portrayed as a pagan looking to overthrow Christianity and King Arthur by Patrick Troughton. * In the 1970s TV show Arthur of the Britons, Mark was played by Brian Blessed. * In 1981 film Lovespell he was played by Richard Burton (as King Mark of Cornwall). * Mark (called \\"Marc'h of Kernow\\") is a character in Diana L. Paxson's 1988 novel The White Raven. The book consists of Paxson's take on the Tristan and Iseult story, told from the point of view of Iseult's cousin Branwen. * In Bernard Cornwell's 1996 novel Enemy of God in his The Warlord Chronicles series, King Mark is a physically and morally monstrous tyrant who apparently keeps murdering his young wives every few years in order to marry another. When Mark's newest teenage wife Iseult flees with own his young son Tristan, the fugitive lovers take refugee in Mordred's kingdom of Dumnonia under the regency of Tristan's friend Arthur. In an agonizing choice, Arthur allows Mark to arrive with his soldiers and have the prince killed and the queen sadistically burned at the stake. Mark himself later dies from a horrible illness. * In the 2006 film Tristan & Isolde, Marke was played by Rufus Sewell. He adopts Tristan as his son after the death of the boys' parents, who loyally supported Marke's plans to unite Britain's peoples. Marke is portrayed as a good ruler and a kind husband to Isolde, unaware that by circumstance she has already fallen for Tristan, and is confused by his adopted son's unhappy, distanced behaviour. When Tristan and Isolde are caught embracing, Marke feels angry and betrayed, but relents after hearing the full story of their meeting and gives them permission to leave together, though Tristan insists on staying to stand against Marke's mobilising enemies. After Tristan is mortally wounded in battle, Marke takes him back to Isolde to share his last moments with her, then goes on to successfully unite Britain.

It is located close to the border with Wales to which the parish extends towards Monmouthshire. It should not be confused with Newton, a township-chapelry in Clodock Parish and near Longtown, or with Newton Leominister. History The parish of Welsh Newton (which is grouped with the parish of Llanrothal to form Welsh Newton and Llanrothal Group Parish Council) contains two churches: a derelict Methodist chapel and the church of St Mary the Virgin St Mary the Virgin which is also CoE and of Norman architecture, at Welsh Newton (containing an original rood screen). Catholic martyr St John Kemble, executed in 1679, is buried in St Mary's churchyard. There is another Anglican church at Llanrothal. The area contains a lot of history, including Pembridge Castle and at least thirty-one other archaeological sites in Welsh Newton parish alone. The parish also contains a piece of common land, currently registered as unowned under the Commons Act 2006, at Welsh Newton Common; a hill (and hamlet) overlooking the Wye Valley. The village is said to be haunted by several restless spirits, including the headless coachman who has been seen many times on the lane from St Wulstan's Farm to the village. In the first week of December each year, several locals hold a ceremony to still the spirits. This takes place in the ruins of St Faith's Church. According to Kelly's Directory of Herefordshire 1929: :\\"Welsh Newton is a Parish on the Hereford and Monmouth road, three and a half miles north from Monmouth and 8 south west from Ross, in the Southern Division of the county, Wormelow Hundred, Monmouth union and county court district, Harewood End Petty Sessional division, rural deanery of Archenfield and archdeaconry and diocese of Hereford. The Parish extends into Monmouthshire. The church of St. Mary is a plain but ancient building of stone in the Norman style, consisting of chancel, nave, south porch and a small western tower containing 2 bells: the screen is 12th century, lit by a 14th-century dormer window: the roof is 14th century; the stained east window was presented by Mrs. Marriot, in 1879, and there are memorial windows to Mrs. Tylor, of Callow Hill, who died in 1881. The register of baptisms dates from the year 1798; marriages, 1758; burials, 1800. The living is a vicarage, with the rectory of Llanrothal annexed in 1927...in the gift of the Bishop of Hereford. There is a Primitive Methodist Chapel on Welsh Newton Common. Pembridge Castle, built prior to the 13th century, is now a farmhouse. This historic castle was purchased by Dr. Hedley Bartlet, Bishop of Hereford, and partially restored in 1914; It was the home for many years of the priest and martyr Father John Kemble (d. 1679), whose tomb pilgrims visit in the village churchyard; his hand is preserved in a shrine at Hereford. The soil is loamy; subsoil, clay and rock. The chief crops are wheat, barley, oats, turnips and fruit. The area is 1,943 acres (7.9 km¬≤).\\"Kelly's Directory of Herefordshire 1929 (1) Cf Wikipedia: Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 =Notable buildings= Pembridge House is an 18th-century listed former Parsonage house situated in a central position within the village.

His appearances were often distinguished by short, humorous poems he recited during the broadcast, which led to his nickname \\"the poet laureate of television\\". He had one of the leading roles in the film version of The Wiz as the Tin Man. He was a frequent guest on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast series. Early life Julius Russell was born in Atlanta, Georgia. His birthdate and age are unclear; according to one report his birth certificate was lost. At the time of his 2005 death, friends said he was 80, and that was the age reported in his obituaries. That implies a birth year of 1924 or 1925; the New York Times obituary gave his birthdate as October 13, 1924. Federal records suggest that he was born in 1918: Census documents record a Julius Russell in Atlanta aged 1 year 4 months in 1920, consistent with a birthdate in late 1918. The Social Security Death Index lists his birthdate as September 15, 1918. He went to Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta and attended the University of Cincinnati for one semester in 1936,Gail which is also consistent with a birthdate of 1918, as he would have been 18 and not merely 11 or 12, as he would have been if he had been born in 1924 or 1925.

General Harry Taylor, Port of New York, September 13, 1945, p. 233. He got his start as a comedian in the 1940s as a carhop at the Atlanta drive-in The Varsity, where he increased the tips he earned by making customers laugh. He was discovered after he began performing in nightclubs in the 1950s. He subsequently made many \\"party albums\\", which were essentially compilations of his stand-up routines. Early career In 1952, Russell joined with film comedian Mantan Moreland for a stage act, replacing Ben Carter as Moreland's dapper straight man. One of their bits was an old routine that Moreland and Carter had performed in vaudeville and in Charlie Chan films. In the \\"interruption routine\\" (or \\"incomplete sentences\\") Moreland would engage Russell in conversation, only to be interrupted by Russell, who in turn was interrupted by Moreland: > Moreland: Guess who I saw? I saw old‚Äî Russell: Is he back again? I thought > he was‚Äî Moreland: He was, but he got out. Russell: Is that so? Moreland: > Yeah, he was over‚Äî Russell: Is that so? Soon the entire conversation was conducted in incomplete sentences, with each man anticipating or contradicting the other. Their act can be seen in two all- black-cast compilation films, Rhythm and Blues Review and Rock and Roll Revue; another variation of the \\"interruption routine\\", performed by Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover, was featured in Spike Lee's 2000 film Bamboozled. A September 1957 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show led to several guest spots with Jack Paar on The Tonight Show and in 1961 a supporting role as a New York policeman, \\"Andy\\" Anderson, in the sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? Russell returned to the role in the feature-film version of Car 54, Where Are You? (filmed in 1990, released in 1994), with \\"Anderson\\" now serving as the precinct captain. In 1965 Russell became a co-host of ABC's Les Crane Show. In 1970 he was a co-star on the ABC sitcom Barefoot in the Park. From 1973 through 1976 he appeared regularly on The Dean Martin Show and The Dean Martin Comedy World. Scattered appearances on television series followed, as well as occasional guest-host stints on The Tonight Show during the Johnny Carson era. Russell also appeared frequently in Las Vegas, including a series of appearances with Sergio Franchi at the Frontier Hotel in 1978 and 1979,Entertainment in Las Vegas. (September 1, 1978).

Game shows Russell became the first black performer to become a regular panelist on a daily network game show when he joined ABC's Missing Links in 1964. Another ABC show, Rhyme and Reason, had poetry as a premise: > Host: Conny Van Dyke looks like a girl I once dated... Russell: And now, all > my dreams are strictly X-rated! Host: Jack said to Jill when they came down > the hill... Russell: We didn't go there for water‚ÄîI hope you take the pill! > Host: Will sex still be great when I'm ninety-eight... Russell: It might be, > but I won't participate! In 1971 he started as a featured panelist on To Tell the Truth, which led to his being hired for The Match Game when Goodson-Todman Productions revived it two years later. He also served as panelist in 1968 on the syndicated version of What's My Line? Producer Bob Stewart featured him regularly as a panelist on Pyramid throughout its 1970s and 1980s runs. Russell would host two game show pilots: one was Star Words for Mark Goodson in 1983 and a revival of Jackpot for Bob Stewart in 1984. These pilots were shot for CBS, but neither pilot was picked up by the network. Russell went on to host two revivals of Jack Barry and Dan Enright's Juvenile Jury for BET from 1983 to 1984, then again for syndication from 1989 to 1991. In 1985 he hosted the short-lived 1985 NBC game show Your Number's Up, which was produced by Sande Stewart. During his appearances on game shows, at some point in the broadcast the host would give the floor to Russell, who would recite a self-penned poem from memory, looking straight into the camera. These poems from game show appearances are typical of his style and wit: > What is the secret of eternal youth? The answer is easily told; All you > gotta do if you wanna look young Is hang out with people who are old. George > Washington threw a silver dollar Across the Potomac one day, And ever since > then, politicians in Washington Have been throwing our money away! The > opposite of pro is con. That fact is clearly seen. If progress means moving > forward, Then what does Congress mean? If you ever go out with a > schoolteacher, You're in for a sensational night; She'll make you do it over > and over again Until you do it right. The young people are very different > today; And there's one sure way to know; Kids used to ask where they came > from; Now they'll tell you where you can go! If a baby slept in a water bed, > It would be pretty grim; You wouldn't know if he was wetting the bed, Or the > bed was wetting him. Spanking a child to get him to learn Is something I > cannot defend, How can you knock any sense in his head When you're whacking > him on the wrong end? He was a trained dancer, influenced in his youth by Jack Wiggins. Russell put these talents to use in the 1978 musical The Wiz as the Tin Man. He also appeared on the big screen in 1994's adaptation of Car 54, Where Are You?, reprising his role as Anderson, now promoted from sergeant to captain. Later career and death During the 1990s Russell gained popularity with a new generation of television viewers as a regular on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Russell often appeared during comedy sketches between scheduled guests and delivered his trademark rhymes. Russell's final TV appearance was as a panelist on a game show‚Äìthemed week on the final season of the Tom Bergeron version of Hollywood Squares in 2003. Russell died in 2005 at age 87 in New York City, after suffering from cancer. He was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Atlantic Ocean.

He has two older sisters: Meg Busch, who used to be a producer of promotional spots for Showtime, and Betsy Busch, a textile designer. Busch's aunt, Lillian Blum, his mother's oldest sister and a former teacher, brought him to live in Manhattan after the death of his mother. She told an interviewer: \\"He was so shy it was almost pathological. ... Before he moved in with me, I would pick him up in Hartsdale on a Friday afternoon, and he would be like a zombie. But the minute we crossed the river to New York he was absolutely a new boy.\\" Busch was intensely interested in films as a young child, especially those with female leads from the 30s and 40s. Blum insisted that Busch read the front page of the newspaper every day to help him keep at least one foot in the real world. Busch attended The High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. He majored in drama at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois and received his B.A. in 1976. While at the university, Busch had difficulty being cast in plays and began to write his own material, such as a play called Sister Act about siamese twin showgirls, which succeeded in drawing interest on campus. =Early theatre years= Busch has usually played the leading lady in drag in his plays. He has said, \\"Drag is being more, more than you can be. When I first started drag I wasn't this shy young man but a powerful woman. It liberated within me a whole vocabulary of expression. It was less a political statement than an aesthetic one.\\" His camp style shows simultaneously send up and celebrate classic film genres. Busch has said, however, \\"I'm not sure what [campy] means, but I guess if my plays have elements of old movies and old fashioned plays, and I'm this bigger-than-life star lady, that's certainly campy. I guess what I rebelled against was the notion that campy means something is so tacky or bad that it's good, and that I just didn't relate to.\\" Busch \\"toured the country in a non-drag one-man show he wrote called 'Alone With a Cast of Thousands.'\\" from 1978‚Äì84. By 1984, Busch's performance bookings grew slim. He held various odd jobs, such as temporary office assistant, apartment cleaner, portrait artist \\"at bar mitzvahs\\", phone salesperson, shop manager, ice cream server, sports handicapper and artists' model. He thought that perhaps his last piece would be a skit put on in the Limbo Lounge, a performance space and gallery in the East Village in Manhattan. The skit was a hit and became Vampire Lesbians of Sodom (1984). When it was revived the next year at the Provincetown Playhouse, The New York Times described it as having \\"costumes flashier than pinball machines, outrageous lines, awful puns, sinister innocence, harmless depravity. ... the female roles [Busch] creates are hilarious vamps, but also high comic characters ... the audience laughs at the first line and goes right on laughing at every line to the end\\".Bruckner, D. J. R. \\"Stage: Vampire Lesbians of Sodom\\", The New York Times, June 20, 1985; accessed November 25, 2011. Busch and his collaborators soon created a series of shows, mostly at the Limbo Lounge, such as Theodora, She-Bitch of Byzantium (1984) and Times Square Angel (1985, Provincetown Playhouse). The company called itself \\"Theatre in Limbo\\" and attracted a loyal gay following. Other early plays include Pardon My Inquisition, or Kiss the Blood Off My Castanets (1986), in which Busch \\"played both Maria Garbanza, a prostitute, and her look-alike, the elegant Marquesa del Drago.\\"\\"Charles Busch, 'Pardon My Inquisition, or Kiss the Blood Off My Castanets' Listing\\" , doollee.com; accessed January 8, 2012Bennetts, Leslie.

He rewrote the book for the musical Ankles Aweigh for a 1988 production staged by the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut. The New York Times reviewer noted that \\"Here and there, one sees unmistakable traces of Mr. Busch's touch. In a funny series of appearances, for example, the actor Frank Siano assumes multiple roles, among them a mugging tenor, a spaced-out priest and, in drag, the mother of the musical's leading ladies. And some silly puns and what could be called off- color sight gags bear Mr. Busch's offbeat imprint.\\"Klein, Alvin. \\"Ankles Aweigh Gets Goodspeed Revamping\\", The New York Times (abstract), September 11, 1988, Section 12CN, p. 13 Busch has been a member of the Writers Guild of America since 1989. His Charles Busch Revue was produced at the Ballroom Theatre in May 1993 in New York. The New York Times reviewer wrote \\"To the melodramatic strains of 'Town Without Pity,' Mr. Busch impersonates a slithery teen-age tramp, glued into a skin-tight red vinyl dress, who is accidentally killed while being fought over by two leather-jacketed youths. As in his plays like Vampire Lesbians of Sodom and The Lady in Question, the skit illustrates Mr. Busch's skill at taking pop kitsch and using drag to give it several extra jolts of silliness. Among New York's drag performers, he is certainly the most congenial.\\" The reviewer concluded that \\"even when the material is less than scintillating, the show ... remains consistently charming and ebullient.\\"Holden, Stephen. \\"Reviews.The Charles Busch Revue\\" , The New York Times (from charlesbusch.com; \\"Review/Cabaret;Charles Busch on Drag and 'Dragnet'\\" ‚Äì exact New York Times title\\"), May 22, 1993, Section 1, p. 13 Also in 1993, he performed in a revival of Jean Genet's The Maids at the Off- Broadway Classic Stage Company in the role of Solange.\\"The Maids , lortel.org; accessed January 8, 2012.Brantley, Ben. \\"Review/Theater; Drag Star Tries On a More Serious Context\\", The New York Times (abstract), September 30, 1993 In 1993, he wrote a novel, Whores of Lost Atlantis, a fictionalized re-telling of the creation of Vampire Lesbians of Sodom.Busch, Charles. Whores of Lost Atlantis, Hyperion (1993) The Green Heart was adapted by Busch from a short story by Jack Ritchie into a musical which was produced by the Manhattan Theater Club at the Variety Arts Theatre in New York City, opening in April 1997. The New York Times review by Ben Brantley noted \\"This patchy contemporary fable of greed and romance, with a book by Charles Busch and songs by Rusty Magee, almost never takes off except when its villainesses take over. ... while Mr. Busch's book is plump with funny lines, Mr. Magee's lyrics are often flat or laborious. The concepts behind the songs are often inspired.\\"Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review.How Cold Villainy Adds Warmth\\", The New York Times, April 11, 1997. He took the male lead in his comedy, You Should Be So Lucky which opened at Primary Stages Company, New York City, in November 1994. Ben Brantley, in his The New York Times review, wrote that \\"Christopher is portrayed by the play's author, Charles Busch, a fabled drag performer who has hitherto seldom set foot on a New York stage without a glitzy dress and heels high enough to induce vertigo. Here, wearing pants, a mandarin-collar shirt and no discernible mascara or lipstick, Mr. Busch does indeed seem incomplete. He walks with a sad-sack slump, and when he talks, in a small, self-conscious voice, he ducks his head. Christopher is clearly an unfinished soul who hasn't yet found his part in life, and, as he observes forlornly, 'I'm not unique: there are thousands of us living in peculiar circumstances all over the Village.'... 'You Should Be So Lucky'...is a very funny, exceptionally generous-spirited work that's all about dotting the \\"i\\" in personality.\\"Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review.Charles Busch Takes On a Trouser Role\\", The New York Times, November 3, 1994. Other works of the 1990s include Swingtime Canteen, produced at the Blue Angel, New York City, in August 1995. The New York Times reviewer wrote that \\"As the moment demands, Mr. Busch as the grande dame preens, minces, sashays, bats eyes, tosses off the most winningly treacly of smiles, and with reckless abandon drops names of dear, dear friends (Joan Crawford, Loretta Young, Jeanette MacDonald, Cole Porter). He has a way with songs like 'You'll Never Know' and lines like 'We're in a war, ladies, and we've got to win.' \\"Van Gelder, Lawrence. \\"Theater Review; Charles Busch Replaces Female Lead\\", The New York Times, August 25, 1995 His one-man show, Flipping My Wig ran at the WPA Theater, New York City, starting in December 1996. Ben Brantley, in his review for The New York Times, wrote that the story is \\"the sordid but uplifting personal history of a not-so-very-wicked stepmother who only wanted to do right by her family and get a little glamour out of life. ... Many professional drag queens are, however, only impersonators. Mr. Busch is indeed an illusionist and of a particularly affecting stripe. Here, in his assorted incarnations -- from a tough but good-hearted nightclub chanteuse of the Prohibition era to a suburban housewife who becomes Edith Piaf for an evening -- he provides a living bridge between manufactured images of womanhood and the fantasies they inspire. Mr. Busch, a popular crossover cross-dresser since his first hit spoof, Vampire Lesbians of Sodom, a decade ago, holds a special place in the world of drag. Walking a delicate line between adulation and ridicule, he avoids both the polemics and the pathos of most men who play women.\\"Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review.Between a Female Image and Fantasy\\", The New York Times, December 20, 1996. He wrote Queen Amarantha, which played at the WPA Theatre, starting in October 1997; Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote that it examined \\"sexual identity to new levels of intricacy and earnestness.\\"Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review.Charles Busch Plays It Straight, So to Speak\\", The New York Times, October 24, 1997.

Die! is Charles Busch's funniest, most accomplished and, without question, raunchiest work ... And that doesn't even begin to do justice to his parade of wigs and pumps which, as always, he wears with considerable grace and understatement.\\" Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times called the show \\"an excuse to see a peerless performer in action\\".

Variety. Feb. 9, 2014 In March 2019, Busch will star as Lucille Ball in \\"I Loved Lucy\\" by playwright Lee Tannen at the Bridge Street Theatre in Catskill, NY. Performance style and influences Busch's style is based on movie star acting rather than naturalistic femininity. Busch later said that he was described as \\"too thin, too light, which is the euphemism for gay. I was never cast at Northwestern for basically these reasons, and finally, I thought maybe what's most disturbing about me is what is most unique: my theatrical sense, my androgyny, even identifying with old movie actresses\\". He specializes in femmes fatales. \\"I'm an actor playing a role, but it's drag. A lot of drag can be very offensive, but I like to think that in some crazy way the women I play are feminist heroines.\\" Busch said, \\"I've always played a duality. I guess I've always felt a duality in myself: elegance and vulgarity. There's humor in that. I've always found that fun on stage, as well. It's not enough for me to be the whore. I have to be the whore with pretensions or the great lady with a vulgar streak. It's the duality that I find interesting.\\" Busch generally writes without a political agenda, and he predominantly portrays characters who are white, middle class, gay, and between 20 and 40 years old. Busch was inspired by Charles Ludlam, an avant-garde performer and playwright who founded The Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1967 and wrote, directed, and acted in the company's exaggerated, absurdist camp productions. Busch presented his one-man show Hollywood Confidential in a theater owned by The Ridiculous Theatrical Company in July 1978 at One Sheridan Square, New York. He also appeared for several performances in the company's production of Bluebeard as Hecate, also in July 1978. Busch said of this experience: \\"If I had ever entertained a fantasy of working with the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, doing Hecate got it out of my system.\\"Kaufman, David. \\"Charles Busch\\", Ridiculous!: the theatrical life and times of Charles Ludlam (2005), Hal Leonard Corporation, , pp. 284‚Äì85 Busch has said that he was also inspired by seeing Joan Sutherland and Zoe Caldwell perform when he was a child. Busch recalled: \\"When I was about 13 years old, around 1968 or '69, I went to see Zoe Caldwell in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. I was so dazzled that I don't think I've ever recovered.\\" In 1991, Busch was performing in his play Red Scare on Sunset. He said that he had difficulty connecting with the audience at one of the performances. Caldwell went backstage after the performance to give him some advice: \\"'You are so beautiful. But you were pushing too hard. You're much better than that.' ...It's the best lesson I've learned from a famous person.\\" During his run in The Tribute Artist, Busch revealed that he also found inspiration in drag performers Charles Pierce and Mr. Lynne Carter.Five Burning Questions with the One and Only Charles Busch Awards and nominations Busch received the Charlie Local and National Comedy Award from the Association of Comedy Artists in 1985 for \\"special contributions to the art of comedy.\\" He also received the Manhattan Academy of Cabaret Award in 1985 and 1993.Rooney, Terry, editor.

Built as a civilian passenger liner in 1939 by De Schelde at Vlissingen, she was named the MS Koningin Emma, after Queen Emma of the Netherlands, and operated by Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ) (The Zealand Steamship Company) between Flushing and Harwich, along with her sister ship, MS Prinses Beatrix. After fleeing to Britain after the German invasion in 1940, she was requisitioned by the British Ministry of War Transport, renamed HMS Queen Emma and converted to a troopship at Harland and Wolff's yard in Belfast. During the war her main role was transporting British Commandos, and she participated in the Lofoten Islands Raid and the Dieppe Raid. She had the advantage of a high speed that allowed hit and run operations. Later designated as a Landing Ship, Infantry (Medium) she took part in the landings in North Africa, Sicily and Normandy. She operated in the Indian Ocean, and in the Dutch East Indies after the end of the war. In 1946 Queen Emma was returned to her owners and continued to operate as ferry from the Hook of Holland until 1969, when she was scrapped in Antwerp, Belgium. Construction The MS Koningin Emma was ordered by the Zeeland Steamship Company (SMZ) in December 1937 to operate between Vlissingen (Flushing) and Harwich. The keel was laid on 7 May 1938 at the De Schelde shipyard at Vlissingen, and the ship was launched on 14 January 1939 by Queen Wilhelmina. However the Emma stuck on the slipway and it took more than four hours to free her. During sea trials Koningin Emma made more than which was more than was contractually agreed. On 19 May 1939 the ship was handed over to the SMZ. It had a gross tonnage of 4,135 tons and was capable of carrying 1,800 passengers. Propulsion was provided by two 2-stroke Sulzer diesel engines with a total output of 12,500 shp. Service history Koningin Emma entered service on 4 June 1939, but after the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, was withdrawn, and remained in port. On 10 May 1940 the Germans launched their invasion of the Netherlands, dropping mines in the Schelde estuary, and bombing and strafing shipping. Koningin Emma promptly fled, arriving at London on 15 May. =Troop transport= Two days later the British Ministry of War Transport chartered her as a troop transport. She was fitted with \\"degaussing\\" coils as protection against German magnetic mines and sailed with her original civilian crew on board in addition to a Dutch Marine detachment. The ship was ordered to take French troops evacuated to England from Dunkirk back to Brest to continue the fight. She left Plymouth on 2 June and sailed with 1,712 aboard, accompanied by the French corvette Commandant Rivi√®re. They returned the next day, then sailed once more with approximately 1,500 men on board, returning with British troops. On 16 June Koningin Emma, made her last voyage to Brest. By now the Germans had occupied most of northern France, so she was ordered to Bayonne on 20 June where 1,482 evacuees were boarded. Koningin Emma then took part in the British occupation of Iceland, landing troops and equipment. In September 1940 Koningin Emma was formally taken over by the Admiralty to be converted into an \\"assault ship\\" at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. The upper deck was largely cleared and gravity davits installed enabling six LCAs and two LCM(1)s to be carried, along with 450 troops. Koningin Emma was armed with two 12-pounder guns, two 2-pounders, four Hotchkiss 20 mm machine guns, and four .303 cal. machine guns. The ship was commissioned as HMS Queen Emma on 22 January 1941 as a special service ship. =Lofoten Raid= Her first major action in her new role was Operation Claymore, a raid on the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway. On 22 February 1941 Queen Emma arrived at Scapa Flow, where men of 4 Commando boarded, as well as Royal Engineer demolition experts and a contingent of Norwegian troops. The British ships ‚Äì five destroyers and two troop ships ‚Äì entered the Vestfjord on the morning of 4 March, and launched their attack. Surprise was complete and there was little resistance. All targets selected were located and destroyed. The troops were embarked by 13.00 hours and within half an hour the British had left. After returning to England Queen Emma was used for the training and exercise of Special Forces in Scotland. =South Atlantic= In late 1941 she was selected to join the forces gathered at Freetown, Sierra Leone, for Operation Pilgrim, the planned occupation of the Canary Islands, if either the Spanish or the Germans captured Gibraltar. After maintenance at Glasgow Queen Emma sailed to Freetown, arriving on 5 October 1941. However, it soon became clear that Franco did not plan to join the Axis, nor was he prepared to allow the German troops free passage through Spain to attack Gibraltar, and the operation was cancelled. On 4 November 1941 the British navy tanker reported that she had been attacked by a German raider, between Natal, Brazil and Freetown. Queen Emma was one of the ships sent to search. No German raider was found and the Admiralty assumed that a German U-boat had shot at the tanker. However, on 22 November the was sunk by the British cruiser in the southern Atlantic close to Ascension Island, and on 1 December the cruiser sank the German supply ship Python in the same area. Almost all the crews from both ships were taken aboard German and Italian submarines. The British feared that the Germans would try to land on Ascension and overwhelm the tiny garrison. Queen Emma was hurriedly loaded with troops and set sail. However, while en route it was learned that the German crewmen were on their way to Bordeaux and the ship was recalled. On 14 February 1942 Queen Emma left Freetown, and returned to England for refitting, after which she was reclassified as a Landing Ship, Infantry (Medium). =Dieppe Raid= In April 1942 Queen Emma was selected to take part in a raid on the French coast at Dieppe. On the evening of 18 August 1942 a fleet of more than 200 ships sailed across the Channel. Queen Emma and the former Belgian ship Princess Astrid landed men of the Royal Regiment of Canada on \\"Blue Beach\\" to the east of Dieppe at Puys. However, the raid was not a success, and the losses were high. =Invasion of North Africa= Queen Emma was then assigned to Training Squadron D based on the Clyde, carrying out exercises with Special Forces and practising the landing of ground troops on enemy beaches. All these exercises were in preparation for the landings in North Africa, Operation Torch. On 26 October 1942 Queen Emma received troops from the 1st Battalion of the U.S. 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, then joined Convoy KMF-1 for North Africa, landing her troops west of Oran. =The Moonlight Squadron= Queen Emma remained in the western Mediterranean, supplying and transporting reinforcements for the First Army. On the evening of Friday, 13 November 1942, Queen Emma left Algiers with units of the British 78th Infantry Division for B√¥ne, close to the front line. On the return trip to Algiers she was repeatedly attacked by German aircraft, but made port without damage. Queen Emma, her sister ship Princess Beatrix, and the former Burn & Laird Lines ships and became known as the \\"Moonlight Squadron\\" for their preference for operating at night. After the fall of Tunis in May 1943 the ships received a special commendation from the Allied Army Commanders and a letter from the British Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the commander in chief of the western Mediterranean. =Invasion of Sicily= Queen Emma was then attached to the ships of Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. The British sector was greatly hampered by severe German air attacks, and on 17 July 1943 the Queen Emma was hit, with 18 killed and 70 wounded. The ship sailed to Malta for repairs. Her speed had been reduced to , so she was downgraded to troop transport vessel. After the Italian capitulation on 8 September 1943 she escorted units of the Italian fleet to Malta, and soon afterwards sailed back to England for a complete overhaul. =Invasion of France= Queen Emma then began landing exercises in preparation for Operation Overlord, the invasion of France. On 6 June 1944 Queen Emma sailed with Canadian troops to Normandy. The ship was part of the transport group of the Eastern Naval Task Force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Chandler. In the weeks after D-Day Queen Emma completed numerous voyages between England and the French coast, carrying men of the U.S. 8th Air Force, and a number of British Guards Divisions, as well as units of the English ATS and Wrens, despite the danger of German coastal batteries, E-boats and midget submarines. At the end of 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge Queen Emma helped transport the British 6th Airborne Division from England to France as reinforcements. It would be her last European mission. She had crossed the North Sea 43 times, sailing approximately 20,000 miles and had transported 30,000 Allied troops. =Indian Ocean= Queen Emma was decommissioned to be adapted for service in tropical waters at Harland & Wolff at Belfast. The works were completed on 29 March 1945, and on 5 May Queen Emma sailed with Convoy KMF-44 for India, arriving at Bombay on the 26th. Queen Emma remained in India until the Japanese surrender in August. She then took part in Operation Jurist ‚Äì the reoccupation of Penang by British Marines. She then embarked French troops, and escorted by the , sailed to Saigon. On the return trip, Queen Emma was damaged by an acoustic mine. Her main engines were knocked out and the ship had to be towed. However, emergency repairs were made and she reached Singapore under her own power. After this Queen Emma transported Dutch women and children from Japanese concentration camps, and took British troops to Batavia, Semarang and Soerabaja. =Return to the Netherlands= In January 1946 the ship was ordered to return to England, arriving at Portsmouth on 6 March 1946. The landing craft, weapons, and other military equipment was removed and on 29 April 1946 the Queen Emma arrived back in her home port of Vlissingen after an absence of six years to be handed back to the Dutch Government. The ship was officially returned to SMZ in early March 1946 and resumed her original name MS Koningin Emma. Post-war shortages of materials and labour meant that it was 5 March 1948 before Koningin Emma could return to service, sailing for the first time to Harwich from the Hook of Holland. She remained in service on the same route until 1968, when she was replaced by a new generation of roll-on/roll-off ships. The thirty-year-old Koningin Emma was taken out of service and sold for scrap just before the year's end in Antwerp.

The population was 222 as of the 2010 census, down from 250 reported as of 2000 by Mono County.Mono County populations At the previous census (1990) the town population was 398, and at the census before that (1980) it was 315. Economy The economy of Lee Vining relies largely on tourism, since it is the closest town to the east entrance of Yosemite National Park, and is near other tourist destinations such as Mono Lake, the ghost town of Bodie, popular trout fishing destinations, and June Mountain and Mammoth Mountain ski areas and the June Lake recreational area. Although off-season tourism has increased in recent years, most tourists visit in the summer months because State Route 120 through Yosemite is often closed otherwise due to heavy snowfall in the winter. Lee Vining has a year-round Information Center for visitors. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 5.2 square miles (13.5 km2), 99.95% of it land, and 0.05% of it water. =Climate= Lee Vining, on the boundary between the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin ecoregions, has a transitional climate warmer and drier than the mountains to the west but cooler and much snowier than the vast desert to the east. Despite only getting 14 inches of water-equivalent precipitation annually, the town averages nearly six feet of snow, sometimes falling as late as April or even May. Precipitation is highest in the winter months of December through March, but some can be expected to fall every month of the year and the town does not typically experience the four to six month dry spells of more coastal parts of California. History The town was named after Leroy Vining, who founded the town in 1852 as a mining camp. In 1926, the town was laid out by Chris Mattly and named \\"Lakeview\\", but when a post office was sought in 1928, it was learned that another town, Lakeview, California already had the name. The name of Lee Vining was chosen in 1953. The place was also called Poverty Flat for its unfavorable conditions for agriculture. Sights The town is the site of the Upside-Down House, a distinctive local landmark built by silent film actress Nellie Bly O'Bryan. Also located in the town is the Whoa Nellie Deli, which was once described by the San Francisco Chronicle as \\"a misplaced Fellini set carved into the edge of the Mono Basin, dust devils skipping around in the distance like extras on the floor of Owens Valley.\\" The town is home to the Mono Cone burger and ice- cream store, open in the spring and summer. Gus Hess Park commemorates an early miner in Lee Vining. Lee Vining is situated near the foot of Lee Vining Canyon. State Route 120 runs from town, through the canyon, up to Tioga Pass.

He was born in Brunswick and educated at G√∂ttingen. He came to England at the end of 1800 to organize the collections of Queen Charlotte. On the completion of this work he became assistant to Dryander, librarian to Joseph Banks. In 1807, he succeeded George Shaw as assistant keeper of the department of natural history in the British Museum. On the death of his superior in 1813, he took his place as keeper. He later became keeper of geology and mineralogy, and turned his attention to minerals and fossils, arranging the recently acquired collection of Mr. Greville. He retained the post until his sudden death in London in 1851. Konig anglicized his name upon his appointment as assistant keeper in 1807. In 1837, following a House of Commons Select committee report on the British Museum, the Department of Natural History was divided into three branches, with Konig being put in charge of the Mineralogical and Geological branch. Besides writing various papers for journals, Konig was associated with John Sims in the issue of Annals of Botany from 1805 to 1807. He described many fossils in the British Museum in a classic work entitled Icones fossilium sectiles (1820‚Äì1825).

Career =Club= He began his playing career for the W≈Ç√≥kniarz Pabianice team in 1965, but later left the club in 1973. =National team= From 1976 to 1984, he won 53 international caps for Poland. Janas played at centre-back in all seven of Poland's games at the 1982 World Cup in Spain where the team achieved an unexpected third place. Manager career Janas' coaching career started as an assistant at Legia Warszawa in 1988. He later ended his work at Legia Warszawa in 1990, and took up a post helping W≈Çadys≈Çaw Stachurski lead the Polish youth squad. He was assistant to Janusz W√≥jcik at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona where Poland won the silver medal. In the same year he again became W√≥jcik's assistant, this time at Legia. From 1994 to 1996, Janas was the head coach at Legia where he and his team won the Championship (1994, 1995), Polish Cup (1994, 1995), Polish Supercup (1994), as well as advanced to the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions' Cup (1995‚Äì96 season). From 1996 to 1999, Janas coached the Polish youth/Olympic squad, which advanced to the quarter finals of the European Championships. From 1999 he worked as the manager and vice- president of sport at Amica Wronki until 2002. On 20 December 2002, he officially took charge of the Polish national team. He was heavily criticized in the beginning of his national team spell, despite achieving good results. Nonetheless, under Janas the Poland team qualified for the 2006 World Cup, finishing second in a qualifying group behind England. They qualified as the best second placed team, scoring 27 goals in the qualifiers, 10 more than the group leaders England. In the final tournament, Poland were drawn with Ecuador, hosts Germany and Costa Rica. Their first game, against Ecuador in Gelsenkirchen, ended in a disappointing 2‚Äì0 defeat, and Janas received criticism from the Polish press for his team selection and tactics, which involved leaving striker Maciej Zurawski alone and unsupported up front. He played a 4‚Äì5‚Äì1 formation, which he said \\"safety first\\". Poland played well with 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 in the qualifiers, which resulted in flowing football. Poland played much better in their second game, against the Germans in Dortmund, but again lost, this time 1‚Äì0 to a late goal by Oliver Neuville, despite a magnificent performance by their goalkeeper Artur Boruc. This meant that the third match, against Costa Rica in Hamburg, was meaningless; Poland won 2‚Äì1 with two goals by defender Bartosz Bosacki. Janas was sacked from his post by the Polish FA after the tournament. In 2008, he became manager of Ekstraklasa side GKS Be≈Çchat√≥w, leading them to a 5th place standing at the half-way point of the 2008‚Äì09 season but resigned during the winter break, citing lack of squad depth which would not allow the team to challenge for a higher position. In January 2009, he accepted the managerial position at Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In June, the club won the second division but was not allowed to advance by the PZPN. After winning the title again in 2010, Janas decided to leave the club in June. In September, he became a manager at Polonia Warszawa. In August 2013, he was appointed as manager at Bytovia Byt√≥w. On 24 May 2014 his club was promoted to Polish I liga.

Biography The band was formed, originally under the name of Lucifer, and was initially composed of guitarist and vocalist Kevin Heybourne, guitarist Rob Downing, drummer Steve Jones, and bassist Barry Clements. Lucifer split and Steve Jones joined up with Bruce Dickinson to form Speed. The remnants of Lucifer became Angel Witch, with the exceptions of Barry, who was replaced by Kevin Riddles, and Steve Jones, who was replaced by Dave Hogg. The following year Rob Downing left the band. Angel Witch's first song to achieve mainstream popularity was \\"Baphomet\\", which was included on a compilation titled Metal for Muthas. This song drew a fair amount of attention to the band, and they eventually signed a recording deal with EMI. However, the deal was soon canceled, due to manager Ken Heybourne refusing to hand Angel Witch over to professional management, and performance of their first single released under the EMI label in 1980, which was entitled Sweet Danger and lasted a single week on British top charts. This was their only UK chart listing and despite being quite an achievement for a NWOBHM group, spending a single week at No. 75 (the lowest position in the charts) meant they were listed as the 'least successful chart act of all time' in the Guinness book of records. This same feat was repeated by fellow NWOBHM group Grand Prix with their Keep On Believing 7\\" in 1983. In 1980, Bronze Records picked up the band and they soon proceeded to record and release their debut album, self-titled Angel Witch. This album is considered one of the most notable from the new wave of British heavy metal, but subsequent to the album's release, the band's structure began to fall apart. The sacking of Dave Hogg, and Kevin Riddles leaving the band to join Tytan, and despite Heybourne's attempts to continue Angel Witch with other musicians, the end of the band was declared and he joined Deep Machine. Angel Witch was brought back to activity on 1982, when Heybourne and two musicians from Deep Machine - namely vocalist Roger Marsden and drummer Ricky Bruce - left to assemble a new Angel Witch line-up together with bassist Jerry Cunningham. This line-up lasted a very short time, as Marsden's voice did not fit the style of the band very well. He was fired from the band and Heybourne assumed the vocals once more. By 1983 the band had ceased its activities, and Heybourne moved to Blind Fury. In 1984, Angel Witch was once more brought to life, this time with the help of bassist Peter Gordelier (ex-Marquis De Sade), singer Dave Tattum and with Dave Hogg returning to the drums. This line-up recorded the album Screamin' N' Bleedin'. Dave Hogg was sacked yet again, but not without many snide remarks from the band's fans. He was replaced by Spencer Hollman. With the new drummer they recorded Frontal Assault, which deviated heavily from Angel Witch's previous albums, having many melodic elements. Dave Tattum was sacked the same year and for a few years Angel Witch played as a trio on sporadic live performances. In 1989, they recorded a new live album, entitled simply Live. Heybourne decided that it would be of the band's best interest to move to the United States, but the other members had no way of accomplishing that, having stable lives on their home country. Thus, an American incarnation of Angel Witch was born. It was composed of Heybourne, bassist Jon Torres (L»ß»ßz Rockit, Ulysses Siren), drummer Tom Hunting (Exodus) and guitarist Doug Piercy (Heathen, Anvil Chorus). This line-up functioned quite well, and soon the band had booked a fair number of shows throughout the US. However, it was found that Heybourne had some pending issues regarding immigration, and he was arrested one day before the first concert of the band. Without Heybourne, Angel Witch was soon dissolved. After the release of the Resurrection compilation in 2000, the band intended to play together once more, but after a series of internal conflicts, Heybourne assembled yet another line-up, with new members. They were on the bill for the traditional Orange Goblin Christmas show at The Camden Underworld, London, on Saturday 20 December 2008. In 2009 their eponymous song \\"Angel Witch\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the action-adventure videogame, Br√ºtal Legend. In 2011 Angel Witch entered in the studio to record their fourth full-length studio album, entitled \\"As Above, So Below\\". It was recorded with Kevin Heybourne on guitar and vocals, Will Palmer on the bass guitar, Bill Steer on the guitar, and Andrew Prestidge on the drums. They also returned to playing live, with a second stage headline slot at Bloodstock Open Air in 2011. One-time Angel Witch bassist Jon Torres died on 3 September 2013 of a reported heart failure. He was 51 years old. The band continues to tour and play festivals. On 30 August 2019, the band released a new single, 'Don't Turn Your Back', which subsequently debuted at number 17 on the Kerrang! Rock Chart before rising to 14 in its second and final week.Kerrang! Rock Chart, Kerrang!, 4 September 2019, page 15. Legacy Angel Witch have been claimed as an influence by many notable metal musicians, including Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) who graced the February 2010 cover of Decibel magazine wearing an Angel Witch shirt, Tom G. Warrior (Celtic Frost), and Chuck Schuldiner (Death). Bands that have covered Angel Witch songs in concert or on record include Trouble (\\"Confused\\" live), Six Feet Under (\\"Confused\\" on Graveyard Classics), Blood Curse (\\"Angel Witch\\" on their debut album \\"Sorceress\\"), Onslaught (\\"Confused\\" on In Search of Sanity), Skull Fist (\\"Angel Witch\\" live), Battle Ram (\\"Angel Witch\\" on the Smash the Gates EP), S.A.Slayer (\\"Dr. Phibes\\" & \\"Angel Witch\\" live) and Exodus (\\"Angel of Death\\" on Blood In, Blood Out as bonus track), Amazing Maze, which is a one off album by Italian Power Metal band Labyrinth under a different name (\\"Angel Witch\\"). In 2007, German label Unbroken Records issued a Tribute to Angel Witch compilation album featuring 15 underground metal acts covering songs from the band's early singles and first three full-length releases.

It is awarded to persons who make contributions of statewide significance. An auxiliary honor is \\"The Order of the Silver Crescent.\\" Today it is awarded to persons who make community or professional contributions of local significance. History Governor John West created the Order of the Palmetto in 1971 to recognize lifetime achievement and service. It was modeled on similar honors bestowed in other states, such as the Kentucky Colonel and North Carolina's Order of the Longleaf Pine. The presentation is made in the form of a framed plaque. Over the years, the governors have awarded the honor to South Carolina leaders with a connection to the serving gubernatorial administration. The honor program has been modified. In 1997 Governor David Beasley established \\"The Order of the Silver Crescent\\" to recognize contributions by persons younger than 18. In 1999 Governor Jim Hodges created a non-partisan screening panel to review nominations. The eligibility criteria for the \\"Silver Crescent\\" was changed to make it an auxiliary award, to be made without restrictions of age. In 2003, Governor Mark Sanford created a panel to establish firm criteria for award eligibility. The goal was to change the perception that the order was a political send-off. Currently all nominations are required to be made in writing. Persons who make a contribution that has statewide significance are eligible. Those who make a local community or professional contribution are eligible for the Order of the Silver Crescent. The name of each award is based on prominent features of the state flag. No sitting legislator up for election is eligible for any award. Among the awardees of the Order of the Palmetto were the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish, whom Governor Jim Hodges recognized in 1999 for their charity efforts. Trial lawyer Druanne White was honored with the award in 2006. Governors Henry McMaster and Nikki Haley received the award prior to their assuming office.http://archives.sc.gov/resources/orderofpalmetto/Documents/OOPalpha1971-2010.pdf Mary Chevilette Simms Oliphant was awarded the Order in 1982; she was the first woman to be honored in this fashion.

He was a delegate for New Hampshire in the Continental Congress from 1777 to 1779. George was born in New Castle, New Hampshire on April 26, 1720. His father, John Frost, who had been a British naval officer, died when he was twelve. He moved to Kittery, Maine, and was cared for by his uncle, William Pepperrell. As a young man he went to sea in one of his uncle‚Äôs ships. He was at sea over twenty years, many of them as captain of a merchant vessel. He returned to New Castle about 1760, still following a mercantile career. After marrying in Durham, he finally settled there in 1769. Frost was made a justice of the Strafford County, New Hampshire court of common pleas in 1773, and would remain in that post until 1791. In 1777, New Hampshire sent Frost as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he served until 1779. On his return he was named to the state‚Äôs Governor‚Äôs Council in 1781. The Council at the time functioned as the upper house of the state legislature, and he served there until 1784. George Frost died on June 21, 1796 at home in Durham. He is buried in the Pine Hill Cemetery there.

Both serve as the flagship attraction for their respective theme parks. Along with Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Castle is a main symbol of The Walt Disney Company. Exterior =Inspiration and design= Neuschwanstein Castle, Bavaria (Germany) Cinderella Castle was inspired by a variety of real and fictional palaces. These included Ch√¢teau d'Uss√©, Fontainebleau, Versailles and the ch√¢teaux of Chenonceau, Pierrefonds, Chambord, Chaumont and the Alc√°zar of Segovia but primarily, and most obviously, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. Other sources of inspiration include the spire of Notre-Dame de Paris, the Moszna Castle in Poland, built in the 18th century, and the Tyn Church in Prague, Czech Republic, built in the 14th century. The chief designer of the castle, Herbert Ryman, also referenced the original design for the castle in the film franchise Cinderella and his own well-known creation ‚Äî the Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland in California. =Construction= Magic Kingdom Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland Cinderella Castle was completed in July 1971, after about 18 months of construction. The castle is tall, as measured from water-level. Most sources quote the height as six feet taller when measuring from the concrete bottom of the moat, which itself is deep at the bridge. Cinderella Castle is more than taller than Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. A set-building trick known as forced perspective makes the castle appear larger than it is. At higher elevations, its proportions to full scale are reduced for elements such as stones, windows, and doors. This castle was the largest Disney theme park castle until the completion of the Enchanted Storybook Castle in Shanghai Disneyland Park. Cinderella Castle is designed to reflect the late-Gothic, flamboyant style of the 1400s. Unlike Disneyland's castle, no gold is used on the exterior; all gold colors are anodized aluminum. Despite its appearance, no bricks were used in its construction; the inner structure consists of six hundred tons of steel-braced frame construction, with a reinforced concrete wall encircling the structure to the full height of the outermost stone-like walls. All of the steel and concrete works are supported on a concrete drilled caisson foundation. Much less fiberglass is used than is popularly believed. Rather, most of the exterior is a thick, very hard fiber-reinforced gypsum plaster that is supported by light-gauge metal studs. Most fiberglass work is reserved for the exterior walls of more ornate upper towers. The roofs are not fiberglass, either. They are shingled in the same type of plastic that computer monitor shells are made from, attached to a cone of light gauge steel sheeting over the steel sub-frame. These towers were lifted by crane, then welded and bolted permanently to the main structure. Contrary to a popular legend, the castle cannot be taken apart or moved in any way in the event of a hurricane. It would take months to disassemble, it would be too dangerous to operate the crane required in windy conditions, and there would have to be a more structurally sound building to keep it in. As with every other building at Walt Disney World, it was simply efficient enough in design to handle a hurricane. It can easily withstand the 125 mph (200 km/h) wind speeds in Central Florida. Cinderella Castle is also surrounded by a moat, which contains approximately of water; however, unlike the drawbridge at Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland, Cinderella Castle cannot raise its bridge. There are a total of 27 towers on the castle, each numbered 1-29‚Äîtower numbers 13 and 17 were cancelled before construction when it was discovered that they could not really be seen from anywhere in the park, due mainly to the other Fantasyland buildings. The tower with the clock in front is number 10, the tallest is number 20. Number 23 is the other golden-roofed tower. Originally, a suite was planned for the Disney family and executives, but since Walt Disney died nearly five years before the park opened, it remained unfinished, and eventually was turned successively into a telephone call center, a dressing room, and is currently a hotel room. There are three elevators inside the castle. One is for guest use and goes between the lobby of Cinderella's Royal Table and the second floor restaurant. The second is for restaurant staff use, and is located in tower 2 to the left of the drawbridge. It has landings in the Utilidors, the mezzanine level in a break room, and on the second floor in the kitchen. The third elevator is in tower 20, and services the Utilidors, the breezeway, the kitchen of Cinderella's Royal Table, and the Cinderella Castle Suite. The suite is about below the level where the zipline cable that Tinker Bell \\"flies\\" on for the fireworks show is attached to tower 20. Access to the cable is by ladder. From January 2007 to December 2009 the suite was used as a prize for the Disney Dreams Giveaway at the Walt Disney World Resort during the Year of a Million Dreams celebration. Cinderella Castle was designed so that it was tall enough to be seen from the Seven Seas Lagoon in front of the Magic Kingdom, where many guests took ferries from the parking lot to the gates of the park. In theme park jargon, Cinderella Castle was conceived as the primary \\"weenie\\" (a term commonly used by Walt and his Imagineers) that draws new entering guests through Main Street, U.S.A. towards the central hub, from where all other areas can be reached. The Castle was repainted in the Fall of 2006, and now is a slightly off white, brown, and pinkish color, and the turrets are a much darker blue. On February 17th, 2020, in honor of the 70th Anniversary of the release of the 1950 Disney animated film Cinderella, Disney announced the castle will be getting repainted within the spring & summer 2020 with dark blue roofs, a slight rose pink color, and will have many gold trim accents on the castle, along with darker stone. Disney has assured that the castle will still be fully visible while the work is on going, and the fireworks shows will continue. The work is expected to be completed by the end of the Summer and getting ready for celebrating its 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort in 2021. Tokyo Disneyland The old color scheme at Tokyo Disneyland Generally considered to be a copy of Magic Kingdom's castle, the Tokyo version is tall. From 1986‚Äì2006, a popular walk-through attraction called the \\"Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour\\" was featured within the castle. In June 2006, the castle was repainted to differentiate it from Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom. The castle now has gold trimmings, the rooftops have been painted a different shade of blue, and the white stone of the turrets now has a tan/dirty-pink color. In 2018, Tokyo Disneyland's Cinderella Castle received a water fountains installed for new nighttime presentation Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland which premiered on July 10, as part of this 35th Anniversary celebration. =Special decorations= Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom has been temporarily re-decorated on a few occasions. * To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort on October 1, 1996, Imagineers transformed the front of Cinderella Castle into an 18-story \\"birthday cake.\\" Complete with red and pink \\"icing,\\" giant candy canes and 26 glowing candles, the castle served as the centerpiece for the 15-month-long celebration. Designed by Walt Disney Entertainment Florida and later constructed by the Imagineers, this was no small undertaking. It took more than of pink paint to cover the castle, which was decorated with multicolored \\"sprinkles,\\" 26 candles, ranging in height from 20‚Äì40 feet (6.1-12.2 m) tall, 16 two-foot (61 cm) long candy stars, 16 five- foot (1.5 m) candy bears, 12 five-foot (1.5 m) gumdrops, four six-foot (1.8 m) stacks of Life Savers, 30 three-foot (91 cm) lollipops, and 50 two-foot (61 cm) gumballs. Additionally, more than 1000 feet (305 m) of pink and blue inflatable \\"icing\\" was needed to finish it off. On January 31, 1998, the castle was transformed back to its original state. * On November 16, 2004, the castle was modified to appear as though it was strewn with toilet paper, and Stitch is King was posted on a turret as faux graffiti to mark the grand opening of Stitch's Great Escape! that day. The material was removed after the park closed that evening. * The castle's most recent redecoration commemorated the Happiest Celebration on Earth in honor of Disneyland's 50th anniversary and was formally unveiled on May 5, 2005. The castle's exterior was adorned with polished gold trim and accents, swags, banners and tapestries. Golden statues of Disney animated characters were also added to the exterior, including Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and Wendy Darling circling the tallest spire. Other statues included Kaa and King Louie from The Jungle Book, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa from The Lion King, Sebastian and Flounder from The Little Mermaid, the Cheshire Cat and White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, and Victor, Hugo and Laverne from The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Just above the front archway sat an enormous \\"stained-glass\\" mirror modeled after the magic mirror in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The mirror changed images every 40 seconds to feature each Disney castle and the date its park opened: Disneyland, 1955; the Magic Kingdom, 1971; Tokyo Disneyland, 1983; Disneyland Resort Paris, 1992; and Hong Kong Disneyland, 2005. The decorations were removed in late September 2006. File:25th Celebration Cinderella Castle 1997.jpgFor Walt Disney World's 25th anniversary celebration, c.1996 File:Magic Kingdom Cinderella Castle 50TH.jpgFor the Happiest Celebration on Earth File:Cinderella Castle.jpgCinderella Castle during Grad Nite =At night= Fireworks surround Cinderella Castle, dressed for Winter (December 2013) When the sun sets, the castle is illuminated by SGM Palco LED lighting fixtures placed on different castle levels and surrounding areas, providing an effective range of 16.7 million colors. The castle itself plays a role in the Magic Kingdom's former fireworks show, Wishes: A Magical Gathering of Disney Dreams, in which it changes color in synchronization with the dramatic music of the display. The same color changing and effects occurs for the other fireworks shows: HalloWishes (in Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party); Magic, Music and Mayhem (during Disney's Pirate and Princess Party); and the Christmas fireworks show Holiday Wishes during Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party. The castle's projection mapping technology has been used in several night events, such as their current fireworks spectacular Happily Ever After and the Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular, along with Halloween overlayed, Disney's Not-So-Spooky Spectacular and Holiday overlayed, Minnie's Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks. Castle with Christmas lights on it for the Christmas season (November 2014) At the park's closing, the nightly \\"Kiss Goodnight\\" is performed, in which Roy O. Disney's dedication speech for the Magic Kingdom is played throughout all over the park accompanied by Disney music which changes with the colors of the castle. Even when the park closes before 11pm (23:00), the show is performed a second time at 11pm (23:00), providing entertainment for guests of Disney resort hotels bordering the Seven Seas Lagoon. Beginning November 2007, for the first time, the \\"Castle Dream Lights\\", with over 200,000 LED Christmas lights (as Disneyland Paris has since 2004), covered Cinderella Castle and was lit nightly during a new stage show in front of the castle. =The Magic, the Memories and You= On January 18, 2011, a nighttime projection mapping show premiered at Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World. The show featured photographs and videos of park guests, taken by Disney's PhotoPass employees, combined with projections of Disney characters and attractions and pre-selected music. The Magic, the Memories and You show was presented before and after the nightly Wishes fireworks show at Magic Kingdom, as well as presented before and after Disneyland's regular nightly fireworks, and was part of Disney's \\"Let the Memories Begin\\" campaign for 2011. A parallel show existed at Disneyland, at the Disneyland Resort, taking place instead on the broad facade of It's a Small World. On September 3, this show ended its run and was replaced by a similar nighttime multimedia show, Celebrate the Magic, in 2012 and again by Once Upon a Time in Fall 2016. The Magic, The Memories and You is also inspired the similar theme song on Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland as part of the Tokyo Disney Resort 35th Anniversary celebration that premiered at Tokyo Disneyland in July 10th 2018 which also created as nod and tribute for the former nighttime projection show. Interior =Mosaics= Inside the castle's archway, a series of five mosaic murals tells the story of Cinderella. Designed by Imagineer Dorothea Redmond and crafted and set in place by a team of six artists led by mosaicist Hanns-Joachim Scharff, the ornate panels are shaped in a Gothic arch. The murals took 22 months to complete and contain just over 300,000 pieces of Italian glass and rough smalti (glass made specifically for mosaics traditionally used by Italian craftsmen) in more than 500 colors. Many of the hand-cut tiles are fused with sterling silver and 14-karat (58 percent) gold, and some are as small as the head of a tack. Looking closely at these ornate murals, one will notice that each of Cinderella's wicked stepsisters appears with a little added color - one sister's face is clearly \\"red with anger\\", while the other is a little \\"green with envy\\" as they watch Cinderella try on the glass slipper. =Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique= As of September 10, 2007, the castle is home to the \\"Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique\\", first introduced at Disney Springs (Formerly known as Downtown Disney). Inside, guests can receive a so-called \\"princess transformation\\", which features a Disney Princess make- up, one of three hairstyles, a manicure, a sash, and/or a gown, tiara, wand and shoes. The King's Gallery, the former gift shop in this space, has moved to the Main Street Cinema on Main Street, U.S.A. =Cinderella Castle Suite= Inside the upper levels of Cinderella Castle, there is a suite. This space is not large, and can be compared to the size of a master bedroom and bathroom in an average house. The location of the suite can be identified from the outside by locating the stained glass windows with pictures in the center on the north and west sides of the castle, about 2/3 of the way up. The glass used contains many small, multi-faceted pieces, which slightly obscures the view of the park from inside the suite. The suite adjoins a sizable exterior balcony on the east side. The walls around this balcony are about 5 feet (1.5 m) high. This balcony affords views to the north, east, and south. The balcony is only accessible through an emergency exit and is not a guest area. On June 7, 2005, Disney announced that the suite would be completely decorated and upholstered as a 'royal bedchamber', which can sleep up to six people. It was available as a prize during the Year of a Million Dreams (2007) celebration taking place at all eleven Disney theme parks, and an overnight stay in the apartment was a prize randomly awarded to a guest at the four Walt Disney World theme parks and Downtown Disney. =Cinderella's Royal Table= Cinderella's Royal Table, formerly known as King Stefan's Banquet Hall, is a restaurant inside the castle. Located on the second floor, guests can take the circular stairway or the elevator to the restaurant, where children are referred to as princes and princesses, while the adults in the party are referred to as lords and ladies. Walt Disney Imagineers had originally wanted to give the restaurant a regal name, and since there are no well-known characters from \\"Cinderella\\" that met their criteria, they instead took a little dramatic license and chose the name of Sleeping Beauty's father, King Stefan. The name was changed on April 28, 1997, in order not to confuse tourists. The restaurant is decorated not only with a number of stained glass windows and medieval objects, but with more than forty coats of arms. Each of these is an actual family seal, and represent some of the many people that played a major role in the design and construction of Walt Disney World, including Roger Broggie, Sr. (Imagineer and railroad aficionado who aided in the design of many attractions), Marc Davis (animator and theme park designer), Roy O. Disney (Walt's brother), John Hench (who designed the castle), Diane Disney Miller (Walt's daughter), Dick Nunis (former Chairman of Walt Disney Attractions), and Marty Sklar (Imagineering vice chairman and principal creative executive who worked alongside Walt Disney). Cinderella's Royal Table is also the location of \\"Fairytale Dining at Cinderella's Royal Table.\\" At breakfast, lunch and dinner Cinderella greets all guests in the castle foyer, and during the meal Disney princesses circulate among the tables. =Cinderella's Fairy Tale Hall (Tokyo Disneyland)= Cinderella's Fairy Tale Hall is a walk-through attraction located inside Cinderella Castle at Tokyo Disneyland. Cinderella, wanting to share her magical princess story, decided to open up the castle even during her absence and exhibit various artworks that show scenes from her story. At the lobby and corridor, guests will find eight murals showing how Cinderella changed from beloved daughter, to servant girl, and then to Princess. They will also see a diorama of Cinderella magically transformed into wearing a beautiful ball gown, and other artworks made from various materials such as paper, wood and glass. In the Grand Hall guests will find a magnificent chandelier, the renowned glass slipper, a throne, and special paintings that reveal a magical message when photographed using a flash. =Flight regulations (Walt Disney World)= Cinderella Castle uses forced perspective to appear taller than its actual height of 183 ft (58 m). By keeping the height of the castle's spire under tall, the castle at Walt Disney World was able to avoid Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations that would require flashing aircraft warning lights at the top. The two taller attractions at Walt Disney World, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Expedition Everest, top out at 199 and 199.5 feet, respectively, to avoid this requirement as well. As a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks, amid concerns that general aviation could pose a threat to public safety, the FAA placed a permanent Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) over the entire Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The flight restriction extends outward from an island near the Contemporary Resort () at a radius of up to above the ground level surface. Cinderella Castle is used as a visual reference. It has been a common growing legend that Disney chose to prohibit aviation above the park in order to make visitors feel even further separate from the outside world, but the true reason was, in fact, in response to the September 11th attacks. Law enforcement and Walt Disney World Cessna 172 aircraft, however, are exempt from this TFR. Logo Usage As Cinderella Castle is a Disney icon, it and Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle have become the basis for the logo of Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Television, Disney Music Group and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It was also heavily featured in advertisements for the Wonderful World of Disney, formerly shown on the Disney Channel.

With of unspoiled natural environment and a mountain range characterised by meandering twists and turns of hiking trails, the reserve offers an unbelievably refreshing break from the bustling city life. Here, the altitude varies between above sea level. The Suikerbosrand ridge was originally named after sugar cane (probably sorghum) found growing here by the party of general Hendrik Potgieter on 5 June 1836. Later the ridge and consequently the reserve's name became associated with the characteristic Transvaal-sugar bush (Protea caffra), a dominant vegetation type within the area's limits. Management Recent land acquisitions at the beginning of the twenty-first century have seen the reserve almost double in its size. A huge challenge for the reserve's management is to include the newly acquired lands in the reserve without disturbing the balance within the original area. The Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve is managed by the Gauteng province's Department of Agriculture, Conservation, Environment and Land Affairs, South Africa.

Written by Mark Millar and illustrated by Terry and Rachel Dodson, the series deals with teen pregnancy. The basic concept was created by Bill Jemas and Joe Quesada. Trouble was considered by Marvel's editorial group as the possible origin of Spider-Man. It was also meant to re-popularize romance comics (which were very popular in the 1950s, selling millions of copies), but failed. A trade paperback collecting the five issues was originally scheduled to be published on 18 February 2004, but canceled when Epic was shut down after Bill Jemas, who had been a driving force behind the imprint, resigned as president of Marvel Comics. A hardcover collection was published by Marvel on June 1, 2011. Characters * May ‚Äì A 17-year-old redhead and somewhat of a wildchild. * Mary ‚Äì May's blonde best friend and rather shy. * Ben ‚Äì Richard's older brother, who was often in hospitals as a child. * Richard (Richie) ‚Äì Ben's younger brother and their dad's clear favorite. Plot summary May and her best friend Mary work in a resort in the Hamptons during their summer vacation, looking for some fun away from home. Soon they make friends with fellow service staff members Richard and his brother Ben, and the four of them begin hanging out. After a couple of days of hard work and being bossed about by the guests, May and Mary go to a dance together. After the dance and a round of night swimming, they head back to their rooms; May takes Ben to her room and sleeps with him, while Mary tells Richie it is too fast for her, and she wants to wait before having sex with him. She later reveals to him it is because a palm-reader told her she would become a mom before she was twenty if she had sex in her teens. The same fortune-teller also told May nobody was ever going to call her \\"mom\\", which explains why May is so open in her relationships. Richie is not very understanding of her reasons for not sleeping with him, and starts an affair with May. May tells Mary she is cheating on Ben, but not with whom. A while later, she finds out that she is pregnant. Upon realizing the fortune-teller must have been wrong, Mary now finally sleeps with Richie, who then ends the affair with May. When May reveals her pregnancy to Ben, it turns out he's sterile and her affair with Richie, who must be the father, is uncovered. May is thinking about having an abortion, but decides against it. Afraid of going home and facing her dad with an unwanted child, May runs away. May finds a man to stay with, but does not tell him about her pregnancy. She grows to be disgusted by him. May contacts Mary and meets with her. Mary is still very angry with May for having an affair with Richie, and tells her she deserves all the trouble she is going through, but decides to help her when May tells her she has been thinking about suicide. Mary comes up with the plan to tell everybody the baby is hers, so May will not have to face her fundamentalist parents and Mary can test if she can trust Richie, who is still in love with her and writing her frequent letters, none of which she has answered yet. Once May gives birth to her healthy baby boy, Peter, Mary takes him to Richie, and they start a family, while May returns home to her parents as if nothing had happened. Covers All issues of Trouble featured photo covers by French photographer Philippe Bialobos in the style of teen romance novels, which is unusual for an American comic book series, with cover design by Joe Quesada. These covers were to appeal to a female audience (Marvel originally hoped for high sales outside the comic scene, particularly with a collected edition that was to be heavily promoted in many bookstores, but never published after the series did not do well in the direct market). The second printing of the first issue (Trouble #1: The Second Chances Edition) was the only one to feature a conventional comic book cover, drawn by Frank Cho. Reception The series' main characters, May, Ben, Mary and Richard, were clearly meant to be Peter Parker's Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and his parents Richard and Mary Parker. Thus, the revelation that Aunt May is actually Peter Parker's mother was highly controversial among Spider-Man fans; May's behavior in Trouble was contradictory to Aunt May's character, and the characters' appearances were remarkably different from their corresponding characters' looks in previous Spider-Man comics. Enough of the early lives of Spider-Man's family been established previously that the story contradicted prior continuity. For example, Aunt May and Uncle Ben were much older than Spider-Man's parents, his parents met while working for the C.I.A., and Aunt May was also established as not having children. While Dodson's art was praised, Millar's dialogue was criticized as not being representative of the time it is set in (supposedly the 1970s)Review of Trouble #1 by Chris Allen on moviepoopshoot.com and his storytelling failed to grab the audience; many complained that the characters were written too similarly, and were hard to keep apart, \\"save for the fact that one of the girls will do it on the first date when the other one won't.\\"Review of Trouble #1 by Paul O'Brien on The X-Axis, 13 July 2003 References External links *Trouble cover gallery at Comic Book DB *Newsarama's coverage of Marvel's press conference about Trouble (archived at archive.org)  :*SpiderFan.org Top Ten Reasons Not To Take The Trouble Mini-series Seriously (incorrectly states Mary's maiden name has never been revealed, it was Fitzpatrick) Category:2003 comics debuts Category:Adult comics Category:Epic Comics titles Category:Marvel Comics limited series Category:Romance comics ","title":"Trouble (comics)"},{"id":"1165780","text":"Charles Everett Traynor (August 21, 1937 ‚Äì July 22, 2002) was an American businessman and talent agent best known for having promoted the careers of pornographic film stars Linda Lovelace and Marilyn Chambers, both of whom were also married to him. Career Traynor was a minor figure in the early US East Coast pornographic film industry and appeared in a number of short \\"loops\\" in the early 1970s, usually with his then-wife, Linda Lovelace. He was the production manager of the 1972 movie Deep Throat. Relationship with Linda Lovelace In a 1980 article in Ms. magazine, \\"The Real Linda Lovelace\\", Gloria Steinem discussed Traynor and Lovelace's relationship. Steinem stated that \\"the myth that Lovelace loved to be sexually used and humiliated was created by her husband\\" and that he kept her as his prisoner. Lovelace claimed that Traynor forced her into prostitution by threatening her with a gun, repeatedly beat her, forced her to make pornography, and allowed men to rape her repeatedly. Lovelace tried to escape from Traynor three times before she was successful. She said that during Deep Throat one can see scars and bruises left on her legs from a beating by Traynor. According to Steinem, Traynor once stated, \\"When I first dated [Linda] she was so shy, it shocked her to be seen nude by a man... I created Linda Lovelace.\\" In 1979, Lovelace underwent a polygraph examination in which she repeated allegations she made against Traynor. During the session the test results supported the following allegations: * In 1971, Traynor forced Lovelace to have sex with five men for money in the Coral Gables Holiday Inn. He pointed a gun at Lovelace and threatened to kill her if she refused. * During her relationship with Traynor, Lovelace feared for her life if she tried to leave him. * He would hypnotize her. * He asked her to help him run the prostitution business, and when she refused he hit her. He used to beat her occasionally, which seemed to sexually excite him. He beat her the night before their wedding and during the filming of Deep Throat. * After she left him, Traynor threatened to shoot her sister's son if she did not return. * When out with other people, he would tell her not to speak, and she had to ask his permission to use the toilet. * The movie Deep Throat made approximately $600 million but Lovelace did not receive any money from Deep Throat and said that her husband received around $1,250 for the project; since Traynor kept control of the money. In a Vanity Fair article on Marilyn Chambers, whom Traynor married after Lovelace divorced him, Traynor said he considered himself a country boy in that he could live away from civilization and that if his woman said something he didn't like, he thought nothing of hitting her for it. Lovelace's allegations against Traynor have been disputed since she voiced them but in the second commentary on the DVD of \\"Inside Deep Throat,\\" one member of the production crew of Deep Throat backed up Lovelace's allegation of a brutal beating that she claimed left bruises that are visible in the film. The man said his motel room was next to Lovelace and Traynor's and emphatically stated that Traynor beat Lovelace viciously at night. Marilyn Chambers later claimed that Linda's allegations \\"hurt Chuck,\\" but Deep Throat, Part 2 actress Andrea True said that most people did not like Chuck Traynor and sided with Lovelace as to her allegations. Traynor was portrayed by actor Peter Sarsgaard in the 2013 film Lovelace. Death Traynor died at the age of 64 of a heart attack in Chatsworth, California, on July 22, 2002, three months after Lovelace died from massive trauma and internal injuries as a result of a car accident. Lovelace's sister, Barbara Boreman, later said in an interview in Inside Deep Throat that she (Barbara) was disappointed that Traynor died before she could kill him.

They were initially developed by and assigned to the Wehrmacht's \\"smoke troops\\" (Nebeltruppen). This weapon was given its name as a disinformation strategy designed to fool observers from the League of Nations, who were observing any possible infraction of the Treaty of Versailles, into thinking that it was merely a device for creating a smoke screen. They were primarily intended to deliver poison gas and smoke shells, although a high-explosive shell was developed for the Nebelwerfer from the beginning. Initially, two different mortars were fielded before they were replaced by a variety of rocket launchers ranging in size from . The thin walls of the rockets had the great advantage of allowing much larger quantities of gases, fluids or high explosives to be delivered than artillery or even mortar shells of the same weight. With the exception of the Balkans Campaign, Nebelwerfer were used in every campaign of the German Army during World War II. A version of the 21 cm calibre system was adapted for air-to-air use against Allied bombers. Weapons =10 cm Nebelwerfer 35= The lower muzzle velocity of a mortar meant that its shell walls could be thinner than those of artillery shells, and it could carry a larger payload than artillery shells of the same weight. This made it an attractive delivery system for poison gases. The U.S. Army's Chemical Warfare Service developed their 4.2 inch chemical mortar for precisely that reason and the Nebeltruppen shared that reasoning. Its first weapon was also a mortar, the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35, which was designed in 1934.Gander and Chamberlain, p. 298 =10 cm Nebelwerfer 40= Almost from the beginning, the army wanted more range than the 10 cm NbW 35's , but troop trials of two prototypes did not take place until May 1940. Neither was entirely satisfactory, but the best features of both were incorporated into the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 40. This was a very advanced breech-loading weapon with a recoil mechanism and an integral wheeled carriage. It had twice the range of its predecessor, but was eight times the weight and cost nearly ten times as much: 1,500 RM vs 14,000 RM. =15 cm Nebelwerfer 41= Rocket development had begun during the 1920s and reached fruition in the late thirties. This offered the opportunity for the Nebeltruppen to deliver large quantities of poison gas or smoke simultaneously. The first weapon to be delivered to the troops was the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 in 1940, after the Battle of France, a purpose- designed rocket with gas, smoke and high-explosive warheads. It, like virtually all German rocket designs, was spin-stabilized to increase accuracy. One very unusual feature was that the rocket motor was in the front, the exhaust venturi being about two-thirds down the body from the nose, with the intent to optimize the blast effect of the rocket as the warhead would still be above the ground when it detonated. This proved to greatly complicate manufacture for not much extra effect and it was not copied on later rocket designs. It was fired from a six-tube launcher mounted on a towed carriage adapted from that used by the 3.7 cm PaK 36 and had a range of .Gander and Chamberlain, p. 321 Almost five and a half million 15 cm rockets and 6,000 launchers were manufactured over the course of the war. =28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41= Schweres Wurfger√§t 41, M√©morial du Souvenir, Dunkirk 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 rocket launcher The 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 rockets were introduced in 1941, before Operation Barbarossa. They used the same motor, but carried different warheads. The rocket had a HE warhead, while the rockets were incendiary. The maximum range for either rocket was only , a severe tactical drawback. Both could be fired from their wooden packing cases or a special wooden (schweres Wurfger√§t 40 ‚Äì heavy missile device) or tubular metal (schweres Wurfger√§t 41 (sW.G. 41)) frame. Later, a towed launcher was developed that could take six rockets. Both rockets used the same launchers, but special liner rails had to be used for the rockets. A vehicular launch frame, the schwere Wurfrahmen 40 (sWu.R. 40), was also designed to improve the mobility of the heavy rockets. These were normally mounted on the sides of Sd.Kfz. 251 half-tracks, but they were also adapted for several different captured French tracked vehicles. The sWuR 40 was nicknamed the Stuka-zu-Fu√ü (\\"Stuka on Foot\\").Gander and Chamberlain, p. 322 Over six hundred thousand rockets and 700 launchers, excluding the sW.G. and sWu.R. firing frames, were made during the war. In total, 345 launchers were built from 1941. =21 cm Nebelwerfer 42= 21 cm Nebelwerfer 42 launcher in North Africa The 21 cm Nebelwerfer 42 rocket, which was introduced in 1942, had a longer range () and a simpler design than the smaller 15 cm rocket. It was only made with high- explosive warheads and was fired from a five-tube launcher that used the same carriage as the smaller weapon. Liner rails were used to allow it to fire the smaller 15 cm rocket. It was also adapted for use by the Luftwaffe to break up Allied bomber formations in 1943 as the Werfer-Granate 21. Over four hundred thousand rockets and 1,400 launchers were completed. =30 cm Nebelwerfer 42= The last German-designed rocket to be introduced was the 30 cm Nebelwerfer 42 in 1943. This was intended to replace the 28 and 32 cm rockets, which had too short a range. Advances in propellant chemistry also reduced its smoke signature. It could be fired from all of the same platforms as the older rockets and many of the older launchers were converted to be used with the newer rocket by installing adapter rails, although it also had its own purpose-designed launcher, the 30 cm Raketenwerfer 56. Fewer than two hundred thousand rockets and 700 launchers were built during the war. =8 cm Raketen- Vielfachwerfer= A battery of Katyusha launchers fires at German forces during the Battle of Stalingrad, 6 October 1942 8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer launcher mounted on a SOMUA MCG The Waffen-SS decided to copy the Soviet M-8 Katyusha rocket launcher as the 24-rail 8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer. Its fin- stabilized rockets were cheaper and easier to manufacture than the German spin-stabilized designs and used cheaper launch rails. It was also capable of using the considerable stocks of captured Soviet rockets. Separate production lines were set up under party control as the army refused to convert any of its existing factories, but not many actually appear to have been made. Production quantities are unknown, but photographic evidence shows the launcher mounted on lightly armored versions of the Sd.Kfz. 4 \\"Maultier\\"Chamberlain and Ellis, p. 188 and captured French SOMUA MCG half- track.Chamberlain and Ellis, pp. 224‚Äì225 =Panzerwerfer= To improve the mobility of the Nebelwerfer units, a ten-tube launcher was mounted on a lightly armored Sd.Kfz. 4 \\"Maultier\\" half-track chassis as the 15 cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Selbstfahrlafette Sd.Kfz. 4/1 (based on the Opel \\"Maultier\\", or \\"Mule\\", half-track). Three hundred of these were produced, split evenly between launchers and ammunition carriers (which were identical except for the launcher).Chamberlain and Ellis, p. 180 These were superseded in production by the 15 cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Schwerer Wehrmachtsschlepper (Panzerwerfer auf SWS), which had improved cross-country mobility and had greater ammunition storage than the \\"Maultier\\". The exact number built of the latter weapon is unknown, but evidence suggests that fewer than 100 were completed before the end of the war. =Air-to-air adaptation (Werfer-Granate 21 rocket)= Fw 190 being loaded with a Wfr.Gr. 21 rocket The Werfergranate 21 (Wfr. Gr. 21), also called the 21 cm BR (BR believed to be the abbreviation for \\"Bordrakete\\" in official Luftwaffe manuals) was an unguided air-to-air rocket version of the projectile used in the Nebelwerfer 42 and was first used in the defense of Schweinfurt on 17 August 1943. The Wfr. Gr. 21 was mounted on Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters (one launch tube under each wing) and on the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Messerschmitt Me 410 heavy fighters (two launch tubes under each wing) and was the first air-to-air rocket used by the Luftwaffe. Photographic evidence indicates that the Hungarians fitted three tubes under each wing of some of their twin-engined Me 210 Ca-1 heavy fighters. The rockets were used to break up Allied bomber combat box formations in order to enable more effective German fighter attacks against the scattered Allied aircraft. NOTE: Dornberger claims the Nebelwerfer was used against 1944 raids on Schweinfurt. However, the high drag caused by the launchers reduced the speed and maneuverability of the launching aircraft, a handicap that could prove fatal if Allied fighters were encountered. Also, the launch tube's underwing mounting setup, which usually aimed the projectile at about 15¬∞ upwards from level flight to counter the considerable ballistic drop of the projectile in flight after launch, added to the drag problem. One experimental fitment trial program of up to 33 of the 21 cm rockets, meant to be fired from a single aircraft in an upwards direction (much like the Schr√§ge Musik upward firing autocannon on German Nachtj√§ger night fighters) was proposed for the Heinkel He 177A as the Grosszerst√∂rer, mounted in the central fuselage and flying below American combat box bomber formations to down them, but the quintet of He 177A-5 airframes set aside for the Grosszerst√∂rer program only flew as experimental airframes, seeing no active combat deployment. Use in combat After the crew had loaded and aimed the launcher, they had to take cover away to avoid the exhaust flames, and would fire the rockets with an electric switch. After firing, however, a long streak of smoke was visible from a considerable distance, leaving the Nebelwerfer vulnerable to counter-battery fire. It was therefore necessary to relocate the launcher and crew as soon as possible after firing.Gander and Chamberlain, pp. 321-22 The loud, shrill howling noise of the incoming rockets led Allied soldiers in the Sicily campaign to give it the nicknames \\"Screaming Mimi\\" and \\"Moaning Minnie\\". Organization Generally, mortars of the Nebeltruppen were organized into batteries of six or eight mortars, three batteries per battalion. The towed rocket launchers had six launchers per battery, three batteries per battalion. Usually, three battalions formed a regiment. Midway through the war brigades were formed, each with two regiments. A regiment was sometimes reinforced with a Panzerwerfer battery of 6-8 vehicles. From 1942, their designations changed from Nebelwerfer to simply Werfer. As part of its general expansion, the Waffen-SS began to form its own Werfer units in 1943, although they never formed any unit bigger than a battalion. These were organized much the same as their Army counterparts. Organizational history The 1st, 2nd and 5th Nebelwerfer Battalions, each equipped with 24 10 cm Nbw 35 mortars in three batteries, were ready when the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939. The 1st and 2nd Battalions participated in that campaign, while the 5th remained in Western Germany. One battery of Artillery Regiment 222 was converted to 10 cm NbW 35s and participated in the Norwegian Campaign.Die Nebel- und Werfertruppe, p. 366 By May 1940, five more battalions had been formed, all equipped with 10 cm NbW 35 mortars, filling out the sequence from 1 to 8, but only the first five were combat ready when the Battle of France began on 10 May 1940. The first 15 cm NbW 41 rocket launchers were delivered in July 1940, forming three new regiments, the 51st, 52nd and 53rd Nebelwerfer Regiments, each with three battalions. The 54th Regiment was formed from the 1st and 7th Nebelwerfer Battalions. The Nebel-Lehr Regiment was formed from the Nebeltruppen school in Celle on 29 April 1941 with two battalions, one each with 10 cm NbW 35 mortars and 15 cm NbW 41 rockets. The independent Nebelwerfer Battalions retained their mortars with the exception of the 8th, which received rockets before Operation Barbarossa. The only way of differentiating those units equipped with mortars during this period from those with rockets being the \\"d.\\" or \\"do.\\" suffix added to the designations of the rocket-equipped units. Beginning in November 1941, the eight Decontamination Battalions were fully equipped with 28/32 cm NbW 41 rockets (some had sW.G. 40 and 41 launching frames earlier) and reorganized into three Heavy Werfer Regiments. During early 1942, the 10th Mountain Werfer Battalion was formed from the 104th Decontamination Battalion and sent to 20th Mountain Army in Finland. In late 1943, Werfer-Battalion 11 was organized from two batteries already in Finland, including the battery from Artillery Regiment 222 that participated in the invasion of Norway. A new Panzerwerfer battery was sent from Germany to be its third battery at the same time. Both battalions retreated into Northern Norway after the Finnish armistice in September 1944 after the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive.Die Nebel- und Werfertruppe, pp. 362‚Äì71 The 9th Nebelwerfer Battalion was given rockets, redesignated as the first battalion of Werfer-Regiment 71 and sent to North Africa late that year. Most of the second battalion were sent to Tunisia in early 1943, where it surrendered in May. The remainder of the regiment fought in Sicily and mainland Italy for the rest of the war.Die Nebel- und Werfertruppe, pp. 261-312 Panzerwerfer batteries began to reinforce the Werfer Regiments beginning in mid-1943 and the regiments were paired into brigades beginning in early 1944. In late 1944, the brigades were redesignated as Volks-Werfer Brigades although no organizational changes occurred. A total of fifteen Werfer and Volks-Werfer Brigades were formed, plus one Positional Werfer Brigade (Stellungs-Werfer-Brigade) during the war.

Retrieved March 15, 2015.  Early life  Dorothea Mitchell was born in England in 1877. The family, including her younger sister Vera, moved from England to Bombay (now Mumbai), India, for her father's work in establishing railroads throughout the British Empire. Dorothea and Vera were educated as colonial elite in India and were taught etiquette and dancing, as well as other pursuits. Mitchell's mother also encouraged her daughters to learn some traditionally masculine skills as well, such as carpentry, riding, and marksmanship. Shortly after the family returned to England in the 1890s, Dorothea's father died. The family's upper class status in India reverted to middle class in England, and Dorothea began working various jobs to support her mother and younger sister.Cheryl Desroches. \\"The Lady Lumberjack: An Annotated Collection of Dorothea Mitchell's Writings. (Book review)\\", Ontario History, September 22, 2006 - via ProQuest (subscription needed).  Biography  Mitchell emigrated to Canada on her own in 1904 for employment opportunities, first landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She worked various jobs, among them teaching dancing and swimming lessons, while waiting for her mother and sister to join her in Hamilton, Ontario, part of the Greater Toronto Area. When illness delayed her mother and sister's arrival to Canada, Mitchell left Hamilton to work for a mining engineer in Silver Mountain, Ontario, in 1909. Although the job's tenure was brief due to the economic decline in the silver mining industry, Mitchell remained in the region and began working for the Canadian National Railway (CNR) as a station master, and also operated the general store. Realizing the value of lumber, Mitchell purchased a sawmill and hired workers, earning her nickname of \\"Lady Lumberjack\\". The nickname is suitable for Mitchell according to those who knew her; they describe her as proper and ladylike, yet independent and fearless at the same time.\\"Dorothea Mitchell: A Reel Pioneer.\\" Shebafilms Kelly Saxberg. Retrieved March 15, 2015. For example, when cheated out of $130 in her sawmill business, she single- handedly took the perpetrator to court and won, eventually using the story of a crooked timber dealer as inspiration when writing her first film, A Race For Ties. Unmarried women were not ordinarily entitled to a free grant, but Mitchell was granted homestead in 1907, although she was permitted only 79 acres, less than half of what men were typically given. She was the first single woman granted homestead in the province of Ontario. Mitchell lived in a bungalow on the property with her mother and sister, who had finally arrived to Canada from England. Mitchell remained spirited and determined in her various interests throughout her life. In her autobiography, she recounts her foray into photography, stating \\"After I traded an old cook stove for a camera, I became renowned for my photography instead of my dresses.\\" Her interest in film, as well as various other endeavours including writing, assisted her later in her filmmaking.  Film career  Mitchell moved to Port Arthur, Ontario (now part of Thunder Bay) in 1921, joining her mother and sister, who had moved there the previous year. Again, Mitchell worked various jobs such as teacher and accountant, through which she met Fred Cooper, a local bakery owner. Mitchell's local reputation as a proficient photographer and ardent writer (involved in local newspapers and theatres) made her a perfect partner for the aspiring filmmaker Cooper, and together they co- founded the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society (PAACS) in February 1929. The society has the distinction of being the first amateur film group in Canada, and their first film, A Race For Ties, is the first Canadian feature-length film by non-professionals. =A Race For Ties (1929)= Mitchell put her varied experiences to use, serving as actor, production manager, editor, casting director, and writer for A Race For Ties. As writer, Mitchell was inspired by her own experiences, telling a story of a small sawmill owner competing against a large timber company to win a railway tie contract. In her autobiography, Lady Lumberjack, Mitchell recounts her involvement with the Cinema Society, stating \\"[A Race For Ties] was based on a timber deal I had myself experienced in the adjacent bush country, but of course making a young girl the heroine. As the author, I was privileged to choose the cast, and, with the Photographer and Director, became a charter member of the Amateur Cinema Society of Thunder Bay.\\" The film debuted at Thunder Bay's Lyceum Theatre in May 1929. The three-night event was incredibly popular. Some four hundred people had to be turned away because maximum capacity had been reached. Mitchell recalls the event as \\"a truly posh affair. Expressions of opinion were quite complimentary, perhaps the most extravagant coming from the manager of our biggest local movie house, the Colonial. He said our effort was definitely ahead of many of the early professional productions.\\" The PAACS also showed their newsreel at the event. Although films in the 1920s were usually accompanied by introductory newsreels, the PAACS newsreel was the first to include the news of local Northwestern Ontario events, as well as national and international events. =Sleep Inn Beauty (1929) and The Fatal Flower (1930)= The PAACS's second feature-length film, Sleep Inn Beauty, was again produced, cast, and written by Mitchell, who adapted the scenario from a short story. In her autobiography, she recounts how the success of the first two films encouraged the PAACS to expand, renting an office and more equipment. However, in 1931 the Society was forced to close due to dwindling interest from members and accumulated bank debt from the filming of the uncompleted The Fatal Flower. The onset of the Great Depression, as well as the introduction of sound film to cinema, also contributed to the Society's closure. =The Fatal Flower Project (2004)= In 2004, a small group of film historians, filmmakers, writers, and artists in Thunder Bay endeavoured to finish Mitchell's last film, The Fatal Flower. Led by local filmmaker Kelly Saxberg, the members of \\"The Fatal Flower Project\\" became familiar with Mitchell through archival footage, as well as her autobiography and previous films, and proceeded to finish the silent film, editing the raw footage and adding a plot, inter-title cards, and accompanying music. The film previewed at Thunder Bay's historic Finnish Labour Temple.  Later life  In 1930, Mitchell became the first secretary-treasurer for the new Port Arthur General Hospital. After the closure of the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society in 1931, Mitchell's mother and sister died and Mitchell, although no longer having to support her dependents, took over a real estate and accounting business in Port Arthur. Mitchell was also involved in St. John's Anglican Church and the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire in Port Arthur. In 1939, at the age of 63, Mitchell enlisted in the Red Cross Society and worked in the transportation corps and the office of Voluntary Registration of Canadian women at the onset of World War II. She continued working for the military, helping the dependents of servicemen as well as aiding British orphans until she retired to the West Coast in 1941, settling down in Victoria, British Columbia. In Victoria, she became involved once again in amateur filmmaking, joining the Victoria Amateur Movie Club, as well as joining the Victoria Branch of the Canadian Authors Association as secretary. In 1968, at the age of 91, Mitchell published a book of autobiographical short stories, entitled Lady Lumberjack. Mitchell died in Victoria in 1976, at the age of 99.

Retrieved March 15, 2015. In her review of Lady Lumberjack, the annotated collection of works edited by Michel S. Beaulieu and Ronald N. Harpelle, Cheryl Desroches states of Mitchell: \\"If she found living in the woods at times inconvenient, she would have laughed at the thought of herself as soft. Lady Lumberjack is laden with evidence of Mitchell's ability to defy notions, typical of the era, of appropriate female behaviour. [...] Mitchell's experiences fostered a strong belief that women were capable of anything men could do.\\" The anthology \\"provide[s] a much-needed first-hand female perspective of the pioneer experience. Because she wrote about her extraordinary life in such matter-of-fact terms, however, her contributions to the feminist movement (and to literature more generally) has been overlooked in the broader historical record.\\" Desroches praises Beaulieu and Harpelle's efforts to include Mitchell with the likes of Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill as an early advocate of women's rights.

The university's nine colleges focus on the liberal arts with a select collection of professional studies. In 2019, its undergraduate enrollment was approximately 2,800. Founded in 1968, the university grew out of a local Baptist church. It operated out of assorted buildings until the first purpose-built campus building was completed in 1982. A subsidiary campus operates in Orlando. Eighteen sports teams represent the university in NCAA Division II competitions.  History  Palm Beach Atlantic University was the vision of and was founded by Jess C. Moody in 1968 while he was the pastor of First Baptist Church of West Palm Beach. He served until the first class graduated in 1972 and resigned from the presidency to focus on his duties at First Baptist Church. Two laymen of the church, Donald Warren and Riley Sims, became involved as trustees before the university began and continued to contribute time and support for many years. Warren served as chairman of the trustees for 38 years until 2007. In July 1972, Warner E. Fusselle, previously president of Truett-McConnell College, became the second president of the university and led the accreditation process with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools which was achieved in December 1972. George Borders, Vice President of Student Affairs at Stetson University, became the third president of Palm Beach Atlantic University in 1978. He was popular with students and the Florida Baptist Convention. After his resignation in 1981 to become the president of the Florida Baptist Foundation, Claude H. Rhea became president. Rhea's leadership saw the development of the Rinker campus and expansion of academic programs. Paul R. Corts, previously president of Wingate College, became the fifth president of Palm Beach Atlantic. He presided over the addition of two graduate programs, from 1991 until 2002. He resigned in 2002 to accept a position as Assistant Attorney General for Administration with the United States Department of Justice. David W Clark, President of FamilyNet, and founding provost of Regent University became the sixth President in 2003. During his presidency enrollment grew from 2600 to 3291. Five new buildings were completed including the magnificent Warren Library, a mini campus in Wellington was built, and for a new athletic campus were acquired. The university budget grew from $43 million to $73 million. Over 4,600 or 40 percent of all degrees were awarded during his tenure. President Clark announced his retirement during the 2008-9 academic year the end of June. On July 1, 2009, Lu Hardin took office as the seventh president of Palm Beach Atlantic University. A former Arkansas state senator, Hardin had previously served as the president of the University of Central Arkansas. Hardin resigned the presidency of PBA on March 4, 2011, shortly before pleading guilty in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, to two federal felony charges (wire fraud and money laundering) which occurred during his tenure at UCA. On March 10, 2011, William M. B. ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Fleming, Jr., the university's vice president for development, was named interim president by the university's Board of Trustees. After a nationwide search, Fleming, who had served as interim president for more than a year, was elected by the trustees as the University‚Äôs eighth president, beginning his presidency on May 8, 2012.  Campus  Palm Beach Atlantic University PBA's campus is located in West Palm Beach. The first structure built specifically for PBA, the W.G. Lassiter Jr. Student Center, was completed in 1982.

The title is an allusion to a quote by the late American stand-up comedian Bill Hicks.Twenty Other Great Albums That Aren't Nevermind, 20 years later [Part I] Although well received and popular at the time of its release, Steady Diet is often overlooked by many music journalists when writing about Fugazi's career, but remains a favorite among fans of the band.Perlah, Jeff. \\"The Independent\\". Guitar World. March 2002. Recording Steady Diet of Nothing was recorded during January and February 1991 at Inner Ear Studios and is notable for being the group's first self-produced release. As a result of not having an outside producer besides engineer Don Zientara, the album's recording and mixing sessions were tough on the band. Guy Picciotto said of making the record, \\"[it] was a tough record for us to make. It was our first attempt at producing and mixing by ourselves, and we didn‚Äôt feel like we had a really good handle, technically, on what we wanted to do. And we were also pretty fried from a shitload of back-to-back touring. I appreciate Steady Diet for a lot of things, but there was a flatness to both the performances and the sound that was weird to us.\\" Singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye explained, \\"It was like we were walking on eggshells, trying not to offend each other. No one would say, \\"Turn your guitar down,\\" or, \\"Turn the drums down.\\" So we ended up getting a democratic mix, and a lot of times democratic mixes equal bad mixes. And I feel Steady Diet is a classic example of us being very conservative, although a lot of people think it's our best record.\\" Music & lyrics The lyrical content of Steady Diet is more overtly political than any other record Fugazi has released. This is most evident on \\"Dear Justice Letter\\" which was inspired by Supreme Court liberal stalwart William J. Brennan, who had recently retired. While obviously emotional, the language of the \\"letter\\" is more than a little obscure. Brennan's politics and defense of individual rights were largely quite in tune with Fugazi's so \\"Dear...\\", on one level, can be read as a rant against abandonment of duty to the liberal block of the Supreme Court. \\"Here comes the kiss off..\\" The band addressed the subject of personal freedom on \\"Reclamation\\" and Ian also dedicated \\"KYEO\\" to Rodney King during the 'Steady Diet' tour.* p. 304, 305 Musically the album is far more sparse than the band's other works, with the conservative, dry production serving to highlight the rhythm section of bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty. \\"Long Division\\" and its melodic inter-weaving bass and guitar lines was the band's first foray into pop melodies, while \\"Latin Roots\\" recalled the band's earlier dub-influenced stylings, with Canty laying down a Stewart Copeland- influenced drum beat.

The act was sponsored by California's Democratic Congressman Norman Mineta, an internee as a child, and Wyoming's Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, who had met Mineta while visiting an internment camp. The third co-sponsor was California Senator Pete Wilson. The bill was supported by the majority of Democrats in Congress, while the majority of Republicans voted against it. The act was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The act granted each surviving internee US$20,000 in compensation, equivalent to $ in , with payments beginning in 1990. The legislation stated that government actions had been based on \\"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\\" as opposed to legitimate security reasons.100th Congress, S. 1009, reproduced at internmentarchives.com; accessed September 19, 2006.

Because the law was restricted to American citizens, and to legal permanent residents, ethnic Japanese who had been taken from their homes in Latin America (mostly from Peru), were not covered in the reparations, regardless of whether they had remained in the United States, had returned to Latin America, or had been deported to Japan after the war.

United States majority opinion by Justice Hugo Black, reproduced at findlaw.com, accessed September 11, 2006 =Redress and reparations= Some compensation for property losses was paid in 1948, but most internees were unable to fully recover their losses. In the 1960s and 1970s, a renewed movement formed within the Japanese American community to obtain redress for the wartime incarceration. The Japanese American Citizens League introduced a resolution to seek individual reparations at its 1970 conference and soon after began working with community activists and political leaders to lobby for legislative action. In 1979, the National Council for Japanese American Redress filed a class action lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of former camp inmates, and in 1980, after a push from Senator Daniel Inouye and Congressmen Robert Matsui, Spark Matsunaga and Norman Mineta, Congress appointed a committee to study the effects of the incarceration and the potential for redress. The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians held investigative hearings in eleven U.S. cities, at which over 750 individuals gave testimony of their experiences during and after the war. In 1983, the Commission published its findings in the report Personal Justice Denied, writing that the displacement of Japanese Americans during the war had been the result of \\"race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership\\" and recommending monetary reparations be made to former internees. Although the bill to issue a formal apology and implement the CWRIC's recommendations, introduced in 1987, faced heavy resistance from President Reagan and Senate Republicans opposed to increased federal spending, it was signed into law on August 10, 1988. On October 9, 1990, a ceremony was held to present the first reparations checks. Nine elderly Issei received $20,000 each and a formal apology signed by President George H. W. Bush. United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh presented the checks to the attendees, dropping to his knees to reach those in wheelchairs. Payments to surviving internees or their heirs continued until 1993, overseen by the Office of Redress Administration, one of two government agencies created to carry out the 1988 act's implementation. The other, the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund, was established in order to meet the redress bill's provision to educate the public about the incarceration. $50 million was authorized \\"to sponsor research and public educational activities\\" in 1988, but anti-spending lobbying put the education program on hold until 1994 and reduced the final amount to $5 million. President Bill Clinton appointed an advisory board in 1996, and the CLPEF was used to fund various educational programs and grants from 1997 to 1998.Sharon Yamato. \\"Civil Liberties Public Education Fund,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed July 17, 2014).

It had a population of 10,058 inhabitants in January 2017.Overzicht inwonersaantal Tytsjerksteradiel - Tytsjerksteradiel On January 1, 1989 the official name of the village was changed from Bergum to Burgum. This was done to match the Frisian name of the village. Bergum is the current name in Dutch. The name Burgum is suggestive of an area of higher altitude than the surrounding area. The province of Friesland is bordered in the north by the Wadden Sea. In ancient and medieval times, habitation in Friesland occurred only in those areas which were elevated above sea level (for example in Burgum) or on artificially built mounds known as terp, weird or ward. These mounds were areas of refuge in times of flooding. The artificial mounds became redundant after the building of the dykes on the border of the Wadden Sea. Habitation of this area goes back to the Stone Age. Main things to see in Burgum are the Town Hall and the Kr√∫stsjerke (Cross Church) which is the remainder of a convent burned in the Eighty Years' War. Within the town and its surroundings there are many events to engage with local culture, food and people. As the town is a part of the province of Friesland and it centrally located it is easy to get around to most places by car or through public transportation. The town itself has various restaurants such as De Pleats which is a restaurant housed in a historical farm. The shopping center consists of a mixture of boutique shops such as Aline Fashion or mass retailers like Hema. Other facilities in the town are a library, a pharmacy, an indoor pool, an indoor and outdoor amusement park, an observatory, a harbor, a newly constructed park and in summer a fruitgarden where you can pick berries from the branch to take home. In summer you would not want to miss seeing a game of the local sports 'Fierljeppen' as it is mostly unique to the province and Burgum has the most modern Fierljep arena of the Netherlands.

Contrary to popular perception, Amherst Island is not one of the Thousand Islands.FIELD TRIP GUIDE: GEOLOGY OF THE KINGSTON AREA 80th Meeting of Eastern Section of the Seismological Society of America at Queen's University, Kingston ON Canada, October 5, 2008White, James (1910) Place-Names in the Thousand Islands . Government Printing Bureau. The island is part of Loyalist Township in Lennox and Addington County. Amherst Island is located about offshore from the rest of Loyalist Township and is serviced by an automobile and truck ferry from Millhaven. The island measures over in length from Bluff Point in the southwest to Amherst Bar in the northeast and over at its widest point across. The island is about in size and is one of the largest islands in the Great Lakes. The Amherst Island archipelago also includes: Nut Island, Grape Island and the Brother Islands. These small islands cover over or about . Nut Island is the largest of the islands that immediately surround Amherst Island and is about off the Amherst Island coast between Amherst Bay and Long Point Bay. Grape Island is located about off the Amherst Island coast, and can be easily seen from shore. The Brother Islands are situated between Amherst Island and the Lemoine Point Conservation Area in Kingston, Ontario. History Amherst Island was originally inhabited by Indigenous peoples who gave it the name Kaounesgo. Amherst Island was known by the French as Isle Tonti, after Henri de Tonty, who accompanied La Salle during his explorations. The island was later settled by United Empire Loyalists. In a proclamation by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe on 16 July 1792, the island was renamed from Isle Tonti to Amherst Island, in honour of Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, who was commander-in-chief of British forces in North America. At the same time, he named the archipelago for the victorious Generals at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham: Wolfe Island, this one, Howe Island, Carleton Island and Gage Island. The last is now known as Simcoe Island. In 1788, the island was granted by the Crown to Sir John Johnson, who had lost most of his possessions in the War of Independence. In 1823, Sir John's daughter, Catharine Maria Bowes, gained control of the island and legend is that she later lost it in a card game in Ireland. What can be documented is that in 1827 Mrs. Bowes was in financial trouble and gave a power of attorney to the Stephen Moore, 3rd Earl Mount Cashell, who purchased the island from her in 1835. Mount Cashell's interest in Amherst Island was both profit-oriented and humanitarian. Financially, he hoped to reap large returns on his investment by settling the island with industrious immigrants who would clear and cultivate the land, thereby improving its value and providing him with a steady rental income. But his vision extended beyond pecuniary ends. Inspired by the evangelical belief in human improvement, he thought that by encouraging emigration from Ireland to Canada he could help solve the overpopulation of his homeland, create a prosperous, loyal farming population in the new world, and strengthen the Empire through a transatlantic grain trade. Mount Cashell became a leading spokesman of these views in North America. Mount Cashell brought settlers out from Ireland giving them seven- year leases at a nominal rent and requiring them to make certain improvements each year. He financed the establishment of a general store, maintained the church and glebe, provided the resident land agent with a home, and divided the island up into individual farms with a large section reserved for timber. Families from the barony of Ards, County Down, began arriving in the 1820s. Throughout the 1830s and 1840s their numbers swelled as friends and relatives continued to arrive, but by the 1860s the movement had subsided. Why they happened to be from the Ards, property not owned by Mount Cashell, is unclear. Settlers who arrived in the early years moved straight onto the land while those arriving after 1850 seem to have worked for friends before renting land. By 1841, the community had three schools and a population of over 1,000 people. The majority of families were Presbyterian, 5-6 were Church of England, 10-12 were Roman Catholics and only a few were Methodist. Most settlers lived in shanties or one-storey log houses on the rented land, although some had purchased their property from Mount Cashell. 1878 map of Amherst Island While Amherst Islanders prospered from the grain trade in the 1840s, their landlord fell upon hard times. The famine in Ireland hurt Mount Cashell badly. Distressed Irish tenants and declining rents placed a heavy burden on a landlord who was already in debt because of lavish living and beleaguered by an untrustworthy agent's embezzlement. In 1848, he mortgaged Amherst Island. Several more mortgages followed on his Canadian properties, and in 1856 his creditors foreclosed and Amherst Island was sold at public auction for much less than its market value to Robert Perceval-Maxwell (1813-1905). Some of the current residents of the island are descendants of those early settlers.New Lease on Life: Landlords, Tenants, and Immigrants in Ireland and Canada, by Catharine Anne Wilson (1994, McGill-Queen's Press) Amherst Island at mid-19th century was a mixed economy of farming wheat and barley, fishing in the Bay of Quinte, sailing the Great Lakes, and shipbuilding at the local yard of David Tait. Soon, however, the shipyard closed when local forests were depleted; sailing declined as railways won out over water transport; and crop farming gave way to more stable, mixed dairy farming. As the economy changed those who could not make the transition left, and those who remained behind managed to purchase and expand their farms. In all this, R.P. Maxwell and his agent were the primary financiers, establishing the agricultural society and a cheese factory, promoting improvements, and financing loans and mortgages. Throughout these years, the Ards emigrants did very well. Many became proprietors, they held prominent positions in the community, and the Island became well known for its 'Irishness'. John Watson, from Portaferry, called his pub on the Island the 'County Down Inn'. The stone fences that lined the land were modelled after those on the Ards. Community The Frontenac II, a passenger and vehicle ferry servicing Amherst Island on Lake Ontario in the community of Loyalist Township, Ontario. The two main communities on Amherst Island are Stella and Emerald. Stella is the major hamlet, where the ferry docks are, and lends its name also as the postal outlet name for the island. Emerald is a collection of four houses and a church towards the west end of the island. The island is accessible from the mainland only by water or air. A toll ferry service, carrying cars and people, connects the hamlet of Stella on the island with Millhaven on the mainland. The ferry, M/V Frontenac II, runs 365 days a year, with a crossing time of about 20 minutes. There is a nominal charge for bicycles and motorcycles while walk-on passengers are free. The ferry service is run by Loyalist Township. The resident population of about 450 people doubles during the summer months. The Amherst Island Public School doubles as a community centre for Amherst Island outside regular school hours. The Ministry of Transportation has awarded a $51.7 million contract for the conversion of the existing ferry docks from side-loading ramps to end-loading ramps to allow for easier access to and from the Island. Construction is expected to take place during 2017/18 and will include improved vehicle queuing areas, public restrooms and heated waiting areas. MTO has further announced plans to construct a new $20 million ferry for Amherst Island to replace the M/V Frontenac II near the end of 2019. Amherst Island Radio 92.1 FM A volunteer community radio station, Amherst Island Radio CJAI, began broadcasting on April 1, 2006, originally on 93.7 FM. Previously licensed as a developmental community radio station, CJAI changed frequency to 92.1 FM in October 2007 following the licensing of a new radio station on the adjacent 93.5 frequency in Kingston, and was granted a permanent license on December 6, 2007. It now operates as a 250-watt class B community broadcast undertaking. It is a 100% volunteer operated station, and is concerned with the preservation of the Amherst Island way of life, accurate and timely information reporting, and the promotion of Canadian musical talent. Notable islanders Native islanders include Harry Raymond Fleming (1892‚Äì1942), Canadian MP for Humboldt, Saskatchewan, and English-born artist Daniel Fowler (1810-94), who immigrated to Amherst Island in 1843 and remained there until his death. Fowler stated in his autobiography: \\"I found a sufficient variety of subjects on the island, along with shore and inland, and never went away on any sketching trip.\\" Inspired by the Island's bucolic landscape, flora and fauna, Daniel Fowler was considered by his peers as \\"one of the fathers of Canadian Art\\". The house he lived in during his final years still exists on the north shore of the Island. A plaque commemorates the site. Ecology Amherst Island as seen from mainland Amherst Island is internationally recognized for concentrations of wintering hawks and owls and is home to the famous Owl Woods nature reserve. Up to 10 species of owls have been recorded during a single winter. short-eared owls, long-eared owls and great horned owls are among the resident bird population. Visitors from the far and near north - snowy owls, saw-whet owls, and the rare boreal owl as well as eastern screech owls and barred owls ‚Äì add to the owl population during late fall and winter. Both red-tailed hawks and rough-legged hawks are usually present, and there are annual sightings of bald eagles, peregrine falcons and turkey vultures. Amherst Island is internationally known as an Important Bird Area and a key migratory location for birds; this fact has caused some concern for those wary of the proposed industrial wind turbine project slated to be built on the island. The island is noted for farming, particularly of sheep of which there are several thousand on the island. The island's roads, built long ago, have little automobile traffic making the island an excellent locale for cycling, especially on the gravel and dirt roads that hug the shores of Lake Ontario. The island has warm moderate summers, cold brisk winters and steady lake winds most of the year. \\"Islands of Life\\", a report published in 2010 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, ranks Amherst Island second in biodiversity significance among the islands of northeast Lake Ontario; second only in significance to its larger neighbour, Wolfe Island. Amherst Island is listed in the 100 Nature Hot Spots in Ontario, a book released in 2016, written by Chris Earley and Tracy C. Read.http://www.fireflybooks.com/index.php/catalogue/product/11281-100-nature- hot-spots-in-ontario-the-best-parks-conservation-areas-and-wild-places Dry stone walls The Dry Stone Walling Association of Canada (aka Dry Stone Canada) believes that Amherst Island contains the largest known concentration of historic Irish dry stone walls in Canada. Many of the walls are considered to be at least 170 years old or older. Wind farm turbine development Steady lake winds, especially in winter, make some people believe that the island is an ideal potential location for wind turbines. Several companies have expressed interest in developing industrial wind turbine projects on the island. After initial assessment two firms have withdrawn; one is still pursuing this action, encouraged by residents who have signed leases for wind farm turbines to be sited on their lands. Some island residents are opposed to the project, raising concerns that the proposed twenty-six 51-storey wind turbines will have a negative impact on the rich natural and cultural heritage and on tourism, both on the island and in local mainland communities, as well as on migratory bird, bat and Blanding's Turtle populations. Several groups of residents have formed as a result of the proposals. The island landowners who have agreed to host turbines on their land have formed Citizens of Amherst Island for Renewable Energy (CAIRE). Those opposed to wind power development on the island have formed the Association to Protect Amherst Island (APAI) and a coordinated sister group, SaveAI. In January 2012, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture asked the Ontario government to put a moratorium on all wind turbine projects until the health effects of this project and other issues have been properly assessed. In 2011 Senator Bob Runciman championed a motion which resulted in a unanimous vote for a moratorium on wind-farm development along eastern Lake Ontario until the impact on birds and bats can be studied. Such a moratorium would protect Important Bird Areas and the migratory flyways - Prince Edward County and Amherst Island were featured. No action was taken by either the Federal government or the Liberal Provincial government. In 2013 Amherst Island was voted one of Canada's Top Ten Endangered Places by the National Heritage Trust because of the threat of wind turbines to the cultural and natural heritage of this Island. The Trust continues to monitor the situation. In September 2015, Windlectric Inc., a power generation company based in Oakville, Ontario, agreed to invest CAD272.5 million (US$181.33 million) in the construction and development of Amherst island wind energy project. The total installed capacity will be 74.3 MW, from 26 wind turbine generators. The wind turbines were expected to commence commercial operations in fourth quarter of 2016 or first quarter of 2017 but actually became operational in early 2018.

Unlike assault, in which the fear of imminent contact may support a civil claim, battery involves an actual contact. The contact can be by one person (the tortfeasor) of another (the victim), with or without a weapon, or the contact may be by an object brought about by the tortfeasor. For example, the intentionally bringing a car into contact with another person, or the intentional striking of a person with a thrown rock, is a battery. Unlike criminal law, which recognizes degrees of various crimes involving physical contact, there is but a single tort of battery. Lightly flicking a person's ear is battery, as is severely beating someone with a tire iron. Neither is there a separate tort for a battery of a sexual nature. However, a jury hearing a battery case is free to assess higher damages for a battery in which the contact was particularly offensive or harmful. Since it is practically impossible to avoid physical contact with others during everyday activities, everyone is presumed to consent to a certain amount of physical contact with others, such as when one person unavoidably brushes or bumps against another in a crowded lift, passage or stairway. However, physical contact may not be deemed as consented to if the acts that cause harm are prohibited acts. McNamara v Duncan (1971) 26 ALR 584  General characteristics of battery  =Contact required= Battery is a form of trespass to the person and as such no actual damage (e.g. injury) needs to be proved. Only proof of contact (with the appropriate level of intention or negligence) needs to be made. An attempt to commit a battery, but without making actual contact, may constitute a tort of assault. The tort of battery developed out of a general judicial respect of an individual's autonomy and right not to be interfered with.Thomas Lundmark, Surgery by an Unauthorized Surgeon as a Battery, 10 J.L. & Health 287, 289 (1995-1996) Battery need not require body-to-body contact. Touching an object \\"intimately connected\\" to a person (such as an object he or she is holding) can also be battery.See, e.g. Fisher v Carrousel Motor Hotel, Inc., 424 S.W.2d 627 (1967). Furthermore, a contact may constitute a battery even if there is a delay between the defendant's act and the contact to the plaintiff's injury. For example, where a person who digs a pit with the intent that another will fall into it later, or where a person who mixes something offensive in food that he knows another will eat, has committed a battery against that other when the other does in fact fall into the pit or eats the offensive matter. = Character of intent = The character of intent in civil battery is different from that for criminal battery. The character of intent sufficient for battery also varies between common law countries, and often within differing jurisdictions of those countries. In Australia, negligence in an action is sufficient to establish intent. In the United States, intention to do an act that ultimately results in contact that is either harmful or offensive is sufficient for the tort of battery, while intention to inflict an injury on another is required for criminal battery. In the U.S., courts are split on how to test for sufficient intent. Some courts use the single intent rule which seeks to determine whether or not the defendant intended to touch the plaintiff, while some courts use the dual intent rule which seeks to determine whether or not the defendant sought to harm or offend by touching. Additionally, courts also follow the transferred intent doctrine in battery claims. For instance, if a person swings to hit one person and instead misses and hits another, they can still be held liable for a battery.Talmage v Smith, 101 Mich. 370, 59 N.W. 656 (Mich. 1894). Intent to commit a different tort can transfer in the same way.Nelson v. Carroll, 735 A.2d 1096 (Md. 1999) If a person throws a rock towards one person intending only to scare them (but not to hit them), they will be liable for battery to a different person who is hit by that rock.Id. at 374 In the United States, critics of this doctrine believe that the tort of negligence has superseded the need for transferred intent.Vincent R. Johnson, Transferred Intent in American Tort Law, 87 Marq. L. Rev. 903, 908 (2004). Available at: http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol87/iss5/2 One issue is that the statute of limitations can be shorter for intentional torts such as battery than the statutes of limitations for negligent torts.Dobbs, 55. = Awareness not required = The victim of a battery need not be aware of the act at the time for the tort to have occurred. For example, if a surgeon performing an appendectomy on an unconscious patient decides to take out the patient's spleen for his personal collection, the surgeon has committed a battery against the patient. Similarly, a battery occurs if the surgeon allows a cousin who is a plumber with no medical training to help fish out the appendix during the surgery. Although the patient has consented to being touched by the surgeon, this consent does not extend to people who the patient would not reasonably anticipate would be participating in the procedure. The battery may occur even if the victim is unaware of the contact at the time and the defendant is nowhere near the scene at the time of the contact. If a tortfeasor puts an offensive substance in another person's food, and the other person consumes the offensive substance, the battery has been committed even if the victim is not made aware that they have eaten something offensive until much later.  Battery by country  =United States= In the United States, the common law requires the contact for battery be \\"harmful or offensive.\\"Restatement (Third) of Torts: Intentional Torts to Persons ¬ß 101 (Am. Law Inst. 2015) The offensiveness is measured against a reasonable person standard. Looking at a contact objectively, as a reasonable person would see it, would this contact be offensive? Thus, a hypersensitive person would fail on a battery action if jostled by fellow passengers on a subway, as this contact is expected in normal society and a reasonable person would not find it offensive. Harmful is defined by any physical damage to the body. Because courts have recognized a cause of action for battery in the absence of body-to-body contact,See, e.g., Leichtman v. WLW Jacor Communications, 92 Ohio App.3d 232 (1994) (cause of action for battery where tortfeasor blew cigarette smoke in another's face). the outer limits of the tort can often be hard to define. The Pennsylvania Superior Court attempted to provide some guidance in this regard in Herr v. Booten580 A.2d 1115 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1990). by stressing the importance of the concept of one's personal dignity. In that case, college students purchased and provided their friend with alcohol on the eve of his twenty-first birthday. After drinking nearly an entire bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, the underage man died of acute ethanol poisoning. Reversing the decision of the trial court, the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that supplying a minor with alcoholic beverages, while certainly constituting a negligent act, did not rise to the level of a battery. In the words of Judge Montemuro, supplying a person with alcohol \\"is not an act which impinges upon that individual's sense of physical dignity or inviolability.\\"Id. at 1117. Defenses The standard defenses to trespass to the person, namely necessity, consent, self-defense, and defense of others, apply to battery. As practical examples, under the defense of necessity, a physician may touch a person without that person's consent in order to render medical aid to him or her in an emergency. Under the defense of consent, a person who has, either expressly or impliedly, consented to participation in a contact sport cannot claim in battery against other participants for a contact permitted by the rules of that sport, or expected to occur within the course of play. For example, a basketball player who commits a hard foul against an opposing player does not thereby commit a battery, because fouls are a regular part of the course of the game, even though they result in a penalty. However, a player who struck another player during a time-out would be liable for battery, because there is no game-related reason for such a contact to occur. Self-defense as to battery can occur when a person reasonably believes that he or she is going to be attacked by another person, and involves engaging in a reasonable level of physical contact with that person in order to prevent that person from engaging in a physical attack.

Compared to a missal, which carries all texts and readings read by the priest and others during Mass, a sacramentary omits the texts and readings said by everyone other than the priest, but also includes texts for services other than Mass. As the sacramentary presupposes that the celebrant is normally a bishop, it also usually supplies the texts for ordinations, at the consecration of a church and altar and many exorcisms, blessings, and consecrations that were later inserted in the Pontifical and Ritual.Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. Liturgical Books The sacramentary assumes the presence of a choir, deacon and subdeacon. At the time that these books were written it was not yet the custom for the celebrant to repeat at the altar whatever was sung by the ministers or the choir, as became the rule in the Tridentine Mass. Thus Sacramentaries contain none of those parts of the Mass such as Scripture readings, Introits, Graduals, Offertories and so on, and only included the prayers specific to the celebrant such as the Collects, Prefaces, and Canon. A number of versions of the texts for Sacramentaries, chiefly of the Roman Rite, are still extant, either complete or in part. Of these textual groups the most important are the three known by the names Leonine, Gelasian, and Gregorian. Their date, authorship, place, and original purpose have been much discussed. The name Sacramentarium is equivalent to the other form also used (for instance, in the Gelasian book), Liber Sacramentorum. The form is the same as that of the word Hymnarium, for a book of hymns. Gennadius of Massilia (fifth cent.) says of Paulinus of Nola: \\"Fecit et sacramentarium et hymnarium\\" (De viris illustribus, XLVIII). The word sacramentum or sacramenta in this case means the Mass. Sacramenta celebrare or facere is a common term for saying Mass.So St. Augustine (died 430) remarks that we say \\"Sursum corda\\" \\"in sacramentis fidelium\\", that is at Mass (De Dono Persev., xiii, 33), and two schismatics of the fifth century complain to the Emperors Gratian and Theodosius that Pope Damasus (366-84) will not let them say Mass; but they do so all the same, because \\"salutis nostr√¶ sacramenta facienda sunt\\" (Faustinus and Marcellinus, \\"Lib. prec. ad Imp.\\" in P. L., XIII, 98; cf. Probst, \\"Die √§ltesten r√∂m. Sakram.\\", 20-1). In the late twentieth century, the word sacramentary was also used in the United States and some other English- speaking countries for the English translation of the Roman Missal, even though these were missals and not true sacramentaries. Decline of the sacramentary A leaf from the Tyniec Sacramentary, National Library of Poland. Written for the Brauweiler Abbey, it was a kind of sanctuary for the palatines of Lotharingia. Other books used in the celebration of Mass included the Graduale (texts mainly from the Psalms, with musical notes added), the Evangeliarium or Gospel Book, and the Epistolary with texts from other parts of the New Testament, mainly the Epistles (letters) of Saint Paul. In late mediaeval times, these books began to be combined, for the use of priests saying Mass without the assistance of a choir and other ministers. This led to the appearance of the Missale plenum (\\"full or complete Missal\\") containing all the texts of the Mass (without the music of the choir parts). Pope Pius V published in 1570 an official version of such a Missal, known as the Roman Missal. At the behest of the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI greatly increased the amount of Sacred Scripture read at Mass and, to a lesser extent, the prayer formulas. This necessitated a return to having the readings in a separate book, known as the Lectionary. A separate Book of the Gospels, with texts extracted from the Lectionary, is recommended, but is not obligatory. The Roman Missal continues to include elaborate rubrics, as well as antiphons etc., which were not in sacramentaries.  Textual groups  Of the textual groups of sacramentaries of the Roman Rite still extant, either complete or in part, the most important are the three known by the names Leonine, Gelasian, and Gregorian. =The Leonine Sacramentary= The \\"Leonine Sacramentary\\" is the oldest. Only one manuscript of it is known, written in the seventh century. This manuscript was found in the library of the cathedral chapter of Verona, was published by Joseph Bianchini in 1735, and was by him attributed arbitrarily to Pope Leo I (440-61). On the strength of this attribution the book still bears the name Leonine. It represents a pure Roman use with no Gallican elements. But it is not a book compiled for use at the altar. The confusion of its parts shows this. It is a fragment, containing no Canon nor Ordinary of the Mass, but a collection of Propers (Collects, Secrets, Prefaces, Postcommunions, and Orationes super populum), of various Masses with ordination forms, arranged according to the civil year. It begins in the middle of the sixth Mass for April, and ends with a blessing for the font \\"In ieiunio mensis decimi\\" (i. e. the winter Ember days). In each month groups of Masses are given, often very large groups, for each feast and occasion. Thus, for instance, in June we find twenty-eight Masses for St Peter and St Paul, one after another, each headed: \\"Item alia\\"; there are fourteen for St Lawrence, twenty-three for the anniversary of a bishop's consecration, and so on. Evidently the writer has compiled as many alternative Masses for each occasion as he could find. In many cases he shows carelessness. Many of his Masses in natali episcoporum have nothing at all to do with that anniversary, and are really Masses for Sundays after Pentecost; in the middle of a Mass of St Cornelius and St Cyprian he has put the preface of a Mass of St Euphemia, a Mass for the new civil year is inserted among those for martyrs; Masses for St Stephen's day (26 December) with evident allusions to Christmas are put in August, obviously through a confusion with the feast of the finding of his relics (3 August). That the collection is Roman is obvious. It is full of local allusions to Rome. For instance, one of the collects to be said by a bishop on the anniversary of his consecration could only be used by the pope of Rome: \\"Lord God ... who, although Thou dost not cease to enrich with many gifts Thy Church spread throughout the world, nevertheless dost look more favourably upon the see of Thy blessed Apostle Peter, as Thou hast desired that it should be most exalted, etc.\\" The Preface for St John and St Paul remembers that they are buried within \\"the boundaries of this city\\"; the Masses of the Patrons of Rome, St Peter and St Paul, continually allude to the city. Louis Duchesne concluded that the Leonine book is a private collection of prayers copied without much intelligence from the official books at Rome about the year 538. He arrives at this date especially through an allusion in the Secret of a Mass placed in June (but really an Easter Mass), which refers to a recent deliverance from enemies. This allusion he understands to refer to the raising of the siege of Rome by Vitiges and his Goths at Easter-time, 538. Another writer attributed the allusion to Alaric's invasion in 402, and held that the compilation was made between 366 and 461. Another considered that the book was composed under Pope Felix III (483-492). Yet another suggests that the book is a compilation of Roman Masses made in the sixth or seventh century for use in Gaul, so that the composers of Roman books who were at that time introducing the Roman Rite into Gaul might have a source from which to draw their material. He suggests Gregory of Tours (died 594) as possibly the compiler. = The Gelasian Sacramentary = The \\"Gelasian Sacramentary\\" exists in several manuscripts. It is a Roman book more or less Gallicanized; the various manuscripts represent different stages of this Gallican influence. The oldest form extant is a book now in the Vatican library written in the seventh or early eighth century for use in the abbey of St Denis at Paris. Other versions of the same book are the Codices of St Gall and of Rheinau, both of the eighth century. The book does not in any old manuscript bear the name of Gelasius; it is called simply Liber Sacramentorum Roman√¶ ecclesi√¶. It is much more complete than the Leonine Sacramentary. It consists of three books, each marked with a not very accurate title. Book I (The Book of Sacraments in the order of the year's cycle) contains Masses for feasts and Sundays from Christmas Eve to the octave of Pentecost (there are as yet no special Masses for the season after Pentecost), together with the ordinations, prayers for all the rites of the catechumenate, blessing of the font at the Easter Vigil, of the oil, dedication of churches, and reception of nuns. Book II (Prayers for the Feasts of Saints) contains the Proper of Saints throughout the year, the Common of Saints, and the Advent Masses. Book III (Prayers and the Canon for Sundays) contains a great number of Masses marked simply \\"For Sunday\\" (i. e. any Sunday), the Canon of the Mass, what we should call votive Masses (e. g. for travellers, in time of trouble, for kings, and so on), Masses for the Dead, some blessings (of holy water, fruits, trees and so on), and various prayers for special occasions. A ninth-century tradition ascribes what is evidently this book to Pope Gelasius I. Duchesne thinks it represents the Roman service-books of the seventh or eighth century (between the years 628 and 731). It was, however, composed in the Frankish kingdom. All the local Roman allusions (for instance, the Roman Stations) have been omitted; on Good Friday the prayers read: \\"Let us pray for our most Christian Emperor [the compiler has added] or king\\", and again: \\"look down mercifully on the Roman, or the Frankish, Empire\\". There are also Gallican additions. Others ascribe it to the sixth century, at which time the Roman Rite entered Gaul. = The Gregorian Sacramentary = We know most about the third of these books, the so-called \\"Gregorian Sacramentary\\", which is in three parts: # The Ordinary of the Mass; # the Propers for the year beginning with Christmas Eve. They follow the ecclesiastical year; the feasts of saints (days of the month in the civil year) are incorporated in their approximate places in this. The Roman Stations are noted. There are still no Masses for the Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost; # the prayers for ordinations. Charlemagne, anxious to introduce the Roman Rite into his kingdom, wrote to Pope Adrian I between the years 781 and 791 asking him to send him the service-book of the Roman Church. The book sent by the pope is the nucleus of the Gregorian Sacramentary. It was then copied a great number of times, so that there are many versions of it, all containing additions made by the various scribes. The original book sent by Adrian to Charlemagne is easily distinguished from the different editions because the first to supplement Adrian's book from other sources was a conscientious person who carefully noted where his additions begin, adding a note: \\"So far the preceding book of Sacraments is certainly that edited by the holy Pope Gregory.\\" In the earlier versions we may take the first part, down to this note, as being the book sent by Adrian. However, its attribution to Pope Gregory I (590-604) shows us that Gregory did much to reform the liturgy. A constant tradition ascribes such a work to him, as to Gelasius. John the Deacon (eighth century) in his Life of Gregory expresses this tradition: \\"He collected the Sacramentary of Gelasius in one book, leaving out much, changing little, adding something.\\" Pope Adrian himself, in sending the book to Charlemagne, said that it was composed \\"by our holy predecessor, the divinely speaking Pope Gregory\\". The fact that the essential foundation of this sacramentary goes back to St Gregory, indeed to long before his time, is certain. We do not doubt that he made such changes as those that are acclaimed to him by his biographer, and that these changes stand in this book. But his work has not remained untouched, additions have been made to it since his time. For example, the addition of his own feast as well as other feasts that had not been celebrated before the seventh century. The book sent by Pope Adrian to Charlemagne has gone through inevitable development over the centuries since Gregory finished it. It represents the Roman Rite of the time when it was sent - the eighth century. In the Frankish kingdom, copies were made for churches and additions of other Masses and prayers were added according to the specific church's requests. These additions were taken partly from the Gelasian book, partly from Gallican sources. Though at first the additions were carefully distinguished from the original book, they were eventually incorporated in it. Between the ninth and eleventh centuries the book, including the additions, returned to Rome, took the place of the original pure Roman Rite, and so became the foundation of the Roman Missal.

Another theory is that the name simply means something like \\"Home of Bartels\\", as Hiem is old Dutch for home (compare 'heim' in German).  Elfstedentocht  Bartlehiem is especially well-known due to the Elfstedentocht for ice skaters, who have to pass through the hamlet twice. Coming from the west from Feinsum through the Feinsumer Feart, a wide ditch. Skaters then pass the famous wooden bicycle and pedestrian bridge of Bartlehiem, after the bridge they skate north over the Dokkumer Ie to Dokkum. On return they turn left to the east over the Aldtsjerkster Feart, a similar ditch. From here it is approx 10 km to the finish line on the Bonkefeart in Leeuwarden. Due to this, Bartlehiem is the only place where a spectator can see Elfstedentocht-participants from three directions.

Originally named Festival Disney, it opened on April 12, 1992, covering an area of approximately inside what was then known as Euro Disney Resort. Based on Walt Disney World's Disney Village Marketplace (now Disney Springs), Disney Village was designed by architect Frank Gehry with towers of oxidized silver and bronze-colored stainless steel under a canopy of lights. It is adjacent to the two theme parks of Disneyland Paris and the Lake Buena Vista hotel area. History =Original concept= The Festival Disney logo Disney specified that the primary focus of the new facility should be entertainment. It was envisioned as an attraction inside of the Euro Disney Resort, as well as a free transitional space for visitors of the Euro Disneyland theme park and train passengers from the RER/TGV train station traveling to the resort hotels. The space would include numerous shops, bars, concerts, shows, and nightclubs. The original concept was a large, open space full of life and music. It would be lit from all sides around a central avenue and include a starry sky as its crowning feature. The columns that would support this sky would be the remnants of an old power station, which had been left standing after the site had been converted. Gehry noted: =Changes and alterations= Although the starry sky was generally well-received, the same could not be said for many other aspects of Festival Disney. From the beginning, guests and cast members alike criticized the project, perceiving it as having a cold, industrial, and soulless atmosphere. As a result, many changes were made to Gehry's original concept. Metal frames that had been placed on many of the pylons were removed and replaced with statues and food counters. In 1996, just four years after opening, Festival Disney was renamed Disney Village. Popular restaurant chain Planet Hollywood opened in front of the Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Show building, and the following year an eight-screen Gaumont multiplex cinema complex opened next door to Planet Hollywood, blocking the Wild West Show's original entrance. Many changes and adjustments took place in existing buildings over the next 10 years, such as the opening of Caf√© Mickey in 2002 (replacing the Los Angeles Bar & Grill), the opening of King Ludwig's Castle in 2003 (replacing Rock 'n' Roll America), and the opening of the Rainforest Caf√© in 1999 (replacing Key West). On January 25, 1999, a large McDonald's fast food restaurant opened with a theme based on Italy's Commedia dell'arte. Later in 2004, a 570-seat IMAX cinema opened as part of the Gaumont multiplex. Finally, on December 3, 2004, an Art Deco themed multi-story parking structure called VINCI Park (now Indigo) opened. In 2004, the resort management team began renovations that would take several years to complete. The neon lights, oversized signs, and central stage were all removed from the main area. Colorfully lit balloons were added to the remaining columns for nighttime lighting. PanoraMagique, one of the largest captive balloons in the world, opened in April 2005. It carries up to 30 passengers into the sky. In 2008, resort management added large planters that contained trees, hedges, and flowers to the main thoroughfare. Terraces were added to restaurants and caf√©s, and the facades of buildings were updated. In the same year, a new beverage stand/snack bar was added near the entrance to Disney Village, and the tourist kiosk nearby was rebuilt in more of a neo-industrial Parisian style. In 2009, the Buffalo Trading Company closed and the premises are now occupied by a Starbucks coffee house. As part of a ‚Ç¨2 billion expansion of the Disneyland Resort, it has been confirmed that Disney Village will receive an overhaul and potential expansion. Further details have not yet been confirmed.

Major areas of law ‚Äì particularly administrative law, contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law ‚Äì are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes. However, other areas of law, such as criminal law, company law and family law, are almost completely statutory in nature. Apart from referring to relevant Singaporean cases, judges continue to refer to English case law where the issues pertain to a traditional common-law area of law, or involve the interpretation of Singaporean statutes based on English enactments or English statutes applicable in Singapore. These days, there is also a greater tendency to consider decisions of important Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada, particularly if they take a different approach from English law. Certain Singapore statutes are not based on English enactments but on legislation from other jurisdictions. In such situations, court decisions from those jurisdictions on the original legislation are often examined. Thus, Indian law is sometimes consulted in the interpretation of the and the which were based on Indian statutes. On the other hand, where the interpretation of the is concerned, courts remain reluctant to take into account foreign legal materials on the basis that a constitution should primarily be interpreted within its own four walls rather than in the light of analogies from other jurisdictions; and because economic, political, social and other conditions in foreign countries are perceived as different. Certain laws such as the (which authorises detention without trial in certain circumstances) and the (which regulates the formation of associations) that were enacted during British rule in Singapore remain in the statute book, and both corporal and capital punishment are still in use. History =Before 1826= Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles (6 July 1781 ‚Äì 5 July 1826) Modern Singapore was founded on 6 February 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles, an officer of the British East India Company and Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, in an attempt to counter Dutch domination of trade in the East. Permission for the East India Company to set up a \\"factory\\" on the island was obtained from the Sultan of Johor and Temenggung of Johor on that date, and outright cession of Singapore took place in 1824. It has been suggested that prior to British acquisition of the island, the Malay chief in charge of Singapore was the Temenggung of Johor. The Johor Sultanate was the successor of the Malacca Sultanate, both of which had their own codes of law. It is also possible that adat law, often inadequately translated as \\"customary law\\", governed the inhabitants of the island prior to its acquisition by the British. However, little, if anything, is known about the laws that were actually applicable. The British have always assumed that no law prevailed on the island of Singapore when it was acquired. In 1823 Raffles promulgated \\"Regulations\\" for the administration of the island. Regulation III of 20 January 1823 established a magistracy which had jurisdiction over \\"all descriptions of persons resorting under the British flag\\". The magistrates were enjoined to \\"follow the course of the British magistracy, as far as local circumstances permit, avoiding technicalities and unnecessary forms as much as possible, and executing the duties of their office with temper and discretion, according to the best of their judgement and conscience and the principles of substantial justice\\". Raffles' Regulations were most likely illegal as he was acting beyond the scope of his legal powers in making them ‚Äì although he had power to place the factory at Singapore under the jurisdiction of Bencoolen, he was not vested with power to place the entire island under Bencoolen's control. In this respect, he had treated Singapore as if the entire island had been ceded to the British when the Treaty with the Sultan and the Temenggung had only permitted the establishment of a trading factory.. The same year, Raffles appointed John Crawfurd as Resident of Singapore. Crawfurd doubted the legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a Court of Requests overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident's Court hearing all other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on \\"general principles of English law\\", taking into account so far as he could the \\"character and manners of the different classes\\" of local inhabitants., cited in . Unfortunately, Crawfurd's courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, all he could do was to banish them from the island.Chionh, pp. 97‚Äì98. Despite the dubious legal status of the courts established in Singapore by Raffles and Crawfurd, they indicate that the de facto position was that between 1819 and 1826 English legal principles applied to Singapore.. On 24 June 1824 Singapore and Malacca were formally transferred to the East India Company's administration by the Transfer of Singapore to East India Company, etc. Act 1824.5 Geo. IV c. 108 (UK). By virtue of the Fort Marlborough in India Act 180242 Geo. III c. 29 (UK). both territories, together with others in the region ceded to Britain by the Netherlands, became subordinate to the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal, and under the Government of India Act 180039 & 40 Geo. III c. 79 (UK). these territories became subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Fort William. The Indian Salaries and Pensions Act 18256 Geo. IV c. 85 (UK). authorised the East India Company to place Singapore and Malacca under the administration of Prince of Wales' Island (now Penang). The Company did so, thus creating the Straits Settlements.. =1826‚Äì1867: The \\"Indian period\\"= The East India House, the headquarters of the East India Company, in Leadenhall Street, London, as seen c. 1817; it was demolished in 1869. The statute 6 Geo. IV c. 85 empowered the British Crown to issue letters patent providing for the administration of justice in the Straits Settlements. The East India Company petitioned the Crown for the grant of such letters patent establishing \\"such Courts and Judicatures for the due administration of Justice and the security of the persons rights and property of the Inhabitants and the Public Revenue of and the Trial and Punishment of Capital and other Offences committed and the repression of vice within the said Settlement of Prince of Wales‚Äô Island Singapore and Malacca‚Ä¶\\" Granting the petition, the Crown issued the Second Charter of Justice on 27 November 1826.The First Charter of Justice of 1807 applied only to Prince of Wales' Island (Penang). The Charter established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca, which was conferred \\"full Power and Authority‚Ä¶ to give and pass Judgement and Sentence according to Justice and Right\\". This key clause was later judicially interpreted to have introduced English law into the Straits Settlements. The present understanding of this clause is that it made all English statutes and principles of English common law and equity in force as at 27 November 1826 applicable in the Straits Settlements (including Singapore), unless they were both unsuitable to local conditions and could not be modified to avoid causing injustice or oppression.. The Charter provided that the Court of Judicature was to be presided over by the Governor of the Straits Settlements and Resident Councillor of the settlement where the court was to be held, and another judge called the Recorder. Problems occurred with the first Recorder, Sir John Thomas Claridge. He complained that the Governor and Resident Councillors had refused to take any judicial business, and so responded by also refusing to take on the full business of the Court. He also bemoaned the lack of a \\"full, efficient and respectable court establishment of clerks, interpreters. etc.\\" Although expected to travel from his base at Prince of Wales' Island to Singapore and Malacca, due to disputes over travelling expenses and arrangements, Claridge refused to do so. Thus, on 22 May 1828 the Governor Robert Fullerton, together with the Resident Councillor Kenneth Murchison, were obliged to hold the first assizes in Singapore by themselves. Claridge was eventually recalled to the UK in 1829.Chionh, pp. 99‚Äì100. The title page of the Second Charter of Justice of 27 November 1826, from the edition published in London by J.L. Cox in February 1827. This copy of the Charter was originally owned by the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, and a photocopy of it is presently in the collection of the Library of the Supreme Court of Singapore. The Charter conferred no legislative power on the Governor and Council of Prince of Wales' Island or, indeed, on any other individual or institution.Bartholomew, p. xxxiii. The general power to make laws was vested with the Supreme Government of India and the British Parliament.Tan, p. 11. By the East India Company Act 1813 (also known as the Charter Act 1813),53 Geo. III c. 155 (UK) Prince of Wales' Island itself had been conferred an extremely limited power to issue regulations relating to duties and taxes it was empowered to levy; pursuant to this power, it issued nine regulations that applied to the Straits Settlements.Bartholomew, p. xxxiv. However, on 20 June 1830 the East India Company reduced the status of Prince of Wales' Island from a Presidency to a Residency.Bartholomew, p. xxxv. The island thus lost power to legislate for the Straits Settlements, which power was assumed by the Governor General of Bengal. He issued four such regulations applicable to the Straits Settlements.Bartholomew, p. xxxvii. Upon the downgrading of the Straits Settlements, the offices of Governor and Resident Councillors were abolished. This led Governor Fullerton to conclude that neither he nor the Resident Councillors were empowered any longer to administer justice under the Second Charter. In late 1830, Fullerton closed the courts and dismissed the judicial establishment before leaving for England. This led to legal chaos. Members of the mercantile community were in an uproar as they felt the ensuing confusion and inconvenience of having no local courts would disrupt commercial activity. In Singapore the Deputy Resident Murchison felt compelled to convene a court. However, the Acting Registrar James LochIt is not known whether this is the same person as the James Loch (1780‚Äì1855), a Scottish estate commissioner and a Member of Parliament. took the view that the court was illegal, and it was soon closed again. In September 1831 merchants of the Straits Settlements appealed to the British Parliament. By then, the East India Company had already decided that Fullerton had been mistaken. It decided to restore the titles of Governor and Resident Councillor so that these officers could continue to administer justice pursuant to the Charter. On 9 June 1832 the Court of Judicature reopened at Prince of Wales' Island, and disposed of many outstanding cases that had amassed during the two years when the courts were closed.Chionh, pp. 100‚Äì101. In 1833, the Government of India Act 1833 (also known as the Charter Act 1833)3 & 4 Will. IV, c. 85 (UK). was passed by the British Parliament for the better government of the East India Company's possessions. Sole legislative power was transferred to the Governor General of India in Council, thus inaugurating the period of Straits Settlements history known as the period of the \\"Indian Acts\\".Bartholomew, p. xxxix. The Court of Judicature was reorganised by the Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855. The Straits Settlements now had two Recorders, one for Prince of Wales' Island, the other for Singapore and Malacca.Chionh, p. 103. In 1858 the East India Company was abolished, and territories formerly administered by the Company were transferred to the Crown acting through the recently appointed Secretary of State for India. This was effected by the Government of India Act 1858.21 & 22 Vic. c. 106 (UK). There was no change to the structure of the legal system ‚Äì the Governor General of India continued to legislate for the Straits Settlements.Bartholomew, p. xlvi. Unfortunately, many Acts passed by the Governor General during this period were not relevant to the Straits Settlements, and it was difficult to determine which were applicable. The situation was remedied by the passing of the Statute Law Revision Ordinance 1889 (No. 8 of 1889) (Ind.), which appointed commissioners to inquire into the matter and empowered them to publish a volume containing the text of any Indian Acts considered in force. Any Acts not included ceased to be applicable forthwith.Bartholomew, p. xl. =1867‚Äì1942: The Straits Settlements as a Crown colony= On 1 April 1867, the Straits Settlements were detached from India and constituted as a separate Crown colony by way of the Straits Settlements Act 1866.29 & 30 Vic. c. 115 (UK): Bartholomew, p. xlvi. A separate Legislative Council with the authority to make laws was set up for the Straits Settlements. Pieces of legislation passed by the Legislative Council were known as \\"ordinances\\".Bartholomew, p. xlvii. By the Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 (S.S.),Ordinance No. 5 of 1868 (S.S.). the Court of Judicature of the Straits Settlements was abolished, and in its place the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was established. The GovernorBy the Judicial Duties Act (No. 3 of 1867) (S.S.). and Resident CouncillorsBy the Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 (No. 5 of 1868) (S.S.). ceased to be judges of the Court. In 1873, the Supreme Court was reconstituted to consist of the Chief Justice and the Judge at Penang as well as a Senior and a Junior Puisne Judge. There were two divisions of the court, one at Singapore and Malacca and the other at Penang. As Singapore had become the Straits Settlements' centre of government and trade, the Chief Justice and Senior Puisne Judge were required to reside in Singapore, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior Puisne Judge resided in Penang. The Supreme Court was also conferred with jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal in civil matters. Following changes in the court structure in England, in 1878 the jurisdiction and residence of judges was made more flexible, thus impliedly abolishing the geographical division of the Supreme Court.Tan, p. 18. The first hierarchy of courts was also established, consisting of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, Courts of Request, Courts of Two Magistrates, Magistrates' Courts, Coroners' Courts and Justices of the Peace. Appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court lay in the first instance to the Court of Appeal, and then to Her Majesty in Council, the latter appeals being heard by the Judicial Committee of Her Britannic Majesty's Privy Council.The 1878 reforms were effected by the Courts Ordinance 1878 (No. 3 of 1878) (S.S.). Also in 1878, a provision later known as section 5 of the Civil Law Act. was introduced into Straits Settlements law.By the Civil Law Ordinance 1878 (No. 4 of 1878) (S.S.). The provision stated that if a question or issue arose locally with respect to certain named categories of law or with respect to mercantile law generally, the law to be administered was to be the same as that administered in England at the corresponding period, unless other provision had been made by any law having force locally. It was felt the provision was needed because the Straits Settlements Supreme Court had a tendency to follow English case law premised on the existence of statutes that were not in force in the Colony. There was also a general sentiment that the common law should be common to the whole Empire.. However, the manner in which section 5 was worded created much difficulty in determining whether particular English statutes applied locally.See, generally, Woon, pp. 142‚Äì153; and Phang, pp. 27‚Äì35. Despite major amendments to the provision in 1979,By the Civil Law (Amendment No. 2) Act 1979 (No. 24 of 1979). the problems with it were not resolved until it was finally repealed in 1993 (see below). Under the Courts Ordinance Amendment 1885 (S.S.),Ordinance No. 15 of 1885 (S.S.) the set-up of the Supreme Court was again altered so that it now consisted of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges.Chionh, pp. 104‚Äì106. In 1907 the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was given a major overhaul.By the Courts Ordinance 1907 (No. 30 of 1907) (S.S.). The Court was split into two divisions ‚Äì a Civil Division and a Criminal Division, each with both original and appellate jurisdiction. District Courts and Police Courts, which replaced the Magistrates' Courts, were also established. The Court of Requests, the jurisdiction of which had been drastically reduced in the intervening years, was abolished.Chionh, pp. 106‚Äì107. The last major changes in the court system before World War II took place in 1934 when a Court of Criminal Appeal, essentially an extension of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, was created,By way of the Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance 1931 (No. 5 of 1931) (S.S.): Tan, p. 19. and in 1936 when it was declared that the Supreme Court would consist of a High Court and Court of Appeal.By the Courts Ordinance (Cap. 10, 1936 Rev. Ed.) (S.S.). =1942‚Äì1946: Singapore under Japanese and British Military Administration= Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita (seated, left of centre) of the Japanese Imperial Army thumps the table with his fist to emphasise his terms ‚Äì unconditional surrender of Singapore. Lt.-Gen. Arthur Percival, General Officer Commanding (Malaya) of the British Army (right, back to camera) sits between his officers, his clenched hand to his mouth. During World War II, Singapore fell under Japanese Military Administration on 15 February 1942. There is much confusion as to where legislative authority lay, as there were several government or military bodies which had the power to make laws. These were, in order of descending authority, the Supreme Command of the Southern Army Headquarters, the 25th Army Headquarters, the Military Administration Department, the Malay (Malayan) Military Administration Headquarters, and the City Government of Tokubetu-si. Numerous regulations, laws and notices were issued by all these bodies through the Tokubetu-si without adhering to the normal chain of command. Although these laws were often contradictory, the body higher in the hierarchy always prevailed. When the Japanese occupation of Singapore began, all existing courts ceased to function. By a decree of 7 April 1942, a Military Court of Justice of the Nippon Army was established, and the civil courts were reopened by a proclamation dated 27 May. This Proclamation made all former British laws applicable so long as they did not interfere with the Military Administration. The highest court was the Syonan Koto-Hoin (Syonan Supreme Court) which was opened on 29 May. Although a court of appeal was constituted, it never sat.Tan, p. 20. There is some disagreement as to the status of judgments handed down by courts during the Japanese Occupation. The view has been taken by some post-Occupation courts that decisions by Japanese tribunals applying the law were valid. Others have held that since the Japanese administration did not set up tribunals in compliance with the requirements of Straits Settlements law, while the law continued to apply there were no proper courts in existence to enforce it.Bartholomew, pp. lxviii‚Äìlxix. The Japanese surrendered on 12 September 1945. By Proclamation No. 1 (1945), the Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia established the British Military Administration which assumed full judicial, legislative, executive and administrative powers and responsibilities and conclusive jurisdiction over all persons and property throughout such areas of Malaya as were at any given time under the control of forces under his command.Bartholomew, p. lxix. The proclamation also declared that all laws and customs existing immediately prior to the Japanese Occupation would be respected, except that such of the existing law as the Chief Civil Affairs Officer considered practicable to administer during the period of military administration. Otherwise, all proclamations and legislative enactments of whatever kind issued by or under the authority of the Japanese Military Administration ceased to have effect.Bartholomew, p. lxx. By Proclamation No. 23 (1945), the Deputy Chief Civil Affairs Officer for the Singapore Division provided that every conviction of any offence by a tribunal established by the Japanese Military Administration was quashed, and any judgment convicting or purporting to convict any person or any offence was set aside. Civil proceedings were dealt with by the Japanese Judgements and Civil Proceedings Ordinance 1946 (No. 3 of 1946), which had the effect of permitting post-Occupation courts to review the decrees of Japanese tribunals and to confirm, modify or reverse them.Bartholomew, p. lxxi. =1946‚Äì1963: The end of the Straits Settlements: Singapore as a separate colony and self-governing state= The British Military Administration was terminated by Proclamation No. 77 (1946) dated 18 March 1946, and with effect from 1 April, the Straits Settlements were disbanded by the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act 1946.9 & 10 Geo. VI c. 37 (UK). By the Singapore Colony Order in Council 1946,S.R. & O. 1946 No. 464 (UK) Singapore was constituted as a new colony under the British Settlements Acts 1887.50 & 51 Vic. c. 54 (UK). A Singapore Legislative Council was created with power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Colony.Bartholomew, pp. lxxxi‚Äìlxxxii. The High Court and Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements became the Colony of Singapore High Court and Court of Appeal. In 1958 Singapore was granted internal self-government and became the State of Singapore. This change was put into place by the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council 1958S.I. 1958 No. 1946 (UK). made under powers conferred by the State of Singapore Act 1958.6 & 7 Eliz. II c. 59 (UK): Bartholomew, p. lxxiv. The Legislative Council was transformed into a Legislative Assembly consisting mainly of elected members. During this period, the basic structure of the courts remained much as it had been in the pre-war colonial era, with only minor changes being made such as the redesignation of the Police Courts as Magistrates' Courts in 1955.By way of the Courts Ordinance 1955 (No. 14 of 1955, later Cap. 3, 1955 Rev. Ed.): Chionh, p. 113. =1963‚Äì1965: Independence from the British Empire and merger with Malaysia= Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, and thus ceased to be a colony of the British empire. The legal arrangements were effected by the enactment of the Malaysia Act 1963 (UK),c. 35 (UK). the Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (State Constitutions) Order in Council 1963S.I. 1963 No. 1493 (UK). and the Malaysia Act 1963 (Malaysia).No. 26 of 1963 (M'sia): Bartholomew, p. lxxvi. The 1963 Order in Council provided that all laws in force in Singapore continued to apply subject to modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions that might be necessary to bring them into conformity with its new Constitution and the Malaysia Act.Bartholomew, p. lxxvii. With Singapore now a state in a larger federation, the Singapore Legislative Assembly was transformed into the Legislature of Singapore with power to make laws only regarding certain matters set out in the Malaysian Federal Constitution. Article 75 of the Federal Constitution also stated: \\"If any state law is inconsistent with a federal law, the federal law shall prevail and the state law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.\\" During this period, a substantial number of Malaysian laws, including Federated Malay States Enactments and Malayan Union and Federation of Malaya Ordinances, were extended to Singapore. Some of these statutes continue to apply, often in modified form, in Singapore today.Bartholomew, p. lxxix. Under the Malaysia Act 1963, the judicial power of Malaysia was vested in a Federal Court, a High Court in Malaya, a High Court in Borneo and a High Court in Singapore. This new structure was officialised with effect from 16 March 1964 through the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (M'sia),No. 7 of 1964 (M'sia), reprinted as Act No. 6 of 1966 in the Singapore Reprints Supplement (Acts). which replaced the Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore with the High Court of Malaysia in Singapore.Tan, p. 30. The jurisdiction of the High Court in Singapore was limited to all territory in the State of Singapore.Chionh, p. 113. =1965 to the present: Singapore as a fully independent nation= Parliament House, Singapore, which was officially opened on 4 October 1999 Merger with Malaysia did not last: within two years, on 9 August 1965, Singapore was expelled from the Federation and became a fully independent republic. This was effected by the signing of the Independence of Singapore Agreement of 7 August 1965 by Singapore and Malaysia, and the changes consequent to the Agreement were implemented by two Malaysian Acts, the Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965No. 31 of 1965 (M'sia). and the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1966;No. 59 of 1966 (M'sia). and by two Singapore Acts, the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965No. 8 of 1965 (S'pore). and the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965.No. 9 of 1965 (S'pore). Section 5 of the latter Act provided that the legislative powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the supreme ruler of Malaysia, ceased to extend to Singapore, and vested instead in the Head of State (that is, the President of Singapore) and the Legislature of Singapore. Again, all laws were expressed to continue in force with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as might be necessary to bring them into conformity with the independent status of Singapore upon separation from Malaysia.Bartholomew, pp. lxxix‚Äìlxxx. Today, the Parliament of Singapore is an organ of state with plenary power to enact legislation for Singapore. At the time of independence, the Singapore Parliament did not make any changes to the judicial system. Thus, for an anomalous four-year period, the High Court in Singapore remained part of the Malaysian court structure. This was remedied in 1969, when the Constitution was amended to establish the Supreme Court of Singapore replacing the Federal Court of Malaysia with respect to Singapore, while retaining the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London as Singapore's court of final appeal.By the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1969 (No. 19 of 1969): Tan, pp. 30 and 32. The Supreme Court was divided into two divisions: the upper division consisted of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal, which respectively dealt with civil and criminal matters; the lower division being the High Court of Singapore.Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (No. 24 of 1969), now . Supreme Court Building, designed by Foster & Partners, which commenced operations on 20 June 2005, as it appeared in August 2006 In 1970 the subordinate courts were re-organised.By the Subordinate Courts Act 1970 (No. 19 of 1970), now . Since that time, the Subordinate Courts of Singapore have consisted of the District Courts, the Magistrates' Courts, the Juvenile Courts and the Coroners' Courts.Chionh, pp. 114‚Äì115. The Subordinate Courts were renamed the State Courts of Singapore on 7 March 2014. Steps to restrict appeals to the Privy Council were first taken in 1989. In that year, the law was changedBy the Judicial Committee (Amendment) Act 1989 (No. 21 of 1989). such that appeals to the Privy Council would only be permitted in a civil case if all the parties agreed to such an appeal prior to the hearing of the case by the Court of Appeal. In criminal cases, an appeal to the Privy Council could only be taken if the death penalty was involved and if the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal were not unanimous in their decision. These changes came shortly after the Privy Council restored a prominent opposition Member of Parliament, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, to the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore after he had been struck off for a criminal conviction for making false statements in a statutory declaration; the court described the conviction as \\"a grievous injustice\\".Jeyaretnam v. Law Society of Singapore [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 470 at 489, para. 59, [1988] UKPC 25, [1989] A.C. 608 at 631, Privy Council (on appeal from Singapore); see also . In 1993, the previous set-up of a separate Court of Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal was done away with, and in their place a unified Court of Appeal was constituted for both civil and criminal appeals.By the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 1993 (No. 16 of 1993). Judges of Appeal appointed to the Court of Appeal were no longer required to engage in High Court work. The Chief Justice sat as the President of the Court of Appeal. The establishment of the permanent Court of Appeal paved the way for the abolition of all appeals to the Privy Council with effect from 8 April 1994.The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1994 (No. 5 of 1994) repealed Art. 100 of the Constitution, which had provided that the President could make arrangements with Her Majesty for reference to the Privy Council of appeals from the Supreme Court. The Judicial Committee Act 1966 (No. 37 of 1966, later , which regulated the procedure for such appeals, was repealed by the Judicial Committee (Repeal) Act 1994 (No. 2 of 1994). Following this, the Court of Appeal issued a Practice Statement dated 11 July 1994, stating that while the Court would treat its own prior decisions and those of the Privy Council as normally binding, where it appeared that adherence to such decisions \\"would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore\\" it would regard itself as free to depart from such decisions. It added that this power would be exercised sparingly, bearing in mind the danger of retrospectively disturbing contractual, proprietary and other legal rights.Chionh, pp. 116‚Äì117. Today, the Court of Appeal of Singapore is the highest court in the land. The independent status of Singapore's legal system was underlined by the repeal of section 5 of the Civil Law Act (see above) on 12 November 1993 by the Application of English Law Act 1993.No. 35 of 1993, now . The Act aims to clarify the extent of the application of English law in Singapore. It states that the common law of England (including the principles and rules of equity), so far as it was part of the law of Singapore immediately before the commencement of the Act, continues to be part of Singapore law so far as it is applicable to the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants and subject to such modifications as those circumstances may require.Application of English Law Act, s. 3. As for English statutes, only those that are listed in the Schedules to the Act apply or continue to apply in Singapore; no other English enactment is part of Singapore law.Application of English Law Act, ss. 4 and 5. See, generally, Phang, pp. 37‚Äì49. Sources of law The Statutes of the Republic of Singapore, a series that consists of all Acts of the Singapore Parliament and English statutes that are currently in force in Singapore Generally, Singapore has three sources of law: legislation, judicial precedents (case law), and custom.See, generally, ch. 6 of . =Legislation= Legislation, or statutory law, can be divided into statutes and subsidiary legislation. Statutes are written laws enacted by the Singapore Parliament, as well as by other bodies such as the British Parliament, Governor-General of India in Council and Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements which had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past. Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been repealed. One particularly important statute is the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore,The current version is the 1999 Reprint. which is the supreme law of Singapore ‚Äì any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of the Constitution which is inconsistent with it is, to the extent of the inconsistency, void.Constitution, Art. 4. Statutes of the Singapore Parliament, as well as English statutes in force in Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act 1993. (see above), are published in looseleaf form in a series called the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore which is gathered in red binders, and are also accessible on-line from Singapore Statutes Online, a free service provided by the Attorney-General's Chambers of Singapore. Subsidiary legislation, also known as \\"delegated legislation\\" or \\"subordinate legislation\\", is written law made by ministers or other administrative agencies such as government departments and statutory boards under the authority of a statute (often called its \\"parent Act\\") or other lawful authority, and not directly by Parliament.Para. 10.020 in vol. 1 of . Subsidiary legislation currently in force in Singapore is published in looseleaf form in a series called the Subsidiary Legislation of the Republic of Singapore which is gathered in black binders. New subsidiary legislation published in the Gazette may be viewed for free online for five days on the Electronic Gazette website. =Judicial precedents= High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore As Singapore is a common law jurisdiction, judgements handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgements may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity which have been laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes. Since 1992, judgements of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore have appeared in the Singapore Law Reports (SLR), which is published by the Singapore Academy of Law under an exclusive licence from the Supreme Court of Singapore. The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore's full independence in 1965 in special volumes of the SLR, and is currently working on a reissue of this body of case law. Cases published in the SLR as well as unreported judgements of the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts are available on-line from a fee-based service called LawNet, which is also managed by the Academy. Outside Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, they are available online from another fee-based service called Justis. =Custom= A custom is an established practice or course of behaviour that persons who engaged in it consider law. Customs do not have the force of law unless recognised in a case. \\"Legal\\" or \\"trade\\" customs are not recognised as law unless they are certain and not unreasonable or illegal.Chan, p. 122. In Singapore, custom is a minor source of law as not many customs have judicial recognition. Criminal law smoking to carrying durians is banned on Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit system The criminal law of Singapore is largely statutory in nature. The general principles of criminal law, as well as the elements and penalties of common criminal offences such as homicide, theft and cheating, are set out in the Penal Code.. Other important offences are created by statutes such as the Arms Offences Act,. Kidnapping Act,. Misuse of Drugs Act. and Vandalism Act.. In addition, Singapore society is highly regulated through the criminalisation of many activities which are considered as fairly harmless in other countries. These include failing to flush toilets after use,Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations (Cap. 95, Rg. 3, 2000 Rev. Ed.), rg. 16. littering,, s. 17(1). jaywalking,Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossings) Rules (Cap. 276, R 24). the possession of pornography,Penal Code, s. 292(a) (possessing any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or figure, or any other obscene object). the sale of chewing gum,Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations (Cap. 283, Rg. 2, 2004 Rev. Ed.). and sexual activity such as oral and anal sex between men.Penal Code, s. 377A. Nonetheless, Singapore is one of the countries with the least crime in the world, with a low incidence of violent crimes. Singapore retains both corporal punishment (in the form of caning) and capital punishment (by hanging) as punishments for serious offences. For some offences, most notably trafficking in drugs above a certain specified quantity, the imposition of these penalties is mandatory.

The group consisted of Diamond Dallas Page, Chris Kanyon and Bam Bam Bigelow. Their name came from the members being billed from New Jersey (although Kanyon was actually from New York). History =Formation= Shortly after Slamboree in May 1999, Diamond Dallas Page formed an alliance with fellow New Jerseyan Bam Bam Bigelow and began feuding with Perry Saturn and Raven for the WCW World Tag Team Championship. On the May 31, 1999 episode of Nitro, Page and Bigelow sent Raven to the hospital after a severe beating, leaving Saturn alone to defend the Tag Team Titles, which Page and Bigelow won later that night with help from Chris Kanyon replacing Raven in the match and turned heel on former ally Raven, costing the team the championships by letting Page pin him. Page, Bigelow, and Kanyon became known as the Jersey Triad after Kanyon officially joined them on the June 7, 1999 episode of Nitro, when he turned on Saturn after Chris Benoit and Saturn defeated Page and Bigelow. Page and Kanyon lost the Tag Titles to Saturn and Benoit on the June 10 episode of Thunder but the Triad regained the belts three days later at The Great American Bash on June 13, 1999, after Kanyon pinned Benoit. =\\"Freebird Rule\\"= Due to an affiliation with then \\"WCW President for Life\\" Ric Flair, the Triad was permitted to defend these titles in any way possible using the Freebird Rule- any two of the three wrestlers could defend the tag team titles at any time. This even saw the Triad switching members during a title defense, the rule being one member had to be on the floor at all times. On July 11, 1999 at Bash at the Beach the Jersey Triad defeated Benoit and Saturn again to retain their Tag Team Titles. The team held the titles until Road Wild where Kanyon and Bigelow would lose them to Harlem Heat on August 14, 1999. In the same night Chris Benoit defeated Diamond Dallas Page to retain his WCW United States Championship, despite interference from Kanyon and Bigelow =Break up and aftermath= The group broke up shortly after Fall Brawl in September 1999, after Goldberg pinned Page. Diamond Dallas Page continued feuding with Hogan again, joining Sid Vicious and Rick Steiner in a team effort to take on Hogan, Sting, and Goldberg. Soon after that feud ended Page turned into a hero again and feuded with both Kanyon and Bigelow before the year ended. Both Page and Bigelow feuded with Kanyon during his Chris \\"Champagne\\" Kanyon gimmick. Page and Kanyon would eventually reunite as a tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) during the WCW Invasion storyline, as they were both members of the Alliance in 2001.

Written by Jean Lisette Aroeste and directed by Ralph Senensky, it was first broadcast on October 18, 1968. In the episode, the Enterprise travels with an alien ambassador whose appearance induces madness. This episode was the second appearance of Diana Muldaur in the Star Trek franchise. She appeared previously as Dr. Ann Mulhall in the second season episode, \\"Return to Tomorrow\\" and would later appear as Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise is assigned to escort Medusan ambassador Kollos and psychologist Miranda Jones to a rendezvous with a Medusan vessel. Medusans are non-humanoid creatures whose outward appearance is described as being so ugly as to cause humanoids who see them to go insane and then die. Kollos travels in a carrier to hide him from view, and First Officer Spock assists as necessary using a special visor which allows his Vulcan psychology to withstand the sight of Kollos. Jones is also able to observe Kollos with the help of the visor, a fact which she claims is due to Vulcan-style mental discipline. At a dinner with Captain Kirk and the senior officers, Jones, a telepath, explains that her assignment is to attempt a mind link with Kollos in the hope of allowing Starfleet to utilize the Medusan's unique senses and navigational abilities. In the course of the discussion, Jones breaks off, sensing someone nearby with murderous intentions. She then returns to her quarters, where she is visited by her associate Lawrence Marvick. Marvick is in love with Jones, a feeling which she does not reciprocate, and she senses that he is the would-be murderer. He then makes his way to Kollos's quarters with a phaser, but is overcome by the sight of the Medusan before he can fire. Now insane, Marvick rushes to Engineering, overpowers and renders unconscious Chief Engineer Scott and other crew members, and takes control of the engines. The Enterprise quickly accelerates past Warp Factor 9.5, which takes it far outside of the galaxy and into a strange swirling void. Marvick, now restrained, screams wild accusations at Jones before he dies. With no navigational references, the Enterprise crew cannot return home. Kirk suggests that Kollos's superior navigational abilities could be of use, and Spock volunteers to mind meld with Kollos, allowing the two to pilot the Enterprise as one entity. Miranda Jones objects that she is a more logical choice, but McCoy reveals that she is blind and therefore couldn't possibly pilot a starship. (Her jeweled wrap, it turns out, is actually an elaborate sensor web.) A partition is set up on the bridge to hide Kollos, and Spock, wearing the visor, completes the mind link. Kollos and Spock, acting through Spock's body, successfully return the Enterprise to known space, and then retire behind the partition to dissolve the link, but forgetting the visor. Kirk shouts a warning, but Spock, unable to look away in time, goes mad and attacks the crew. He is subdued by a phaser blast from Kirk and rushed to Sickbay, where his condition deteriorates. Jones attempts to make mental contact with Spock but is apparently unable to help, and Kirk suggests that she, in her jealousy, does not really wish to. Enraged by the accusation, she makes one more attempt, and succeeds in bringing Spock's mind back to reality. The Enterprise arrives at its destination, and Kollos and Jones prepare to depart. Jones thanks Kirk for his insight, crediting it with ensuring her future. Kollos and Jones are now \\"one\\", and she now knows the joy of the mind link for herself. Kirk gives Jones a rose as they leave, reminding her that every rose has thorns. Production and reception This was the final episode filmed in the series' production that featured Eddie Paskey as Lt. Leslie. As the episodes were however shown out of production order, the final episode to feature the character was \\"Elaan of Troyius\\". The title is taken from a line in the poem \\"Jordan\\" by George Herbert.https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44364/jordan-i The Vulcan philosophy \\"Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations\\" first appeared in the episode. Show creator Gene Roddenberry inserted a speech by Kirk praising the philosophy and associated medal. The \\"pointless\\" speech was, according to William Shatner, a \\"thinly-veiled commercial\\" for replicas of the medal, which Roddenberry's company Lincoln Enterprises soon sold to fans.

They were also known as adjutators. Many of the ideas of the movement were later adopted by the Levellers. History Agitators, or adjutators, was the name given to representatives elected in 1647 by the different regiments of the English Parliamentary army. The word really means an agent, but it was confused with \\"adjutant,\\" often called \\"agitant,\\" a title familiar to the soldiers, and thus the form \\"adjutator\\" came into use. Early in 1647 the Long Parliament wished either to disband many of the regiments or to send them to Ireland. The soldiers, whose pay was largely in arrears, refused to accept either alternative, and eight of the cavalry regiments elected agitators, called at first commissioners, who laid their grievances before the three generals, and whose letter was read in the House of Commons on the 30 April 1647. The other regiments followed the example of the cavalry (nicknamed Ironsides), and the agitators, who belonged to the lower ranks of the army, were supported by many of the officers, who showed their sympathy by signing 'Declaration of the army. Cromwell and other generals succeeded to some extent in pacifying the troops by promising the payment of arrears for eight weeks at once; but before the return of the generals to London parliament had again decided to disband the army, and soon afterwards fixed the 1 June as the date on which this process was to begin. Again alarmed, the agitators decided to resist; a mutiny occurred in one regiment and the attempt at disbandment failed. Then followed the seizure of King Charles I by Cornet Joyce. The Agitators, with two officers from each regiment and the Generals formed a new body called the Army Council which after a meeting near Newmarket, Suffolk on Friday 4 June 1647 issued \\"A Solemne Engagement of the Army, under the Command of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax\\" to Parliament on 8 June making their concerns known, and also the constitution of the Army Council so that Parliament would understand that the discontent was army-wide and had the support of both officers and other ranks. This Engagement was read out to the army at a general meeting on 5 June. A few weeks later, there was another meeting while the army was camped at Thriplow Heath near Royston, the soldiers refused the offers made by Parliament, and the agitators demanded a march towards London and the \\"purging\\" of the House of Commons, which did not happen. Subsequent events are part of the general history of England. Gradually the agitators ceased to exist, but many of their ideas were adopted by the Levellers, who may perhaps be regarded as their successors. Gardiner says of them, \\"Little as it was intended at the time, nothing was more calculated than the existence of this elected body of agitators to give to the army that distinctive political and religious character which it ultimately bore\\".

It was open from March 8, 1968, to June 27, 1971, and featured some of the biggest acts in rock music at the time. The Fillmore East was a companion to Graham's Fillmore Auditorium, and its successor, the Fillmore West, in San Francisco, Graham's home base. Pre-Fillmore East The theatre at 105 Second Avenue that became the Fillmore East was originally built as a Yiddish theater in 1925‚Äì26 ‚Äì designed by Harrison Wiseman in the Medieval Revival style ‚Äì at a time when that section of Second Avenue was known as the \\"Yiddish Theater District\\" and the \\"Jewish Rialto\\" because of the numerous theatres that catered to a Yiddish-speaking audience. Called the Commodore Theater, and independently operated, it eventually was taken over by Loews Inc. and became a movie theater, the Loews Commodore. It later became the Village Theatre, owned by Roger Euster, with on-site management by Ben Barenholtz. When Bill Graham took over the theatre in 1968, it was unused and had fallen into disrepair. Despite the deceptively small front marquee and fa√ßade, the theater had a substantial capacity of almost 2,700. Fillmore East years The venue provided Graham with an East Coast counterpart to his existing Fillmore in San Francisco, California.Shelton, Robert. \\"7,500 Attend Concerts at the Fillmore East.\\" The New York Times, April 1, 1968, p. 56. Opening on March 8, 1968, the Fillmore East quickly became known as \\"The Church of Rock and Roll,\\" with two- show, triple-bill concerts several nights a week. Graham would regularly alternate acts between the East and West Coast venues. Until early 1971, bands were booked to play two shows per night, at 8 pm and 11 pm, on both Friday and Saturday nights. =Notable acts= Among the notable acts to play the Fillmore East was Jimi Hendrix. His album Band of Gypsys was recorded live on New Year's Day 1970. British blues-rock trio Cream played the Fillmore East when it was called the \\"Village Theater\\" on September 20 & 23, 1967.Cream by Chris Welch The Kinks played October 17 & 18, 1969, supported by the Bonzo Dog Band. Ike & Tina Turner played on January 9 & 10, 1970, supported by Fats Domino. John Lennon and Yoko Ono sat in with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention at the theater on June 6, 1971. The Allman Brothers Band played so many shows at Fillmore East that they were sometimes called \\"Bill Graham's house band\\"; additionally, the Grateful Dead played a total of 43 concerts at the theater from June 1968 through April 1971. Jefferson Airplane performed six shows and Taj Mahal played eight shows at the venue, while Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young did four shows in September 1969 and six performances in June 1970.http://www.sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1970 Led Zeppelin made four appearances in early 1969, opening for Iron Butterfly. Amateur film footage of their January 31 performance can be viewed at the Led Zeppelin website.\\"Fillmore East ‚Äì Jan 31, 1969\\" on LedZeppelin.com The Joshua Light Show, headed by Joshua White, was an integral part of many performances, with its psychedelic art lighting on a backdrop behind many live bands.Del Signore, John, Joshua White, \\"The Joshua Light Show\\" , Gothamist, April 2, 2007. From the summer of 1970, the Pig Light Show under the direction of Marc L. Rubinstein performed at the theater from time to time trading duties until the venue's closing in 1971 with Joe's Lights, made up of former members of the Joshua Light Show which remained the de facto house light show. National Educational Television taped a show on September 23, 1970, for broadcast. It featured The Byrds, Elvin Bishop Group, Albert King, Sha Na Na, Van Morrison and Joe's Lights. The Allman Brothers were also taped for broadcast but due to technical difficulties, the segment with them was not aired. The show, \\"Welcome To Fillmore East\\" was aired on WNET channel 13 in NYC and simulcast on WNEW-FM radio on October 10, 1970, at 10:00 pm in the NYC area.

Because of its excellent acoustics, the enthusiastic and attentive audiences and Graham's innovative way of handling of the concert environment, the hall became a favorite spot for the recording of many live albums. Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts, on why they recorded their first live album there: 'We realized that we got a better sound live and that were a live band. (...) And we realized that the audience was a big part of what we did. (...) There was no question about where to record a concert. New York crowds have always been great, but what made the Fillmore special was Bill Graham. He was the best promoter rock has ever had and you could feel his influence in every little single thing at the Fillmore. It was just special. The bands felt it and the crowd felt it and it lit all of us up. The Fillmore was the high octane gig to play in New York - or anywhere else, really. (...) It was a great sounding room with a great crowd. (...) The Fillmores were so professionally run, compared to anything else at the time. And he would gamble on acts, bringing in jazz and blues (...) and he had taken a chance on the Brothers. 'Paul, Alan.

Because of changes in the music industry and large growth in the concert industry (as exemplified by the increased prevalence of arena and stadium bookings), Graham closed the Fillmore East after only three years. The final concert took place on June 27, 1971, with three billed acts (The Allman Brothers Band, The J. Geils Band, Albert King) and special surprise guests (Edgar Winter's White Trash, Mountain, The Beach Boys, Country Joe McDonald) in an invitation-only performance.Perkins, Willie.

The AMS also operates student services, businesses, resource groups and clubs. The AMS is a non-profit organization that exists to advocate student viewpoints and ensure the needs of students are met by the University Administration and the Provincial and Federal governments. The Alma Mater Society is composed of a number of constituency organizations for undergraduate students in particular faculties and the Graduate Student Society of UBC. Governance The highest decision- making body of the AMS is the Student Council. Meeting every two weeks during the Academic Year, and every three weeks during the summer, this body has representatives from each of the Schools and Faculties of UBC, the affiliate colleges: Regent College, Vancouver School of Theology, and St. Mark's College, Vancouver as well as the five members of the Executive, two representatives of the Student Senate Caucus, the two Vancouver student members of the UBC Board of Governors, and several non-voting positions including the Executive Coordinator of Student Services, and the Ombudsperson. Members of Council are the Directors of the Society (as defined under the Society Act of British Columbia) and are responsible for all high-level financial and legal decisions made by the AMS - including the overseeing of internal procedures (known as the Code of Procedure), a $22 million budget, the Student Union Building (known as the AMS Nest Building), and policy statements. The operations of the AMS are governed by a five-member Executive, as well as a professional Managing Director, and the Student Services Manager. The Executive consists of the President, the Vice-President Academic and University Affairs, the Vice-President Finance, the Vice-President Administration, and the Vice-President External Affairs. Members of the Executive are elected in a campus-wide election each January, along with five Senators-at-Large to the UBC Senate, and two student representatives to the UBC Board of Governors. =Elections= Until February 2004, candidates running for Executive positions ran as part of a slate. The 2005 AMS election was the first election which the AMS saw electoral candidates run as independents. Past slates included Students for Students (more right-leaning candidates with strong support from athletes, fraternities and residences), Action Now/Students' Voice/SPAN-Student Progressive Action Network (more left- leaning candidates with strong support from students living off-campus, the safety community and resource groups) and the Radical Beer Faction (the longest-running slate in AMS history). The AMS elections have been characterized by low turnout. A number of initiatives have been undertaken to improve the level of engagement with the student society, and increase turnout levels.

It divides the clubs into 9 categories: Academic/Management, Community Service, Cultural/Identity/Social, Leisure/Hobby/Special Interest, Media/Arts/Performance, Rec/Athletic, Political/Social Action, Science, and Spiritual. The SAC sets out procedures for constituting clubs and manages the space use within the Student Union Building as well as the general operation of AMS Clubs. They have the power to constitute or de-constitute a club, as well as direct a club to take actions in order to ensure rules and regulations are followed accordingly. The SAC is chaired by the Vice President Administration of the AMS. It also has several AMS Directors and member at large sitting in the committee. The Vice Chair of SAC is an appointed student employee of the AMS. Initiatives and services One of the major projects that the AMS has undertaken is the New SUB Project in order to increase available space for student activities by 50% compared to the old Student Union Building. The initiative was approved by referendum in April 2008 and construction is slated to begin in 2012. The building is funded by an incremental increase in student fees, which will supply $80 million for the construction of the building. The building, more commonly referred to as the AMS Nest building, has of space, costing about $108.3 million (with $25 million from the university). The building opened during the summer of 2015. The AMS runs many services for students on the UBC campus, including The Sexual Assault Support Centre (SASC), Speakeasy, a peer support group for students, the AMS Advocacy Office, the AMS Food Bank, AMS Tutoring, a health and dental plan for students, and Safewalk, a service for escorting students on campus safely. In addition, the AMS lobbies local and provincial governments and institutions for the benefit of the student body. For example, the AMS lobbied against the $16 million funding cuts to B.C. post-secondary institutions in 2009. On September 25, 2012, the AMS founded Get OnBoard BC, a coalition of transit stakeholders in the Metro Vancouver region to lobby for increases to public transit funding. The organization continues to exist today as a separate registered not for profit under the BC Societies Act. Representation By paying student fees, a student becomes a member of the AMS.

Unlike the undergraduate programs with direct elections, Graduate Student seats on AMS council are appointed by the council of the Graduate Student Society, which is recognized by the University as the representative body of graduate students. The AMS was a founding member of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations. Due to scandal, the AMS withdrew from CASA in the late 1990s, but later rejoined. In 2008, AMS Council voted to step down to Associate Membership, citing concerns over centralized control, costs and value. In October 2009, AMS Council voted to withdraw entirely from the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, however, this decision was overturned on March 31, 2010, until the AMS ultimately withdrew entirely in November 2011. While the AMS is not a member of any federal student federation, it is currently affiliated with the Undergraduates of Canadian Research Intensive Universities. On December 1, 2013, the AMS formally founded the Alliance of British Columbia Students, a not for profit confederation of British Columbia student societies advocating for a better post-secondary landscape in BC. The organization at the time represented nine student associations. The AMS voted to leave the ABCS in 2015. Though the AMS is not affiliated with any provincial student federation, it has worked with the Simon Fraser Student Society and the BC Federation of Students to lobby the provincial government.

It is the home of the Lego Group head office. A company town, it is also the site of a theme park, Legoland, waterpark resort, Lalandia, and Billund Airport which is the second largest airport in Denmark. The airport opened in 1964 and was built by the Lego Group, but is now run independently. With a population of 6,662 (1 January 2020),BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark Billund is the second largest town in Billund Municipality, Region of Southern Denmark, following the municipal seat of Grindsted. On the outskirts of the town there is a Lego factory, which, , manufactured 90% of the company's products. Adjacent to the company's headquarters is the first Legoland theme park, which opened in 1968 and is called Legoland Billund. In addition to the Lego Group, Sun-Air of Scandinavia has its head office in Billund.\\"Locations .\\" Lego Group. Retrieved on 16 March 2010.\\"Contact .\\" Sun Air of Scandinavia. Retrieved on 16 March 2010. History Billund has long been part of the parish of Grene Kirke (\\"Grove Church\\") whose original Romanesque building was first mentioned in 1291. The town's name was first mentioned as \\"Byllundt\\" in 1454 and as \\"Billund\\" in 1510. In 1880, the town's first windmill was built on the road between Vejle and Varde. In 1895, the mill burned to the ground but was rebuilt in 1897, this time in the style of Dutch windmills. That same year, a railway was built from Vejle to Billund, and the route was later extended to Grindsted in 1914. In 1916, Ole Kirk Christiansen, who later founded The Lego Group, bought a Billund furniture company that was founded in 1895. He invested in the town, creating a new dairy and the Skjoldbjerg church a few miles south of town. In 1930, Kirk Christiansen began producing utility items such as ironing boards, stepladders and miniature toys. His first toys were created from scraps from the production of his other goods but his true toy production started in 1932. In 1934, the toy factory was named \\"Lego.\\" In the late 1930s Billund experienced growth due to the factories and began to build waterworks, a gymnasium, and the town hall, though the local power station was closed and relocated. In 1942, during the Nazi occupation in World War II, the old Lego factory was destroyed by fire, but a new one was immediately erected. In 1946, the railway track from Grindsted was extended to the Lego factory. Plastic Lego Bricks were first released from the factory in 1949. The 1950s brought a recession to Billund with the closing of the railroad. In response to the growing poverty, the Billund Housing Association was founded and created affordable housing as well as a retirement home. Lego created a large park north of town with a playground, outdoor scene, toboggan hill and a man-made lake in 1959. In 1964 the Billund Airport was inaugurated, first as the Lego Group's private airport, and was later opened for other uses. Legoland opened in 1968, and Billund again began to experience growth.  Geography  Billund is located approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) from Grindsted, 56 kilometers (35 miles) from Esbjerg, and 27 kilometers (17 miles) from The Regional Capital of Vejle.  Demographics  As of 2012 the town had 6,146 residents. In the beginning of the 1930s Billund was still a small village with only 300 residents. In the 1950s the village reached 500 residents and after this time that number increased rapidly. After only 20 years, in 1970 this number quadrupled to 2,065 residents. Population growth exploded because of Lego's rapid expansion in the mid-1960s. The town's demographics are characterized by many families with children; approximately 27.3% of the households in the town consist of couples with children. This is somewhat above the average for the region. The residents in the town mostly live in family houses.

In just over 26 months, from April 14, 1917, to June 30, 1919, it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and to enlist public support against the foreign and perceived domestic attempts to stop America's participation in the war. It used mainly propaganda to accomplish its goals. Organizational history \\"U.S. Official War Pictures\\", CPI poster by Louis D. Fancher =Establishment= President Woodrow Wilson (the 28th president) established the Committee on Public Information (CPI) through Executive Order 2594 on April 13, 1917. The committee consisted of George Creel (chairman) and as ex officio members the Secretaries of: State (Robert Lansing), War (Newton D. Baker), and the Navy (Josephus Daniels). The CPI was the first state bureau covering propaganda in the history of the United States. Creel urged Wilson to create a government agency to coordinate \\"not propaganda as the Germans defined it, but propaganda in the true sense of the word, meaning the 'propagation of faith.'\\" He was a journalist with years of experience on the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News before accepting Wilson's appointment to the CPI. He had a contentious relationship with Secretary Lansing.Creel, 158-60 =Activities= Wilson established the first modern propaganda office, the Committee on Public Information (CPI), headed by George Creel.George Creel, How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information That Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe. (1920)Stephen Vaughn, Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information (1980). online Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort. It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda. Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men. CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.Katherine H. Adams, Progressive Politics and the Training of America‚Äôs Persuaders (1999) Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four- minute breaks needed to change reels. They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages. Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people. The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.Lisa Mastrangelo, \\"World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation.\\" Rhetoric & Public Affairs 12#4 (2009): 607-633. Historians were assigned to write pamphlets and in-depth histories of the causes of the European war.George T. Blakey, Historians on the Homefront: American Propagandists for the Great War (1970)Committee on public information, Complete Report of the Committee on Public Information: 1917, 1918, 1919 (1920) online free left The CPI used material that was based on fact, but spun it to present an upbeat picture of the American war effort. In his memoirs, Creel claimed that the CPI routinely denied false or undocumented atrocity reports, fighting the crude propaganda efforts of \\"patriotic organizations\\" like the National Security League and the American Defense Society that preferred \\"general thundering\\" and wanted the CPI to \\"preach a gospel of hate.\\"Creel, 195-6 The committee used newsprint, posters, radio, telegraph, and movies to broadcast its message. It recruited about 75,000 \\"Four Minute Men,\\" volunteers who spoke about the war at social events for an ideal length of four minutes. They covered the draft, rationing, war bond drives, victory gardens and why America was fighting. They were advised to keep their message positive, always use their own words and avoid \\"hymns of hate.\\"Thomas Fleming, The Illusion of Victory: America in World War I. New York: Basic Books, 2003; pg. 117. For ten days in May 1917, the Four Minute Men were expected to promote \\"Universal Service by Selective Draft\\" in advance of national draft registration on June 5, 1917.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pp. 92-94. The CPI staged events designed for many different ethnic groups, in their language. For instance, Irish-American tenor John McCormack sang at Mount Vernon before an audience representing Irish-American organizations.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pp. 117-118. The Committee also targeted the American worker and, endorsed by Samuel Gompers, filled factories and offices with posters designed to promote the critical role of American labor in the success of the war effort.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pg. 118. The CPI's activities were so thorough that historians later stated, using the example of a typical midwestern American farm family, that Creel wrote about the Committee's rejection of the word propaganda, saying: \\"We did not call it propaganda, for that word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption. Our effort was educational and informative throughout, for we had such confidence in our case as to feel that no other argument was needed than the simple, straightforward presentation of facts.\\" A report published in 1940 by the Council on Foreign Relations credits the Committee with creating \\"the most efficient engine of war propaganda which the world had ever seen\\", producing a \\"revolutionary change\\" in public attitude toward US participation in WWI:pp. 75-76, Harold J. Tobin and Percy W. Bidwell, Mobilizing Civilian America, New York: Council on Foreign Relations. =Organizational structure= During its lifetime, the organization had over twenty bureaus and divisions, with commissioner's offices in nine foreign countries. Both a News Division and a Films Division were established to help get out the war message. The CPI's daily newspaper, called the Official Bulletin, began at eight pages and grew to 32. It was distributed to every newspaper, post office, government office, and military base.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pp. 118-119. Stories were designed to report positive news. For example, the CPI promoted an image of well-equipped US troops preparing to face the Germans that were belied by the conditions visiting Congressmen reported.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pg. 173. The CPI released three feature-length films: Pershing's Crusaders (May 1918), America's Answer (to the Hun) (August 1918), Under Four Flags (November 1918). They were unsophisticated attempts to impress the viewer with snippets of footage from the front, far less sensational than the \\"crudely fantastical\\" output of Hollywood in the same period.Thomas Doherty, Projections of War: Hollywood, American Culture, and World War II (NY: Columbia University Press, 1999), 89-91. Hollywood's films \\"served to discredit not only the portrayal of war on screen but the whole enterprise of cinematic propaganda.\\" Hollywood titles included Escaping the Hun, To Hell with the Kaiser!, and The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin. To reach those Americans who might not read newspapers, attend meetings or watch movies, Creel created the Division of Pictorial Publicity. The Division produced 1438 designs for propaganda posters, cards buttons and cartoons in addition to 20000 lantern pictures (slides) to be used with the speeches.Creel, George. How we advertised America. New York & London: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1920. p. 7. Charles Dana Gibson was America's most popular illustrator and an ardent supporter of the war. When Creel asked him to assemble a group of artists to help design posters for the government, Gibson was more than eager to help. Famous illustrators such as James Montgomery Flagg, Joseph Pennell, Louis D. Fancher, and N. C. Wyeth were brought together to produce some of World War I's most lasting images. =Media incidents= One early incident demonstrated the dangers of embroidering the truth. The CPI fed newspapers the story that ships escorting the First Division to Europe sank several German submarines, a story discredited when newsmen interviewed the ships' officers in England. Republican Senator Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania called for an investigation and The New York Times called the CPI \\"the Committee on Public Misinformation.\\"Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pp. 119-120. The incident turned the once compliant news publishing industry into skeptics.Mary S. Mander, Pen and Sword: American War Correspondents, 1898-1975 (University of Illinois, 2010), 46. Creel believed his story was correct, but that opponents in the military who were jealous of his control of military information minimized what happened en route. There is some confusion as to whether or not the claims are correct based upon subsequent information published by the CPI. Early in 1918, the CPI made a premature announcement that \\"the first American built battle planes are today en route to the front in France,\\" but newspapers learned that the accompanying pictures were fake, there was only one plane, and it was still being tested.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pg. 173. Creel blamed the Secretary of War for the false story. At other times, though the CPI could control in large measure what newspapers printed, its exaggerations were challenged and mocked in Congressional hearings.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pg. 240. The Committee's overall tone also changed with time, shifting from its original belief in the power of facts to mobilization based on hate, like the slogan \\"Stop the Hun!\\" on posters showing a US soldier taking hold of a German soldier in the act of terrorizing a mother and child, all in support of war bond sales.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pg. 247. =International efforts= The CPI extended its efforts overseas as well and found it had to tailor its work to its audience. In Latin America, its efforts were led where possible by American journalists with experience in the region, because, said one organizer, \\"it is essentially a newspaperman's job\\" with the principal aim of keeping the public \\"informed about war aims and activities.\\" The Committee found the public bored with the battle pictures and stories of heroism supplied for years by the competing European powers. In Peru it found there was an audience for photos of shipyards and steel mills. In Chile it fielded requests for information about America's approach to public health, forest protection, and urban policing. In some countries it provided reading rooms and language education. Twenty Mexican journalists were taken on a tour of the United States.James R. Mock, \\"The Creel Committee in Latin America,\\" in Hispanic American Historical Review vol. 22 (1942), 262-79, esp. 266-7, 269-70, 272-4 =Political conflict= Creel used his overseas operations as a way to gain favor with congressmen who controlled the CPI's funding, sending friends of congressmen on brief assignments to Europe.Stone, Melville Elijah. Fifty Years a Journalist. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Page and Company, 1921. p. 342-5. Some of his business arrangements drew congressional criticism as well, particularly his sale by competitive bidding of the sole right to distribute battlefield pictures.Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, on the Proposed Revenue Act of 1918, Part II: Miscellaneous Taxes (Washington, DC: 1918), 967ff., available online, accessed January 19, 2011. Despite hearings to air grievances against the CPI, the investigating committee passed its appropriation unanimously.Stephens, Oren. Facts to a Candid World: America's Overseas Information Program. Stanford University Press, 1955. p. 33. Creel also used the CPI's ties to the newspaper publishing industry to trace the source of negative stories about Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, a former newsman and a political ally. He tracked them to Louis Howe, assistant to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and threatened to expose him to the President.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory. p. 148-149. As a Wilson partisan, Creel showed little respect for his congressional critics, and Wilson enjoyed how Creel expressed sentiments the President could not express himself.Fleming, The Illusion of Victory. p. 315.For Wilson's support of Creel to a group of senators, see Thomas C. Sorenson, \\"We Become Propagandists,\\" in Garth S. Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell (eds.), Readings in Propaganda and Persuasion: New and Classic Essays (Sage Publications, 2006), p. 88. Asked if he thought all Congressmen were loyal, Creel answered: \\"I do not like slumming, so I won't explore into the hearts of Congress for you.\\" Wilson later said: \\"Gentlemen, when I think of the manner in which Mr. Creel has been maligned and persecuted, I think it is a very human thing for him to have said.\\" =Termination and disestablishment= Committee work was curtailed after July 1, 1918. Domestic activities stopped after the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. Foreign operations ended June 30, 1919. Wilson abolished the CPI by executive order 3154 on August 21, 1919. The Committee on Public Information was formally disestablished by an act of Congress on June 30, 1919, although the organization's work had been formally completed months before.Creel, How We Advertised America, pg. ix. On August 21, 1919, the disbanded organization's records were turned over to the Council of National Defense. Memoirs Creel later published his memoirs of his service with the CPI, How We Advertised America, in which he wrote:George Creel, How We Advertised America. New York: Harper & Brothers, 1920; pp. 4‚Äì5. :In no degree was the Committee an agency of censorship, a machinery of concealment or repression. Its emphasis throughout was on the open and the positive. At no point did it seek or exercise authorities under those war laws that limited the freedom of speech and press. In all things, from first to last, without halt or change, it was a plain publicity proposition, a vast enterprise in salesmanship, the world's greatest adventures in advertising.... We did not call it propaganda, for that word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption. Our effort was educational and informative throughout, for we had such confidence in our case as to feel that no other argument was needed than the simple, straightforward presentation of the facts. '' Criticism Walter Lippmann, a Wilson adviser, journalist, and co-founder of The New Republic, was a sharp critic of Creel. He had once written an editorial criticizing Creel for violating civil liberties, as Police Commissioner of Denver. Without naming Creel, he wrote in a memo to Wilson that censorship should \\"never be entrusted to anyone who is not himself tolerant, nor to anyone who is unacquainted with the long record of folly which is the history of suppression.\\" After the war, Lippmann criticized the CPI's work in Europe: \\"The general tone of it was one of unmitigated brag accompanied by unmitigated gullibility, giving shell-shocked Europe to understand that a rich bumpkin had come to town with his pockets bulging and no desire except to please.\\"Ronald Steel, Walter Lippmann and the American Century. Boston: Little, Brown, 1980, pp. 125-126, 141-147; Fleming, The Illusion of Victory, pg. 335; John Luskin, Lippmann, Liberty, and the Press. University of Alabama Press, 1972, pg. 36 The Office of Censorship in World War II did not follow the CPI precedent. It used a system of voluntary co- operation with a code of conduct, and it did not disseminate government propaganda. Staff Among those who participated in the CPI's work were: * Edward Bernays, a pioneer in public relations and later theorist of the importance of propaganda to democratic governance.W. Lance Bennett, \\"Engineering Consent: The Persistence of a Problematic Communication Regime,\\" in Peter F. Nardulli, ed., Domestic Perspectives on Contemporary Democracy (University of Illinois Press, 2008), 139 He directed the CPI's Latin News Service. The CPI's poor reputation prevented Bernays from handling American publicity at the 1919 Peace Conference as he wanted.Martin J. Manning with Herbert Romerstein, Historical Dictionary of American Propaganda (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 24 * Carl R. Byoir (18861957), like Bernays, a founding father of public relations in America. * Maurice Lyons was the Secretary of the Committee.

Opened at appropriate location, with civil parish boundaries and names shown. The site of the waterfall is owned by the National Trust. Description The stream flowing over the waterfall is Aira Beck, which rises on the upper slopes of Stybarrow Dodd at a height of and flows north-easterly before turning south, blocked by the high heather- covered slopes of Gowbarrow Fell. It turns south on its eight-kilometre journey to join Ullswater, at a height of . One kilometre before entering the lake, the beck makes the leap down a rocky and steep sided ravine at the falls known as Aira Force. The water falls approximately to a rocky pool, from where the beck continues through a shallow valley to the lake. The river name Aira is derived from Old Norse eyrr, a gravel bank, and Old Norse √°, a river, hence \\"the river at the gravel bank\\", a reference to Aira Point, a gravelly spit where the river enters Ullswater. The Old Norse word fors, waterfall, has been adopted into several northern English dialects and is widely used for waterfalls, with the English spelling 'Force'. Thus, \\"the waterfall on gravel- bank river\\".Gambles, Robert: Lake District Place Names: Hayloft Publishing (2013): Tourism Wish tree coins in timber at Aira Force Aira Force lies on land owned by the National Trust. The Trust purchased the 750-acre Gowbarrow Park (on which the force lies) in 1906 and has provided facilities, such as car parking, disabled access, graded paths, and viewing platforms to make Aira Force one of the most famous and most visited waterfalls in the Lake District. Visit Cumbria. Details National Trust purchase. The National Trust has also provided public lavatories and a caf√©, and the site is open to visitors throughout the year. A public footpath from the village of Dockray passes the waterfall. Beside the walk that passes up the glen is located a good example of a Wish Tree, in this case using a large fallen tree trunk. Visitors hammer coins into it using stones from the site. In 2015, Ullswater 'Steamers' opened a jetty on the lake shore near Aira Force, making the waterfall accessible by foot passenger ferry from Glenridding. A new footpath runs from Aira Force as far as Glencoyne Bay, but only a track exists from this point on.History of Ullswater 'Steamers' on the company website (accessed 25 July 2015). Bridges A small arched bridge spans the stream just as the beck goes over the falls giving views from the top. There is also a second bridge at the foot of the falls. Both bridges were constructed in honour of two members of the Spring family early in the 20th century. Cecil Spring Rice was the British ambassador to the USA during the First World War, while Stephen Spring Rice was a senior civil servant. The bridges are of particular interest: the lower is made of vertical stones, not traditional in this area of Cumbria, while the higher has horizontal stones, more in keeping with the dale customs. Segnetworks. Gives details of bridges. Poetry The Lake Poet William Wordsworth paid many visits to the area around Aira Force; he was probably inspired to write his poem \\"Daffodils\\", with the opening line \\"I wandered lonely as a cloud\\", as he observed daffodils growing on the shore of Ullswater near where Aira Beck enters the lake near Glencoyne Bay.www.visitcumbria.com. Details that Wordsworth was probably inspired to write daffodils at Glencoyne Bay. The falls themselves are mentioned in three Wordsworth poems, the most famous reference being in \\"The Somnambulist\\", where in the final verse he writes: Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem on the subject refers to a legend that a hermit once lived beneath the falls.

History  = Construction = Tayleur was designed by William Rennie of Liverpool and built at the Charles Tayleur foundry at Warrington for owners Charles Moore & Company of Mooresfort lattin, Co Tipperary. She was launched in Warrington on the River Mersey on 4 October 1853 - it had taken just six months to build her. She was 230 feet in length with a 40-foot beam and displaced 1,750 tons, while 4,000 tons of cargo could be carried in holds 28 feet deep below three decks. She was named after Charles Tayleur, founder of the Vulcan Engineering Works, Bank Quay, Warrington. The new ship was chartered by White Star to serve the booming Australian trade routes, as transport to and from the colony was in high demand due to the discovery of gold there. = Disaster = Tayleur left Liverpool on 19 January 1854, on her maiden voyage, for Melbourne, Australia, with a complement of 652 passengers and crew. She was mastered by 29-year-old Captain John Noble. During the inquiry, it was determined that her crew of 71 had only 37 trained seamen amongst them, and of these, ten could not speak English. It was reported in newspaper accounts that many of the crew were seeking free passage to Australia. Most of the crew were able to survive. Her compasses did not work properly because of the iron hull. The crew believed that they were sailing south through the Irish Sea, but were actually travelling west towards Ireland. On 21 January 1854, within 48 hours of sailing, Tayleur found herself in a fog and a storm, heading straight for the island of Lambay. The rudder was undersized for her tonnage, so that she was unable to tack around the island. The rigging was also faulty; the ropes had not been properly stretched, so that they became slack, making it nearly impossible to control the sails. Despite dropping both anchors as soon as rocks were sighted, she ran aground on the east coast of Lambay Island, about five miles from Dublin Bay. Initially, attempts were made to lower the ship's lifeboats, but when the first one was smashed on the rocks, launching further boats was deemed unsafe. Tayleur was so close to land that the crew was able to collapse a mast onto the shore, and some people aboard were able to jump onto land by clambering along the collapsed mast. Some that reached shore had carried ropes from the ship, allowing others to pull themselves to safety on the ropes. Captain Noble waited on board Tayleur until the last minute, then jumped towards shore, being rescued by one of the passengers. With the storm and high seas continuing, the ship was then washed into deeper water. She sank to the bottom with only the tops of her masts showing. A surviving passenger alerted the coastguard station on the island. This passenger and four coast guards launched the coastguard galley. When they reached the wreck they found the last survivor, William Vivers, who had climbed to the tops of the rigging, and had spent 14 hours there. He was rescued by the coastguards. On 2 March 1854, George Finlay, the chief boatman, was awarded a silver medal for this rescue. Newspaper accounts blamed the crew for negligence, but the official Coroner's Inquest absolved Captain Noble and placed the blame on the ship's owners, accusing them of neglect for allowing the ship to depart without its compasses being properly adjusted. The Board of Trade, however, did fault the captain for not taking soundings, a standard practice when sailing in low visibility. The causes of the wreck were complex and included: * Compass problems due to the placing of an iron river steamer on the deck after the compasses had been swung. * Absence of a mast head compass placed at a distance from the iron hull. * Northerly current in the Irish sea similar to that which drove the Great Britain northward. * Slotting effect of the wind in the sails driving the ship sideways. * Small untried crew to manage the sails. * Large turning circle making ship unmaneuverable. * The anchor chains broke when they were dropped in final efforts to save the ship. * The captain had been injured in a serious fall and may have had head injuries. * Lack of lifebelts - then uncommon and panic led to increased loss of life, those who kept their heads or could swim, escaped. Tayleur has been compared with RMS Titanic. They shared similarities in their separate times. Both were RMS ships and White Star Liners (although these were different companies), and both went down on their maiden voyages. Inadequate or faulty equipment contributed to both disasters (faulty compasses and rigging for the Tayleur, and lack of binoculars and life boats for the Titanic). Enquiries There were four official enquiries: The inquest, held at Malahide; The Board of Trade Inquiry under Captain Walker; The Admiralty investigation was held by Mr Grantham, Inspector of Iron Ships; The Liverpool Maritime Board tried the fitness of Captain Noble to command. There are contradictions between these enquiries. Numbers of lives lost vary, as do the numbers given as to how many were on board. The latter are between 528 and 680, while the dead are supposed to be at least 297, and up to 380, depending on source. Out of over 100 women on board, only three survived, possibly because of the difficulty with the clothing of that era. The survivors were then faced with having to get up an almost sheer 80 foot (24m) cliff to get to shelter. When word of the disaster reached the Irish mainland, the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company sent the steamer Prince to look for survivors. Recent research by Dr Edward J Bourke names 662 on board. A memorial to those killed in the wreck was unveiled at Portrane (53.493441 -6.108558) on 16 May 1999.  Diving  Display in the National Maritime Museum of IrelandThe remains of the wreck were rediscovered in 1959 by members of the Irish Sub-Aqua Club. Because the wreck is over 100 years old (166 as of 29 December 2019) a licence to dive the site must be obtained from the Office of Public Works. The wreck lies at 17 metres depth some 30m off the southeast corner of Lambay Island in a small indentation at . Substantial wreckage includes the hull, side plates, a donkey engine and the lower mast. The woodwork was salvaged shortly after the wreck. Crockery from the cargo and several pieces of the wreck are on display at Newbridge House, Donabate.

It lies 34 degrees south of the equator, and is 55 kilometres east from the city of George on the N2 highway, and 33 kilometres west of the town of Plettenberg Bay on the same road. History Little is known about the indigenous inhabitants of Knysna, the Khoikhoi. The area east of present-day George was separated by high mountains and deep gorges, making it virtually inaccessible to European travellers. =European settlement= The SS Agnar tows an unknown sailing ship into Knysna Harbour in 1910. Nevertheless, the first Europeans arrived in the area in 1760, and the farm Melkhoutkraal (literally translating from Afrikaans as 'milk wood kraal‚Äô) was established on the eastern shore of the Knysna Lagoon. Stephanus Terblans, the first European farmer to settle in the area, was given a loan permit to farm here in 1770. Upon moving to Knysna George Rex, a British-born entrepreneur credited as being the founder of Knysna, acquired the loan rights to Melkhoutkraal in 1804 and later, in 1816, to the farm Welbedacht, which he renamed Eastford.Knysna Historical Society He gave of Eastford to the Colonial Government, on which the Royal Navy established the township of Melville. Rex‚Äôs properties were sold when he died in 1839. In April 1817, the transport brig , belonging to the Cape Town Dockyard, was the first European vessel to enter the Knysna heads. She struck a rock, now known as Emu Rock, and was holed. Her crew ran Emu ashore to prevent her sinking. In late April arrived to render assistance.Horsburgh (1826), Vol. 1, p.196. After surveying the area, Podargus sailed safely into the Knysna and retrieved Emus cargo.Asiatic Journal and Monthly Miscellany, (1818), Vol. 6, p.317. The next major settler in Knysna was Captain Thomas Henry Duthie, who married Caroline, George Rex‚Äôs daughter, and bought a portion of the Uitzigt farm from his father-in-law which Rex had named Belvidere.Travel Journal of Thomas Henry Duthie, 5 December 1830 The construction of a small Norman-style church was commissioned by Duthie on his property, and was consecrated in 1855. The settlement‚Äôs population grew slowly, and Englishmen such as Henry Barrington and Lt. Col. John Sutherland, who established the settlement of Newhaven on a portion of purchased land, settled in the area. At the time, Knysna was a field cornetcy of Plettenberg Bay within the Magisterial Division of George. In 1858, Knysna became a separate Magisterial Division, new stores and accommodation facilities were opened, and Knysna became the new commercial centre of the region. On their way to New Zealand, the Thesen family who were travelling from Norway fancied the little hamlet of Knysna so much that they decided to stay, bringing with them their knowledge of commerce and sailing. Soon, timber was being exported to the Cape from the vast areas of forest surrounding Knysna, and a steam sawmill and small shipyard were established. Later, these were relocated to Paarden Island, later known as Thesen's Island. =Millwood Gold Rush= Millwood House Museum In 1878, an important discovery was made in the area. A gold nugget was found in the Karatara River, near Ruigtevlei. Soon fortune hunters from all over the world arrived at the Millwood Forest in search of gold, and Millwood grew into a bustling town. Millwood was declared a gold field, the first in South Africa. However, soon not enough gold was being recovered to sustain a growing town, and the mining industry in the area collapsed. Some miners relocated to Knysna, bringing their little homes with them. One of the houses, known as 'Millwood House', now functions as a museum. =Amalgamation and timber industry= By 1880 over 1000 people had settled in Knysna. In 1882, the settlements of Newhaven, Melville and the \\"wedge\\" of land between the two villages were amalgamated to form the municipality of 'The Knysna', named after the Knysna River. Knysna's timber industry peaked when George Parkes arrived from Britain and saw the opportunity to use the hardwoods of the Knysna Forest for export to elsewhere in the country, and even overseas. He established the Knysna Forest Company, later renamed Geo. Parkes and Sons Ltd., which is still trading to this day. = 2017 Knysna fire = On June 7, 2017, fueled by strong winds from a severe storm - the Cape Storm of 2017- coming in from the west, a fire swept through the town and surrounding areas. Killing 9 as a direct result of the fires and another 2 indirectly and displacing around 10,000 people from all walks of life. One Forensic Investigator believes the fire was caused by arson. Geography The town is primarily built on the northern shore of a large warm-water estuary, known as the Knysna Lagoon, which is fed by the Knysna River. The estuary opens to the ocean after passing between two large headlands. These are popularly known as \\"The Heads\\", and have become infamous due to the loss of boats and fishermen passing through their treacherous and unpredictable waters. The Paquita, a German vessel, sank on the eastern side of the Knysna Heads in 1903. Near them are geological formations, known locally as \\"The Map Stones.\\" To the north of Knysna, Afro-Montane or temperate rainforest covers the hilly terrain for 20 km until changing to fynbos or macchia high in the Outeniqua Mountains. The eastern head is heavily developed, while the western head is a private nature reserve, formerly owned by teacher and television presenter William Smith. which he inherited from his father, famed ichthyologist J. L. B. Smith.https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/maths- boffin-sells-the-heads-412664 Panorama of Knysna as viewed from Pezula Estate =Climate= Knysna has an oceanic climate (Cfb in the K√∂ppen climate classification).

It is very fast with the 2016 winning average speed being .. 2017 will be the eighth running of the event which was founded in 2009. There was no event in 2013. Coats of arms =Municipal arms= The Knysna municipality assumed a coat of arms in 1959, and registered them with the Cape Provincial Administration on 24 June 1960.Cape of Good Hope Official Gazette 3034 (24 June 1960). The arms, which were designed by Ivan Mitford-Barberton, are: Quarterly, I Or a white horse's head couped at the neck proper; II Azure a fern frond in bend sinister Argent; III Azure a yellowwood tree Or; IV Or an elephant's head caboshed proper (in layman's terms: the shield is quartered, 1 a white horse's head on a gold background, 2 a silver fern frond on a blue background, 3 a yellowwood tree on a blue background and 4 an elephant's head on a gold background). The crest is a sailing ship, and the motto Concilio et prudentia. =Divisional council arms= The Knysna divisional council (the local authority for the rural areas outside the town) assumed a coat of arms in 1961 and registered them with the provincial administration on 28 July 1961.Cape of Good Hope Official Gazette 3092 (28 July 1961). The arms, designed by Schalk Pienaar, were: Per saltire, I Or on a mount Vert a stinkwood tree proper; II & III Argent three bars wavy Azure; IV Vert the brig Knysna proper the sails charged with two lions rampant Gules and pennants flotant Azure.

Sablefish was laid down on 5 June 1943 by Cramp Shipbuilding Company at their site in Philadelphia. The submarine was launched on 4 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Carol S. Burrough, wife of Captain Edmund W. Burrough, the former captain of . Sablefish was commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 18 December 1945, Commander Richard Henry Crane in command. Service history Following a shakedown cruise from New London, Conn., to Balboa, Canal Zone, the new submarine conducted type training in the Panama area until mid-May 1946. She then returned to her home port, New London, and spent the remainder of the year supporting ASW exercises off the east coast, participating in fleet exercises off Bermuda, and making a three-week cruise off Greenland. Her duty in 1946 established a pattern for her operations during much of her subsequent career. Highlights of her service for the next few years were: testing a new type of submarine escape buoy in January 1948, and again in September of that year; participating in ceremonies at Havana, Cuba, on 14 February 1948, the 50th anniversary of the sinking of the battleship ; conversion to a Fleet Snorkel submarine during the first half of 1951; and a starring role in one of Edward R. Murrow's See It Now television shows.\\"These Roving TV Men ...\\" Popular Mechanics, July 1952, pp. 65-69/247, see p. 67. On 15 July 1952, the submarine broadened her experience by departing New London and sailing to the Mediterranean Sea for her first deployment with the 6th Fleet. After exercises with other United States warships and vessels of the navies of NATO allies during the rest of the summer, Sablefish returned to New London in October. Thereafter, she made six more deployments to the Mediterranean. When back on her home side of the Atlantic, the submarine was busy with exercises which took her as far north as Nova Scotia and south to the Caribbean. In June 1959, she was one of the Navy's representatives at the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway; and she operated in the Great Lakes until mid-August. A second cruise up the St. Lawrence returned her to the Great Lakes in 1961. In May 1967, Sablefish again headed east across the Atlantic; but this time, instead of transiting the Straits of Gibraltar for service in the 6th Fleet, she visited ports in the British Isles and along the Atlantic coast in France, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. On her homeward voyage, she also touched at Iceland. The ship began her last Mediterranean deployment in the fall of 1968 and returned to her home port on 1 February 1969. On 30 June 1969, while operating out of New London, she was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and redesignated AGSS-303. She was decommissioned there on 1 November 1969 and struck from the Navy list the same day. She was subsequently stripped and sold for scrap on 29 July 1971.

The novel imagines that the D-day landings have failed and Wales been occupied by the Nazis. Whilst working as a tiler in the South Wales valleys one summer, Sheers had heard about the Auxiliary Units- secret civilian networks that, in the event of an invasion, would have formed a British resistance, but the novel focuses not on fighting \\"but on the uneasy means of survival open to the women who are left behind\\". The film of the novel, which Sheers co-wrote, was released in autumn 2011 and starred Andrea Riseborough. Sheers insisted that the film be shot in and around the Black Mountains. In 2007, Sheers collaborated with composer Rachel Portman on The Water Diviner‚Äôs Tale, an oratorio for children which was premi√®red at the Royal Albert Hall for the BBC Proms. In 2007/8 Sheers was a Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Fellow at the New York Public Library. In 2009, Sheers published the novella 'White Ravens', a contemporary response to the myth of Branwen Daughter of Llyr, written as part of Seren's series of New Stories from the Mabinogion. He published an anthology of British landscape poetry to accompany his TV series of the same title, A Poet's Guide to Britain. Sheers has also written journalism and reportage for a variety of publications including Granta, The Guardian, Esquire, GQ, The Times and The Financial Times.

It originated in America around 1960, when urban renewal strategies were felt to be destroying the social framework needed for self-policing. Architect Oscar Newman created the concept of ‚Äòdefensible space‚Äô, developed further by criminologist C. Ray Jeffery who coined the term CPTED. Growing interest in environmental criminology led to detailed study of specific topics such as natural surveillance, access control and territoriality. The \\"broken window\\" principle that neglected zones invite crime reinforced the need for good property maintenance to assert visible ownership of space. Appropriate environmental design can also increase the perceived likelihood of detection and apprehension, known to be the biggest single deterrent to crime. And there has been new interest in the interior design of prisons as an environment that significantly affects decisions to offend. Wide-ranging recommendations to architects include the planting of trees and shrubs, the elimination of escape routes, the correct use of lighting, and the encouragement of pedestrian and bicycle traffic in streets. Tests show that the application of CPTED measures overwhelmingly reduces criminal activity. History CPTED was originally coined and formulated by criminologist C. Ray Jeffery. A more limited approach, termed defensible space, was developed concurrently by architect Oscar Newman. Both men built on the previous work of Elizabeth Wood, Jane Jacobs and Schlomo Angel. Jeffery's book, \\"Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design\\" came out in 1971, but his work was ignored throughout the 1970s. Newman's book, \\"Defensible Space: ‚Äì Crime Prevention through Urban Design\\" came out in 1972. His principles were widely adopted but with mixed success. The defensible space approach was subsequently revised with additional built environment approaches supported by CPTED. Newman represented this as CPTED and credited Jeffery as the originator of the CPTED term. Newman's CPTED-improved defensible space approach enjoyed broader success and resulted in a reexamination of Jeffery's work. Jeffery continued to expand the multi-disciplinary aspects of the approach, advances which he published, with the last one published in 1990. The Jeffery CPTED model is more comprehensive than the Newman CPTED model, which limits itself to the built environment. Later models of CPTED were developed based on the Newman Model, with criminologist Tim Crowe's being the most popular. , CPTED is popularly understood to refer strictly to the Newman/Crowe type models, with the Jeffery model treated more as multi-disciplinary approach to crime prevention which incorporates biology and psychology, a situation accepted even by Jeffery himself. (Robinson, 1996). A revision of CPTED, initiated in 1997, termed 2nd Generation CPTED, adapts CPTED to offender individuality, further indication that Jeffery's work is not popularly considered to be already a part of CPTED. in 2012 Woodbridge introduced and developed CPTED in prison and showed how design flaws allowed criminals to keep offending. =1960s= In the 1960s Elizabeth Wood developed guidelines for addressing security issues while working with the Chicago Housing Authority, placing emphasis on design features that would support natural surveillability. Her guidelines were never implemented but stimulated some of the original thinking that led to CPTED. Jane Jacobs' book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) argued that urban diversity and vitality were being destroyed by urban planners and their urban renewal strategies. She was challenging the basic tenets of urban planning of the time: that neighborhoods should be isolated from each other; that an empty street is safer than a crowded one; and that the car represents progress over the pedestrian. An editor for Architectural Forum magazine (1952‚Äì1964), she had no formal training in urban planning, but her work emerged as a founding text for a new way of seeing cities. She felt that the way cities were being designed and built meant that the general public would be unable to develop the social framework needed for effective self-policing. She pointed out that the new forms of urban design broke down many of the traditional controls on criminal behavior, for example, the ability of residents to watch the street and the presence of people using the street both night and day. She suggested that the lack of \\"natural guardianship\\" in the environment promoted crime. Jacobs developed the concept that crime flourishes when people do not meaningfully interact with their neighbors. In Death and Life, Jacobs listed the three attributes needed to make a city street safe: a clear demarcation of private and public space; diversity of use; and a high level of pedestrian use of the sidewalks. Schlomo Angel was an early pioneer of CPTED and studied under noted planner Christopher Alexander. Angel's Ph.D. thesis, Discouraging Crime Through City Planning, (1968) was a study of street crime in Oakland, CA. In it he states \\"The physical environment can exert a direct influence on crime settings by delineating territories, reducing or increasing accessibility by the creation or elimination of boundaries and circulation networks, and by facilitating surveillance by the citizenry and the police.\\" He asserted that crime was inversely related to the level of activity on the street, and that the commercial strip environment was particularly vulnerable to crime because it thinned out activity, making it easier for individuals to commit street crime. Angel developed and published CPTED concepts in 1970 in work supported and widely distributed by the United States Department of Justice (Luedtke, 1970). =1970s= The phrase crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) was first used by C. Ray Jeffery, a criminologist from Florida State University. The phrase began to gain acceptance after the publication of his 1971 book of the same name. :Jeffery's work was based on the precepts of experimental psychology represented in modern learning theory. (Jeffery and Zahm, 1993:329) Jeffery's CPTED concept arose out of his experiences with a rehabilitative project in Washington, D.C. that attempted to control the school environment of juveniles in the area. Rooted deeply in the psychological learning theory of B.F. Skinner, Jeffery's CPTED approach emphasized the role of the physical environment in the development of pleasurable and painful experiences for the offender that would have the capacity to alter behavioral outcomes. His original CPTED model was a stimulus-response (S-R) model positing that the organism learned from punishments and reinforcements in the environment. Jeffery \\"emphasized material rewards . . . and the use of the physical environment to control behavior\\" (Jeffery and Zahm, 1993:330). The major idea here was that by removing the reinforcements for crime, it would not occur. (Robinson, 1996) An often overlooked contribution of Jeffery in his 1971 book is outlining four critical factors in crime prevention that have stood the test of time. These are the degrees to which one can manipulate the opportunity for a crime to occur, the motivation for the crime to occur, the risk to the offender if the crime occurs, and the history of the offender who might consider committing the crime. The first three of these are within the control of the potential victim while the last is not. For reasons that have received little attention, Jeffery's work was ignored throughout the 1970s. Jeffery's own explanation is that, at a time when the world wanted prescriptive design solutions, his work presented a comprehensive theory and used it to identify a wide range of crime prevention functions that should drive design and management standards. Concurrent with Jeffery's largely theoretical work was Oscar Newman and George Rand's empirical study of the crime-environment connection conducted in the early 1970s. As an architect, Newman placed emphasis on the specific design features, an emphasis missing in Jeffery's work. Newman's \\"Defensible Space ‚Äì Crime Prevention through Urban Design (1972) includes extensive discussion of crime related to the physical form of housing based on crime data analysis from New York City public housing. \\"Defensible Space\\" changed the nature of the crime prevention and environmental design field and within two years of its publication substantial federal funding was made available to demonstrate and study defensible space concepts. As established by Newman, defensible space must contain two components. First, defensible space should allow people to see and be seen continuously. Ultimately, this diminishes residents' fear because they know that a potential offender can easily be observed, identified, and consequently, apprehended. Second, people must be willing to intervene or report crime when it occurs. By increasing the sense of security in settings where people live and work, it encourages people to take control of the areas and assume a role of ownership. When people feel safe in their neighborhood they are more likely to interact with one another and intervene when crime occurs. These remain central to most implementations of CPTED . In 1977, Jeffery's second edition of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design expanded his theoretical approach to embrace a more complex model of behavior in which variable physical environments, offender behavior as individuals and behavior of individual members of the general public have reciprocal influences on one another. This laid the foundation for Jeffery to develop a behavioral model aimed at predicting the effects of modifying both the external environment and the internal environment of individual offenders. =1980s= By the 1980s, the defensible space prescriptions of the 1970s were determined to have mixed effectiveness. They worked best in residential settings, especially in settings where the residents were relatively free to respond to cues to increase social interaction. Defensible space design tools were observed to be marginally effective in institutional and commercial settings. As a result, Newman and others moved to improve defensible space, adding CPTED based features. They also deemphasised less effective aspects of defensible space. Contributions to the advance of CPTED in the 1980s included: *The \\"broken windows\\" theory, put forth by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling in 1982, explored the impact that visible deterioration and neglect in neighborhoods have on behavior. Property maintenance was added as a CPTED strategy on par with surveillance, access control and territoriality. The Broken Windows theory may go hand in hand with CPTED. Crime is attracted to the areas that are not taken care of or abandoned. CPTED adds a pride of ownership feeling to the community. With no more \\"broken windows\\" in certain neighborhoods, crime will continue to decline and eventually fall out completely. *Canadian academicians Patricia and Paul Brantingham published Environmental Criminology in 1981. According to the authors, a crime takes place when all of the essential elements are present. These elements consist of: a law, an offender, a target, and a place. They characterize these as \\"the four dimensions of crime\\", with environmental criminology studying the last of the four dimensions. *British criminologists Ronald V. Clarke and Patricia Mayhew developed their \\"situational crime prevention\\" approach: reducing opportunity to offend by improving design and management of the environment. *Criminologist Timothy Crowe developed his CPTED training programs. =1990s= Criminology: An Interdisciplinary Approach (1990), was Jeffery's final contribution to CPTED. The Jeffery CPTED model evolved to one which assumes that :The environment never influences behavior directly, but only through the brain. Any model of crime prevention must include both the brain and the physical environment. ... Because the approach contained in Jeffery's CPTED model is today based on many fields, including scientific knowledge of modern brain sciences, a focus on only external environmental crime prevention is inadequate as it ignores another entire dimension of CPTED ‚Äì i.e., the internal environment. (Robinson, 1996) Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (1991) by criminologist Tim Crowe provided a solid base for CPTED to move forward into the rest of the 1990s. From 1994 through 2002, Sparta Consulting Corporation led by Severin Sorensen, CPP managed the US Government's largest CPTED technical assistance and training program titled Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) in Public Housing Technical Assistance and Training Program, funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. During this period Sorensen worked with Ronald V. Clarke and the Sparta team to develop a new CPTED Curriculum that used Situational Crime Prevention as an underlying theoretical basis for CPTED measures. A curriculum was developed and trained to stakeholders in public and assisted housing, and follow-up CPTED assessments were conducted at various sites. The Sparta-led CPTED projects showed statistical reductions in self reported FBI UCR Part I crimes between 17% to 76% depending on the basket of CPTED measures employed in specific high crime, low income settings in the United States. In 1996, Oscar Newman published an update to his earlier CPTED works, titled, Creating Defensible Space, Institute for Community Design Analysis, Office of Planning and Development Research (PDR), US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In 1997, an article by Greg Saville and Gerry Cleveland, 2nd Generation CPTED, exhorted CPTED practitioners to consider the original social ecology origins of CPTED, including social and psychological issues beyond the built environment. =2000s= , elements of the CPTED approach had gained wide international acceptance due to law enforcement efforts to embrace it. The CPTED term \\"environment\\" is commonly used to refer to the external environment of the place. Jeffery's intention that CPTED also embrace the internal environment of the offender seems to have been lost, even on those promoting the expansion of CPTED to include social ecology and psychology under the banner of 2nd Generation CPTED. In 2012 Woodbridge introduced and developed the concept of CPTED within a prison environment, a place where crime still continues after conviction. Jeffery's understanding of the criminal mind from his study in rehabilitative facilities over forty years ago was now being used to reduce crime in those same type of facilities. Woodbridge showed how prison design allowed offending to continue and introduced changes to reduce crime. CPTED techniques are increasingly benefiting from integration with design technologies. For instance, models of proposed buildings developed in Building Information Modelling may be imported into video game engines to assess their resilience to different forms of crime. Strategies for the built environment CPTED strategies rely upon the ability to influence offender decisions that precede criminal acts. Research into criminal behavior shows that the decision to offend or not to offend is more influenced by cues to the perceived risk of being caught than by cues to reward or ease of entry. Certainty of being caught is the main deterrence for criminals not the severity of the punishment so by raising the certainty of being captured, criminal actions will decrease. Consistent with this research, CPTED based strategies emphasise enhancing the perceived risk of detection and apprehension. Consistent with the widespread implementation of defensible space guidelines in the 1970s, most implementations of CPTED were based solely upon the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can reduce crime, reduce the fear of crime, and improve the quality of life. Built environment implementations of CPTED seek to dissuade offenders from committing crimes by manipulating the built environment in which those crimes proceed from or occur. The six main concepts according to Moffat are territoriality, surveillance, access control, image/maintenance, activity support and target hardening. Applying all of these strategies is key when trying to prevent crime in any neighborhood crime ridden or not. Natural surveillance and access control strategies limit the opportunity for crime. Territorial reinforcement promotes social control through a variety of measures. Image/maintenance and activity support provide the community with reassurance and the ability to inhibit crime by citizen activities. Target hardening strategies round up all of these techniques to resolve crime into one final step. =Natural surveillance= This curved street with balconies allows for additional opportunities for residents to spot suspicious activity, while also making it difficult for criminals to plan escape routes. Natural surveillance increases the perceived risk of attempting deviant actions by improving visibility of potential offenders to the general public. Natural surveillance occurs by designing the placement of physical features, activities and people in such a way as to maximize visibility of the space and its users, fostering positive social interaction among legitimate users of private and public space. Potential offenders feel increased scrutiny, and thus inherently perceive an increase in risk. This perceived increase in risk extends to the perceived lack of viable and covert escape routes. *Design streets to increase pedestrian and bicycle traffic *Place windows overlooking sidewalks and parking lots. *Leave window shades open. *Use passing vehicular traffic as a surveillance asset. *Create landscape designs that provide surveillance, especially in proximity to designated points of entry and opportunistic points of entry. *Use the shortest, least sight-limiting fence appropriate for the situation. *Use transparent weather vestibules at building entrances. *When creating lighting design, avoid poorly placed lights that create blind-spots for potential observers and miss critical areas. Ensure potential problem areas are well lit: pathways, stairs, entrances/exits, parking areas, ATMs, phone kiosks, mailboxes, bus stops, children's play areas, recreation areas, pools, laundry rooms, storage areas, dumpster and recycling areas, etc. *Avoid too-bright security lighting that creates blinding glare and/or deep shadows, hindering the view for potential observers. Eyes adapt to night lighting and have trouble adjusting to severe lighting disparities. Using lower intensity lights often requires more fixtures. *Use shielded or cut-off luminaires to control glare. *Place lighting along pathways and other pedestrian-use areas at proper heights for lighting the faces of the people in the space (and to identify the faces of potential attackers). *Utilizing curved streets with multiple view points to multiple houses' entrances, as well as making the escape route difficult to follow. Natural surveillance measures can be complemented by mechanical and organizational measures. For example, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras can be added in areas where window surveillance is unavailable. =Natural access control= A picket fence reduces access, while allowing bystanders to see suspicious activity. Natural access control limits the opportunity for crime by taking steps to clearly differentiate between public space and private space. By selectively placing entrances and exits, fencing, lighting and landscape to limit access or control flow, natural access control occurs. *Use a single, clearly identifiable, point of entry *Use structures to divert persons to reception areas *Incorporate maze entrances in public restrooms. This avoids the isolation that is produced by an anteroom or double door entry system *Use low, thorny bushes beneath ground level windows. Use rambling or climbing thorny plants next to fences to discourage intrusion. *Eliminate design features that provide access to roofs or upper levels *In the front yard, use waist-level, picket-type fencing along residential property lines to control access, encourage surveillance. *Use a locking gate between front and backyards. *Use shoulder-level, open-type fencing along lateral residential property lines between side yards and extending to between back yards. They should be sufficiently unencumbered with landscaping to promote social interaction between neighbors. *Use substantial, high, closed fencing (for example, masonry) between a backyard and a public alley instead of a wall which blocks the view from all angles. Natural access control is used to complement mechanical and operational access control measures, such as target hardening. =Natural territorial reinforcement= A dilapidated chain link fence signals that the building it is protecting is not very secured, while a well maintained bush indicates risk due to evidence of recent activity. Territorial reinforcement promotes social control through increased definition of space and improved proprietary concern. An environment designed to clearly delineate private space does two things. First, it creates a sense of ownership. Owners have a vested interest and are more likely to challenge intruders or report them to the police. Second, the sense of owned space creates an environment where \\"strangers\\" or \\"intruders\\" stand out and are more easily identified. By using buildings, fences, pavement, signs, lighting and landscape to express ownership and define public, semi-public and private space, natural territorial reinforcement occurs. Additionally, these objectives can be achieved by assignment of space to designated users in previously unassigned locations. *Maintained premises and landscaping such that it communicates an alert and active presence occupying the space. *Provide trees in residential areas. Research results indicate that, contrary to traditional views within the law enforcement community, outdoor residential spaces with more trees are seen as significantly more attractive, more safe, and more likely to be used than similar spaces without trees. *Restrict private activities to defined private areas. *Display security system signage at access points. *Avoid chain link fencing and razor-wire fence topping, as it communicates the absence of a physical presence and a reduced risk of being detected. *Placing amenities such as seating or refreshments in common areas in a commercial or institutional setting helps to attract larger numbers of desired users. *Scheduling activities in common areas increases proper use, attracts more people and increases the perception that these areas are controlled. *Motion sensor lights at all entry points into the residence. Territorial reinforcement measures make the normal user feel safe and make the potential offender aware of a substantial risk of apprehension or scrutiny. When people take pride in what they own and go to the proper measures to protect their belongings, crime is deterred from those areas because now it makes it more of a challenge. Criminals don't want their job to be hard, because if it was hard, then they wouldn't do it. The more difficult it is to commit a crime in certain areas, the less crime will occur. =Other CPTED elements= Maintenance and activity support aspects of CPTED were touched upon in the preceding, but are often treated separately because they are not physical design elements within the built environment. Maintenance Maintenance is an expression of ownership of property. Deterioration indicates less control by the intended users of a site and indicate a greater tolerance of disorder. The Broken Windows Theory is a valuable tool in understanding the importance of maintenance in deterring crime. Broken Windows theory proponents support a zero tolerance approach to property maintenance, observing that the presence of a broken window will entice vandals to break more windows in the vicinity. The sooner broken windows are fixed, the less likely it is that such vandalism will occur in the future. Vandalism falls into the broken windows category as well. The faster the graffiti is painted over, the less likely one is to repeat because no one saw what has been done. Having a positive image in the community shows a sense of pride and self-worth that no one can take away from the owner of the property. Activity support Activity support increases the use of a built environment for safe activities with the intent of increasing the risk of detection of criminal and undesirable activities. Natural surveillance by the intended users is casual and there is no specific plan for people to watch out for criminal activity. By placing signs such as caution children playing and signs for certain activities in the area, the citizens of that area will be more involved in what is happening around them. They will be more tuned in to who is and who isn't supposed to be there and what looks suspicious on a day-to-day life. Effectiveness and criticism CPTED strategies are most successful when they inconvenience the end user the least and when the CPTED design process relies upon the combined efforts of environmental designers, land managers, community activists, and law enforcement professionals. The strategies listed above can't be fulfilled without the community's help and it requires the whole community in the location to make the environment a safer place to live. A meta-analysis of multiple-component CPTED initiatives in the United States has found that they have decreased robberies between 30 and 84% (Casteel and Peek-Asa, 2000).Casteel, Carri and Corinne Peek-Asa. 2000. ‚ÄúEffectiveness of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) in reducing robberies.‚Äù American Journal of Preventive Medicine 18(4S): 99‚Äì115.Morrison, A. 2007. Alternate View Paper Violence and Crime in Latin America, World Bank Solution Paper. \\"\\" In terms of effectiveness, a more accurate title for the strategy would be crime deterrence through environmental design. Research demonstrates that offenders might not always be prevented from committing some crimes by using CPTED. CPTED relies upon changes to the physical environment that will cause an offender to make certain behavioral decisions, and some of those decisions will include desisting from crime. Those changes are crafted so as to encourage behavior, and thus they deter rather than conclusively \\"prevent\\" behavior. Beyond the attraction of being cost effective in lowering the incidence of crime, CPTED typically reduces the overall costs of preventing crime. Retrofitting an existing environment to meet CPTED can sometimes be costly, but when incorporated in the original design phase of facility planning, cost of designing to CPTED principles are often lower than with traditional approaches. Operational costs are often lower also, as CPTED lighting designs can significantly lower energy use. Adding to the attraction of CPTED is that it lowers liability. At times the entire street style must be changed and buildings have to be up to code with more windows and changing their view and access points to other areas around the building like the parking lot or store front.

Camera trapping studies carried out in several protected areas in Taiwan between 1997 and 2012 did not reveal the presence of a clouded leopard. The population is listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List. It was first described in 1862 on the basis of a traded skin with an incomplete tail. Its fur colour is pale to tawny, and it has large cloud-like markings on the shoulders and flanks with a few spots within the clouds.  Characteristics  In his first description of four Formosan clouded leopard skins, Robert Swinhoe noted the shortness of its tail, which is about one-half the length of clouded leopard specimens from the Himalayas. It was Taiwan's second-largest carnivore, after the Formosan black bear.  Last efforts Specimen in the National Taiwan Museum An interview survey conducted in 1986 among 70 Taiwanese aboriginal hunters revealed that they sighted a Formosan clouded leopard in the Tawu Mountain area in 1983 for the last time. In 1989, the skin of a young individual was found in the Taroko National Park area, which is the last confirmed record. Pugmarks reported in the 1990s near Yushan National Park were suspected, but not confirmed to be of a clouded leopard. It has been assumed that clouded leopards retreated into the Yushan Range and Tawu Mountain after extensive logging of natural habitat. Today, the Tawu Mountain Nature Reserve is a protected area encompassing about . It harbours the largest remaining primary forest in southern Taiwan and comprises tropical and subtropical rainforest as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forest and temperate coniferous forest. Between 1997 and 2012, camera trapping surveys were conducted in more than 1,450 sites in potentially suitable habitats across Taiwan, from the seashore to an altitude of , in fragmented lowlands and inside protected areas. This survey also included 13,000 camera trap nights between 2000 and 2004 in Tawu Mountain Nature Reserve and the adjacent Twin Ghost Lake Important Wildlife Area. During a nationwide survey effort of 128,349 camera trap days, 12 potential prey species were recorded including sambar (Rusa unicolor), Formosan serow (Capricornis swinhoei), Reeves's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), Formosan macaque (Macaca cyclopis) Swinhoe's pheasant (Lophura swinhoii) and rodents. However, not a single clouded leopard was recorded. It is therefore considered extinct. Owing to the relative rarity of reports of live Formosan clouded leopards even when it was extant, there is a hypothesis among some researchers that the Formosan clouded leopard never existed, and that the pelts frequently worn by indigenous communities were Sunda clouded leopard pelts that were being traded between the Sunda Islands, China, and Japan. However, this is not widely accepted, as several records of live clouded leopards on the island exist. It was reported that 24 clouded leopards were shot during the 1933 occupation of Taiwan by Japanese forces. = Alleged sightings = In summer of 2018, two different groups of rangers allegedly sighted a clouded leopard in Taitung County. One group claimed to have seen an individual climbing a tree and hunting goats on a cliff. The other group contended to have observed an individual darting past a scooter on a road and climbing into a tree.

Health L. Rev. 12 (2015): 227. The term originally denoted a barrier used to stop the spread of infectious diseases. The term is also often used metaphorically, in English, to refer to attempts to prevent the spread of an ideology deemed unwanted or dangerous,Harold H. Fisher, Famine in Soviet Russia, Macmillan: New York, 1927; p. 25 such as the containment policy adopted by George F. Kennan against the Soviet Union.  Origin  The term cordon sanitaire dates to 1821, when the Duke de Richelieu deployed French troops to the border between France and Spain, allegedly to prevent yellow fever from spreading into France. Definition A cordon sanitaire is generally created around an area experiencing an epidemic or an outbreak of infectious disease, or along the border between two nations. Once the cordon is established, people from the affected area are no longer allowed to leave or enter it. In the most extreme form, the cordon is not lifted until the infection is extinguished. Traditionally, the line around a cordon sanitaire was quite physical; a fence or wall was built, armed troops patrolled, and inside, inhabitants were left to battle the affliction without help. In some cases, a \\"reverse cordon sanitaire\\" (also known as protective sequestration) may be imposed on healthy communities that are attempting to keep an infection from being introduced. Public health specialists have included cordon sanitaire along with quarantine and medical isolation as \\"nonpharmaceutical interventions\\" designed to prevent the transmission of microbial pathogens through social distancing. The cordon sanitaire is rarely used now because of our improved understanding of disease transmission, treatment and prevention. It remains a useful intervention under conditions in which: 1) the infection is highly virulent (contagious and likely to cause illness); 2) the case fatality rate is very high; 3) treatment is nonexistent or difficult; and 4) there is no vaccine, or other means of immunizing large numbers of people (such as needles or syringes) are lacking. During the COVID-19 pandemic cordons sanitaires were imposed on geographic regions around the world in an attempt to contain the infection.Robert P. Baird, \\"What It Means to Contain and Mitigate the Coronavirus.\\" The New Yorker, March 11, 2020 =16th century= * In 1523, during a plague outbreak in Birgu, the town was cordoned off by guards to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of Malta. =17th century= * In 1655, cordon sanitaire was imposed on the town of ≈ªabbar in Malta after a plague outbreak was detected. The disease spread to other settlements and similar restrictive measures were imposed, and the outbreak was successfully contained after causing 20 deaths. * In May 1666, the English village of Eyam famously imposed a cordon sanitaire on itself after an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the community. During the next 14 months almost eighty percent of the inhabitants died. A perimeter of stones was laid out surrounding the village and no one passed the boundary in either direction until November 1667, when the pestilence had run its course. Neighbouring communities provided food for Eyam, leaving supplies in designated locations along the boundary cordon and receiving payment in coins \\"disinfected\\" by running water or vinegar. =18th century= * During the Great Northern War plague outbreak of 1708‚Äì1712, cordons sanitaires were established around affected towns like Stralsund and K√∂nigsberg; one was also established around the whole Duchy of Prussia and another one between Scania and the Danish isles along the Sound, with Saltholm as the central quarantine station.Karl-Erik Frandsen, The Last Plague in the Baltic Region, 1709‚Äì1713. Museum Tusculanum Press, 2010. * In 1770 the Empress Maria Theresa set up a cordon sanitaire between Austria and the Ottoman Empire to prevent people and goods infected with plague from crossing the border. Cotton and wool were held in storehouses for weeks, with peasants paid to sleep on the bales and monitored to see if they showed signs of disease. Travelers were quarantined for 21 days under ordinary circumstances and up to 48 days when there was confirmation of plague being active in Ottoman territory. The cordon was maintained until 1871, and there were no major outbreaks of plague in Austrian territory after the cordon sanitaire was established, whereas the Ottoman Empire continued to suffer frequent epidemics of plague until the mid-nineteenth century. * During the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic, roads and bridges leading to the city were blocked off by soldiers from the local militia to prevent the illness from spreading.

The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) was a passenger railway that served London from 1868 to 1933. Established in 1864 to complete the inner circle, an underground railway in London, the first part of the line opened using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. The Metropolitan Railway operated all services until the District introduced its own trains in 1871. The railway was soon extended westwards through Earl's Court to Fulham, Richmond, Ealing and Hounslow. After completing the inner circle and reaching Whitechapel in 1884, it was extended to Upminster in Essex in 1902. To finance electrification at the beginning of the 20th century, American financier Charles Yerkes took it over and made it part of his Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) group. Electric propulsion was introduced in 1905, and by the end of the year electric multiple units operated all of the services. On 1 July 1933, the District Railway and the other UERL railways were merged with the Metropolitan Railway and the capital's tramway and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board. Today, former District Railway tracks and stations are used by the London Underground's District, Piccadilly and Circle lines. History =Origins, 1863‚Äì1886= Inner Circle In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met) opened the world's first underground railway. The line was built from Paddington beneath the New Road, connecting the main line railway termini at , and King's Cross. Then it followed Farringdon Road to a station at Farringdon Street in Smithfield, near the capital's financial heart in the City. alt=In this drawing the railway is shown on the left, underground in a rectangular tunnel. On the right is the Thames and between them is a wall and earth. The Met's early success prompted a flurry of applications to parliament in 1863 for new railways in London, many competing for similar routes. The House of Lords established a select committee that recommended an \\"inner circuit of railway that should abut, if not actually join, nearly all of the principal railway termini in the Metropolis\\". For the 1864 parliamentary session, railway schemes were presented that met the recommendation in varying ways and a joint committee composed of members of both Houses of Parliament reviewed the options. Proposals to extend west and then south from Paddington to South Kensington and east from Moorgate to Tower Hill were accepted and received Royal Assent on 29 July 1864. To complete the circuit, the committee encouraged the amalgamation of two schemes proposed to run via different routes between Kensington and the City and a combined proposal under the name Metropolitan District Railway was agreed on the same day. Initially, the District and the Met were closely associated and it was intended that they would soon merge. The Met's chairman and three other directors were on the board of the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract. The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met. Unlike the Metropolitan, the route did not follow an easy alignment under existing roads and land values were higher, so compensation payments for property were much higher. Major landowners, including Lord Kensington, sold parcels of land to the railway company. To ensure ventilation, the line west of Gloucester Road was carried in open cuttings, the rest mainly in a cut and cover tunnel wide and deep; at the stations the platform ends were left open. Construction costs and compensation payments were so high that the cost of the first section of the District from South Kensington to Westminster was ¬£3 million, almost three times the cost of the Met's original, longer line. On 24 December 1868, the District opened its line from South Kensington to Westminster, with stations at South Kensington, Sloane Square, Victoria, St. James's Park and Westminster Bridge (now Westminster), the Met extending eastwards from Brompton to a shared station at South Kensington on the same day. alt=The railway line is in the shape of the letter C. The top of the C, between Kensington (High Street) in the west and Moorgate Street in the east was run by the Metropolitan Railway, and the bottom of the C, between South Kensington and Mansion House by the District. Between Kensington (High Street) and South Kensington the two railways overlap, the companies having their own track. Junctions with the Met are shown at Baker Street and east of Paddington and with the District near Earl's Court. The District also had parliamentary permission to extend westward from Brompton (Gloucester Road) station and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a single track line from there to West Brompton on the West London Railway. There were no intermediate stations and this service initially operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 additional tracks had been laid between South Kensington and Brompton (Gloucester Road) and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton (Gloucester Road) and Kensington (High Street). East of Westminster, the next section ran in the newly constructed Victoria Embankment built by the Metropolitan Board of Works along the north bank of the River Thames. The line was opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 with stations at Charing Cross (now Embankment), The Temple (now Temple) and Blackfriars. The Met initially operated all services, receiving 55 per cent of the gross receipts for a fixed level of service. The District were also charged for any extra trains and the District's share of the income dropped to about 40 per cent. The District's level of debt meant that merger was no longer attractive to the Met and its directors resigned from the District's board. To improve its finances, the District gave the Met notice to terminate the operating agreement. Struggling under the burden of high construction costs, the District was unable to continue with the original scheme to reach Tower Hill and made a final extension of its line one station further east from Blackfriars to a previously unplanned City terminus at Mansion House. On Saturday 1 July 1871, an opening banquet was attended by the Prime Minister William Gladstone, who was also a shareholder. The following Monday, Mansion House opened and the District began running its own trains. From this date, the two companies operated a joint inner circle service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Edgware Road that ran every ten minutes. This was supplemented by a District service every ten minutes between Mansion House and West Brompton, and Hammersmith & City Railway and Great Western Railway (GWR) suburban services between Edgware Road and Moorgate Street. The permissions for the railway east of Mansion House were allowed to lapse. At the other end of the line, the District part of South Kensington station opened on 10 July 1871 and Earl's Court station opened on the West Brompton extension on 30 October 1871. West to Putney Bridge, Richmond, Ealing and Hounslow The District Railway's main expansion was to the west. A small station at Earl's Court, between Gloucester Road and West Brompton, opened on 31 October 1871 with three platforms. Lillie Bridge depot, opened in 1872, was built parallel to the West London Joint Railway and initially accessed by a curve onto the West London Line. This curve allowed, from 1 February 1872, the London & North Western Railway (L&NWR;) to run a half- hourly outer circle service from Broad Street to Mansion House via , Addison Road and Earls Court. From 1 October 1872, the GWR also ran a half-hourly middle circle service from the Met's Moorgate Street station to Mansion House via Paddington and Earl's Court. Permission to build a railway long to Hammersmith was granted on 7 July 1873, the independent Hammersmith Extension Railway having been formed to raise the necessary capital. The new line started from a junction on the curve to Addison Road and also allowed easier access to Lillie Bridge Depot. It opened on 9 September 1874 with one intermediate station at North End (Fulham) (renamed West Kensington in 1877) and a terminus at Hammersmith, and was served by through trains to Mansion House. West Brompton was now served by a shuttle to Earl's Court. Earl's Court station burnt down in 1875 and a larger replacement with four tracks and two island platforms opened on 1 February 1878. This was sited to the west of the original station; to the east of the station a flying junction was built to separate traffic to Kensington (High Street) and from Gloucester Road. In December 1876, six trains per hour ran on the inner circle between Mansion House and Aldgate. The District operated four trains per hour from Mansion House to Hammersmith. Also leaving every hour from Mansion House were two GWR middle circle services to Aldgate via Addison Road and two L&NWR; services to Broad Street via Willesden Junction. Three services an hour travelled between West Brompton and Earl's Court. alt=Richmond is shown on the bottom left and a blue line (L&SWR;) is goes up the page then right until Hammersmith is reached. At Hammersmith the blue curves sharply north, travels through Hammersmith station and then curves around until it meets a north ‚Äì south black line (WLR) in a southerly direction. Just before the Hammersmith station the District Railway is shown continuing straight on, through its own station, before continuing to Earl's Court. In 1864 the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;) had obtained permission for a railway to serve Richmond. The route headed north from Addison Road on the West London Railway before curving round to serve Hammersmith at a station at (linked to the Hammersmith & City Railway station by footbridge), Turnham Green, Brentford Road (Gunnersbury from 1871) and Kew Gardens and Richmond. The line opened on 1 January 1869, the L&SWR; running services from Waterloo and Ludgate Hill via Addison Road, and the L&NWR; running services from Broad Street to Richmond from a link at Brentford Road to the North London Line at South Acton. Stations opened on the line at Shaftesbury Road (Ravenscourt Park from 1888) and Shepherds Bush on 1 May 1874. In 1875 permission was given for a link from the District station at Hammersmith to a junction just east of Ravenscourt Park. As the L&SWR; line was on a viaduct and the District line in a cutting, the line rose steeply. On 1 June 1877, the Hammersmith branch was extended to Richmond, initially with a service of one train an hour to Mansion House. The Met and GWR Hammersmith & City line had access by a link just north of their Hammersmith station and diverted a service to Richmond from 1 October 1877. From 1 May 1878 to 30 September 1880, the Midland Railway operated a circular service from to Earl's Court via Dudding Hill, Acton and the L&SWR; to Hammersmith. In 1879 the District opened a junction west of L&SWR;'s Turnham Green station for a line to Ealing. With stations at Acton Green (now Chiswick Park), Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town), Ealing Common and Ealing Broadway, the Ealing station was built just north of the GWR station. On 4 July 1878, permission was granted to extend the West Brompton branch as far as the Thames. Stations opened at Walham Green (now Fulham Broadway), Parsons Green. The line terminated at Putney Bridge & Fulham (now Putney Bridge). The line opened on 1 March 1880, in time for the University Boat Race held that year on 22 March. Initially the service was two trains an hour to Mansion House, supplemented from 1 April by two trains an hour to High Street Kensington. alt=This map shows the Hounslow branch starting from Mill Hill Park on the Ealing Broadway route before heading west through several stations. A short branch terminates at Hounslow Town; a route west runs through Heston Heathrow before terminating at Hounslow Barracks. In 1866, permission had been granted to landowners in the Hounslow area for a Hounslow and Metropolitan Railway to connect to a proposed Acton & Brentford Railway. However, this had never been built, but with the District now at Acton there was an alternative. Permission was granted in 1880 for a nearly railway from Mill Hill Park station to Hounslow Barracks, with stations at South Ealing, Boston Road and Spring Grove, and agreement reached for the District to work the line. On 1 May 1883 the District started a service to Hounslow Town, calling at South Ealing, Boston Road (now Boston Manor) and Osterley & Spring Grove (replaced by Osterley). A single-track line from junction near Hounslow Town to Hounslow Barracks (now Hounslow West) opened a year later in 1884. Traffic was light and Hounslow Barracks was initially served by a shuttle to Osterley & Spring Grove that connected to an off-peak Hounslow Town to Mill Hill Park train. Hounslow Town station closed in 1886 and Heston Hounslow station (now Hounslow Central) opened. From 1 March 1883 to 30 September 1885, via a connection to the GWR tracks at Ealing, the District ran a service to Windsor. =Expansion, 1874‚Äì1900= Completing the circle The joint line (shown in blue) that completed the inner circle in 1884 and gave the Metropolitan and District Railways access to the East London Railway. The Met's station at the Tower of London was closed soon after the line was opened. District services were extended east of Whitechapel over the alt=The joint railway is shown between Mansion House and Whitechapel. Continuing from an end on junction with the District at Mansion House it passes through stations and as it passes Aldgate a junction allows access to the station before the line to continues east. When it reaches Whitechapel the line curves south to join the East London Railway. Conflict between the Met and the District and the expense of construction delayed the completion of the inner circle. In 1874, frustrated City financiers formed the Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway Company with the aim of finishing the route. The company was supported by the District railway and obtained parliamentary authority on 7 August 1874, but struggled with funding. The time allowed was extended in 1876. A meeting between the District and Metropolitan was held in 1877, the Met now wishing to access the South Eastern Railway (SER) via the East London Railway (ELR). Both companies promoted and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1879 for the extension and a link to the ELR. The Act also ensured future co-operation by allowing both companies access to the whole circle. A large contribution was made by authorities for road and sewer improvements. In 1882 the Met extended its line from Aldgate to a temporary station at Tower of London. Two contracts to build joint lines were placed, one from Mansion House to the Tower in 1882 and a second from the circle north of Aldgate to Whitechapel with a curve onto the ELR in 1883. From 1 October 1884 the District and Metropolitan began local services from St Mary's via this curve onto the East London Railway to SER's New Cross station. After an official opening ceremony on 17 September and trial running, a circular service started on Monday 6 October 1884. On the same day the District extended its services to Whitechapel and over the ELR to New Cross, calling at new joint stations at Aldgate East and St Mary's. Joint stations opened on the circle line at Cannon Street, Eastcheap (Monument from 1 November 1884) and Mark Lane. The Met's Tower of London station closed on 12 October 1884 after the District refused to sell tickets to the station. After opening the District service from New Cross four trains an hour ran alternately to Hammersmith or Putney, but as passenger demand was low after a month this was reduced to two trains an hour to Ealing. Four trains an hour went from Whitechapel, two to Putney, one to Hammersmith and one to Richmond. The middle and outer circle services continued operating from Mansion House at two per hour each. Initially the inner circle service was eight trains an hour, completing the circuit in 81‚Äì84 minutes, but this proved impossible to maintain and service was reduced to six trains an hour with a 70-minute timing in 1885. Initially guards were permitted no relief breaks during their shift until September 1885 when they were permitted three 20-minute breaks. South to Wimbledon and east to East Ham Several schemes to cross the Thames at Putney Bridge to Guildford, Surbiton or Wimbledon had been proposed and received approval from Parliament, although the District had been unable to raise the necessary funding. In 1886 the L&SWR; replaced these plans with the Wimbledon and Fulham Railway that started on the west side of Wimbledon and crossing Thames to meet the District's Putney Bridge station. The line had intermediate stations at Wimbledon Park, Southfields and East Putney and a junction connected the line to the L&SWR;'s Waterloo to Reading Line just north of East Putney station. The District had running rights and extended some Putney services to Wimbledon on 3 June 1889. In 1897 the nominally independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received permission for a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR;) at an above-ground junction at Bow, to the west of Bromley station. The LT&SR; and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train each morning and evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900. The District sought to serve Harrow and Uxbridge and in 1892 a route from Ealing to Roxeth (South Harrow) was surveyed and a bill presented in the name of the nominally independent Ealing and South Harrow Railway (E&SHR;). Construction started in 1897 and by the end of 1899 it was largely complete, but with low traffic prospects remained unopened. To reach Uxbridge a line from South Harrow via Ruislip was authorised in 1897. The District had problems raising the finance and the Metropolitan offered a rescue package whereby they would build a branch from Harrow to Rayners Lane and take over the line to Uxbridge, with the District retaining running rights for up to three trains an hour. The Metropolitan built the railway to Uxbridge and began running services on 4 July 1904. =Electrification, 1900‚Äì1906= Development alt=A three- quarter black-and-white photograph of a train standing at a station, showing the end carriage with windows at the end. At the start of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan railways faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties. The District found an investor to finance the upgrade in 1901, American Charles Yerkes. On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised ¬£1 million to carry out the electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level conductor rail similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted. The District had permission for a deep-level tube beneath the sub-surface line between Earl's Court and Mansion House and in 1898 bought the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway with authority for a tube from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. These plans were combined with those of the Great Northern and Strand Railway, a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Wood Green, to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR;). The section of the District's deep-level tube from South Kensington to Mansion house was dropped from plans. In April 1902, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established, with Yerkes as chairman, to control these companies and manage the planned works. On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the Traction Company and paid off the company's shareholders with cash and UERL shares. Originally built with four chimneys, alt=A large red-brick building with a double-pitched roof stretches into the distance. Two cylindrical chimneys reach high into the sky. The UERL built a large power station that would be capable of providing power for the District lines and the underground lines planned. Work began in 1902 at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity at 11 kV Hz, conveyed by high voltage cables to substations that converted this to approximately 550V DC. While the power station was being built, the District electrified the Ealing to Harrow line that was not yet open. It was equipped with automatic signalling using track circuits and pneumatic semaphore signals, and trials were run with two seven car trains. In August 1903, an order was placed for 420 cars and a new maintenance depot was built west of Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town). After the trials, the line to South Harrow opened in June 1903, from 23 June with a shuttle to Park Royal & Twyford Abbey (now Park Royal) for that year's Royal Agricultural Show. The rest of the line to South Harrow opened the following week on 28 June, with stations at North Ealing, Park Royal & Twyford Abbey, Perivale-Alperton (now Alperton), Sudbury Town, Sudbury Hill and South Harrow. Electric services Electric services began on 13 June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton, using the line from Mill Hill Park to South Acton for a passenger service for the first time. Hounslow Town station was reopened, trains reversing at the station before continuing to Hounslow Barracks using a new single track curve. On 1 July 1905 electric trains began running from Ealing to Whitechapel, and on the same day the Metropolitan and District railways both introduced electric units on the inner circle. However, a Metropolitan multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District Railway, and investigation showed an incompatibility between the way the shoe-gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District Railway track, and the Met trains were withdrawn from the District lines. After modification the Met returned and electric trains took over on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from seventy to fifty minutes. By September, after withdrawing services over the unelectrified East London Line and the east of East Ham, the District were running electric services on all remaining routes. From December 1905 the L&NWR; service was hauled by electric locomotives from Mansion House to Earl's Court, where a L&NWR; steam locomotive took over. In 1907 the weekday off-peak service was four trains per hour from East Ham to Ealing Broadway, four per hour from Mansion House to alternately Richmond and Wimbledon and two per hour from Wimbledon to High Street Kensington and Ealing Broadway to Whitechapel. Four trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to Earl's Court, two continuing to High Street Kensington. From South Harrow there were two trains per hour to Mill Hill Park, and four trains per hour from Hounslow Barracks to Mill Hill Park, two of these continuing to South Acton. Meanwhile, the UERL's GNP&BR; tube railway was under construction, surfacing west of West Kensington and entering two terminal platforms on the north side of the District's Hammersmith station. A new station, Barons Court, was built with two island platforms, one for each railway. As there was space at Lillie Bridge Depot after the District had moved to Mill Hill Park, the GNP&BR; took over part of the site for its depot. Barons Court opened 9 October 1905 and the tube railway opened as the Piccadilly line on 15 December 1906. =London Underground, 1908‚Äì1933= Running an electric railway alt=A map titled \\"London Underground Railways\\" showing each of the underground railway lines in a different colour with stations marked as blobs. Faint background detail shows the River Thames, roads and non-underground lines. In 1908 the UERL and the other underground railway companies in London came to a joint marketing arrangement that included maps, joint publicity and combined ticketing. UNDERGROUND signs were used outside stations in Central London. The UERL eventually controlled all underground railways in London except the Waterloo & City Railway, the Metropolitan Railway and its subsidiary the Great Northern & City Railway, and introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar. 'Non-stop' working was introduced on the District in December 1907. Usually just a few stations were missed; trains were marked NON STOP or ALL STATIONS as appropriate and panels beside the doors listed the stations the train would skip. East of Bow Road station the District shared the tracks with steam engines and widening the railway to East Ham was considered essential. Four tracks were laid and two electrified as far as Barking, where the Tilbury and Upminster routes separated. On 1 April 1908 District trains were extended through to Barking and the work was largely finished in July 1908. After 2 May 1909 trains no longer reversed at Hounslow Town after the station was closed and a new Hounslow Town station opened on the direct route. Since 1904, after the District had notified the Met that it would not use its running rights on the Uxbridge line with steam trains, it had not run services, although it paid the ¬£2,000 a year that was due under the enabling Act. When the District suggested running as far as Rayners Lane, the Met responded with a proposal to rebuild the station as a District terminus. The District proposed running trains through to Uxbridge, leading to negotiations about the charges for traction current before District services were extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910. In 1910 a platform was built at Mill Hill Park for the Hounslow and Uxbridge shuttles and a flying junction built north of the station to separate the Ealing and Hounslow traffic. The station was renamed Acton Town on 1 March 1910. Between Turnham Green and Ravenscourt Park the District shared tracks with L&SWR; steam trains to Richmond, a GWR steam service from Richmond to Ladbroke Grove and Midland coal trains. The District and L&SWR; agreed to quadruple the tracks to allow a pair for the District's sole use and build a station on the District tracks at Stamford Brook. The line was first used on 3 December 1911 and Stamford Brook opened on 1 February 1912. However, the GWR had already withdrawn their service and L&SWR; was to withdraw in 1916. A flying junction separating the Richmond and Hammersmith routes west of Earl's Court opened in January 1914. From 1910 to 1939 the ran through trains from Ealing Broadway to Southend or Shoeburyness, hauled to Barking by the District's electric locomotives that were no longer needed for the L&NWR;'s outer circle service, then pulled by steam locomotive. From 1912 two specially built sets of saloon coaches with retention toilets were used. In the 1920s the off-peak weekday service was a train every ten minutes from Wimbledon and Ealing and every fifteen minutes from Richmond. Six trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to High Street Kensington. Trains from Hounslow left every 6‚Äì8 minutes, terminating at Acton Town or South Acton. Six trains per hour left Hammersmith for South Harrow, three continuing to Uxbridge. In 1925 the inner circle service was ten trains per hour in each direction, but this frequency of service caused problems. A reduction to eight would leave the Kensington High Street to Edgware Road section with too few trains. However the Metropolitan had recently rebuilt it with four platforms as part of an abandoned plan for a tube to Kilburn. The District extended its Putney to High Street service to Edgware Road and the Metropolitan provided all inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains per hour. In 1923 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway had inherited the line to Barking, and in 1929 proposed quadrupling the line to Upminster and electrifying one pair of tracks for use by the District. On 12 September 1932 services started with new stations at Upney and Heathway (now Dagenham Heathway) with platforms only on the District tracks. Piccadilly line extension In November 1912 a bill was published that included a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L&SWR;'s Richmond branch tracks. The bill passed as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913, although the advent of World War I prevented work on the extension. alt=A simple rectangular brick structure with four openings, glass above continues to the roof; the roof is a concrete slab that overhangs the walls. Powers were renewed in 1926 for four tracks from Hammersmith to west of Acton Town, with the concept of the Piccadilly running non-stop on the inner pair. The proposed service split, with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow, was clarified by 1929. District services would run mainly through to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow and Ealing, with shuttles from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton. With finance guaranteed by the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act of 1929, construction started in 1930. Four tracks were built from Studland Road junction to Northfields on the Hounslow branch. At the junction at Turnham Green for Richmond eastbound freight loops were built for coal trains to Kensington. Acton Town was rebuilt with five platforms, and a depot was built west of Northfields station. Several stations were rebuilt in a Modernist style influenced or designed by Charles Holden, who was inspired by examples of Modernist architecture in mainland Europe. This influence can be seen in the bold vertical and horizontal forms, which were combined with the use of traditional materials like brick. Holden called them 'brick boxes with concrete lids'. Today, several of these Holden-designed stations are listed buildings, including the prototype Sudbury Town listed as Grade II*. On 4 July 1932 the District service from Acton Town to South Harrow was withdrawn and one in three Piccadilly trains extended from Hammersmith to South Harrow, the District continuing to run a shuttle from South Harrow to Uxbridge. On 18 December 1932 all four tracks to Northfields opened and from 9 January 1933 Piccadilly trains started to run to Northfields, continuing to Hounslow West from 13 March 1933. District trains continued to run through to Hounslow off-peak, with a shuttle from South Acton. =London Passenger Transport Board, 1933= The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the group. To protect the UERL group's income, its chairman Lord Ashfield lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take control of the LCC's tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The Board was a compromise ‚Äì public ownership but not full nationalisation ‚Äì and came into existence on 1933. On this date, ownership of the assets of the District and the other Underground companies transferred to the LPTB. =Legacy= The railway became the District line of London Transport. From 23 October 1933 a Piccadilly line service replaced the Harrow to Uxbridge District shuttle. In 1923 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) had taken over the L&NWR; railway's outer circle service from Earl's Court and by the Second World War this had been cut back to an electrified Earl's Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Following bombing of the West London Line in 1940 the LMS and the Metropolitan line services to Addison Road were both suspended. After the war, to serve the Kensington exhibition halls a District line shuttle service started from Earl's Court to Addison Road, now renamed Kensington Olympia. The off-peak District Hounslow branch shuttle to South Acton was discontinued on 29 April 1935 and replaced by an Acton Town to South Acton shuttle. This shuttle was withdrawn on 28 February 1959, and the peak hour District line through service to Hounslow was withdrawn on 9 October 1964. In the 1970s the Hounslow branch became the Heathrow branch when it was extended to serve Heathrow Airport, first on 19 July 1975 to serve Hatton Cross and then on 16 December 1977 when Heathrow Central opened. Later on 27 March 2008, the branch was extended to Heathrow Terminal 5. Rolling stock =Steam locomotives= When in 1871 the District Railway needed its own locomotives, they ordered twenty four condensing steam locomotives from Beyer Peacock similar to the A Class locomotives the Metropolitan Railway was using on the route. As they were intended for an underground railway, the locomotives did not have cabs, but had a weatherboard with a bent-back top. The back plate of the bunker was raised to provide protection when running bunker first. A total of fifty four locomotives were purchased. They were still in service in 1905 when the line was electrified, and all but six were sold the following year. =Electric locomotives= In 1905 the District bought ten bogie box cab locomotives that looked similar to their multiple units but were only long. They were manufactured by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company and most had a single cab at one end. Consequently, they were operated in pairs, coupled back to back with the cabs at the outer end. The locomotives were used to haul L&NWR; passenger trains on the electrified section of the Outer Circle route between Earl's Court and Mansion House. After December 1908 these services terminated at Earl's Court. The locomotives were used to haul District trains, one coupled to each end of a rake of four trailer cars. From 1910 the locomotives were used on London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR;) trains extended over the District line, taking over from steam locomotives at Barking. =Carriages= The steam carriages were four wheeled, long over the buffers. First, second and third class compartments were available. First class carriages had four compartments, the others five. Lighting was initially provided by burning coal gas held in bags on the roof, later by a pressurised oil gas system. At first they were fitted with a chain brake. This was replaced by the simple Westinghouse brake and then a fully automatic Westinghouse brake. Initially trains were made up of eight carriages, but after 1879 nine became the standard. At the end of 1905 the District replaced 395 carriages with electric multiple units. A preserved carriage at the Kent and East Sussex Railway was thought to be a District Railway first class, but now thought likely to be a cutdown Metropolitan Railway eight wheeler. =Electric multiple units= In 1903 the District tested two seven-car trains with different control and brake systems on its unopened line between Ealing and South Harrow. Access to the car was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand-operated sliding doors on the car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925. The District Railway ordered 60 x 7-car electric trains in 1903. A third of the vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by sliding doors, double doors in the centre and single doors at either end. First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with an equal number of motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off-peak. By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three hand-operated double sliding doors on each side. alt=A black-and-white photograph showing a 6-car train at a station. There are detail differences in the carriages, the leading car, unlike the others, has its clerestory extended to the car end and the 3rd and 5th carriage sides are flared at the bottom. In 1923 fifty motor car bodies were ordered to allow some of the original 1904‚Äì05 car bodies to be scrapped. From 1926 two stock pools were created. Main line trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910‚Äì14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified 'local stock' worked the shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow. In 1932 the line to Upminster was electrified and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935‚Äì40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors to most of the District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957. a driving motor car built in 1923 is a static exhibit at London Transport Museum at Covent Garden.

A type of heat treating, quenching prevents undesired low-temperature processes, such as phase transformations, from occurring. It does this by reducing the window of time during which these undesired reactions are both thermodynamically favorable, and kinetically accessible; for instance, quenching can reduce the crystal grain size of both metallic and plastic materials, increasing their hardness. In metallurgy, quenching is most commonly used to harden steel by inducing a martensite transformation, where the steel must be rapidly cooled through its eutectoid point, the temperature at which austenite becomes unstable. In steel alloyed with metals such as nickel and manganese, the eutectoid temperature becomes much lower, but the kinetic barriers to phase transformation remain the same. This allows quenching to start at a lower temperature, making the process much easier. High speed steel also has added tungsten, which serves to raise kinetic barriers, which among other effects gives material properties (hardness and abrasion resistance) as though the workpiece had been cooled more rapidly than it really has. Even cooling such alloys slowly in air has most of the desired effects of quenching; high-speed steel weakens much less from heat cycling due to high-speed cutting. Extremely rapid cooling can prevent the formation of all crystal structure, resulting in amorphous metal or \\"metallic glass\\". Quench hardening Quench hardening is a mechanical process in which steel and cast iron alloys are strengthened and hardened. These metals consist of ferrous metals and alloys. This is done by heating the material to a certain temperature, depending on the material. This produces a harder material by either surface hardening or through-hardening varying on the rate at which the material is cooled. The material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that may increase from the quench hardening process. Items that may be quenched include gears, shafts, and wear blocks. = Purpose = Before hardening, cast steels and iron are of a uniform and lamellar (or layered) pearlitic grain structure. This is a mixture of ferrite and cementite formed when steel or cast iron are manufactured and cooled at a slow rate. Pearlite is not an ideal material for many common applications of steel alloys as it is quite soft. By heating pearlite past its eutectoid transition temperature of 727 ¬∞C and then rapidly cooling, some of the material‚Äôs crystal structure can be transformed into a much harder structure known as martensite. Steels with this martensitic structure are often used in applications when the workpiece must be highly resistant to deformation, such as the cutting edge of blades. This is very efficient. =Process= The process of quenching is a progression, beginning with heating the sample. Most materials are heated to between 815 and 900 ¬∞C (1,500 to 1,650 ¬∞F), with careful attention paid to keeping temperatures throughout the workpiece uniform. Minimizing uneven heating and overheating is key to imparting desired material properties. The second step in the quenching process is soaking. Workpieces can be soaked in air (air furnace), a liquid bath, or a vacuum. The recommended time allocation in salt or lead baths is up to 6 minutes. Soaking times can range a little higher within a vacuum. As in the heating step, it is important that the temperature throughout the sample remains as uniform as possible during soaking. Once the workpiece has finished soaking, it moves on to the cooling step. During this step, the part is submerged into some kind of quenching fluid; different quenching fluids can have a significant effect on the final characteristics of a quenched part. Water is one of the most efficient quenching media where maximum hardness is desired, but there is a small chance that it may cause distortion and tiny cracking. When hardness can be sacrificed, mineral oils are often used. These oil-based fluids often oxidize and form a sludge during quenching, which consequently lowers the efficiency of the process. The cooling rate of oil is much less than water. Intermediate rates between water and oil can be obtained with a purpose formulated quenchant, a substance with an inverse solubility which therefore deposits on the object to slow the rate of cooling. Quenching can also be accomplished using inert gases, such as nitrogen and noble gasses. Nitrogen is commonly used at greater than atmospheric pressure ranging up to 20 bar absolute. Helium is also used because its thermal capacity is greater than nitrogen. Alternatively argon can be used; however, its density requires significantly more energy to move, and its thermal capacity is less than the alternatives. To minimize distortion in the workpiece, long cylindrical workpieces are quenched vertically; flat work pieces are quenched on edge; and thick sections should enter the bath first. To prevent steam bubbles the bath is agitated. Often, after quenching, an iron or steel alloy will be excessively hard and brittle due to an overabundance of martensite. In these cases, another heat treatment technique known as tempering is performed on the quenched material in order to increase the toughness of iron-based alloys. Tempering is usually performed after hardening, to reduce some of the excess hardness, and is done by heating the metal to some temperature below the critical point for a certain period of time, then allowing it to cool in still air.  History  There is evidence of the use of quenching processes by blacksmiths stretching back into the middle of the Iron Age, but little detailed information exists related to the development of these techniques and the procedures employed by early smiths. Although early ironworkers must have swiftly noticed that processes of cooling could affect the strength and brittleness of iron, and it can be claimed that heat-treatment of steel was known in the Old World from the late second millennium BC, it is hard to identify deliberate uses of quenching archaeologically. Moreover, it appears that, at least in Europe, 'quenching and tempering separately do not seem to have become common until the 15th century'; it is therefore helpful to distinguish between 'full quenching' of steel, where the quenching is so rapid that only martensite forms, and 'slack quenching', where the quenching is slower or interrupted, which also allows pearlite to form and results in a less brittle product. The earliest examples of quenched steel may come from ancient Mesopotamia, with a relatively secure example of a fourth-century BC quench-hardened chisel from Al Mina in Turkey. Book 9, lines 389-94 of Homer‚Äôs Odyssey is widely cited as an early, possibly the first, written reference to quenching: > as when a man who works as a blacksmith plunges a screaming great axe blade > or adze into cold water, treating it for temper, since this is the way steel > is made strong, even so Cyclops' eye sizzled about the beam of the olive. However, it is not beyond doubt that the passage describes deliberate quench- hardening, rather than simply cooling.P. R. S. Moorey, Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: The Archaeological Evidence (Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 1999), p. 284. Likewise, there is a prospect that the Mahabharata refers to the oil-quenching of iron arrowheads, but the evidence is problematic.R. K. Dube, 'Ferrous Arrowheads and Their Oil Quench Hardening: Some Early Indian Evidence', JOM: The Journal of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society, 60.5 (May 2008), 25-31. Pliny the Elder addressed the topic of quenchants, distinguishing the water of different rivers.John D. Verhoeven, Steel Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist (Materials Park, Ohio: ASM International, 2007), p. 117. Chapters 18-21 of the twelfth-century De diversis artis by Theophilus Presbyter mentions quenching, recommending amongst other things that 'tools are also given a harder tempering in the urine of a small, red-headed boy than in ordinary water'. One of the fuller early discussions of quenching is the first Western printed book on metallurgy, Von Stahel und Eysen, published in 1532, which is characteristic of late-medieval technical treatises. Modern scientific study of quenching began to gain real momentum from the seventeenth century, with a major step being the observation-led discussion by Giambattista della Porta in his 1558 Magia Naturalis.J. Vanpaemel. HISTORY OF THE HARDENING OF STEEL: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. Journal de Physique Colloques, 1982, 43 (C4), pp. C4-847-C4-854.

Mechanism of Heat Removal During Quenching Heat is removed in three particular stages: Stage A: Vapor-blanket Cooling During this stage, due to the Leidenfrost effect the object is fully surrounded by vapor which insulates it from the rest of the liquid. Stage B: Vapor-transport Cooling Once the temperature has dropped enough, the vapor layer will destabilize and the liquid will be able to fully contact the object and heat will be removed much more quickly. Stage C: Liquid Cooling This stage occurs when the temperature of the object is below the boiling point of the liquid.

Each undirected edge represents dependency. In this example there are 3 hidden units and 4 visible units. This is not a restricted Boltzmann machine. A Boltzmann machine (also called stochastic Hopfield network with hidden units or Sherrington‚ÄìKirkpatrick model with external field or stochastic Ising-Lenz- Little model) is a type of stochastic recurrent neural network. It is a Markov random field. It was translated from statistical physics for use in cognitive science. The Boltzmann machine is based on stochastic spin-glass model with an external field, i.e., a Sherrington‚ÄìKirkpatrick model that is a stochastic Ising Model and applied to machine learning. They are theoretically intriguing because of the locality and Hebbian nature of their training algorithm (being trained by Hebb's rule), and because of their parallelism and the resemblance of their dynamics to simple physical processes. Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference, but if the connectivity is properly constrained, the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems. They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics, which is used in their sampling function. That's why they are called \\"energy based models\\" (EBM). They were heavily popularized and promoted by Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski in cognitive sciences communities and in machine learning. Structure A graphical representation of a Boltzmann machine with a few weights labeled. Each undirected edge represents dependency and is weighted with weight w_{ij}. In this example there are 3 hidden units (blue) and 4 visible units (white). This is not a restricted Boltzmann machine. A Boltzmann machine, like a Hopfield network, is a network of units with an \\"energy\\" (Hamiltonian) defined for the overall network. Its units produce binary results. Unlike Hopfield nets, Boltzmann machine units are stochastic. The global energy E in a Boltzmann machine is identical in form to that of Hopfield networks and Ising models: :E = -\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i Where: * w_{ij} is the connection strength between unit j and unit i. * s_i is the state, s_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}, of unit i. * \\\\theta_i is the bias of unit i in the global energy function. (-\\\\theta_i is the activation threshold for the unit.) Often the weights w_{ij} are represented as a symmetric matrix W=[w_{ij}] with zeros along the diagonal.  Unit state probability  The difference in the global energy that results from a single unit i equaling 0 (off) versus 1 (on), written \\\\Delta E_i, assuming a symmetric matrix of weights, is given by: :\\\\Delta E_i = \\\\sum_{j>i} w_{ij} \\\\, s_j + \\\\sum_{j This can be expressed as the difference of energies of two states: :\\\\Delta E_i = E_\\\\text{i=off} - E_\\\\text{i=on} Substituting the energy of each state with its relative probability according to the Boltzmann factor (the property of a Boltzmann distribution that the energy of a state is proportional to the negative log probability of that state) gives: :\\\\Delta E_i = -k_B\\\\,T\\\\ln(p_\\\\text{i=off}) - (-k_B\\\\,T\\\\ln(p_\\\\text{i=on})) where k_B is Boltzmann's constant and is absorbed into the artificial notion of temperature T. We then rearrange terms and consider that the probabilities of the unit being on and off must sum to one: :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_i}{T} = \\\\ln(p_\\\\text{i=on}) - \\\\ln(p_\\\\text{i=off}) :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_i}{T} = \\\\ln(p_\\\\text{i=on}) - \\\\ln(1 - p_\\\\text{i=on}) :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_i}{T} = \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{p_\\\\text{i=on}}{1 - p_\\\\text{i=on}}\\\\right) :-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_i}{T} = \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{1 - p_\\\\text{i=on}}{p_\\\\text{i=on}}\\\\right) :-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_i}{T} = \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{p_\\\\text{i=on}} - 1\\\\right) :\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_i}{T}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{p_\\\\text{i=on}} - 1 Solving for p_\\\\text{i=on}, the probability that the i-th unit is on gives: :p_\\\\text{i=on} = \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\exp(-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_i}{T})} where the scalar T is referred to as the temperature of the system. This relation is the source of the logistic function found in probability expressions in variants of the Boltzmann machine.  Equilibrium state  The network runs by repeatedly choosing a unit and resetting its state. After running for long enough at a certain temperature, the probability of a global state of the network depends only upon that global state's energy, according to a Boltzmann distribution, and not on the initial state from which the process was started. This means that log-probabilities of global states become linear in their energies. This relationship is true when the machine is \\"at thermal equilibrium\\", meaning that the probability distribution of global states has converged. Running the network beginning from a high temperature, its temperature gradually decreases until reaching a thermal equilibrium at a lower temperature. It then may converge to a distribution where the energy level fluctuates around the global minimum. This process is called simulated annealing. To train the network so that the chance it will converge to a global state according to an external distribution over these states, the weights must be set so that the global states with the highest probabilities get the lowest energies. This is done by training. Training The units in the Boltzmann machine are divided into 'visible' units, V, and 'hidden' units, H. The visible units are those that receive information from the 'environment', i.e. the training set is a set of binary vectors over the set V. The distribution over the training set is denoted P^{+}(V). The distribution over global states converges as the Boltzmann machine reaches thermal equilibrium. We denote this distribution, after we marginalize it over the hidden units, as P^{-}(V). Our goal is to approximate the \\"real\\" distribution P^{+}(V) using the P^{-}(V) produced by the machine. The similarity of the two distributions is measured by the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence, G: :G = \\\\sum_{v}{P^{+}(v)\\\\ln\\\\left({\\\\frac{P^{+}(v)}{P^{-}(v)}}\\\\right)} where the sum is over all the possible states of V. G is a function of the weights, since they determine the energy of a state, and the energy determines P^{-}(v), as promised by the Boltzmann distribution. A gradient descent algorithm over G, changes a given weight, w_{ij} by subtracting the partial derivative of G with respect to the weight. Boltzmann machine training involves two alternating phases. One is the \\"positive\\" phase where the visible units' states are clamped to a particular binary state vector sampled from the training set (according to P^{+}). The other is the \\"negative\\" phase where the network is allowed to run freely, i.e. no units have their state determined by external data. The gradient with respect to a given weight, w_{ij}, is given by the equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial{G}}{\\\\partial{w_{ij}}} = -\\\\frac{1}{R}[p_{ij}^{+}-p_{ij}^{-}] where: * p_{ij}^{+} is the probability that units i and j are both on when the machine is at equilibrium on the positive phase. * p_{ij}^{-} is the probability that units i and j are both on when the machine is at equilibrium on the negative phase. * R denotes the learning rate This result follows from the fact that at thermal equilibrium the probability P^{-}(s) of any global state s when the network is free- running is given by the Boltzmann distribution. This learning rule is biologically plausible because the only information needed to change the weights is provided by \\"local\\" information. That is, the connection (synapse, biologically) does not need information about anything other than the two neurons it connects. This is more biologically realistic than the information needed by a connection in many other neural network training algorithms, such as backpropagation. The training of a Boltzmann machine does not use the EM algorithm, which is heavily used in machine learning. By minimizing the KL- divergence, it is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Therefore, the training procedure performs gradient ascent on the log- likelihood of the observed data. This is in contrast to the EM algorithm, where the posterior distribution of the hidden nodes must be calculated before the maximization of the expected value of the complete data likelihood during the M-step. Training the biases is similar, but uses only single node activity: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial{G}}{\\\\partial{\\\\theta_{i}}} = -\\\\frac{1}{R}[p_{i}^{+}-p_{i}^{-}] Problems Theoretically the Boltzmann machine is a rather general computational medium. For instance, if trained on photographs, the machine would theoretically model the distribution of photographs, and could use that model to, for example, complete a partial photograph. Unfortunately, Boltzmann machines experience a serious practical problem, namely that it seems to stop learning correctly when the machine is scaled up to anything larger than a trivial size. This is due to important effects, specifically: * the required time order to collect equilibrium statistics grows exponentially with the machine's size, and with the magnitude of the connection strengths * connection strengths are more plastic when the connected units have activation probabilities intermediate between zero and one, leading to a so-called variance trap. The net effect is that noise causes the connection strengths to follow a random walk until the activities saturate. Types =Restricted Boltzmann machine= Graphical representation of a restricted Boltzmann machine. The four blue units represent hidden units, and the three red units represent visible states. In restricted Boltzmann machines there are only connections (dependencies) between hidden and visible units, and none between units of the same type (no hidden-hidden, nor visible-visible connections). Although learning is impractical in general Boltzmann machines, it can be made quite efficient in a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) which does not allow intralayer connections between hidden units and visible units, i.e. there is no connection between visible to visible and hidden to hidden units. After training one RBM, the activities of its hidden units can be treated as data for training a higher- level RBM. This method of stacking RBMs makes it possible to train many layers of hidden units efficiently and is one of the most common deep learning strategies. As each new layer is added the generative model improves. An extension to the restricted Boltzmann machine allows using real valued data rather than binary data. One example of a practical RBM application is in speech recognition. = Deep Boltzmann machine = A deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) is a type of binary pairwise Markov random field (undirected probabilistic graphical model) with multiple layers of hidden random variables. It is a network of symmetrically coupled stochastic binary units. It comprises a set of visible units \\\\boldsymbol{ u} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^D and layers of hidden units \\\\boldsymbol{h}^{(1)} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{F_1}, \\\\boldsymbol{h}^{(2)} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{F_2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\boldsymbol{h}^{(L)} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{F_L}. No connection links units of the same layer (like RBM). For the , the probability assigned to vector is : p(\\\\boldsymbol{ u}) = \\\\frac{1}{Z}\\\\sum_h e^{\\\\sum_{ij}W_{ij}^{(1)} u_i h_j^{(1)} + \\\\sum_{jl}W_{jl}^{(2)}h_j^{(1)}h_l^{(2)}+\\\\sum_{lm}W_{lm}^{(3)}h_l^{(2)}h_m^{(3)}}, where \\\\boldsymbol{h} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{h}^{(1)}, \\\\boldsymbol{h}^{(2)}, \\\\boldsymbol{h}^{(3)} \\\\\\\\} are the set of hidden units, and \\\\theta = \\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{W}^{(1)}, \\\\boldsymbol{W}^{(2)}, \\\\boldsymbol{W}^{(3)} \\\\\\\\} are the model parameters, representing visible-hidden and hidden-hidden interactions. In a DBN only the top two layers form a restricted Boltzmann machine (which is an undirected graphical model), while lower layers form a directed generative model. In a DBM all layers are symmetric and undirected. Like DBNs, DBMs can learn complex and abstract internal representations of the input in tasks such as object or speech recognition, using limited, labeled data to fine-tune the representations built using a large set of unlabeled sensory input data. However, unlike DBNs and deep convolutional neural networks, they pursue the inference and training procedure in both directions, bottom-up and top-down, which allow the DBM to better unveil the representations of the input structures. However, the slow speed of DBMs limits their performance and functionality. Because exact maximum likelihood learning is intractable for DBMs, only approximate maximum likelihood learning is possible. Another option is to use mean-field inference to estimate data- dependent expectations and approximate the expected sufficient statistics by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This approximate inference, which must be done for each test input, is about 25 to 50 times slower than a single bottom-up pass in DBMs. This makes joint optimization impractical for large data sets, and restricts the use of DBMs for tasks such as feature representation. = Spike-and-slab RBMs = The need for deep learning with real-valued inputs, as in Gaussian RBMs, led to the spike-and-slab RBM (ssRBM), which models continuous-valued inputs with binary latent variables. Similar to basic RBMs and its variants, a spike-and-slab RBM is a bipartite graph, while like GRBMs, the visible units (input) are real-valued. The difference is in the hidden layer, where each hidden unit has a binary spike variable and a real-valued slab variable. A spike is a discrete probability mass at zero, while a slab is a density over continuous domain; their mixture forms a prior. An extension of ssRBM called ¬µ-ssRBM provides extra modeling capacity using additional terms in the energy function. One of these terms enables the model to form a conditional distribution of the spike variables by marginalizing out the slab variables given an observation.  History  The Boltzmann machine is based on a spin-glass model of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick's stochastic Ising Model. The original contribution in applying such energy based models in cognitive science appeared in papers by Hinton and Sejnowski. The seminal publication by John Hopfield connected physics and statistical mechanics, mentioning spin glasses. The idea of applying the Ising model with annealed Gibbs sampling is present in Douglas Hofstadter's Copycat project. Similar ideas (with a change of sign in the energy function) are found in Paul Smolensky's \\"Harmony Theory\\". The explicit analogy drawn with statistical mechanics in the Boltzmann Machine formulation led to the use of terminology borrowed from physics (e.g., \\"energy\\" rather than \\"harmony\\"), which became standard in the field. The widespread adoption of this terminology may have been encouraged by the fact that its use led to the adoption of a variety of concepts and methods from statistical mechanics. The various proposals to use simulated annealing for inference were apparently independent. Ising models became considered to be a special case of Markov random fields, which find widespread application in linguistics, robotics, computer vision and artificial intelligence.

An O(1) scheduler (pronounced \\"O of 1 scheduler\\", \\"Big O of 1 scheduler\\", or \\"constant time scheduler\\") is a kernel scheduling design that can schedule processes within a constant amount of time, regardless of how many processes are running on the operating system. This is an improvement over previously used O(n) schedulers, which schedule processes in an amount of time that scales linearly based on the amounts of inputs. In the realm of real-time operating systems, deterministic execution is key, and an O(1) scheduler is able to provide scheduling services with a fixed upper-bound on execution times. The O(1) scheduler was used in Linux releases 2.6.0 thru 2.6.22 (2003-2007), at which point it was superseded by the Completely Fair Scheduler.  Overview  The Linux scheduler was overhauled completely with the release of kernel 2.6 in 2003. The new scheduler was called the O(1) scheduler. The algorithm used by the O(1) scheduler relies on active and expired arrays of processes to achieve constant scheduling time. Each process is given a fixed time quantum, after which it is preempted and moved to the expired array. Once all the tasks from the active array have exhausted their time quantum and have been moved to the expired array, an array switch takes place. Because the arrays are accessed only via pointer, switching them is as fast as swapping two pointers. This switch makes the active array the new empty expired array, while the expired array becomes the active array.  About O(1) Notation  An algorithm operates over an input, and the size of that input usually determines its running time. Big O notation is used to denote the growth rate of an algorithm's execution time based on the amount of input. For example, the running time of an O(n) algorithm increases linearly as the input size n grows. The running time of an O(nÀÜ2) algorithm grows quadratically. If it is possible to establish a constant upper bound on the running time of an algorithm, it is considered to be O(1) (one might say it runs in \\"constant time\\"). That is, an O(1) algorithm is guaranteed to complete in a certain amount of time regardless of the size of the input.  Improvement in Linux Scheduler Performance  The Linux 2.6.8.1 scheduler did not contain any algorithms that run in worse than O(1) time. That is, every part of the scheduler is guaranteed to execute within a certain constant amount of time regardless of how many tasks are on the system. This allows the Linux kernel to efficiently handle massive numbers of tasks without increasing overhead costs as the number of tasks grows. There are two key data structures in the Linux 2.6.8.1 scheduler that allow for it to perform its duties in O(1) time, and its design revolves around them - runqueues and priority arrays.  Issues  The main issue with this algorithm is the complex heuristics used to mark a task as interactive or non- interactive. The algorithm tries to identify interactive processes by analyzing average sleep time (the amount of time the process spends waiting for input). Processes that sleep for long periods of time probably are waiting for user input, so the scheduler assumes they're interactive. The scheduler gives a priority bonus to interactive tasks (for better throughput) while penalizing non-interactive tasks by lowering their priorities. All the calculations to determine the interactivity of tasks are complex and subject to potential miscalculations, causing non-interactive behavior from an interactive process.  Replacement  In 2.6.23 (October 2007), the Completely Fair Scheduler was introduced, replacing the O(1) Scheduler. According to Ingo Molnar, the author of the CFS, its core design can be summed up in single sentence: \\"CFS basically models an 'ideal, precise multitasking CPU' on real hardware.\\" See also *Time complexity *Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS) ‚Äì a process scheduler designed for the Linux kernel in August 2009 as an alternative to CFS and the O(1) scheduler References  External links  * Understanding the Linux 2.6.8.1 CPU Scheduler; Josh Aas, 17 February 2005 * HybridThreads (Hthreads); A HW/SW co-designed POSIX-compatible OS featuring an O(1) scheduler implemented in hardware * Inside the Linux scheduler; Written by M.

Little Tramp is a musical with a book by David Pomeranz and Steven David Horwich and music and lyrics by David Pomeranz. Based on the life of comedian Charles Chaplin and named after his most famous character, it opens at the 1971 Academy Awards ceremony at which the aging star, long exiled from the United States, is about to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. The trajectory of the impressive professional career and turbulent private life that leads to this moment is traced via flashbacks in which Chaplin recalls his introduction to Hollywood and silent movies, his failed marriages and problems with the press, his dealings with the FBI, and the creation of his most beloved character, the iconic Little Tramp. In 1992, in order to create interest in a staged production, Pomeranz gathered together what he referred to as his \\"dream cast\\" and recorded a CD of the score. Artists participating in the project included Petula Clark, Lea Salonga, Tim Curry, Mel Brooks, Treat Williams, and Peter Duncan as Chaplin. It was released on the Warner Music UK Ltd. label. Little Tramp received its first staging in 1995 at the prestigious Eugene O'Neill Theater Festival in Waterford, Connecticut (Eugene O'Neill having been the father of Chaplin's wife, Oona O'Neill). The following year, a concert version was presented in St. Petersburg, Russia to inaugurate the world's first East/West Musical Theater Conference. The show was first performed in the UK by Imagine Productions in Preston, and was endorsed by Richard Attenborough, director of the biopic Chaplin. Synopsis At the 1971 Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, an 82-year-old Charlie Chaplin is about to receive a special Life Achievement award. 20 years earlier, Charlie had been barred from re-entry into the United States on the grounds that he was a Communist (\\"In America Again\\"). Charlie looks back at his life. His mother, a failed music hall performer, trying to make ends meet to support little Charlie and his older brother Sydney, reminds her sons that they have something more than mere material possessions (\\"Something No One Can Ever Take Away\\"). Not able to support her children, Hanna Chaplin is taken to the workhouse. The boys try selling their old clothing on the streets but there are no takers. Hungry and heartbroken, Sydney tries to cheer things up (\\"When the World Stops Turning\\") while the Charlie of 1971 rejoins them. When Sydney joined the Navy, Charlie is left to fend for himself. Determined to help his mother, Charlie joined a dance troupe called \\"The Eight Lancashire Lads\\", but his mother's condition worsens and she is placed in an insane asylum. Dodging truant officers, Charlie sees a sign, \\"Blackmore's Theatrical Agency\\" and barges into the agent's office (\\"Number One\\"). Now grown up and a consummate English Stage comedian, Charlie is discovered by filmmaker Mack Sennett and signed to a contract at Keystone Studios in California. Sennett's style of \\"pie in the face\\" comedy is different from Chaplin's slower, more deliberate style, and when Charlie tries to assert his ideas, Sennett gives him some strong advice (\\"Less It Ends With a Chase\\"). Charlie is relentless. Sennett finally throws up his hands in frustration and gives Charlie a chance (\\"The Tramp\\"/\\"He's Got to be Someone\\"). Charlie becomes an overnight sensation. Film distributors, fans and theater owners can't get enough of him (\\"Chaplin Films\\"). Charlie opens his own picture studio and he becomes one of the most beloved public figures. One evening, he is visited by a local chapter of Chaplin Fan Club (\\"Thank You\\"). By this time, Sydney returns as Charlie's personal manager. Getting ready for a swank Hollywood party, Sydney reminisces how far they've come (\\"Heaven\\"). Back to 1971, Charlie's wife, Oona is instructed by the show's assistant director on how Charlie should play to the camera. Furthermore, a government official then warns her that Charlie should avoid making any political comments. Oona is incensed (\\"He's Got to be Someone (Reprise)\\"). The story returns to the 1920s. Charlie's career and personal life are at a low point. His mother just died, and he just underwent two bitter divorces. He is overworked, reporters are on to him and to make things worse, talking pictures are threatening his artistic survival (\\"Too Many Words\\"). Nonetheless his success continued, and Charlie revisits England to attend a Royal Premiere of City Lights. He wanders through his old neighborhood and is stunned that injustice and poverty still exists. In an effort to improve such degenerate conditions, he decides to speak out on behalf of the Russian War Relief. He contends that it's no concern whether or not these people are Communist, they're being slaughtered by the Nazis. After one of his speeches, FBI agent Tippy Gray takes notes and reports his finding to Bureau Chief J. Edgar Hoover (\\"I Got Me a Red\\"/\\"There's Got to be a Law\\"). A paternity suit is filed against Chaplin, giving Hoover ammunition he needed. Although a blood test disproves the allegation, the press crucifies him. His fans turn on him and his films are boycotted. Charlie is dejected. He is convinced that it is just a matter of time before his new wife Oona leaves him too. However. Oona assures him that she won't (\\"This is What I Dreamed\\"). The Chaplins decided to cruise Europe, but aboard the ship, Charlie receives a cable from Washington stating that in order to re-enter the U.S., he must answer to political and moral charges. Crestfallen, Charlie decided to spend the next 20 years living in Veney, Switzerland. Back to 1971, Charlie is escorted to the stage while deeply regarding what he will tell his audience (\\"Finale\\").

A leaders' debate or presidential debate is a public debate held during a general election campaign, where the candidates expose their political opinions and public policy proposals, and criticism of them, to potential voters. They are normally broadcast live on radio, television and Internet. The events may be organized by media corporations or non-government organizations. Leaders' debates are often popular with voters, whose decisions might be greatly influenced by the outcome. Leaders have occasionally attempted to use props (such as charts or signs bearing slogans) during a debate with varying degrees of success. History The success of early televised debates such as the 1960 American presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, viewed by 70 million people,Lapsansky- Werner, Emma J. United States History: Modern America. Boston, MA: Pearson Learning Solutions, 2011. Print. Page 505 would eventually spur the desire to hold similar, televised debates in countries under the parliamentary system. Television had quickly proven to be an excellent and efficient means of reaching out to large blocs of the electorate. The unique aspect of the parliamentary system which creates the desire to hold leaders' debates is that the party leader is usually the party's presumed candidate to lead the government, because by constitutional convention he or she will usually become prime minister or premier if his or her party wins the most seats. However, a leaders' debate is not technically a candidates debate in the same sense that an American presidential debate would be, because in the latter case the American political parties have explicitly nominated the named individuals as their candidates for president and vice president. Format The exact format for a leaders' debate varies, but normally the debate will begin with each leader making a short opening statement. Then a panel of well-known journalists will ask sets of prepared questions, which are to be answered either by all of the leaders or by one specific leader. After the leader(s) answer each question, the other leader(s) may get a chance to make a brief response, after which there may be some time allocated for an often heated \\"free for all\\" debate. The moderator will usually attempt to exercise some control through all of this, and then stop the debate after time has elapsed so the next question can be asked. After the panelists finish asking questions, each leader will make his or her closing remarks and the debate will end. Who gets invited to participate in a leaders' debate is often a sensitive issue. Some jurisdictions may have dozens of fringe political parties which few networks would care to have participating in their debates. For the sake of brevity, and to ensure the leaders of the main parties have adequate time to address voters on a wide range of issues, it is extremely rare for any leaders' debate to have more than five leaders. A more common number would be three while Australia has two. Leaders' debates are often restricted to parties which elected representatives in the previous election. Exceptions may be made for parties with close to a full slate of candidates, but this is not always the case. For example, in Canada in the 2004 and 2006 the Green Party of Canada was excluded from the federal leaders' debates until 2008 when public pressure on the other parties allowed the Green Party to join the debate, and the Alberta Alliance was excluded from the Albertan provincial leaders debate, even though both parties had full slates in their respective elections. Parties that are excluded will often complain bitterly about their exclusion, sometimes claiming that the political establishment has conspired in an effort to keep their party on the political fringe. The inclusion of certain parties in debates can be controversial too. A common complaint about the Canadian debates is voiced by a report from the Centre for the Study of Democracy, which calls for the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, a party only active in mostly French-speaking Quebec, to be removed from its current position in the English-language debates. In Georgia, debates were often so heated that the debaters would be placed in separate rooms. The 2019 Ukrainian presidential election innovated a new approach to the concept of a leaders' debate, where now-president, then-candidate Volodymyr Zelensky proposed to hold debates publicly in the country's largest stadium, the Kiev Olympic Stadium. After much negotiation, the debates were held 48 hours before the election between then-president Peter Poroshenko and Zelensky, in front of nearly 30,000 spectators.https://fakty.com.ua/ru/ukraine/20190419-skilky-lyudej-pryjshlo-na- debaty-poroshenko-zelenskyj-na-stadioni/ Participating countries The following countries hold leaders' debates:\\"All eyes on the leaders' debates\\".

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2018 who represented the riding of Brant. He was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 2011. He is the longest serving Speaker in Ontario history.https://twitter.com/spaikin/status/970828342898413568 Background Born in Brantford, Ontario, Levac was educated at Wilfrid Laurier University, Queen's University and Niagara University. He became a teacher in the early 1980s, and a principal in Brantford in 1989. Levac received the Canada 125 Medal in 1993, was named OECTA Distinguished Teacher in 1994 for his work in conflict resolution programs, and was named Brantford's Citizen of the Year in 1997 by readers of the Brantford Expositor. He also served as co-ordinator of Queen Elizabeth II's Royal Visit to Brantford in 1997. He was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002. In 2011 he was awarded the Chevalier of the Order of Merit for his educational efforts with respect to the Ukrainian famine in the 1930s. Politics Levac was elected in the 1999 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Alayne Sokoloski by 956 votes in the riding of Brant. The Conservatives won a majority government in this election, and Levac sat as an opposition member for the next four years. The Liberals won a majority government in the 2003 provincial election and Levac again defeated Sokoloski, this time by over 10,000 votes. Levac was named chief government Whip. Levac was re-elected in 2007, 2011, and 2014. On April 9, 2009 Levac, along with co-sponsors Cheri DiNovo and Frank Klees passed bill 147 ‚Äì The Holodomor Memorial Day Act. This was the first piece of legislation in the Province‚Äôs history to be introduced with Tri-Partisan sponsorship. This historic legislation recognizes Ukrainian man-made famine as an act of Genocide. On January 25, 2010, Levac was named Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. After the 2011 election, Levac was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He beat three other Liberal members, David Zimmer, Kevin Flynn, and Donna Cansfield. Cansfield was an early favourite for the position but lost to Levac on a second ballot after all the NDP members voted in a bloc for Levac. No New Democrats or Conservatives put their names forward due to the delicate minority status of the Liberal government. He was re-elected as Speaker after the 2014 election defeating four other contenders. On May 5, 2017, Levac announced he would not run for his seat again in the 2018 Ontario general election after 19 years in the Legislature and seven of those years as Speaker.https://twitter.com/?lang=en‚ü®=en Electoral record References External links * Category:1954 births Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Heads of schools in Canada Category:Chevaliers of the Order of Merit (Ukraine) Category:Living people Category:M√©tis politicians Category:Niagara University alumni Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:People from Brantford Category:Speakers of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario ","title":"Dave Levac"},{"id":"1166090","text":"USS Camden (AS-6) was the first ship of the United States Navy to bear the name Camden, after Camden, New Jersey the city that lies on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Initially a German cargo ship known as Kiel, the vessel was seized during World War I and entered into service with the US Navy in 1917 after having her name changed to Camden. She later saw service as a submarine tender and a barracks ship before her sale in 1946. United States service history =Cargo ship, 1917-1918= Camden undergoing conversion into a cargo ship at Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina, on 11 June 1917. The patrol vessel is in the foreground. The ship was built in 1900 by Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft, Flensburg, Germany, as SS Kiel. The vessel was seized by the United States after its entry into World War I in April 1917; transferred from the Shipping Board on 22 May 1917; fitted out as a cargo ship and commissioned on 15 August 1917 as USS Camden with the identification number ID-3143, Lieutenant Commander E. C. Jones, USNRF, in command. Clearing New York in September 1917, Camden carried coal between Cardiff, Wales, and French ports, with one voyage to the United States, until 25 April 1918, when she again sailed for the U.S. She was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 3 May for conversion into a submarine tender. =Submarine tender, 1919-1931= Camden began her many years of service with submarines on 21 February 1919, when she was re- commissioned as a submarine tender with the identification number AS-6. Based out of New London, Connecticut, she was flagship for Commander, Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, and Commander, Submarine Division 9 (SubDiv 9) until 15 September 1920. After repairs at Norfolk, Virginia, she followed her division to the Pacific, where she took up tender duties based on San Pedro, California on 24 June 1921. She briefly served as flagship of Commander, Submarine Flotilla, Pacific Fleet early in 1922, and in March 1923 returned to the Atlantic for duty. As flagship of SubDiv 4 at New London, and later as flagship of Commander, Control Force, she led in large-scale maneuvers and exercises. Highlights of this period included her participation in determined efforts to raise the submarine in September‚ÄìOctober 1925, and her presence at the presidential Naval Review in Hampton Roads in May 1927. Camden was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 26 May 1931. =Barracks ship, 1940-1946= War called the veteran back from retirement, and on 17 September 1940 Camden was reclassified IX-42, and assigned to New York Navy Yard as a barracks ship. Towed by tug USS Allegheny (AT-19), the floating barracks arrived at Pier 92, New York City on 18 September, and performed her humble but essential role of berthing the war-swollen complement of the yard until 23 October 1946, when she was sold.

It takes its name from the founder of the firm, Hyman Hetchin. History Hyman Hetchin was a Russian Jew who fled the Bolshevik revolution around 1917 and settled in Britain. By 1922, Hetchin had opened a shop in Seven Sisters Road, Tottenham, North London, selling household appliances including gramophones, sheet music, shellac 78 rpm records, and, later, bicycles.Hilary Stone has researched this in Kelly's Street Directories 1914 - 1934.John Liffen has verified this in the rates books and electoral register. At first Hetchin resold mass-produced bicycles, including Raleigh and Rudge. Jack Denny was a London frame builder who had a shop at 194 Wandsworth Road, not far from Seven Sisters Road. Denny had experimented with an innovative design involving curved stays; Hetchin recognized the marketing potential of the design, partnered with Denny, and patented the design in 1934. From then on, Hetchin stopped re-selling other bicycle marques, and produced and sold only his own. The partnership soon brought rewards in the form of Olympic and World's Championship victories in 1936. Sales were strong thereafter, reaching a pre-war peak of over 600 frames in 1938 and 500 in 1939. The war years saw production fall to below 200 frames per year; sales did not recover until 1953. These are remarkable figures for a shop which consisted of one man who took care of sales and marketing (Hyman Hetchin) and one frame builder (Jack Denny). In the 1950s, additional help was recruited, consisting of part-time lug cutters (including Ken Janes) and frame builders (chiefly Bob Stratfull and Stan Broom). The partnership endured past Hyman's death in 1961, when Hyman's son Alfred ('Alf') took over the business. Apart from the patented curly (or \\"vibrant\\") stays, Hetchin's frames were (and still are) known for ornate, and often hand-cut, lugwork. Other design innovations are attributed to Hetchin/Denny, such as a fluted seat tube on six-day racers (this brings the rear wheel closer to the seat tube than on conventional bicycle frames, shortening the wheelbase). Hetchin supported many racers and racing teams, especially track and six-day contestants, over the years. In 1974, the shop moved to Southend-On-Sea (forced, due to re-zoning of the Tottenham property). Alf continued to manage the business until his retirement in 1986, when he sold the shop to a London businessman. For a short time, Hetchins and Bob Jackson Cycles (Leeds) were fused, but the two marques separated in 1993. Since 1993, the Hetchins operation has been centered in Preston (UK) under the management of David Miller; the current frame builder is Paul Riley. Jack Denny was born in 1906 and died in 1991. Alf Hetchin was born 24 Sept. 1923 and died at the age of 72, a few years after Jack Denny. Hetchins Lightweights continues to produce bespoke lugged-steel bicycle frames. Approximately 12,000 frames have been produced to date (2015), counting from 1934, of which some 16% are known to have survived. The frames are highly sought by collectors.

All the King's Men had previously been adapted into a Best Picture Oscar‚Äìwinning film by writer-director Robert Rossen in 1949. The film narrates the rise to power & dramatic demise of the ruthless Governor Willie Stark (played by Sean Penn), taking his office in the American South. The fictional character is loosely based on the life of Louisiana governor Huey Long, in office between 1928 through 1932. Elected as a U.S. Senator, he was assassinated in 1935. The film co-stars Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley. Plot Jack Burden, a Louisiana news reporter, takes a personal interest in Willie Stark, an idealistic small-town lawyer and parish treasurer. Circumstances develop that result in Tiny Duffy, a local political leader Burden knows, urging Stark to run for governor. Burden's upbringing makes him familiar with the undercurrent of politics ‚Äì he was raised by his loving godfather Judge Irwin, a former state attorney general, while his good friend, Dr. Adam Stanton, and his sister Anne Stanton‚Äîalso Burden's former lover‚Äîare the children of a former governor. Burden therefore decides to take Duffy's advice and travels as a reporter on Stark's campaign for governor. The politically astute Burden soon deduces, and Duffy strategist (and Stark mistress) Sadie Burke confirms, that Duffy is using Stark to split his party's vote and thus allow the opposing party to win. They tell Stark, who begins to give speeches in a straightforward manner to appeal to the public, in defiance of the advice given to him by Duffy. His vigorous strategy attacks the corruption of the existing players and promises schools and roads for his ‚Äúfellow ignorant hicks‚Äù, resulting in Stark winning the election. He manages Duffy by making him his lieutenant governor. Stark recruits Burden to work for him as an adviser. Stark proves to be a very persuasive governor, delivering on many of his new projects. Irwin disapproves of Stark and publicly supports an investigation of possible graft in the new spending. Burden points out that graft is the elite's word for what the previous politicians had always done, while Stark openly tells his crowds that his ‚Äúcrooks, unlike theirs, are itty bitty‚Äù compared to the elite's. Stark convinces Stanton to head a new public hospital while he begins having an affair with Anne, provoking Burke's jealousy and Burden's disappointment. Irwin continues criticizing Stark as political controversies begin to unfold. Stark demands that Burden seek information on the judge to be used against him. Jack insists that there is no such information, but eventually discovers evidence of a bribe that Irwin used to get his appointment many years prior, leading an opponent to commit suicide. Following this revelation, Irwin himself commits suicide. Burden's mother then tells him that Irwin treated him with such love because he was his biological father, which causes a great amount of guilt for Burden. Stark utilizes many methods of corruption to consolidate his power, including patronage and intimidation. Adam is told that Stark is using the hospital project to rob the state and is framing him in the process. Burden and Anne both assure Adam that this is false. Adam also becomes enraged when he learns of Stark's affair with his sister. Adam waits at the state capitol and assassinates Stark, only to be immediately killed by the governor's bodyguard. It is later revealed that Adam was influenced by Duffy and Burke to murder Stark, allowing Duffy to succeed Stark as governor.

The book and the original film are set during the Great Depression, the period of Huey Long's ascendancy. * Jack's doctoral research storyline is not in the film. His research was about Cass Mastern, an ancestor who lived in the Antebellum South and fought in the American Civil War. The book devotes an extensive passage to the story of Mastern and the way in which he unwittingly and drastically influences the lives of others, which many critics have argued serves as the novel's moral center. Jack walks away from his study of Mastern because he is unwilling to accept the way in which people's actions influence the fates of others. * The storyline of the book involving Tom Stark is removed. He is seen only a few times in the film. In the book Tom impregnates a girl, which threatens his father with a scandal. * The film ends a few minutes after Willie Stark's assassination, explaining little (through newspaper headlines) about what takes place after the event. In the book, Jack Burden explains many things that take place after the assassination, which includes son Tom's death. Production Filming took place in New Orleans, Morgan City, Donaldsonville, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge and many other places in Louisiana.

A special screening was held at the Tulane University in New Orleans on September 16, 2006. Reception =Box office = All the King's Men grossed $7.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $9.5 million, against a production budget of $50 million. In the film's opening weekend it made $3.7 million from 1,514 theaters, finishing seventh. It then dropped to 11th place with a gross of $1.5 million in its second weekend, and by its third weekend fell to 27th place with $285,993. = Critical response = James Carville, executive producer, at the film's premiere. In spite of its high-profile cast, direction and production team, the film was a massive failure, both with critics and at the box office.PEOPLE.com On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds approval rating of 11% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 4.21/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"With a scenery-chewing performance from Sean Penn, an absence of political insight, and an overall lack of narrative cohesiveness, these Men give Oscar bait a bad name.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed disappointment with the film: \\"Nothing in the picture works. It is both overwrought and tedious, its complicated narrative bogging down in lyrical voiceover, long flashbacks and endless expository conversations between people speaking radically incompatible accents.\\" Michael Medved gave All the King's Men two stars (out of four) calling it \\"depressing and disappointing\\", a \\"stodgy melodrama\\" and a \\"pointless, pretentious, plodding period-piece\\". Some reviews were positive. Richard Schickel of Time Magazine liked the movie, arguing that \\"it's much more faithful to the tone of the novel\\" than the original. Kenneth Turan (Los Angeles Times) praised the film's \\"undeniable moral seriousness\\" and the actors' \\"exceptional ensemble work.\\" He argued that Zaillian's script and direction \\"expertly extracted the core of this greatest of American political novels, a work that is both of its time and outside it.\\" Aftermath The film was featured in Nathan Rabin's ongoing feature for The Onion's A.V. Club, \\"My Year of Flops\\". Of three categories (failure, fiasco, or secret success), he labeled All the King's Men as a failure and said of the film: \\"Zaillian‚Äôs dud manages the formidable feat of being at once histrionic and agonizingly dull, hysterically over-the-top yet strangely lifeless.\\" Zaillian was stunned by the poor critical and box- office results of this film, which opened with only $3.8 million and barely made $7.2 million at the end of its run in US theaters. Another new wide release from the same weekend, Jackass Number Two, made $28.1 million. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Zaillian said that the film's poor performance was \\"like getting hit by a truck. ... I don't know what to make of it.... We're all a bit shellshocked. I feel like Huey Long must have felt -- you try to do good and they shoot you for it.\\" Soundtrack The film's score was composed by James Horner, who had previously worked with Zallian on Searching For Bobby Fischer. * \\"Main Title\\" ‚Äì 4:30 * \\"Time Brings All Things to Light\\" ‚Äì 1:45 * \\"Give Me the Hammer and I'll NAIL 'EM UP!\\" ‚Äì 5:59 * \\"Bring Down the Lion and the Rest of the Jungle Will Quake in Fear\\" ‚Äì 3:34 * \\"Conjuring the 'Hick' Vote\\" ‚Äì 3:14 * \\"Anne's Memories\\" ‚Äì 2:47 * \\"Adam's World\\" ‚Äì 3:43 * \\"Jack's Childhood\\" ‚Äì 2:22 * \\"The Rise to Power\\" ‚Äì 3:17 * \\"Love's Betrayal\\" ‚Äì 2:54 * \\"Only Faded Pictures\\" ‚Äì 2:49 * \\"As We Were Children Once\\" ‚Äì 2:49 * \\"Verdict and Punishment\\" ‚Äì 6:00 * \\"All Our Lives Collide\\" ‚Äì 3:23 * \\"Time Brings All Things to Light...

Suspected of collusion with the enemy for suggesting the compromise, Lycidas was stoned to death by \\"those in the council and those outside, [who] were so enraged.... [W]ith all the uproar in Salamis over Lycidas, the Athenian women soon found out what had happened; whereupon, without a word from the men, they got together, and, each one urging on her neighbor and taking her along with the crowd, flocked to Lycidas' house and stoned his wife and children.\\" The name later occurs in Theocritus's Idylls, where Lycidas is most prominently a poet-goatherd encountered on the trip of \\"Idyll vii.\\" The name appears several times in Virgil and is a typically Doric shepherd's name, appropriate for the pastoral mode. A Lycidas appears in Ovid's Metamorphoses as a centaur. Lycidas also occurs in Lucan's Pharsalia, where in iii.636 a sailor named Lycidas is ripped by an iron hook from the deck of a ship. \\"Lycidas\\" as pastoral elegy By naming Edward King \\"Lycidas,\\" Milton follows \\"the tradition of memorializing a loved one through Pastoral poetry, a practice that may be traced from ancient Greek Sicily through Roman culture and into the Christian Middle Ages and early Renaissance.\\" Milton describes King as \\"selfless,\\" even though he was of the clergy ‚Äì a statement both bold and, at the time, controversial among lay people: \\"Through allegory, the speaker accuses God of unjustly punishing the young, selfless King, whose premature death ended a career that would have unfolded in stark contrast to the majority of the ministers and bishops of the Church of England, whom the speaker condemns as depraved, materialistic, and selfish.\\" Authors and poets in the Renaissance used the pastoral mode in order to represent an ideal of life in a simple, rural landscape. Literary critics have emphasized the artificial character of pastoral nature: \\"The pastoral was in its very origin a sort of toy, literature of make-believe.\\" Milton himself \\"recognized the pastoral as one of the natural modes of literary expression,\\" employing it throughout \\"Lycidas\\" in order to achieve a strange juxtaposition between death and the remembrance of a loved one.\\"Milton, John\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 3 Nov. 2008 The poem itself begins with a pastoral image of laurels and myrtles, ‚Äúsymbols of poetic fame; as their berries are not yet ripe, the poet is not yet ready to take up his pen.‚ÄùHale, James. \\"Lycidas.\\" Masterplots II: Poetry 2002: MagillonLiterature Plus. EBSCOhost. 3 Nov2008 However, the speaker is so filled with sorrow for the death of Lycidas that he finally begins to write an elegy. \\"Yet the untimely death of young Lycidas requires equally untimely verses from the poet. Invoking the muses of poetic inspiration, the shepherd-poet takes up the task, partly, he says, in hope that his own death will not go unlamented.\\" The speaker continues by recalling the life of the young shepherds together \\"in the ‚Äòpastures‚Äô of Cambridge.\\" Milton uses the pastoral idiom to allegorize experiences he and King shared as fellow students at Christ‚Äôs College, Cambridge. The university is represented as the ‚Äúself-same hill‚Äù upon which the speaker and Lycidas were ‚Äúnurst‚Äù; their studies are likened to the shepherds‚Äô work of ‚Äúdr[iving] a field‚Äù and ‚ÄúBatt‚Äôning‚Ä¶ flocks‚Äù; classmates are ‚ÄúRough satyrs‚Äù and ‚Äúfauns with clov‚Äôn heel‚Äù and the dramatic and comedic pastimes they pursued are ‚ÄúRural ditties‚Ä¶ / Temper‚Äôed to th‚Äô oaten flute\\"; a Cambridge professor is ‚Äúold Damoetas [who] lov‚Äôd to hear our song.‚Äù The poet then notes the \\"‚Äòheavy change‚Äô suffered by nature now that Lycidas is gone‚Äîa ‚Äòpathetic fallacy‚Äô in which the willows, hazel groves, woods, and caves lament Lycidas's death.\\" In the next section of the poem, \\"The shepherd-poet reflects‚Ä¶ that thoughts of how Lycidas might have been saved are futile‚Ä¶ turning from lamenting Lycidas‚Äôs death to lamenting the futility of all human labor.\\" This section is followed by an interruption in the swain's monologue by the voice of Phoebus, \\"the sun-god, an image drawn out of the mythology of classical Roman poetry, [who] replies that fame is not mortal but eternal, witnessed by Jove (God) himself on judgment day.\\" At the end of the poem, King/Lycidas appears as a resurrected figure, being delivered, through the resurrecting power of Christ, by the waters that lead to his death: \\"Burnished by the sun's rays at dawn, King resplendently ascends heavenward to his eternal reward.\\" Although on its surface \\"Lycidas\\" reads like a straightforward pastoral elegy, a closer reading reveals its complexity. \\"Lycidas\\" has been called \\"‚Äòprobably the most perfect piece of pure literature in existence‚Ä¶‚Äô [employing] patterns of structure, prosody, and imagery to maintain a dynamic coherence. The syntax of the poem is full of ‚Äòimpertinent auxiliary assertions‚Äô that contribute valuably to the experience of the poem.\\" The piece itself is remarkably dynamic, enabling many different styles and patterns to overlap, so that \\"the loose ends of any one pattern disappear into the interweavings of the others.\\" \\"Lycidas\\" also has its detractors, including 18th-century literary critic and polymath Samuel Johnson, who infamously called the pastoral form \\"easy, vulgar, and therefore disgusting,\\" and said of Milton's elegy: > It is not to be considered as the effusion of real passion; for passion runs > not after remote allusions and obscure opinions. Passion plucks no berries > from the myrtle and ivy, nor calls upon Arethuse and Mincius, nor tells of > rough satyrs and fauns with cloven heel. Where there is leisure for fiction > there is little grief. Johnson was reacting to what he saw as the irrelevance of the pastoral idiom in Milton's age and his own, and to its ineffectiveness at conveying genuine emotion. Johnson said that conventional pastoral images‚Äîfor instance, the representation of the speaker and the deceased as shepherds‚Äîwere \\"long ago exhausted,\\" and so improbable that they \\"always forc[e] dissatisfaction on the mind.\\" Johnson also criticized the blending of Christian and pagan images and themes in \\"Lycidas,\\" which he saw as the poem's \\"grosser fault.\\" He said \\"Lycidas\\" positions the ‚Äútrifling fictions‚Äù of ‚Äúheathen deities‚ÄîJove and Phoebus, Neptune and √Üolus‚Äù alongside ‚Äúthe most awful and sacred truths, such as ought never to be polluted with such irreverend combinations. Johnson concluded: \\"Surely no man could have fancied that he read Lycidas with pleasure had he not known its author.\\"  The Uncouth Swain  Though commonly considered to be a monody, ‚ÄòLycidas‚Äô in fact features two distinct voices, the first of which belongs to the uncouth swain (or shepherd). The work opens with the swain, who finds himself grieving for the death of his friend, Lycidas, in an idyllic pastoral world. In his article entitled \\"Belief and Disbelief in Lycidas,\\" Lawrence W. Hyman states that the swain is experiencing a \\"loss of faith in a world order that allows death to strike a young man.\\" Similarly, Lauren Shohet asserts that the swain is projecting his grief upon the classical images of the pastoral setting at this point in the elegy.Shohet, Lauren. \\"Subjects and Objects in Lycidas.\\" Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Volume 47, Number 2, Summer 2005, pp. 101‚Äì119, 103 Throughout the poem, the swain uses both Christian and Pagan concepts, and mentally locates Lycidas‚Äô body in both settings, according to Russel Fraser.Fraser, Russell. \\"Milton‚Äôs Two Poets.\\" Studies in English Literature (Rice); Winter94, Vol. 34 Issue 1, p109, 10p., 115 Examples of this are the mention of Death as an animate being, the \\"Sisters of the Sacred Well,\\" Orpheus, the blind Fury that struck Lycidas down, and the scene in which Lycidas is imagined to have become a regional deity (a \\"genius of the shore\\") after drowning. Since Lycidas, like King, drowned, there is no body to be found, and the absence of the corpse is of great concern to the swain. Ultimately, the swain's grief and loss of faith are conquered by a \\"belief in immortality.\\"Hyman, 532 Many scholars have pointed out that there is very little logical basis within the poem for this conclusion, but that a reasonable process is not necessary for 'Lycidas' to be effective.Hyman, 532‚Äì533 Fraser will argue that Milton's voice intrudes briefly upon the swain's to tell a crowd of fellow swains that Lycidas is not in fact dead (here one sees belief in immortality). This knowledge is inconsistent with the speaker's \\"uncouth\\" character.Fraser, 116  The Pilot  Upon entering the poem at line 109, the voice of the \\"Pilot of the Galilean lake,\\" generally believed to represent St. Peter, serves as a judge, condemning the multitude of unworthy members found among the clergy of the Church of England. Similarly, St. Peter fills the position of Old Testament prophet when he speaks of the clergy's ‚Äúmoral decay‚Äù and the grave consequences of their leadership. He then compares these immoral church leaders to wolves among sheep and warns of the ‚Äútwo-handed engine.‚Äù According to E. S. de Beer, this \\"two-handed engine\\" is thought to be a powerful weapon and an allusion to a portion of the Book of Zechariah. Concerning St. Peter's role as a \\"prophet,\\" the term is meant in the Biblical sense, de Beer claims, and not in the more modern sense of the word. Since Biblical prophets more often served as God's messengers than as seers, de Beer states that Milton was not attempting to foretell the likely future of the church via St. Peter.de Beer, 62 De Beer continues on to note that St. Peter's appearance in \\"Lycidas\\" is likely unrelated to his position as head of the Roman Catholic Church. Neither was St. Peter ascribed any particular position within the Church of England. Instead, de Beer argues that St. Peter appears simply as an apostolic authority, through whom Milton might express his frustration with unworthy members of the English clergy.de Beer, 60 Fraser also agrees that St. Peter, indeed, serves as a vehicle for Milton's voice to enter the poem.Fraser 109 The Church was so thrown off by the poem that they banned it for nearly twenty years after Milton's death. The conclusion Several interpretations of the ending have been proposed.Post, Jonathan. \\"Helpful Contraries: Carew's 'Donne' and Milton's Lycidas.\\" George Hebert Journal Vol. 29.1 and 2 (Fall 2005/Spring 2006): 88‚Äì89. Project Muse 3 November 2008 88 Jonathan Post claims the poem ends with a sort of retrospective picture of the poet having \\"sung\\" the poem into being.Post, Jonathan. \\"Helpful Contraries: Carew's 'Donne' and Milton's Lycidas.\\" George Herbert Journal Vol. 29.1 and 2 (Fall 2005/Spring 2006): 88‚Äì89. Project Muse 3 November 2008 According to critic Lauren Shohet, Lycidas is transcendently leaving the earth, becoming immortal, rising from the pastoral plane in which he is too involved or tangled from the objects that made him. She claims that \\"he is diffused into, and animates, the last location of his corpse‚Äîhis experience of body-as-object‚Ä¶ neither fully immanent (since his body is lost) nor fully transcendent (since he remains on earth).\\"Shohet 113 With an ambiguous ending, the poem does not just end with a death, but instead, it just begins.Kilgour, Maggie. \\"Heroic Contradiction: Samson and the Death of Turnus.\\" Texas Studies in Literature and Language Vol. 50.2 (2008) The monody clearly ends with a death and an absolute end but also moves forward and comes full circle because it takes a look back at the pastoral world left behind making the ambivalence of the end a mixture of creation and destruction.Kilgour 224 Nonetheless \\"thy large recompense\\" also has a double meaning. As Paul Alpers states, Lycidias' gratitude in heaven is a payment for his loss. The word \\"thy\\" is both an object and mediator of \\"large recompense.\\" Thus, the meaning also maintains the literal meaning which is that of a sacred higher being or the pagan genius.Alpers 494 The final lines of the poem: :And now the Sun had stretch'd out all the hills, :And now was dropt into the Western bay; :At last he rose, and twitch'd his Mantle blew: :To morrow to fresh Woods, and Pastures new may refer to Milton's imminent departure to Italy, and they are reminiscent of the end of Virgil's 10th Eclogue, { cellpadding=5  Surgamus; solet esse gravis cantantibus umbra; iuniperi gravis umbra; nocent et frugibus umbrae. Ite domum saturae, venit Hesperus, ite capellae.  Come, let us rise: the shade is wont to be baneful to singers; baneful is the shade cast by the juniper, crops sicken too in shade. Now homeward, having fed your fill ‚Äî eve's star is rising ‚Äî go, my she-goats, go. } Justa Edouardo King Naufrago \\"Lycidas\\" was originally published in a poetic miscellany alongside thirty-five other poems elegizing the death of Edward King. Collected at Cambridge, most of the poems were written by academics at the university who were committed to the conservative church politics of Archbishop Laud. Among the poets were John Cleveland, Joseph Beaumont, and Henry More. Milton, on the other hand, who reported that he had been \\"Church-outed by the prelates,\\"CPW 1:823 had failed to achieve a position at Cambridge after his graduation, and his religious views were becoming more radical. The style and form of his poem also strongly contrasts from the other texts in the collection. While most of the poetry adopts a baroque aesthetic linked to the Laudian ceremonialism that was in vogue in the 1630s, Milton wrote \\"Lycidas\\" in the outmoded pastoral style.Gadaleto, p. 156 \\"Lycidas\\" may actually be satirizing the poetic work featured throughout the Justa Edouardo King Naufrago.Gadaleto, p. 158 1645 reprint Milton republished the poem in his 1645 collection Poems of Mr. John Milton. To this version is added a brief prose preface: : In this MONODY the Author bewails a learned Friend, unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish seas, 1637. And by occasion foretells the ruin of our corrupted clergy, then in their height. When Milton published this version, in 1645, the Long Parliament, to which Milton held allegiance, was in power; thus Milton could add the prophetic note‚Äîin hindsight‚Äîabout the destruction of the \\"corrupted clergy,\\" the \\"blind mouths\\" (119) of the poem. Influence The poem was exceedingly popular. It was hailed as Milton's best poem, and by some as the greatest lyrical poem in the English language.Bloom, H. (2004) The best poems of the English language: From Chaucer through Frost. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. Yet it was detested for its artificiality by Samuel Johnson, who found \\"the diction is harsh, the rhymes uncertain, and the numbers unpleasing\\" and complained that \\"in this poem there is no nature, for there is no truth; there is no art, for there is nothing new.\\" It is from a line in \\"Lycidas\\" that Thomas Wolfe took the name of his novel Look Homeward, Angel: :Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth: :And, O ye Dolphins', waft the hapless youth. (163‚Äì164) The title of Howard Spring's 1940 political novel Fame is the Spur takes its title from the poem, as does The Sheep Look Up by John Brunner which is taken from line 125. The title of the short story \\"Wash Far Away\\" by John Berryman from the collection Freedom of the Poet is also taken from this poem: :Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding Seas :Wash far away, where ere thy bones are hurld, (154‚Äì155) The song \\"The Alphabet Business Concern (Home of Fadeless Splendour)\\", from the album, Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992) by Cardiacs, contains the lines: > Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears And slits the thin spun life. > (75‚Äì76) See also * 1637 in poetry, the year the poem was written * 1638 in poetry, the year the poem was published References Further reading * Patrides, C.

At City Hall he was appointed as Deputy Mayor (1993-2003) and chaired the social services committee after the 2000 municipal election. =Provincial= Leal ran for provincial office in the 1999 provincial election as the Liberal candidate. He was narrowly defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Gary Stewart. He defeated Stewart by over six thousand votes in a 2003 rematch, amid a provincial shift to the Liberal Party. Leal was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and 2014. During his time in government he has served as Parliamentary Assistant to several ministers including Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (2004), Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (2005), Ministry of Energy (2005), Ministry of the Environment (2006), and the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs (2007‚Äì09). In February 2010, he was named the Chief Government Whip. In February 2013, Premier Kathleen Wynne named Leal to Ontario's Cabinet, serving in the role as Minister of Rural Affairs. Leal has helped secure over $400 million in funding for Peterborough, creating and preserving over 3,700 jobs with investments in infrastructure, transportation, businesses and health care. This included the creation of a new hospital, Peterborough Regional Health Centre, and funding following a damaging flood in 2004. Leal has championed a number of issues through private member's bills, including retirement and income security measures. He introduced a private member's bill in 2008 to provide creditor protection for Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs). Two years later, he introduced a separate bill that would require companies with twenty or more employees to offer a savings or pension plan that all employees would automatically join (with the ability to opt out). The stated purpose of this bill, which was supported by the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, was to reduce the costs of such insurance plans compared with retail mutual funds. In June 2014, Leal was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Food and Rural Affairs. =Cabinet positions= =Electoral record= References External links * Category:1954 births Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:Peterborough, Ontario city councillors Category:Trent University alumni Category:University of Windsor alumni ","title":"Jeff Leal"},{"id":"1166131","text":"The Tapti River (or Tapi) is a river in central India between the Godavari and Narmada rivers which flows westwards before draining into the Arabian Sea.

During development, it was known as the Light Experimental Ordnance (LEO), with the G7 label being chosen later to fit in with Denel's two existing howitzer products, the G5 towed 155 mm howitzer and the G6 self-propelled 155 mm howitzer. Potential customers In 2004, DLS partnered with General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to offer the gun in self-propelled form to the United States Army. GDLS provided an armoured vehicle (the LAV III), while Denel provided a G7 mounted inside a specially-designed, unmanned turret. The combined system weighs only 17.5 tons when fully loaded with ammunition, making it light enough to be transportable inside a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. The combination took part in a number of tests for the US Army. Though currently unfunded, the US Army has indicated a requirement for such a system to equip its Stryker Brigade. The Strykers cannot use current self- propelled and towed howitzers as their weight is a limiting factor on the brigade's mobility. Interest in the system has also been exhibited by the militaries of South Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. In addition, the US Army and United States Marine Corps (USMC) have exhibited interest in the towed version as a possible replacement for their towed 105 mm howitzer stocks.

He won the Cam√µes Prize in 2013, the most important literary award in the Portuguese language, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2014. Life =Early years= Couto was born in the city of Beira, Mozambique's third largest city, where he was also raised and schooled. He is the son of Portuguese emigrants who moved to the Portuguese colony in the 1950s. When he was 14, some of his poetry was published in a local newspaper, Not√≠cias da Beira. Three years later, in 1971, he moved to the capital Louren√ßo Marques (now Maputo) and began to study medicine at the University of Louren√ßo Marques. During this time, the anti-colonial guerrilla and political movement FRELIMO was struggling to overthrow the Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique. =After independence of Mozambique= In April 1974, after the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon and the overthrow of the Estado Novo regime, Mozambique was about to become an independent republic. In 1974, FRELIMO asked Couto to suspend his studies for a year to work as a journalist for Tribuna until September 1975 and then as the director of the newly created Mozambique Information Agency (AIM). Later, he ran Tempo magazine until 1981. His first book of poems, Raiz de Orvalho, was published in 1983; it included texts aimed against the dominance of Marxist militant propaganda.Chabal, Patrick. Vozes Mo√ßambicanas. Vega: Lisboa, 1994 (274‚Äì291). Couto continued working for the newspaper Not√≠cias until 1985 when he resigned to finish his course of study in biology. Literary works and recognition Not only is Mia Couto considered one of the most important writers in Mozambique, but his works have been published in more than 20 countries and in various languages, including Portuguese, English, French, German, Czech, Italian, Serbian, Catalan, Estonian and Chinese. In many of his texts, he undertakes to recreate the Portuguese language by infusing it with regional vocabulary and structures from Mozambique, thus producing a new model for the African narrative. Stylistically, his writing is influenced by magical realism, a movement popular in modern Latin American literatures, and his use of language is reminiscent of the Brazilian writer Jo√£o Guimar√£es Rosa, but also deeply influenced by the baiano writer Jorge Amado. He has been noted for creating proverbs, sometimes known as \\"improverbs\\", in his fiction, as well as riddles, legends, metaphors, giving his work a poetic dimension.Coutinho, Maria Jo√£o. 2008. \\"The heart is a beach: proverbs and improverbs in Mia Couto's stories\\". Proceedings of the First Interdisciplinary Colloquium on Proverbs, eds Rui. J. B. Soares and Outi Lauhakangas, 484‚Äì489. An international jury at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair named his first novel, Terra Son√¢mbula (Sleepwalking Land), one of the best 12 African books of the 20th century. In 2007, he became the first African author to win the prestigious Latin Union literary prize, which has been awarded annually in Italy since 1990. Mia Couto became only the fourth writer in the Portuguese language to take home this prestigious award, having competed against authors from Portugal, France, Colombia, Spain, Italy, and Senegal. Currently, he is a biologist employed by the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park while continuing his work on other writing projects. In 1998, Couto was elected into the Brazilian Academy of Letters, the first African writer to receive such an honor.

De Sousa's poetry and involvement in Mo√ßambicanidade was a large part of the anti-colonial literary movement of Mozambique. Life  No√©mia de Sousa was born of mixed-race heritage in Catembe, on the south side of the bay across from the Mozambican capital Maputo. Her father was a descended from a Luso- Afro-Indian family from the island of Mozambique; her maternal grandfather was German. Her father taught her to read at the age of four, four years before he died.The Northeastern Dictionary of Women's Biography.

De Sousa wrote often in her early years but did not publish her work until the age of 22 in 1948. From that year on, she published her work frequently for the next three years. Moving to Portugal by the age of 25, de Sousa lived in Lisbon, working as a translator from 1951 to 1964. She then left for Paris, where she worked for the local consulate of Morocco. She went back to Lisbon in 1975 and became a member of the ANOP. She worked with several newspapers and magazines throughout her life. Some of her most notable collaborations were with Mensagem (CEI); Mensagem (Luanda); Itiner√°rio; Not√≠cias do Bloqueio (Porto, 1959); O Brado Africano; Mo√ßambique 58; V√©rtice (Coimbra), Sul (Brazil).  Writing career  In the early 1950s de Sousa became involved in the Mo√ßambicanidade movement. During this period anti-colonial literature in Mozambique was at its peak and de Sousa was one of many Mozambican women writers active in the resistance. One of de Sousa's initial contributions to the movement was sharing her literary works with news outlets that supported the resistance. De Sousa wrote an impactful poem, \\"Poema para uma Inf√¢ncia Distante,\\" that was published in a resistance news publication. This prominent literary work was one that played an immense role in the spread of cultural identity and awareness in the Mo√ßambicanidade movement. = Mo√ßambicanidade = Mo√ßambicanidade was the name for a new and revolutionary literature that spread throughout Mozambique during the 1940s and 1950s. The literate culture of Mozambique shifted its focus from European styles to Mozambican cultural awareness, anti-colonialism, and political activism. This literary movement was an open platform for the citizens of Mozambique to open dialogue on issues concerning race, class, and politics. Both men and women were involved in this revolutionary literary movement. The three major journals in support of and associated with Mo√ßambicanidade were, O Brado Africano, Itiner√°rio, and Msabo. No√©mia de Sousa was regularly published in O Brado Africano, and from 1949 she organized, directed, and edited the women's columns until she left for Portugal in 1951. During de Sousa's time at O Brado Africano, she focused the conversation on African identity, black pride, and indigenous feminism. She often published her work under the name, Vera Micaia.

W. Stewart wet mop from 1893 A mop in a bucket with its dryer A mop (such as a floor mop) is a mass or bundle of coarse strings or yarn, etc., or a piece of cloth, sponge or other absorbent material, attached to a pole or stick. It is used to soak up liquid, for cleaning floors and other surfaces, to mop up dust, or for other cleaning purposes. The word (then spelled mappe) is attested in English as early as 1496, but new refinements and variations of mop designs have been introduced, from time to time. For example, American inventor Jacob Howe received U.S. patent #241 for a mop holder in 1837 and Thomas W. Stewart (U.S. patent #499,402) in 1893. At the 1968 Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can\\", which included mops. Types A mop =Dry mop, dust mop= A dry mop or dust mop is designed to pick up dry, loose contamination such as dust, earth, and sand from the surface of the floor. It consists of yarn and/or microfiber and can be used as a first step in cleaning a floor. Professional dry mops consist of a flat sheet of microfiber textile or sheets with a surface of looped yarn, usually about wide, and comes in variable lengths (usually ). The dry mop can in many instances replace a broom and has the ability to hold a limited amount of dust or sand within itself. The heads of dry mops are often removable and can be washed and replaced when saturated with dust. Another option is using a vacuum cleaner to suck surface dust away from the mop; however, this is much more limited in its effectiveness. Single- use dry mops are also available and widely sold. =Wet-mop, moist-mop= A wet mop or moist mop is, in professional cleaning, used as in the second step in the cleaning of a surface. The wet mop is swept over the surface to dissolve and absorb fat, mud and dried-in liquid contaminations. Professional wet mops consist of a flat sheet of microfiber textile or a sheet with a surface of looped yarn (which might contain microfiber as well), usually about wide, and come in various lengths (usually ).

File:Mop for wet or dry use, open end microfiber, looped yarn edge, velcro back, 60 cm.jpgFlat mop for dry or wet (pre-moisting) use. Open- end microfiber with looped yarn edges. Velcro back. =Mops for pre- moisting= Manual pre-moisting of wet-mops in bucket Professional flat mops are made for pre-moisting. Mops are pre-impregnated with an ideal amount of water mixed with an appropriate amount of detergent. This means that the cleaner does not need to bring any additional water on the cleaning trolley. This ideal amount is often recommended by the manufacturer in terms of weight percent of water per weight of the dry mop, for example \\"175% water per weight of the dry mop\\". Mops for pre-moisting are flat sheets of (often microfiber) textile, usually about wide, and comes in variable lengths (usually ). Mops for pre-moisting are fastened on a handle with a flat pad mount with the aid of velcro or a pouch on the mop, in which the pad on the handle fits. Pre- moisting can be done with a special washing machine or by hand by simply folding and packing the mops tight in a container and pouring the measured amount of water over them. The mops will then need about 5‚Äì10 minutes for the liquid to distribute evenly in their tissue before use. This offers some advantages: * The cleaner does not have to have a bucket of water with him/her when sweeping the floor, but simply carries an appropriate number of mops. This means the weight of the equipment can often be kept lower. * The risk of over-wetting the floor and leave puddles is eliminated if the wetness is ideal. =Hot mop= The hot mop (or steam mop) follows a similar concept to a steam iron. After adding water, the water is heated to make it exude on top of a floor, which can then be cleaned without using a cleaning solvent. These can work best on surfaces where a regular mop would also be used, such as bare floors, hearths, and laminate. =Syntho-mop= A syntho-mop such as the Scooba is not considered a mop, because even though it performs the same function as a traditional mop, the lack of hand operation makes it ineligible for status as a mop. =Microfiber mop= Microfiber mops are constructed of a blend of polyester and polyamide fibers which are ‚Äúsplit‚Äù and formed into a single fiber. This blend consists of 70-90% polyester that serves as the scrubbing and cleaning fiber and 10‚Äì30% polyamide which performs as the holding and quick drying fiber. This blend is usually expressed as a ratio on the label of the mop, e.g. an 80% polyester and 20% polyamide blend would be labeled as \\"80/20\\". Handles and mounting A mop handle consists of a long piece of wood or aluminium tubing fitted with a specific mount for the mop. The handle can be attached for mounting a mop on it by means of: * clamp * hanger (with strands doubled over the hanger) * plastic claws (attached to the strands) * pouch (as with many professional flat mops) * screwing (as with the classic yarn mop) * velcro (as with many professional flat mops) =Image gallery= Image:Mop, three different mop handles.jpgMop handles From left: Classic yarn mop handle made of aluminium (thread mount), unadjustable aluminium handle for velcro mop (50 cm), unadjustable aluminium handle for velcro mop (60 cm), scale included for reference.

This nail was several inches long with a point at the end and a flat head a couple or so inches wide. We would stand the nail on its flat head, cut pieces of old material into squares and push over the sharp end of the nail and when enough fix a piece of leather, then push the sharp point into the mop stale or handle. There was a knack of twisting these mops over the wrist to swish away surplus water, every woman could use one of these useful mops.\\"Maggie's Memories: Childhood Memories of Hickling.

Normally, it occurs spontaneously at full term either during or at the beginning of labor. Rupture of the membranes is known colloquially as \\"breaking the water\\" or as one's \\"water breaking\\". A premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a rupture of the amnion that occurs prior to the onset of labor. Sometimes, a child is born with no rupture of the amniotic sac (no rupture of membranes). In such cases, the child may still be entirely within the sac once born; such a birth is known as an en-caul birth. Effects When the amniotic sac ruptures, production of prostaglandins increases and the cushioning between the fetus and uterus is decreased, both of which are processes that increase the frequency and intensity of contractions.American Pregnancy Association > Inducing Labor Last Updated: 01/2007 On occasion, with the rupture of membranes, particularly if the head is not engaged, the umbilical cord may prolapse. A cord prolapse is an obstetrical emergency, as the descending head may block fetal-placental circulation. Once the membranes are ruptured, bacteria may ascend and could lead to amnionitis and fetal infection. Types *SROM: spontaneous rupture of membranes. This term describes the normal, spontaneous rupture of the membranes at full term. The rupture is usually at the bottom of the uterus, over the cervix, causing a gush of fluid. This gush may be quite small (such as 50ml), or it can be significantly large (200-300ml) depending upon amount of fluid in the amniotic sac, and to what extent the fetal head is plugging the hole and retaining fluid in the sac.kiwifamilies.co.nz > Birth > Spontaneous Rupture of Membranes By Paula Skelton, midwife *PROM : premature rupture of membranes.

He is best known as the first Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, in office from 1960 to 1968. Early years Coombs was born in Kalamunda, Western Australia, one of six children of a country railway stationmaster and a well-read mother. Coombs's political and economic views were formed by the Great Depression, which hit Australia in 1929 and caused a complete economic collapse in a country totally dependent on commodity exports for its prosperity. As a student in Perth, he was a socialist, but while he was studying at the London School of Economics, he became converted to the economic views of John Maynard Keynes. He spent the rest of his career pursuing Keynesian solutions to Australia's economic problems. He never sought public office nor joined a political party, but he sought to exercise political influence as an administrator and advisor. He won a scholarship to Perth Modern School. After five years there, he worked as a pupil-teacher for a year before spending two years at the Teachers' College. He then spent two years teaching at country schools, during which he studied for a Bachelor of Arts degree in the University of Western Australia (UWA), then the only free university in Australia. Transferring to a metropolitan school for the final two years, he graduated B.A. with first-class honours in economics and won a Hackett Studentship for overseas study. That was deferred for a year, enabling him to graduate M.A., also from UWA, and to marry fellow teacher Mary Alice ('Lallie') Ross at the end of 1931. As a student at UWA, Coombs was elected as the 1930 Sports Council president and subsequently the 1931 president of the Guild of Undergraduates. He then proceeded to the London School of Economics, where he studied under Harold Laski, one of the most influential Marxists of the 20th century. In 1933, he was awarded a PhD for a thesis on central banking. In 1934, he returned to a teaching position in Perth and combined it with part-time lecturing in economics at UWA. Public service In 1934, Coombs returned to Australia, and in 1935, he became an economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, then a state-owned bank that served as Australia's central bank. In 1939, he shifted to the Department of the Treasury in Canberra as a senior economist. He became known as a Keynesian rebel against the classical economics theory that had dominated the Treasury, under the influence of the Melbourne University school of economists, led by L. F. Giblin and Douglas Copland.See, e.g., Donald Markwell, Keynes and Australia, Reserve Bank of Australia, 2000, pages 46-7 & passim. The Australian Labor Party under John Curtin came to power in 1941, and Coombs found himself in a political environment much more supportive of his views. Curtin appointed him to the Commonwealth Bank board in October 1941. In 1942, the Treasurer, Ben Chifley, appointed him Director of Rationing, and in 1943 made him Director-General of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, a new ministry that Chifley held in addition to the Treasury. Coombs played a leading role in the preparation of the White Paper on Full Employment in Australia which, for the first time, committed the government to maintaining full employment from the post-WWII years. Chifley, a former train driver, had no training in economics and came to rely heavily on Coombs's advice. Coombs's closeness to Chifley and the greatly expanded role of government in the economy during World War II made him one of the most powerful public servants in Australian history. His influence further expanded when Chifley became prime minister in 1945. In January 1949, Chifley appointed Coombs as governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the most important post in the regulation of the Australian economy. When the Liberal Party came to power in December of that year, however, Coombs's demise seemed likely, but the new prime minister, Robert Menzies, kept him on and soon came to trust his judgement. Menzies was a moderate Keynesian, and there were few policy differences between the two men, especially since Australia soon embarked on a long postwar boom, and hardly any tough economic decisions needed to be made. In 1960, when the Reserve Bank of Australia was created to take over the Commonwealth Bank's central banking functions, Coombs was appointed governor of the Reserve Bank. At the time, he paid tribute to Sir Leslie Melville by advising the government and others that the best man for the job had been overlooked. He retired as a public servant in 1968. Later life Coombs continued to work following his retirement. He had already signalled his interest in the arts by becoming the first chairman of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1954 (named in honour of Elizabeth II, not because it promoted Elizabethan theatre). In 1967, he persuaded Prime Minister Harold Holt to legislate to create the Australian Council for the Arts (now the Australia Council) as a body for the public funding of the arts, and in 1968, he became its chairman. He worked closely with Prime Minister John Gorton to secure funding for an Australian film industry. He also became chancellor of the Australian National University (1968-1976), which he had helped found in 1946. He delivered the 1970 Buntine Oration, titled \\"Human Values - Education in the Changing Australian Society.\\" Coombs's most important post-retirement role was as a supporter of the Australian Aboriginal people. In 1967, he became chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, set up by the Holt Government in the wake of the referendum that gave the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate specifically for the Aboriginal people. He was, however, disappointed that the Gorton and McMahon Governments took up few of the Council's recommendations. He became a close advisor to the Labor leader Gough Whitlam in the years before Whitlam became prime minister in 1972, and he largely wrote Labor's policy on Aboriginal affairs, particularly the commitment to Aboriginal land rights. In 1972, he was named Australian of the Year. From 1972 to 1975, Coombs served as a consultant to Prime Minister Whitlam, but his influence was resented by other ministers. He found the experience of the first Labor government since 1949 disappointing. He disapproved of the events that led up to the Loans Affair of 1975 and the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, which led to the dismissal of Whitlam's government by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. He advised Whitlam not to resort to unorthodox means of financing government operations when the Senate blocked supply, but Whitlam did so anyway. Although he regarded the dismissal as scandalous, his estrangement from Whitlam meant that he took little subsequent part in politics. In 1975, he was chairman of a Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, which was tasked with examining the purpose, functions, organisation and management of Australian Government bodies and the structure and management of the Australian Public Service. Nevertheless, the Royal Commission report was largely ignored by the incoming Liberal government of Malcolm Fraser. In 1976, Coombs resigned all his posts and became a visiting fellow at the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at the Australian National University, where he developed a new interest in environmental issues. However, Aboriginal affairs remained his greatest passion and, in 1979, he launched the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, calling for a formal treaty between Australia and the Aboriginal people. The idea gained much public support but neither the Fraser government nor its successor, Bob Hawke's Labor government, took it up. From 1977 to 1979, Coombs was the president of the Australian Conservation Foundation.Fenner F. and Harris S. F. \\"Herbert Cole Coombs 1906-1997: Interest in environmental problems\\" at Australian Academy of Science Coombs deplored the breakdown of the postwar Keynesian economic consensus represented by Thatcherism, and in his 1990 book The Return of Scarcity he proposed a Common Wealth Estate to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth. He suffered a disabling stroke in late-1995 and died in Sydney in 1997. During the Howard government administration, the \\"Coombs legacy\\" in Aboriginal affairs came under increasing criticism. Journalist Piers Akerman argued that Coombs's policy amounted to \\"politically correct apartheid\\",Akerman, Piers. \\"One people - a hole (sic) lot of failed policies. Daily Telegraph, 30 May 2007.

The library was established on December 1, 1994 in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, with the merger of the former national library, Landsb√≥kasafn √çslands (est. 1818), and the university library (formally est. 1940). It is by far the largest library in Iceland with about one million items in various collections. The library's largest collection is the national collection containing almost all written works published in Iceland and items related to Iceland published elsewhere. The library is the main legal deposit library in Iceland. The library also has a large manuscript collection with mostly early modern and modern manuscripts, and a collection of published Icelandic music and other audio (legal deposit since 1977). The library houses the largest academic collection in Iceland, most of which can be borrowed for off-site use by holders of library cards. University students get library cards for free, but anyone can acquire a card for a small fee. The library is open for public access. The library main building is called √ûj√≥√∞arb√≥khla√∞an. It is a prominent red and white building near the main campus of the University of Iceland and the National Museum of Iceland. The building took 16 years to complete, finally opening in 1994, the year of the Icelandic republic's 50th anniversary. History Safnah√∫si√∞, where the National Library of Iceland was from 1908 to 1994 The first national library of Iceland, √çslands stiftisb√≥kasafn, was established at the instigation of Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn and the Icelandic Literary Society in 1818, and the first books of the library were gifts from Icelanders and Danes. From 1825 the library was housed in the loft of the newly renovated Reykjav√≠k Cathedral and in 1848 the first national librarian, folklorist J√≥n √Årnason, was hired to manage it. In 1847 the manuscript collection was started with the purchase of a large collection of manuscripts from the estate of bishop Steingr√≠mur J√≥nsson. On the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the settlement of Iceland in 1874 the library received many gifts and in 1883 J√≥n √Årnason estimated the total number of volumes in the library at 20,000. In 1881 the library moved into the new house of parliament, Al√æingish√∫s, and in 1886 the first Icelandic print law establishing the library as a legal deposit library was passed by the Al√æingi. After this the library grew fast and on its 100th anniversary in 1918 it counted 100,000 volumes. In 1906-1908 a special building, Safnah√∫si√∞, was erected to house the National Library, the National Museum, the Icelandic National Archives and the Icelandic Natural History Museum. The library of the University of Iceland was formally established in 1940 when the university moved into the Main Building. Before that time the individual departments had their own libraries. At the time it was debated whether it was practical to develop two academic state libraries in Iceland and so in 1947 a committee was established to decide on a division of tasks between them. Soon, a merger of the two libraries was proposed. In 1956 and 1966 two committees were set up to prepare for this eventuality. It seemed clear that a new specially designed building close to the university would be required. The idea was that this new library building, √ûj√≥√∞arb√≥khla√∞an, would be opened in 1974, on the 1100th anniversary of the settlement of Iceland. The two libraries began working towards this end and through UNESCO library experts were consulted as to the requirements of the new building. As the year 1974 drew near it became increasingly clear, however, that the Icelandic state would not be able to construct the building in time. The 1973 Oil Crisis, among other things, resulted in a worsening of the state's finances meaning that most of the ideas for the anniversary year had to be significantly reduced or scrapped. A groundbreaking ceremony for the new library was planned, instead of an inauguration, but even this was postponed until 1978 when construction finally began. Initially the building project proceeded well and in 1983 the building was complete on the outside. However, significant funds were needed to complete the interior and for the next ten years the large building stood empty. Attempts were made to finance its completion with a special supplement on property tax, but most of that income was used for other expenses. Finally in 1991 the new government of Sj√°lfst√¶√∞isflokkurinn and Al√æ√Ω√∞uflokkurinn made it a priority to complete the building and on December 1, 1994, it finally opened. While a lot of debate surrounded the building of √ûj√≥√∞arb√≥khla√∞an at the time, it resulted in vastly improved consultation, study and research facilities for researchers, university students and the general public in Iceland. The combination of the two libraries in one building resulted in an accessible library where users have direct access to the academic collection and reference works on the shelves while the national and manuscript collections are available for on- site consultation in a separate reading hall. While the study facilities of the University of Iceland have improved a lot since 1994, the library main building remains very popular with students. From 1888 to 1979 the National Library published a list of new books acquired each year. In 1979 this was replaced by the Icelandic National Bibliography, containing an overview of Icelandic published books each year. In October 1991 the two libraries implemented a joint online public access catalog system, Gegnir, gradually replacing the card catalogs. Since 2001 this system has been implemented nationwide for all public libraries in Iceland and is managed by a consortium. As of 2008 Gegnir can also be consulted via the European Library. Since 1996 the library has engaged in several large digitisation projects providing open access to antique maps of Iceland (1998): Timarit.is ‚Äì journals and newspapers (2002 in collaboration with the National Library of the Faroe Islands and the National Library of Greenland) ‚Äì, Handrit.is ‚Äì a catalog and digital library of manuscripts (in collaboration with the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies and the Arnamagn√¶an Institute) ‚Äì, and the online Icelandic National Bibliography (2008) among others. The library signed the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities in September 2012. Administration and roles The roles of the National and University Library are defined with a special law dating from 2011 and related regulations. The library is defined as an independent higher education institution under the Icelandic Ministry of Education, Science and Culture which commissions the library board, consisting of seven members, and the National Librarian. Administratively the library is divided into five sections; conservation, services, communication, acquisitions and administration. The section heads form the library executive board, along with the National Librarian. The library has the duty to collect and catalog all published Icelandic print, electronic and audio material for preservation and continued access. It is to manage its extensive manuscript collection and ensure the continued conservation of all the materials it collects. The library collects materials partly through receiving the legal deposit from publishers and partly through acquisitions and gifts. The legal deposit is defined in a special law dating from 2001 where the collection of electronic material published on the World Wide Web is defined as being one of the tasks of the library. Currently, the library collects snapshots of all web pages within the Icelandic top-level domain .is using the Heritrix web crawler. The library is the ISBN and ISSN national center in Iceland. It is also the national center for interlibrary loans. It has the role of coordinator for the national OPAC, Gegnir. The library has the duty to provide information and library service to the general public. It has a special duty to support the needs of teaching and research at the University of Iceland. The library manages subscriptions to scientific databases and electronic journals for the university and administers the office for national access to bibliographic databases and electronic journals, hvar.is, jointly financed by the Icelandic state and a consortium of Icelandic libraries, schools and research institutions and companies. Collections =Reference section= The reference section of the library contains reference works, manuals, encyclopedias, dictionaries and bibliographic registries etc. for on-site consultation. Within the reference section there are also computers for consulting the OPAC and for general use by guests. As these are part of the Internet of the University of Iceland, they have access to all electronic reference works that the university subscribes to in addition to the library subscriptions. The same applies to the wireless Internet hotspot available in the whole building. Part of the collection of reference works is available in the reading hall of the national and manuscript collections. =National collection= The national collection comprises all Icelandic published material in print, electronic or audiographic form collected through the legal deposit or acquired by other means. The library actively collects materials relating to Iceland published elsewhere and not subject to the Icelandic law on legal deposit. This equally applies to materials published online. This way, the library has created the most complete collection of Icelandic materials available anywhere in the world which it conserves, stores and makes available for on-site use in a special reading hall it shares with the manuscript collections. Access to highly valuable and rare items is restricted, but the library usually tries to make these available through its digital imaging production line. Within the national collection there are some private collections of individuals that are stored separately. =Manuscript collections= The library manuscript collections contain some 15,000 items, the oldest vellum manuscripts dating from around 1100 and are among the earliest examples of written Icelandic. Most of the collections are paper manuscripts, the oldest ones dating from the end of the 16th century. The youngest items are collections of manuscripts and letters, including electronic materials, from contemporary people which include some of Iceland's most prominent literary figures such as Halld√≥r Laxness. The manuscript collections of the library can be consulted in a separate reading hall where the items are provided by request for on-site use. Some of the manuscripts are cataloged in registers which are available in digital form on the library website. The library is currently working on creating an online catalog for manuscripts jointly with the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjav√≠k and the Arnamagn√¶an Institute in Copenhagen. =Audiovisual collection= The audiovisual collection of the library is available for on- site use using special facilities, screens and headphones, provided by the library. The collection includes materials that are part of the national collection as well as a large collection of international materials, records, films, television programs etc. The main emphasis of the collection, however, is to collect all Icelandic material and make it available to library guests. =Academic collection= The bulk of the academic collection consists of materials from the original library of the University of Iceland. It contains international scientific works and textbooks along with literary works in many languages, including a large collection of translations of Icelandic literature. By request, the library reserves textbooks used in courses taught at the University of Iceland to ensure that they are available for on-site study. Most of the academic collection, however, can be borrowed for off-site use by holders of library cards issued by the library. Students at the University of Iceland get such cards for free. Parts of the collection are available in two library branches on campus.

The name is an acronym for Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library. It has both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface. It is written in C, uses GTK+ as widget toolkit for creating its GUI, and calls gnuplot for generating graphs. The native scripting language of gretl is known as hansl (see below); it can also be used together with TRAMO/SEATS, R, Stata, Python, Octave, Ox and Julia. It includes natively all the basic statistical techniques employed in contemporary Econometrics and Time-Series Analysis. Additional estimators and tests are available via user-contributed function packages, which are written in hansl. gretl can output models as LaTeX files. Besides English, gretl is also available in Albanian, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, French, Galician, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese (both varieties), Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Ukrainian. Gretl has been reviewed several times in the Journal of Applied Econometrics and, more recently, in the Australian Economic Review. A review also appeared in the Journal of Statistical Software in 2008. Since then, the journal has featured several articles in which gretl is used to implement various statistical techniques.  Supported data formats  gretl offers its own fully documented, XML-based data format. It can also import ASCII, CSV, databank, EViews, Excel, Gnumeric, GNU Octave, JMulTi, OpenDocument spreadsheets, PcGive, RATS 4, SAS xport, SPSS, and Stata files. Since version 2020c, the GeoJSON and Shapefile formats are also supported, for thematic map creation. It can export to Stata, GNU Octave, R, CSV, JMulTi, and PcGive file formats.  hansl  Gretl has its own scripting language, called hansl (which is a recursive acronym for Hansl's A Neat Scripting Language). Hansl is a Turing-complete, interpreted programming language, featuring loops, conditionals, user-defined functions and complex data structures. It can be considered a domain-specific language for econometrics. Like other scientifically oriented programming languages, such as MATLAB and Julia, matrices are supported natively as a primitive variable type. Here's a simple example of hansl Running the above code produces A (2 x 2) 1 2 3 4 B (2 x 2) -2 1 1.5 -0.5 C (2 x 2) 1.0000 0.0000 8.8818e-16 1.0000 Phi(-3) = 0.001 Phi(-2) = 0.023 Phi(-1) = 0.159 Phi( 0) = 0.500 Phi( 1) = 0.841 Phi( 2) = 0.977 Phi( 3) = 0.999  Random Number Generation  Random Number Generation (RNG) in gretl has been examined and tested in Yalta & Schreiber (2012) . The authors conclude \\"Our results show that the RNG related procedures in gretl are implemented soundly and perform well in the three crush test suites of the TestU01\\".  Gretl as a teaching tool  Due to its libre nature and the breadth of econometric techniques it contains, gretl is widely used for teaching econometrics, from the undergraduate level onwards. Datasets in gretl format are available for several popular textbooks.

He is a former member of the New York State Assembly, the New York State Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. Kuhl represented New York's 29th congressional district for two terms before being defeated for reelection by Eric Massa in 2008.  Early life and education  Kuhl was born in Hammondsport, New York. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York with a B.A. in civil engineering in 1966, and then got a law degree from Syracuse University College of Law in 1969. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1970.\\"Meet the Freshmen of the House of Representatives\\", BIPAC, November 2004. Retrieved September 24, 2006. New York State Legislature Kuhl and Patricia McGee were allies in the New York State Senate. Kuhl was a member of the New York Assembly from 1981 to 1986, sitting in the 184th, 185th and 186th New York State Legislatures. In November 1986, after the retirement of William T. Smith, Kuhl ran for Smith's Senate seat and won. Kuhl was a member of the New York State Senate from 1987 to 2004, sitting in the 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 192nd, 193rd, 194th, 195th and 196th New York State Legislatures. He was appointed the Senate's Assistant Majority Leader for Operations at the beginning of the 1995 legislative session. One of Kuhl's signature issues in the state legislature was Upstate secession.Tierney, John (1999-05-24) The Big City; The Moochers From Upstate? Cut 'Em Loose, New York Times He regularly introduced a bill \\"to let New York City, Long Island and Westchester and Rockland Counties became a separate state called New York; the rest of the counties would become West New York. At least one poll in upstate has found the idea to be wildly popular.\\" Kuhl summed up his secessionist views by saying that \\"his constituents in the Finger Lakes region often wonder, 'Why don't you just cut the City of New York off and let it drift out to sea?'\\" In 1997, while serving as a state senator, Kuhl was arrested and convicted of driving while intoxicated. His driver's license was revoked for six months. House of Representatives = 2004 election = In 2004, Kuhl ran for the House seat of retiring U.S. Representative Amo Houghton, a Republican multimillionaire who had displayed a moderate bent during 18 years in Washington. In the Republican primary, Kuhl, who was supported by Houghton,Crestia DeGeorge, \\"The race for Amo Houghton's seat\\", Rochester City News (weekly) defeated Monroe County Legislator Mark Assini. He then defeated 27-year-old Democrat Samara Barend in the general election. = 2006 election = Kuhl's Democratic opponent in the 2006 elections was former Navy officer Eric Massa of Corning, a former Republican. In March 2006, Kuhl invited President George W. Bush to Canandaigua. In September 2006, Kuhl welcomed Vice President Dick Cheney to a major fundraiser in Rochester. Kuhl agreed with Cheney's assessment that combating terrorists around the world was the top issue in the campaign. According to Kuhl, bad news from the war zone should be countered by a frank discussion of reality. Regarding his Finger Lakes and Southern Tier constituents, Kuhl said, \\"They don't necessarily understand the full importance of our presence there\\".Robert J. McCarthy, \\"Cheney beats war drums stumping for Kuhl\\", Buffalo News, September 23, 2006 Preliminary results from the November election showed Kuhl narrowly beating Massa by a margin of approximately 5,600 votes (out of about 193,000 cast).Election results from \\"CBS News\\" , November 7, 2006 Massa had initially refused to concede the election and was expected to file a challenge, but on November 15, 2006 Massa conceded the election and contacted Kuhl to congratulate him.\\"Massa concedes, calls to congratulate Kuhl\\" , Elmira Star Gazette, November 15, 2006 According to the final election results, which were certified by the New York State Board of Elections on December 14, 2006, Kuhl won by a margin of 6,033 votes (out of 206,121 cast). =2008 election= Kuhl's again faced Democratic nominee and former Navy officer Eric Massa, losing the rematch by a narrow 51%-49% margin, roughly reversing the outcome of the 2006 elections.

He was one of the founding cartoonists for Mad in 1952. His cartoon characters are characterized by extremely distorted anatomy, including big heads, skinny legs and large feet. Early life Davis was born December 2, 1924, in Atlanta, Georgia. As a child, he adored listening to Bob Hope on the radio and tried to draw him, despite not knowing what Hope looked like. Career =Early work= Davis saw comic book publication at the age of 12 when he contributed a cartoon to the reader's page of Tip Top Comics No. 9 (December 1936). After drawing for his high school newspaper and yearbook, he spent three years in the U.S. Navy, where he contributed to the daily Navy News. Attending the University of Georgia on the G.I. Bill, he drew for the campus newspaper and helped launch an off-campus humor publication, Bullsheet, which he described as \\"not political or anything but just something with risque jokes and cartoons.\\" After graduation, he was a cartoonist intern at The Atlanta Journal, and he worked one summer inking Ed Dodd's Mark Trail comic strip, a strip which he later parodied in Mad as Mark Trade. =Comic strips and comic books= Mad, Cracked, Trump, Humbug and Help! In 1949, he illustrated a Coca-Cola training manual, a job that gave him enough money to buy a car and drive to New York. Attending the Art Students League of New York, he found work with the Herald Tribune Syndicate as an inker on Leslie Charteris's The Saint comic strip, drawn by Mike Roy in 1949‚Äì1950. His own humor strip, Beauregard, with gags in a Civil War setting, was carried briefly by the McClure Syndicate. After rejections from several comic book publishers, he began freelancing for William Gaines' EC Comics in 1950, contributing to Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror, The Haunt of Fear, Frontline Combat, Two- Fisted Tales, Piracy, Incredible Science Fiction, Crime Suspenstories, Shock Suspenstories and Terror Illustrated. In 2011, Davis told The Wall Street Journal about his early career and his breakthrough with EC: Davis was particularly noted for his depiction of the Crypt-Keeper in the horror comics, revamping the character's appearance from the more simplistic Al Feldstein version to a tougher, craggier, mangier man with hairy warts, salivating mouth and oversized hands and feet, who usually did not wear shoes. Among the classic horror tales he illustrated were \\"Foul Play\\", which was cited in Dr. Fredric Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent for its depiction of \\"a comic book baseball game\\". Others, like \\"Tain't the Meat, It's the Humanity\\", \\"Death of Some Salesman\\", \\"Fare Tonight Followed by Increasing Clottiness\\", \\"Tight Grip\\" and \\"Lower Berth\\", were Crypt-Keeper classics. He did the covers for every issue of Crypt from issue No. 29 to No. 46. In his work for Harvey Kurtzman's war comics, he tackled a variety of subjects and had a particular affinity for depicting American Civil War stories. He also did many covers for Frontline Combat, Two-Fisted Tales and Incredible Science Fiction as well. The editors, William M. Gaines, Albert B. Feldstein and Harvey Kurtzman, have said he was the fastest artist they had in those days, completely penciling and inking three or more pages a day at times. His use of the brush to create depth and mood was unique and memorable. His wrinkled clothing, scratchy lines, and multi-layered layouts were so popular in the 1950s that other artists at rival companies began copying the style‚Äînotably, Howard Nostrand in Harvey's horror comics. In the late 1950s, Davis drew Western stories for Atlas Comics. His 1963 work on the Rawhide Kid (#33-35) was his last for non- humor comic books. His style of wild, free-flowing brushwork and wacky characters made him a perfect choice when Harvey Kurtzman launched Mad as a zany, satirical EC comic book in 1952. He appeared in most of the first 30 issues of Mad, all 12 issues of Panic and even some work in Cracked. Davis contributed to other Kurtzman magazines‚ÄîTrump, Humbug and Help!‚Äîeventually expanding into illustrations for record jackets, movie posters, books and magazines, including Time and TV Guide. He completed an 88-card set of humorous cartoons called Wacky Plaks, which Topps Chewing Gum Co. released in 1959. He also illustrated a 66-card set called Funny Monsters and a 66-card set of Funny Valentine cards in 1959, also released by Topps Chewing Gum Co. In 1960, Jack illustrated another 66-card set of Funny Valentine cards and in 1961, he illustrated a set of Giant Funny Valentine cards. In 1964, he illustrated a set of Nutty Awards postcards, also released by Topps Chewing Gum Co., and in 1980 he helped illustrate a set of Topps Bazooka Wanted Posters. Jack illustrated two children's picture books, Bobby and the Magic Pen and The Misadventures of Don Quixote (both still available online). In 1961, he wrote, drew and edited his own comic book, Yak Yak, for Dell Comics. In 1965, he illustrated Meet The North American Indians by Elizabeth Payne, published by Random House as part of their children's Step Up Books line. (). He returned as a regular contributor to Mad magazine in the mid-1960s and appeared in nearly every issue after that for decades. He also drew many covers for the magazine, especially in the 1970s. Davis also had a regular comic strip feature, Superfan, in Pro Quarterback magazine in the early 1970s. It was written by his Mad cohort, Nick Meglin. =Advertising and magazines= Davis first worked with TV Guide in 1965, which hired him to illustrate an expansive eight-page advertising supplement for NBC's TV lineup, which featured icons such as Johnny Carson, Dean Martin and fictional characters such as Dr. Kildare, Napoleon Solo and Maxwell Smart. His first cover for the magazine came in 1968, when he depicted a tribute to Andy Griffith, in which the actor was hoisted on the shoulders of his costars, Don Knotts and Jim Nabors. Davis recalls, \\"Every assignment was a thrill because TV Guide was the top magazine in the country. I couldn't wait to get in my little MG and drive from New York out to the magazine's offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania, to show the editors my latest design. I felt like the luckiest guy in the world.\\" Davis would contribute 23 covers for TV Guide between 1968 and 1981. In 2013 the magazine honored him in a retrospective in which it recounted his history with the publication and spotlighted some of his most memorable covers, including those depicting Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (March 28, 1970), Davis' childhood hero Bob Hope for a cover on Hope's history with the Oscars (April 10, 1971) and Bonanza (August 14, 1971). Years later, while watching a TV interview of Hope, Davis was gratified to notice that his Hope cover was displayed on the back wall of the comedian's office; \\"it was one of the proudest moments of my life,\\" recalled Davis. Davis created the cartoon bee which (in decal form) appears on the flanks of all the buses in the Bee-Line running from Westchester to New York City. A Westchester resident at the time, Davis lived directly adjacent to one of the Bee Line's bus routes, and he mentioned in an interview how gratifying it was to see his own artwork drive past his window several times every day. Similar synchronicity happened when Mad moved to 1700 Broadway, where the magazine's fifth-floor production department was next to a wall three feet away that had previously been the location of an immense Davis cartoon for a bank, an advertisement that towered six stories over 53rd Street. =Films, posters, and cover art= Like fellow Mad alumnus Paul Coker, Jr., Davis also contributed to Rankin-Bass productions; his character designs are featured in Mad Monster Party, The Coneheads and the cartoon series The King Kong Show, The Jackson 5ive and The Osmonds. For Raid insecticide, Davis created the animated bug that screamed \\"Raid?!\\" Phil Kimmelman Associates created several commercials designed by Davis and animated in his style. Davis produced the artwork for the poster for the 1963 comedy chase film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. In 2014, he remembered an experience from that year: \\"My dad had Parkinson's disease, and he paid me a visit. He really had not been to New York in‚Äîwell, ever‚Äîand he came out of the station and saw the signboard [advertising the film], very big signboard in Times Square. That was a big thrill. Little old me ...\\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3033-working-with-jack-davis Two years later, he parodied his own Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World image for the cover of the Mad paperback It's a World, World, World, World Mad, his first work for the magazine following an almost seven-year hiatus. Having returned, Davis would remain a regular freelancer for more than thirty years. When the Criterion Collection released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in 2014, Davis provided new illustrations for the accompanying booklet. Davis' artwork for the comedy Western Viva Max! (1969) formed the centerpiece of that film's promotional campaign, and he did the same for the film Kelly's Heroes in 1970. His poster for Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) presented the film in a comic light. In 1963 Davis produced a work of cover art for the Richard Wolfe album, Many Happy Returns of the Day! released by MGM Records, and designed the Homer and Jethro album, Homer and Jethro Go West (RCA Victor). In 1966, Davis created the cover art for the Johnny Cash album Everybody Loves a Nut. Davis also created album artwork for such musicians as The Guess Who, Tito Puente, Sailcat, and The Cowsills, as well as for such comedians as Bob and Ray, Archie Campbell, Don Imus and Myron Cohen. He also provided the artwork for several of Sheb Wooley's comic albums as his character Ben Colder.https://rateyourmusic.com/list/darb321/album_covers_by_jack_davis/ During his tenure with Mad, Davis' specialty was drawing sports-themed articles. This led to his work for Paramount Pictures, painting the poster for The Bad News Bears (1976). = Mascot = While Davis resided on St. Simons Island, Georgia, he sketched various characters and mascots for the College of Coastal Georgia in Brunswick, Georgia. His drawing of the Mariner, Capt. Jack, was ultimately selected by the college students and staff as the official school mascot. Personal life and death Davis grew up and went to college in Georgia. Following his professional career in New York, Davis and his wife Dena moved to St. Simons Island, Georgia in the 1990s.

He was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 2005. In 1989, Davis was commissioned by the United States Postal Service to design the 25-cent Letter Carriers stamp. There was some concern that the cartoon would offend some letter carriers as being too informal and not respectful of their position. However, the president of the Letter Carriers Union gave his blessing, and the stamp was well received. Although postal policy does not allow artists to portray living persons on stamps, one of the carriers in the stamp is an unmistakable self-portrait of Davis. In 2019, Davis was posthumously awarded the Inkwell Awards Stacey Aragon Special Recognition Award for his lifetime of work in the inking field.

He was a favourite of King John II of Castile, a Constable of Castile and Grand Master of the military order of Santiago. Early years He was born between 1388 and 1390 in Ca√±ete, in what is now the province of Cuenca, as the illegitimate son of the Castilian noble don √Ålvaro Mart√≠nez de Luna, copero mayor (the page who poured drinks for a nobleman) of King Henry III of Castile, and Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez de Jarana, a woman of great character and beauty. He was introduced to the court as a page by his uncle Pedro V de Luna, Archbishop of Toledo in 1410. √Ålvaro soon secured a commanding influence over John II, then a boy. During the regency of King John's uncle Ferdinand, which ended in 1412, he was not allowed to be more than a servant. When, however, Ferdinand was elected king of Aragon, and the regency was assumed by the king's mother, Catherine of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, and granddaughter of King Peter of Castile, √Ålvaro became a very important person, the so-called \\"contino\\", or old friend of the King.  The King's favourite  Statue of √Ålvaro de Luna in Ca√±ete The young King regarded him with love and affection which the superstition of later time attributed to witchcraft. As the King was under pressure by greedy and unscrupulous nobles ‚Äî among whom his cousins, the sons of Ferdinand, commonly known as the Infantes of Aragon, were perhaps the most dangerous ‚Äî his reliance on a favourite who had every motive to be loyal to him, is quite understandable.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition. Luna was also a master of all the accomplishments the King admired: a fine horseman, skillful with a lance and a writer of court verse. But beyond the purview of his peers, he was a master of intrigue and dissimulation. Until he lost the King's protection, √Ålvaro was the central figure of the Castilian history of the time. It was a period of constant conflict, characterised by shifting coalitions of nobles, namely the Infantes of Aragon Henry and John of Aragon, brothers of John II's wife Maria, who, under the pretence of freeing the King from the undue influence of his favourite, were intent on making a puppet of him for their own ends. The part which √Ålvaro de Luna played has been diversely judged. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition recounts that to Juan de Mariana he appears as a mere self-seeking favourite. To others, he has seemed to be a loyal servant of the King who endeavoured to enforce the authority of the crown, which in Castile was the only alternative to anarchy. He fought for his own ends, but his supremacy was perhaps better than the rule of lawless alliances of plundering nobles. In 1427, he was solemnly expelled by a coalition of the nobles, only to be recalled in the following year. In 1431, he endeavoured to employ the restless nobles in a campaign for the reconquest of Granada, the remaining territory of Muslim Spain and then ruled by the sultan Muhammed IX. Some successes were gained at the Battle of La Higueruela, but in the end de Luna failed. A consistent policy was impossible with a rebellious aristocracy and a king of indolent character. In 1445, the faction of nobles allied with √Ålvaro's main enemies, the Infantes of Aragon, were defeated at the First Battle of Olmedo. One of them, Infante Henry, Duke of Villena, brother of the Queen, died of his wounds. Luna, who had been Constable of Castile and Count of San Esteban de Gormaz since 1423, became Grand Master of the Order of Santiago by election of the Knights.  Downfall  Sad end of Don √Ålvaro de Luna. Painting by Jos√© Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez de Losada (1826‚Äì1896) Queen Maria died under suspicious circumstances, pointing to Luna as the mastermind. Nevertheless, his power appeared to be thoroughly established. It was, however, based only on the personal affection of the King. The King's second wife, Isabella of Portugal, although her whole royal marriage was a product of Luna's arrangements, was soon offended by the immense influence of the Constable, and when the murder of the King's accountant Alfonso P√©rez de Vivero was suspected to have been at Luna's orders, she urged her husband to free himself from thralldom to his favourite. In 1453, the King succumbed to his wife's demands; Luna was arrested, tried and condemned to death in a process which was a mere parody of justice, and soon executed by beheading at Valladolid on 2 June 1453.  Marriage and issue  By his marriage with Juana Pimentel, √Ålvaro de Luna had two children, his legitimate heirs: * Juan de Luna, 2nd Count of Santisteban, San Esteban de Gormaz; married Leonor de Zuniga y Lara, daughter of the Duke of Bejar. * Mar√≠a de Luna, 3rd Countess of Santesteban, the heiress after her brother's premature death. She married √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza y Luna, 2nd Duke of the Infantado. By a mistress, Margarida de Villena, √Ålvaro de Luna had an illegitimate son: * Pedro de Luna, Lord of Fuentiduena.

Barnafoss is on the river Hv√≠t√° in Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur. Hraunfossar flows out of a lava field into Hv√≠t√° near Barnafoss, creating a stunning scenery. Barnafoss in folk mythology Many Icelandic folk tales have been associated with Barnafoss, the most famous being about two boys from a nearby farm, Hrauns√°s. One day, the boys' parents went with their ploughmen to a church. The boys were supposed to stay at home, but as they grew bored they decided to follow their parents. They made a shortcut and crossed a natural stone-bridge that was above the waterfall. But on their way, they felt dizzy and fell into the water and drowned. When their mother found out what had happened, she put a spell on the bridge saying that nobody would ever cross it without drowning himself. A little while later, the bridge was demolished in an earthquake. Another waterfall, Barnafoss, is on the River Skj√°lfandaflj√≥t near the abandoned farm Barnafell in Lj√≥savatn County. There the river runs in a narrow, and close to deep canyon. According to legends, young and brave men jumped across its narrowest parts. During prolonged subzero periods, the spray creates an ice arch across the river above the waterfall and sometimes a rope was strung across the river there to quicken this development. Flocks of sheep were driven over that bridge to graze on √ûingey, the island between the two branches of the river.

Leo Tolstoy described Ruskin as, \\"one of those rare men who think with their heart.\\" A champion of the work of J. M. W. Turner, Ruskin detested the work of James McNeill Whistler An art critic is a person who is specialized in analyzing, interpreting and evaluating art. Their written critiques or reviews contribute to art criticism and they are published in newspapers, magazines, books, exhibition brochures and catalogues and on web sites. Some of today's art critics use art blogs and other online platforms in order to connect with a wider audience and expand debate about art. Differently from art history, there is not an institutionalized training for art critics (with only few exceptions); art critics come from different backgrounds and they may or may not be university trained.James Elkins, What happened to art criticism, Prickley Paradigm Press, 2003, p. 8. Professional art critics are expected to have a keen eye for art and a thorough knowledge of art history. Typically the art critic views art at exhibitions, galleries, museums or artists' studios and they can be members of the International Association of Art Critics which has national sections. Very rarely art critics earn their living from writing criticism. The opinions of art critics have the potential to stir debate on art related topics. Due to this the viewpoints of art critics writing for art publications and newspapers adds to public discourse concerning art and culture. Art collectors and patrons often rely on the advice of such critics as a way to enhance their appreciation of the art they are viewing. Many now famous and celebrated artists were not recognized by the art critics of their time, often because their art was in a style not yet understood or favored. Conversely, some critics, have become particularly important helping to explain and promote new art movements ‚Äì Roger Fry with the Post-Impressionist movement, Lawrence Alloway with pop art as examples.  Controversies  According to James ElkinsJames Elkins, \\"Introduction\\" in Is Art History Global?, dir. James Elkins, Routledge Taylor & Francis Group, 2007, pp. 5‚Äì15. there is a distinction between art criticism and art history based on institutional, contextual and commercial criteria; the history of art criticism is taught in universities, but the practice of art criticism is excluded institutionally from academia. An experience-related article is Agnieszka Gratza. Always according to James Elkins in smaller and developing countries, newspaper art criticism normally serves as art history. James Elkins's perspective portraits his personal link to art history and art historians and in What happened to art criticism he furthermore highlights the gap between art historians and art critics by suggesting that the first rarely cite the second as a source and that the second miss an academic discipline to refer to.James Elkins, What Happened to Art Criticism, Prickley Paradigm Press, 2003, pp. 4‚Äì5, 9.

Women with gestational choriocarcinoma may present with abnormal vaginal bleeding, persistent markedly elevated Œ≤hCG, or a history of prior pregnancy. Most patients develop gestational choriocarcinoma shortly after gestational anomalies, but pathology may occur after a long latency of years. It may occur during pregnancy. Often, it happens after a growth of some sort in the womb (pregnancy, tumor, mole, cyst) Diagnosis Grossly, a red hemorrhagic mass is seen in the uterus, though it may vary in size. Often, diagnosis is presumptive, and based on clinical findings and the identification of a malignant trophoblast. One prevalent symptom is vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy, abortion, or hydatid mole. A pregnancy test will be positive even if there is no embryo/fetus. Treatment Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. In certain cases, a hysterectomy and radiation are necessary. Prognosis At the time of diagnosis, more than 90% of patients already have lung metastases, though there are also less frequent metastases to the brain and liver. With chemotherapy, there is an 80% 5-year survival rate. Ultimately, death is related to liver and brain metastases.

Evidence for a historical Joaquin is scarce. Contemporary documents record testimony concerning a minor horse thief by the same name in 1852. Bandidos with the name 'Joaquin' involved in the robbery and murder of several Chinese were reported by newspapers during the same time. A California Ranger by the name of Harry Love was tasked with and eventually brought in a human head claimed to be that of Murieta. The popular legend of Joaquin Murrieta was that he was a Sonoran forty-niner, a vaquero and a gold miner and peace-loving man driven to seek revenge when he and his brother were falsely accused of stealing a mule. His brother was hanged and Joaquin horsewhipped. His young wife was gang raped and in one version she died in Joaquin's arms. Swearing revenge, Joaquin hunted down all who had violated his sweetheart. He embarked on a short but violent career that brought death to his Anglo tormentors. The state of California then offered a reward of up to $5,000 for Joaquin \\"dead or alive.\\" He was reportedly killed in 1853, but the news of his death were disputed and myths later formed about him and his possible survival. In 1919, Johnston McCulley supposedly received his inspiration for his fictional character Don Diego de la Vega‚Äîbetter known as Zorro‚Äîfrom the 1854 book entitled The Life and Adventures of Joaqu√≠n Murieta: The Celebrated California Bandit by John Rollin Ridge. John heard about a Mexican miner who had turned to banditry and was intrigued by the story. Controversy over his life Controversy surrounds the figure of Joaquin Murrieta: who he was, what he did, and many of his life's events. This is summarized by the words of historian Susan Lee Johnson: > \\"So many tales have grown up around Murrieta that it is hard to disentangle > the fabulous from the factual. There seems to be a consensus that Anglos > drove him from a rich mining claim, and that, in rapid succession, his wife > was raped, his half-brother lynched, and Murrieta himself horse-whipped. He > may have worked as a monte dealer for a time; then, according to whichever > version one accepts, he became either a horse trader and occasional horse > thief, or a bandit.\\" John Rollin Ridge, grandson of the Cherokee leader Major Ridge, wrote a dime novel about Murrieta; the fictional biography contributed to his legend, especially as it was translated into various European languages. A portion of Ridge's novel was reprinted in 1858 in the California Police Gazette. This story was picked up and subsequently translated into French. The French version was translated into Spanish by Roberto Hyenne, who took Ridge's original story and changed every \\"Mexican\\" reference to \\"Chilean\\". Early life and education Most biographical sources hold that Murrieta was born in Hermosillo*\\"Review: Roaring Camp: The Social World of the California Gold Rush\\", American Scholar, 1 January 2000, p. 142 Vol. 69 No. 1 . in the northwestern state of Sonora, Mexico. The historian Frank Forrest Latta, in his twentieth-century book Joaqu√≠n Murrieta and His Horse Gangs (1980), wrote based on his decades of investigations of the Murrieta family in Sonora, California and Texas, that Joaquin Murrieta was from the Pueblo de Murrieta on the Rancho Tapizuelas, across the Cuchujaqui River, (known locally as the Arroyo de √Ålamos), to the north of Casanate, in the southeast of Sonora, near the Sinaloa border, within what is now the √Ålamos Municipality, of Sonora. He was educated at a school nearby in El Salado. 1849 Migration to California Joaquin Murietta (1868) by Charles Christian Nahl Murrieta reportedly went to California in 1849 to seek his fortune in the California Gold Rush. His older Carrillo stepbrother Joaquin Carrillo, who was already in California wrote back about the 1848 gold discovery and told Joaquin to come to California. Like many Sonorans, Murrieta and a party including his new wife Rosa Feliz, came to California across the Altar and Colorado Deserts in 1849. This party included Joaquin's younger brother (Jesus Murrieta), Jesus Carrillo Murrieta his other Carrillo stepbrother, three Feliz brothers-in-law (Claudio, Reyes and Jesus), two Murrieta cousins (Joaquin Juan and Martin Murrieta), four Valenzuela cousins (including Joaquin Theodoro and Jesus Valenzuela), two Duarte cousins (Antonio and Manuel Duarte), and a few other men from Pueblo de Murrieta or nearby. Five Joaquins Gang Joaqu√≠n Murrieta encountered prejudice and hostility in the extreme competition of the rough mining camps. While mining for gold, he and his wife supposedly were attacked by American miners jealous of his success. They allegedly beat him and raped his wife. However, the source for these events is not considered reliable, as it was a dime novel, The Life and Adventures of Joaqu√≠n Murieta, written by John Rollin Ridge and published in 1854. Latta wrote that Joaqu√≠n Murrieta's gang had well organized bands, one led by himself and the rest led by one or two of his Sonoran relatives that he had grown up with. Latta documented that the core of these men had first gathered to help Murrieta kill at least six of the Americans who had summarily hanged his stepbrother Jesus Carrillo and whipped him on the false charge of the theft of a mule. They then regularly engaged in illegal horse trade with Mexico, with stolen horses and legally captured mustangs, driving them from as far north as Contra Costa County and from the gold camps of the Sierras and from the Central Valley via the remote La Vereda del Monte trail through the Diablo Range then south to Sonora for sale.Frank F.

Latta's uncle may have been one of their victims. Samuel N. Latta disappeared and was never heard from again. He disappeared after writing a letter to his wife and daughters from Robinson's Ferry saying he had sold his gold claim and in a few days was going out to Stockton and San Francisco for his trip home to Arkansas with $8,000 in gold. Latta, JOAQUIN MURRIETA, p.43 The gang is believed to have killed up to 28 Chinese and 13 Anglo-Americans. This figure only takes account of the reports from their raids in early 1853. By 1853, the California state legislature considered Murrieta enough of a criminal menace to list him as one of the so- called \\"Five Joaquins\\" on a bill passed in May 1853. The legislature authorized hiring for three months a company of 20 California Rangers, veterans of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, to hunt down \\"the five Joaquins, whose names are Joaquin Muriati [sic], Joaquin Ocomorenia, Joaquin Valenzuela, Joaquin Botellier, and Joaquin Carillo, and their banded associates.\\"The Statutes of California passed at the Fourth Session of the Legislature, George Kerr, State Printer, 1853, p.194 An Act to Create a Company of Rangers On May 11, 1853, the governor John Bigler signed an act to create the \\"California State Rangers,\\" to be led by Captain Harry Love (a former Texas Ranger and Mexican War veteran). The state paid the California Rangers $150 a month, and promised them a $1,000 governor's reward if they captured the wanted men. On July 25, 1853, a group of Rangers encountered a band of armed Mexican men near Arroyo de Cantua on the edge of the Diablo Range near Coalinga, California. In the confrontation, three of the Mexicans were killed. They claimed one was Murrieta, and another Manuel Garcia, also known as Three-Fingered Jack, one of his most notorious associates. Two others were captured. A plaque (California Historical Landmark #344) near Coalinga at the intersection of State Routes 33 and 198 now marks the approximate site of the incident. A poster advertising the display of the supposed head of Murrieta in Stockton, CA. 1853 As proof of the outlaws' deaths, the Rangers cut off Three-Fingered Jack's hand, and the alleged Murrieta's head, and preserved them in a jar of alcohol to bring to the authorities for their reward. Officials displayed the jar in Mariposa County, Stockton, and San Francisco. The Rangers took the display throughout California; spectators could pay $1 to see the relics. Seventeen people, including a Catholic priest, signed affidavits identifying the head as Murrieta's, alias Carrillo. Love and his Rangers received the $1,000 reward money. In August 1853, an anonymous Los Angeles-based man wrote to the San Francisco Alta California Daily that Love and his Rangers murdered some innocent Mexican mustang catchers, and bribed people to swear out affidavits.Alta California, August 23, 1853, p.2, The Head of Joaquin Murieta not Taken - A Strange Story Later that fall, California newspapers carried letters by a few men claiming that Capt. Love had failed to display Murrieta's head at the mining camps, but this was not true.Democratic State Journal, Oct. 17, 1853, Calaveras Correspondence from W. C. P. of Mokelumne Hill; San Joaquin Republican, Oct. 20, 1853, correspondence from Sonora, Tuolumne Co. On May 28, 1854, the California State Legislature voted to reward the Rangers with another $5,000 for their defeat of Murrieta and his band.WPA, \\"California State Rangers: History\\", 1940, California State Military Museum, accessed 7 August 2011 But, 25 years later, the myths began to form. In 1879, O. P. Stidger was reported to have heard Murrieta's sister say that the displayed head was not her brother's.See The Pioneer, Sat., Nov. 29, 1879. Also see History of Nevada County (Oakland : Thompson & West, 1880; rprt Berkeley: Howell-North Books, 1970), 115. At around the same time, numerous sightings were reported of Murrieta as a middle aged man. These were never confirmed. His preserved head was destroyed during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire. Murrieta's nephew, known as Procopio, became one of California's most notorious bandits of the 1860s and 1870s; he purportedly wanted to exceed the reputation of his uncle. The Real Zorro Zorro's first appearance, in the August 1919 issue of The All-Story Murrieta was possibly partly the inspiration for the fictional character of Zorro, the lead character in the five-part serial story, \\"The Curse of Capistrano\\", written by Johnston McCulley, and published in 1919 in a pulp fiction magazine. For some activists, Murrieta had come to symbolize the resistance against Anglo- American economic and cultural domination in California. The \\"Association of Descendants of Joaquin Murrieta\\" says that Murrieta was not a \\"gringo eater,\\" but \\"He wanted to retrieve the part of Mexico that was lost at that time in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\\" Representations in media Joaquin Murrieta has been a widely used romantic figure in novels, stories, comics and films, and on TV.

During early embryogenesis it consists of the extraembryonic coelom, also called the chorionic cavity. The gestational sac is normally contained within the uterus. It is the only available structure that can be used to determine if an intrauterine pregnancy exists until the embryo is identified. On obstetric ultrasound, the gestational sac is a dark (\\"anechoic\\") space surrounded by a white (\\"hyperechoic\\") rim. Structure The gestational sac is spherical in shape, and usually located in the upper part of the fundus of the uterus. By approximately 9 weeks of gestational age, the amniotic sac has expanded to occupy the majority of the volume of the gestational sac, eventually expanding to reduce the extraembryonic coelom to a thin layer between the amnion membrane and the mesoderm. By then, the gestational sac is usually simply called the \\"amniotic sac\\". =Development= During embryogenesis, the extraembryonic coelom (or chorionic cavity) that constitutes the gestational sac is a portion of the conceptus consisting of a cavity between Heuser's membrane and the Trophoblast. During formation of the primitive yolk sac, some of the migrating hypoblast cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells that fill the space between Heuser's membrane and the Trophoblast, forming the extraembryonic mesoderm. As development progresses, small lacunae begin to form within the extraembryonic mesoderm which enlarge to become the extraembryonic coelom. The extraembryonic coelom divides the extraembryonic mesoderm into two layers: extraembryonic splanchnopleuric mesoderm, which lies adjacent to Heuser's membrane around the outside of the primitive yolk sac, and extraembryonic somatopleuric mesoderm, which lies adjacent to the cytotrophoblast layer of the embryo. The chorionic cavity is enclosed by the chorionic plate, which is composed of an inner layer of somatopleuric mesoderm and an outer layer of trophoblast cells. Clinical significance =Ultrasound= Mean gestational sac diameter by gestational age. The blue line is the mean, and the green area delimits the 5th and the 95th percentiles. Crown rump length before a gestational age of 6 weeks is extrapolated by assuming a gestational sac diameter of 0 at a gestational age of 2 weeks, corresponding to a fertilization age of 0 weeks. This extrapolated part is blurred because of uncertain values. A: Gestational sac (GS), B: Crown rump length (CRL) of embryo, C: Amniotic sac, D: Yolk sac The mean sac diameter (MSD) can effectively estimate gestational age between 5 and 6 weeks, with an accuracy of about +/- 5 days. The yolk sac and embryo should be readily identifiable when the gestational sac reaches a certain size ‚Äî a yolk sac should be seen when the gestational sac is 20mm and a fetal pole should be seen when the gestational sac reaches 25mm. Gestational sacs can be identified via ultrasound and are generally identified by the following 4 characteristics: # The sac has a round or elliptical shape in longitudinal and transverse views # it is surrounded by a white echogenic rim (\\"choriodecidual reaction\\") # The sac is located in the uterine fundus # The sac is not implanted on the midline, but eccentrically (to one side of the uterine cavity line).

Background Kular was born to a Sikh family in Punjab, and received a medical degree from Guru Nanak Dev University. He moved to Canada in 1974, and completed two years of residency training in paediatrics at the IWK Health Centre at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. He then worked for two years at the Canadian Armed Forces Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia before starting a family practice in Campbellton, New Brunswick in 1978. In 1986, Kular founded a family and sports medicine clinic in Brampton, Ontario, a city which has a large number of recent Indo-Canadian immigrants. He was also a founding member of the Northern Indian Medical and Dental Association of Canada. Politics In the 2003 election, Kular ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Bramalea-Gore- Malton-Springdale. During the campaign, it came to light that Kular had previously been disciplined by the Physician's Board. Despite the news, he defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Raminder Singh Gill by 3,765 votes. In June 2005, he was a member of the Speaker of the Ontario Legislature‚Äôs multi-party delegation in to the 43rd Canadian Regional Conference for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in St. John's, Newfoundland.

In January, 2009, Kular was a member of the Premier's delegation of government and business leaders who went on a trade mission to India to develop stronger ties with this emerging market. In October 2009, Kular was involved in an incident where he allegedly hit a pedestrian while driving in Brampton. He was charged with leaving the scene of the accident. A month later Kular resigned as parliamentary assistant to the minister of Health and Long-Term Care. In June 2010, Kular was acquitted due to contradictory evidence from witnesses. Kular was subsequently reappointed to his old post as parliamentary assistant. In the 2011 election, he was defeated by New Democratic Party candidate Jagmeet Singh by 2,120 votes. He ran again in the 2014 election, again losing to Singh.

Poet, novelist, and historian, his History of South Carolina served as the definitive textbook on state history for much of the 20th century. Literary scholars consider him a major force in antebellum Southern literature; in 1845 Edgar Allan Poe pronounced him the best novelist America had ever produced.

The precocious Simms was raised by his grandmother, Mrs. Jacob Gates, who had lived through the American Revolutionary War and who told Simms stories about it.1911 Britannica. In his teen years, Simms worked as a clerk in a drugstore and aspired to study medicine.Appleton's Cyclopedia Vol. 5, p. 533.

After her death, he married Chevillette Eliza Roach (pronounced \\"Roche\\"), with whom he had 14 children, only 5 of whom lived to adulthood. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1827; however, he soon abandoned this profession for literature. = Early writings = Drawing of SimmsSimms first wrote poetry at the age of eight. In his 19th year, he produced a monody on General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (Charleston, 1825). Two years later, in 1827, he published Lyrical and Other Poems and Early Lays. In 1828 he became a journalist as well as editor and part owner of the City Gazette, a position he held until 1832 when the publication failed. Simms devoted his attention entirely to writing and in rapid succession published The Vision of Cortes, Cain, and Other Poems (1829); The Tricolor, or Three Days of Blood in Paris (1830); and his strongest long poem, Atalantis, a Tale of the Sea (1832). Atalantis established his fame as an author. His novel Martin Faber, the Story of a Criminal, an expanded version of an earlier short story called \\"The Confessions of a Murderer\\", was published in 1833. This gained Simms a national audience. =Editor and politician= Simms also edited several South Carolina newspapers, and in the 1840s and 1850s edited important southern journals, including the Magnolia,' the Southern and Western, and the proslavery Southern Quarterly Review.https://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/simms1/bio.html During the nullification controversy prompted by South Carolina in 1832, Simms supported Union. In the 1840s he pushed for American freedom from British literary models and supported the intensely nationalistic Young America group. Based on the popularity of the novels described below, Simms became part of the Southern planter class. He came to firmly support slavery (a \\"fire-eater\\"), an attitude that when held widely by Southerners helped lead to secession and creation of the Confederate States of America and the American Civil War. Elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, Simms served from 1844‚Äì1846. However he lost election for lieutenant governor of South Carolina by only one vote. = Novels about the South = Simms wrote a number of popular books between 1830 and 1860, sometimes focusing on the pre-colonial and colonial periods of Southern history, and replete with local color. His first hit was The Yemassee (1835, about the Yemassee War of 1715 in the South Carolina low country). Simms also published eight novels set in South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, beginning with The Partisan (1835), which was perhaps Simms's most-read novel, and Katharine Walton (1851). Other South Carolina-related books included Mellichampe (1836), The Kinsmen (1841), Woodcraft (1854), The Forayers (1855), Eutaw (1856), and Joscelyn (1867). He later published ten novels dealing with the expansion into the frontier territory from Georgia to Louisiana, including Richard Hurdis; or, the Avenger of Blood. A Tale of Alabama (1838) and Border Beagles: A Tale of Mississippi (1840). He also wrote about the conflicts between Native Americans, Spaniards and French in Florida in The Lily and the Totem, or, The Huguenots in Florida (1850); Vasconselos (1853; an account of DeSoto's expedition from the Native American viewpoint); and The Cassique of Kiawah (1859; about the Native American experience in South Carolina during the American Revolution and originally drafted when he was 18, although published after his later popularity). Some believe The Cassique of Kiawah to be Simms's finest novel. At first, Southern readers, especially those in his home town of Charleston, did not support Simms's work, in part because he lacked an aristocratic background. Eventually, however, he was referred to as the Southern version of James Fenimore Cooper, and Charleston residents invited him into their prestigious St. Cecilia Society. In 1845, Simms published The Wigwam and the Cabin (1845); a compilation of short stories, one of which describes a loyal slave. Edgar Allan Poe thought the collection \\"decidedly the most American of American books\\".Widmer, Edward L. Young America: Flowering of Democracy in New York City. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 108. and declared Simms to be \\"immeasurably the greatest writer of fiction in America.\\"Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 164. In 1852, Simms published As Good as A Comedy; Or, The Tennessean‚Äôs Story. It and \\"Paddy McGann\\" (1867) constitute his two full- length works of Southern humor; he also wrote \\"Sharp Snaffles\\" and \\"Bill Bauldy,\\" two tall tales. He also wrote poetry and, in a letter to literary critic and poet Rufus Wilmot Griswold, Simms said that he was not interested in form as much as content, torn \\"between the desire to appear correct, and the greater desire to be original and true\\".Parks, Edd Winfield. Ante-Bellum Southern Literary Critics. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1962: 114. = Nonfiction history and biography = Simms' History of South Carolina (1842) served for several generations as the standard school textbook on the state's history. He also wrote The Social Principle: The True Source of National Permanence (1843) and several very popular biographies of Revolutionary War heroes Francis Marion, Nathanael Greene, and John Laurens, as well as John Smith and the Chevalier Bayard. Simms also wrote a history of Alabama, and was a popular lecturer on American history. He accumulated one of the largest collections of Revolutionary War manuscripts in the country. Most of this collection was lost when stragglers from Sherman's army burned his plantation home Woodlands near the Georgia border.Busick, Sean R. A Sober Desire for History: William Gilmore Simms as Historian., 2005. . = Pro- slavery writings = National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. Simms strongly supported slavery; in response to Uncle Tom's Cabin he wrote both negative reviews and a pro-slavery novel.\\"Woodcraft: Simms's First Answer to Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" by Joseph V.

Together they published numerous articles calling for moral reform of the South, including a stewardship role of masters in relation to slavery.Drew Gilpin Faust, A Sacred Circle: The Dilemma of the Intellectual in the Old South, 1840-1860, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1977 He strongly protested against Harriet Beecher Stowe's abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, in response to which he wrote reviews and a book. His Anti-Tom novel was The Sword and the Distaff. Even though The Sword and the Distaff was published only a few months after Stowe's novel, it contains several sections and discussions that are clearly debating Stowe's book and view of slavery. The novel focuses on the Revolutionary War and its aftermath through the lives of Captain Porgy and one of his slaves. Many of Simms's other writings took a similar pro-slavery viewpoint.\\"An Overview of Southern Literature by Genre\\" by Lucinda MacKethan, North Carolina State University, originally published in Southern Spaces, 2004, accessed Feb. 17, 2007. That book was among between twenty and thirty novels containing Anti-Tom elements published after Stowe's book in 1852. These novels tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended-family-style plantation. Simms' novel was popular enough that it was reprinted in 1854 under the title Woodcraft.\\"Caroline Lee Hentz's Long Journey\\" by Philip D. Beidler. Alabama Heritage, Number 75, Winter 2005. Accessed 2/7/2006. = American Civil War and final years = During the American Civil War, Simms espoused the side of the Secessionists in a weekly newspaper. Only his eldest son, who shared his name, was old enough to serve in the Confederate army and because of the common name, his identification as a volunteer or conscript private is unclear. Stragglers from Sherman's army burnt and destroyed Simms' plantation home \\"Woodlands\\" near the South Carolina border, along with 10,000 books and Revolutionary era manuscripts.Dowling, Linda, C. Charles Eliot Norton: The Art of Reform in Nineteenth-century America. New Hampshire, 2008:80- Other than for the backwoods novel \\"Paddy McGann\\" (1863), Simms published little after the Civil War began. He advised several southern politicians and made elaborate proposals for Confederate military defenses. During the war he wrote little of literary importance save the lively backwoods novel Paddy McGann (1863). His family impoverished by the war, Simms took on many writing and editing chores which ruined his health. He compiled an anthology of Southern war poems in 1866.Coulter, E. Merton. The South During Reconstruction, 1865‚Äì1877. Louisiana State University Press, 1947: 280. Death and legacy Simms died of cancer at his eldest daughter's home at 13 Society Street in Charleston on June 11, 1870. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery. A large bronze bust of Simms is centrally located in Charleston's Battery Park. The bust was sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward with a granite base designed by Edward Brickell White \\"The Simms Memorial\\". News and Courier. June 6, 1879. p. 4. The monument was dedicated in 1879. In 2016, the family had a ceremony honoring him in Hanahan, South Carolina. =Posthumous reputation= The Battery in Charleston, South Carolina Scholars at DocSouth note Simms's volume of work describes the historic and cultural diversity of the South, from the class hierarchy, sectional self- consciousness and agrarian economy of the Low Country; to both the violence and civilization of the Gulf South (which had both plantations and frontier); and the pioneering of the Appalachian Mountains.https://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/simms1/bio.html David Aiken, a founding member of the pro-secessionist group The League of the South, lamented that Simms was purged from the canon of American literature because of the \\"unpardonable sin Simms committed when he published an account of Columbia, South Carolina's destruction in which he dared to deny the North a righteous victory.\\"Aiken, David.

The University of South Carolina has digitized most of his works and papers, which have been digitized by the available as print on demand books. During recent years, a \\"Simms Renascence\\" has included scholars such as James E. Kibler, Mary Ann Wimsatt, Sean Busick, Charles S. Watson, and John C. Guilds. Kibler may be currently the leading authority on Simms's poetry; Guilds produced the major biography of the prolific author; Busick has concentrated on Simms's work as a historian; Wimsatt has published \\"The Major Fiction of William Gilmore Simms\\" as well as an edited version of his short stories, titled \\"Tales of the South\\" (a writer for \\"The Virginia Quarterly Review\\" calls Wimsatt's introduction to the tales \\"magisterial\\").

This is alternatively called the umbilical vesicle by the Terminologia Embryologica (TE), though yolk sac is far more widely used. In humans, the yolk sac is important in early embryonic blood supply, and much of it is incorporated into the primordial gut during the fourth week of development.The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Anatomy: Chapter 7 In humans Contents in the cavity of the uterus seen at approximately 5 weeks of gestational age by obstetric ultrasonography. Artificially colored, showing gestational sac, yolk sac and embryo (measuring 3 mm as the distance between the + signs). The yolk sac is the first element seen within the gestational sac during pregnancy, usually at 3 days gestation. The yolk sac is situated on the front (ventral) part of the embryo; it is lined by extra-embryonic endoderm, outside of which is a layer of extra- embryonic mesenchyme, derived from the epiblast. Blood is conveyed to the wall of the yolk sac by the primitive aorta and after circulating through a wide- meshed capillary plexus, is returned by the vitelline veins to the tubular heart of the embryo. This constitutes the vitelline circulation, which in humans serves as a location of haematopoiesis. Before the placenta is formed and can take over, the yolk sac provides nutrition and gas exchange between the mother and the developing embryo. At the end of the fourth week, the yolk sac presents the appearance of a small pear-shaped opening (traditionally called the umbilical vesicle), into the digestive tube by a long narrow tube, the vitelline duct. Rarely, the yolk sac can be seen in the afterbirth as a small, somewhat oval-shaped body whose diameter varies from 1 mm to 5 mm; it is situated between the amnion and the chorion and may lie on or at a varying distance from the placenta. There is no clinical significance to a residual external yolk sac.

Sometimes a narrowing of the lumen of the ileum is seen opposite the site of attachment of the duct. Histogenesis The yolk sac starts forming during the second week of the embryonic development, at the same time as the shaping of the amniotic sac. The hypoblast starts proliferating laterally and descending. In the meantime Heuser's membrane, located on the opposite pole of the developing vesicle, starts its upward proliferation and meets the hypoblast. Modifications *Primary yolk sac: it is the vesicle which develops in the second week, its floor is represented by Heuser's membrane and its ceiling by the hypoblast. It is also known as the exocoelomic cavity. *Secondary yolk sac: this structure is formed when the extraembryonic mesoderm separates to form the extraembryonic coelom; cells from the mesoderm pinch off an area of the yolk sac, and what remains is the secondary yolk sac. *The final yolk sac: during the fourth week of development, during organogenesis, part of the yolk sac is surrounded by endoderm and incorporated into the embryo as the gut. The remaining part of the yolk sac is the final yolk sac. Additional images File:Gray14.pngSurface view of embryo of Hylobates concolor. File:Gray17.pngHuman embryo‚Äîlength, 2 mm.

It is located on SH38 and is the terminus of the Murupara Railway Branch. The town's principal industries are all related to forestry. Murupara is in the rohe (tribal area) of the NgƒÅti Manawa iwi. The MƒÅori language name means \\"to wipe off mud\\". History and culture =History= Murupara was previously a staging post on the road between Rotorua and Napier. In the early 1900s, the planting of exotic trees began on the surrounding scrubland. This area is now known as the Kaingaroa Forest, with 1,400 square kilometres of planted pines. As the main service centre for the many forestry workers and their families, Murupara grew to a population of over 3,000. Recent changes to the forestry contracting system have brought about a decrease in the number of permanent residents. The settlements of Galatea, Horomanga, Kopuriki, Aniwhenua, Waiohau and Murupara lie between the boundary of the Kaingaroa Forest, the popular Te Urewera and Whirinaki Te Pua-a-TƒÅne Conservation Park.

While he is most famously remembered as the mentor of Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, Garc√≠a influenced several generations of musicians through his many years of teaching at the Toronto Conservatory of Music. Biography Born in La Serena, Chile, Garc√≠a first studied piano with his mother and older brother Daniel; he was otherwise self- taught. After the family moved to Santiago in the early 1890s, he became part of a group of artists and intellectuals who called themselves Los Diez. As a resourceful composer and talented concert pianist, Garc√≠a would have a reform- minded influence on Chilean musical life.Beckwith, John. \\"Alberto Guerrero.\\" Encyclopedia of Music in Canada. His brother Eduardo became a music critic and Alberto contributed articles and reviews to the newspaper El diario ilustrado. He published a treatise in 1915 entitled La armonia moderna (now lost). Garc√≠a introduced Chilean audiences to the modern music of his day, including works by Debussy, Ravel, Cyril Scott, Scriabin, and Schoenberg. He founded and conducted Santiago's first symphony orchestra and was active in founding the Sociedad Bach in 1917. In 1918, during a honeymoon trip to New York City, Garc√≠a came in contact with members of the Hambourg family, who invited him to teach at the recently established Hambourg Conservatory in Toronto. Garc√≠a accepted this position and emigrated to Canada with his wife and daughter the following year. In Toronto, Garc√≠a performed for a few years with the Hambourg Trio (having replaced pianist Mark Hambourg). While he shifted his focus to piano technique and pedagogy, he expanded his performing repertory to include works from Purcell through Les Six. As one of Canada's most active pianists, he played regular radio recitals (a highly innovative move at the time) beginning in the mid-1920s and through to the early 1950s. He also initiated a subscription series of solo recitals from 1932-1937. Each season's four or five recitals would cover often neglected works by Bach, Scarlatti, Haydn, Mozart, 18th-century Spanish composers, 20th-century French composers, and Stravinsky. Bach pieces included the complete inventions and sinfonias as well as the Goldberg Variations, all of which would be later popularized by his pupil Glenn Gould. Garc√≠a performed in various chamber ensembles with musicians such as with Frank Blachford (violin), Leo Smith (cello), Harold Sumberg (violin), and Cornelius Ysselstyn (cello). For over a decade, he was also a member of the Five Piano Ensemble. In 1922, Garc√≠a left the Hambourg Conservatory and joined the Toronto Conservatory of Music (Royal Conservatory of Music), where he remained until his death in Toronto in 1959, having established himself as one of Canada's preeminent music teachers. Garc√≠a was known to be quiet and focused. His near self-effacement instead gave rise to the most prominent Canadian musicians of the late 20th century. He had a decisive technical and aesthetic influence on Glenn Gould, whom he mentored for 10 years, even though Gould would later claim to be self-taught. Garc√≠a was also known for his keen intellect and eloquence vis-√†-vis painting, poetry, and philosophy (Comte, Husserl, Sartre). \\"He was one of the few musicians from whom a student would get a vista of ideas beyond music,\\" recalls composer R. Murray Schafer,Schafer, R. Murray (2007). Program Notes (PDF). who composed In Memoriam Alberto Guerrero a few months after his teacher's death. Compositions Garc√≠a had been known as a versatile composer in Santiago. In addition to a number of chamber works and piano solos, he wrote music for 4 or 5 operettas and zarzuelas (now lost) which were produced in Chile between 1908 and 1915. However, after moving to Canada, Garc√≠a focused more on teaching, though a couple of piano works (Tango and Southern Seas) were published in 1937. He also collaborated with his wife Myrtle Rose Guerrero to co-author The New Approach to the Piano (2 vols., 1935‚Äì36). Students Alberto Garc√≠a (standing) with his student Glenn Gould, Toronto ca 1947 As a prominent member of the music circles in Santiago and later at the Toronto Conservatory of Music, Garc√≠a influenced generations of students who would go on to shape the musical life of Chile, Canada, and beyond.

History and culture =MƒÅori history= In Maori legend, Whatonga, who came to New Zealand in search of his grandfather Toi, settled at Mahia. The peninsula is the tribal area of the NgƒÅti Rongomaiwahine iwi. The word mƒÅhia means \\"indistinct sound\\" or \\"scrofulous swelling\\". The name \\"Te MƒÅhia\\" comes from \\"Te MƒÅhia-mai-tawhiti\\" (the sound heard from a distance). Portland Island, also called Waikawa, is a small island off the southern tip of Mahia Peninsula. It was named Waikawa by Kahungunu when he visited there to look for fresh drinking water and only found salt water ‚Äì Waikawa means \\"sour water\\". Portland Island has an unmanned lighthouse. =European history= Shore whaling was briefly important on the Mahia Peninsula. Early whalers had a whaling station on the farm \\"Kini Kini\\", sheltered by \\"Long Point\\" on the west coast of the peninsula. The peninsula community these days is still generally a mix of Maori and European.

It also committed $102,644 to upgrading Tuahuru Marae, creating 4 jobs. Economy Mahia Beach in the morning Sheep and cattle farms are an important part for the local community, but tourism is now the peninsula's main industry. Mahia's population swells greatly during the warmer months and in particular during school holidays. Mahia is well known for its surf, scuba diving, hiking, and fishing. Morere Hot Springs is 15 minutes away, towards Gisborne. The area is a popular school holiday destination and contains a holiday park dating back to the 1960s.

Part of the lake-burst stories may originate in sudden hydrographic changes around limestone-based inland plains or turloughs. Other so-called lake-bursts refer to marine estuaries, bays and inlets, such as Galway Bay, Strangford Lough, Dundrum Bay, Belfast Lough, Waterford Harbour and the mouth of the River Erne. Some of these coastal districts were renowned for the drowned prehistoric forests, which gave rise to several flood-myths. Medieval bards had a special genre of lake-burst poems called tomamond. More or less elaborate 11th- or 12th-century narratives have survived around Galway Bay, Lough Neagh and Lough Ree, which seem to be related to similar (though less ancient) stories in Wales (Cantre'r Gwaelod, Llys Helig, Bala Lake, Llynclys), Cornwall (Lyonesse), Brittany (Ys) and Normandy (For√™t de Scissy). A late 16th-century Frisian legend, probably borrowed from Irish examples, refers to the origins of the Zuiderzee. Other Irish texts refer to the eruption of the River Boyne and other rivers. The poems of the lake-burst of Lough Erne and the eruption of Br√≠ (where the legendary character Midir lived) have been lost. In Wales the flood-myth is elaborated in the story of Dwyfan and Dwyfach, who saved people and animals from the great deluge caused by the monster Avanc living in Llyn Llion (possibly Bala Lake). Its Irish counterpart as told in the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn only links up with the Biblical story of Noah's flood. The theme relates to the classical story of the warrior Marcus Curtius, who was said to have thrown himself in the Lacus Curtius near the Forum Romanum in order to stop a chasm made by the river Tiber. A similar story was told about King Midas.Plutarch, Moralia: Greek and Roman Parallel Stories Identification Not every lake mentioned in medieval sources can be identified with certainty.Most identifications after John O'Donovan (ed.), Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, by the Four Masters, from the Earliest Period to the Year 1616, 2nd. ed., vol. 1, Dublin 1856. Loch Lainglinne, for instance, might be another reference to Belfast Lough, which was known as Loch Laoigh or Loch Laigh. Apparently, medieval Irishmen were convinced that almost all of their lakes had emerged after Noah's flood. Their myths suggest that land reclamation and deforestation went hand in hand with the seasonal inundation of low-lying plains. According to the corrupted text of Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn king Parthol√≥n found only three lakes or bays: Loch Fordremain in Sliab Mis of Mumhan (Tralee Bay), Loch Lumnig (probably Loch Lurgan or Galway Bay) on Tir Find and Loch Cera or Findloch over the borders of Irrus. Interestingly enough, several major lakes and outlets, such as Lough Corrib, Lough Derg (Shannon), Shannon Estuary and Killary Harbour are not mentioned in any known myth. This may imply that at least some lake-bursts mentioned have been wrongly identified with smaller lakes, where, in fact, they were referring to one of the major lakes. Lough Derg (Ulster), moreover, was identified in the Life of Saint Patrick as the location of Purgatory.

October 31, 1980), born Sen Yew Cheung, was an American character actor, best known for playing Jimmy Chan in the Charlie Chan films and Hop Sing in the western series Bonanza. He was born in San Francisco, California to Gum Yung Sen and his first wife, both immigrants from China.His father's name is given in the dedication to the Great Wok Cookbook. When his mother died during the flu epidemic of 1919, his father placed Victor and his younger sister, Rosemary, in a children's shelter, and returned to his homeland to seek another wife. He returned in 1922 with his new wife, Lovi Shee, once again forming a household with his two children.United States Census, 1930, Household of Gum Young Sen, San Francisco (Districts 251-409), San Francisco, California. NARA Publication: T626, roll 209; Enumeration District Number: 0393; Family Number: 584; Sheet Number and Letter: 30B; Line Number: 59 During his acting career, Victor was given billing under a variety of names, including Sen Yung, Sen Young, Victor Sen Young, and Victor Young. Career Sen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1938 film Charlie Chan in Honolulu, as the Chinese detective's \\"number two son,\\" Jimmy Chan. In this movie, Sidney Toler replaced the recently deceased Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and Sen Yung replaced Oland's \\"number one son\\" Lee, who had been played by Keye Luke. Sen Yung played Jimmy Chan in 10 Charlie Chan films between 1938 and 1942. He played the crucial role of lawyer's clerk Ong Chi Seng alongside Bette Davis in The Letter (1940). In common with other Chinese- American actors, Sen Yung was cast in Japanese parts during World War II, such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 Humphrey Bogart film Across the Pacific. During World War II, he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces. During his military service, he was replaced in the Charlie Chan series by Benson Fong, who played \\"number three son\\", Tommy Chan. Yung's military service included work in training films at the First Motion Picture Unit and a role in the Army Air Forces' play and film Winged Victory.San Antonio Light, September 29, 1944, p. 8-C After the war, Sen Yung resumed his Hollywood career. The Charlie Chan series was now in the hands of Monogram Pictures, with Sidney Toler continuing in the leading role. Toler's health was failing by 1946; Monogram was conserving Toler's waning energy and shooting around him wherever possible, even reusing two-year-old footage of Toler to finish Toler's last film. To relieve the burden on Toler, Monogram hired his original screen foil, Sen Yung (now billing himself as Victor Sen Young). He and Mantan Moreland shared much of the footage in Toler's final three films, Dangerous Money, Shadows over Chinatown, and The Trap. Following Toler's death in 1947, Victor Sen Young appeared in five of the remaining six Charlie Chan features. His character \\"Jimmy\\" was renamed \\"Tommy\\" (author Scott MacGillivray contends that \\"Jimmy\\" was so closely associated with Sidney Toler that audiences would miss seeing Toler opposite him, resulting in Monogram making the change). Victor Sen Young continued to work in motion pictures and television, playing affable or earnest Asian characters. He is probably best remembered as Hop Sing, the cook on the long-running television series Bonanza, appearing in 102 episodes between 1959 and 1973. Sen Yung was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner Quong Kee in Tombstone, Arizona, in the 1957 episode, \\"Quong Kee\\", of the syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story, an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother (played by Mary Newton) with the saloon musician Ann Bailey (Eugenia Paul), who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs. Art Gresham. In the early 1970s, Sen Yung had a recurring role in seven episodes of the tv series Kung Fu, which starred David Carradine as a Shaolin monk, also in the Old West. Sen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef. He frequently appeared on cooking programs, and authored The Great Wok Cookbook in 1974. Plane hijacking In 1972, Yung was on Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 710, which was hijacked. The FBI stormed the plane, and in the ensuing gunfire Sen Yung was shot in the lower back. He and another wounded passenger survived, but a third passenger and the two hijackers were killed.Ada Evening News, July 6, 1972, p. 1 In 1975, he appeared on Garry Moore's To Tell The Truth and related the events of the hijacking. With Yung dressed in a sport coat and flanked by two dissimilar imposters, none of the four panelists was able to choose him as the character actor. Death and legacy Sen Yung died in his North Hollywood home in 1980. The actor, who ran a small mail-order Chinese pottery business, was creating clayware and curing the items with an oven, and died of natural gas poisoning from a gas leak. His body was found November 9, but he had reportedly been dead at least ten days, from possibly around October 31. Some reports suggested that the actor was murdered,Valley Independent, November 11, 1980, page 8 but police ultimately ruled the death accidental.Indiana (Pennsylvania) Gazette, November 10, 1980, page 4 The eulogy at Sen Yung's funeral was given by fellow Bonanza actor Pernell Roberts, who also paid the funeral expenses. The Victor Sen Yung memorial scholarship is awarded each year by the Chinese Alumni Association of the University of California, Berkeley, where Sen Yung majored in animal husbandry.

The isthmus separates the waters of Chignecto Bay, a sub-basin of the Bay of Fundy, from those of Baie Verte, a sub-basin of the Northumberland Strait that is an arm of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The isthmus stretches from its northerly point at an area in the Petitcodiac River valley near the city of Dieppe, New Brunswick to its southerly point at an area near the town of Amherst, Nova Scotia. At its narrowest point between Amherst and Tidnish, the isthmus measures 24 kilometres wide. Because of its strategic position, it has been important to competing forces through much of its history of occupation. The name \\"Chignecto\\" derives from the Mi'kmaq name Siknikt, meaning \\"drainage place\\"; the name of the Mi'kmaq District where the isthmus is located. Geography The majority of the lands comprising the isthmus have low elevation above sea level; a large portion comprises the Tantramar Marshes, as well as tidal rivers, mud flats, inland freshwater marshes, coastal saltwater marshes, and mixed forest. Several prominent ridges rise above the surrounding low land and marshes along the Bay of Fundy shore, namely the Fort Lawrence Ridge (in Nova Scotia), the Aulac Ridge, the Sackville Ridge, and the Memramcook Ridge (in New Brunswick). In contrast to the Bay of Fundy shoreline in the west, the Northumberland Strait shoreline in the east is largely forested, with serpentine tidal estuaries such as the Tidnish River penetrating inland. The narrowest point on the Northumberland shoreline is opposite the Cumberland Basin at Baie Verte. If sea levels were to rise by 12 meters, the isthmus would be flooded, effectively making mainland Nova Scotia an island. Transportation As the Isthmus of Chignecto was a key surface transportation route since the 17th century, French and later British colonists built military roads across it to the Tantramar Marshes and along the strategic ridges. In 1872, the Intercolonial Railway of Canada constructed a mainline between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick across the southern portion of the isthmus. It skirted the edge of the Bay of Fundy while crossing the Tantramar Marshes between Amherst, Nova Scotia and Sackville, New Brunswick. In 1886 a railway line was built from Sackville across the isthmus to Port Elgin and on to Cape Tormentine. The latter was a port for the iceboat service. In 1917 Canadian National Railways established a rail ferry service to Prince Edward Island to connect with the Prince Edward Island Railway. In the mid-1880s, the isthmus was also the site of one of Canada's earliest mega- projects: construction of a broad-gauge railway from the port of Amherst to the Northumberland Strait at Tidnish for carrying small cargo and passenger ships. This ship railway was never successfully operational, and construction was abandoned shortly before completion.Chignecto Ship Railway, Library of University of New Brunswick In the 1950s, while construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway was underway, a group of industrialists and politicians from the Maritimes called for a Chignecto Canal to be built as a shortcut for ocean-going ships travelling between Saint John and U.S. ports to the Great Lakes to avoid travelling around Nova Scotia. The project, while endorsed by the both the second Flemming government of New Brunswick and the Robichaud government that succeeded it, never progressed beyond the survey stage. In the early 1960s, the Trans-Canada Highway was built on the isthmus to connect with Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Route 2 in New Brunswick and Highway 104 in Nova Scotia were built parallel to the existing Canadian National Railway trackage; this inter-provincial highway was upgraded to a 4-lane expressway in the 1990s. Route 16 in New Brunswick was built from an interchange with Route 2 in Aulac to the ferry terminal at Cape Tormentine. This was subsequently modified in 1997 to connect with the Confederation Bridge at Cape Jourimain. History The first European settlements on the isthmus were French. The isthmus was the location of a growing Acadian farming community called Beaubassin. The isthmus became in 1713 the site of the historic dividing line between the British colony of Nova Scotia and the French territory. French military forces established Fort Beaus√©jour on the Aulac Ridge in 1749 in response to the British construction of an outpost called Fort Lawrence on the ridge immediately to the east. Between the two ridges was a tidal stream called the Missaquash River, which France generally accepted to be the boundary between the territories. The powers had never determined and agreed to an official boundary. France also constructed Fort Gaspereau on the shores of the Northumberland Strait to effectively control travel on the isthmus. = King William's War = Benjamin Church: Father of American ranging ; Raid on Chignecto (1696) During King William's War, the first of the four French and Indian Wars, the English colonial militia leader Benjamin Church led a devastating raid on the Isthmus of Chignecto at Beaubassin, in retaliation for an earlier French and native raid against Pemaquid, Maine (present day Bristol, Maine) earlier that year. Church and four hundred men (50 to 150 of whom were Indians, likely Iroquois) arrived offshore of Beaubassin on September 20. They managed to get ashore and surprise the Acadians. Many fled while one confronted Church with papers showing they had signed an oath of allegiance in 1690 to the English king. Church was unconvinced. He burned a number of buildings, killed inhabitants, looted their household goods, and slaughtered their livestock. Governor Villebon reported that > \\"the English stayed at Beaubassin nine whole days without drawing any > supplies from their vessels, and even those settlers to whom they had shown > a pretence of mercy were left with empty houses and barns and nothing else > except the clothes on their backs.\\" = Queen Anne's War = ; Raid on Chignecto (1704) Major Church returned to Acadia during Queen Anne's War, in retaliation for the French and their Abenaki allies' sorties during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703) and the Raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts. They killed many English colonists at Deerfield and took more than 100 captive. The captives were mostly women and children; they were forced on an overland march from western Massachusetts to Montreal. Some were held by the Indians for ransom, as raiding was active on both sides. Others were adopted by Mohawk families at the Catholic village south of the French city. Some adults, such as the minister of Deerfield, were redeemed by their communities or families paying ransom, but the process sometimes took years. His daughter Emily, adopted when a young teenager, never returned to live with her English family, as she married a Mohawk man and had a family with him. On July 17, 1704 Church raided Chignecto. The Acadian settlers returned some gunfire but quickly sought shelter in the woods. Church burned 40 empty houses and killed more than 200 cattle and other livestock.THE BOSTON NEWS-LETTER, AUGUST 7, 1704, as recorded in \\"An historical digest of the provincial press; being a collation of all items of personal and historic reference relating to American affairs printed in the newspapers of the provincial period beginning with the appearance of The present state of the New-English affairs, 1689, Publick occurrences, 1690, and the first issue of the Boston news-letter, 1704, and ending with the close of the revolution, 1783\\", p. 112 (See Boston News Letter) On this campaign against Acadia, Church also raided Castine, Maine, Grand Pr√©, and Pisiguit (present-day Windsor/Falmouth). The British took control of present-day mainland Nova Scotia under the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), and Beaubassin became part of British territory. = King George's War = During King George's War, the French used Chignecto as the staging area for their raids on British Nova Scotia. It was the gathering place for De Ramezay prior to the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744).Hand, p. 14 Chignecto was also the base of Coulon de Valliers prior to the Battle of Grand Pre (1747). = Father Le Loutre's War = ; Battle at Chignecto (1749) During Father Le Loutre's War, conflict in Acadia continued. On September 18, 1749, several Mi'kmaq and Maliseet killed three Englishmen at Chignecto. Seven natives were also killed in the skirmish.Grenier, p. 149 ; Battle at Chignecto (1750) In May 1750, Lawrence was unsuccessful in getting a base at Chignecto because Le Loutre burned the village of Beaubassin, preventing Lawrence from using its supplies to establish a fort. (According to the historian Frank Patterson, the Acadians at Cobequid also burned their homes as they retreated from the British to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia in 1754.Frank Harris Patterson. History of Tatamagouche, Halifax: Royal Print & Litho., 1917 (also Mika, Belleville: 1973), p. 19) Lawrence retreated, but he returned in September 1750. On September 3, Rous, Lawrence and Gorham led over 700 men to Chignecto, where Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians opposed their landing. They killed twenty British, who in turn killed several Mi‚Äôkmaq. Le Loutre's militia eventually withdrew, burning the rest of the Acadians' crops and houses as they went.Grenier, p. 159 Le Loutre and the Acadian militia leader Joseph Broussard resisted the British assault. The British troops defeated the resistance and began construction of Fort Lawrence near the site of the ruins of Beaubassin.Hand, p. 20 The work on the fort proceeded rapidly and they completed the facility within weeks. To limit the British to peninsular Nova Scotia, the French also began to fortify the Chignecto and its approaches; they constructed Fort Beaus√©jour and two satellite forts: one at present-day Port Elgin, New Brunswick (Fort Gaspareaux) and the other at present-day Saint John, New Brunswick (Fort Menagoueche).Hand, p. 25 During these months, 35 Mi'kmaq and Acadians ambushed Ranger Captain Francis Bartelo, killing him and six of his men while taking seven others captive. The Mi'kmaq conducted ritual torture of the captives throughout the night, which had a chilling effect on the New Englanders. ; Raid on Chignecto (1751) The British retaliated for the Raid on Dartmouth (1751) by sending several armed companies to Chignecto. They killed a few French defenders and breached the dikes, allowing the low lands to flood. Hundreds of acres of crops were ruined, which was disastrous for the Acadians and the French troops.Faragher, p. 272 In the summer of 1752, Father Le Loutre went to Quebec and then on to France to raise funds and supplies to re-build the dikes. He returned in the spring of 1753. In May 1753, Natives scalped two British soldiers at Fort Lawrence. = Seven Years' War = ; Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour (1755) Map of Chignecto (1755) A British fleet of three warships and thirty-three transports, carrying 2,100 soldiers from Boston, Massachusetts, landed at Fort Lawrence on June 3, 1755. They attacked Fort Beaus√©jour the following day. The French forces abandoned Fort Gaspareaux on June 16, 1755, choosing instead to re-garrison at Fortress Louisbourg. This battle proved to be one of the key victories for the British in the Seven Years' War, in which Great Britain gained control of all of New France and Acadia. On the isthmus, the British abandoned Fort Lawrence and took over the better-constructed Fort Beaus√©jour, which they renamed Fort Cumberland. Shortly afterwards, the Great Upheaval began when British forces started rounding up French settlers during the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). Most of these settlers would be deported, with their villages burned behind them to prevent their return. ; Skirmish at Chignecto (1755 July) During the Seven Years' War, at Fort Moncton (formerly Fort Gaspareaux), one of Captain Silvaus Cobb's soldiers was shot from his horse and killed in an ambush. Cobb assembled 100 troops but was unable to catch the Mi‚Äôkmaq. Monckton dispatched 200 men from Fort Lawrence but was also unsuccessful in catching any Mi‚Äôkmaq.Grenier, p. 179 ; Raid on Chignecto (1755 September) Marquis de Boish√©bert - Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot (1753) On September 15, Majors Jedediah Preblehttps://archive.org/stream/genealogicalsket00preb#page/n69/mode/2up and Benjamin Coldthwait took 400 men to destroy an Acadian village a short distance outside of Fort Monckton.Grenier, p. 183. ; Raid on Chignecto (1756 January) British Gravestones from the Mi'kmaw Raid on Fort Monckton (1756) - oldest known gravestones in the Maritimes On January 20, Boish√©bert sent Fran√ßois Boucher de Niverville to Baie Verte to burn a British schooner. Niverville killed seven soldiers and took one prisoner before burning the ship. Meanwhile, Boish√©bert and his 120 Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq tried to set up a siege of Fort Cumberland, but ended up escaping capture in a possible ambush.Grenier, p. 186-187. ; Raid on Chignecto (1756 April) The Mi'kmaq and Acadians attacked Fort Cumberland on April 26, 1756.

Colonel Hunt Walsh to take the 28th regiment and a company of rangers to Baie Verte to burn what was left of it. When they arrived, it was already vacated.Grenier, p. 191.  Yorkshire emigration  In 1758 Governor Lawrence issued a proclamation inviting New Englanders to come to Nova Scotia, settle on vacated Acadian lands, and take up free land grants. He also extended the invitation to New England soldiers serving in Canada whose enlistments had expired and who were planning on returning home. Such settlers became known as the New England Planters. Following the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the British created three 100,000-acre (400 km¬≤) townships on the isthmus: Amherst, Sackville and Cumberland, which would later be dissolved into Cumberland County. The drive to attract settlers from New England was not immediately successful. After a few small groups arrived in 1760 and 1761, some families returned home, and the British government decided to look elsewhere for settlers. Between 1772 and 1775, more than 20 ships arrived from England, carrying upwards of 1,000 settlers from Yorkshire to the new townships. The descendants of the Yorkshire emigration continue to be prominent in the area's development and history. = American Revolutionary War = ;Battle of Fort Cumberland (\\"Eddy Rebellion\\") In October and November 1776, local guerrilla and colonial American forces led by Jonathan Eddy and John Allan attempted to take over Fort Cumberland and the Tantramar region. Eddy's attacking force consisted of \\"about twenty\\" Americans from Machias, Maine, 27 Yankee settlers from the Saint John River valley, 140 Malisseet and four Mi'kmaq, 21 Acadians from the Memramcook Valley and the Allen family farm, and about 120 farmers from Cumberland, Onslow, and Pictou.Ernest Clarke, The siege of Fort Cumberland, 1776, McGill Queen's University Press, 1995. pp. 215- Eddy had insufficient forces to capture the fort in a direct assault so he besieged the fort instead. Rebel sympathizers from Sackville burned some surrounding buildings. After three weeks, British forces dispatched from Halifax and Windsor routed the invaders. The British burned eight of the rebel Acadians' houses and barns at Inverma Farm, Jolicoeur. With winter coming rapidly, the Acadians were forced to relocate with their families to Memramcook.R√©gis Brun, De Grand Pr√© √† Kouchibougouac, √âditions d'Acadie, Moncton, 1982, p. 59-60 Eddy, Allan and many of the other English-speaking rebels were also expelled from Nova Scotia, but the American colonial government rewarded their efforts with land grants in Maine and Ohio.

It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1985\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved March 27, 2012. (With essays by Courtney Eldridge, Matthew Pitt, and Jess Walter from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) White Noise is an example of postmodern literature. It is widely considered DeLillo's \\"breakout\\" work and brought him to the attention of a much larger audience. Time included the novel in its list of \\"Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\\". DeLillo originally wanted to call the book Panasonic, but the Panasonic Corporation objected. Plot Set at a bucolic mid-western college known only as The-College-on-the-Hill, White Noise follows a year in the life of Jack Gladney, a professor who has made his name by pioneering the field of Hitler studies (though he has not taken German lessons until this year). He has been married five times to four women and rears a brood of children and stepchildren (Heinrich, Denise, Steffie, Wilder) with his current wife, Babette. Jack and Babette are both extremely afraid of death; they frequently wonder which of them will be the first to die. The first part of White Noise, called \\"Waves and Radiation\\", is a chronicle of contemporary family life combined with academic satire. There is little plot development in this first section, which mainly serves as an introduction to the characters and themes which dominate the rest of the book. For instance, the mysterious deaths of men in \\"Mylex\\" (intended to suggest Mylar) suits and the ashen, shaken survivors of a plane that went into free fall anticipate the catastrophe of the book's second part. \\"Waves and Radiation\\" also introduces Murray Jay Siskind, Jack's friend and fellow college professor, who discusses theories about death, supermarkets, media, \\"psychic data,\\" and other facets of contemporary American culture. In the second part, \\"The Airborne Toxic Event\\", a chemical spill from a rail car releases a black noxious cloud over Jack's home region, prompting an evacuation. Frightened by his exposure to the toxin (called Nyodene Derivative) Jack is forced to confront his mortality. An organization called SIMUVAC (short for \\"simulated evacuation\\") is also introduced in Part Two, an indication of simulations replacing reality. In part three of the book, \\"Dylarama\\", Jack discovers that Babette has been cheating on him with a man she calls \\"Mr. Gray\\" in order to gain access to a fictional drug called Dylar, an experimental treatment for the terror of death. The novel becomes a meditation on modern society's fear of death and its obsession with chemical cures as Jack seeks to obtain his own black-market supply of Dylar. However, Dylar does not work for Babette, and it has many possible side effects, including losing the ability to \\"distinguish words from things, so that if someone said 'speeding bullet', I would fall to the floor and take cover\\".p. 193, original Penguin paperback edition. Jack continues to obsess over death. During a discussion about mortality, Murray suggests that killing someone could alleviate the fear. Jack decides to track down and kill Mr. Gray, whose real name, he has learned, is Willie Mink. After a black comedy scene of Jack driving and rehearsing, in his head, several ways in which their encounter might proceed, he successfully locates and shoots Willie, who at the time is in a delirious state caused by his own Dylar addiction. Jack puts the gun in Willie's hand to make the murder look like a suicide, but Willie then shoots Jack in the arm. Suddenly realizing the needless loss of life, Jack carries Willie to a hospital run by German nuns who do not believe in God or an afterlife. Having saved Willie, Jack returns home to watch his children sleep. The final chapter describes Wilder, Jack's youngest child, riding a tricycle across the highway and miraculously surviving. Characters Jack Gladney is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. He is a professor of Hitler studies at a liberal arts college in middle America. Babette is Jack's wife. They have six children from previous marriages, and they are currently living with four of these children. Babette has an affair with Willie Mink, aka Mr. Gray, in order to obtain Dylar. Heinrich Gerhardt is the fourteen-year-old son of Jack and Janet Savory. He is precociously intellectual, prone to be contrary, and plays correspondence chess with an imprisoned mass murderer. Dana Breedlove is Jack's first and fourth wife and the mother of Mary Alice and Steffie. She works part time for the CIA and conducts covert drop-offs in Latin America. She also writes book reviews. Bee is the twelve-year-old daughter of Jack and Tweedy Browner. She lived in South Korea for two years. Tweedy Browner is Jack's third wife and the mother of Bee. Denise is the eleven-year-old daughter of Babette and Bob Pardee. She suspects her mother is a drug addict and steals the bottle of Dylar to hide it. Steffie is the nine-year-old daughter of Jack and Dana Breedlove. Wilder is Babette's two-year-old son, and the youngest child in the family. Wilder is never quoted for dialogue in the novel (however, at one point, it is said that he asked for a glass of milk), and periodically Jack worries about the boy's slow linguistic development. Mary Alice is the nineteen-year-old daughter of Dana Breedlove and Jack's first marriage. Murray Jay Siskind is a colleague of Jack's. He wants to create a field of study centered on Elvis Presley in the same way that Jack has created one around Hitler. He teaches a course on the cinema of car crashes, watches TV obsessively, and cheerfully theorizes about many subjects, including media saturation, mindfulness, and the meaning of supermarkets. Orest Mercator is Heinrich's friend who trains to sit in a cage with vipers. Vernon Dickey is Babette's father who visits the family in chapter 33 and gives Jack a gun. Willie Mink is a compromised researcher who invents Dylar. Winnie Richards is a scientist at the college where Jack works, to whom Jack goes for information about Dylar. Janet Savory is Jack's second wife and the mother of Heinrich. She manages the financial businesses of an ashram in Montana, where she is known as Mother Devi. Before that she worked as a foreign-currency analyst for a secret group of advanced theorists. Analysis White Noise explores several themes that emerged during the mid-to-late twentieth century, e.g., rampant consumerism, media saturation, novelty academic intellectualism, underground conspiracies, the disintegration and reintegration of the family, human-made disasters, and the potentially regenerative nature of violence. The novel's style is characterized by a heterogeneity that utilizes \\"montages of tones, styles, and voices that have the effect of yoking together terror and wild humor as the essential tone of contemporary America\\".Lentricchia, Frank (ed.). New Essays on White Noise. Cambridge; New York: CUP, 1991. =Academia= The novel is an example of academic satire, where the shortcomings of academia are ridiculed through irony or sarcasm. Critic Karen Weekes notes that the professors at University-on-the-Hill \\"fail to inspire respect\\" from their students and that \\"the university itself is 'trivialized by the nostalgic study of popular and youth cultureWeekes, Karen. \\"Consuming and Dying: Meaning and the Marketplace in Don DeLillo's White Noise.\\" Lit: Literature Interpretation Theory 18.4 (2007): 285‚Äì302. Web. by offering classes on Adolf Hitler, Elvis Presley, and cinematic car crashes. Critic Ian Finseth adds how \\"the academic profession ...[has a] tendency to divide up the world and all human experience\\".Finseth, Ian. \\"White Noise by Don DeLillo.\\" NoveList. EBSCO/NoveList, 2001. Web. 21 Apr.2016. DeLillo uses \\"Hitler Studies\\" as a way the characters can deal with complex information and enabling them to cope with the intricacy of their society. Critic Stephen Schryer goes on to note the satirical way that characters in White Noise \\"lay claim to specialized knowledge that can be transmitted to others, regardless of his or her educational accomplishments or actual income\\". According to Schryer, the characters' vocations suggest \\"pseudo-professionalism\\", as if each can claim a professional expertise or outstanding intellect that \\"[renders] this class dependent on hyper-specialized forms of expertise\\". Critic David Alworth suggests that characters deal with unknowns like death via the \\"pseudo-professional\\"; they respond by pretending that they are educated to understand it. =Consumer culture= Ecocritic Cynthia Deitering has described the novel as central to the rise of \\"toxic consciousness\\" in American fiction in the 1980s, arguing that the novel \\"offers insight into a culture's shifting relation to nature and to the environment at a time when the imminence of ecological collapse was, and is, part of the public mind and of individual imagination\\".Deitering, Cynthia. 'The Postnatural Novel: Toxic Consciousness in Fiction of the 1980s.' The Ecocriticism Reader. Ed. Cheryll Glotfelty and Harold Fromm. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1996. p.196-7 DeLillo critiques modern consumption by connecting identity to shopping in White Noise. In a 1993 interview, DeLillo states that there is a \\"consume or die\\" mentality in America, which is reflected in the novel. Characters in the novel try to avoid death through shopping. For example, Jack goes on a shopping spree where he is described as feeling more powerful with each purchase: \\"I traded money for goods. The more money I spent, the less important it seemed. I was bigger than these sums.\\" Postmodern critic Karen Weekes expands on this idea and argues that Americans \\"consume and die\\"; Even though Jack tries to avoid death through shopping, he can't. Life is represented by shopping and death is represented by checking out at the registers. Critic Ahmad Ghashmari addresses the connection between advertising's influence on shoppers and the world in White Noise by stating, \\"shoppers are attracted to colors, sizes, and the packaging; the surface is what draws and grips their attentions and ignites their desires to buy items regardless of their need for them\\". According to Ghashmari, \\"the supermarket, with its spectacle of goods has effaced reality and replaced it with a hyper reality in which the surfaces replace the real products\\". Additionally, critic Ruzbeh Babaee argues that in the novel, \\"there is a belief in the produced through media advertising, that one can shop his/her way out of any personal trauma. When shopping, people may define an identity, an idea of who they are.\\" The characters in White Noise shop in order to create their own identity and escape the fear of death. On the topic of consumerism, DeLillo himself states that \\"through products and advertising people attain an impersonal identity.\\" In other words, because shoppers all buy the same products, they can't be unique. Through the theme of technology, DeLillo demonstrates the effect media has on human behavior. Most critics agree that White Noise functions as a cautionary tale about high-tech America by focusing on the effects of technology on social relations. Critic Ahmad Ghashmari says, \\"TV is as important and influential as the protagonist of the novel‚Ä¶ TV seems to control all people; they believe nothing but TV.\\" He points to chapter 6 of the novel, explaining, \\"Heinrich refuses to trust his senses in observing the weather and chooses to believe the radio instead. He believes that all what is broadcast on the radio is true.\\" One critic adds that television does not stop at molding the thoughts of DeLillo's characters, but more invasively, television and its advertising subliminally shape their unconscious behavior. For example, in chapter 21, Jack witnesses television's influence when he observes his daughter uttering Toyota Celica in her sleep. DeLillo has said that \\"there's a connection between the advances that are made in technology and the sense of primitive fear people develop in response to it\\". Critic John Frow connects the theme of technology to the greater postmodern theoretical issues the book addresses. He suggests that a second televised narrative is embedded within the narrative of the novel's plot through constant references to television's interjections. The world of White Noise so saturated by television shows and other media messages that \\"it becomes increasingly difficult to separate primary actions from imitations of actions.\\" Thoughts and actions are replaced by programmed responses, which have been learned. Indeed, it is a world that seems determined by simulation which, according to Jean Baudrillard, is \\"the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.‚Äù This is illustrated by much of the imagery used to convey the incomprehensible reality of the Toxic Cloud and is explicitly thematized through Jack's conversation with the intake clerk from SIMUVAC which concludes Part 2 of the novel. Here Jack is told that even though the evacuation taking place is real, the SIMUVAC team is treating it \\"as a model\\" to be used to perfect the protocol they will use in future disaster simulations. In effect, the reality of \\"The Airborne Toxic Event\\" has been displaced by their performance in something like street theater. Such an ironic reversal of reader expectations is reinforced when the Simuvac Man further acknowledges that using \\"the real event in order to rehearse the simulation\\" has inherent difficulties and that You have to make allowances for the fact that everything we see tonight is real.\\" In Baudrillard's words, \\"It is no longer a question of imitation, nor of reduplication, nor even of parody. It is rather a question of substituting signs of the real for the real itself.\\" That is why the Simuvac Man concludes his remarks by conceding that \\"There's a lot of polishing we still have to do. But that's what this exercise is all about.\\" Such a substitution of the sign for the reality is what Baudrillard calls a simulacrum, and in White Noise this is emblematically represented by \\"the most photographed barn in America\\" which, according to Peter Knight, \\"has perhaps become the 'Most Discussed Scene in Postmodern Fiction'.\\"Knight, Peter (2008). \\"Delillo, Postmodernism, Postmodernity\\". In Duvall, John N. (ed.). The Cambridge Companion to Don DeLillo. Cambridge University Press. . Such a Postmodern understanding is expressed by Murray when he declares that \\"No one sees the barn,\\" for \\"Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.\\" Created by photography and tourism, the barn is \\"a packaged perception, a ‚Äòsight‚Äô...not a ‚Äòthing‚Äô.\\"Lentricchia, Frank (1989). \\"Don DeLillo's Primal Scenes.\\" In Osteen, Mark (ed.). White Noise: Text and Criticism. Viking Critical Library (1998). . p. 416 Because as Murray explains \\"we've read the signs, seen the people snapping the pictures,\\" the barn is a cultural reality which has what Delillo calls an \\"aura.\\" This aura, says Murray, prevents us from even speculating about what the \\"original\\" barn might have really been like because \\"We can't get outside the aura,\\" and every photograph taken by the tourists only \\"reinforces the aura\\" of the barn. According to Frank Lentricchia, this loss of the referent, the dissolving of the object into its representations, lends the passage the status of a \\"primal scene,\\" but one which is for Murray an occasion for celebration because it is a \\"technological transcendence\\" and \\"We're part of the aura. We're here, we're now.\\" =Childhood= DeLillo also portrays the children as being smarter and more mature than the adults in the White Noise. In a 1985 book review of the novel by Jayne Anne Phillips from The New York Times, Phillips says \\"Children, in the America of White Noise, are in general, more competent, more watchful, more in sync than their parents\\". These children have the composure normally expected of an adult, yet the parents have a constant sense of self-doubt that makes them appear immature and paranoid. A scholar from University of Washington, Tom Leclaire, adds to the argument by saying that children are the center of knowledge: \\"Gladney's children are making his family a center of learning\\". However, Joshua Little, of Georgia State University, provides a different point of view that \\"the possibility of transcendence through the innocence of children is hinted at in the novel\\". According to Little, in the context of the turn of the century, knowledge is connected to having a higher social standing. Adina Baya, a specialist in media communication, supports this idea as she points out that children during the 1980s had greater access to mass media and marketing than before. =Religion= DeLillo interprets religion in White Noise unconventionally, most notably drawing comparisons between the Jack's local supermarket and a religious institution on several occasions. Critic Karen Weekes argues that religion in White Noise has \\"lost its quality\\" and that it is a \\"devaluation\\" of traditional belief in a superhuman power. According to critic Tim Engles, DeLillo portrays protagonist Jack Gladney as \\"formulating his own prayers and seeking no solace from higher authority\\". In addition, in the places the reader would expect to see religion, it is absent. Novelist and critic Joshua Ferris points out that \\"in a town like Blacksmith, the small mid-western university town of White Noise, the rites and rituals of traditional religion, such as church, bible study, and signs for Jesus, are expected\\". However, God is largely absent in this suburb. He adds \\"the absence of religion is obvious, and places the novel in an entirely non-spiritual, post-Christian world. In White Noise, not even Catholic nuns believe in God.\\" However, Professor Majeed Jadwe countered with, \\"White Noise begins and ends with a ritual. The first is the convoy of station wagons arriving for the new school year, which Jack describes as an event which he has not missed in 21 years. It ends with the public ritual of self-hood perfection.\\" Professor Jadwe implies that although religion is not presented in the book, the concept of ritual is still present. The society portrayed in White Noise utilizes ritual in other areas such as Jack never missing the convoy. The world of White Noise is still obsessed with ritual despite the absence of religion. Associate Director of Language and Writing, Christopher S. Glover, agreed by stating, \\"Just after the nun tells Jack that there exists nothing worth believing in and that anyone who does believe in something is a fool, DeLillo dangles this event in front of us, daring us to believe in something‚Äîanything‚Äîby using religious buzzwords such as 'mystical', 'exalted', and 'profound' but countering those words with others like 'lame-brained'.\\" In his interview with the Paris Review's Adam Begley, Don DeLillo stated the religious aspect employed in White Noise by stating that the paranoia of the characters operates as a form of religious awe. He added that \\"[religion] is something old, a leftover from some forgotten part of the soul. And the intelligence agencies that create and service this paranoia are not interesting to me as spy handlers or masters of espionage. They represent old mysteries and fascinations, ineffable things. Central intelligence. They're like churches that hold the final secrets.\\" Don DeLillo claims \\"Religion has not been a major element in my work, and for some years now I think the true American religion has been 'the American People.'\\" Cultural references The band The Airborne Toxic Event took their name from the novel. Interpol released a single, \\"The Heinrich Maneuver\\", the title of which is an apparent reference to Jack's son. Film rights The rights to film the novel were acquired by HBO and later by James L. Brooks's Gracie Films, and then again in 1999 by Sonnenfeld/Josephson with Barry Sonnenfeld set to direct, but the option lapsed.

Electroreception or electroception is the biological ability to perceive natural electrical stimuli. It has been observed almost exclusively in aquatic or amphibious animals since water is a much better conductor than air. The known exceptions are the monotremes (echidnas and platypuses), cockroaches, and bees. Electroreception is used in electrolocation (detecting objects) and for electrocommunication.  Overview  Active electrolocation. Conductive objects concentrate the field and resistive objects spread the field. elephantfish (here Gnathonemus) the electric field emanates from an electric organ in the tail region (gray rectangle). It is sensed by the electroreceptive skin areas, using two electric pits (foveas) to actively search and inspect objects. Shown are the field distortions created by two different types of objects: a plant that conducts better than water, above (green) and a non-conducting stone, below (gray).Heiligenberg, Walter (1977) Principles of Electrolocation and Jamming Avoidance in Electric Fish: A Neuroethological Approach Springer-Verlag. . Until recently, electroreception was known only in vertebrates. Recent research has shown that bees can detect the presence and pattern of a static charge on flowers. In vertebrates, electroreception is an ancestral trait, that is to say that it was present in the last common ancestor of all vertebrates. This form of ancestral electroreception is called ampullary electroreception, with the receptive organs themselves called Ampullae of Lorenzini. Not all vertebrates that possess electroreception have Ampullae of Lorenzini. Ampullae of Lorenzini exist in cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, paddlefish, aquatic salamanders, and caecilians. Other vertebrates that have electroreception such as catfish, gymnotiformes, Mormyridiformes, monotremes, and at least one species of cetacean all have different secondarily derived forms of electroreception. Ampullary electroreception is passive, and is used predominantly in predation. Two groups of teleost fishes are weakly electric and engage in active electroreception: the Neotropical knifefishes (Gymnotiformes) and the African elephantfishes (Notopteroidei). A rare terrestrial exception is the Western long-beaked echidna which has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill, compared to 40,000 for its semi-aquatic monotreme relative, the duck-billed platypus. Electrolocation Electroreceptive animals use this sense to locate objects around them. This is important in ecological niches where the animal cannot depend on vision: for example in caves, in murky water and at night. Many fish use electric fields to detect buried prey. Some shark embryos and pups \\"freeze\\" when they detect the characteristic electric signal of their predators. It has been proposed that sharks can use their acute electric sense to detect the earth's magnetic field by detecting the weak electric currents induced by their swimming or by the flow of ocean currents. The walking behaviour of cockroaches can be affected by the presence of a static electric field: they like to avoid the electric field. Cabbage loopers are also known to avoid electric fields. =Active electrolocation= In active electrolocation, the animal senses its surrounding environment by generating electric fields and detecting distortions in these fields using electroreceptor organs. This electric field is generated by means of a specialised electric organ consisting of modified muscle or nerves. This field may be modulated so that its frequency and wave form are unique to the species and sometimes, the individual (see Jamming avoidance response). Animals that use active electroreception include the weakly electric fish, which either generate small electrical pulses (termed \\"pulse-type\\") or produce a quasi- sinusoidal discharge from the electric organ (termed \\"wave-type\\"). These fish create a potential which is usually smaller than one volt. Weakly electric fish can discriminate between objects with different resistance and capacitance values, which may help in identifying the object. Active electroreception typically has a range of about one body length, though objects with an electrical impedance similar to that of the surrounding water are nearly undetectable. =Passive electrolocation= In passive electrolocation, the animal senses the weak bioelectric fields generated by other animals and uses it to locate them. These electric fields are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles. A second source of electric fields in fish is the ion pumps associated with osmoregulation at the gill membrane. This field is modulated by the opening and closing of the mouth and gill slits. Many fish that prey on electrogenic fish use the discharges of their prey to detect them. This has driven the prey to evolve more complex or higher frequency signals that are harder to detect. Passive electroreception is carried out solely by ampullary electroreceptors in fish. It is sensitive to low-frequency signals (from below one, and up to tens of Hertz). Fish use passive electroreception to supplement or replace their other senses when detecting prey and predators. In sharks, sensing an electric dipole alone is sufficient to cause them to try to eat it. Electrocommunication Weakly electric fish can also communicate by modulating the electrical waveform they generate, an ability known as electrocommunication. They may use this for mate attraction and territorial displays. Some species of catfish use their electric discharges only in agonistic displays. In one species of Brachyhypopomus (a genus of South American river fish belonging to the family Hypopomidae, commonly known as bluntnose knifefishes), the electric discharge pattern is similar to the low voltage electrolocative discharge of the electric eel. This is hypothesised to be a form of Batesian mimicry of the powerfully-protected electric eel. Sensory mechanism Active electroreception relies upon tuberous electroreceptors which are sensitive to high frequency (20-20,000 Hz) stimuli. These receptors have a loose plug of epithelial cells which capacitively couples the sensory receptor cells to the external environment. Passive electroreception however, relies upon ampullary receptors which are sensitive to low frequency stimuli (below 50 Hz). These receptors have a jelly-filled canal leading from the sensory receptors to the skin surface. Mormyrid electric fish from Africa use tuberous receptors known as Knollenorgans to sense electric communication signals. Examples = Sharks and rays = Sharks and rays (members of the subclass Elasmobranchii), such as the lemon shark, rely heavily on electrolocation in the final stages of their attacks, as can be demonstrated by the robust feeding response elicited by electric fields similar to those of their prey. Sharks are the most electrically sensitive animals known, responding to DC fields as low as 5 nV/cm. The electric field sensors of sharks are called the ampullae of Lorenzini. They consist of electroreceptor cells connected to the seawater by pores on their snouts and other zones of the head. A problem with the early submarine telegraph cables was the damage caused by sharks who sensed the electric fields produced by these cables. It is possible that sharks may use Earth's magnetic field to navigate the oceans using this sense. = Bony fish = The electric eel (actually a knifefish, not an eel), besides its ability to generate high voltage electric shocks, uses lower voltage pulses for navigation and prey detection in its turbid habitat. This ability is shared with other gymnotiformes. = Monotremes = The platypus is a monotreme mammal that uses electroreception. The monotremes are the only group of land mammals known to have evolved electroreception. While the electroreceptors in fish and amphibians evolved from mechanosensory lateral line organs, those of monotremes are based on cutaneous glands innervated by trigeminal nerves. The electroreceptors of monotremes consist of free nerve endings located in the mucous glands of the snout. Among the monotremes, the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) has the most acute electric sense. The platypus has almost 40,000 electroreceptors arranged in a series of stripes along the bill, which probably aids the localisation of prey. The platypus electroreceptive system is highly directional, with the axis of greatest sensitivity pointing outwards and downwards. By making quick head movements called \\"saccades\\" when swimming, platypuses constantly expose the most sensitive part of their bill to the stimulus to localise prey as accurately as possible. The platypus appears to use electroreception along with pressure sensors to determine the distance to prey from the delay between the arrival of electrical signals and pressure changes in the water. The electroreceptive capabilities of the two species of echidna (which are terrestrial) are much simpler. Long-beaked echidnas (genus Zaglossus) possess only 2,000 receptors and short-beaked echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) have merely 400 concentrated in the tip of the snout. This difference can be attributed to their habitat and feeding methods. Western long-beaked echidnas live in wet tropical forests where they feed on earthworms in damp leaf litter, so their habitat is probably favourable to the reception of electrical signals. Contrary to this is the varied but generally more arid habitat of their short-beaked relative which feeds primarily on termites and ants in nests; the humidity in these nests presumably allows electroreception to be used in hunting for buried prey, particularly after rains. Experiments have shown that echidnas can be trained to respond to weak electric fields in water and moist soil. The electric sense of the echidna is hypothesised to be an evolutionary remnant from a platypus- like ancestor. = Dolphins = Dolphins have evolved electroreception in structures different from those of fish, amphibians and monotremes. The hairless vibrissal crypts on the rostrum of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), originally associated with mammalian whiskers, are capable of electroreception as low as 4.8 ŒºV/cm, sufficient to detect small fish. This is comparable to the sensitivity of electroreceptors in the platypus. To date (June 2013), these cells have been described from only a single dolphin specimen. =Bees= Bees collect a positive static charge while flying through the air. When a bee visits a flower, the charge deposited on the flower leaks over time into the ground. Bees can detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, and use this information to know if a flower has been recently visited by another bee and is likely to have a reduced concentration of nectar. Bees detect electric fields through insulating air by mechano-reception, not electroreception. Bees sense the electric field changes via the Johnston's organs in their antennae and possibly other mechano-receptors. They distinguish different temporal patterns and learn them. During the waggle dance, honeybees appear to use the electric field emanating from the dancing bee for distance communication. Effects on wildlife It has been claimed that the electromagnetic fields generated by pylons and masts have adverse effects on wildlife; a list of 153 references to this has been published.

History The company was established as Lend Lease by Dick Dusseldorp in 1958 to provide finance for building contracts being undertaken by Civil & Civic. In 1961 the company acquired Civil & Civic from Bredero's Bouwbedrijf. In 1970 Lend Lease expanded their operations into America, and in 1983 Lend Lease created 'The Lend Lease Foundation', their charitable arm to improve communication with and help in communities, as well as caring for both community and employee well- being. In 1999 the company formed Actus Lend Lease with the acquisition of Actus Corporation's MILCON and technical service construction management business, and augmented this business with professionals from Lend Lease Design and Lend Lease Development. Also in 1999 the Company acquired Bovis from P&O;, which now forms Lend Lease Project Management & Construction. Then in 2000 it bought AMRESCO's commercial mortgage business In 2001, Lend Lease acquired Delfin Property Group (now Lend Lease Communities) for $172 million. It went on to buy Crosby Homes (now Lend Lease Residential Development) for circa ¬£240 million in 2005.Crosby Homes chiefs in line for ¬£25m from sale to Lend Lease The Times, 24 June 2005 In 2009, the groups current CEO and Managing Director, Steve Mccann, was appointed. In 2009, Lend Lease Corporation acquired Babcock and Brown Communities, rebranding the business as Lend Lease Primelife. At the time, this acquisition made Lend Lease Australia's largest provider of retirement villages. In 2010, Lend Lease announced their first foray into the consumer market with Lend Lease Solar. The subsidiary was wound up in early 2011, with no explanation as to why the division had closed. As of 17 Feb 2011 Lend Lease announced wider ranging changes to its group of brands. This announcement means the retirement of the Bovis, Delfin, Vivas, Catalyst and Primelife brands which will now referred to using the unified Lend Lease brand. In late February 2011, Lend Lease acquired DASCO in order to position itself to take advantage of the impending Obama administration Health sector boom. The company was immediately rebranded as Lend Lease DASCO, and operates independently of the Lend Lease Americas business. In March 2011, Lend Lease completed the acquisition of Valemus (previously known as Bilfinger Berger Australia) from Bilfinger, subsidiaries of Valemus included: Abigroup, Baulderstone and Conneq (formerly Bilfinger Berger Services). The Valemus brand was retired and replaced with Lend Lease in 2011. In 2015, the company rebranded to use \\"Lendlease\\" as a single word.https://www.cmo.com.au/article/575803/lendlease-revitalises-branding- match-next-pipeline-projects/ Regions In December 2016 Lendlease formed a joint venture agreement with Energy Made Clean. Energy Made Clean is a wholly owned subsidiary of renewable energy technology developer, Carnegie Clean Energy (ASX: CCE). With EMC and Carnegie's joint offerings, it is the only company in the world to offer a combination of wave, solar, wind, storage and desalination via microgrids. Microgrids are a budding industry and this partnership aims to provide end-to-end technologies that deliver energy independence and a reliable alternative to traditional forms of energy in regional, remote and fringe-of-grid locations in Australia, United States and around the world. Previous works include the Adelaide Oval upgrade finished in 2014, and the Sydney Opera House, completed in 1973 where Lendlease were the principal contractor. = Asia = Lendlease Asia is working on two large urban development projects, The TRX Lifestyle Quarter in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Paya Lebar Quarter in Singapore, due for phased completion in 2020 and 2019 respectively. Lendlease operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Greater China within the Asian Region. Its regional HQ in Asia is housed within PLQ Workplace at Paya Lebar Quarter. =Americas= In the Americas, Lendlease are based on Park Ave in New York City, United States. Current Projects include Project Southbank, an urban regeneration of an area of Chicago, IL. The development will be finished in the late 2020s, similar to the urban regeneration programmes in the U.K and Australia. tallest residential tower, standing at 425m tall. Lendlease also managed the construction of 432 Park Avenue. At 1,396 feet tall, the structure is the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. Located in one of New York City's most desired neighborhoods, alongside some of the most prestigious retail space in New York. They also provided preconstruction and construction management at risk services for 53 West 53rd Street, a 77-story, 1,050 foot tall luxury condominium tower located in the area bound by 53rd Street and 54th Street and 5th and 6th Avenues. They have also built for clients such as The United Nations, building the 44-story 50 United Nations Plaza in 2015 and managing a new fa√ßade at The American Museum of Natural History, finishing in 2013. In 2012 Lendlease began construction on their first luxury home in an attempt to get into the high-end Southern California mansion market. Soaring Heights at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona, USA Soaring Heights is one of Lendlease's Public Partnerships business in the US. The 6 MW solar development is the largest solar powered community in the continental US, producing more than 10 million kilowatt hours of electricity, providing an estimated 75 percent of the community's energy needs. = Europe = Lendlease oversaw the restoration of the encaustic tile pavements at Palace of Westminster in 2015. Lendlease's European Regional Headquarters is in Regent's Place, London. In Europe, Lendlease mainly manage in the Project Management and Construction of new projects and programmes (Lendlease Project Management & Construction), with current projects including Google's brand new ¬£700m European HQ in King's Cross, and London's first Pan Pacific Hotel for UOL Group in the City of London, which is worth over ¬£500m. In 2015 Lendlease oversaw the restoration of the encaustic tile pavements at The Houses of Parliament. Previous projects in Europe include Bluewater Shopping Centre, which was built in an old disused quarry and was the Europe's leading shopping centre in the late 2000s. King's College London's new science gallery and also completed the pre-construction for both London's Wembley Stadium and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, but pulled out due to fears of escalating costs. They also completed apartments and the ¬£1bn Athlete's Village for the London 2012 Olympics, which were ingenuously designed to become residential apartments once the Olympics had finished. This has turned into continued investment in Stratford through the International Quarter London, a 20-year development focussed on regenerating Stratford into a major area of London, which is all part of London 2012 Olympics's Olympic Legacy. This is the same with Elephant & Castle and Haringey, showing their focus and interest in major urban regeneration programmes in some of the World's major Gateway Cities, which currently include London, Melbourne, Sydney and Milan. Operations The Lendlease Tower in Townsville City, Australia The company operates in more than 40 countries around the world. In all of these, the Lend Lease Project Management & Construction division constructs and manages large building projects. The company runs additional businesses in certain markets, including apartment development, greenfield residential development, investment management of unlisted property funds, property management, Real Estate sales and leasing, Public Private Partnerships, Infrastructure Development and Venture Capital investment in innovative technologies. Some operation projects are these: * Lendlease Investment Management is the largest developer of public-private defence housing in the United States.

Lend Lease specialised exclusively in the development of medical real estate for more than 23 years, has developed more than 3.8 million square feet, acquired 1.5 million square feet and currently manages more than 2.0 million square feet of medical office space. * Lendlease Project Management & Construction constructs significant retail and mixed use projects for Lend Lease's Investment Management Business, and Lend Lease's Development Business as well as working for external third party clients. Post Construction, Lendlease's Retail Business manage the day-to-day operations of retail assets. In Asia, Lend Lease operations throughout Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Japan. Projects include the construction of the Petronas Towers. Lendlease manages 4 retail assets in Singapore (Parkway Parade, 313@somerset, JEM and Paya Lebar Quarter) and 1 retail asset in Malaysia (Setia City Mall). Adelaide Oval Redevelopment, finished in 2014 * Lendlease Development ‚Äì Concentrates on large scale urban regeneration in key areas. Currently, the group has secured significant urban regeneration projects in Sydney at Barangaroo South, in Melbourne at Docklands, Victoria,[1] in Brisbane at the RNA Showgrounds ‚Äì The Green, and around Adelaide's Adelaide Oval. In Europe, Major Urban Regeneration programmes are underway in Elephant and Castle as Elephant Park, and in Stratford, London as The International Quarter London, which are both worth over ¬£2bn and have recently won another in the London Borough of Haringey. * Lendlease Communities (previously Delfin Lend Lease) falls within Lend Lease Development, and is Australia's largest developer of Master Planned Communities. One of Lend Lease's more controversial Communities projects is their development for housing and industry of the former Australian Defence Industries land at St Marys (Ropes Crossing & Jordan Springs) in Western Sydney. Their ADI property is the largest intact area of the biodiverse and endangered plant community, the \\"Cumberland Plain Woodland\\". Some of the group's major Communities projects include Springfield Lakes, Queensland,[5] Recent Public Private Partnership involved InterContinental Hotels Group and Lend Lease (US), where they joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging to deliver quality hotels to United States Army Soldiers, their Families, and official guests of the United States Army. This partnership created IHG Army Hotels, a division of InterContinental Hotels Group. * Lendlease Project Management & Construction operates throughout the European Union and the Middle East on various property and infrastructure related construction projects. Lend Lease's projects in this region include the Torino 2006 winter games facility, Durrat al Bahrain,[6] Warsaw Trade Tower, Prague Ruzynƒõ Airport T2 & Sheremetyevo International Airport T3 Moscow. Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent, finished in 1999. * Lendlease Investment Management operates and manages assets owned by Lendlease managed property funds. Recently these have included shopping centres such as Bluewater, Touchwood Solihull and the Overgate Centre. However, they have since sold their shares in these assets and thus pulled out of their retail development investment business in the UK, which was previously the third largest in that market. It also conducts many \\"public-private partnership\\" developments with the UK government, particularly concentrating on hospital and defence housing estate developments. * Lendlease Residential Development (previously Crosby Lendlease) has been designing and constructing homes for over 80 years. The business now focuses primarily on inner city urban regeneration opportunities within the UK. Projects include i-land ‚Äì Birmingham, Clarence Dock ‚Äì Leeds, Hungate ‚Äì York, Potato Wharf ‚Äì Manchester and as previously mentioned, Elephant & Castle and International Quarter London (both London). * Lendlease Project Management & Construction has significant history in the UK having originated in the 1850s as W C Bovis. The division has constructed many famous buildings, including the 2012 London Olympic Games Village (now the East Village), London's Millennium Dome, The Curve Theatre, Leicester, Media City UK, Royal Festival Hall & BBC's Scotland Headquarters, as well as others mentioned in this article. The company has built, managed and operated eight major Private Finance Initiative hospitals in the UK.

At the heart of the story is a doomed romance which defies the social norms and sparks a growing confrontation with Chrysagon's brother, Draco (Stockwell). Chrysagon encounters Bronwyn (Forsyth), his future love, as she is harassed by his own men. Gradually he finds himself falling for the girl he's rescued. Bronwyn's father, the village chief, Odins, later asks Chrysagon's permission for Bronwyn to marry Marc, to whom Bronwyn has been betrothed since childhood. Chrysagon approves, but soon regrets the decision. He wants Bronwyn for himself. He later learns of \\"Droit du seigneur\\", a right which permits the Lord of the Domain to sleep with any virgin woman on her wedding night. But custom demands Bronwyn be given up by dawn. The following day, Bronwyn is not returned and Marc demands justice. What the village doesn't realize is that she's chosen to stay of her own free will. All of this takes place against the background of war against Frisian raiders who plague the Flemish coast. Soundtrack The film's score was composed by Jerome Moross.

California's Spanish-speaking community has resided there since 1683 and is made up of varying Criollo Spaniard, Mestizo, and Indigenous Californian origins.as quoted in Clark, Donald T. (2008). Santa Cruz County Place Names p.442, Scotts Valley, California, Kestrel Press. Alongside the Tejanos of Texas and Neomexicanos of New Mexico and Colorado, Californios are part of the larger Chicano/Mexican-American/Hispano community of the United States, which has inhabited the American Southwest and the West Coast since the 16th century. The term Californio (historical, regional Spanish for 'Californian') was originally applied to the Spanish-speaking residents of Las Californias during the periods of Spanish California and Mexican California, between 1683 and 1848. The first Californios were the children of the early Spanish military expeditions into northern reaches of the Californias which established the presidios of California and subsequently allowed for the foundation of the California mission system.Hutchinson, C. A. (1969). Frontier settlement in Mexican California: The H√≠jar-Padr√©s colony and its origins, 1769‚Äì1835. New Haven: Yale University Press. Later, the primary cultural focus of the Californio population became the Vaquero tradition practiced by the landed gentry which received land grants creating the Rancho system.Griswold del Castillo, Richard. \\"Californios\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, pp. 514-15. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. In the 1820s-40s, American and European settlers increasingly came to Mexican California, married Californio women, and became Mexican citizens, learning Spanish and often converting to Catholicism, and are often also considered Californios, for their adherence to Californio language and culture. There are 11.9 million Chicanos/Mexican Americans in California (30% of California's population),Statistica Atlas ‚Äì California Ancestry Statistics making up the largest group of 15.2 million California Hispanics (40% of California's population).Latino Caucaus ‚Äì Statistical Picture of Latinos in California ‚Äì 2017 2004 studies estimated that between 300,000 and 500,000 have ancestry descended from the Mexican and Spanish eras of California.  Society and customs  Andr√©s Pico, shown in 1850 in traditional Californio Vaquero attire, served as a California State Senator and Adjutant General of California. = Government = Alta California (\\"Upper California\\") was nominally controlled by a national-government appointed governor.Howard Lamar, editor. The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West, (1977). Harper & Row, New York, pp. 149, 154. The governors of California were at first appointed by the Viceroy (nominally under the control of the Spanish kings), and after 1821 by the approximate 40 Mexican Presidents from 1821 to 1846. The costs of the minimum Alta California government were mainly paid by means of a roughly 40‚Äì100% import tariff collected at the entry port of Monterey. The other center of Spanish power in Alta California was the Franciscan friars who, as heads of the 21 missions, often resisted the powers of the governors.Werner, Michael S., Editor; Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico; Women's Status and Occupation\\". pp. 886‚Äì898; Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers; None of the Franciscan friars were Californios, however, and their influence rapidly waned after the secularization of the missions in the 1830s. Red Lone Star Flag of California was a symbol of the Californio Revolt of 1836, led by Juan Bautista Alvarado. The instability of the Mexican government (especially in its early years), Alta California's geographic isolation, the growing ability of the Alta California's inhabitants to generally make a success of immigrating and an increase in the Californio population created a schism with the national government. As Spanish and Mexican period immigrants were succeeded in number by those that increasing lost an affinity with the national government, an environment developed that did not suppress disagreement with the central government. Governors had little material support from far-away Mexico to deal with Alta Californians, who were left to resolve situations themselves. Mexico-born governor Manuel Victoria was forced to flee in 1831, after losing a fight against a local uprising at the Battle of Cahuenga Pass. As Californios matured to adulthood and increasingly assumed positions of power in the Alta California government (including that of governor), rivalries emerged between northern and southern regions. Several times, Californio leaders attempted to break away from Mexico, most notably Juan Bautista Alvarado in 1836. Southern regional leaders, led by Pio Pico, made several attempts to relocate the capital from Monterey to the more populated Los Angeles.Howard Lamar, editor. The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West, (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 677. = Foreigners = The independence- minded Californios were also influenced by the increasing numbers of immigrant foreigners (mostly English and French, Americans were grouped with the \\"English\\"), who integrated with the Californios, becoming Mexican citizens and gaining land either independently granted to them or through marriage to Californio women; involvement in local politics was inevitable.Howard Lamar, editor. The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West, (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 154. For example, the American Abel Stearns was an ally of the Californio Jos√© Antonio Carrillo in the 1831 Victoria incident, yet sided with the southern Californians against the Californio would-be governor Alvarado in 1836. Alvarado recruited a company of Tennessean riflemen, many of them former trappers who had settled in the Monterey Bay area. The company was led by another American, Isaac Graham. When the Americans refused to fight against fellow Americans, Alvarado was forced to negotiate a settlement. = Ethnic variety = Californios included the descendants of agricultural settlers and retired escort soldiers deployed from what is modern-day Mexico. Most were of mixed ethnicities, usually Mestizo (Spanish and Native American) or mixed African and Amerindian backgrounds. Despite the depictions of the popular shows like Zorro, few Californios were of \\"pure\\" Spanish (Peninsular or Criollo) ancestry. Most with unmixed Spanish ancestry were Franciscan priests, along with career government officials and military officers who did not remain in California.Mason, The Census of 1790; Gostin, Southern California Vital Records; Haas, Conquests and Historical Identities in California; and ; and California Spanish Genealogy ‚Äì California Census 1790. According to mission records (marriage, baptisms, and burials) as well as Presidio roster listings, several \\"leather-jacket\\" soldiers (soldados de cuero) operating as escorts, mission guards, and other military duty personnel were described as europeo (i.e., born in Europe), while most of the civilian settlers were of mixed origins (coyote, mulatto, etc.). The term mestizo was rarely if ever used in mission records, the more common terms being indio, europeo, mulato, coyote, castizo and other caste terms. An example of the number of European- born soldiers is the twenty-five from Lieutenant Pedro Fages detachment of Catalan Volunteers. Most of the soldiers on the Portola-Serra expedition of 1769 and the de Anza expeditions of 1774 and 1775 were recruited from the Spanish Army infantry regiments then stationed in Mexico. Many of them were assigned to garrison the presidios, then retired at the end of their ten-year enlistments, and remaining in California. Because there were many more men than women among the Spanish soldiers and settlers, some men who stayed in California married native Californian women who had converted to Christianity at the missions. = Family and education = The family was characteristically patriarchal, with the son regardless of age, deferring to his father's wishes. Women had full rights of property ownership and control unless she was married or had a father‚Äîthe males had almost complete control of all family members. A formal education system in California had yet to be created so it fell to the individual families to educate their children among them, traditionally done by the priests or hired private tutors; few early immigrants knew how to read or write, so only a few hundred inhabitants could.Harrow, Neal; California Conquered: The Annexation of a Mexican Province, 1846‚Äì1850; pp. 14‚Äì30; University of California Press; 1989; = Women in Californio society = The social life of Californio society was extremely important in both politics and business, and women played an important part in these interactions. They helped facilitate these interactions for their husbands, and therefore themselves, to move up in the social and power rankings of Californio society. This ability to shape social situations was a sought after trait when looking for a spouse, as prominent men knew the power their new wife would have in their future dealings In movies and television, women from this era are often heavily romanticized and commonly characterized by their beauty and fun loving nature, while also being very sheltered and protected.Langum, David J. \\"Californio Women and the Image of Virtue\\". Southern California Quarterly 59.3 (1977): 245‚Äì250. As women played a key role in the development of Alta California and its social interactions they continued this role into its transition from a Mexican territory to an American possession. As foreign non-Spanish speaking men moved into California, who wished to insert themselves into the upper echelons of already established social hierarchy, they began to use marriage with the women of established Californio families as a way to join this hierarchy. Intermarriages between Californios and foreigners was common during the time of Mexican rule and quickly became even more common after the American annexation and Gold Rush in California. These intermarriages worked to combine the cultures of American settlers and merchants with that of the declining Californio society. These marriages though were not enough to prevent the descent into irrelevance of Californio power in California or the racism and attacks on the people of Mexican heritage later. = Repopulation = The Spanish colonial government, and later, Mexican officials encouraged through recruitment civilians from the northern and western provinces of Mexico such as Sonora. This was not well received by Californios, and was one of the factors leading to revolt against Mexican rule. Sonorans came to California despite the area's isolation and the lack of central government support. Many of the soldier's wives considered California to be a cultural wasteland and a hardship assignment. An incentive for the soldiers that remained in California after service was the opportunity to receive a land grant that probably was not possible elsewhere. This made most of California's early settlers military retirees with a few civilian settlers from Mexico. Since it was a frontier society, the initial rancho housing was characterized as rude and crude‚Äîlittle more than mud huts with thatched roofs. As the rancho owners prospered these residences could be upgraded to more substantial adobe structures with tiled roofs. Some buildings took advantage of local tar pits (La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles) in an attempt to waterproof roofs. Restoration of these Today, often suffer from a perception that results in a grander representation than if they had been constructed during the Californio period.Hoffman, Lola B.; California Beginnings; California State Department of Education; 1848; p. 151 = The concession of land = Before Mexican independence in 1821, 20 \\"Spanish\\" land grants had been issued (at little or no cost) in all of Alta California; many to \\"a few friends and family of the Alta California governors\\". The 1824 Mexican General Colonization Law established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Catholic Franciscan missions and possibly entice increased Mexican settlement. When the missions were secularized in 1834‚Äì1836 mission property and livestock were supposed to be mostly allocated to the Mission Indians. Historical research shows that the majority of rancho grants were given to retired non-commissioned soldiers. The largest grants to Nieto, Sepulveda, Dominguez, Yorba, Avila, Grijalva, and other founding families were examples of this practice. Many of the foreign residents also became rancho grantees. Some were \\"Californios by marriage\\" like Stearns (who was naturalized in Mexico before moving north) and the Englishman William Hartnell. Others married Californios but never became Mexican citizens. Rancho ownership was possible for these men because, under Spanish/Mexican law, married women could independently hold title to property. In the Santa Cruz area, three Californio daughters of the inv√°lido Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Castro (1768‚Äì1838) married foreigners yet still received grants to Rancho Soquel, Rancho San Agustin and Rancho Refugio. = Ranchos = In practice nearly all mission property and livestock became about 455 large Ranchos of California granted by the Californio authorities. The Californio rancho owners claimed about averaging about each. This land was nearly all originally mission land within about of the coast. The Mexican-era land grants by law were provisional for five years in order for the terms of the law to reasonably be fulfilled. The boundaries of these ranchos were not established as they came to be in later times predominately based on what could be understood as figurative boundaries. They were based on just where another granted owner considered the end of their land, lands or vegetation landmarks.Walton Bean, California: An Interpretive History, Second Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, p. 152. Conflict was bound to occur when these land grants were reviewed under United States control. Title to some grants under United States control were rejectedHoward Lamar, editor. The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West, (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 633. based on questionable documents especially when with predated documents, that could have been created post-United States occupancy in January 1847.Walton Bean, California: An Interpretive History, Second Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, p. 159. = Rancho culture = After agriculture, cattle, sheep and horses were established by the Missions, Friars, soldiers and Mission Indians, the Rancho owners dismissed the Friars and the soldiers and took over the Mission land and livestock starting in 1834‚Äîthe Mission Indians were left to survive however they could. The rancho owners tried to live in a grand style they perceived of the wealthy hidalgos in Spain. They expected the non-rancho owning population to support this lifestyle. Nearly all males rode to where ever they were going at nearly all times making them excellent riders. They indulged in many fiestas, fandangos, rodeos and roundups as the rancho owners often went from rancho to rancho on a large horse bound party circuit. Weddings, christenings, and funerals were all \\"celebrated\\" with large gatherings. = Taxes = Since the government depended on import tariffs (also called Custom duties and ad-valorem taxes) for its income there was virtually no property tax. Under Spanish/Mexican rule, all landowners were expected to the Diezmo, a compulsory tithe to the Catholic Church of one tenth of the fruits of agriculture and animal husbandry, business profits or salaries. Priest salaries and mission expenses were paid out of this money and/or collected goods. The mandatory Diezmo ended with the secularization of the missions, greatly reducing rancho taxes until the U.S. takeover. Today's state property tax system makes large self- supporting cattle ranches uneconomical in most cases. = Frequency of use of horses = Horses were plentiful and often left, after being broken in, to wander around with a rope around their neck for easy capture. It was not unusual for a rider to use one horse until it was exhausted, before switching its bridle to another horse‚Äîletting the first horse free to wander. Horse ownership for all except a few exceptional animals were almost community property. Horses were so common and of so little use that they were often destroyed to keep them from eating the grass needed by the cattle. California Indians later developed a taste for horse flesh as food and helped keep the number of horses under control. An unusual use for horses was found in shucking wheat or barley. The wheat and its stems were cut from the gain fields by Indians bearing sickles. The grain with its stems still attached was transported to the harvesting area by solid wheeled ox-cart (about the only wheeled transport in California) and put into a circular packed earth corral. A herd of horses were then driven into the same corral or \\"threshing field\\". By keeping the horses moving around the corral their hoofs would, in time, separate the wheat or barley from the chaff. Later the horses would be allowed to escape and the wheat and chaff were collected and then separated by tossing it into the air on a windy day so as to let the wind carry the chaff away. Presumably the wheat was washed before use to remove some of the dirt.Hoffman, Lola B.; California Beginnings; California State Department of Education; 1948; p. 195 = The Native American work force = For these very few rancho owners and their families, this was the Californio's Golden Age, although for all the others much different. Much of the agriculture, vineyards and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining mission Native American population went from over 80,000 in 1800 to only a few thousand by 1846. Fewer Native Americans meant less food was required and the Franciscan Friars and soldiers supporting the missions disappeared after 1834 when the missions were abolished (secularized). After the Friars and soldiers disappeared, many of the Native Americans deserted the missions and returned to their tribes or found work elsewhere. The new ranchos often gave work to some of the former mission Native Americans. The \\"Savage tribes\\" worked for room, board and clothing (and no pay). The former mission Indians performed the majority of the work herding cattle, planting and harvesting the ranchos' crops. The slowly increasing ranchos and Pueblos at Los Angeles, San Diego, Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Jose and Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) mostly only grew enough food to eat and to trade. The exceptions were the cattle and horses growing wild on unfenced range land. Originally owned by the missions they were killed for their hides and tallow. = Leather and food = Leather, one of the most common materials available, was used for many products, including saddles, chaps, whips, window and door coverings, riatas (leather braided rope), trousers, hats, stools, chairs, bed frames, etc. Leather was even used for leather armor where soldiers' jackets were made from several layers of hardened leather sewn together. This stiff leather jacket was sufficient to stop most Indian arrows and worked well when fighting the Indians. Beef was a common constituent of most Californio meals and since it couldn't be kept long in the days before refrigeration, beef was often slaughtered to get a few steaks or cuts of meat. The property and yards around the ranchos were marked by the large number of dead cow heads, horns or other animal parts. Cow hides were kept later for trading purposes with Yankee or British traders who started showing up once or twice a year after 1825.Howard Lamar, editor. The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West, (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 149. Beef, wheat bread products, corn (maize), several types of beans, peas and several types of squash were common meal items with wine and olive oil used when they could be found. The mestizo population probably subsisted mostly on what they were used to: corn or maize, beans, and squash with some beef donated by the rancho owners. What the average Native Americans ate is unknown since they were in transition from a hunter gatherer society to agriculturalists. Formerly, many lived at least part of the year on ground acorns, fish, seeds, wild game, etc. It is known that many of the ranchers complained about 'Indians' stealing their cattle and horses to eat. = Trade = From about 1769 to 1824 California averaged about 2.5 ships per year with 13 years showing no ships coming to California. These ships brought a few new settlers and supplies for the pueblos and Missions. Under the Spanish colonial government rules, trade was actively discouraged with non-Spanish ships. The few non-Native American people living in California had almost nothing to trade‚Äîthe missions and pueblos were subsidized by the Spanish government. The occasional Spanish ships that did show up were usually requested by Californios and had Royal permission to go to California‚Äîbureaucracy in action. Prior to 1824, when the newly independent Mexico liberalized the trade rules and allowed trade with non-Mexican ships, the occasional trading ship or U.S. whaler that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh meat and vegetables became more common. The average number of ships from 1825 to 1845 jumped to twenty-five ships per year versus the 2.5 ships per year common for the prior fifty years. The rancho society had few resources except large herds of Longhorn cattle which grew well in California. The ranchos produced the largest cowhide (called California Greenbacks) and tallow business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off the fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears that were common in California. With something to trade, and needing everything from nails, needles and almost anything made of metal to fancy thread and cloth that could be sewn into fancy cloaks or ladies' dresses, etc., they started trading with merchant ships from Boston, Massachusetts, Britain and other trading ports in Europe and the East Coast of the United States. The trip from Boston, New York City or Liverpool England averaged over 200 days one way. Trading ships and the occasional whaler put into San Diego, San Juan Capistrano, San Pedro, San Buenaventura (Ventura), Monterey and Yerba Buena (San Francisco) after stopping and paying the import tariff of 50‚Äì100% at the entry port of Monterey, California. These tariffs or custom fees paid for the Alta California government. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast (originally published 1840) by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. gives a good first-hand account of a two-year sailing ship sea trading voyage to Alta California which he took in 1834-5. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of California longhorn horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items during this period. California was not alone in using the import duty to pay for its government as the U.S. import tariffs at this time were also the way the United States paid for most of its Federal Government. A U.S. average tariff (also called custom duties and ad valorem taxes) of about 25% raised about 89% of all Federal income in 1850.Federal Income 1850 Federal State Local Government Revenue in United States 2011 ‚Äì Charts Tables Accessed April 2, 2011  History  = Early colonization = In 1769, Gaspar de Portol√† and less than two hundred men, on expedition founded the Presidio of San Diego (military post).

Monterey, California was established in 1770 by Father Jun√≠pero Serra and Gaspar de Portol√† (first governor of Las Californias province (1767‚Äì1770), explorer and founder of San Diego and Monterey). Monterey was settled with two friars and about 40 men and served as the capital of California from 1777 to 1849. The nearby Carmel Mission, in Carmel, California was moved there after a year in Monterey to keep the mission and its Mission Indians away from the Monterey Presidio soldiers. It was the headquarters of the original Alta California province missions headed by Father-President Jun√≠pero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784‚Äîhe is buried there. Monterey was originally the only port of entry for all taxable goods in California. All ships were supposed to clear through Monterey and pay the roughly 42% tariff (customs duties on imported goods before trading anywhere else in Alta California. The oldest governmental building in the state is the Monterey Custom House and California's Historic Landmark Number One.California State Parks: Custom House The Californian, California's oldest newspaper, was first published in Monterey on August 15, 1846, after the city's occupation by the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron on July 7, 1846.Library of Congress.

Late in 1775, Colonel Juan Bautista de Anza led an overland expedition over the Gila River trail he had discovered in 1774 to bring colonists from Sonora New Spain (Mexico) to California to settle two missions, one presidio, and one pueblo (town). Anza led 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They started out with 695 horses and mules and 385 Texas Longhorn bulls and cows‚Äîstarting the cattle and horse industry in California. About 600 horses and mules and 300 cattle survived the trip. In 1776 about 200 leather- jacketed soldiers, Friars, and colonists with their families moved to what was called Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) to start building a mission and a presidio there. The leather jackets the soldiers wore consisted of several layers of hardened leather and were strong enough body armor to usually stop an Indian arrow. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years and essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals‚Äîdoubling roughly every two years. They partially displaced the Tule Elk and pronghorn antelope who had lived there in large herds previously. Anza selected the sites of the Presidio of San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de As√≠s in what is now San Francisco; on his way back to Monterey, he sited Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s and the pueblo San Jose in the Santa Clara Valley but did not initially leave settlers to settle them. Mission San Francisco de As√≠s (or Mission Dolores), the sixth Spanish mission, was founded on June 29, 1776, by Lieutenant Jos√© Joaquin Moraga and Father Francisco Pal√≥u (a companion of Jun√≠pero Serra). On November 29, 1777, El Pueblo de San Jos√© de Guadalupe (The Town of Saint Joseph of Guadalupe now called simply San Jose) was founded by Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Moraga on the first pueblo-town not associated with a mission or a military post (presidio) in Alta California. The original San Jose settlers were part of the original group of 200 settlers and soldiers that had originally settled in Yerba Buena (San Francisco). Mission Santa Clara, founded in 1777, was the eighth mission founded and closest mission to San Jose. Mission Santa Clara was from the original San Jose pueblo site in neighboring Santa Clara. Mission San Jos√© was not founded until 1797, about north of San Jose in what is now Fremont. The Los Angeles Pobladores (\\"villagers\\") is the name given to the 44 original Sonorans‚Äî22 adults and 22 children‚Äîwho settled the Pueblo of Los Angeles in 1781. The pobladores were agricultural families from Sonora, Mexico. They were the last settlers to use the Anza trail as the Quechans (Yumas) closed the trail for the next 40 years shortly after they had passed over it. Almost none of the settlers were espa√±oles (Spanish); the rest had casta (caste) designations such as mestizo, indio, and negro. Some classifications were changed in the California Census of 1790, as often happened in colonial Spanish America.\\"The Census of 1790, California\\", California Spanish Genealogy. Retrieved on 2008-08-04. Compiled from William Marvin Mason, The Census of 1790: A Demographic History of California, Menlo Park: Ballena Press, 1998, pp. 75‚Äì105. Information in parentheses () is from church records. The settlers and escort soldiers who founded the towns of San Jos√© de Guadalupe, Yerba Buena (San Francisco), Monterey, San Diego and La Reina de Los √Ångeles were primarily mestizo and of mixed Negro and Native American ancestry from the province of Sonora y Sinaloa in Mexico. Recruiters in Mexico of the Fernando Rivera y Moncada expedition and other expeditions later, who were charged with founding an agricultural community in Alta California, had a difficult time persuading people to emigrate to such an isolated outpost with no agriculture, no towns, no stores or developments of almost any kind. The majority of settlers were recruited from the northwestern parts of Mexico. The only tentative link with Mexico was via ship after the Quechans (Yumas) closed the Colorado River's Yuma Crossing in 1781. For the next 40 years, an average of only 2.5 ships per year visited California with 13 years showing no recorded ships arriving. In Californio society, casta (caste) designations carried more weight than they did in older communities of central Mexico. One similar concept was the gente de raz√≥n, a term literally meaning \\"people of reason\\". It designated peoples who were culturally Hispanic (that is, they were not living in traditional Native American communities) and had adopted Christianity. This served to distinguish the Mexican Indio settlers and converted Californian Indios from the barbaro (barbarian) Californian Native Americans, who had not converted or become part of the Hispanic towns.Rios- Bustamante, Antonio. Mexican Los √Ångeles, 43. California's Governor P√≠o Pico was criticized for his alleged descent from mestizo and mulato (mulatto) settlers. = The end of Mexican rule = In the 1830s the newly formed Mexican government was experiencing difficulties having gone through several revolts, wars, and internal conflicts and a seemingly never ending string of Mexican Presidents. One of the problems in Mexico was the large amount of land controlled by the Catholic Church (estimated then at about one-third of all settled property) who were continually granted property by many land owners when they died or controlled property supposedly held in trust for the Native Americans. This land, as it gradually accumulated, was seldom sold as it cost nothing to keep, but could be rented out to gain additional income for the Catholic Church to pay its priests, Friars, Bishops etc. and other expenses. The Catholic Church was the largest and richest land owner in Mexico and its provinces. In California the situation was even more pronounced as the Franciscan Friars held over 90% of all settled property supposedly in trust for the Mission Indians. In 1834 secularization laws secularization laws accessed July 7, 2011 were enacted that voided the mission control of lands in the northern settlements under Mexican rule. The missions controlled over 90% of the settled land in California as well as directing thousands of Indians in herding livestock, growing crops and orchards, weaving cloth, etc. for the missions and the presidios and pueblo (town) dwellers. The mission lands and herds formerly controlled by the missions were usually distributed to the settlers around each mission. Since most had almost no money the land was distributed or granted free or at very little cost to friends and families (or those who paid the highest bribes) of the government officials. The Californio Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, for example, was reputed to be the richest man in California before the California Gold Rush. Vallejo oversaw the secularization of Mission San Francisco Solano and the distributions of its roughly . He founded the towns of Sonoma, California and Petaluma, California, owned Mare Island and the future town site of Benicia, California and was granted the Rancho Petaluma, the Rancho Suscol and other properties by Governor Jos√© Figueroa in 1834 and later. Vallejo's younger brother, Jose Manuel Salvador Vallejo (1813‚Äì1876), was granted the Rancho Napa and other additional grants known as Salvador's Ranch. Over the hills of Mariano Vallejo's princely estate of Petaluma roamed ten thousand cattle, four to six thousand horses, and many thousands of sheep. He occupied a baronial castle on the plaza at Sonoma, where he entertained all who came with most royal hospitality and few travelers of note came to California without visiting him. At Petaluma he had a great ranch house called La Hacienda and on his home farm called Lachryma Montis (Tear of the Mountain), he built, about 1849, a modern frame house where he spent the later years of his life. Vallejo tried to get the California State Capital moved permanently to Benicia, California on land he sold to the state government in December 1851. It was named Benicia for the General's wife, Francisca Benicia Carillo de Vallejo. The General intended that the prospective city be named \\"Francisca\\" after his wife, but this name was dropped when the former city of \\"Yerba Buena\\" changed its name to \\"San Francisco\\" on January 30, 1847. Benicia was the third site selected to serve as the California state capital, and its newly constructed city hall was California's capitol from February 11, 1853 to February 25, 1854. Vallejo gave the Rancho Suscol to his oldest daughter, Epifania Guadalupe Vallejo, April 3, 1851, as a wedding present, when she married U.S. Army General John H. Frisbie. It is unknown what he gave as a wedding present when his two daughters Natalia and Jovita married the brothers Attila Haraszthy and Agoston Haraszthy on the same day‚ÄîJune 1, 1863. In some cases particular mission land and livestock were split into parcels and then distributed by drawing lots. In nearly all cases the Indians got very little of the mission land or livestock. Whether any of the proceeds of these sales made its way back to Mexico City is unknown. These lands had been worked by settlers and the much larger settlements of local Native American Kumeyaay peoples on the missions for in some cases several generations. When the missions were secularized or dismantled and the Indians did not have to live under continued Friar and military control they were left essentially to survive on their own. Many of the Native Americans reverted to their former tribal existence and left the missions while others found they could get room and board and some clothing by working for the large ranches that took over the former mission lands and livestock. Many natives who had learned to ride horses and had a smattering of Spanish were recruited to be become vaqueros (cowboys or cattle herders) that worked the cattle and horses on the large ranchos and did other work. Some of these rancho owners and their hired hands would make up the bulk of the few hundred Californios fighting in the brief Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War conflicts in California. Some of the Californios and California Native Americans would fight on the side of the U.S. settlers during the conflict with some even joining the California Battalion. = Mexican Governors of California = The Californios had a succession of Mexican appointed governors who nearly all either died in office or were driven from office. Many of governors appointed by Mexico proved to be mediocre, autocratic and indifferent to Californio concerns or needs and were driven from office. The native Californio governors were usually self-appointed and acted as governor pro tempore until Mexico heard about the previous Governor's death or ouster and they could appoint a new governor or approve the existing governor‚Äîoften a slow process. The Californios had such poor luck with Mexican troops (often unpaid convicts) and Mexican appointed governors that many resented Mexican interference in what they considered their internal affairs. * List of Governors * 1822‚Äì1825: Luis Antonio Arg√ºello, born in San Francisco; the first native‚Äìborn Californio to govern Alta California * 1825‚Äì1831: Jos√© Mar√≠a de Echeand√≠a, Mexico appointed; first of two terms * 1831‚Äì1832: Manuel Victoria, Mexico appointed; forced from office after one year * 1832: P√≠o Pico, native-born Californio, native of San Diego and favored British acquisition of California; moved capital from Monterey to Los Angeles * 1832‚Äì1833: Agust√≠n V.

P√≠o Pico, a Californio, was the governor of California during the conflict. taking San Diego 1846 The Pacific Squadron, the United States Naval force stationed in the Pacific was instrumental in the capture of Alta California after war was declared on April 24, 1846. The American navy with its force of 350‚Äì400 U.S. Marines and \\"bluejacket\\" sailors on board several U.S. Naval ships near California were essentially the only significant United States military force on the Pacific Coast in the early months of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The British navy Pacific Station ships in the Pacific had more men and were more heavily armed than the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron, but did not have orders to help or hinder the occupation of California. New orders would have taken almost two years to get back to the British ships. The Marines were stationed aboard each ship to assist in ship-to-ship combat, as snipers in the rigging, and to defend against boarders. They could also be detached for use as armed infantry. In addition, there were some \\"bluejacket\\" sailors on each ship that could be detached for shore duty as artillery crews and infantry, leaving the ship functional though short handed. The artillery used were often small naval cannon converted to land use. The Pacific Squadron had orders, in the event of war with Mexico, to seize the ports in Mexican California and elsewhere along the Pacific Coast. The only other United States military force in California at the time was a small exploratory expedition led by Lieutenant Colonel John C. Fr√©mont, made up of 30 topographical, surveying, etc. army troops and about 25 men hired as guides and hunters. The Fr√©mont expedition had been dispatched to California, in 1845, from the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. California state flag flying at San Francisco City Hall Rumors that the Californio government in California was planning to arrest and deport many of the new residents as they had in 1844 led to a degree of uncertainty. On June 14, 1846, thirty-three settlers in Sonoma Valley took preemptive action and captured the small Californio garrison of Sonoma, California without firing a shot and raised a homemade flag with a bear and star (the \\"Bear Flag\\") to symbolize their taking control. The words \\"California Republic\\" appeared on the flag but were never officially adopted by the insurgents. The present Flag of California is based on the original \\"Bear Flag\\". Their capture of the small garrison in Sonoma was later called the \\"Bear Flag Revolt\\". The Republic's only commander-in-chief was William B. Ide,William B. Ide Adobe State Historic Park, California State Parks. whose command lasted 25 days. On June 23, 1846, Fr√©mont arrived from the future state of Oregon's border with about 30 soldiers and 30 scouts and hunters and took command of the \\"Republic\\" in the name of the United States. Fr√©mont began to recruit a militia from among the new settlers living around Sutters Fort to join with his forces. Many of these settlers had just arrived over the California Trail and many more would continue to arrive after July 1846 when they got to California. The Donner Party were the last travelers on the trail in late 1846 when they were caught by early snow while they were trying to get across the Sierras. Under orders from John D. Sloat, Commodore of the Pacific Squadron, the U.S. Marines and some of the bluejacket sailors from the U.S. Navy sailing ships with the and captured the Alta California capital city of Monterey, California on July 7, 1846. The only shots fired were salutes by the U.S. Navy ships in the harbor to the U.S. flag now flying over Monterey. Two days later on July 9, , under Captain John S. Montgomery, landed 70 Marines and bluejacket sailors at Clark's Point in San Francisco Bay and captured Yerba Buena (now named San Francisco) without firing a shot. On July 11 the British Royal Navy sloop entered San Francisco Bay, causing Montgomery to man his defenses. The large British ship, 2,600 tons with a crew of 600, man-of- war , flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, also arrived at about this time outside Monterey Harbor. Both British ships observed, but did not enter the conflict.Marley, David; Wars of the Americas: a chronology of armed conflict in the New World, 1492 to present [1998); p. 504 Shortly after July 9, when it became clear the US Navy was taking action, the short-lived Bear Flag Republic was converted into a United States military occupation and the Bear Flag was replaced by the U.S. flag. Commodore Robert F. Stockton took over as the senior U.S. military commander in California in late July 1846 and asked Fr√©mont's force of California militia and his 60 men to form the California Battalion with U.S. Army pay and ranks with Fremont in command. The California \\"Republic\\" disbanded and William Ide enlisted in the California Battalion, when it was established in late July 1846, as a private. The first job given to the California Battalion and was to assist in the capture of San Diego and Pueblo de Los Angeles. On July 26, 1846, Lt. Col. J. C. Fr√©mont's California Battalion of about 160 boarded the sloop , under the command of Captain Samuel Francis Du Pont, and sailed for San Diego. They landed July 29, 1846, and a detachment of Marines and blue-jackets, followed shortly by Fr√©mont's California Battalion from Cyane, landed and took possession of the town without firing a shot. Leaving about 40 men to garrison San Diego, Fremont continued on to Los Angeles where on August 13, with the Navy band playing and colors flying, the combined forces of Stockton and Fr√©mont entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, without a man killed nor shot fired. U.S. Marine Lieutenant Archibald Gillespie, Fr√©mont's second in command, was appointed military commander of Los Angeles with an inadequate force from 30 to 50 California Battalion troops stationed there to keep the peace. In Pueblo de Los Angeles, the largest city in California with about 3,000 residents, things might have remained peaceful, except that Major Gillespie placed the town under martial law, greatly angering some of the Californios. On September 23, 1846, about 200 Californios under Californio Gen. Jos√© Mar√≠a Flores staged a revolt, the Siege of Los Angeles, and exchanged shots with the Americans in their quarters at the Government House. Gillespie and his men withdrew from their headquarters in town to Fort Hill which, unfortunately, had no water. Gillespie was caught in a trap, badly outnumbered by the besiegers. John Brown, an American, called by the Californios Juan Flaco, meaning \\"Lean John\\", succeeded in breaking through the Californio lines and riding by horseback to San Francisco Bay (a distance of almost ) in an amazing 52 hours where he delivered to Stockton a dispatch from Gillespie notifying him of the situation. Gillespie, on September 30, finally accepted the Californio terms and departed for San Pedro with his forces, weapons, flags and two cannon (the others were spiked and left behind). Gillespie's men were accompanied by the exchanged American prisoners and several non-Californio residents. It would take about four months of intermittent sparing before Gillespie could again raise the same American flag originally flown over Los Angeles. Los Angeles was retaken without a fight on January 10, 1847.Marley, David; Wars of the Americas: a chronology of armed conflict in the New World, 1492 to present; p. 510 Following their defeat at the Battle of La Mesa, the Californio government signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, which ended the war in California on January 13, 1847. The main Californio military force, known as the Californio lancers, was disbanded. On January 16, 1847, Commodore Stockton appointed Fr√©mont military governor of U.S. territorial California. Some Californios fought on both sides of the conflict (U.S. and Mexico). The battlefield memorials attest to the heroic fight and loss on both sides. = Californio battles = Most towns in California surrendered without a shot being fired on either side. What little fighting that did occur usually involved small groups of disaffected Californios and small groups of soldiers, marines or militia. * 1846 ** Battle of Dominguez Rancho, October 9, 1846. Jos√© Antonio Carrillo, near Los Angeles, leads Californio forces against 350 marines and sailors who retreated. ** Battle of San Pascual, a rousing Californio victory led by Don Andr√©s Pico against a superior force led by Gen. Stephen W. Kearny. Kearny had underestimated Californio anger toward John C. Fremont, and his troops were tired after crossing the desert from New Mexico. Battle of San Pasqual, 6 December 1846. US Cavalry General Stephen Kearny's dragoons, after a grueling journey across New Mexico and the Mojave Desert, cross into California with about 100 men and are joined by Kit Carson's 20 scouts and about 40 men under Gillespie north of San Diego. In a poorly thought out and uncoordinated attack with wet powder and worn out mules Kearny loses about 19 of his men in a fight with about 150 Californio lancers led by Andr√©s Pico‚Äîbrother of Pio Pico. Californio casualties are unknown. By the time reinforcements came from U.S. forces in San Diego, the Californio forces were already gone. ** Temecula Massacre, December 1846. Californios and Cahuilla Indians combine to wipe out a party of Pauma Band Luise√±o Indians responsible for a massacre of eleven Californios, near Temecula. . * 1847 ** January 5, 1847. Fr√©mont near the San Buenaventura Mission, with about 400 men and six field pieces, disperses a force of 60‚Äì70 Californio Lancers. ** Battle of Rio San Gabriel, January 8, 1847. Stephen Kearny and Stockton's combined force of about 600 men (about a battalion equivalent) defeat the roughly 160-man Californio Lancer force near Los Angeles. Casualties are about one man on each side. ** Battle of La Mesa, January 9, 1847. Kearny and Robert F. Stockton's combined US forces defeat the Californios in the final battle in California, at present day Montebello, east of Los Angeles. Casualties are about one man on each side. In late December, 1846, while Fremont was in Santa Barbara, Bernarda Ru√≠z de Rodriguez, a wealthy educated woman of influence and town matriarch, asked to speak with him. She advised him that a generous peace would be to his political advantage. Fremont later wrote of this 2-hour meeting, \\"I found that her object was to use her influence to put an end to the war, and to do so upon such just and friendly terms of compromise as would make the peace acceptable and enduring\\". The next day, Bernarda accompanied Fremont south. On January 11, 1847, General Jose Maria Flores turned over his command to Andr√©s Pico and fled. On January 12, Bernarda went alone to Pico's camp and told him of the peace agreement she and Fremont had forged. Fremont and two of Pico's officers agreed to the terms for a surrender, and Jose Antonio Carrillo penned Articles of Capitulation in both English and Spanish. The first seven articles were nearly the verbatim suggestions of Bernarda. On January 13, at a deserted rancho at the north end of Cahuenga Pass (modern-day North Hollywood), John Fremont, Andres Pico and six others signed the Articles of Capitulation, which became known as the Treaty of Cahuenga. Fighting ceased, thus ending the war in California.Walker p. 246 = Californios after U.S. annexation = In 1848, Congress set up a Board of Land Commissioners to determine the validity of Mexican land grants in California. California Senator William M. Gwin presented a bill that, when approved by the Senate and the House on March 3, 1851 became the California Land Act of 1851.Robinson, p. 100 It stated that unless grantees presented evidence supporting their title within two years, the property would automatically pass back into the public domain.House Executive Document 46, pp. 1116‚Äì1117 Rancho owners cited the articles VIII and X of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, wherein it guaranteed full protection of all property rights for Mexican citizens‚Äîwith an unspecified time limit.Article VIII, Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Center For Land Grant Studies.Article X, Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Center For Land Grant Studies. Many ranch owners with their thousands of acres and large herds of cattle, sheep and horses went on to live prosperous lives under U.S. rule. Former commander of the California Lancers Andr√©s Pico became a U.S. citizen after his return to California and acquired the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando ranch which makes up large part of what is present day Los Angeles. He went on to become a California State Assemblyman and later a California State Senator. His brother former governor of Alta California (under Mexican rule) P√≠o Pico also became a U.S. citizen and a prominent ranch owner/businessman in California after the war. Many others were not so fortunate as droughts decimated their herds in the early 1860s and they could not pay back the high cost mortgages (poorly understood by the mostly illiterate ranchers) they had taken out to improve their lifestyle and subsequently lost much or all of their property when they could not be repaid. Californios did not disappear. Some people in the area still have strong identities as Californios. Thousands of people who are descended from the Californios have well-documented genealogies of their families. Mexican activists claim there was an integrated society of Mexicans, Native Americans, Mestizos and American immigrants, which had evolved over 77 years beginning with the founding of Misi√≥n San Diego in the Alta California territory in 1769. The developing agricultural economy of California allowed many Californios to continue living in pueblos alongside Native peoples and Mexicanos well into the 20th century. These settlements grew into modern California cities, including Santa Ana, San Diego, San Fernando, San Jose, Monterey, Los Alamitos, San Juan Capistrano, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Arvin, Mariposa, Hemet and Indio. From the 1850s until the 1960s, the Hispanics (of Spanish, Mexican and regional Native American origins) lived in relative autonomy. They practiced a degree of social racial segregation by custom, while maintaining Spanish-language newspapers, entertainment, schools, bars, and clubs. Cultural practices were often tied to local churches and mutual aid societies. At some point in the early 20th century, the official recordkeepers (census takers, city records, etc.) began grouping together all Californios, Mexicanos, and Native (Indio) peoples with Spanish surnames under the terms \\"Spanish\\", \\"Mexican\\", and sometimes, \\"colored\\"; some Californios even intermarried with Mexican Americans (those whose ancestors were refugees escaping the Mexican Revolution in 1910). Alexander V. King has estimated that there were between 300,000 and 500,000 descendants of Californios in 2004. = Californios in the California Gold Rush = In 1848, gold is discovered at Sutter‚Äôs Mill, near Coloma, California. This discovery was made only nine days before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, which turned over California to the United States as a result of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. A group of Californio prospectors led by Antonio F. Coronel set out from Los Angeles to prospect for gold in Campo Seco. After a change of plans, the group spent a few months in campo de Estanilo mining alongside mostly Californios. After this, they left to head north into Sonoma, where one of the group members is ambushed and violently attacked, left for dead with only Colonel to tend to him. This ambush and lack of response by any authorities or other White Americans shows how Californios were tragically the victims of Euro-American vigilante violence and often forced to leave their native land.  Large influx of foreigners diluting Californio population  From the end of 1849 to the end of 1852, the population in California increased from 107,000 to 264,000 due to the California Gold Rush. In early 1849, approximately 6,000 Mexicans, many of whom were Californios who remained after the United States had annexed the territory, were prospecting for gold in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Although the territory they were in had up until recently been Mexican land, Californios and other Mexicans very quickly became the minorities and were seen as the foreigners. Once the Gold Rush had truly started in 1849, the campsites were segregated by nationality, further establishing the fact that \\"Americans\\" had taken the title as the majority ethnicity in Northern California. Because the Californio \\"foreigners\\" so quickly became a minority, their claims to land protected under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo were ignored when miners overran their land and squatted. Any protests by Californios were quickly put down by hastily formed Euro-American militias, so any legal protection provided by the new California legislature was ineffective when the threat of violence and lynchings loomed. Even if Californios were able to win their land back in court, often lawyer's fees cost large sums of land that left them with a fraction of their former wealth.  Working conditions  Many Latino miners were experienced due to learning a \\"dry-digging\\" technique in the Mexican mining state of Sonora.Adrianna Thomas, Raymond Arthur Smith, 2009, Latino and Asian Americans in the California Gold Rush, Columbia University Academic Commons,http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8417. Their early success due praise and respect from Euro-American miners, they eventually became jealous and used threats and violence to force Mexican workers out of their plots and into less lucrative ones. In addition to these informal forms of discrimination, Anglo miners also worked to establish Jim Crow-like laws to prevent Latinos from mining altogether. In 1851, mob violence as well as the Foreign Miners' Tax discussed below forced between five thousand and fifteen thousand foreigners out of work in just a few months. According to Antonio F. Coronel's accounts, there was systematic race-influenced violence conducted by Americans to force out Californios and other Latinos. One account tells of a Frenchman and \\"un espa√±ol\\" being lynched for supposed theft in 1848. Despite offers by Californios to replace the reported amount of gold stolen, they were still hanged. In addition, later in the Gold Rush, Coronel and his group found a rich vein of gold on the American River. When Euro-Americans caught wind of this, the invaded the claim armed and insisted it was their plot, forcing out Colonel and ending his mining career. Accounts like these show the harsh and violent living and working conditions that Californios were faced with during the Gold Rush. Discriminatory and racist treatment and laws as well as being so vastly outnumbered forced them out of their native lands despite assurances by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that they could remain.  Foreign Miners' Tax  In response to the Mexican resistance to the American population, white miners called for something to be done about the \\"Sonoran\\" miner \\"problem\\". In response, in 1850, the Californian government introduced a tax on foreign miners who were working plots, called the Foreign Miners' Tax Law. The claimed purpose of the tax was to fund the government's efforts to protect the foreign workers. There are conflicting reports on the amount of the tax ranging from $20 to $30 per month. This extremely high tax forced all but the most successful Latinos to stop mining as they were unable to obtain enough gold to make mining profitable. This left only the most successful of the Mexican prospectors, who ironically were the ones who drew the most ire from the Euro-American miners initially. By 1851, when the tax law was repealed, approximately two-thirds of the Latinos and Californios that had been living and working in mining areas had been driven out by the tax.Mora, Anthony. \\"Introduction to Latino Studies\\". Tisch Hall, Ann Arbor. 9-28-2015. Lecture. After repealing the $20 or $30 per month tax, the California legislature instituted a much more reasonable $3 per month tax in 1852. However, at this point, many of the Californios had already been driven out of their homes and mining plots, making it somewhat of a moot point. These taxes were for the most part only enforced against Latinos, including Californios, and the Chinese, but not any other foreign, but white Europeans, showing systematic racism on the part of the newly formed California Legislature.  Notable people  The Californio population was 10,000 in 1845, estimated. * Rosario E.

The Squatter and the Don (2nd ed.). Houston: Arte Publico Press The novel was based on the legal struggles of General Mariano G. Vallejo, a friend of the author. The novel depicts the legal process by which Californios were often \\"relieved\\" of their land. This process was long (most Californios spent up to 15 years defending their grants before the courts), and the legal fees were enough to make many Californios landless. Californios resented having to pay land taxes to United States officials, because the principle of paying taxes for land ownership did not exist in Mexican law. In some cases Californios had little available capital, because their economy had operated on a barter system; they often lost land because of the inability to pay the taxes.Pitt, Decline of the Californios, pp. 83‚Äì102 They could not compete economically with the European and Anglo-American immigrants who arrived in the region with large amounts of cash. * Alejandro Murgu√≠a (1949-) speaks of growing up in the 20th century playing in the ruins of Missions and his family history as Californios in The medicine of memory : a Mexica clan in California. A portrayal of Californio culture is depicted in the novel Ramona (1884), written by Helen Hunt Jackson. The fictional character of Zorro has become the most identifiable Californio due to novels, short stories, motion pictures and the 1950s television series. The historical facts of the era are sometimes lost in the story-telling.

(1976), \\"Is Logic Empirical?\\", in H. D. Lewis (ed.), Contemporary British Philosophy, 4th series (London: Allen and Unwin), pp. 45‚Äì68. Reprinted in M. Dummett, Truth and other Enigmas (London: Duckworth,1978), pp. 269‚Äì289 that discuss the idea that the algebraic properties of logic may, or should, be empirically determined; in particular, they deal with the question of whether empirical facts about quantum phenomena may provide grounds for revising classical logic as a consistent logical rendering of reality. The replacement derives from the work of Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann on quantum logic. In their work, they showed that the outcomes of quantum measurements can be represented as binary propositions and that these quantum mechanical propositions can be combined in much the same way as propositions in classical logic. However, the algebraic properties of this structure are somewhat different from those of classical propositional logic in that the principle of distributivity fails. The idea that the principles of logic might be susceptible to revision on empirical grounds has many roots, including the work of W. V. Quine and the foundational studies of Hans Reichenbach.Reichenbach, H., Philosophic Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, University of California Press, 1944. Reprinted by Dover 1998, W. V. Quine What is the epistemological status of the laws of logic? What sort of arguments are appropriate for criticising purported principles of logic? In his seminal paper \\"Two Dogmas of Empiricism,\\" the logician and philosopher W. V. Quine argued that all beliefs are in principle subject to revision in the face of empirical data, including the so-called analytic propositions. Thus the laws of logic, being paradigmatic cases of analytic propositions, are not immune to revision. To justify this claim he cited the so-called paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Birkhoff and von Neumann proposed to resolve those paradoxes by abandoning the principle of distributivity, thus substituting their quantum logic for classical logic. Quine did not at first seriously pursue this argument, providing no sustained argument for the claim in that paper. In Philosophy of Logic (the chapter titled \\"Deviant Logics\\"), Quine rejects the idea that classical logic should be revised in response to the paradoxes, being concerned with \\"a serious loss of simplicity\\", and \\"the handicap of having to think within a deviant logic\\". Quine, though, stood by his claim that logic is in principle not immune to revision. Hans Reichenbach Reichenbach considered one of the anomalies associated with quantum mechanics, the problem of complementary properties. A pair of properties of a system is said to be complementary if each one of them can be assigned a truth value in some experimental setup, but there is no setup which assigns a truth value to both properties. The classic example of complementarity is illustrated by the double-slit experiment in which a photon can be made to exhibit particle-like properties or wave-like properties, depending on the experimental setup used to detect its presence. Another example of complementary properties is that of having a precisely observed position or momentum. Reichenbach approached the problem within the philosophical program of the logical positivists, wherein the choice of an appropriate language was not a matter of the truth or falsity of a given language ‚Äì in this case, the language used to describe quantum mechanics ‚Äì but a matter of \\"technical advantages of language systems\\". His solution to the problem was a logic of properties with a three-valued semantics; each property could have one of three possible truth-values: true, false, or indeterminate. The formal properties of such a logical system can be given by a set of fairly simple rules, certainly far simpler than the \\"projection algebra\\" that Birkhoff and von Neumann had introduced a few years earlier. First article: Hilary Putnam Hilary Putnam In his paper \\"Is Logic Empirical?\\" Hilary Putnam, whose PhD studies were supervised by Reichenbach, pursued Quine's idea systematically. In the first place, he made an analogy between laws of logic and laws of geometry: at one time Euclid's postulates were believed to be truths about the physical space in which we live, but modern physical theories are based around non-Euclidean geometries, with a different and fundamentally incompatible notion of straight line. In particular, he claimed that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic for this reason: realism about the physical world, which Putnam generally maintains, demands that we square up to the anomalies associated with quantum phenomena. Putnam understands realism about physical objects to entail the existence of the properties of momentum and position for quanta. Since the uncertainty principle says that either of them can be determined, but both cannot be determined at the same time, he faces a paradox. He sees the only possible resolution of the paradox as lying in the embrace of quantum logic, which he believes is not inconsistent. Quantum logic The formal laws of a physical theory are justified by a process of repeated controlled observations. This from a physicist's point of view is the meaning of the empirical nature of these laws. The idea of a propositional logic with rules radically different from Boolean logic in itself was not new. Indeed a sort of analogy had been established in the mid-nineteen thirties by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann between a non-classical propositional logic and some aspects of the measurement process in quantum mechanics. Putnam and the physicist David Finkelstein proposed that there was more to this correspondence than a loose analogy: that in fact there was a logical system whose semantics was given by a lattice of projection operators on a Hilbert space. This, actually, was the correct logic for reasoning about the microscopic world. In this view, classical logic was merely a limiting case of this new logic. If this were the case, then our \\"preconceived\\" Boolean logic would have to be rejected by empirical evidence in the same way Euclidean geometry (taken as the correct geometry of physical space) was rejected on the basis of (the facts supporting the theory of) general relativity. This argument is in favour of the view that the rules of logic are empirical. That logic came to be known as quantum logic. There are, however, few philosophers today who regard this logic as a replacement for classical logic; Putnam himself may no longer hold that view. Quantum logic is still used as a foundational formalism for quantum mechanics: but in a way in which primitive events are not interpreted as atomic sentences but rather in operational terms as possible outcomes of observations. As such, quantum logic provides a unified and consistent mathematical theory of physical observables and quantum measurement. Second article: Michael Dummett Michael Dummett In an article also titled \\"Is Logic Empirical?,\\" Michael Dummett argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates distributivity: the principle of distributivity is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world, in just the same way as he argues the principle of bivalence is. To grasp why, consider why truth tables work for classical logic: first, it must be the case that the variable parts of the proposition are either true or false: if they could be other values, or fail to have truth values at all, then the truth table analysis of logical connectives would not exhaust the possible ways these could be applied. For example intuitionistic logic respects the classical truth tables, but not the laws of classical logic, because intuitionistic logic allows propositions to be other than true or false. Secondly, to be able to apply truth tables to describe a connective depends upon distributivity: a truth table is a disjunction of conjunctive possibilities, and the validity of the exercise depends upon the truth of the whole being a consequence of the bivalence of the propositions, which is true only if the principle of distributivity applies. Hence Putnam cannot embrace realism without embracing classical logic, and hence his argument to endorse quantum logic because of realism about quanta is a hopeless case. Dummett's argument is all the more interesting because he is not a proponent of classical logic. His argument for the connection between realism and classical logic is part of a wider argument to suggest that, just as the existence of particular class of entities may be a matter of dispute, so a disputation about the objective existence of such entities is also a matter of dispute. Consequently intuitionistic logic is privileged over classical logic, when it comes to disputation concerning phenomena whose objective existence is a matter of controversy. Thus the question, \\"Is Logic Empirical?,\\" for Dummett, leads naturally into the dispute over realism and anti-realism, one of the deepest issues in modern metaphysics.

Although a handsomely modeled vessel, numerous defects occasioned her sale in 1863. An agent of the Confederate States Government purchased her ostensibly for the China trade, but British authorities suspected she was destined to be a Confederate commerce raider and ordered her detention. Nevertheless, she succeeded in escaping from Sheerness, England, on November 24, with workmen still on board and only a token crew. Her Confederate States Navy officers joined in the English Channel. When he bought her from the Admiralty through his secret agent on November 14, Commander Matthew F. Maury had intended Rappahannock to replace the cruiser and was about to transfer Georgias guns to her. She was ideal for a cruiser -- wooden- hulled and bark-rigged with two engines and a lifting screw propeller. She was commissioned a Confederate man-of-war underway, but while passing out of the Thames Estuary her bearings burned out and she had to be taken across to Calais for repairs. There Lieutenant C. M. Fauntleroy, CSN, was placed in command. Detained on various pretexts by the French Government, Rappahannock never got to sea and was turned over to the United States at the close of the war.

In a normal pregnancy, an embryo would be visible on an ultrasound by six weeks after the woman's last menstrual period. Anembryonic gestation is one of the causes of miscarriage of a pregnancy. A blighted ovum or anembryonic gestation is characterized by a normal-appearing gestational sac, but the absence of an embryo. It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast. When small, the sac cannot be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy, as there may be a yolk sac, though a fetal pole is not seen. For diagnosis, the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established. The criteria depends on the type of ultrasound exam performed. A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) greater than 25 mm and no yolk sac, or an MGD >25 mm with no embryo. Transabdominal imaging without transvaginal scanning may be sufficient for diagnosing early pregnancy failure when an embryo whose crown‚Äìrump length is 15 mm or more has no visible cardiac activity.

Geographically it is part of a larger urban area consisting of the city of Kingston upon Hull, the town of Hessle and a number of other villages but is not part of the city. It is on the north bank of the Humber Estuary where the Humber Bridge crosses. According to the 2011 UK census, Hessle parish had a population of 15,000, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 14,767. Amenities The Square in January 2007 The centre of Hessle is the Square. There are many shops and a small bus station, which was refitted in 2007. Hessle All Saints' Church is located just off the Square and was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. Hessle Town Hall was built in 1897 and is situated at the top of South Lane. Hessle Police Station is next door to the town hall at the top of South Lane and the corner of Ferriby Road. Hessle is home to the world- famous Humber Bridge, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. At the time of its opening, the Humber Bridge was the world's longest single-span suspension bridge. It links Hessle to the town of Barton-upon-Humber on the opposite side of the river Humber. In July 2017 the bridge was granted Grade I listed status. History Workers shipbuilding in Hessle for the Royal Navy during the Second World War In more modern times, it has been a centre for shipbuilding. Before 1897, there was a shipyard building wooden boats, but it was then bought by Henry Scarr who moved there from Beverley, where he had previously been in partnership with his brother Joseph. Scarr produced iron and steel ships until 1932, when the yard was taken over by Richard Dunston. It was the largest shipyard in Hessle, building vessels such as Loch Riddon, a roll-on/roll-off ferry launched in 1986, and one of four built for Caledonian MacBrayne for use in the Hebrides. The company went into liquidation in 1987 and was bought by Damen Shipyards Group in the same year. Dunston's was closed down in 1994. The location is now used as offices, car sales buildings and a dock for scrap metal and other materials for dispatch to other areas, or to be recycled. Richard Dunston's ship repairs still exists further east along the Humber Estuary, with activity remaining high. Geography Hessle is surrounded by the neighbouring villages of Willerby, Anlaby, Kirk Ella, West Ella, North Ferriby and Swanland. Humber Bridge Country Park in December 2006 Chalk-quarrying was a major industry at Hessle into the 20th century and quarries can still be seen in the west of the town, the largest being the Humber Bridge Country Park, which is a popular tourist attraction. Part of it is known as Little Switzerland (Little Switz or Switzy for short). The Humber Bridge Country Park Local Nature Reserve was formerly a chalk quarry and was developed as a country park following the construction of the Humber Bridge. It consists of mixed species of woodland, wild flowers, a spring-fed pond and herb-rich grassland. The park can be explored on several well-signed walking routes. Hessle is twinned with the French town of Bourg-de-Thizy. Transport to and from Hessle is convenient, with good access to main roads such as the A15, A63 and M62 (via the A63). It also has a railway station with hourly services to and from Hull and to destinations such as Doncaster and York. Regular bus services provided by East Yorkshire link the town with the surrounding villages, Hull City Centre, Longhill Estate in east Hull as well as further afield towns including Brough and Beverley. Hessle is at the start of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, a long-distance footpath and designated National Trail, which crosses the Yorkshire Wolds and ends at Filey on the Holderness Coast. Education The site of the town's secondary school, Hessle High School & Sixth Form College, on Heads Lane, is centred on a building donated to the Education Authority by Algernon Henry Barkworth, a survivor of the RMS Titanic sinking. Hessle Sixth Form College is part of a consortium with secondary schools Wolfreton School (in Willerby) and Cottingham High School (in Cottingham), offering sixth form pupils a chance to attend classes at any of the three schools within the consortium. The entire school was reopened in January 2016, as part of Priority Schools Building Programme. Since January 2017, Penshurst Primary School and Hessle High School & Sixth Form College have been a through-school. Penshurst Primary School, for children aged 3‚Äì11, located on Winthorpe Road. Hessle is also home to All Saints' CE Federation of Academies Infant and Junior School, a Church of England school for children aged 3‚Äì11, located on Northolme Road. 2007 floods On 25 June 2007, torrential rain hit the north-east of England and 100 mm of rain fell in a few hours. Several people died across the affected area and the first fatality occurred in Hessle. A 28-year-old man became trapped when his foot was stuck in a storm drain. He was overwhelmed by rising water and although emergency services gave him oxygen he died of hypothermia. Sky News filmed the operation and broadcast some of the footage in the days after the event. They were criticised for this but responded that the victim's family had approved the broadcast. The floods caused the formation of a local residents association, HCARA (Hessle Community Action Residents Association) who worked with various bodies to campaign for improvements in defences against floods in the lower Hessle area. The local MP, Alan Johnson, as well as representatives of the Environment Agency, East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Flood Forum were among the speakers at the resident meetings. HCARA, having operated to facilitate the distribution of news to Hessle residents immediately after the 2007 floods, is currently dormant. As a result of consultation with the residents, the Environment Agency promoted a flood storage scheme which was constructed in a field off Beverley Road in Hessle from 2010‚Äì2011. The project known as a flood water attenuation scheme involved identifying a field immediately upstream of the urban area, this was then excavated below natural ground level to a depth of around 6 feet. A flow control structure was built on the downstream end of the watercourse and the bank of the Western Drain was lowered on the West Side. In a very heavy storm, when the capacity of the control structure is exceeded, water overflows into the storage area. After the storm, the (stored) water returns to the Western Drain through a small diameter land drainage pipe. The lagoon holds around 35,000 cubic metres of water. The storage area remains dry for the majority of the time and looks from the road side to be a paddock, albeit lower than surrounding fields. Hessle Feast Earliest found records of the Hessle Feast date from the 1800s. These have it as an annual event around Whitsuntide (May). A time of enjoyment, when the people of the parish would gather to celebrate the coming year. Hessle Feast in July 2006 From articles in 1808 and 1836, it is clear that the feast had become a major event bringing in people from neighbouring towns and villages. With much excitement, racing, noise and jubilee. As ever the youth made it their own. Even in the earliest reports, there are churchwardens concerns over noisy and drunken behaviour \\"particularly of the young men of Hull\\" who visited the parish. Resurrected around 15 years ago, after many years of absence, the feast has again become an event of enjoyment and embraced by the whole community of Hessle. Previous feasts include one which occurred in July 2006, which succeeded in attracting over 5,000 local residents and visitors to the area and was an entertaining day of charitable money raising, family fun and live music. The event hosted many activities such as a \\"Battle of the Bands\\" which took place on the main stage in the Square, a \\"Buskathon\\" centred down Prestongate, and local bands centred on a smaller stage on the Weir. There was also a boat race around the streets of Hessle, which was eventually won by army cadets carrying an inflatable float. The event was partly-funded and majorly sponsored by Kingston Communications and Yorkshire Water ‚Äì companies working in the area at the time. Hessle Feast returned, after a three-year absence due to the 2007 United Kingdom floods, in 2009. It was officially opened by the then Home Secretary, Hull West and Hessle MP, Alan Johnson, and the Mayor of Hessle, Frank Kitchen, at 1 p.m. The feast day in 2009 entertained crowds over a larger area than previous feasts, to encourage more business to the less immediate areas of Hessle. In the Square, the main stage starred the \\"Hessle's Got Talent\\" final and the \\"Crave and Serenity Fashion Show\\". The Square's stage was compared by KCFM DJ Dave Hudson. Prestongate had further stalls and barbecues. The Weir also had a stage with live music played all afternoon. On the feast day, a world record for \\"poppadom stacking\\" was broken on the Weir by the Indian takeaway Jolsha, officiated by the local MP Alan Johnson. Following on from the Weir is Tower Hill Park, which was mainly occupied by the army who had assault courses and climbing walls, which, as in previous years, focused on activities for the younger generations. The feast also reached the area near the library, which held a third stage with live local bands chosen by The Hase pub. The boat race was won by the youth sports team Norland Sharks, who were the fastest at running around Hessle carrying an inflatable boat. The Hessle Feast 2009 Committee was an independent body of unpaid volunteers that organised the event in the pubs of Hessle. The event was majorly sponsored by KCFM and Hull Colour Pages, with additional funding from the local town council. Tugboat \\"Englishman\\" at the Humber Bridge celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II on 4 June 2012 The 2012 Hessle Feast was timed to take place on the Sunday of the weekend of celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in June 2012. The following day, a waterborne procession of sailing and powered craft departed from Hessle and proceeded around the River Humber. Sport The most popular sport in Hessle is football. Hessle is home to three senior football clubs, Hessle Rangers, Hessle United, and Hessle Sporting, the latter of which plays in the Humber Premier League Premier Division ‚Äì level 13 on the English football league system pyramid. The clubs also have a large section of junior teams playing in the Hull Boys Sunday Football League. Also, there is a cricket team and a rugby team at the Hessle rugby club near the foreshore.

In The Undiscovered Country, Chang is Chancellor Gorkon's chief of staff, and subsequently serves Chancellor Azetbur. He is depicted as being an avid fan of William Shakespeare, whom he frequently quotes in the film, much to the chagrin of the Enterprise crew. The character is almost completely bald, a trait not seen among Klingons prior to Star Trek VIs release. The Chang makeup originally included a wig appliance. However, Christopher Plummer felt removing the wig made the character more distinct; he also asked that Chang's Klingon makeup be made less severe. Chang's attire is also unique in that an apparent eye injury is disguised with a metal eyepatch, which is attached directly to his skull by bolts bearing the Klingon emblem; later depictions of Klingons with eye injuries, such as Deep Space Nine's Martok, had them flaunting their mutilations as battle scars. Plummer's delivery of lines and depiction of this character has been praised in the Star Trek franchise. Overview In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Chang was a well-known Klingon general who believed that \\"in space all warriors are cold warriors.\\" Throughout the film, he was often depicted as fierce, cunning, and willing to participate in battles personally. Chang had a deep-seated hatred for the United Federation of Planets and believed that a war with them was inevitable. As a result, in the events described in the video game Star Trek: Klingon Academy, he created a simulated campaign against the Federation and used it to train students at an Academy for future starship commanders. This hatred eventually led him to participate in a conspiracy to thwart plans for a lasting peace between his people and the Federation. Between the years of 2291 and 2293 in the Star Trek universe, the general played a key role in two violent Klingon power struggles. The first was when a Klingon named Kalnor led an unsuccessful coup to depose the current Chancellor. Chang attacked and crippled Kalnor's ship, but he did not destroy it. Instead, he beamed himself aboard the enemy vessel and challenged Kalnor to single combat in front of his men. Chang killed Kalnor but lost his left eye in the fight. This resulted in the eye patch that he is seen wearing in The Undiscovered Country. The second conflict broke out after the Chancellor died. Kalnor's brother, Melkor, blocked the accession of Gorkon, the former chief of staff who was the legitimate successor. Melkor declared himself emperor and touched off a brutal civil war that had devastating consequences for the Klingon Empire, largely due to the usurper's treacherous and cowardly tactics. At one point, Melkor had a whole star system destroyed, rather than surrender it. He also had help from the Romulan Empire, another major power. Chang fought Melkor, but he did not support Gorkon. The two men were friends, but the general was wary of Gorkon's desire for a lasting peace with the Federation. As a result, Chang hoped to keep Gorkon from becoming the next leader of the Klingon Empire. However, Chang was eventually forced to accept help from Gorkon's forces. This led to a key victory against Melkor and his Romulan allies. It also meant that Chang was honor-bound to accept Gorkon as the new Klingon leader. Melkor was not finished. His supporters tried to trick Chang into thinking the Federation were invading. When the ruse was discovered, Chang had to make a choice: fight the fight he had waited for his whole life, or defend his people against the threat Melkor posed. He chose the latter, and Melkor was finally killed. During the events depicted in The Undiscovered Country, the Klingon Empire faced a momentous ecological disaster in 2293, when its key energy facility exploded and polluted the homeworld's atmosphere. This crisis had the potential to put an end to the Klingon Empire. Chang's worst fears came to life when Gorkon turned to the Federation for help. The Klingon Chancellor proposed putting an end to the cold war between the two powers and dismantling several outposts in the neutral zone between both powers. Rather than see this happen, Chang joined a secret conspiracy (which would be known as the Khitomer conspiracy) of Klingon, Federation, and Romulan officials to stop the peace process by any means necessary. The first step involved the creation of a secret warship (a Bird of Prey) with a unique ability; unlike other Klingon warships, it could fire its weapons while its cloaking device was enabled. As Gorkon's new chief of staff, Chang accompanied the Chancellor and his daughter, Azetbur, to meet with the Federation president. They were escorted through Federation space by the USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain James T. Kirk. An admirer of Kirk, Chang met him when Chang and his entourage were invited aboard the Enterprise for dinner. The Klingon general greeted Kirk as a \\"fellow warrior.\\" During the dinner, Chang inadvertently paraphrased Adolf Hitler with a comment about \\"breathing room,\\" which Kirk noted. After the Klingons returned to their ship, the conspirators struck. The modified Bird of Prey, invisible and near the Enterprise, attacked Gorkon's ship and made it look like the Federation ship was responsible. Then, two Starfleet conspirators beamed aboard Gorkon's ship, mortally wounded the Chancellor and killed several other Klingons. Chang accused Kirk of attacking them and then tried to launch a \\"counterattack\\" with Gorkon's ship. But instead, Kirk surrendered, and both he and the ship's doctor Leonard McCoy beamed aboard Gorkon's ship. Despite McCoy's efforts, Gorkon died and Chang arrested them both. (Despite his role in orchestrating Gorkon's death, Chang seemed genuinely affected by the death of his former comrade.) Gorkon's assassination was not enough to derail the peace process. The Federation President and Azetbur (who was the new Klingon Chancellor) were both determined to continue with it. The next meeting was set to take place at a neutral site, Camp Khitomer. The conspirators started to make plans to kill their next target: the Federation President. Meanwhile, Kirk and McCoy stood trial for Gorkon's murder. Chang prosecuted them both and succeeded in having them both found guilty. However, the judge commuted a death sentence and sent them both to the penal asteroid Rura Penthe. Not satisfied with this, Chang ordered the commandant of Rura Penthe to make sure Kirk and McCoy were killed during an escape attempt. However, Kirk and McCoy's escape succeeded. Kirk and McCoy were rescued by Enterprise. Knowing that his enemy would find out where the peace conference was, Chang took the modified Bird of Prey to Khitomer to wait for him. As Chang predicted, the Enterprise arrived and tried to achieve an orbit of Khitomer. Safe from enemy fire in his invisible ship, Chang taunted Kirk and his crew with Shakespearean quotes. The Bird of Prey fired one torpedo after another, causing massive damage to the Enterprise. Another Federation ship, the Excelsior, arrived to help, but Chang only fired at it as well. For Chang, victory seemed very near. The Enterprise was very close to being destroyed, followed by its companion ship. Suddenly, the Enterprise fired a torpedo. To Chang's surprise, the torpedo had been properly aimed at his supposedly invisible warship. The Enterprise had found a way to locate Chang's ship, by tracing its exhaust. Chang and his bridge crew were killed when a reconfigured gas-sampling torpedo hit. The Enterprise and Excelsior destroyed the Bird of Prey. Chang, realizing he was beaten, uttered his last Shakespeare quote: \\"To be, or not to be.\\" Members of the Enterprise crew were then able to transport to Khitomer and stop the conspirators from killing the Federation President. The resulting conference led to a peace that lasted almost a century ‚Äî exactly the thing that Chang was trying to prevent. = Reception = Time magazine rated General Chang the second best villain of the Star Trek franchise in 2016. In 2019, SyFy rated General Chang as the 8th greatest Klingon of the Star Trek franchise.SYFY It is a good day to die: Ranking the top ten Klingons in all of Star Trek Mar 7, 2019 In particular they note Plummer's brilliant delivery of lines, and an exceptional Klingon court scene with Captain Kirk (played by William Shatner) and Doctor McCoy (DeForrest Kelly).

The theme of the college, and the name of its freshman core course, is \\"cultural identities and global consciousness.\\" Location Merrill is located at the far northeastern corner of the University of California, Santa Cruz campus, east of Crown College and north of Cowell and Stevenson colleges. The college sits at the top of a hill and can only be reached by steep access roads and pedestrian paths. The grounds cover approximately nine acres of land (the smallest of the residential colleges) covered largely by tall redwood trees. History Merrill was founded in 1968 as the fourth college at UCSC. The college takes its name from Charles E. Merrill Jr., former Headmaster of the Commonwealth School in Boston. In 1968, Merrill was the chairman of the Charles E. Merrill Trust, named for his father, Charles E. Merrill, Sr., the founder of Merrill Lynch. It was in this year that the Trust elected to donate funds for the construction of the hitherto-named College Four at Santa Cruz. The first three colleges at UCSC all had clearly identified academic specialties before their founding: Cowell in the humanities, Stevenson in the social sciences, and Crown in the natural sciences. However, Merrill allowed its early faculty and students to determine its theme. The college originally intended to focus on international studies, but an early shift towards global poverty led to its eventual emphasis on the developing countries and their cultures, as well as the impact of the United States in the developing world. With a progressive theme, Merrill quickly attracted liberal and radical faculty and students. It offered ethnic studies classes as well as student housing with ethnic studies emphases, and attracted progressive visitors, including Herbert Marcuse in 1975. Merrill also gained a reputation as a campus center of openness and acceptance for gays and lesbians; in 1991 it established the Vito Russo House in one of its student residences. In 2003, as part of a campus-wide food service consolidation program, the Merrill dining hall closed and was converted into a multi-use space, called the Merrill Cultural Center. In 2006, the History Department, and many affiliated faculty, left their longtime home at Merrill for the new Humanities Building next to Cowell College. In 2014, Merrill College was renovated, updating the dorms to fire code standards and was remodeled. Architecture and buildings The Quad at Merrill College The San Francisco architectural firm Campbell and Wong designed the buildings at Merrill College. Most of the original structures were completed by 1970. The Crown- Merrill Apartments were added in 1986. Unlike the first colleges, Merrill does not consist of Bay Regionalist or Mediterranean buildings centered around formal quads. Instead, its structures present three key features: starkly modern and Scandinavian design, orientation around the redwood trees that once were the focal point of the site (removed in Spring 2013 for a redesign), and playfully historical components such as the bridges to the residential towers, balconies with lattice railings, and the bell tower above the dining hall. The college hosts a range of colors, rust red and off-white residence halls. Merrill prominently features blue metal roofs for nearly every building, with the exception of the two main residence towers. The Merrill circle, at the top of a driveway off McLaughlin Drive, is the formal entrance to the college. The college office and the academic buildings, with faculty offices, seminar rooms, and a lecture hall, are immediately behind the circle. Just below the main Academic Building are three smaller buildings. One contains the Charles E. Merrill Lounge, another is an annex of faculty offices and home to the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community; and lastly, the Casa Latina. The college activities office and Vivas Mexican Food, a Mexican restaurant based in midtown Santa Cruz, are in a small building at the center of the college, adjacent to a small courtyard in front of the former dining hall. Merrill has four primary residence halls. Lorde-Studds, Kochiyama, Bulosan and Gandhi- Kahlo House (usually referred to as \\"A Dorm\\" and \\"B Dorm\\" respectively) are in two large, five-story buildings that close a loose square with the dining hall and academic buildings. Two smaller houses, Chavez-Menchu and DuBois (C and D), are located to the East of the college circle and Ming Ong computer lab. Near the college are buildings housing the Lionel Cant√∫ GLBTI Resource Center, KZSC radio, and the campus Peace Corps office. The Crown-Merrill apartments are located across a ravine from the main college. Most Merrill freshmen reside in the residence halls, with most sophomores in the college apartments. Upper-division students generally live off-campus. There is also the Merrill and Alan Chadwick gardens on Garden Ct. Beginning Spring of 2013, a major redesign of the Merrill quad and residence halls was underway. The first stages of the construction involved the removal of dozens of redwood trees that had formerly given the location is distinctively sylvan quality. Academic emphases Merrill remains a campus center for studies of the developing world and cultural studies. Its freshman core course includes readings by authors from Cuba, Morocco, inner-city Los Angeles, and most recently Darfur. In particular, it houses many faculty in Spanish language and Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS). Both the LALS academic offices and the Casa Latina library and resource center are housed in the Merrill academic buildings. Merrill College also houses the faculty and administrative offices of the Politics Department and the Legal Studies Program. Core course The core course is called \\"Cultural Identities and Global Consciousness\\" (MERR 80A, 80B). It is one quarter long and students read around four novels, usually memoirs, one of which is replaced every year by a new one. Programs Merrill has the only pottery co-op in the Santa Cruz colleges. It also offers opportunities to volunteer in local elementary schools. Merrill is home to the Merrill Student Government (MSG): one of the most active student governments at UCSC, the Merrill Activities Council: a group for students to come together and plan programs and events for the Merrill Community, and annually hosts the most highly attended dances on the UCSC campus including \\"Moat Jam\\" (the kickoff dance for each academic year), the annual Halloween Dance and \\"Glitterball\\" (the kickoff to the Universities month of LGBT pride events) Traditions The Merrill moat, created by a retaining wall adjacent to the large college dormitories, features murals by Merrill students. Every spring, Merrill students decide which murals should remain and which should be painted over with new artwork. After the new murals are chosen, students gather on a weekend to help paint the new murals at an event called Merrill Moat Day. Along with painting over the old murals and starting the new ones, the even includes activities put on by the RA's (Residential Assistants) and a barbecue for Merrill Students. In the past, activities like henna tattoos, tie dyeing t-shirts, and other arts and crafts have been featured. Merrill also hosts a campus-wide dance in the moat at the beginning of each academic year, called Moat Jam. It usually takes place on the Sunday evening of Welcome Week.

The company was awarded three Order of Lenin decorations by the Soviet Union. Its Lomo LC-A consumer camera was the inspiration for the lomography photographic movement. History Lubitel 166 Universal twin-lens reflex 120 still camera LOMO LC-A The company was founded in 1914 in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). It was established as a French ‚Äì Russian limited company to produce lenses and cameras. It manufactured gun sights during World War I. In 1919, it was nationalised. In the ensuing years, the state optical industries were reorganised several times. In 1921, the factory was named the Factory of State Optics, G.O.Z. In 1925, camera production was resumed, and several lens designs tested between 1925 and 1929. In 1928, the factory was ordered to manufacture a 9x12 camera, known as the FOTOKOR. Further reorganisations of the Soviet optical factories in several stages finally resulted in that the factory at Leningrad became GOMZ, the Russian Optical and Mechanical Factory. In the transition period 1932 to 1935 a copy of the Leica camera was developed, the VOOMP I. It was followed by the VOOMP II or the \\"Pioneer\\" that was manufactured in small numbers. Simultaneously designers began the development of a single-lens reflex camera for 35mm cine film, possibly inspired by similar work in Germany, especially at Zeiss Ikon in Dresden, since the lens mount is quite similar to that of the Contax cameras of the time. Zeiss themselves were not allowed to pursue their ideas, due to the German armament. The new camera, called the \\"Sport\\", was introduced at about the same time as the Ihagee Kine Exakta in 1936. Today LOMO makes military optics, scientific research instruments, criminological microscopes, medical equipment, and a range of consumer products. It produced the first Russian camera in 1930. Known as GOMZ (State Optical-Mechanical Plant), the company was transformed under the direction of Mikhail Panfilov, who united several industries and founded the LOMO Association in 1962. Panfilov was the General Director until 1984, when he retired and was replaced by Georgy Khizha as Director General. In 1990 - 1997 Ilya Klebanov was the Director General of LOMO Association. Amateur movie equipment brands were LOMO and AVRORA for cameras and Russ for projectors. Ritm is also used after LOMO for professional sound equipment. It produced the one and only Super 8 sound camera and projector in the USSR. It was also the main Soviet producer for professional grade cine lenses, including anamorphic lenses. The company went public in 1993, and was renamed LOMO PLC; it is traded on the RTS Classic Stock Market. The company is ISO 9001 certified and exports worldwide. Night- vision devices and telescopes account for 30% of the company's exports. Germany is the largest importer of LOMO products. Medical equipment, fiber optic cables and Endoscopes, optical components and cameras are consumed mainly by the Russian market and other states of the former Soviet Union. Military equipment and science research instruments make a significant share of production for export to such countries as Israel, India, United States, Canada, Mexico, and other international markets. Its Maksutov telescope range is highly regarded by amateur astronomers. The word LOMO is often used to refer to the Lomo LC-A and other LOMO branded consumer cameras; while the cameras have a large following around the world, the cameras themselves are a minor product for LOMO PLC. LOMO is also currently a manufacturer of die-cast models in 1:43 scale. LOMO factory mass-produces 1:43 scale models of the 1930s-1950s vehicles on AMO, ZiS, ZiL and GAZ chassis. Social standing LOMO is regarded in St. Petersburg for its advanced medical centre, with well equipped facilities for advanced treatment of a range of medical conditions. LOMO medical centre has a steady reputation in general surgery and trauma, oncology and radiology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, physical therapy and other specialties of medicine. Medical instruments, such as Endoscopes and Surgical Microscopes made by LOMO are used by the doctors at LOMO medical centre, thus providing prompt feedback from doctors to engineers and designers of medical equipment.

History Rachel Carson College was founded in 1972 as College Eight at the current location of the Kerr Hall lecture building. Before it moved to its present location in 1990, College Eight was the only UCSC college that did not have its own on-campus housing; residential students were then housed at the Porter College residence halls. At the time, its focus was on transfer students, who are usually less likely to live on campus than students on a traditional four-year course.

As of Fall 2006, the new residence hall names are Hague House, Gandhi House, and Geneva House. These names however are temporary names and are subject to change once the college finds a benefactor. In the LRDP (Long Range Development Plan) for UCSC, Colleges 9 and 10 will be situated as the very center of UCSC by 2025. College Nine is also home to the International Living Center (ILC). The ILC is home to nearly a third of international students visiting UCSC while on study abroad and provides a space where international, transfer and domestic students coexist in apartment-style living. There also exists three International RAs as well as its own Coordinator for Residential Education.

College Ten is home to the University Center, a conference center located above the College Nine and Ten Dining Commons, and the Terry Freitas cafe, a student-run co-op cafe named after UCSC-alumni Terry Freitas, who was murdered in Colombia due to his work with the U'wa people to stop oil companies from drilling on U'wa land. In 2010, students and staff worked together to name the three residential halls. They are called Angela Davis House, after the American political activist and UCSC professor, Angela Davis; Ohlone House, after the native Ohlone people who are indigenous to the region; and Amnesty House, after Amnesty International and their work for human rights. The construction of Colleges Nine and Ten in 1992 caused a furor among students, as the planned construction site called for the destruction of a region of forest known as Elfland. Rife with unique student-built fantasy structures, the demolition of most of Elfland sparked student protests, resulting in several arrests . College Ten was founded in 2002, making it the newest UCSC college as of May 2017. It is one of two residential colleges, along with College Nine, that are as yet unnamed. College Ten and College Nine are in physical proximity, with a shared central dining hall. University of California, Santa Cruz students (including those associated with either College Nine or College Ten), as well as university staff, generally refer to both Colleges as \\"College Nine and Ten\\". There is currently very little to distinguish one from the other: they have identical architecture, are in close proximity to each other, are both associated with the Social Science Buildings, and their core course themes have many similarities. The College Nine and College Ten residence halls and shared dining hall opened in fall 2002. Nine and Ten hold few events that are solely for one college or the other.

He was a natural baritone; though he was known for his high-pitched vocals with Serpent's Knight and on the first two Sanctuary albums, later in his career, Dane became more notable for his distinctively deep, dramatic voice. Musical career Dane at Wacken Open Air 2014 Dane was trained for five years as an opera singer and utilized a very broad vocal range, spanning from notes as low as the G below low C, or G1, to notes as high as the B below soprano C, or B5. While his high head voice style vocals were much more prominent in the older Sanctuary albums, there were instances where he utilized it in Nevermore as well. Sanctuary's 2014 comeback album The Year the Sun Died includes these higher passages on three songs. Dane provided the voice of Candynose Twinskins in the musical comedy Metalocalypse on Adult Swim. Dane's first ever solo record, Praises to the War Machine was released May 13, 2008, on Century Media Records. He was working on a second album at the time of his death. It was going to be different than the first solo effort: \\"Some of it is just brutally heavy\\", Dane remarked. In March 2016, the title was revealed to be Shadow Work The recording session was originally planned for October 2016. Influences Dane's musical influences were Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Jefferson Airplane, Simon & Garfunkel, The Beatles, and The Doors, while Ronnie James Dio, Rob Halford, George Strait and Bruce Dickinson were his main vocal inspirations. Death On December 13, 2017, it was reported that Dane had died of a heart attack in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, at the age of 56. It was there that he was working on his second solo album. The guitarist of Dane's solo band Johnny Moraes stated that, \\"He died in the night. He had a heart attack. He was in the apartment where he stayed during the recording of the album when it happened. I gave him cardiac massage and we called the Mobile Emergency Care Service (SAMU), who came very fast, but when they arrived, he was already dead.\\" Moraes stated that Dane was already facing a lot of health issues due to a history of alcoholism and diabetes mellitus type 2.  Legacy  On January 14, 2018, one month after Dane's passing, the Brazilian movie director Daney Carvalho released his debut short film O Ano em que o Sol Morreu (a reference to the title of the Sanctuary album The Year the Sun Died), a drama and a tribute to Warrel Dane, on YouTube. The movie was originally released in May 2016 as part of a Brazilian festival, but the director chose to make it publicly available after the singer's death. Dane himself met with Carvalho that year, when the independent director interviewed him for a local Brazilian TV program during college. According to Carvalho, Dane was given a private screening of the movie after he finished post-production and thought it was \\"great\\" and \\"terrifying\\".

He was the fourth signatory of the Dogme95 movement. His feature films as director include Et skud fra hjertet, The King is Alive, The Intended, Fear Me Not, and The Salvation. Early life Kristian Levring was born in 1957 in Denmark. He later became a graduate of the National Film School of Denmark. Career Kristian Levring began his career as a documentarian, editing a number of feature-length documentaries and Danish-language feature films during the first two decades of his time as a filmmaker. He also worked as a director for television commercials. His first feature film he directed was Et skud fra hjertet (Shot from the Heart), released in 1986. Kristian Levring was the fourth signatory of the Dogme95 movement, however moved away from this style towards the end of the aughts. He co-signed the original manifesto in 1995 alongside Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, and S√∏ren Kragh-Jacobsen. In 2008, Levring and the other Dogme 95 founders were honoured with the Achievement in World Cinema award at the European Film Awards. =The King is Alive= Levring released the film The King is Alive in 2000. The Guardian describes the film as following, \\"bus passengers stranded in the Namibian desert, who decide to stage their own private performance of King Lear to pass the time until help arrives.\\" The passengers are stranded in an abandoned mining town in the middle of the Sahara. The film utilized Lear as a foil for European society reaching a terminal crisis. The words of Lear are used to further show the disintegration of the group into chaos under the pressure of their stranding. While one of the members is sent on a five-day journey to get help, the social relationships that Levring explores among those that stay behind include gender, marital, and the racial elements of the relationship between the passengers and the bus driver. The film was named an Official Selection at the Cannes Film Festival upon its premiere. The film has many elements in line with the Dogme95 cinematic beliefs, including placing film as a post-apocalyptic art form. Jan Simons wrote that, \\"The King is Alive allows us to see Dogma 95 in actu, as it were. With no decor and no costumes, in the natural light of the sun's glare, and with no recourse to the technical resources of theatre, the amateur actors study their roles; Henry writes everybody's lines out by hand, from memory.\\" Referencing to the rules of Dogma 95 are also found throughout the film. The New York Times wrote of Levring's work on the film that, > \\"Mr. Levring's vision of hell is vivid and stark but -- thanks to that > empty, endless desert -- touched with a pictorial sublimity rarely attempted > within the constraints of the Dogma aesthetic. The unsparing, invasive > naturalism of digital video, which seems specially calibrated to register > the play of anxiety and distress on human faces, also records an inhuman > landscape of undulating dunes and blinding sky. The juxtaposition creates a > sense of loneliness and panic, a stomach-turning dread that makes the > survival instinct look almost comically > weak.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E07EFD7133BF932A25756C0A9679C8B63 =The Intended= In 2002, Levring co-wrote and directed The Intended. The film follows two British expatriates and their lives in a remote Asian ivory trading station during the early 1900s, where the small community falls apart under the pressures of the foreign lands and daily struggles to survive.https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9407E1D91F39F936A15755C0A9629C8B63 The film has been described as, \\"an expressionistic and densely textured revisitation of The Heart of Darkness in the jungles of Malaysia.\\" The film opened at the Toronto International Film Festival. =Fear Me Not= In 2008 Levring directed Fear Me Not. The film explores the issues of prescription medication on the psychology of families, following the protagonist as they try the use of antidepressants to cure his malaise stemming from workoholism. The protagonist soon becomes paranoid and starts to fear his spouse. The plot is reminiscent of the narrative of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the rights were sold to IFC. The film also opened at the Toronto International Film Festival. =The Salvation= Levring's western film titled The Salvation, starred Mads Mikkelsen and was screened at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it became an Official Selection. Levring filmed the movie in South Africa, setting it in the American frontier. The story follows the character Jon, a Danish \\"ex- soldier who moved to the States after losing to the Germans on the battlefield in 1864,\\" according to Variety. Levring has stated that during this era, about half of all people on the American frontier did not speak English, which was the entry-point for him to produce a film about the American west. In developing the film, Levring used both Western films and Nordic mythology as inspiration. In an interview with Reader's Digest, Levring stated of the film's subject matter that, \\"You could see the Western frontier as the beginning of civilization, and I‚Äôm very interested in the nature of civilization. Often these places are a microscope: you can look at these characters and see how they behave in quite extreme situations. Civilization is quite a thin varnish, and when you take that away it‚Äôs interesting to see what happens.\\" Levring both cowrote and directed the film.

He was the son of a Royal Irish Constabulary policeman. Four years later, Thomas Barry Senior resigned and opened a business in his hometown of Rosscarbery, County Cork. Barry was educated for a period at Mungret College, County Limerick from 25 August 1911 to 12 September 1912. The reason for his short stay is indicated by a reference from the school register of the Apostolic School, Mungret College; 'Went‚ÄìHome (ran away) without knowledge of superiors ‚Äì no vocation'.Irish Jesuit Archives, School Register of Apostolic School, Mungret College, p. 66  World War I  In 1915, during Ireland's involvement in World War I, he enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery at Cork and became a soldier in the British Army. Barry enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery on 30 June 1915 and was sent to the military depot at Athlone for basic training. After six months he was posted to the Mesopotamian front (modern Iraq) on 21 January 1916.History Ireland, Guerilla Days in Iraq, September/October 2008, by Mark McLoughlin He fought from January 1916 in Mesopotamia (then part of the Ottoman Empire). On 1 March he was raised to the rank of corporal.COUGHLAN VC Day Speech In April while his brigade was attempting to break the Turkish Siege of Kut where the British after heavy losses were forced to surrender, Barry first heard of the Easter Rising. Presumably, in reaction to the British response to the Rising, Barry dropped his rank in protest on 26 May and reverted to his original rank of gunner, which rank he held until the end of the war.Bunbury, Turtle: The Glorious Madness, Tales of The Irish and The Great War, Gunner Tom Barry and the Siege of Kut; p. 272, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 12 (2014) From January 1917 until March 1918 he saw further action south of Kut, where his unit suffered heavy casualties, and also at Fallujah, Samarra and Baquba.History Ireland, Guerilla Days in Iraq, September/October 2008, by Mark McLoughlin In May 1918 his division was moved to the Egyptian front for the campaign in Palestine. Barry, however, remained in Egypt from June 1918 until February 1919, when he was shipped back to Ireland.History Ireland, Guerilla Days in Iraq, September/October 2008, by Mark McLoughlin Barry had some minor disciplinary issues in the Army, being punished on a number of occasions for being late for parade and disrespectful to NCOs.History Ireland, Guerilla Days in Iraq, September/October 2008, by Mark McLoughlin Nevertheless, when officially discharged from the army on 7 April 1919 Barry was described as a sober, good, hardworking man.Bunbury, Turtle: p. 273 War of Independence On his return to Bandon in Co Cork he first began to study Law and Business Affairs, while at the same time maintaining friendship with local ex- servicemens' organisations and building connections to the Irish republican movement. Initially Barry seemed proud of his wartime British Army service and hoisted a Union flag at Bandon on the first anniversary of the war's end in November 1919. For this reason he was distrusted by some local republicans, particularly Tom Hales.Meda Ryan, the Tom Barry Story, p17 It was only in July 1920 that the capture and torture of the republican volunteers Tom Hales and Pat Harte so appalled him that he immediately went to join the 3rd (West) Cork BrigadeBunburry, Turtle: p.273 of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which was then engaged in the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921). Having overcome the suspicion he could be a spy, helped by the fact that Tom Hales had been arrested and replaced as Brigade commander by Charlie Hurley, by late summer he was their intelligence officer.Bunburry, Turtle: p. 273 Barry was initially highly valued by the IRA for his military experience and his ability to train their own raw volunteers.Peter Hart, The IRA and its Enemies, p. 30‚Äì32 At this time the IRA's guerrilla tactics were taking shape and small groups of dedicated guerrillas were being organised and trained. Barry participated in four training campsTom Barry, The reality of the Anglo-Irish war, 1920-21 in West Cork, p22 and two attacks on British forces in the autumn of 1920 ‚Äì the Fanlobus ambush on 9 October and the Tooreen Ambush on 22 October, at the latter of which he commanded a section. He also tried, with Charlie Hurley, to assassinate a number of local police and judicial officials.Hart, The IRA and its Enemies, p32 The Kilmichael memorial However Barry soon came to command the West Cork Brigade's flying column and definitively made his name as a guerrilla commander at the Kilmichael Ambush on 28 November 1920, a turning point of the war, in which a company of 18 Auxiliaries was wiped out at the cost three IRA killed.Tom Barry Guerilla Days in Ireland, p44-45 The British alleged that Barry's men killed wounded and surrendering Auxiliaries and mutilated their corpses ‚Äì a charge that Barry always denied, claiming that he had ordered that no prisoners be taken after the Auxiliaries faked a surrender resulting in the death of some of his men.Barry, Guerilla Days p. 44-51. For the ongoing debate about Kilmichael see Kilmichael Ambush#Controversy Crossbarry, County Cork. In March 1921, 104 Irish Republican Army volunteers under the command of Tom Barry attacked and later escaped from an encircling manoeuvre by 1,200 British soldiers and Black and Tans. Barry was hospitalised for a time after the Kilmichael action and martial law was proclaimed in County Cork and across much of the province of Munster in response. However, in December the column regrouped, attacking a number of police and military barracks and ambushing a British military patrol at Burgatia House in February 1921.Barry Guerilla Days pp 70-86 The column, which was around 30‚Äì40 strong, dispersed shortly afterwards into smaller units and in this time lost 11 men killed. Three men died at the Upton Train Ambush and seven more were arrested and shot in separate incidents by British forces.Barry, Guerilla Days, p97 In March 1921 Barry mobilised his largest guerrilla force; 104 men, divided into seven sections, and at the Crossbarry Ambush broke out of an encirclement of 1,200 strong British force from the Essex Regiment. At least ten British soldiers were killed in the action along with three IRA Volunteers including Brigade commander Charlie Hurley.Barry, Guerilla Days, p 130, for British losses, Hart, IRA and its Enemies p. 321 In total, the British Army stationed over 12,500 troops in County Cork during the conflict, while Barry's men numbered no more than 310. Eventually, Barry's tactics made West Cork ungovernable for the British authorities except by military means. In the late spring and early summer of 1921, the British forces mounted large sweeps of the West Cork area, complete with aerial surveillance and armoured vehicles, forcing Barry's column to spend much of their time 'on the run' in mountainous terrain to avoid them. While they did avoid being encircled they were able to mount only one more major attack, which was on Rosscarbery police barracks in early April 1921.Barry, Guerilla Days, pp. 133‚Äì141, 152‚Äì153 and 193‚Äì201 Barry's ability as a guerrilla commander was widely acknowledged in the IRA and in the early summer of 1921 he was summoned to Dublin to meet with IRA leader Michael Collins and President of the Irish Republic √âamon de Valera. He also participated in the formation of the IRA First Southern Division, in which he was made Deputy Commander.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry IRA Freedom Fighter, p 135 Barry openly admitted in his memoir to taking a hard line on people he believed were collaborators with the British forces. He stated that his unit shot dead 16 civilians accused of informing in the first six months of 1921.Barry, Guerilla Days, p105 While he acknowledged that 9 of the 16 killings were Protestants, who were a minority in West Cork, he maintained that they were killed for no other reason than for their aid to British forces. He maintained, 'The majority of the West Cork Protestants lived at peace throughout the entire struggle and were not interfered with by the IRA'.Barry, Guerilla Days, p113 Barry also stated that his unit burned the houses of local loyalists in retaliation for the British burning of republicans' homes and carried out reprisal killings of captured and off duty British soldiers in response to the execution of IRA Volunteers.Barry, Guerilla Days, p116 The war in rural Cork was abruptly ended with truce negotiated to come into effect on 11 July 1921. At this time the West Cork flying column was, with other IRA units, in a training camp in the mountains along the Cork/Kerry border. Barry recalled his initial reaction as 'dazed and uncertain of the future' but relief that the 'days of fear were ended, at least for a time'.Barry, Guerilla Days, p. 227 He claimed that his unit had killed over 100 British troops and wounded another 93 during the conflict.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter, p 139 Barry later wrote of the period; Civil War During the negotiations that preceded the Truce that ended the war, the British had demanded that Barry be handed over to them before progress could be made on other matters. Michael Collins refused, although he afterwards jokingly told his fellow Cork men that he had been sorely tempted. During the truce period, Barry married Leslie Mary Price, who was herself a republican activist. Barry opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 6 December 1921, because, according to him, it betrayed the Irish Republic and partitioned Ireland. In March 1922 he participated in an IRA convention which disavowed the authority of the D√°il to approve the Treaty and was elected onto the anti-Treaty IRA's executive. In March 1922 he and his men occupied barracks in Limerick in defiance of the new Irish Free State government, and it looked as if fighting would break out until Liam Lynch IRA Chief of Staff arrived and defused the situation.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry IRA Freedom Fighter, p. 154 In May 1922 he, Rory O'Connor and Ernie O'Malley seized a convoy of arms intended for the new Free State police force and drove it to the anti-Treaty IRA headquarter in the Four Courts in Dublin.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry IRA Freedom Fighter, p. 154 On 28 June 1922 the Irish Civil War formally broke out between pro and anti-Treaty factions when Free State forces opened fire on the Four Courts. Barry was captured with 180 others when the Courts surrendered and was imprisoned by the Irish Free State in Mountjoy Gaol after the Battle of Dublin in July 1922. Barry had voiced the opinion that, at the start of the Civil War, while the Republican side was stronger, they should have taken over Dublin and the major cities and forced a new confrontation with the British. In September of that year, however, he escaped from an internment camp at Gormanston in County Meath and traveled south, to take command of the anti- Treaty IRA Second Southern Division. Barry returned to his previous role of guerrilla commander, leading a column of around 200 men based in West Cork. In mid December 1922, he led his men in the capture of a string of towns across the province of Munster, including Carrick on Suir, Thomastown and Mullinavat, killing two Irish National Army soldiers and taking the Free State garrisons there, amounting to over 110 men, prisoner and taking their arms. However, due to a shortage of men and equipment, he was unable to hold these places, evacuating them before National Army reinforcements arrived.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry IRA Freedom Fighter, p. 173‚Äì186 Withdrawing to the rugged country on the Cork/Kerry border, his column and Kerry IRA units (a total of about 65 men) mounted an assault on Millstreet early in 1923, failing to take the town, but killing two Free State soldiers and taking 39 prisoner.Michael Harrington, The Munster Republic, p. 110‚Äì112 However, as 1923 went on, Barry found his column increasingly weakened by casualties and arrests. By February 1923, Barry increasingly argued with Liam Lynch, the Republican commander in chief, that the Civil War should be brought to an end, as there was no hope of victory. In March, Barry proposed to the IRA Army executive that a ceasefire should be called, but he was defeated by 6 votes to 5. The anti-treaty campaign was belatedly called off by Frank Aiken in May, after Lynch had been killed in a skirmish with Free State troops, whereupon Aiken issued an order to 'dump arms'. Barry tried to act as intermediary with the pro-Treaty Irish Republican Brotherhood to end the civil war and for a time had a letter from the Free State authorities granting him 'immunity from arrest'. This caused him to fall out with other members of the IRA Army Council.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry IRA Freedom Fighter, p189-198 Nevertheless, the Free State government never formally acknowledged the end of the civil war marked by the republicans' ceasefire and dump arms order. Barry had to remain on the run until a general amnesty was declared in November 1924.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry IRA Freedom Fighter, p. 200 The Third Cork IRA Brigade, of which Barry commanded the Active Service Unit or flying column lost 34 men killed in the war against the British and another 21 anti-Treatyites killed in the civil war ‚Äì a total of 55, excluding pro-Treaty Volunteers who died in the civil war whom Barry did not record in his memoir.Barry, Guerilla Days, p236-238 Subsequent IRA career After the defeat of the Anti-Treaty IRA in the Civil War, according to historian Brian Hanley, Tom Barry proposed that the IRA hand over its arms to prevent further bloodshed between Irish nationalists. When the IRA Army Council rejected this, he left the organisation in late 1923. He rejoined the IRA in 1932.http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary- history/tom-barry/ However Barry's biographer Meda Ryan disputes this, claiming that Barry only resigned from the IRA leadership in 1923 but remained a rank and file member and reassuming a leadership role in 1932.http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/tom- barry-2/ He served as general superintendent of Cork Harbour Commission from 1927 to 1965. He initially proposed cooperation of the IRA and Fianna F√°il, the party led by erstwhile republican leader √âamon de Valera, especially against the Blueshirts, a militant movement born out of pro-Treaty civil war veterans. However De Valera banned both the IRA and the Blueshirts and Barry was imprisoned from May to December 1934 for arms possession.Ryan, Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter p. 212 In March 1936 Barry was involved in the shooting dead of Vice-Admiral Henry Somerville. Four men burst into Somerville's family home at Castletownshend, Cork and fired a revolver.The Times, Vice-Admiral Shot Dead Outrage In County Cork 25 March 1936Peter Hart, ‚ÄòBarry, Thomas Bernardine (1897‚Äì1980)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 Somerville was targeted for recruiting local men to join the Royal Navy. In 1937, he succeeded Se√°n MacBride as chief of staff. Barry claimed that they had sabotaged a planned IRA offensive in Northern Ireland. Barry would assert in later life that he opposed both the 1930s bombing campaign in England and IRA contacts with Nazi Germany. In fact, in January 1937 he had taken a trip to Germany seeking German support, which was assured to him subject to the condition that the IRA limit its actions to British military installations once war was declared. Financing was to be arranged through the Clann na Gael in the USA. The Army Convention in April 1938 adopted Se√°n Russell's S-Plan instead. Barry resigned as chief of staff as a result, but remained in contact with German agents at least to February 1939.Hull, Mark; Irish Secrets; Dublin 2003; ; S 47 In 1940, Barry was made responsible for Intelligence in the Irish Army's Southern Command, a position he held, with the rank of Commandant, for the duration of World War II (see The Emergency). In 1941 he was denounced by the IRA for writing for the Irish Army's journal, \\"An Cosant√≥ir\\". He was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1946 Cork Borough by-election. Barry was supportive of the Provisional IRA campaign but expressed reservations about some of their tactics. Memoir Cover of 1968 edition of Barry's memoir In 1949, Barry published his memoirs of the Irish War of Independence, Guerilla Days in Ireland. It describes his Brigade's activities such as the ambushes at Kilmichael and Crossbarry, as well as numerous other less known actions which were directed against the British Army, Black and Tans, the Auxiliary Division and the Royal Irish Constabulary. It became regarded as a classic account of the war and has been an influential guide to guerrilla warfare. Barry took part in a fiftieth anniversary commemoration of Kilmichael on 9 August 1970. It was later republished by Rena Dardis and Anvil Press. Death He died in a Cork hospital in 1980 and was survived by his wife, Leslie de Barra (n√©e Price), whom he married in 1921 and who was the director of organization for Cumann na mBan and later President of the Irish Red Cross, Price played a major role in the Easter Rising, and was in fact one of the last women to leave the GPO. She died in 1984. Barry is buried in St Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork. Tom Barry in popular culture * Bobby Sands wrote a poem about Barry after his death, entitled Tom Barry.

Agricultural biodiversity is a sub-set of general biodiversity. Otherwise known as agrobiodiversity, agricultural biodiversity is a broad term that includes \\"the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels that sustain the ecosystem structures, functions and processes in and around production systems, and that provide food and non-food agricultural products.‚Äù Created and managed by farmers, pastoralists, fishers and forest dwellers, agrobiodiversity provides stability, adaptability and resilience and constitutes a key element of the livelihood strategies of rural communities throughout the world. Agrobiodiversity is central to sustainable food systems and sustainable diets. The use of agricultural biodiversity can contribute to food security, nutrition security, and livelihood security, and it is critical for climate adaptation and climate mitigation. History of the term It is not clear when exactly the term agrobiodiversity was coined nor by whom. The 1990 annual report of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR, now Bioversity International) is one of the earliest references to biodiversity in the context of agriculture. Most references to agricultural biodiversity date from the late 1990s onwards. While similar, different definitions are used by different bodies to describe biodiversity in connection with food production. CGIAR tends to use agricultural biodiversity or agrobiodiversity, while the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) uses 'biodiversity for food and agriculture' and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) uses the term 'agricultural diversity'. The CBD more or less (but not entirely) excludes marine aquatic organisms and forestry in its usage because they have their own groups and international frameworks for discussion of international policies and actions. Decision V/5 of the CBD provides the framing description.  Levels of agrobiodiversity  = Genetic diversity = thumbrightDiversity of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) near harvest, with quinoa farmer, in Cachilaya, Bolivia, Province La Paz Genetic diversity refers to the variety and variability within and between species. It can refer to the naturally occurring genetic variability within and between populations of a species, for example wild relatives of food crops, or to the variability created by humans, for example farmer-developed traditional crop varieties called landraces, or commercially bred varieties of a crop (e.g. different apple varieties: Fuji, Golden Delicious, Golden Pippin, etc.). There is considerable genetic diversity within all food crop species, particularly in centres of origin, which are the geographical areas where species were originally developed. For example, the Andean region of Peru is a centre of origin for certain tuber species, and over 1,483 varieties of these species can be found there. Genetic diversity is important as different genes give rise to important traits, such as nutrient composition, hardiness to different environments, resistance to pests, or ample harvests. Genetic diversity is decreasing due to agricultural modernization, changing land use and climate change, among other factors. Genetic diversity is not static but is constantly evolving in response to changes in the environment and according to human intervention, whether farmers or breeders. Neglected and underutilized crop species in Benin = Species diversity = Species diversity refers to the number and abundance of different species used for food and agriculture. The number of species considered to contribute to food alone ranges from 5,538 to 75,000 depending on definitions. A conservative estimate is that about 6,000 species are commonly used for food. Species diversity includes \\"the domesticated plants and animals that are part of crop, livestock, forest or aquaculture systems, harvested forest and aquatic species, the wild relatives of domesticated species, and other wild species harvested for food and other products. It also encompasses what is known as ‚Äúassociated biodiversity‚Äù, the vast range of organisms that live in and around food and agricultural production systems, sustaining them and contributing to their output.\\" Agriculture is understood to include crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture. Aquatic diversity is an important component of agricultural biodiversity. The conservation and sustainable use of local aquatic ecosystems, ponds, rivers, coastal commons by artisanal fisherfolk and smallholder farmers is important to the survival of both humans and the environment. Since aquatic organisms, including fish, provide much of our food supply as well as underpinning the income of coastal peoples, it is critical that fisherfolk and smallholder farmers have genetic reserves and sustainable ecosystems to draw upon as aquaculture and marine fisheries management continue to evolve. = Ecosystem diversity = Rice terraces in Munduk. The mosaic of ecosystem components provides various ecosystem services Ecosystem diversity refers to the variety and variability of different components in a given geographical area (e.g. landscape, country). In the context of agrobiodiversity ecosystem diversity refers to the diversity within and between agroecosystems: e.g. pastures, ponds and rivers, planted fields, hedges, trees and so on. Landscape-level biodiversity has received less research attention than the other levels of biodiversity.  Contributions of agrobiodiversity to food and agriculture  = Introduction = Contributions from agrobiodiversity to food and agriculture are usually categorized by their contribution to ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are the services provided by well functioning ecosystems (agroecosystems and also wild ecosystems such as forests or grasslands) to human wellbeing. They are usually clustered into four broader categories: provisioning (direct provision of goods such as food and water), supporting (the services that are needed for agriculture to be healthy, such as soil), regulating (regulating natural processes needed in agriculture such as pollination, carbon capture or pest control), or cultural (recreational, aesthetic and spiritual benefits). = Provisioning = Camu camu is a neglected tree fruit species native to Brazil, with rich nutrient and antioxidant propertiesAgrobiodiversity's contribution to provisioning services is mainly for providing food and nutrition. Food biodiversity is \\"the diversity of plants, animals and other organisms used for food, covering the genetic resources within species, between species and provided by ecosystems.\\" Historically at least 6,000 plant species and numerous animal species have been used as human food. This number is considered to be decreasing now, resulting in concerns about long-term diet diversity. Food biodiversity also covers subspecies or varieties of crops, for example the many forms of the Brassica oleracea species (cauliflowers, different broccolis, cabbages, Brussel sprouts, etc.). Many species which have been overlooked by mainstream research ('orphan' or 'neglected and underutilized' species) are rich in micronutrients and other healthful components. Also among different varieties of a species, there can be a wide variety of nutrient composition; for example some sweet potato varieties contain negligible levels of beta-carotene, which others can contain up to 23,100 mcg per 100g of raw, peeled sweet potatoes. Other provisioning services from agrobiodiversity are the provision of wood, fibre, fuel, water and medicinal resources. Sustainable food security is linked to improving the conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the diversity of all genetic resources for food and agriculture, especially plant and animal genetic resources, in all types of production systems. = Supporting = Wild Onion Blossoms (Allium)Agrobiodiversity's contribution to supporting services is providing the biological or life support to production, emphasising conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the biological resources that support sustainable production systems. The main service is to maintain genetic diversity of crops and species, so that it is available to maintain adaptability to new and changing climate and weather conditions. Genetic diversity is the basis of crop and livestock improvement programmes, which breed new varieties of crops and livestock in response to consumer demand and farmers' needs. An important source of genetic diversity are crop wild relatives, wild plant species that are genetically related to cultivated crops. A second supporting service is to maintain the habitat of wild biodiversity, particularly associated biodiversity, for example pollinators and predators. Agrobiodiversity can support wild biodiversity through the use of field margins, riparian corridors, hedgerows and clumps of trees, which provide and connect habitats. A further supporting service is maintaining healthy soil biota. = Regulating = Agrobiodiversity makes several contributions to regulating services, which control the natural processes needed for a healthy agroecosystem. Pollination, pest control and carbon capture are examples.  Pollination  A larva of a ladybird, devouring aphids. Chimoio, Mozambique75% of the 115 major crop species grown globally rely on pollinators. Agrobiodiversity contributes to the health of pollinators by: (a) providing habitat for them to live and breed; (b) providing non- chemical biological options for pest control (see below) so that insecticide use can be reduced, and insect pollinators not damaged; (c) providing a symbiotic relationship of constant flower production, with crops flowering at different times, so that the pollinators have constant access to nectar- producing flowers.  Pest control  Agrobiodiversity contributes to pest control by: (a) providing a habitat for pests' natural enemies to live and breed in; (b) providing wide genetic diversity which means it is more likely that genes contain resistance to any given pathogen or pest, and also that the plant can evolve as pests and diseases evolve. Genetic diversity also means that some crops grow earlier or later, or in wetter or drier conditions, so the crop might avoid attacks from the pest or pathogen.  Carbon capture  Agrobiodiversity contributes to carbon capture if used as part of a package of agroecological practices, for example by providing cover crops which can be dug into the land as green manure; maintaining tree stands and hedgerows; and protecting the integrity of soils so that they continue to house local microbes. Farmers and breeders can use genetic diversity to breed varieties which are more tolerant to changing climate conditions, and which, combined with practices like conservation agriculture, can increase sequestration in soils and biomass, and reduce emissions by avoiding the degrading of farmlands. Using agroforestry, the inclusion of trees and shrubs as an integral part of a farming system, can also successfully sequester carbon. = Cultural = Celebrating Chhath puja with traditional fruit speciesAgrobiodiversity is central to cultural ecosystem services in the form of food biodiversity, which is central to local cuisines worldwide. Agrobiodiversity provides locally appreciated crops and species, and also unique varieties which have cultural significance. For example, ethnic traditional cultures influence the conservation of a wide diversity of rice varieties in China (e.g. red rice, sweet glutinous rices) developed by farmers over thousands of years and used in traditional cultures, rituals and customs. Another example are local food fairs, epitomized by the Slow Food movement, which celebrates local food varieties in order to add value to them, raise awareness about them and ultimately conserve and use them. In addition, some traditional cultures use agrobiodiversity in cultural rituals, e.g. many populations of fruit species (pomelo and mango) are maintained in rural communities specifically for use at the 'Chhath Puja' festival, celebrated in parts of India, Nepal and Mauritius. Home gardens are important as culturally constructed spaces where agrobiodiversity is conserved for a wide variety of social, aesthetic and cultural reasons. Genetic diversity is maintained by resource-poor farmers because of many non-monetary values, including culture and food.  Loss of agrobiodiversity  Agrobiodiversity is threatened by changing patterns of land use (urbanization, deforestation), agricultural modernization (monocultures and abandoning of traditional, biodiversity-based practices); Westernization of diets and their supply chains. It has been estimated that biodiversity as a whole is being lost at 100‚Äì1000 times the natural background rate. This extends also to agricultural biodiversity and loss of genetic diversity from farmers' fields and the wild. Agrobiodiversity loss leads to genetic erosion, the loss of genetic diversity, including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular combinations of genes (or gene complexes) such as those manifested in locally adapted landraces or breeds. Genetic vulnerability occurs when there is little genetic diversity within a population of plants. This lack of diversity makes the population as a whole particularly vulnerable to disease, pests, or other factors. The problem of genetic vulnerability often arises with modern crop varieties, which are uniform by design.Virchow, Detlef. Conservation of genetic resources: Costs and implications for a sustainable utilization of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture Springer, 1999. p22 An example of the consequences of genetic vulnerability occurred in 1970 when corn blight struck the US corn belt, destroying 15% of the harvest. A particular plant cell characteristic known as Texas male sterile cytoplasm conferred vulnerability to the blight - a subsequent study by the National Academy of Sciences found that 90% of American maize plants carried this trait.Kloppenburg, Jack Ralph Jr. \\"First the Seed: The political economy of plant biotechnology, 2nd edition\\" University of Wisconsin Press 2004. 163 Reduced agrobiodiversity influences, and is influenced by, changes in human diets. Since the mid-1900s, human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally. The differences between the foods eaten in different countries decreased by 68% between 1961 and 2009. The modern 'global standard' diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops, which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy (calories), protein, fat, and food weight that they provide to the world's human population, including wheat, rice, sugar, maize, soybean (by +284%), palm oil (by +173%), and sunflower (by +246%). Whereas nations used to consume greater proportions of locally or regionally important food biodiversity, wheat has become a staple in over 97% of countries, with the other global staples showing similar dominance worldwide. Other crops have declined sharply over the same period, including rye, yam, sweet potato (by -45%), cassava (by -38%), coconut, sorghum (by -52%) and millets (by -45%).  Conservation  Attempts to conserve or safeguard agrobiodiversity usually focus on species or genetic level of agrobiodiversity. Conservation of genetic diversity and species diversity can be carried out ex situ, which means removing the materials from their growing site and looking after them elsewhere, or in situ, which means that they are conserved in their natural or cultivated site. While these two approaches are sometimes pitted against each other as either/or, both have merits. Conservation practitioners recommend integrating both methods, according to the purpose of conservation, threats, uniqueness of diversity, etc. Dulloo chapter 5 = Ex situ conservation = ex situ conservation at a genebank at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia Ex situ conservation is defined as the ‚Äúconservation of components of biological diversity outside their natural habitats.‚Äù Ex situ conservation is the conservation of genetic resources (species, varieties, cultivars, sub-species, landraces etc.) for food and agriculture outside their natural habitat, in a managed environment including: botanical gardens, seedbanks, pollenbanks, field genebanks, cryobank or herbaria. Ex situ conservation is considered a relatively reliable way of maintaining genetic diversity, since it is usually preserved over the longer term and is less prone to change. The diversity of much of the world's major crops has been extensively collected and conserved in genebanks. Over 7 million samples are conserved in 1,750 genebanks worldwide. Collections are safety-duplicated as an insurance in case of damage to one genebank. In addition, most globally important collections of annual or seed-bearing crops have a backup in the Svalbard global seed vault. Ex situ conservation offers some advantages for seed-bearing crops: 1) Seed requires little space; 2) Ex situ conservation can be implemented anywhere; 3) There is easy access to what is conserved for distribution, further use, research and breeding; 4) Costs for maintaining genetic diversity that has no immediate production or market value are minimum. Weaknesses of ex situ conservation include: 1) it is costly to maintain seeds and germplasm healthily in perpetual storage, or in field collections; 2) Coverage of the diversity of neglected and underutilized crops or crop wild relatives is currently very limited. Genebanks have largely focused on the conservation of major staple crops, while non-staple crops represent only 2% of materials stored and crop wild relatives are also poorly represented; 3) There are species with ‚Äòrecalcitrant‚Äô seeds, which means they cannot be stored long term; 4) Specialized infrastructure and staff are needed. =In situ conservation = In situ conservation means \\"the conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats and the maintenance and recovery of viable populations of species in their natural surroundings and, in the case of domesticated or cultivated species, in the surroundings where they have developed their distinctive properties\\". In situ conservation comprises both conservation of trees and crop wild relatives in situ in the wild, and conservation of landraces and neglected and underutilized species on farm in farmers' fields. Conserving agrobiodiversity in situ has the benefit that species can continue to evolve in response to natural and human pressures. In the case of crops, a large amount of diversity is retained in developing countries by smallholder farmers, particularly for many crops in their centers of domestication and diversity. There, farmers continue to grow landraces and maintain traditional knowledge and seed management practices in a process known as de facto conservation. Home gardens too are repositories of high levels of species diversity, and traditional landraces contain wide genetic diversity. For forest trees, in situ conservation is considered the most appropriate method since most tree seeds cannot be conserved ex situ, and because there are 60,000 tree species, each with multiple populations, so too many to identify and collect. Having limited access to synthetic inputs, resource-poor farmers' fields are often organic by default. A meta-analysis of studies comparing biodiversity noted that, when compared to organic cropping systems, conventional systems had significantly lower species richness and abundance (30% greater richness and 50% greater abundance in organic systems, on average), though 16% of studies did find a greater level of species richness in conventional systems. In situ conservation is relatively low cost for high levels of biodiversity, particularly crop wild relatives, neglected and underutilized species, landraces, trees, fish and livestock. However, species and varieties conserved in situ can be vulnerable to climate changes, land use changes and market demand. = Ecosystem level conservation = Ecosystem level conservation looks at landscape level, with landscapes managed by the group of stakeholders working together to achieve biodiversity, production and livelihood goals. Land use mosaics combine # ‚Äònatural‚Äô areas # agricultural production areas # institutional mechanisms to coordinate initiatives to achieve production, conservation and livelihood objectives at landscape, farm and community scales, by exploiting synergies and managing trade-offs among them. There are limited initiatives that focus on conserving entire landscapes or agro-ecosystems. One is 'Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems' (GIAHS), which are conserved and maintained as unique systems of agriculture, in order to sustainably provide multiple goods and services, food and livelihood security for millions of small-scale farmers.

Since the very beginning of his career, he has been one of the favourites to lead the new generation of Cantopop. He has been described as a breath of fresh air in the HK music scene. Over the last ten years, Chan has emerged as the leading male singer of his generation, fulfilling his role as an innovator and a leader in the HK music scene, winning prestigious awards one after another. Chan has also been successful in his work in the Mandopop scene. He has won numerous awards in both mainland China and Taiwan, most notably Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards. His album Admit It was nominated for Golden Melody Awards' Best Male Singer; although it was ultimately won by Gary Chaw. Next year, he was again nominated for Golden Melody Awards' Best Male Singer, for his work in Mandarin album \\"Don't Want To Let Go\\", although the award went to Jay Chou. However, Chan won Album of The Year for \\"Don't Want To Let Go\\". Chan has been named by Chinese critics as the next God of Songs (Ê≠åÁ•û) after Jacky Cheung. However, Eason has more than once clarified that he wishes to build his own name instead, and not just be the successor of Jacky Cheung. Chan and Cheung have sung a duet together, titled Â§©‰∏ãÂ§™Âπ≥, on the album Perfect Match by Albert Leung and Ronald Ng (‰ºçÊ®ÇÂüé), released in April 2006.

Japanese Musician Ikuro Fujiwara praised Chan for his charisma on stage and expressed hope to collaborate with Chan in the future. Chan planned to promote his musical works in Japan in 2010. In 2011, Chan released a new album titled \\"Stranger Under My Skin\\" on 22 February.

His first series of concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum, a total of four Eason's 99Big Live concerts and came four years after his debut in 1995. Even today, that amount of time is considered short for a singer to gain the general approval and public support needed to perform at such a prestigious venue. Two years later in 2001, Chan held a series of nine The Easy Ride concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum under the wing of his second record company, Music Plus. In 2003, he again held a series of seven The Third Encounter concerts with the support of Music Plus. In the spring of 2006, after a year of rest and another change of record company, Chan held his fourth theme concerts, a total of nine Get a Life concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum. A year later, Chan broke his own record while holding his fifth series of concerts named Eason's Moving on Stage. During October and November 2007, he completed a total of 16 hugely successful Chan's Moving on Stage1 concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum. As of January 2008, Chan has held 45 concerts at Hong Kong Coliseum. Chan began his Moving on Stage World Tour in February 2008. He traveled to Taiwan, Canada, Australia, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Malaysia, Macau, Singapore, Kunming, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Hangzhou, Guiyang, Beijing, and Foshan. Chan's Moving on Stage World Tour ended with Eason Chan's Moving on Stage 26 at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 16 August 2009. Months after his Moving On Stage Concerts came to finish, Chan began another tour in mainland China, called \\"Ninety Minutes of Bliss\\". Instead of playing at grand venues, Chan played at smaller venues in order to get closer to his fans. He completed two concerts in Nanjing and three more in Shanghai before and during Christmas 2009. Two more concerts were held in Beijing on 29 and 30 May in 2010. In between his tours, Chan held his sixth record-breaking Theme Concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum for a total of 18 concerts, scheduled from 20 March to 6 April 2010. This new series is called Duo Eason Chan 2010 Concert („ÄäDUOÈô≥Â•ïËøÖ2010ÊºîÂî±ÊúÉ„Äã).

At Chan's concert in Beijing on 29 September 2011 at the Beijing Workers' Stadium, Faye Wong made a special guest appearance, surprising many as Wong had not previously accepted any invitations to appear as a special guest at another singer's concert; this was the first time that she did so.

They begin at Mica Peak near Spokane and extend approximately 320 km north (200 miles) from the border to Kinbasket Lake, at the now-inundated location of the onetime fur company post Boat Encampment. The range is bounded on its west, northeast and at its northern extremity by the Columbia River, or the reservoir lakes now filling most of that river's course. From the Columbia's confluence with the Beaver River, they are bounded on their east by the Purcell Trench, which contains the Beaver River, Duncan River, Duncan Lake, Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay River. The Selkirks are distinct from, and geologically older than, the Rocky Mountains. The neighboring Monashee and Purcell Mountains, and sometimes including the Cariboo Mountains to the northwest, are also part of the larger grouping of mountains known as the Columbia Mountains. A scenic highway loop, the International Selkirk Loop, encircles the southern portions of the mountain range. The Selkirks were named after Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk. History USGS surveyors on Scotchman Peak in 1900 In 1857 gold was discovered in the Selkirks. Coal, copper, marble, mercury, silver, and zinc were also found in the mountains. During the development of Western Canada, the Selkirks presented a formidable barrier to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, until A.B. Rogers discovered the mountain pass that bears his name in 1881-1882\\\\. As a result of the railway's construction via that route, Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks (Canada) in the heart of the Selkirks were among the first national parks created in Canada, along with Yoho and Banff National Parks in the Rockies. Until the completion of the Trans-Canada Highway via the Rogers Pass, automotive traffic between most of British Columbia and the rest of Canada necessarily was forced to follow the path of the Columbia River via its Big Bend, around the north end of the Selkirks. Fauna This area, some of it protected in Washington's Salmo-Priest Wilderness, is also home to mule deer and white-tailed deer, elk, black bears, cougars, bobcats, red fox, bald eagles, golden eagles, osprey, great blue heron, porcupine, badgers, coyote, martens, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, gray wolves and moose. Formerly rarely seen, grizzly bears are also known to roam through this region now in abundance. =South Selkirk mountain caribou= The southern end of the Selkirk Mountains was the home of the last naturally occurring caribou herd in the contiguous United States, the South Selkirk mountain caribou. The herd was cross boundary, spending some time in extreme northern Idaho, eastern Washington, and British Columbia, Canada. The South Selkirk mountain caribou is a woodland mountain caribou, an ecotype of the boreal woodland caribou, one of the most critically endangered mammals. In 2009 the herd of 50 animals was declining, by April 2018, only three remained, and in January 2019, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) announced in its scientific journal, Science, that British Columbia's provincial biologists captured the female caribou in Canada and moved her to a captive rearing pen near Revelstoke in the hopes of \\"preserving highly endangered herds\\". According to the AAAS, it is believed that this female caribou is the \\"last member of the last herd to regularly cross into the lower 48 states from Canada\\".

He stayed at UCLA two years, starting every game as a freshman in 2000, and being named second-team All-Pac-10 as a sophomore. =Professional= Akwari left college after his sophomore year to pursue opportunities in Europe, but when nothing came of them, he signed a Project-40 contract with MLS late in the 2002 season. Akwari was put into a lottery, which the MetroStars won; Akwari appeared in seven games and was traded during the offseason to the Columbus Crew. Akwari saw little playing time in 2003, appearing in 11 games but starting only five for the Crew, while spending a lot of time on loan to A-League's Cincinnati Riverhawks. In his third year in the league, Akwari began to show much more of the promise that he had as a youth national teamer - he took possession of the starting right back position midseason, and remained there for the rest of the year, ending the season with 16 starts as the Crew won the MLS Supporters' Shield. After the 2004 season, Akwari was selected tenth overall by Real Salt Lake in the Expansion Draft, reuniting him with old coach John Ellinger. Akwari played 41 games over the 2005 and 2006 seasons. Akwari signed for USL Second Division side Charlotte Eagles in April 2007, and scored on his debut against Crystal Palace Baltimore on April 20, 2007. He then signed for Charleston Battery in 2008, spending two seasons with the club including a run to the final of the 2008 US Open Cup. Akwari signed on 26 January 2010 for the Canadian club Vancouver Whitecaps a one-year contract.'Caps add centre back Nelson Akwari He scored his first professional goal for Vancouver on April 29, 2010 in a game against the Portland Timbers. On October 19, 2010, the Vancouver Whitecaps released Akwari. Akwari joined the expansion Los Angeles Blues in the USL Pro league for the 2011 season. Akwari retired following the 2011 season and settled in Charleston, where he works as an engineer for Boeing and is a frequent commentator on Battery game broadcasts. =International= Akwari has represented the United States at the U-17, U-20 and U-23 levels, playing at the 2001 U-20 World Youth Championship in Argentina, and the 1999 U-17 World Youth Championship in New Zealand.

The story concentrates on Julien, a man with schizophrenia, played by Scottish actor Ewen Bremner, and his dysfunctional family. The film also stars Chlo√´ Sevigny as Julien's sister, Pearl, and Werner Herzog as his father. Julien Donkey-Boy is the sixth film to be made under the self-imposed rules of the Dogme 95 manifesto, and the first non-European film to be made under the Dogme 95 \\"vow of chastity\\". Plot Julien, a young man with untreated schizophrenia, meets a young boy playing with several turtles in a New York City park. Fascinated by the animals, Julien asks if he can have one. When he is denied, he strangles the boy to death, then buries his body in the mud before praying for mercy from God. At home, Julien resides with his dysfunctional family, consisting of his domineering and emotionless German father; his childlike pregnant sister Pearl (whose child may be Julien's); his younger brother, Chris, an aspiring wrestler who spends his days exercising and practicing wrestling moves; and their paternal grandmother, who is largely disconnected from the rest of the family. The family's father spends the majority of his time recounting national historical narratives, drinking, and inflicting psychological and physical abuse on Chris. During one of Chris's exercise sessions, his father forces him outside in the cold and hoses him down with water. He also pines for his deceased wife, going so far as begging Chris to wear his mother's wedding dress and dance with him. Meanwhile, Julien works as a teacher's aide at a school for the blind. Julien spends most of his spare time going to confession, muttering to himself on the streets, and imagining conversations with Adolf Hitler. Julien is also riddled with grief over his mother's death, and Pearl sometimes soothes him by pretending to be their mother on the telephone. Pearl spends most of her days searching for baby clothes for her soon-to-be-born child, and making lists of her favorite baby names. Searching for other hobbies, she decides to take up learning to play the harp. Chris compulsively exercises practices wrestling moves on trash cans, and sometimes incites match with Julien. Their father recounts historical stories, lambasts Julien and Pearl for \\"artsy-fartsy\\" poetry and being \\"a dilettante and a slut\\" respectively, and pines for his dead wife. Julien and Pearl accompany their father to a sermon at a local Baptist church, which has a profound impact on Julien. Some time later, Pearl and Julien spend a day together going ice skating at an indoor skating rink. Julien tries to sell some homemade skates to a Hasidic boy and Pearl takes to the ice despite being heavily pregnant. She trips, landing on her abdomen and causing a miscarriage. At the hospital, Julien convinces a nurse to let him hold the baby, saying it is his. She allows it, but while alone with the baby, Julien escapes home on a bus. Julien goes to his room, hides under the blankets, cradles the baby and mutters prayers. Cast Production Julien Donkey- Boy was the first American film made in accordance with the Danish filmmaking manifesto Dogme 95. It was shot in New York on MiniDV tape, the film was transferred to 16mm film before being blown up to 35mm film for the master print. Korine used this method to give the film a low-definition, grainy aesthetic. The film utilizes several cinematographic styles, including stop- motion photography, parallel cuts, and still photographs in order to tell its story. =Dogme 95= Korine broke a few of the Dogme 95 rules in making the film. For example, Dogme 95 stipulates that all props must be found at the location of filming. Julien's dead baby is a prop found in the maternity unit of the hospital where the scene was shot; it was used by the nurses there to practice pre-natal CPR. Also, all the camerawork is supposed to be handheld, but this film uses hidden cameras, technically not handheld. There is also non-diegetic music (Oval's \\"Mediaton\\" from Systemisch in the ice-skating scene, same group's \\"Shop In Store\\" from 94 Diskont), although it sounds like it alternates between diegetic and non-diegetic use. And finally, the director must not be credited; Korine is credited (however, the film only gives his name ‚Äî it does not say \\"directed by Harmony Korine\\", just \\"Harmony Korine\\"). Despite these transgressions, the original Dogme 95 committee endorsed Julien Donkey-Boy. In an interview on the Epidemic DVD, Lars Von Trier, Dogme 95 co- creator, lauded Korine's ability to interpret the rules creatively. Release The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 1999. It received a limited release in Los Angeles at a single cinema on October 15, 1999; the film showed for a month's time at the Los Angeles theater, and grossed a total of $80,226 by that November. It was given a wide theatrical release in European countries the following year, particularly in France and the Netherlands. =Critical reception= Critical reaction was negative and the film currently holds a 28% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews. Retrieved February 26, 2014 Based on 23 reviews, Julien Donkey-Boy has a 52/100 rating on Metacritic, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Retrieved February 26, 2014 Empire Magazine said that \\"Despite some creditable performances, Korine's bizarre, shambling direction renders the result less ground-breakingly experimental than rectum-numbingly dull.\\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \\"A self-indulgent mess.\\" Despite a sense of negative reaction to the film, it was praised by some critics. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, saying the film attained a \\"depth of compassion and understanding ... [it] acquires a spiritual dimension that allows it ultimately to become an act of redemption\\". Additional praise for the film came from Chicago Sun Times film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film 3/4 stars, saying that \\"[The film] adds up to something, unlike a lot of movies where individual shots are sensational, but they add up to nothing\\"; Ebert did, however, note that the film had a very limited audience: \\"The odds are good that most people will dislike this film and be offended by it. For others, it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn. You know who you are\\".

Walker, Rosomans Street, London Stoke Gifford is a village, and parish in South Gloucestershire, England, in the northern suburbs of Bristol. It had around 11,000 residents at the 2001 census, increasing to 15,494 at the 2011 census. It is home to Bristol Parkway station and Stoke Gifford depot, on the London- South Wales railway line, and the Bristol offices of Aviva which took over Friends Life in 2015, Hewlett Packard and the University of the West of England. The parish includes neighbouring Little Stoke, Harry Stoke and Stoke Park. The parish borders Filton, to the south-west, Patchway to the north west, Bradley Stoke to the north and Winterbourne and Hambrook to the east. To the south Stoke Gifford is served by the Bristol Ring Road, south of this a large green area known as the 'Green Lung' stretches to the inner city area of St Werburghs. Descent of the manor =Giffard= Following the Norman Invasion of 1066, William the Conqueror gave the manor of Stoke Gifford to Osbern Giffard, one of his knights. Giffard himself was a native of Longueville-le-Giffard, Normandy, now known as Longueville-sur-Scie, from which the 'Gifford' suffix derives. The 'Stoke' part of the name may come from the Stoke Brook, or may also be a reference to the Saxon word 'Stoche' meaning 'property of or dependent farmstead'. Bradley Stoke and Stoke Lodge, both 20th-century estates, were also given the name. Extensive histories of Stoke Gifford can be found online. =Berkeley= ermine between ten crosses pattee argent. These arms may be seen in The Gaunts Chapel, Bristol and are the arms of the Barons Berkeley with the difference of a chevron ermine in place of a chevron argent The manor remained in the Giffard family until 1337, when it was granted to Maurice de Berkeley (died 1347), 2nd son of Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (1271‚Äì1326). Thus was founded the long and distinguished cadet branch of \\"Berkeley of Stoke Gifford\\". In 1553 a new late- Tudor manor house was built by Sir Richard Berkeley (died 1604), 7th in descent from Maurice de Berkeley (died 1347). It became known as Stoke Park, and was rebuilt in 1750 by Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt (died 1770), from a neo-classical design by Thomas Wright. Governance The area falls in the Stoke Gifford electoral ward. This ward starts in the east at Winterbourne. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 15,494. Local amenities The Church of England parish church of St Michael's is a Grade II* listed building. The church runs a pre-school nursery in the old vicarage, and a small coffee shop in the Old School Rooms across The Green from the church, which backs onto Parkway railway station. Also in the local area are two parks, each with children's play equipment; a pair of tennis courts and a pub, the Beaufort Arms. There is a row of shops on Ratcliffe Drive including a Tesco Express, dentist and medical centre and few more shops on one of the roads off North Road. There are several large supermarkets within walking distance and most of the local children walk or cycle to nearby St Michael's C of E Primary School & Abbeywood Community School. Stoke Gifford Parish Council provoked national interest and condemnation in April 2016 when they resolved to charge parkrun runners a fee to use a park, resulting in the closure of the event in June 2016. Stoke Gifford Cricket Club in 2018 won the Bristol & District 30 over cricket league. Expansion in the 20th century Like much of the nearby area, Stoke Gifford undertook rapid expansion in the 20th century, prior to the 1980s Stoke Gifford was just a small village, straggling along the main street, North Road. The Old School Rooms hosts the Explorer Scouts, Scouts, Cub Scouts, Beaver Scouts and Brownies. St.Michael's School was listed in the December 2008 report as 'St Michael's is a good school...the care, guidance and support for pupils is outstanding' In 2008, a new pre-school and Nursery opened adjacent to Bristol Parkway due to the population increases of the surrounding areas.

However, for several decades weak emperors had been unable to enforce the \\"Ecclesiastical Reservation\\" against Protestant encroachments.  Background  This lack of decisive or effective authority along with the Protestant view of the legal interpretation as well as the value of the land and the characteristic dislike for all things Catholic led several princes to secularize the Catholic church lands under the treaty established and customary practice of cuius regio, eius religio. This usually occurred when a Catholic head of the church converted to Protestantism. The Peace of Augsburg, signed in 1555, had confirmed the result of the Diet of Speyer (1526) which had, by agreeing to disagree, ended with this principle as a prime result. With that principle confirmed by the Treaty at Augsburg, the violence of that earlier day between the Lutherans and the Catholics in Germany ended‚Äîat least for the generation, until renewed tensions brought about the Thirty Years' War. Behind all this were the inheritance practices in Europe as a whole and in particular the German states within the Holy Roman Empire. Land and control over it was a source of both power and wealth, and the noble families sought to control as much land within the extended family as was possible, for example by appointing younger sons prince-bishops or prince-abbots.  The Edict  The \\"Edict of Restitution\\" was an attempt to ensure that the \\"Ecclesiastical Reservation\\" of the Augsburg treaty was retroactively enforced. It had a tremendously polarizing effect causing the approximately 1,800 states of the Holy Roman Empire to shatter into disparate blocks of opposed interests. If fully effected, it would have affected the already secularized archbishoprics of Bremen and Magdeburg, 12 bishoprics and over 100 religious houses around the German states. The Edict resulted in a great transfer of power and property away from the Protestants to the Catholics, and in effect broadened a divisive religious struggle into that plus a dynastic struggle for power, as seen from the viewpoint of many smaller German princes, who might otherwise have stayed neutral. Other states were greatly affected when the mercenary armies marched through neutral states or ravaged them in the course of their foraging expeditions. Thousands of Protestants fled to Protestant controlled states, generally broadening the war, and central Germany was ravaged repeatedly, by some estimates losing between 25% and 50% of its pre-war population because the competing armies continually took the food‚Äîthe majority of civilian deaths being caused by the twin side-effects of famine, and deaths from endemic diseases under populations weakened by famine. The greatest impact was in northeast Germany. It was here that Ferdinand's power was at its weakest. Ferdinand appointed Imperial administrators to take over the secularized states and cities, re- establishing Imperial authority in an area that had been free of Imperial rule for nearly 100 years. Ferdinand's actions were not well received by the princes. It was a move that alarmed the French and led to the French intervention in the war. The German princes could do nothing. They had seen the Coalition destroyed. Wallenstein had a massive army of 134,000 troops in the field to enforce Imperial authority. Wallenstein disliked the Edict as it trespassed into the region he considered his own but he played his part for the emperor to the full. He stated that \\"he would teach the Electors manners. They must be dependent on the emperor, not the emperor on them.\\" The response of the princes was to rally behind Maximillian of Bavaria to pressure Ferdinand into dismissing Wallenstein. Their chance came in 1630 when Ferdinand called a meeting of the Electors in Regensburg because he wanted his son, Ferdinand III, elected King of the Romans. According to the law, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was selected by a vote from the Electorate of German princes. Therefore, Ferdinand needed their cooperation to approve his son as successor. Ferdinand also hoped to persuade the Electors to approve greater Imperial involvement in the European wars. John George I of Saxony and George William of Brandenburg (both Protestant) stayed away to protest the Edict of Restitution. Those Electors present realized that they had little to gain from additional involvement in the wars. However, Maximillian still asked Ferdinand for the dismissal of Wallenstein. To win over the Electors, Ferdinand sacked Wallenstein in August 1630 though Wallenstein argued that he was allowed to resign to save face. The dismissal of the most powerful military figure in Europe was a major victory for the Electors and Regensburg must be seen as a defeat for Ferdinand. All of this was overshadowed in July 1630‚ÄîGustavus Adolphus landed in Pomerania with 4,000 men in response to the persecution of the Protestants. Without Wallenstein, Ferdinand had to turn to Maximillian and Tilly to stop the new threat. In 1635 the Edict of Restitution was effectively revoked, with the terms of the Peace of Prague. Twenty two theologians led by Cardinal Dietrichstein : the majority Dominicans and capuchins led by Don Diego Quiroga voted in favour of repeal. A minority of Jesuits led by Fr Lamormaini voted against. \\"It would not be displeasing to God\\" for the Edict to be decided in the best interest of peace (ie it was left to temporal powers to decide).Wallenstein his life narrated by Golo Mann  References  Category:1629 in law Category:1629 in religion Category:1629 in Germany Category:1629 in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Christianity and law in the 17th century Restitution ","title":"Edict of Restitution"},{"id":"1166571","text":"Jeonji of Baekje (died 420) (r. 405‚Äì420) was the eighteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. As the eldest son, he was confirmed as successor to King Asin, in 394. His queen was Lady Palsu of the Hae clan. Jeonji spent much of his youth in the Wa kingdom of Yamato Japan as hostage, going there in 397. Upon his father‚Äôs death, he returned home to find that his uncle Seollye had murdered Hunhae, Asin's other brother, and usurped the throne. Hae Chung, an inhabitant of Hanseong, warned him not to enter the capital. Shortly thereafter, Seollye was killed and Jeonji made king. Presumably out of gratitude for this, Jeonji made several members of the Hae clan ministers, as well as marrying Lady Palso of the Hae clan. This put an end to the royal family‚Äôs close ties to the Jin clan. The traditional dates of Jeonji's rule are based on the Samguk Sagi. On the basis of more contemporaneous Chinese records, Best (1979) has suggested that the years 405-414 are more plausible. According to the Samguk Sagi, in 406 Baekje sent a tribute mission to the Chinese court of Eastern Jin. It is the first mention of such a mission in more than twenty years, and may indicate that the country had become more secure against Goguryeo. It would have been typical to send such an embassy to inform the Chinese court that a new king had taken power. However, this visit is not confirmed by Chinese sources.

Both suburbs are distinctly geographically separate from the rest of Tauranga by the Tauranga Harbour; two road bridges (SH2 and SH29) and a windy rural road (Welcome Bay Road) are the only feasible access ways to the rest of the city. Mauao (The Mount) is a large lava dome which rises above the town. According to Maori legend, this hill was a pononga [slave] to a mountain called Otanewainuku. The conical headland which gives the town its name is in height, and dominates the mostly flat surrounding countryside. It was formerly a MƒÅori pƒÅ, and the remains of trenches can be seen in the ridges, as well as ancient shell middens. Today, it is open to the public year-round, and is a popular place to either walk around, or climb up. From the summit, a good stretch of coastline can be seen in either direction, as well as the Kaimai Range to the west. Politics Over the years Mount Maunganui had suffered a number of attacks on its sovereignty by Tauranga but had fought fully and effectively to remain independent until the 1989 local government reforms. During 1974 Bob Owens was Mayor of both Mount Maunganui and Tauranga, a unique situation in the annals of local government in New Zealand. Mr Owens made no secret of the fact that he favoured the joining of the two municipalities. The election of 1974 was fought on this issue and Owens was defeated in the polls with a landslide victory to Mr L. Kelvin O'Hara, the youngest person elected to the position of Mayor in New Zealand, who challenged him on the issue, and other environmental issues with the catch cry \\"why share a mayor?\\" It remains controversial in Mount Maunganui whether the transition from an independently administered unit of local government to a minor part of the Tauranga City Council over 20 years ago was beneficial. Some Mount Maunganui residents are still of the opinion Tauranga and Mount Maunganui are separate towns, even though they officially amalgamated in 1989. Simon Bridges, the local Member of Parliament for the area, described it in Parliament in 2012 \\"I have to say that there still is, though‚Äîand I have found this when first standing for Parliament‚Äîa sense of the \\"Mounties\\" and of those who are city-side, and that is still present to some extent\\" History Mount Maunganui was initially known colloquially as 'Maunganui' until 1907, when the name was rejected during the application process to name the area when the first subdivision of land was carried out; it was dismissed as being too similar to other towns' names. One of the early settlers, J. C. Adams, then suggested three alternative names, which were Te Maire, Tamure (the MƒÅori name for Snapper), and Rakataura, with the latter name selected by the Survey Department. The official name Rakataura never came into common use as Maunganui had long been the unofficial name of the town. The name Mount Maunganui was a rebranding by early developers, changing it from Rakataura. The current name is an example of a tautological place name, maunga being a MƒÅori term for mountain (nui means \\"big\\"). Mount Maunganui fought fiercely and successfully during the 1950s to retain independence from Tauranga, then failed with the completion of the harbour bridge in 1988. The former Mount Maunganui Borough Council set records in New Zealand as having never had a deficit in its history, something which Tauranga City Council has never achieved. Critics say the town was built by leveraging the commercial and industrial ratepayers, but Mount Maunganui was a forerunner in some areas and applied the user pays philosophy before it was common in New Zealand. The original early 1900s house of early settler J. C. Adams, the first home ever built at Mount Maunganui, still stands at 4 Adams Avenue. The circa 1906 house is registered with Heritage New Zealand as a Category II historic building. The local Whareroa Marae and Rauru ki Tahi meeting house is a meeting place for the NgƒÅi Te Rangi hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Kuku and NgƒÅi Tukairangi.

Mount Maunganui is regarded by many to be a coastal resort town, although Port of Tauranga, a major facility, is also partly located on the western (harbour) side. It is also well known for the quality of its surfing conditions, though parts of the beach are notoriously dangerous. The harbour bridge was opened in 1988,Harbour Bridge Heritage linking Mount Maunganui with Tauranga. The construction of a duplication bridge was completed in December 2009, forming a vital link in Tauranga and Mount Maunganui's growing motorway system. A large container terminal and overseas wharf is located at Mount Maunganui. A branch railway from the East Coast Main Trunk railway runs between the Te Maunga and northern parts of the suburb. Mount Maunganui also features the popular Bayfair Shopping Centre. The centre is one of the largest in the North Island outside Auckland and Wellington. Mount Maunganui is a popular New Years destination, with over 20,000 people frequenting the suburb over the New Years period. Many festivities take place on and around the main beach in the north of the suburb. As part of the Port of Tauranga is located in Mount Maunganui, there are many cruise ship visits annually to the suburb.  Sport  ASB Baypark Stadium The suburb is home to the cricket ground Bay Oval, which held the 2018 ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup final on 3 February 2018. Every year Mount Maunganui hosts the Northern Regional Surf Championships (NRC's), and other events such as the NZ Under 14 Ocean Athlete Championships, the Pro Volleyball Tour and The Port of Tauranga Half Ironman triathlon.  Artificial reef  New Zealand's first artificial reef was installed at the Mount.MountReef.co.nz Construction of the reef was hampered by lack of funds and ironically, too many waves. Initially the public was told the reef would cost about $500k, but costs escalated to $800k,. Media reported that local surfers are disappointed with the waves produced by the reef. The reef has also been blamed for creating rips and has now been removed.

Early years John \\"Jack\\" Purvis was born in Kokomo, Indiana on December 11, 1906 to Sanford B. Purvis, a real estate agent and his wife Nettie (Jackson) Purvis.Lost Chords: White Musicians and Their Contribution to Jazz, 1915 to 1945, Richard M. Sudhalter, Oxford University Press, 1999, page 471 Jack's behavior became uncontrollable after his mother's death in 1912, and, as a result of many acts of petty larceny, he was sent to a reform school. While there, he discovered that he had an uncanny musical ability, and soon became proficient enough to play both the trombone and trumpet professionally. This also enabled him to leave the reformatory and continue his high school education, while he was playing paying gigs on the side. One of the earliest jobs he had as a musician was with a band led by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Not long afterward, he worked with the dance band of Hal Denman. After high school he worked in his home state for a time then went to Lexington, Kentucky where he played with the Original Kentucky Night Hawks. Around this time he learned to fly planes. In 1926 he was with Bud Rice and toured New England. He then worked the remainder of 1926 and the beginning of 1927 with Whitey Kaufman's Original Pennsylvanians. Purvis married in Pittsburgh, in 1927, and soon became a father. His daughter, Betty Lou, was, for a time, a disc jockey in Pittsburgh in the late 1940s, and a correspondent for Down Beat magazine. This was Purvis' only verified marriage, and rumors persist that he committed bigamy on several occasions. For a short time he played trumpet with Arnold Johnson's orchestra, and by July 1928 he traveled to France with George Carhart's band. It is reported that he had an early brush with the law when he cheated a tourist out of his travelers checks and was forced to leave the band and flee France. Ship's passenger list information reports \\"Jacques F. Purvis\\" returning to New York, from Le Havre, France, on November 19. 1928. In 1929 he joined Hal Kemp's band. From 1929 to 1930 Purvis recorded with Kemp, Smith Ballew, Ted Wallace (a pseudonym for agent Ed Kirkeby), Rube Bloom, the California Ramblers, and Roy Wilson's Georgia Crackers. On December 17, 1929 Purvis led his own recording groups using Hal Kemp's rhythm section to produce Copyin' Louis, and Mental Strain at Dawn.The Classic Jazz, Backbeat Books, Scott Yanow, 2001 The 1930s In 1930, Purvis led a couple of racially mixed recording sessions including the likes of J.C. Higginbotham, and Adrian Rollini. One of these sessions was organized by Adrian Rollini and OKeh A & R man, Bob Stephens. After leaving Hal Kemp in 1930, allegedly because legal issues precluded his going with the band to Florida, Purvis found work with the California Ramblers. He also worked with the Dorsey Brothers and played fourth trumpet with Fletcher Henderson, although only in a rehearsal capacity. Purvis' mental stability was always in question, and he attempted suicide on several occasions. Although he was a brilliant musician, capable of either a hot jazz solo or a difficult passage through the hardest of arrangements, he could not be counted on to arrive anywhere on time. This lack of accountability plagued him throughout his life, and can be traced to his earliest years. In many instances, once Jack Purvis showed up to play an extended engagement, not so coincidentally, there was a spike in petty thefts and burglaries for the vicinity of that gig. From 1931 to 1932 he played with a few radio orchestras and worked with Fred Waring. In 1933 he toured the South with Charlie Barnet. He even talked his way into a job with the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra playing The Carnival of Venice. During this time he also worked in Texas as a pilot perhaps smuggling illegal goods out of Mexico. He moved to California and was successful with radio broadcasting work. In Los Angeles, Purvis worked for the George Stoll Orchestra as a writer and even worked for Warner Bros. Studios arranging. He composed Legends of Haiti for a one hundred and ten piece orchestra. Afterwards he found work in San Francisco as a chef. At the end of 1935 he joined Frank Froeba's Swing Band in New York. These 1935 recordings with Froeba were the end of Purvis' recording career. He played a couple of weeks with Joe Haymes' orchestra and then disappeared for a couple of years. There was a confirmed sighting of him working in a diner in the midwest around this time. It is also speculated that he worked as a ship's cook on a freighter at the time. He was arrested in Texas in June 1937, while working as a cook, for his involvement in a robbery in El Paso, Texas. He was tried and convicted and sentenced to jail time in Huntsville Prison. While in prison he directed the Rhythmic Swingsters, the prison band and also played piano with them. The band regularly broadcast on radio station WBAP in 1938.Black Beauty, White Heat:A Pictural History of Classic Jazz, Frank Driggs & Harris Lewine, Da Capo Press, New York, 1995, page 103 Later life In August 1940, Purvis was conditionally pardoned from prison, but he quickly broke his parole and was sent back to prison for six more years. Some sources claim he did this deliberately because he missed the prison band. On September 30, 1946 Purvis was released from prison one last time. He had a wild reputation and is said to have set hotel rooms on fire. He seldom stuck with one band for very long and was known to hit the streets as a busker. From this time onward he worked at non-musical careers which included working as a chef, an aviator in Florida, a carpenter, a radio repairman in San Francisco. At sometime in his checkered life he was also a mercenary in South America. According to researcher Paul Larsen, Purvis gassed himself to death in San Francisco on March 30, 1962. Yet Purvis' death certificate indicates the cause of death to be \\"fatty degeneration of the liver\\" rather than death by gas poisoning. Stories persist that a man who looked like (and introduced himself as) Jack Purvis showed up at a band date by cornetist Jim Goodwin and the two men had a long talk about his life on two occasions in 1968.Lost Chords: White Musicians and Their Contribution to Jazz, 1915 to 1945, Richard M.

Rejection and migration Surface piercings can be difficult to heal. They are the most likely to reject as they only break through small amounts of skin. This leaves less skin to keep the piercing secure. The body sees the body jewelry as a foreign objects and can \\"reject\\" it. It will push it to the surface of the skin causing it to \\"grow out\\".About: Tattoo/Body piercing Proper placement and jewelry selection by an experienced body piercer can help alleviate this problem. A healed surface piercing can last from a few months to a life time. The body resists foreign objects inside itself, and that includes piercings. Rejection occurs when it is \\"easier\\" for the body to push the piercing out like a splinter than it is to heal a fistula (skin tunnel) around it. You can spot rejection happening when there is abnormal redness around the piercing and then after a while, you can start to see the jewelry through the skin. Additionally as a recipient of a piercing you can recognize rejection or infection as a general warmth, irritation or an itchy sensation. As soon as you notice or think you notice rejection happening go to a professional body piercer or general practitioner immediately. Rejection can be dangerous and could be indicative of serious infection. Rejection is common among piercings including surface piercings, navel piercings, and eyebrow piercings among others. Choosing an experienced piercer is also a good way to help reduce rejection. Never be afraid to ask the piercer questions on what to expect as they would know the chances of rejection for the specific piercing they will be performing and may suggest a different approach to this procedure such as different jewelry or changing the location slightlyhttps://www.freshtrends.com/pages/surface-piercings. Migration is when the piercings start to move away from the original area where they were put through the skin. This is a very slow process and can be to detect. Some symptoms to look for are sensitivity or soreness around the piercing, the skin over the pricing getting noticeably thinner, they pierced hole looking larger or the piercing looking looser in general.https://www.byrdie.com/body-piercing-rejection-and-migration-3187308 Proper placement and jewelry selection by an experienced body piercer can help reduce the chances of both of these situations to occur. A healed surface piercing can last from a few months to a lifetime if treated properly.  Cleaning  To help decrease the chance of rejection, cleaning a surface piercing regularly is a good idea. Always start by washing your hand before cleaning your piecing. The best way to clean it is to use a saline solution or non-iodized sea salt solution, not agitating the piercing. The piercing should be cleaned a few times a day for the first few weeks. Avoid rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide as they will slow the healing process by drying and killing the new healthy cells. Staying away from ointments such as bacitracin is also ideal, this limit the oxygen transport in the covered tissues https://uhs.berkeley.edu/health-topics/body-piercings.

The college closed after spring commencement in 2018; the University of Massachusetts Amherst acquired the campus and renamed it the Mount Ida Campus of UMass Amherst. History The Mount Ida School for Girls, once a high school, became a finishing school and was founded in 1899 by George Franklin Jewett, and was named after the hill on which it was located in Newton Corner, Massachusetts. After encountering severe financial difficulties, it was forced to close during the Great Depression, but was purchased by William Fitts Carlson in 1939 and relocated to its present location in the Oak Hill section of Newton. The first junior college level courses were offered at Mount Ida in the mid-1900s, and the school was officially re-branded as a junior college in 1961. It was subsequently granted the ability to award associate degrees with the first being awarded in 1967. The school was later renamed as Mount Ida Junior College, and became a co- educational institution in 1976 which was a logical step since so many Vietnam veterans were attending college in the 1970s thanks to the G.I. Bill. Several Boston-based institutions also merged with Mount Ida on the Newton campus: Chamberlayne Junior College (1988), New England Institute of Funeral Service Education (1989), and Coyne Electrical and Technical School. The Senior College division awarding bachelor's degrees began in stages. In 1982, Massachusetts allowed Mount Ida to grant three bachelor's degrees as Mount Ida filed to drop the \\"Junior\\" part of the college name. The Senior Degree program was fully accredited in 1984, with an emphasis on career and professional education. In 2012, Barry Brown was appointed president of the college. =Closure= In February 2018, the college explored merging with Lasell College, another liberal arts institution located in Newton. The reasons given for the proposed merger were to help keep tuition cost as low as possible and maintaining academic quality. Two weeks later, UMass Amherst announced plans to acquire the Newton campus. Classes ended after the commencement in the spring of 2018 and students of the small school were offered automatic admission to UMass Dartmouth (though that university does not have all of the same academic programs). Newbury College (which itself closed in 2019) announced that it would grant full transfer credit to Mount Ida students and would help them finish their degrees. Keene State College and Worcester State University also invited students to their campuses and committed to review applications for immediate acceptance and full credit transfer. In response to the campus closure, an immediate meeting was called by Mount Ida faculty. During the meeting, students and parents voiced their frustration with President Brown and the Board of Trustees. Some questioned the pay of administrators such as President Brown, who made over $445,000 in 2015 even as the school was struggling financially.http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2016/042/104/2016-042104736-0e2fd936-9.pdf Campus Located in Newton, Massachusetts, Mount Ida College was located on a 72-acre campus that once belonged to William Sumner Appleton (1840‚Äì1903), father of William Sumner Appleton Jr. The estate was transferred to Robert Gould Shaw II after Appleton's death. Shaw commissioned Boston architect James Lovell Little Junior to build a carriage house and horse stable in 1910; this building was subsequently refurbished and was known as Holbrook Hall. The building known as Shaw Hall, which became the nucleus for the Mount Ida campus, was also commissioned by Shaw and designed by Little in 1912. The building known as Hallden Academic Support Center was also constructed in 1912, presumably by Little. The Shaw fortune collapsed during the Great Depression, and Dr. Carlson purchased the vacant and decaying Shaw Estate and reopened Mount Ida Junior College in 1939. In 1956, a two-story dormitory designed by architect Albert C. Rugo was added to Shaw Hall. Rugo designed several other buildings that were added to the complex in the 1950s and 1960s. Academics Mount Ida College consisted of four schools: * The School of Applied Sciences * The School of Design * The School of Business * The School of Social Sciences and Humanities The Gallery at Mount Ida College held exhibitions of regional, national, and international fine artists and designers. The Gallery had featured works in photography, painting, sculpture, video, and a variety of other art forms. The Gallery opened in 1999, allowing artists and designers to have a showcase for traditional and alternative media works as an innovative part of the Mount Ida College Learning Community. Athletics Mount Ida's athletes competed as the Mustangs in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference in NCAA Division III varsity sports, as well as IHSA equestrian competition. Three teams captured North Atlantic Conference (NAC) championships: the 1999, 2000 men's soccer team, the 2002 women's volleyball team, and the 2007 men's lacrosse team. The Mount Ida Mustangs football team competed from 1999 to 2017, compiling an all-time record of compiled an all-time record of 76‚Äì119 in 19 seasons and sharing the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference (ECFC) championship in 2012.

The NDP formed government after this election, and Uruski served as a government backbencher for the next four years. Uruski defeated Guttormson again in the 1973 provincial election, despite the fact that the Progressive Conservative Party declined to run a candidate for fear of vote-splitting with the Liberals. On August 29, 1973, he was named a Minister without Portfolio, responsible for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation and the Motor Vehicle Branch. On March 31, 1976 he was also given responsibility for the Civil Service Act. On September 22, 1976, he was promoted to Minister of Municipal Affairs, still retaining responsibility for the CSA. The NDP were defeated in the general election of 1977, and Uruski was re-elected by a reduced margin. There were some suggestions that he would run to succeed Schreyer as party leader in 1979, although these ultimately came to nothing. Howard Pawley led the NDP to a majority government in the 1981 election, and Uruski was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Interlake. He returned to cabinet on November 30, 1981, as Minister of Agriculture. Until August 20, 1982, he also held responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act. Uruski attempted to develop his party's support base in rural Manitoba while serving as Agriculture Minister, though he had little success to this end. He did, however, attain some success in opening Manitoba hog production to the American marketplace. On September 21, 1987, Uruski was again made Minister of Municipal Affairs with responsibility for the MPIC. Early in 1988, the NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature when backbencher MLA Jim Walding voted with the opposition in an evenly divided house. Uruski was one of only twelve New Democrats re-elected in the election which followed, and formally stepped down from cabinet with the resignation of his government on May 9, 1988. He did not seek re-election in 1990. Uruski was known as a promoter of aboriginal issues during his time in government (his riding has a large aboriginal population). In 1995, he was among the first to investigate alleged connections between the supposedly autonomous Independent Native Voice party and the Progressive Conservatives, after reports circulated that Interlake INV candidate Darryl Sutherland was running at the behest of local Tory interests with the intent of splitting the NDP vote. These allegations would become public three years later, and a public inquiry would rule that Sutherland had, in fact, been persuaded to run by local Tory organizers. In 1999, Uruski served as the NDP campaign manager in Interlake, working for party candidate Tom Nevakshonoff. Uruski later became part of the Manitoba Rural Adaptation Council Inc.. He also returned to farming, and served on the board of the Manitoba Turkey Producers organization. In 2003, he represented the Poultry Welfare Coalition in a presentation to the Senate of Canada. He has criticized the tactics of the Monsanto Company in expanding their corporate base in the Canadian prairies. From 2006 to 2009, Uruski served as chairman of the Manitoba Cattle Enhancement Council.

The Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two active cavalry regiments of the Danish Army, and was formed in 2001 through the amalgamation of the original Guard Hussars regiment, Zealand Life Regiment and Danish Life Regiment. History = Origins of the regiment= A Guard Hussar soldier interacts with the local population in Helmand, Afghanistan. Although the Guard Hussars themselves date from 10 February 1762, the Danish Army takes the date of the founding of a regiment from its oldest part, in this case the Zealand Life Regiment, which was founded in 1614. This makes the Guard Hussars one of the oldest regiment of hussars in the world still operational, it is also the only hussars in mounted parade uniform to still wear the slung and braided pelisse which was formerly characteristic of this class of cavalry. In addition to its operational role, the Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two regiments in the Danish Army (along with the Den Kongelige Livgarde) to be classed as 'Guards'; in this case, the Mounted Squadron perform the same role as the Household Cavalry do in the British Army. From 1961 to 1972 the regiment was responsible for two armoured battalions, one recon battalion. From 1972‚Äì2000 the regiment was responsible for one armoured, one mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and one infantry battalions. From 2000‚Äì2004 the regiment was responsible for two armoured, two mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and two infantry battalions. From 1992‚Äì2004 the regiment also had to form two light Reconnaissance Squadrons assigned to the 1st Zealand Brigade and Danish International Brigade. = 2001 amalgamation= As part of the Defence Agreement 2000‚Äì04, it was decided to merge the Guard Hussar Regiment with the Zealand Life Regiment and the Danish Life Regiment. With this amalgamation of the three infantry regiments, the name and history of the new regiment had to be decided. This led to what the media called \\"the Colonels' War\\" (), with the three colonels fighting for their regiment‚Äôs name and history to survive. The Chief of Defence, Christian Hvidt, ordered the old insignia removed, which was not customary. The new armoured horse head was nicknamed the \\"biker patch\\". Furthermore, it was decided that a colour be used alongside the standard. =Modern times= Following the amalgamation, the Guard Hussar Regiment has participated in a number of international missions, resulting in the loss of 16 soldiers. Structure Today the Gardehusarregiment is classed as a cavalry regiment, it is in fact a mixed armoured and infantry unit, with three battalions: * 25px 1st Battalion ‚Äì Armoured Infantry (part of 1st Brigade) ** 25px Staff Company ** 25px 1st Armoured Infantry Company (1/I/GHR) ** 25px 2nd Mechanised Infantry Company (2/I/GHR) * 25px 3rd Battalion ‚Äì Reconnaissance (part of 2nd Brigade) motto:Nec temere nec timide (Neither random nor timidly) ** 25px Staff Platoon (Inactive) ** 25px 1st Light Reconnaissance Squadron (1 LOPKESK) ** 25px 2nd Light Reconnaissance Squadron (2 LOPKESK) ** 25px 3rd Light Reconnaissance Squadron (inactive until 2023) ** 25px Marine Squadron (4th Basic Training Squadron) * 25px 5th Battalion ‚Äì Basic Training (part of 2nd Brigade) motto:Terror in Hostes ‚Äì Vor fjender til frygt ** 25px 1st Basic Training Company motto:Fremad p√• ny ‚Äì hurtig og adr√¶t (Forward again - fast and agile) ** 25px 2nd Basic Training Company (Livkompagniet) motto:Fremad p√• ny ‚Äì lige p√• og h√•rdt (Forward again - head on) ** 25px4th Mechanised Infantry Company (4/V/GHR) * 25px Mounted Squadron ‚Äì Public duties/ceremonial ;Disbanded Units * 25px II/GHR Armoured Battalion (1955‚àí1976), Infantry Battalion (1977-2000), Armoured Infantry Battalion (2001-2018) * 25px IV/GHR Infantry Battalion (1983‚àí1996), Armoured Infantry Battalion (1997-2013). * 25px VI/GHR Infantry Battalion (2000-2004). * 25px VII/GHR Infantry Battalion (2000-2004).

Since a corporate restructuring in 1971, the railroad has been under CN's subsidiary holding company, the Grand Trunk Corporation. Grand Trunk Western's routes are part of CN's Michigan Division.Canadian National CN-News Its primary mainline between Chicago and Port Huron, Michigan serves as a connection between railroad interchanges in Chicago and rail lines in eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States. The railroad's extensive trackage in Detroit and across southern Michigan has made it an essential link for the automotive industry as a hauler of parts and automobiles from manufacturing plants.

GTR's objective was to have a mainline from shipping ports in Portland, Maine, to rail connections in Chicago through the southern part of the Province of Canada that would serve Toronto and Montreal.Mika, Nick and Helma. Railways of Canada, A Pictoral History. 1972. McGraw Hill Ryerson Ltd. In 1859 the Grand Trunk completed its route to Sarnia, Canada West, and began a ferry service across the St. Clair River to Port Huron. GTR would lease the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction Railroad to reach Detroit and from there would then run over the Michigan Central Railroad's line from Detroit into Chicago. It was on the line from Port Huron to Detroit that a 12-year-old Thomas Edison held his first job as a newsboy and candy butcher onboard passenger trains. Grand Trunk established its own route to Chicago across Michigan when the New York Central Railroad's William Henry Vanderbilt took over control of the Michigan Central in 1878. GTR sought to put together a route by acquiring three railroads it had already been sending some of its Chicago bound trains on since 1877. The Chicago and Lake Huron Railroad, the Chicago and Northeastern Railroad (C&NE;) and the Peninsular Railway of Michigan and Indiana together formed a direct route from Port Huron through Flint and Lansing, Michigan to Valparaiso, Indiana where it connected into Chicago on the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago Railroad. However, Vanderbilt owned the Chicago and Northeastern section of the route from Flint to Lansing and would charge Grand Trunk higher rates to move its freight over the line. Vanderbilt would soon sell the C&NE; to Grand Trunk when GTR bought the other two lines in 1879 and proposed building its own route between Flint and Lansing just north of Vanderbilt's line. Grand Trunk completed its own route into Chicago from Valparaiso in 1880 and incorporated the entire line from Port Huron to Chicago as the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway.Hofsomer, Don. Grand Trunk Corporation, The Canadian National Railways in the United States 1971‚Äì1992. 1995. Michigan State University Press. =More routes= Over the next two decades through either leases or purchases Grand Trunk would acquire several other branch lines in Michigan. It would take control of the Michigan Air-Line Railway through a lease in 1881. The line connected with the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction at Richmond, Michigan and ran to Jackson, Michigan through Romeo and Pontiac. When Grand Trunk purchased the Great Western Railway in 1882 it also acquired the Detroit Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH&M;) which Great Western had owned since 1877. The DGH&M; gave Grand trunk a route from Detroit through Pontiac, Durand and Grand Rapids to Grand Haven, Michigan where it would begin its Lake Michigan railcar ferry operations in 1902. The DGH&M; would connect with the Chicago and Grand Trunk at Durand and with the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction in Detroit. Durand would become a major junction point for Grand Trunk when it continued to increase its mileage. It acquired the 96 mile Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway from Ashley, Michigan to Muskegon, Michigan in 1888. GTR would obtain trackage rights to reach the line at Ashley from Owosso, Michigan with the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway, the predecessor of the Ann Arbor Railroad. Grand Trunk acquired a route into Saginaw, Michigan in 1890 with the lease of the Cincinnati, Saginaw & Mackinaw Railroad from Durand to Bay City, Michigan. The line was the last to be held as a leased property until January 1943 when it was fully merged into Grand Trunk Western. =Western Division= By 1900 Grand Trunk would unite the operations of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway and all of its lines in Michigan, Illinois and Indiana under a subsidiary company called the Grand Trunk Western Railway Company. The name derived from the fact that GTR's rail lines west of the St. Clair and Detroit rivers were referred to as its Western Division. The lines had also operated under the name Grand Trunk Railway System. Pontiac also continued to become another important junction point when the Pontiac Oxford and Northern Railroad was acquired in 1909. It ran north from Pontiac to Caseville in Michigan's thumb region. By 1910 GTW would have a network of trackage connecting all of lower Michigan's major manufacturing cities when it acquired a lease on a short branch of the Chicago, Kalamazoo and Saginaw Railroad giving it access to Kalamazoo, Michigan. A few years before in 1902 GTW had gained access into Ohio with its shared ownership of the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad. The line was a small carrier that had a multi- track mainline bridging Detroit and Toledo, Ohio and was purchased equally by GTW and the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad, a predecessor of the Nickel Plate Road. GTW eventually took complete control of the line when it bought Nickel Plate's half interest from its successor Norfolk and Western Railway in 1981.Moody's Transportation Manual, 1992, p. 233, 237 =Terminal railroads= Grand Trunk Western also owned or co-owned terminal switching railroad companies in some of the cities it operated in. Beginning in 1905 it co-owned equal shares of the Detroit Terminal Railroad with New York Central (NYC). By the 1970s Detroit Terminal was suffering financial losses and GTW negotiated to sell its share to NYC's successors Penn Central and Conrail until it dropped its ownership in 1981. In Grand Rapids, Michigan it acquired the Grand Rapids Terminal Railroad in 1906. In Bay City, Michigan it owned the Bay City Terminal Railway and in Kalamazoo it took over the nearly three mile long Chicago and Kalamazoo Terminal Railroad by 1910. Prior to moving its ferry operations to Muskegon GTW also acquired the railway belt-line Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company in 1924. The company would exist as a GTW subsidiary until 1955.Labelle Models Muskegon Railway and Navigation For its entry into Chicago GTW, along with the Erie, Wabash, Chicago and Eastern Illinois and Monon railroads, was a co-owner of the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad (C&WI;) beginning in 1883. It performed passenger and express car switching duties at Chicago's Dearborn Station. GTW was also part of a group that created and shared ownership in the Belt Railway Company of Chicago that connects every rail line in the Chicago area. =Canadian National= By 1919 GTW's parent Grand Trunk Railway of Canada was suffering financial problems related to its ownership of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The Canadian Government nationalized Grand Trunk and other financially troubled Canadian rail companies by 1923 and amalgamated them into the new government owned entity, the Canadian National Railway. GTW would become a subsidiary of the new entity and was reincorporated as the Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company on November 1, 1928 when nearly all of its lines were formerly merged under the company. =River tunnel= GTW's predecessor Grand Trunk Railway also sought to expedite its rail service between Port Huron and Sarnia by constructing the world's first international submarine rail tunnel under the St. Clair River. The St. Clair Tunnel, completed in 1891, approximately long and hand dug, allowed Grand Trunk to discontinue its ferry service across the river. The tunnel was the last link in GTR's complete mainline from Chicago through southern Canada. In 1992 Canadian National began construction of a new larger tunnel next to the original tunnel to accommodate double stacked intermodal containers and tri-level auto carriers used in freight train service. The new tunnel was completed in 1994 and dedicated on May 5, 1995. GTW also gained trackage rights in 1975 to use Penn Central's Detroit River Tunnel between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. Penn Central's successor Conrail sold the tunnel to CN and Canadian Pacific Railway in 1985. Eventually CN sold its share of the Detroit tunnel in 2000 after the new St. Clair tunnel was completed. The railroad's first major line abandonment came in 1951 when it abandoned about half of the former Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway line from Muskegon to Greenville, Michigan. That same year Grand Trunk Western bought its headquarters building at 131 West Lafayette Avenue in downtown Detroit. At the end of 1970 GTW operated of track on of road and that year it reported 2,732 million net revenue ton-miles of freight and 49 million passenger-miles. Grand Trunk Corporation After several years of Canadian National subsidizing the financial losses of Grand Trunk Western, a new holding company would be established by CN in 1971 to manage GTW. The Grand Trunk Corporation was created to shift full control of GTW operations to Detroit and begin a strategy to make the railroad profitable. CN's other American properties, the Central Vermont Railway and the Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway (DW&P;) would also be placed under the new corporation initially for tax purposes. GP38AC locomotive 5801 built by EMD in 1971 with the red, white and blue schemealt= With the new corporation came a new autonomy for GTW from its parent CN. Grand Trunk Western had always shared equipment, color schemes and corporate logos with Canadian National. It shared CN's herald styles with its own name on the previous \\"tilted herald\\" and \\"Maple Leaf\\" logos. In 1960 when CN launched its new image GTW had its own initials incorporated into the \\"wet noodle\\" logo and followed with CN's black red/orange and gray locomotive color scheme. However, to show its new autonomy from CN in 1971 GTW began receiving its new locomotives in its famous bright blue, red/orange and white scheme. Most of GTW's freight cars also received the blue and white color scheme. With new management the railroad implemented a new strategy to market shippers and improve its performance. In 1975 the railroad adopted its company slogan: The Good Track Road. This slogan promoted GTW's track maintenance efforts, at a time when many Eastern and Midwest railroads suffered from deferred maintenance. The company also encouraged better safety practices which earned it the E.H. Harriman Award for safety five times in the 1980s. =Detroit, Toledo and Ironton merger= Part of the railroad's new strategy in the 1970s and 1980s was to seek new routes to expand and compete in the long haul railroad market. After Conrail took over the railroad operations of Penn Central in 1976 the Penn Central Corporation sought to divest itself of its subsidiary the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad (DT&I;). After petitioning the Interstate Commerce Commission GTW won approval over a joint bid from Norfolk and Western and Chessie System to acquire the DT&I; in June 1980. The acquisition increased GTW's trackage around Detroit's industries including Ford Motor Company's large River Rouge Complex, DT&I;'s classification hump yard in Flat Rock, Michigan and routes south into Ohio with access to rail interchanges in Cincinnati, Ohio. As part of the ICC's approval GTW was obligated to divest its half or buy Norfolk and Western's share in the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line. It purchased N&W;'s share in April 1981 for $1.9 million and completely merged the line into GTW later that same year. =Milwaukee Road= Grand Trunk Western sought to further expand its trackage by seeking to purchase one of the bankrupt Midwest railroads, the Milwaukee Road or the Rock Island, of the 1970s. After inspecting the Rock Island's property and finding its trackage in need of costly repairs, GTW turned its attention in 1981 to acquiring the Milwaukee Road. GTW saw the acquisition of the Milwaukee Road (shorn of its Pacific Coast Extension and many of its midwestern branchlines) as an opportunity to expand its route further south and west to rail interchanges in Kansas City, Missouri, and Louisville, Kentucky. It would also afford GTW the opportunity to connect directly with its corporate cousin the DW&P; at Duluth, Minnesota. Instead of initially placing a bid for the Milwaukee Road and seeking immediate ICC approval GTW embarked on a strategy to improve the line's revenue and track maintenance. GTW and Milwaukee Road would enter into a voluntary coordination agreement where GTW would direct more of its shipments over the Milwaukee Road's route. It would also launch a marketing effort promoting the merger. However, as the Milwaukee Road became more successful two other potential bidders, the Soo Line Railroad and the Chicago and North Western Railway, petitioned the ICC to purchase the railroad. Despite GTW's efforts the ICC rejected its bid and, after a further bidding war between the Soo and the C&NW;, approved of the Soo Line's acquisition of the Milwaukee Road and the two roads were merged in January 1986. =Improving efficiency and downsizing= During the 1970s and 1980s Grand Trunk Western would continue to improve its efficiency and embark on efforts to improve its operating ratio. It had consolidated some of its operations including dispatching in Pontiac, locomotive maintenance in Battle Creek and railcar maintenance in Port Huron. Its intercity passenger train operations would be handed over to Amtrak in 1971. Responsibility for GTW's commuter rail operation in Detroit was turned over in 1974 to the regional transportation authority SEMTA. GTW moved into the intermodal freight business by creating intermodal transfer yards in Chicago in 1975 and suburban Detroit, in 1978. The railroad's president at the time, John H. Burdakin, was also a proponent of the Automatic Car Identification (ACI) system. It was a means to identify the location of shipments and equipment with bar code labels on the sides of freight cars and locomotives. The labels were read by automatic scanners at various rail yards. When Conrail was formed in 1976 GTW sought to acquire some of its routes in Michigan. It gained 151 miles (243 km) of trackage between Saginaw and Bay City as well as near Muskegon and Midland, Michigan. Several of GTW's cuts in its expenditures came from reductions in its workforce through changes it negotiated in union work rules. In 1978 it discontinued its Lake Michigan railcar ferry operations after consecutive years of financial losses over $1 million. By 1987 the company sold its headquarters building on Lafayette Avenue in Detroit and moved to the new office park complex Brewery Park. The complex was developed on the site of the former Stroh's Brewery near downtown Detroit. Locomotive performance was also enhanced with a rebuilding program of its EMD GP9s. By the 1990s several miles of routes and facilities were abandoned or sold to regional rail companies. GTW would eliminate all of the former Pontiac Oxford and Northern line north of General Motors' Lake Orion manufacturing plant by 1985. In 1987 the former Cincinnati, Saginaw, and Mackinaw and the former Detroit, Grand Haven, and Milwaukee routes north of Durand were sold to the Central Michigan Railway. Elsdon Yard, GTW's primary terminal and rail yard in Chicago had been downsized and closed by 1990. It had also sold almost the entire route of the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton in 1997 to the shortline rail operator Railtex. By 1998 it had abandoned the entire former Michigan Air Line route except for a portion in Oakland County, Michigan, it sold to Coe Rail. With the end of SEMTA commuter rail service to Downtown Detroit in 1983 GTW abandoned and sold its trackage from the Milwaukee Junction area to downtown Detroit. That line was the former route to Brush Street Station and its railcar ferry dock on the Detroit River. It is known as the Dequindre Cut which has been transformed into an urban greenway rail trail. By the year 2000 engine terminals and maintenance facilities had also been eliminated or downsized in Chicago, Detroit, Durand, Pontiac, Port Huron and Battle Creek. =CN North America= GP38-2 4900 at Battle Creek, Michigan in the CN color scheme with GTW reporting marksalt= In December 1991, Canadian National announced a corporate image and restructuring program to consolidate all of its U.S. railroads under the CN North America brand. Grand Trunk Western along with other CN owned subsidiaries would see their images replaced with the CN logo and name. All GTW corporate identification and that of its new corporate cousins the Illinois Central Railroad (acquired by CN in 1999) and Wisconsin Central Ltd. (acquired by CN in 2001) are referred to with CN's name and corporate image. However, while each railroad's locomotives would eventually receive CN's logo and black, red-orange and white paint scheme they would still retain their respective reporting marks. Despite the corporate re-branding GTW's blue color scheme and its logo would persist on rolling stock and locomotives for several years while they are slowly either repainted or retired. CN also reintegrated managerial and some operational control of GTW as it would gradually shift out of Detroit and into CN headquarters in Montreal. GTW would continue to maintain some office and dispatching functions from offices in suburban Troy, Michigan. All the routes that make up GTW are part of CN's Midwest Division in its Michigan Zone. Grand Trunk Corporation, now formally headquartered at CN in Montreal, is the holding company for almost all of CN's U.S. properties which include Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Wisconsin Central, Duluth, Winnipeg & Pacific and Great Lakes Transportation which includes the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad and the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway. The Association of American Railroads has considered the Grand Trunk Corporation as a single non- operating Class I Railroad since 2002. Grand Trunk Western still exists as a corporate entity but can now be considered a company on paper. CN refers to GTW's routes and operations in its corporate communications as the former Grand Trunk Western territory. Locomotives =Steam= Grand Trunk Western was one of the last U.S. railroads to employ steam locomotives. It ran the last scheduled steam passenger train in the United States on March 27, 1960 on its train #21 from Detroit's Brush Street Station north to Durand Union Station. The run drew thousands of rail enthusiasts. With 3,600 passengers holding tickets train #21 had to be run in two sections (as two separate trains) to accommodate the excess of passengers. GTW U-3-b class 4-8-4 Northern-type locomotive 6319 led the first section of train #21 with 15 passenger cars and GTW 4-8-4 Northern 6322 pulled the second section with 22 passenger cars. Steam was used on some freight trains until 1961. Wells, Charles Chauncey. Ride of a Lifetime, When Grand Trunk Western honored a cab- ride request for a 12-year-old. Classic Trains Magazine, Kalambach Publishing, Spring 2010 A 1909 photograph of a Grand Trunk Western locomotive and crew at the alt= GTW's predecessor lines primarily used 4-4-0 American-type locomotives before the turn of the 20th century. Throughout its history GTW has shared the same type and class designations of its locomotives with parents Grand Trunk Railway and Canadian National. Its locomotive road numbers would also be integrated into CN's roster sequence. By the first half of the 20th century the railroad's largest steam power would be its Northern type 4-8-4 locomotives, called Confederations by CN. The locomotives built by the American Locomotive Company in the 1930s and 1940s had driving wheels with 60,000 pounds of tractive effort and would be used in mainline freight and passenger service. Six GTW U-4-b class 4-8-4s built by Lima Locomotive Works would have streamlined shrouding and driving wheels to be used only in passenger service. Other steam locomotives in GTW's fleet at the time included the Mikado type 2-8-2s built by Baldwin Locomotive Works and Alco primarily used in mainline freight service. 4-6-2 Pacific type and 4-8-2 Mountain type locomotives also built by Baldwin and Alco in the 1920s and 4-6-0 Ten-Wheelers built around 1900 began in mainline service but later were eventually both found mostly on branch lines and mixed train service. GTW also had a variety of other models of steam engines including several 0-8-0 and 0-6-0 switching locomotives used to move rolling stock around rail yards. Surviving steam locomotives Some of GTW's steam engines survive today as static park displays or in operation. Three are park displays in Michigan, they include Baldwin built Pacific 4-6-2s at Durand and Jackson and an 0-6-0 at Sidney Montcalm Community College Heritage Village. Steamtown National Historic Site has GTW #6039, a U-1-c class 4-8-2 Mountain type. The Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois has #6323, a U-3-b class 4-8-4, and #8380, a P-5-g class 0-8-0, as part of its collection. Locomotive #4070, an S-3-a 2-8-2 Light Mikado appeared in the 1984 film The Natural and is now stored in Cleveland, Ohio. As of 2012, the only operating former GTW 4-8-4 locomotive is the U-3-b class #6325 on the Ohio Central System. =Diesel= Kalamazoo near Battle Creek is one of the GP9s the railroad rebuilt and designated a GP9Ralt= The first diesel locomotive to operate in regular service in Michigan arrived in 1938. It was Grand Trunk Western 7800, an EMC SC switching locomotive to work in Detroit. Previously in 1925, GTW acquired from EMC an early motorized gas- electric railcar known as a Doodlebug. The cars were self-propelled units resembling a passenger car with a baggage compartment and a coach section for passengers that GTW used on its Detroit to Port Huron and Richmond to Jackson routes until 1953. GTW also had another gas-electric locomotive referred to as a box-cab built by Brill in 1926. Originally built for the Long Island Rail Road, GTW purchased it in 1934 and numbered it 7730. It was relegated to loading and unloading freight cars from GTW ferries in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The unit was eventually converted to diesel power in 1939 and served in Milwaukee until 1960. GTW continued to dieselize its locomotive fleet in the 1940s and 1950s primarily with models from EMD which was owned by one of GTW's largest freight customers, General Motors. The exceptions were approximately 40 Alco S-2 and S-4 switching locomotives. Other diesel locomotives from EMD included several NW2s, SW900s and SW1200s purchased for switching duties in rail yards and on branch lines. Grand Trunk Western's first mainline road diesel locomotives were almost two dozen EMD F3As acquired in 1948. They would be followed in the 1950s by EMD GP9s and GP18s for freight and passenger service. The GP9s would be rebuilt by GTW's Battle Creek locomotive shops into GP9Rs with improved internal components and modern low-nose cabs. A Tracker was created on Facebook to locate the remaining GTW Units in GT Colors. Second-generation diesel locomotives GTW 5812, an EMD GP38-2, in Waukesha, Wisconsin on May 16, 2020. The next new motive power to be acquired would be the EMD SD40 in 1969. These would be GTW's first six-axle locomotives and most would last on GTW for at least four decades. GTW's most dominant diesel locomotive in its fleet would be the 2,000 horsepower EMD GP38. The first GP38s were delivered in 1971 and were also the first locomotives to wear GTW's blue, red/orange and white scheme. It proved to be a versatile locomotive for GTW used in switching and mainline service. The GP38AC was the first version to be purchased by GTW which had an alternating current alternator instead of the typical direct current generator. That followed with the acquisition of several GP38-2s into the 1980s. GTW would also purchase its new locomotives without dynamic brakes since the company did not have any significant grades on its routes. GTW also inherited several locomotives including its first 3,000 horsepower GP40-2s from its acquisition of Detroit Toledo and Ironton. It would also roster its first EMD GP7s when it obtained full ownership of the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line in 1981. GTW management found it cost effective to lease or purchase second-hand diesel locomotives. It purchased several former Rock Island GP38-2s after that railroad closed in 1980. Union Pacific sold GTW several surplus former Missouri Pacific SD40-2s after it had acquired that railroad. It was also common for GTW and CN to share steam and diesel locomotives when either of them was in need of extra motive power. GTW also sent diesel locomotives for use to its fellow GTC subsidiary railways Central Vermont and Duluth Winnipeg and Pacific. many GTW GP38s still wear their original blue, red/orange and white paint scheme and have been found operating throughout CN's other US subsidiaries. However, since 1991 CN has gradually retired, sold or applied its own paint scheme to GTW locomotives. Facilities The first locomotive in Grand Trunk Western's Battle Creek locomotive shops. c. 1908 Over its history Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine terminals located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, Flat Rock, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In each of the cities GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1910 the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek and rail car repair and maintenance was handled by GTW's Port Huron car shops. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction pointes. There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee Junction area in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad's rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail in 1976. On Chicago's south side GTW's Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into the city in the 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junctions Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975 GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as Railport. The facility is in Chicago's Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976 when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called GT MoTerm. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton's former hump classification yard in Flat Rock, which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT&I; still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several interlocking and crossing gate towers were also maintained by GTW through its history. Passenger trains Grand Trunk Western's primary passenger trains were Maple Leaf, the International Limited, the Inter-City Limited and The LaSalle, which provided service between Chicago's Dearborn Station and Toronto Union Station. In 1967, GTW introduced The Mohawk as a fast through train between Chicago and Brush Street Station in Detroit. Passenger operations were handed over to Amtrak (National Railroad Passenger Corporation) in 1971. Amtrak's Chicago to Port Huron trains, known as its Blue Water Service, operates over GTW's route between Battle Creek and Port Huron. The railroad also operated suburban commuter trains between downtown Detroit and Pontiac, Michigan from August 1931 until January 1974 when the now defunct Southeast Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) took over operating the commuter trains. Amtrak's Detroit‚ÄìChicago trains now originate or terminate over this former commuter line making stops in the northern Detroit suburbs of Pontiac, Troy and Royal Oak, Michigan. Part of GTW's former route in Detroit to Brush Street Station and its railcar ferry dock known as the Dequindre Cut has been transformed into an urban greenway rail trail. Car ferries =Lake Michigan= The carferry steamship Grand Rapids at Muskegon, Michigan in 1980 Grand Trunk Western was one of three Michigan railroads, along with the Ann Arbor Railroad and Pere Marquette Railway, that operated separate railcar ferry service across Lake Michigan between Michigan and Wisconsin. Loading rail cars onto ships that had rails mounted to their decks, and ferrying the cars east and west across Lake Michigan, allowed railroads to bypass the congested rail interchanges in Chicago and move time-sensitive freight more quickly. GTW's ferry service was originally operated by the former Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH&M;), which Grand Trunk Railway acquired in 1882. DGH&M; initially had agreements with ferry companies operating on Lake Michigan to transfer its passengers and freight onto ships bound for Milwaukee from Grand Haven, Michigan.Great Lakes Car Ferries‚ÄìGrand Trunk, Suite101.com, September 18, 2010 GTW's rail car ferry service began in 1902 with an operating agreement with the steamship company, Crosby Transportation Company. The railway constructed ferry slip docks at Grand Haven and Milwaukee and had two steamships built, the SS Grand Haven and , capable of carrying 26 freight railcars. In 1905 Grand Trunk assumed Crosby's interest and incorporated the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company to operate the ships. In Milwaukee GTW interchanged rail cars with the Milwaukee Road, Chicago and North Western and the Soo Line. The ownership of the ferry company was shared with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) from 1927 until 1954 and sailed as the Grand Trunk-Pennsylvania Route. The SS Milwaukee sank loaded with rail cars in a storm after departing Milwaukee in October 1929 with everyone aboard lost. Three new ships, the Grand Rapids, Madison, and the City of Milwaukee constructed between 1926 and 1931, replaced the Grand Haven and Milwaukee. The ships required a crew of 34 and with strengthened ice-breaking hauls operated year-round. On PRR's request, GTW moved its Michigan docks to Muskegon, Michigan in 1937 where its subsidiary the Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company initially operated ferry loading and switching operations. GTW had also changed its route into Muskegon with trackage rights over PRR's line from Grand Rapids. By 1968 GTW was shipping over of freight a year across Lake Michigan. However, the ferry service began running deficits of over $1 million annually in the 1970s and in 1975 GTW petitioned the ICC to end the service. Permission was eventually granted and the last ferry sailed on October 31, 1978. =River ferries= St. Clair River The first river ferry service began in 1860 when the Grand Trunk Railway's tracks reached Sarnia, Ontario, and it had to transfer its passengers and freight across the St. Clair River to Port Huron and on to the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction Railroad to Detroit or its Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway route to Chicago. GTR started its St. Clair River ferry service with a type of swing ferry-barge. The barge was anchored by of chain. When the barge was loaded, it was released into the current to dock on the opposite side of the river. When this proved unreliable Grand Trunk replaced it with the wood- burning steamer International II in 1872.Great Lakes Car Ferries ‚Äì The River Ferries, Suite101.com, June 18, 2010 It soon was joined in service by the steamer Huron. The ferries continued until 1891 when Grand Trunk completed its rail tunnel connecting Sarnia and Port Huron under the river. However, GTW and CN reinstated the ferry service 80 years later in 1971 with its Rail-Barge service to accommodate the larger freight railcars that were higher than the 1891 tunnel's height clearance. The St. Clair river barges discontinued service again in 1995 after the new larger St Clair Tunnel was completed. Detroit River Grand Trunk's river ferry service on the Detroit River connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario was also inherited from its 1882 purchase of the Great Western Railway. Great Western's ferry service began after its rails reached Windsor in 1853. Because Great Western's track gauge of was different from the standard American gauge of it had to transfer its cargo off railcars and onto the ships. By the 1860s Great Western made its railway dual gauge by adding a third rail to it tracks to accommodate rail cars of both gauges. Its first side-wheel steam ferry, the Great Western, arrived in 1866, and when first launched it was the largest steel vessel on the Great Lakes. The Wabash Railroad contracted with Grand Trunk in 1897 to use its ferry service to connect Wabash's own route from Detroit through Southwest Ontario to Buffalo, New York. Wabash started its own service after 1910 when it acquired Michigan Central's ferries when that railroad opened the Detroit River Tunnel. Eventually GTW's parent CN took over sole responsibility for ferry operations on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers. The Detroit River ferry operation ceased running in 1975 when GTW was granted trackage rights to use Penn Central's Detroit River Tunnel to connect with CN in Windsor. The start of construction of the Renaissance Center in Detroit in 1973 necessitated the removal of GTW's Detroit ferry slip docks. During the more than 130 years of rail car ferry operations on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers all the major railroads, including Michigan Central, Pere Marquette, Wabash and Canadian Pacific, had ferry operations on the Detroit River. The GTW/CN rail car ferry service was the last to operate in the Great Lakes when it ended operations on the St Clair River in 1995.

Smouldering at the bottom are hardwood wood chips. The sacking at the back is used to cover the racks while they are smoked. The Arbroath smokie is a type of smoked haddock - a speciality of the town of Arbroath in Angus, Scotland.  History  The Arbroath Smokie is said to have originated in the small fishing village of Auchmithie, three miles northeast of Arbroath. Local legend has it a store caught fire one night, destroying barrels of haddock preserved in salt. The following morning, the people found some of the barrels had caught fire, cooking the haddock inside. Inspection revealed the haddock to be quite tasty. It is much more likely the villagers were of Scandinavian descent, as the 'Smokie making' process is similar to smoking methods which are still employed in areas of Scandinavia. Towards the end of the 19th century, as Arbroath's fishing industry died, the Town Council offered the fisherfolk from Auchmithie land in an area of the town known as the fit o' the toon. It also offered them use of the modern harbour. Much of the Auchmithie population then relocated, bringing the Arbroath Smokie recipe with them. Today, some 15 local businesses produce Arbroath smokies, selling them in major supermarkets in the UK and online. In 2004, the European Commission registered the designation \\"Arbroath smokies\\" as a Protected Geographical Indication under the EU's Protected Food Name Scheme, acknowledging its unique status.Wilson, Neil and Murphy, Alan (2008) Scotland Page 240, Lonely Planet. .

There are still smokehouses in back gardens to produce the Arbroath smokie Preparation Arbroath smokies are prepared using traditional methods dating back to the late 1800s. The fish are first salted overnight. They are then tied in pairs using hemp twine, and left overnight to dry. Once they have been salted, tied and dried, they are hung over a triangular length of wood to smoke. This \\"kiln stick\\" fits between the two tied smokies, one fish on either side. The sticks are then used to hang the dried fish in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire. When the fish are hung over the fire, the top of the barrel is covered with a lid and sealed around the edges with wet jute sacks (the water prevents the jute sacks from catching fire). All of this serves to create a very hot, humid and smoky fire. The intense heat and thick smoke is essential if the fish are to be cooked, not burned, and to have the strong, smoky taste and smell people expect from Arbroath smokies. Typically in less than an hour of smoking, the fish are ready to eat.

Historically the village developed around farming based mainly on the rearing of cattle on the fertile flood plains. In more recent times Tockington has become an attractive location for commuters, being situated within the Green Belt and well connected with Bristol. It is south of Olveston and is located in a steep valley. The village also has the Swan Inn, a popular pub. The centre of the village, where the pub is located is a triangular junction.  History  In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Tockington like this: TOCKINGTON (Lower), a tything in Almondsbury parish, Gloucester; 3¬æ miles S by E of Thornbury. It has a post- office under Bristol, and cattle fairs on 9 May and 6 Dec. Real property, ¬£4,975. Pop., 464. Houses, 109.  Tockington Manor  Tockington Manor Tockington Manor is a boarding preparatory school, which opened in 1947. The three-storey stone building was largely constructed around 1712 but incorporating elements of an earlier house. In World War I it was used as a hospital. Before WWII it was privately owned by the Salmon family. At the outbreak of war it was commandeered as a dispersal site for the Bristol Engine Company's design office. The estimated cost, largely for building a number of additional huts in the grounds, of ¬£9,000 was considered too much, so the main office staff were instead moved to the Fry's chocolate factory at Somerdale and only leading staff and their support staff, a total of 70, went to the Manor. Apartments were made for senior staff and after Roy Fedden, Bristol's chief designer, was coincidentally bombed out of his house in Bristol on 25 September 1940, during a raid targeted on Bristol's Filton factory, he took up permanent residence. Close House, Upper Tockington Road, was also used as a lodging house. The pre-war garden staff were kept on, now digging for victory to supply the kitchens. The Tockington Manor office was where new engine developments were first planned. One of these had major significance, as Bristol's first gas turbine engine, the Theseus turboprop. This was a source of great disagreement, as Fedden thought that Bristol should concentrate on existing piston engines, but was over-ruled by Frank Owner, Head of the Project Office. This led to Fedden's resignation in 1942, at the height of the war. Towards the end of the war, once the threat of air raids was over, the design office returned to Filton and afterwards the house was returned to the Salmon family. They sold the estate in 1946. The Manor was bought by ex first- class cricketer Major Tovey, who began it as a private school. His son, Richard, later served as headmaster of the school for 38 years.  Tockington Quarry  There is a small limestone quarry to the rear of the Manor. Along with the Manor this formed part of the pre-war Salmon estate. During the war, it was considered to use this quarry as an isolated and enclosed place for engine testing. In the end, Failand Quarry to the south-west was used instead. The quarry is now a climbing site. Amenities The hub of the village is 'The Green' and where its church, pub and bus stop are all located. Next to the Swan Inn, a Grade II Listed Building, is an old style red phone box and which is used as a book swap. The village church: Olveston and Tockington Methodist Church was formed in 2004 when the two former village churches united. The church, in the form of a Chapel, was built in 1897. The Chapel was extensively renovated in 2007 and now incorporates a toilet with disabled access and a kitchenette. At full capacity the Chapel seats 60. Its minister from 1 September 2018 is the Rev Simon Edwards. Services are held in the Chapel on Sundays at 10:00 am. Church facilities: Opposite the Swan pub are the Wesley Rooms, which are extensively used by groups and organisations within the community, with good kitchen facilities, loos, and disabled access. Tockington has no shops however there are several farm shops in the surrounding area. There are also supermarkets and a large shopping mall at nearby Cribbs Causeway as well as those in the nearby town of Thornbury. Bus services to and from Tockington are operated by Stagecoach Group Gloucester. Current buses are: ( >: route sequence) 411: Severn Beach > Tockington > Thornbury.

The ICR adopts the Bible as an inerrant and literal documentary of scientific and historical fact as well as religious and moral truths, and espouses a Young Earth creationist worldview. It rejects evolutionary biology, which it views as a corrupting moral and social influence and threat to religious belief. The ICR was formed by Henry M. Morris in 1972 following an organizational split with the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC). Its work in the field of creation science has been rejected by mainstream science, but has been significant in shaping creationist thought in the United States by introducing creation science through fundamentalist churches and religious schools, and by engaging in public debates against supporters of evolution. The ICR also offers unaccredited graduate level programs in Biblical Apologetics, including a minor in Creation Research. The ICR also operates the ICR Discovery Center for Science & Earth History museum in Dallas, Texas. History Institute for Creation Research in Santee, CA. The origins of the ICR can be traced to the Creation Science Research Center set up by Henry M. Morris, along with Nell and Kelly Segraves, at the Christian Heritage College (now San Diego Christian College) in 1970. However, the Segraveses and Morris disagreed on the focus of the center, with the Segraveses favoring political and promotional activities, whilst Morris favored educational and scientific efforts. This led to the breakup of the center in 1972, with the Segraveses taking control of the center and severing ties with the university, with Morris reorganising the remaining staff into the Institute for Creation Research.. The ICR defined its work in terms of three ministries: research, writing and speaking. Historian of science Ronald L. Numbers states that \\"[d]espite its name, the institute for years conducted little research outside the confines of its modest library\\" and cites (founding member) Duane Gish as \\"explain[ing] apologetically in 1978, [that] the staff devoted much of its research effort to scouring the scientific literature for references favorable to creationism.\\" Numbers does note that it engaged in a number of archaeological and geological expeditions, including two in search of the mythical Noah's Ark, with geologist Steven A. Austin, working as an \\"off and on\\" visiting scientist until taking a full staff position in 1979, single-handedly conducting most of its non-literary research. Influential scientific creationist Walter E. Lammerts complained that \\"[t]he main trouble is that Henry looks at this whole thing as a sort of 'missionary' effort rather than a scientific one.\\" It maintained tax-exempt status as a religious institution carrying out \\"non-scientific research.\\" In the early 1980s the ICR severed its ties with Christian Heritage College to downplay its religious connections and portray itself as secular scientific institution. Ken Ham, a speaker and former high school science teacher in Australia, once worked for the ICR producing a series of seminars \\"Back to Genesis\\". In 1994 Ham left ICR to found what would become Answers in Genesis (AiG). Currently, at least one ICR staff member is also on staff at AiG.Andrew Snelling biography, Answers in Genesis In 1985, the ICR helped Turkey's education minister Vehbi Din√ßerler, introduce Islamic creationism in Turkish high schools. In 1987, the ICR's statement of belief was cited in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Edwards v. Aguillard. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote that \\"If no valid secular purpose can be identified, then the statute violates the Establishment Clause.\\" He continued noting information on ICR and Creation Research Society including \\"a review of their goals and activities sheds light on the nature of creation science.\\" He then explained, \\"the intent of the Louisiana Legislature was to promote a particular religious belief\\" and the court ruled that teaching creationism was unconstitutional. In 1992, the ICR opened the Museum of Creation and Earth History. When the ICR moved from Santee, California to Dallas, Texas, the ICR sold the museum to the Life and Light Foundation, a non-profit ministry run by Tom Cantor, in 2008. With the Creation Research Society, ICR released statements in 2005 about the RATE (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth) project, providing a young-Earth creationist perspective on dating techniques like radiometric dating. RATE claimed that evidence supported over 500 million years of radiometric decay at today's rates but that it also supported a young earth. It speculated that nuclear decay rates must have accelerated by a factor of approximately one billion on the first two days of the Creation week and during the Flood. Non-affiliated experts who have scrutinised the claims have unanimously rejected them as flawed, noting that the integrity of science was compromised in favor of a message affirming the reliability of the Bible. RATE was chaired by Larry Vardiman and included Steven A. Austin, John Baumgardner, Steven W. Boyd, Eugene F. Chaffin, Donald B. DeYoung, Russell Humphreys and Andrew Snelling. In 2007, the institute relocated from Santee, California, to Dallas, Texas. Morris, who died the previous year, said the move was intended to give the ICR a central national location, Dallas' proximity to a major airport, and a larger population for their ministry. For FYE 2007, the Institute had net assets of $7,613,461. In 2009, the ICR had a revenue of $8,042,283 with net assets of $9,857,656. On September 2, 2019, the ICR opened the ICR Discovery Center for Science & Earth History museum in Dallas, Texas. Research and publications In a 1995 review of work published by ICR researchers, Douglas J. Futuyma writes, \\"Neither in the creationist literature nor in the scientific literature have I found any reference to professional research by these individuals in genetics, paleontology, taxonomy, anatomy, or any of the other fields most relevant to the study of evolution.\\" He found their work most often published instead by an overtly religious publishing house, Creation-Life Publishers. Master Books Master Books is a division within Creation-Life Publishers, another enterprise Morris helped to found. It serves as the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and specializes in theology and creation science works. Master Books' anti-evolution books are in wide distribution, promoted by most of the large creationist organizations as well as the ICR. School and accreditation In June 1981, the ICR received formal state approval in California to offer degree programs in science. In 1988, the ICR sought re-approval. A five-person committee from the California Department of Education sent to evaluate ICR's degree program found its graduate school consisted of only five full-time faculty and some courses were videotaped rather than professor-led instruction. The committee failed to grant re- approval by 3‚Äì2 vote, a move the ICR attributed to \\"religious intolerance\\" rather than criticisms of the quality of education it provided. This resulted in California's State Superintendent of Public Instruction barring the institute from granting master's degrees in science, which encompassed their existing graduate degree programs in the teaching of biology, geology, astrogeophysics and science. ICR filed a lawsuit against California's State Superintendent, Bill Honig, and was awarded a settlement of $225,000 and given permission to continue its program until 1995 so long as it continued to teach evolution alongside creationism. The original agreement expired in 1995, and California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE) granted the ICR religious exemption from postsecondary school requirements in California.Guide to California Colleges and Universities-Institute For Creation Research, Retrieved on 2007-11-26 In 1982, the ICR received accreditation from the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), a private fundamentalist creationist schools accreditation agency. TRACS was officially recognized as an accreditor by the US Department of Education in 1991. Following the ICR's move to Dallas, in November 2007, TRACS terminated its accredited status. Texas does not recognize TRACS' accreditation. The ICR's relocation to Texas required Texas state approval or accreditation by a regional accrediting agency, in this case Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). In 2007, the ICR applied for a temporary state certification there which would have allowed the institute to operate while it pursues accreditation through SACS. In December 2007, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) received an advisory committee recommendation to allow the ICR to start offering online master's degrees in science education. The Board originally planned to decide on the issue at their January 2008 meeting. At the time it applied, ICR graduate school had approximately 30 to 50 students, most teachers from private Christian schools or home-schoolers, and four full-time faculty. After seeking the advice from an independent panel, the Chairman of the Texas Board requested information about the research conducted by the faculty, how an on- line program would expose students to the experimental side of science, and asked why \\"[t]heir curriculum doesn't line up very well with the curriculum available in conventional master of science programs.\\" Subsequently, the ICR asked the THECB to delay its decision until their next meeting, on April 24, 2008 to give them time to respond. Inside Higher Ed reported \\"lobbying ‚Äî by scientists against the institute, and by others in its favor ‚Äî is going strong.\\"Inside Higher Ed, January 25, 2008. The Dallas Morning News obtained some of the messages sent to the board and published a number of examples and summaries that illustrated how intense the debate had become.\\"Creationist institute's master's science degree proposal creates debate,\\" Dallas Morning News, January 23, 2008. Following the response from the ICR to the Board, Steven Schafersman, of the Texas Citizens for Science, reported that the ICR sent out \\"prayer requests\\" and is currently arguing a creationist derived distinction of science in their application for approval. On April 23, 2008, education board's Academic Excellence and Research Committee unanimously voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees citing \\"the institute's program is infused with creationism and runs counter to conventions of science that hold that claims of supernatural intervention are not testable and therefore lie outside the realm of science.\\" On the following day the full Board unanimously voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees. The decision was \\"based the recommendation on two considerations: # ICR failed to demonstrate that the proposed degree program meets acceptable standards of science and science education. #The proposed degree is inconsistent with Coordinating Board rules which require the accurate labeling or designation of programs ‚Ä¶ Since the proposed degree program inadequately covers key areas of science, it cannot be properly designated either as 'science' or 'science education.'\\" The ICR said it would appeal the decision saying the Education Board was guilty of \\"viewpoint discrimination.\\" Instead, in April 2009, the ICR sued the THECB in federal court for imposing \\"an unconstitutional and prejudicial burden against ICRGS's academic freedom and religious liberties\\" and asked for the ability to award science degrees. In June 2010, a judge ruled in favor of the Texas Higher Education saying the ICR \\"is entirely unable to file a complaint which is not overly verbose, disjointed, incoherent, maundering and full of irrelevant information.\\" The judge concluded, \\"The Court simply comes to the conclusion, which is inescapable, that the [THECB] decision was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\\" In the September 2010 ICR newsletter, Henry Morris III, the ICR's chief executive officer, wrote \\"ICR's legal battle is over\\" after the Judge ruled in favor of the Texas Board. In 2010, the ICR board of directors voted to close the ICR Graduate School and open a School of Biblical Apologetics, offering a Master of Christian Education degree with Creation Research being one of four minors. The ICR noted that \\"Due to the nature of ICR's School of Biblical Apologetics ‚Äî a predominantly religious education school ‚Äî it is exempt from licensing by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Criticism =Scientific criticism= Young-earth creationism is rejected by nearly all scientists, including most scientists who hold to Christian faith As reported by Newsweek: \\"By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly',\\" in \\"Keeping God out of the Classroom (Washington and bureau reports)\\", Larry Martz & Ann McDaniel, Newsweek CIX(26): 23‚Äì24, June 29, 1987, ISSN 0028-9604\\"Creationism claims to be based on scientific rigour. In reality the methods employed by creationists are of three types: purely dogmatic assertions; distorted use of scientific quotations, sometimes illustrated with magnificent photographs; and backing from more or less well- known scientists, most of whom are not specialists in these matters\\". with more than 45 science organizations having criticized creationism as not science. Professor Massimo Pigliucci, a professor of ecology and evolution at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, has criticized ICR for professing to present the same science as that taught in secular universities while at the same time requiring students and faculty to sign a statement of faith to ICR's fundamentalist religious mission, most notably in affirming conformity in all its work to Biblical doctrine. Pigliucci notes that any research conducted within the ICR's policy framework is prescribed at the outset by Biblical literalism, and thus antithetical to the methods and framework used by scientists. As examples, Pigliucci cites ICR scientist Harold Slusher resorting to non-Euclidean and non-Einsteinian explanations of light travel to reconcile the vast distances light travels in space with the brief timescale given in young earth creationism, and the association adopted by the ICR between the second principle of thermodynamics and the Bible's account of the fall of Adam. Pigliucci further claimed that \\"some of the historical claims found in the ICR museum are also stunning and show how easily ideology gets the better of accuracy.\\" On January 7, 2007 the National Center for Science Education reported that Grand Canyon: A Different View, edited by Tom Vail and published by Master Books, the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and described as promoting \\"a young-earth creationist view of the geology of the Grand Canyon,\\" was facing new scrutiny by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) in December 2006. The Chief of the Park Service's Geologic Resources Division recommended its removal on grounds that it \\"does not use accurate, professional and scholarly knowledge; is not based on science but a specific religious doctrine; does not further the public's understanding of the Grand Canyon's existence; [and] does not further the mission of the National Park Service\\". A report by the National Center for Science Education, written by Chemist Karen Bartelt was critical of the ICR representatives and displays in the \\"museum.\\" =Criticism from old Earth creationists= Old Earth creationists are opposed to the ICR. Gary North \\"opposes the ICR on the grounds that they\\" think the second principle of thermodynamics contradicts evolution, and John W. Robbins considers the ICR's activities a \\"fraud.\\" The old-Earth creationist organization Answers In Creation criticizes the ICR, including a critical review by Kevin R. Henke of the ICR's dating claims. Henke concluded that the ICR's \\"research\\" was improperly conducted and \\"was unsuccessful in adequately separating the volcanic glass from the much older minerals.\\" Another creationist opponent of ICR and its doctrine is Hugh Ross, who accepts the scientific consensus of a 4.54 billion year old Earth and is critical of ICR's cosmological models as well as their attempts to solve the starlight problem. =Criticism over awarding degrees= The ICR attracted much opposition when it sought approval (unsuccessfully) in Texas to operate a master's degree program in science education. An April 2008 survey by Texas Freedom Network showed the majority of science faculties in Texas are opposed to ICR's request to issue science degrees with 185 (95% of respondents) opposed to certifying the program and 6 (3%) in favor. Officials of the institute state their goal is to integrate Biblical creationism with science. Since their program is intended to prepare students who are or will become teachers, the developing program is controversial. In public statements ICR officials say that scientific literacy would be emphasized, but science advocates critical of the ICR say the institute's true goal is to restore religious creationism to science classes in the public schools. Texas declined to accredit the ICR science program (see above).

His most popular works were written in 1890‚Äì1895 and set in late 16th and early 17th-century France. While very successful at the time, they are now largely forgotten. Biography Stanley John Weyman was born on 7 August 1855 in Ludlow, Shropshire, the second son of a solicitor. He attended Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford, leaving in 1877 with a degree in Modern History. After a year's teaching at the King's School, Chester, he returned to Ludlow in December 1879 to live with his widowed mother. Weyman was called to the bar in 1881, but had little success as a barrister, as he was shy, nervous and soft-spoken. However, his shortage of briefs gave him time to write. His short story \\"King Pippin and Sweet Clive\\" appeared in the Cornhill Magazine, although its editor, James Payn, himself a novelist, told Weyman it would be easier to make a living writing novels. Weyman viewed himself as a historian and so he was particularly encouraged by positive notices for an article he wrote on Oliver Cromwell that was published in the English Historical Review. Weyman's ill-health prompted him in 1885 to spend several months in the South of France with his younger brother Arthur. In December of that year the brothers were arrested on suspicion of espionage at Aramits. A 24-page critical biography of Weyman published as an annex to an edition of his novel Ovington's Bank (1922) suggests that this ordeal galvanised the thirty-year-old Weyman, who until then had scraped a meagre income writing short stories. His first novel, The House of the Wolf, was published in 1889. Like many of his successful works, it is set in the French religious wars of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He became a full-time writer in 1891. Four years later he married Charlotte Panting at Great Fransham, Norfolk and moved with her to Ruthin in Wales where he lived for the rest of his life. Weyman died on 10 April 1928, his wife surviving him by four years; they had no children. Reputation Weyman in his day was immensely popular and admired by Robert Louis Stevenson and Oscar Wilde. In a 1970 BBC interview, Graham Greene said, \\"The key books in my life included Anthony Hope, Rider Haggard, Captain Gilson and I do occasionally re-read them. Stanley Weyman in particular.\\"Graham Greene in Ronald Bryden, \\"Graham Greene Discusses Collected Edition of His Novels\\", The Listener, 23 April 1970; reprinted in Henry J. Donaghy, Conversations with Graham Greene, University Press of Mississippi, 1992, p. 85. Works like The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas had established a market for popular historical fiction and it was a crowded field. Contemporary rivals included Baroness Orczy, A. E. W. Mason, John Buchan and Rafael Sabatini. The biographer Reginald Pound grouped Weyman with Arnold Bennett, Anthony Hope, Aldous Huxley, Dorothy L. Sayers and Somerset Maugham as Strand writers. He is now perhaps the least familiar of all these. His greatest success came before 1895 (Under the Red Robe, A Gentleman of France and The Red Cockade) and he stopped writing entirely between 1908 and 1919. His style and focus are more typical of Victorian writers, as are his faults. With odd exceptions such as Gil de Berault in Under the Red Robe, his characters are fairly uniform, his women caricatures, and his dialogue wooden to modern ears. Weyman's strength lies in historical detail, often in less familiar areas. The Long Night is based on the Duke of Savoy's attempt to storm Geneva in December 1602, an event still celebrated annually in a festival called L'Escalade. Weyman received an award from the city for his research. The financial security of early success allowed him to choose subjects of personal interest. Some had less general appeal, such as the 1832 Reform Bill (treated in Chippinge), post-1815 industrialisation (Starvecrow Farm) or the 1825 financial crisis (Ovington's Bank, reprinted in 2012 and 2015 on the back of a similar crisis in 2008). Luck also plays a part. The reputation of many of his contemporaries now rests on one book, e. g. The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Four Feathers, or The Prisoner of Zenda. His close friend and equally successful author Hugh Stowell, who wrote as H. Seton Merriman, has also been largely forgotten. Weyman called his own books \\"pleasant fables\\" and was aware of their modest literary value.

Fletching is the fin-shaped aerodynamic stabilization device attached on arrows, crossbow bolts or darts, typically made from light, semi- flexible materials such as feathers. Each piece of such fin is a fletch, also known as a flight or feather. A fletcher is a person who attaches fletchings to the shaft of arrows. The word is related to the French word fl√®che, meaning \\"arrow\\", via the ultimate root of Old Frankish fliukka. Description As a noun, \\"fletching\\" refers collectively to the fins or vanes, each of which individually is known as a fletch. Traditionally, the fletching consists of three matched half-feathers attached near the back of the arrow or shaft of the dart that are equally spaced around its circumference. Four fletchings were also used historically. In English archery, the male feather, from a cock, is used on the outside of the arrow, while the other two stabilizing feathers are from a female, or hen. Traditional archery lore about feather curvature is that a right handed archer should shoot a right winged feather and right handed helical, and a left handed archer should use the opposite. Slow motion cameras show the arrow does not begin to spin until it is well past the riser, and the most important point is to have consistency in fletching. Shooting a feathered arrow with a bow with a riser shelf, instead of a plastic vane, is wiser since the feathers will compress and flatten while coming off the bow.Lauber, Lon E. Bowhunter's Guide to Accurate Shooting. Chanhassen, Minn: Creative Pub. International, 2005. Pages 37-38. On compound bows, feathers may be a hindrance, and plastic vanes are a better solution. At the high speeds coming off a compound bow, plastic vanes with no curvature still allow the arrow to fly straight without tumbling. Also, noise is increased with feathers on these higher-powered bows, which can be a problem for hunters.Meade, Jason. 2017. \\"Straight, 4¬∫ Offset, or Helical? Vanes or Feathers? How should I Fletch my arrows?\\" From Behind the Counter. Today, modern plastics may be used instead. Fletches were traditionally attached with glue and silk thread, but with modern glue/thread/tape this is no longer necessary, unless the arrow is a reproduction of a historical arrow. The fletching is used to stabilize the arrow aerodynamically. Feather fletches impart a natural spin on an arrow due to the rough and smooth sides of a feather and the natural curve, determined by which wing the feather came from. Vanes need to be placed at a slight angle (called an offset fletch), or set into a twist (called a helical fletch) to create the same effect, but all are there to impart stability to the projectile to ensure that the projectile does not tumble during flight. More generally, \\"fletching\\" can refer to any structures added to a projectile to aerodynamically stabilize its flight, many of which resemble arrows in form and function. For instance, the feathers at the butt end of a dart (of the type cast using an atlatl) are very similar in purpose and construction to those used in arrows. Most of the techniques of fletching were likely adapted from earlier dart-making techniques. The fins used to stabilize rockets work in a similar manner. Plastic fletching (also known as vanes) ‚Äì this example is parabolic cut with pink hen vanes (the ones put oblique to the bow when nocked on the string) and a green cock (the one ‚Äì or ones, with even-numbered vanes ‚Äì put perpendicular to it).

A storage heater or heat bank (Australia) is an electrical heater which stores thermal energy during the evening, or at night when electricity is available at lower cost, and releases the heat during the day as required. Principle of operation Storage heaters are typically composed of clay bricks or other ceramic material (grog), of concrete walls, or of water containers. There are also special materials such as feolite. This material serves as a heat storage medium. There are electrical heating elements embedded in the material which can be switched on to heat the storage medium and thus to store energy. The stored heat is given off continuously (through thermal radiation and convection). To speed up the heat transfer, storage heaters may come equipped with mechanical fans that can move air through the heater; see the section on fan-assisted storage heaters.  Types of storage heater  = High heat retention storage heaters = High heat retention storage heaters (HHRSH) are the newest and most advanced storage heaters on the market. Dimplex pioneered this technology with the Quantum, which led to a new category being created in SAP. The UK government approved software which calculates the heating system that can be used in a new building or refurbishment. High heat retention storage heaters are able to retain more heat than traditional storage heaters, with a minimum of 45% heat retention 24 hours after a full charge. This significantly reduces the heat wasted during the day, and is achieved through improved insulation. High heat retention storage heaters also include smart controls and monitor climatic conditions to estimate future heat demand, making them much more responsive to changes in their environment than traditional storage heaters. All high heat retention storage heaters are also Lot 20 compliant, in line with the EcoDesign regulations which came into force on 1 January 2018.  Regulations  Lot 20 is an EU legislation that was designed to remove inefficient heating technologies from the market and reduce the energy used by products that heat our homes. The goal of the legislation is to achieve the UK's overall carbon reduction targets and has been in place since 1 January 2018. It states that all installed electric heating products manufactured from 1 January 2018 must have an electronic thermostat with a 24-hour, 7-day timer with either adaptive start or an open window sensor. Storage heaters must include: an electronic heat charge control with room and/or outdoor temperature feedback or controlled by energy supplier, an electronic room temperature control plus week timer and a fan assisted output. Optional additional compliance features are distance control, adaptive start and open window detection. Non-compliant stock that was manufactured before this date may still be sold.  Application  A two-tariff electricity meter which records separately the electricity used during the off-peak period so that it can be billed at a lower rate. Storage heaters are usually used in conjunction with a two-tariff electricity meter which records separately the electricity used during the off-peak period so that it can be billed at a lower rate. In order to enjoy the lower rates, the house must be on a special electricity tariff. In most countries, storage heaters are only economical (compared to other forms of heating) when used with such a special tariff. In the United Kingdom the Economy 7 tariff is appropriate. Storage heaters usually have two controls: a charge control (often called \\"input\\"), which controls the amount of heat stored, and the draught control (often called \\"output\\"), which controls the rate at which heat is released. These controls may be controlled by the user, or may operate automatically once the user selects the target room temperature on a thermostat. Storage heaters may also incorporate an electric heater (utilizing either resistance heaters or heat pumps), which can be used to increase heat output. Such added heating, if it is resistance heating, is expensive, as it occurs during the high-tariff time of day. Comparison to other heating systems =Advantages= *Storage heaters, while often still more expensive than equivalent gas- or oil-fired heating systems, are cheaper than running the same amount of electrical heating using electricity at regular daytime rates. *Users of gas central heating & some other systems often turn off the heating during the night as an economy measure, with the result that the house is cold at night and early morning; but because night storage heaters are on at night, the house is still warm at those times. *Using storage heaters allows houses to be sited in areas where natural-gas distribution systems are not available, without requiring the homeowners to pay higher daytime electrical-heating bills. *The capital cost of night storage heating is relatively low, and installation is far easier than the initial installation of gas-fired boilers, piping and radiators. This is an important advantage when renovating old buildings without existing central heating. *As compared to gas central heating systems, night storage heaters have next to no maintenance costs. =Disadvantages= *Heat is lost from the heater while charging overnight. The room is warm in the morning, but this is because it has wastefully been heated all night. *The heat stored during the night will be released into the living area during the next day, regardless of need (due to the inevitable heat transfer through the storage heater's insulation). Thus if the homeowner is unexpectedly absent that day (and therefore does not need the house to be warmed) or is only at home for a small part of the day, the heat has already been purchased and is already there, and eventually comes out. *The storage heater can only heat with the energy stored the night before. Thus if the system was switched off or if the charge control was set too low, there may not be sufficient energy to heat the rooms, and this can only be corrected for the next day. This is a problem for example when the weather turns cold unexpectedly, or when returning from a vacation late at night, or users simply not thinking to change the settings because they are at a comfortable temperature. Some heaters alleviate this problem by also allowing heating during the day, but this is typically expensive (because the electricity is charged at full rate). Even under the best of circumstances it can be difficult to accurately judge how to set the thermostats as setting them too low overnight can cause the heater to be having no perceived effect while setting them at maximum will increase the cost of running them. Similarly in systems where every heater must be set individually, incorrectly setting one room's heater can make the whole house feel too cold. *Many users may not fully understand the controls. A common error is leaving the output (or boost) control open at night, so that the heaters dissipate heat when they should be storing it, with a consequent increase in electricity consumption and cost. Alternatively they may set the input control to minimum at night instead of the output, which can mean there is no heat at all for the next day. *Sizing a storage heater is a compromise between the maximum expected cold-spell intensity and duration, and the cost and space requirement of the heater. If the heater is too large, its cost will be excessive and it will impact on the building's available area; if too small, the cost of supplemental (daytime) electrical heating will be excessive. * Storage heaters are very heavy and somewhat bulky, due to the material used to store heat. They typically take up more floor space than the radiators used in most other heating systems. * In countries where electricity is deregulated and electricity companies can compete with each other, such as the United Kingdom, it was possible for a company to achieve vendor lock-in by installing a non-standard version of the multi-rate meter, instead of using an industry standard such as Economy 7. If a non-standard meter is installed then switching energy supplier for a better deal could be prohibitively expensive because the meter may have needed to be replaced first. However, following an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, an Order was issued to allow these consumers to switch to a single rate tariff without the need to change their meter, or incurring any additional charges by switching to a single rate (such as having to pay two standing charges). *When the fan is used to speed up heat transfer, the air circulation will increase the amount of airborne dust in the heated room. This can be a problem for people with allergies. Therefore, central heating is a better source of heat for allergy sufferers.Klima sucht Schutz: Nachtspeicherheizung article on storage heaters (German) This can be avoided by not using the fan, but then it is no longer possible to regulate the heat transfer.  Using storage heaters  Storage heaters can be cost-effective if used properly, but they require more attention than fuel-fired systems. = Power switches = Storage heaters can provide two power circuits, one for on-peak and one for off-peak electricity, and two power switches, which are switched off during the summer when heat is not required. During other months the off-peak switch can be left on at all times, with the on-peak switch being used when insufficient energy has been stored during off-peak times. The amount of heat that is stored can be altered using the controls on the storage heater unit. Normally the on-peak will have a fuse as it is part of another circuit. The off-peak will just be a switch as it has a dedicated circuit. = Basic controls = Basic storage heaters have an input switch, and an output switch, called heat boost on some models. The position of the input switch may be changed to reflect how cold the next day is predicted to be. The input switch is normally thermostatic, cutting off the charge when the room reaches a certain temperature overnight.Dimplex CXLSN Operating Instructions page 2 The exact setting needed will depend on the size of the storage heater, the desired room temperature during the day, the number of hours that this needs to be maintained, and the room's rate of heat loss under a given set of circumstances. Some experimenting may be needed to find the relationship between forecast outside temperature and best input setting for a particular room. Most storage heater users follow simpler guidelines; for example, in the middle of winter, it is often appropriate to turn the input switch to its maximum setting. There is no need to touch the input switch on a daily basis if the same sort of weather prevails for weeks at a time. There is no need to touch the input switch during the day, as storage heaters only use electricity at night. The output switch may require attention throughout the day. Before going to bed, the operator should switch the output to its minimum setting. This keeps as much heat in the bricks as possible. Enough will leak out into the room to make it warm in the morning. Only in exceptionally cold circumstances will the operator require output overnight. The operator may wish to slowly increase the output switch during the day to try to maintain the temperature in the house. Increasing the output will allow the heat to convect out of the heater. If the house is empty during the day, the output should be left at a minimum all day and then switched up when returning to the house in order to let more heat escape. Many storage heaters also have a mechanically-controlled automatic output switch. In this case, if the manual output switch is not set to minimum overnight, the damper will automatically close (as if the output switch had been set to minimum), and then the damper will re-open after a time delay; this time delay is measured by the gradual drop in the heater's core temperature, and is therefore longer if the core temperature started higher due to more charge. The delay can also be biased by the output switch's setting.Dimplex CXLSN Operating Instructions page 3 Some output switches that are set up this way are marked \\"early\\" and \\"late\\" as well as \\"closed\\" and \\"open\\"; the minimum \\"closed\\" setting corresponds with \\"early\\" and the maximum \\"open\\" setting corresponds with \\"late\\". These output switches can be controlled manually by ensuring they are closed at night and opened when desired, or they can be left to automatic operation by not closing at night. = Thermostatic controls = A thermostatic storage heater will automatically regulate the temperature in a room throughout the day. However, the operator may wish to switch the thermostatic switch to the minimum setting overnight to lower the room temperature. If the room is empty during the day, it is better to keep the thermostat at the minimum setting and then increase the setting when the room is occupied in the evening. Some thermostatic heaters also make use of on-peak electricity when there is not enough stored heat to maintain the requested temperature; the user may wish to be aware of this and lower the settings. = Fan-assisted storage heaters = Fan-assisted storage heaters employ an electric fan to drive air through the heater rather than relying on convection. The fan is usually controlled by a thermostat which allows the user to set the desired room temperature. The use of the fan means these heaters can be insulated more than other models, and therefore lose less heat due to heat transfer at times when heat is not required (such as when the room is not occupied, or at night). Environmental aspects In common with other forms of direct electric heating, storage heaters are not necessarily environmentally friendly because the source of electricity may be generated using fossil fuels, with up to two-thirds of energy in the fuel lost at the power station and in transmission losses. In Sweden the use of direct electric heating has been restricted since the 1980s for this reason, and there are plans to phase it out entirely‚Äîsee Oil phase-out in Sweden‚Äîwhile Denmark and Germany have banned the installation of electric space heating in new buildings for similar reasons (though in Germany the ban was lifted in 2013).EnEV 2009: ¬ß 10a Au√üerbetriebnahme von elektrischen Speicherheizsystemen. from: enev-online.org (in German) In the UK, a storage heater earns a \\"Poor\\" rating for Environmental Performance on an Energy Performance Certificate. However many progressive countries are developing their electricity generating system, principally, to incorporate \\"greener\\", more sustainable and renewable energy sources; so how \\"green\\" a storage heater system is would in principle depend on how the electricity used is generated. Of course this argument applies to all forms of electric heating, but the ability of a storage heater system to use electricity at times when, for example, wind generated electricity could not otherwise be used, may in conjunction with a smart grid give storage heating a new role in the future. In some countries, the current design of the electrical generating system may result in a surplus of electricity from base load power stations during off- peak periods, and storage heaters may then be able to make use of this surplus to increase the net efficiency of the system as a whole. However, future changes in supply and demand‚Äîfor example as a result of energy conservation measures or a more responsive generating system‚Äîmay then reverse this situation, with storage heaters preventing a reduction in the national base load. Other technologies may incorporate demand response electronics to sense when there is a change in supply and demand. Thereby, they ensure that these loads only use off-peak electricity. Further advances in supply technology could provide for a more bespoke 'supply and demand' tariff system to make smart grid sensing technologies like dynamic demand a more viable financial prospect. Compared to other forms of electric heating, storage heaters are cheaper to run and they impose lower peak loads. The highest peak loads come from instantaneous electric heating, such as immersion water heaters, which create heavy loads for short durations, although instantaneous water heaters may use less electricity overall. High-efficiency ground source heat pumps are able to use up to 66% less electricity than storage heaters in heating by recovering heat from the ground, and are regarded as preferable even though they use electricity throughout the day.The Green Electricity Illusion (Table 3, page 15) , AECB, published 2005-11-11, accessed 2007-05-26. These are not to be confused with air conditioning (A/C) heat pumps which are now considered to be an environmental liability in some, (in particular hotter climate), countries. Where alternatives to electricity exist, hot-water central heating systems can use water heated in or close to the building using high-efficiency condensing boilers, biofuels, heat pumps or district heating. Ideally hot water heating should be used. This can be converted in the future to use other technologies such as solar panels, so also providing future-proofing. In the case of new buildings, low-energy buildings such as those built to the Passive House standard can eliminate almost all the need for conventional space heating systems.

Two separatrices (see text) divide space into four magnetic domains with a separator at the center of the figure. Field lines (and associated plasma) flow inward from above and below the separator, reconnect, and spring outward horizontally. A current sheet (as shown) may be present but is not required for reconnection to occur. This process is not well understood: once started, it proceeds many orders of magnitude faster than predicted by standard models. The evolution of magnetic reconnection during a solar flare.Zhu et al., 2016, ApJ, 821, L29, http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/821/2/L29 Magnetic reconnection is a physical process occurring in highly conducting plasmas in which the magnetic topology is rearranged and magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy, thermal energy, and particle acceleration. Magnetic reconnection occurs on timescales intermediate between slow resistive diffusion of the magnetic field and fast Alfv√©nic timescales. According to simple resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) theory, reconnection happens because the plasma's electrical resistivity near the boundary layer opposes the currents necessary to sustain the change in the magnetic field. The need for such a current can be seen from one of Maxwell's equations, : abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mu \\\\mathbf{J} + \\\\mu \\\\epsilon \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E}}{\\\\partial t}. The resistivity of the current layer allows magnetic flux from either side to diffuse through the current layer, cancelling outflux from the other side of the boundary. When this happens, the plasma is pulled out by magnetic tension along the direction of the magnetic field lines. The resulting drop in pressure pulls more plasma and magnetic flux into the central region, yielding a self-sustaining process. A current problem in plasma physics is that observed reconnection happens much faster than predicted by MHD in high Lundquist number plasmas (i.e. fast magnetic reconnection). Solar flares, for example, proceed 13‚Äì14 orders of magnitude faster than a naive calculation would suggest, and several orders of magnitude faster than current theoretical models that include turbulence and kinetic effects. One possible mechanism to explain the discrepancy is that the electromagnetic turbulence in the boundary layer is sufficiently strong to scatter electrons, raising the plasma's local resistivity. This would allow the magnetic flux to diffuse faster.  Properties  A magnetic reconnection event on the sun. = Physical interpretation = The qualitative description of the reconnection process is such that magnetic field lines from different magnetic domains (defined by the field line connectivity) are spliced to one another, changing their patterns of connectivity with respect to the sources. It is a violation of an approximate conservation law in plasma physics, called Alfv√©n's theorem, and can concentrate mechanical or magnetic energy in both space and time. Solar flares, the largest explosions in the Solar System, may involve the reconnection of large systems of magnetic flux on the Sun, releasing, in minutes, energy that has been stored in the magnetic field over a period of hours to days. Magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetosphere is one of the mechanisms responsible for the aurora, and it is important to the science of controlled nuclear fusion because it is one mechanism preventing magnetic confinement of the fusion fuel. In an electrically conductive plasma, magnetic field lines are grouped into 'domains'‚Äî bundles of field lines that connect from a particular place to another particular place, and that are topologically distinct from other field lines nearby. This topology is approximately preserved even when the magnetic field itself is strongly distorted by the presence of variable currents or motion of magnetic sources, because effects that might otherwise change the magnetic topology instead induce eddy currents in the plasma; the eddy currents have the effect of canceling out the topological change. = Types of reconnection = In two dimensions, the most common type of magnetic reconnection is separator reconnection, in which four separate magnetic domains exchange magnetic field lines. Domains in a magnetic plasma are separated by separatrix surfaces: curved surfaces in space that divide different bundles of flux. Field lines on one side of the separatrix all terminate at a particular magnetic pole, while field lines on the other side all terminate at a different pole of similar sign. Since each field line generally begins at a north magnetic pole and ends at a south magnetic pole, the most general way of dividing simple flux systems involves four domains separated by two separatrices: one separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a south pole, and the other separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a north pole. The intersection of the separatrices forms a separator, a single line that is at the boundary of the four separate domains. In separator reconnection, field lines enter the separator from two of the domains, and are spliced one to the other, exiting the separator in the other two domains (see the first figure). In three dimensions, the geometry of the field lines become more complicated than the two-dimensional case and it is possible for reconnection to occur in regions where a separator does not exist, but with the field lines connected by steep gradients. These regions are known as quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), and have been observed in theoretical configurations and solar flares. Theoretical descriptions =Slow reconnection: Sweet‚ÄìParker model= The first theoretical framework of magnetic reconnection was established by Peter Sweet and Eugene Parker at a conference in 1956. Sweet pointed out that by pushing two plasmas with oppositely directed magnetic fields together, resistive diffusion is able to occur on a length scale much shorter than a typical equilibrium length scale.Sweet, P. A., The Neutral Point Theory of Solar Flares, in IAU Symposium 6, Electromagnetic Phenomena in Cosmical Physics, ed. B. Lehnert (Dordrecht: Kluwer), 123, 1958 Parker was in attendance at this conference and developed scaling relations for this model during his return travel. The Sweet‚ÄìParker model describes time-independent magnetic reconnection in the resistive MHD framework when the reconnecting magnetic fields are antiparallel (oppositely directed) and effects related to viscosity and compressibility are unimportant. The initial velocity is simply an E\\\\times B velocity, so : E_y = v_\\\\text{in} B_\\\\text{in} where E_y is the out-of-plane electric field, v_\\\\text{in} is the characteristic inflow velocity, and B_\\\\text{in} is the characteristic upstream magnetic field strength. By neglecting displacement current, the low-frequency Ampere's law, \\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}, gives the relation : J_y \\\\sim \\\\frac{B_\\\\text{in}}{\\\\mu_0\\\\delta}, where \\\\delta is the current sheet half- thickness. This relation uses that the magnetic field reverses over a distance of \\\\sim2\\\\delta. By matching the ideal electric field outside of the layer with the resistive electric field \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma}\\\\mathbf{J} inside the layer (using Ohm's law), we find that : v_\\\\text{in} = \\\\frac{E_y}{B_\\\\text{in}} \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0\\\\sigma\\\\delta} = \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{\\\\delta}, where \\\\eta is the magnetic diffusivity. When the inflow density is comparable to the outflow density, conservation of mass yields the relationship : v_\\\\text{in}L \\\\sim v_\\\\text{out}\\\\delta, where L is the half- length of the current sheet and v_\\\\text{out} is the outflow velocity. The left and right hand sides of the above relation represent the mass flux into the layer and out of the layer, respectively. Equating the upstream magnetic pressure with the downstream dynamic pressure gives : \\\\frac{B_\\\\text{in}^2}{2\\\\mu_0} \\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\rho v_\\\\text{out}^2}{2} where \\\\rho is the mass density of the plasma. Solving for the outflow velocity then gives : v_\\\\text{out} \\\\sim \\\\frac{B_\\\\text{in}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0\\\\rho}} \\\\equiv v_A where v_A is the Alfv√©n velocity. With the above relations, the dimensionless reconnection rate R can then be written in two forms, the first in terms of (\\\\eta, \\\\delta, v_A) using the result earlier derived from Ohm's law, the second in terms of (\\\\delta, L) from the conservation of mass as : R = \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{in}}{v_\\\\text{out}} \\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{v_A\\\\delta} \\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{L}. Since the dimensionless Lundquist number S is given by : S \\\\equiv \\\\frac{Lv_A}{\\\\eta}, the two different expressions of R are multiplied by each other and then square-rooted, giving a simple relation between the reconnection rate R and the Lundquist number S : R ~ \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\eta}{v_A L}} = \\\\frac{1}{S^\\\\frac{1}{2}}. Sweet‚ÄìParker reconnection allows for reconnection rates much faster than global diffusion, but is not able to explain the fast reconnection rates observed in solar flares, the Earth's magnetosphere, and laboratory plasmas. Additionally, Sweet‚ÄìParker reconnection neglects three-dimensional effects, collisionless physics, time- dependent effects, viscosity, compressibility, and downstream pressure. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional magnetic reconnection typically show agreement with this model. Results from the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) of collisional reconnection show agreement with a generalized Sweet‚ÄìParker model which incorporates compressibility, downstream pressure and anomalous resistivity. =Fast reconnection: Petschek model= One of the reasons why Sweet‚ÄìParker reconnection is slow is that the aspect ratio of the reconnection layer is very large in high Lundquist number plasmas. The inflow velocity, and thus the reconnection rate, must then be very small. In 1964, Harry Petschek proposed a mechanism where the inflow and outflow regions are separated by stationary slow mode shocks.Petschek, H. E., Magnetic Field Annihilation, in The Physics of Solar Flares, Proceedings of the AAS-NASA Symposium held 28‚Äì30 October 1963 at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, p. 425, 1964 The aspect ratio of the diffusion region is then of order unity and the maximum reconnection rate becomes : \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{in}}{v_A} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{8 \\\\ln S}. This expression allows for fast reconnection and is almost independent of the Lundquist number. Simulations of resistive MHD reconnection with uniform resistivity showed the development of elongated current sheets in agreement with the Sweet‚ÄìParker model rather than the Petschek model. When a localized anomalously large resistivity is used, however, Petschek reconnection can be realized in resistive MHD simulations. Because the use of an anomalous resistivity is only appropriate when the particle mean free path is large compared to the reconnection layer, it is likely that other collisionless effects become important before Petschek reconnection can be realized. =Anomalous resistivity and Bohm diffusion= In the Sweet‚ÄìParker model, the common assumption is that the magnetic diffusivity is constant. This can be estimated using the equation of motion for an electron with mass m and electric charge e: :{d{\\\\mathbf{v}} \\\\over dt} = {e \\\\over m}\\\\mathbf{E} - u\\\\mathbf{v}, where u is the collision frequency. Since in the steady state, d{\\\\mathbf{v}}/dt = 0, then the above equation along with the definition of electric current, {\\\\mathbf{J}} = en{\\\\mathbf{v}}, where n is the electron number density, yields :\\\\eta = u{c^2 \\\\over \\\\omega_{pi}^2}. Nevertheless, if the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the thermal velocity of plasma, a steady state cannot be achieved and magnetic diffusivity should be much larger than what is given in the above. This is called anomalous resistivity, \\\\eta_\\\\text{anom}, which can enhance the reconnection rate in the Sweet‚ÄìParker model by a factor of \\\\eta_\\\\text{anom}/\\\\eta. Another proposed mechanism is known as the Bohm diffusion across the magnetic field. This replaces the Ohmic resistivity with v_A^2 (mc/eB), however, its effect, similar to the anomalous resistivity, is still too small compared with the observations. =Stochastic reconnection= In stochastic reconnection , magnetic field has a small scale random component arising because of turbulence . For the turbulent flow in the reconnection region, a model for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence should be used such as the model developed by Goldreich and Sridhar in 1995 . This stochastic model is independent of small scale physics such as resistive effects and depends only on turbulent effects . Roughly speaking, in stochastic model, turbulence brings initially distant magnetic field lines to small separations where they can reconnect locally (Sweet-Parker type reconnection) and separate again due to turbulent super-linear diffusion (Richardson diffusion ). For a current sheet of the length L , the upper limit for reconnection velocity is given by :v = v_\\\\text{turb} \\\\; \\\\operatorname{min}\\\\left[\\\\left( {L \\\\over l} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\left( {l \\\\over L} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right], where v_\\\\text{turb} = v_l^2/v_A. Here l, and v_lare turbulence injection length scale and velocity respectively and v_A is the Alfv√©n velocity. This model has been successfully tested by numerical simulations. =Non-MHD process: Collisionless reconnection= On length scales shorter than the ion inertial length c/\\\\omega_{pi} (where \\\\omega_{pi}\\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n_i Z^2 e^2}{\\\\epsilon_0 m_i}} is the ion plasma frequency), ions decouple from electrons and the magnetic field becomes frozen into the electron fluid rather than the bulk plasma. On these scales, the Hall effect becomes important. Two- fluid simulations show the formation of an X-point geometry rather than the double Y-point geometry characteristic of resistive reconnection. The electrons are then accelerated to very high speeds by Whistler waves. Because the ions can move through a wider \\"bottleneck\\" near the current layer and because the electrons are moving much faster in Hall MHD than in standard MHD, reconnection may proceed more quickly. Two-fluid/collisionless reconnection is particularly important in the Earth's magnetosphere.  Observations of magnetic reconnection in nature and the laboratory  =Solar atmosphere= Magnetic reconnection occurs during solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and many other events in the solar atmosphere. The observational evidence for solar flares includes observations of inflows/outflows, downflowing loops, and changes in the magnetic topology. In the past, observations of the solar atmosphere were done using remote imaging; consequently, the magnetic fields were inferred or extrapolated rather than observed directly. However, the first direct observations of solar magnetic reconnection were gathered in 2012 (and released in 2013) by the High Resolution Coronal Imager. =Earth's magnetosphere= Magnetic reconnection events that occur in the Earth's magnetosphere (in the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail) were observed by spacecrafts such as Cluster IIArticles on measurements made from the Cluster II spacecraft mission and the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission. Cluster II is a four-spacecraft mission, with the four spacecraft arranged in a tetrahedron to separate the spatial and temporal changes as the suite flies through space. It has observed numerous reconnection events in which the Earth's magnetic field reconnects with that of the Sun (i.e. the Interplanetary Magnetic Field). These include 'reverse reconnection' that causes sunward convection in the Earth's ionosphere near the polar cusps; 'dayside reconnection', which allows the transmission of particles and energy into the Earth's vicinity and 'tail reconnection', which causes auroral substorms by injecting particles deep into the magnetosphere and releasing the energy stored in the Earth's magnetotail. The Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission, launched on 13 March 2015, improved the spatial and temporal resolution of the Cluster II results by having a tighter constellation of spacecraft. This led to a better understanding of the behavior of the electrical currents in the electron diffusion region. On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms. Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification. Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is the principal investigator for the THEMIS mission, claimed, \\"Our data show clearly and for the first time that magnetic reconnection is the trigger.\\". =Laboratory plasma experiments= Magnetic reconnection has also been observed in numerous laboratory experiments. For example, studies on the LArge Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA have observed and mapped quasi-sepratrix layers near the magnetic reconnection region of a two flux rope system, while experiments on the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have confirmed many aspects of magnetic reconnection, including the Sweet‚ÄìParker model in regimes where the model is applicable. The confinement of plasma in devices such as tokamaks, spherical tokamaks, and reversed field pinches requires the presence of closed magnetic flux surfaces. By changing the magnetic topology, magnetic reconnection degrades confinement by disrupting these closed flux surfaces, allowing the hot central plasma to mix with cooler plasma closer to the wall.

Factors of a good work ethic Proponents of a strong work ethic consider it to be vital for achieving goals, that it gives strength to their orientation and the right mindset. A work ethic is a set of moral principles a person uses in their job. People who possess a strong work ethic embody certain principles that guide their work behaviour; to develop and process a strong work ethic will inevitably result in the production of high-quality work which is consistent. The output motivates them to stay on track. A good work ethic fuels an individual's needs and goals, it is related to the initiative by a person for the objectives. It is considered as a source of self respect, satisfaction, and fulfillment. Factors are: #Goal-oriented actions: It is not about making plans or the next logical steps; it's about getting things done so that the work invested wouldn't be counter-productive. #Prioritized focus: Focusing on qualitative activities that a person is responsible for and in areas where they can make a difference or a high impact based on objectives. #Being available and reliable: Spending time on the work and building oneself up for the task. #Conscientiousness: A desire to do a task well, being vigilant and organized. #Creating a rewarding routine/system: Engaging in tasks that provide strength and energy which can be transferred to your ultimate goals, creating a habit and a habitat for success. #Embracing positivism: Shape a problem with the statement \\"good, (action) (problem)\\", e.g. \\"I'm tired and it is time for a workout\\" leads to \\"Good. Workout tired\\". A negative work ethic is a behavior of a single individual or a group that has led to a systematic lack of productivity, reliability, accountability and a growing sphere of unprofessional/unhealthy relationships (e.g., power politics, lack of social skills, etc.). =Assumptions= Assumptions about good work ethic, drawn out in the philosophical writings of Goldman, are: #The path to what you want is to take action. #The success of action plans depend upon how congruent one's worldview (Weltanschauung) is with the society's. #Many problems faced are only a temporary breakdown of self management. #Setting time limits for achieving goals helps to overcome the edge of discomforts that time can have on subjective needs. #A positive problem-solving or goal attainment experience improves one's ability to cope with the next difficulty. #Hardships in life is a normality, they become a problem when they are the same over and over. #A person is what s/he does, and feelings flow from behavior. #Feelings can be viewed as beliefs about one's wants. #How hard you work will determine how far you go. #In the 1970s, a good work ethic was considered as a lifestyle to meet unmet or unsatisfied wants by people. Capitalist view The Puritans who settled in New England around the 17th and 18th century believed that working hard at one's call was a sign that one would be saved. They were followed by Calvinists who believed in predestination and had faith that they were chosen or had the call from God to fulfill their duty in the world. To both of them, accumulation of wealth was an indicator of working to their fullest capacity as a response to the call and assurance for earning salvation. These ideologies are the foundations of the Protestant work ethic. Max Weber quotes the ethical writings of Benjamin Franklin: > Remember, that time is money. He that can earn ten shillings a day by his > labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends > but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon that the > only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings > besides. Remember, that money is the prolific, generating nature. Money can > beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings > turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it > becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces > every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a > breeding sow, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He > that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores > of pounds.Benjamin Franklin, Advice to a Young Tradesman, Written by an Old > One (1748), Italics in the original Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. It is in effect an ethical response to the natural desire for hedonic reward, a statement of the value of delayed gratification to achieve self-actualization. Franklin claims that Bible readings revealed to him the usefulness of virtue. Indeed, this reflects the then-Christian search for the ethic for living and the struggle to make a living.Weber, Max The Protestant Ethic and \\"The Spirit of Capitalism\\" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells, pp.9-12 Steven Malanga refers to \\"what was once understood as the work ethic‚Äînot just hard work but also a set of accompanying virtues, whose crucial role in the development and sustaining of free markets too few now recall\\". Experimental studies have shown that people with fair work ethic are able to tolerate tedious jobs with equitable monetary rewards and benefits, are highly critical, and have a tendency for workaholism and a negative relation with leisure activity concepts. They valued meritocracy and egalitarianism.Mirels and Garrett (1971). Protestant Work Ethic. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 36, 40‚Äì44. In the 1940s, work ethic was considered very important and nonconformist ideals were dealt autocratically. Suppression of humor in the workplace was one of them. It is recorded that, at the Ford Company, a worker named John Gallo was fired for being \\"caught in the act of smiling\\". Anti- capitalist view Countercultural groups and communities have challenged these values in recent decades. The French Leftist philosopher Andr√© Gorz (1923‚Äì2007) wrote: > \\"The work ethic has become obsolete. It is no longer true that producing > more means working more, or that producing more will lead to a better way of > life.

In the Soviet Union, the regime portrayed work ethic as an ideal to strive for. The recession is a contributing factor that holds back work ethic, because the generation that inherits economic decline lives in an economy that isn‚Äôt ready to receive them. Without work there to do, the ethic that is attached to it fails to generate distinctive value. The negative work ethic and power structures that don‚Äôt value or credit work done or unethically attribute work done as a service or with higher moral ideals have dissolved the ethic presented in the society and turned the focus onto self-centered perks and individualism. Further, urbanization and an emphasis on large-scale businesses has led to eliminating avenues for learning vital concepts about work. Millennials in a research identified what made them unique was consumerist trends like technology use, music/pop culture, liberal/tolerant beliefs, clothes, and individualistic ones like greater intelligence than work, they were not able to distinguish the concept in the traditional understandings of work ethic.

Cryotherapy may be used to treat a variety of tissue lesions. The most prominent use of the term refers to the surgical treatment, specifically known as cryosurgery or cryoablation. Cryosurgery is the application of extremely low temperatures to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue and is used most commonly to treat skin conditions. Cryotherapy is used in an effort to relieve muscle pain, sprains and swelling after soft tissue damage or surgery. It can be a range of treatments from the application of ice packs or immersion in ice baths (generally known as cold therapy), to the use of cold chambers. While cryotherapy is widely used, there is little evidence as to its efficacy that has been replicated or shown in large controlled studies. Its long term side effects have also not been studied.  Cryosurgery  Medical cryotherapy gun Cryosurgery is the application of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue. The application of ultra-cold liquid causes damage to the treated tissue due to intracellular ice formation. The degree of damage depends upon the minimum temperature achieved and the rate of cooling. Cryosurgery is used to treat a number of diseases and disorders, most especially skin conditions like warts, moles, skin tags and solar keratoses. Liquid nitrogen is usually used to freeze the tissues at the cellular level. The procedure is used often as it is relatively easy and quick, can be done in the doctors surgery, and is deemed quite low risk. If a cancerous lesion is suspected then excision rather than cryosurgery may be deemed more appropriate.  Ice pack therapy  Ice pack therapy is a treatment of cold temperatures to an injured area of the body. Though the therapy is extensively used, and it is agreed that it alleviates symptoms, testing has produced conflicting results about its efficacy. An ice pack is placed over an injured area and is intended to absorb heat of a closed traumatic or edematous injury by using conduction to transfer thermal energy. The physiologic effects of cold application include immediate vasoconstriction with reflexive vasodilation, decreased local metabolism and enzymatic activity, and decreased oxygen demand. Cold decreases muscle spindle fiber activity and slows nerve conduction velocity; therefore, it is often used to decrease spasticity and muscle guarding. It is commonly used to alleviate the pain of minor injuries, as well as decrease muscle soreness. The use of ice packs in treatment decreases the blood flow most rapidly at the beginning of the cooling period, this occurs as a result of vasoconstriction, the initial reflex sympathetic activity. Ice is not commonly used prior to rehabilitation or performance because of its known adverse effects to performance such as decreased myotatic reflex and force production, as well as a decrease in balance immediately following ice pack therapy for 20 minutes. However, if ice pack therapy is applied for less than 10 minutes, performance can occur without detrimental effects. If the ice pack is removed at this time, athletes are sent back to training or competition directly with no decrease in performance.  Cold spray anesthetics  In addition to their use in cryosurgery, several types of cold aerosol sprays are used for short-term pain relief. Ordinary spray cans containing tetrafluoroethane, dimethyl ether, or similar substances, are used to numb the skin prior to or possibly in place of local anesthetic injections, and prior to other needles, small incisions, sutures, and so on. Other products containing chloroethane are used to ease sports injuries, similar to ice pack therapy.  Whole body cryotherapy  Cryotherapy patients during preparation of treatment of c. 3 minutes It is unclear if whole body cryotherapy (WBC) has any effect on muscle soreness, or improves recovery, after exercise. There is no evidence that whole body cooling effectively treats Alzheimer‚Äôs, fibromyalgia, migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stress, anxiety, or chronic pain as its proponents claim. This treatment involves exposing individuals to extremely cold dry air (below ‚àí100 ¬∞C) for two to four minutes. To achieve the subzero temperatures required for WBC, two methods are typically used: liquid nitrogen and refrigerated cold air. During these exposures, individuals wear minimal clothing, which usually consists of shorts for males, and shorts and a crop top for females. Gloves, a woollen headband covering the ears, and a nose and mouth mask, in addition to dry shoes and socks, are commonly worn to reduce the risk of cold-related injury. The first WBC chamber was built in Japan in the late 1970s, introduced to Europe in the 1980s, and has been used in the US and Australia in the past decade. =Adverse effects= Reviews of whole body cryotherapy have called for research studies to implement active surveillance of adverse events, which are suspected of being underreported. If the cold temperatures are produced by evaporating liquid nitrogen, there is the risk of inert gas asphyxiation as well as frostbite. =Partial body= Partial body cryotherapy (PBC) devices also exist. If the cold temperatures are produced by evaporating liquid nitrogen, there is the risk of inert gas asphyxiation as well as frostbite.

The population at the 2011 census was 3,647. An electoral ward exists in the same name. Because of the close proximity of the River Severn and the English Stones section of the river bed, Pilning has found itself the ideal place to make both a substantial railway tunnel and motorway bridge. The Severn Tunnel opened in 1885 and the Second Severn Crossing opened in 1996. Landmarks The Plough Inn The village is home to St Peters Primary School and a number of other amenities including a shop, a doctor's surgery, and several pubs such as The King's Arms. The Plough Inn hosts a jazz evening on the first Sunday of every month. Pilning Cricket Club was established in 1883. The parish church of St Peter was completed in 1855 (consecrated 9 August), the principal architect was Thomas Henry Wyatt with H. Crisp.

He was also the last British Commissioner of Weihaiwei. Early life Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, he studied at University of Edinburgh and later Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1898, he entered into colonial service and worked in Hong Kong. After initial service in Hong Kong, Johnston was transferred to the British leased territory at Weihaiwei in 1906 on the coast of the Shandong Peninsula as a District Officer, working with Sir James Haldane Stewart Lockhart. Johnston was a keen traveller, in 1902 exploring Tonkin, Laos and Siam. In 1904 he visited Kiautschou, Jinan and later Korea. In January 1906, he undertook a year-long journey from Peking to Mandalay, publishing an account of his experiences in 1908. Tutor to Puyi, in the Forbidden City In 1919, he was appointed tutor of thirteen-year-old Puyi who still lived inside the Forbidden City in Beijing as a non-sovereign monarch. As the Scottish-born tutor to the Dragon Emperor, Johnston and Isabel Ingram, daughter of an American missionary and the empress's tutor, were the only foreigners in history to be allowed inside the inner court of the Qing Dynasty. Johnston carried high imperial titles and lived in both the Forbidden City and the New Summer Palace. Johnston met the Ming dynasty Imperial descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun and arranged for him to meet Puyi in the Forbidden City. After Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City in 1924, Johnston served as Secretary to the British China Indemnity Commission (1926). In 1927, he was appointed the second civilian Commissioner at Weihaiwei. He ran the territory until it was returned to the Republic of China on 1 October 1930. After China Johnston was appointed Professor of Chinese in the University of London in 1931, a post based at the School of Oriental and African Studies, to which he bequeathed his library in 1935. This library, one of the finest collections of Chinese and East Asian books in the country, consists of over 16,000 volumes. He retained his ties with Puyi, which proved an embarrassment after the former emperor assumed the throne of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Johnston retired in 1937, having acquired the small island of Eilean Righ in Loch Craignish, Scotland, on which he created for himself a Chinese Garden and flew the flag of Manchukuo.Arnold C. Brackman, The Last Emperor. New York: Scribner's, 1975, p. 206 After a short illness, he died in Edinburgh. In his will, he requested that no religious ceremony be conducted. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated. His ashes were scattered on the island of Eilean Righ and surrounding Loch. He never married but was at one stage engaged to the historian Eileen Power, and was close to author Stella Benson. Mrs Elizabeth Sparshott, to whom he was engaged at the time leading up to his death, burned many of his letters and other materials, at Johnston's request. Johnston's book Twilight in the Forbidden City (1934) describes his experiences in Beijing and was used as a source for Bernardo Bertolucci's film dramatization of Puyi's life The Last Emperor. He was portrayed by Peter O'Toole in the film.

The context is that of systemic risk, a topic of particular concern to central banks, financial regulators and the Bank for International Settlements. Most central bankers have had to deal with a large institution going bust, like Barings did in 1995. The main issue with a retail bank is to ensure that depositors are protected, but the regulators' main concern with a merchant bank is to ensure that there isn't a damaging loss of confidence in the banking system, and that all the trades, transactions and derivatives are wound up in an orderly way. If they are not, and all the traders and investors are suddenly forced to meet their obligations or liquidate their positions on the same day, there would be a crisis in the market and many institutions, rather than just the one, would probably go bust or at least suffer substantial losses in a dangerous spiral of falling prices and forced selling. This is the background story to Long-Term Capital Management: there are many published articles on why that particular hedge fund failed, but very few on the systemic risk of all LTCM's counterparties attempting to unwind their positions at once. This is why the Federal Reserve Bank of New York intervened and organised a $3 billion bailout. Worse, at least one major European bank had 'hedged' or laid off risk on a significant percentage of its trading book by derivatives trades with LTCM but was a significant investor in LTCM itself. In other words, they had sold on the risks to LTCM, while buying back into them. Even without such errors, there is the worry that positions we think are hedged (effectively 'insured' against adverse market movements) might lose that protection when the counterparty who sold us those derivatives goes broke. An event which would, by its very nature, occur on the very day the markets go crazy. Nobody knows what would happen if one of the world's largest banks became severely distressed and was forced to suspend trading, except to say that it would be far worse than long-term capital management: firstly, because they have ongoing trades with every significant market player, everywhere; secondly, because the sums of money are so much larger. A bulge- bracket bank will, on any given day, have over a ten trillion dollars of open trades on the foreign exchange markets and in derivatives. Fortunately, there are regulatory measures to limit the risk of failure in a Large and Complex Financial Institution. All banks operate under the Basel Capital Accords, set up by the Bank for International Settlements, and their 'Risk' departments enforce \\"BIS 1\\" and nowadays the \\"BIS 2\\" risk accounting regimes. These are complex sets of rules allowing the bank ‚Äì and its regulators ‚Äì to know how much money is at risk in trading positions, no matter how complex, and how much 'regulatory' capital' must be set aside as a buffer against each trade going sour. Further, there can be no concentration of risk with one counterparty, no matter how large they may be. That last measure ‚Äì the counterparty risk limit ‚Äì is every market player's best protection against the failure of a trading partner. And if that player was the only company hit by their trading partner's bankruptcy, or one of a few dozen players caught in the same position, they would all be safe. But we still don't know what will happen if every market player, everywhere and in every market took the same hit. Which is, of course, the perfect description of 'systemic risk'.

Seven Society at other colleges/universities  There have been several secret societies with \\"seven\\" in their name. No connection between the societies has been shown, but there is at least some tradition in the use of the names. One such secret society is the Seven Society, Order of the Crown and Dagger, known to exist at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. The founding date of the William and Mary society is reported to have been as early as 1826. A second unassociated secret society operates at Longwood University. The society known as Princeps, was founded on 7 principles of leadership. Members are selected during their undergraduate career and are not revealed until graduation by wearing a crimson sash bearing the 7. The group recognizes and honors citizens of the Longwood community who are exceptional leaders. The mysteries of this organization are only revealed with their droppings around campus and their recognition of those who embody the spirit of Princeps. Students often step on the black 7 pointed crowns painted around campus for good luck. A third society was the Mystic Seven Fraternity, constituted in 1885,See University of Illinois fraternity archives at http://www.library.uiuc.edu/archives/uasfa/4102055.pdf of which the Virginia Temple of the Hands and Torch was the parent chapter. Prior to the Civil War, there had been a Mystical Seven Society, with several chapters across the South. One surviving group at Mississippi created a chapter at Virginia. That Virginia chapter later organized the Mystic Seven Fraternity, also calling the new organization Phi Theta Alpha.There is nothing to indicate that the post- Civil War Mystic Seven Fraternity had any real organic connection to the pre- Civil War Mystical Seven. The society's publication, The Mystic Messenger, published articles questioning why the society even had such a distinctive name. Five years later the Mystic Seven Fraternity merged with Beta Theta Pi, with the Virginia chapter becoming the Omicron chapter of Beta Theta Pi. A fourth unrelated society, also called Mystical Seven, was founded in 1907 at the University of Missouri. It is often claimed that this society was directly inspired by the Seven Society at Virginia, (although no citations are given), but it took the older Mystical Seven name. A fifth unrelated society is the Seven Society (The Club) at East Carolina University in Greenville, NC. Established in 1927, the name of the organization was originally the \\"East Carolina Men's Social Club\\" until it was changed to \\"Seven Society\\" in 1962 for reasons unknown. Referred to as simply \\"The Club\\" by most of its members, the sign of this society is the same as that of the Seven Society at the University of Virginia, except that the numbers \\"322\\" appear beneath the \\"7.\\" The numbers 322 are also depicted in the Skull and Bones secret society logo. Notable members include: the screenwriter Kevin Williamson, James Maynard, and Vince MacMahon.

This is an economically active, densely populated area. The population in 2011 was 2,418,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 3.79 km2.Eurostat Due to its commercial nature, the parish is one of the island's primary destinations for tourism, due to the concentration of historical sights and shopping. It contains the localities Caminho do Meio, Courelas, Pasteleiro, Port Pim, Termo da Igreja and Vigia.  History  Image of the Horta Bay, as seen through the eyes of the Earl of Cumberland (16th Century) Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o, at one time a military fortification that protected the ships in Porto Pim harbor The first recorded reference to settlers in the area of Ang√∫stias referred to the (in 1532). Since 1468, the island and parish had been under the administration of Josse van Huerter, a Flemish leader during the early colonization of the island of Faial. The settlement and growth of the village of Orta (later Horta) was concentrated in two nuclei: an interior settlement in the valley of Flamengos and the southwestern religious parish of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias ().In 1498, Horta was elevated to the status of vila (analogous to town), but consistent growth between Monte da Guia and Esplamaca allowed the community's elevation to the status of city, by 1833. Several smaller agglomerations developed within the area of Ang√∫stias. Porto Pim, a sheltered bay between Monte Escuro and Monte da Guia, became a natural refuge for the first colonists, where they could easily load and unload cargo and supplies. Along the southern coast, the area of Pasteleiro, became the site of the first commercial businesses associated with the pastel or woad industry (first started by van Huerter). On the western edge of Horta Bay, the first homes were constructed, around the small chapel of Santa Cruz (where Josse van Huerter and his wife, Beatriz de Macedo, were buried).In her testament, Beatriz (who died in 1531) made a provision for the reconstruction of a Church of Santa Cruz on the same site (which had since been destroyed). In 1567, the Fort of Santa Cruz was built for the defense of the island. Unfortunately, these fortifications, the convents and many of the churches, were sacked by English privateers in 1589 and 1597, and the buildings burned to the ground. By the beginning of the 17th century, several new military/defensive structures were built in order to protect the growing community, including the Military Doors of Porto Pim (), the Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o (), the Fort of Greta (), and the Fort of Nossa Senhora da Guia (). The Chapel of Santa B√°rbara () was later constructed in Ang√∫stias by the Flemish nobleman Pero Pasteleiro and his wife Madelana da Rosa.It too was destroyed by an earthquake in 1850, but reconstructed later at the cost of several workers. Originally completed in 1522, through the initiative of Friar Pedro da Atouguia, the Convent of S√£o Francisco () was originally built on a site called Pedras dos Frades (along the coastal boulevard where a compass rose was constructed in the 20th Century). It was sacked and set ablaze in 1597 by English privateers, later destroyed during a storm, after being re- constructed in 1609. A third convent and church was re-constructed in 1696 on higher ground and farther away from the coast. On November 12, 1700, it was reconsecrated as the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary (). Its principal benefactor, Sim√£o Liuz Carolo, was moved from Angra do Hero√≠smo to a mausoleum in the main chapel on the 4 November 1700. With the end of the religious orders in 1835, the convent was donated to the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia, which installed its hospital and Asilo de Mendicidade. On 4 May 1899, a violent fire completely destroyed the convent: the Church survived. The civil parish of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias was formed on 28 November 1684. Frair Louren√ßo, Bishop of Angra, on 30 August 1675, finally initiated the construction of a church in the name of Santa Cruz. In 1688, after a visit of Bishop Clemente Vieria, the parish received 572$000 r√©is for the construction. It would eventually be constructed in 1800 and receive the name Church of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias: its bell-towers were finished in 1861. Between 1839 and 1969, due to the developments in the telegraph industries, Horta (and Ang√∫stias in particular) was the central node in the trans-Atlantic submarine cable network. The basing of English, American and German telegraph companies in Ang√∫stias resulted in urban and social growth. Many of the buildings constructed during this period have become integral to the landscape of the parish, including the Hotel Faial, the homes and businesses of the Dabney family, the Colonia Alem√£ and several of the original buildings constructed to house the telegraph equipment. By October 20, 1876, the commercial port was constructed; it became an important trans-Atlantic point, as an Allied port during both World Wars, a stopover for hydroplanes crossing the Atlantic and way-point for Dutch Atlantic tugboats. In the early years, the dock came to supplement, then supplant, the harbor of Porto Pim for whaling vessels involved in the North Atlantic whale hunt. A new marina was eventually inaugurated (June 3, 1986) to handle the annual growth in yachts and pleasure craft to the region. Geography =Physical geography= Overlapping mountains: Monte Escuro (foreground) and Monte da Guia (background) as seen from the harbour in Horta This urbanized parish's northern border begins at the Horta Marina, and crosses through commercial buildings to the Ramp do S√£o Francisco and alongside the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia (the Rua da Santa Casa) before intersecting the property-line of the former Dabney residence The Cedars, following the Rua Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, until intersecting at Rua da Ilha do Pico. From this point the border follows Rua Ilha do Pico until Rua do Mo√≠nho, where it skirts Monte Carneiro until reaching the border with Flamengos. The western border follows Cal√ßo da Fugeuira for several metres before extending westerly into the pasturelands of Pasteleiro, where it plunges south through the industrial zone, crossing the Via-R√°pida and the Rua do Lajinho until reaching the sea. The parish encompasses an area that extends from the civil parish of Feteiras along the southern coast of Faial, to the port area of the city of Horta. It includes the bay of Port Pim, Monte da Guia and Monte Escuro, and a small portion of Monte Carneiro. It is fronted on the north by the civil parish of Matriz and Flamengos, while completely surrounded on all other borders by the Atlantic Ocean. The parish is part of the Horta- Flamengos-Feteira geomorphological zone referred to as the Horta Platform localized along the southeast portion of the island, and characterized by a low altitude, smooth relief created from several lava flow covers.Machado, et al. (2008), p.3-4 The area includes many Strombolian cones (including Monte Carneiro), in addition to the Monte da Guia Tuff Surtseyan cone. These volcanic cones are linked together by smoothly planed areas which consist of lava flows with pumice or sedimentary materials.Machado, et al. (2008), p.4 Ecoregions/protected areas Sections of the Nature Park of Faial are included within the boundaries of the civil parish, including: * Nature Reserve of the Caldeirinhas (), totally surrounded by the Monte da Guia landscape, the special nature reserve of Caldeirinhas refers to the internal crater open to the southern ocean at the base of Monte da Guia; * Protected Area for the Management of Resources of the Faial-Pico Channel (), is a protected zone that covers the southwestern corner of Faial and across to Pico, hugging the coast along Angustias, but also the adjacent parishes of Feteira, Matriz, Concei√ß√£o, Praia de Almoxarife, Pedro Miguel and Ribeirinha; * Protected Landscape of Monte da Guia (), this protected landscape comprises most of the southeastern portion of the parish, covering an area of about 73 hectares, that includes the cinder cones Monte Queimado and Monte da Guia, as well as the isthmus that connects the two structures (referred to as Entre- Montes) forming the beach of Porto Pim. Also within the borders of Ang√∫stias is the cinder cone of Monte Carneiro, to the west, along its frontier with the parish of Flamengos. The hilltop is the highest elevation in the parish, with views to the urbanized area of Horta. =Human geography= This is a hilly area that includes several slag/spatter cones (the aforementioned Monte da Guia, Monte Escuro and Monte Carneiro are all extinct cones), as well as rugged coastal areas and public sand beaches (the beach at Porto Pim). The area includes several pasture-lands but is generally urbanized, with an industrial area located in the west along an ancillary branch of the Regional E.R.2-1a motorway, a residential neighbourhood along the southwest coast, and portion of the central city of Horta in the northeast coast. Along with the main Regional E.R.1-1a roadway, which follows the coast from the marina to Feteiras, the Regional E.R.2-2a variant (Estrada Pr√≠ncipe Alberto do M√≥naco- Estrada Regional de Santa B√°rbara) extends from the intersection at the Church of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias northwest to Flamengos, while the expressway (the Via-R√°pida) to Feteiras begins at a traffic circle around the locality of Santa B√°rbara. Many of the important civic, cultural or regional buildings are located in Ang√∫stias, including the islands only secondary school (EBS Escola Secund√°ria Manuel Arriaga), the only hospital () on the island, the headquarters of the police, the commercial marina, dock and container terminal, the principal installations of the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia (the benevolent society that homes the elderly) and the supermarket (Modelo). It also includes historical portions of the village of Orta, including the main commercial and residential buildings that formed the community in the late 19th century. Economy While the western part of the parish is utilized as pasturelands, or for cultivation, the urbanized nature of the eastern part has concentrated on tertiary and municipal services. The Industrial Zone of Santa Barbara between the Via-R√°pida and Rua das Courelas is the main secondary nucleus of industrial activity, in addition to the commercial container and fishing port along the eastern coast of Faial.  Architecture  The front facade of the Fort of Santa Cruz used in the defence of the harbour The Church of Ang√∫stias, site of the first chapel and resting place of the founders of Horta hermitage on the volcanic cone of Monte da Guia Being one of the nuclei of the city of Horta, Ang√∫stias is the home of many buildings important to the history of the region. Some of these have been renovated and reused for other purposes (for example the Fort of Santa Cruz), while others have become important as tourist attractions (for example Peter's Cafe) or continued to be active in the community (such as the Church of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias). =Civic= * Captaincy of the Port of Horta (), part of the security and economic fiscalization of imports/exports, the Art-Deco style building located across from Cais de Santa Cruz is classified a Property of Public Interest; * German Colonial Estate () * Hospital of Horta (), the corporatist structure, which symbolizes the utilitarian manner of its construction was defined on 20 April 1946, but only executed as of 30 April 1946 under the Comiss√£o de Constru√ß√µes Hospitalares (Hospital Construction Commission). * Naval Club of Horta () * Peter Caf√© Sport (and Scrimshaw Museum), a landmark in the world of ocean navigation, the bar, cafe and museum is a historical reference in the Azores for whalers and yachtsmen travelling the Atlantic Ocean; * Porto Pim Whale Factory Museum (), constructed at the height of the whaling industry in the Atlantic, the factory was an initiative of several partners, who hoped to capitalize on the value of whale oil.GRA/OMA (2013), p.1 The factory continued to produce whale oil and process byproducts from the carcasses of cetaceans captured off the coast of the central group. * Prince Albert of Monaco Meteorological Observatory () * Public Library and Regional Archive () * Residence of the Arriaga Family () - remodelled in 2010‚Äì2011, the former childhood family home of the first President of Portugal Manuel Arriaga, the Casa das Florinhas (House of the Small Flowers) was scheduled to open in 2011; * Residence of the Dabney Family The Cedars () * Submarine Cable Houses (), the buildings that house the land-links to the submarine cables providing communication to the islands of the Azores, these three semi-submerged buildings in the ground go un-noticed at the base of Monte Queimado and Monte da Guia; * Summer Residence of the Dabney Family (), the recuperated manor and wine-press buildings, and scenic lookout on the slopes of Monte da Guia, were popular with the Dabney family, the American first-family of the Azores; * Warehouses of Reis & Martins Lda. () - located along Rua Nova, between the bays of Porto Pim and Horta, the old offices/warehouses of Reis & Martins were important in the construction and maintenance of motor launches and whaling boats, reaching its importance around 1946, when it was the most influential supply centre for the whaling industry on Faial. The original founders were Francisco Marcelino dos Reis, Joaquim Martins Amaral J√∫nior and Tomas Alberto Azevedo, who much later became associated with Costa & Martins, Lda. (another important supplier), and worked closely in partnership with the whaling company Companhia Baleeira Faialense, Lda, then the largest whaling company on the island. It was completely purchased by the Lisboete Francisco Marcelino dos Reis in 1940, where for the next 40 years it prospered as the Centro Nevr√°lgico da Balea√ß√£o no Faial, then declining in importance with the fall of whaling in the region, and closing completely in 1981 (even as the last whale was hunted in 1987). The site fell into decay, housing several whaling boats, historical implements, construction materials and artifacts, before being analyzed by the Sea Observatory of the Azores (). =Military= * 16th Century Bombardment Emplacements/Fortifications of Porto Pim (), in phase of classifications this coastal emplacements were part of an elaborate defensive network that followed the coastal edge, and elaborated in the 16th century; * Bartizan of Porto Pim (), part of the coastal defenses that ring the sheltered cove of Porto Pim constructed in the 15th century; * Coastal Artillery Bunker () * Fort of Greta (; alternatively known as the Castle of Greta, Fort of Greta or Fort of Our Lady of the Guide) the remains of this medieval fortification are located on the edge of the cinder cone of Monte da Guia, facing the Faial-Pico Channel; * Fort of Santa Cruz (), a 16th-century fortification located along Rua Vasco da Gama/Estrada Regional E.R.1-1a, in the historic centre of the city, on the edge of Horta Bay. It was constructed as part of coastal defenses to defend the entrance to the harbour and southern access to the Bay from pirate and privateer attacks, along with its sister forts (Fort of Bom Jesus and Fort of Nossa Senhora da Guia). Its utility was called into question with successive defeats and did little more than garrison troops that saw little action after the Liberal Wars. In 1969, the derelict building (in the possession of the municipal authorities at the time) was re- purposed by the Direc√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN) (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments), and officially re- opened by Pousadas de Portugal as a hostel on 23 September 2004 after interior remodelling. * Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o (), this simple fort includes exterior walls and a single-longhouse used to garrison a small contingent.

It plays an integral part in the religious ceremonies of the annual Sea Week Festival (): a procession accompanies the image of the Virgin Mary from the chapel to the beach at Porto Pim, where it is transported by boat and accompanied by a flotilla of ships to the main marina in Horta. From here, a secondary procession accompanies the image to the Church of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias, where another mass is recited for the faithful.

The road constitutes the border between the suburbs of Ultimo (to the north) and Chippendale (to the south). Broadway is also an urban locality. Broadway connects the south end of George Street where it terminates at the junction with Harris and Regent streets, and runs west to the junction of Parramatta Road and City Road at Victoria Park. Broadway and Parramatta Road are part of the Great Western Highway. History ca. 1930 taken from the heights of the Grace Bros. building Broadway is historically important because it is one of the first roads built in the colony of New South Wales, in 1794. It had been called \\"George Street South\\" and then \\"George Street West\\". After being widened in 1906 when the Central railway station was built, George Street west of Railway Square, it became known as \\"The Broadway\\".Widening the streets - City of Sydney website This name was subsequently shortened to just \\"Broadway\\". In the early nineteenth century, travel to Parramatta on Parramatta Road attracted a toll and this was charged from the area now known as Railway Square. The toll gate was subsequently moved to the approximate junction of the present Broadway and Parramatta Road. St Benedict's Church on Parramatta Road (now incorporated into the University of Notre Dame campus) is the oldest consecrated Catholic Church in Australia.L. Mills, Australia's Oldest Consecrated Catholic Church: St Benedict's, Broadway, Chippendale, 2012. It was the parish church of Norman Gilroy, the first Australian to become a cardinal. Broadway was once a major retailing centre, and for 90 years was home to the flagship complex of department store chain Grace Brothers. The complex consisted of two stores on either side of Bay Street. It was visited by Queen Elizabeth II during her 1954 visit to Australia. Retailing on Broadway declined and the store was eventually closed in 1995. Today this site contains the Broadway Shopping Centre on the western side and the UniLodge on Broadway on the eastern side. The southern side of the road was dominated by the Carlton & United brewery. The brewery closed in December 2006 and the site was sold on 29 June 2007. The site has been redeveloped into a mixed use precinct called Central Park, which includes a new public park located just off Broadway of approximately in size, and a new tower called One Central Park designed by Jean Nouvel and featuring \\"vertical gardens\\" by Patrick Blanc. Located opposite the University of Technology Sydney, One Central Park is an apartment complex with a shopping centre called Central located on the lower levels.

Transit Press 1979 Since then it has been the primary entry point into the central business district for State Transit bus services from the Inner West suburbs until 1 July 2018 when the services were taken over by Transit Systems.. Education A number of educational institutions are located on or around Broadway. These include the International Grammar School (IGS), University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), University of Notre Dame, University of Sydney and the Sydney Institute of TAFE. UTS has a particularly strong presence. The UTS Tower is the tallest structure on Broadway and is a Sydney landmark. Designed in the brutalist style, it has been described as one of Sydney's ugliest buildings. An adjacent building on Broadway designed by Denton Corker Marshall was completed in 2014. There are also plans to redesign the podium of the tower.

He was the eldest son of the 20th king Biyu. He died in battle as Baekje's capital in the present-day Seoul region fell to the northern rival kingdom Goguryeo. Reign He attempted to strengthen royal control of the aristocracy, by selecting officials from his own Buyeo clan, at the expense of the powerful Hae and Jin clans. In 469, he ordered a surprise attack in which the city of Cheongmongnyeon (Ï≤≠Î™©Î†π, ÈùëÊú®Â∂∫ ; near modern Kaesong) was retaken from Goguryeo. In 472, he sent an embassy bearing tribute to Northern Wei requesting support against Goguryeo‚Äôs attacks. However, these advances were rebuffed by the Wei court, which tried to avoid war with Goguryeo which had greater military power at the time, while fighting against Southern Dynasties. In the early 470s, according to the Samguk Sagi, King Jangsu of Goguryeo sent a Buddhist monk named Dorim, who was actually a Goguryeo agent. Dorim used Gaero‚Äôs passion for the game of baduk to ingratiate himself, and persuade the king to neglect the country‚Äôs defense in favor of public works. Fall of the capital In 475, Jangsu launched an attack with 30,000 men and overran Baekje‚Äôs defenses in seven days, taking the Han River valley including the capital. Gaero was taken to Acha Mountain Fortress and slain by two men who had defected to Goguryeo from Baekje. Baekje's ally Silla sent an army of 10,000, but arrived too late. He was the last to rule Baekje from its historic heartland in the Han River valley. After his death, Hae Gu, of the suppressed Hae clan, led a bloody revolt.

From this relative, Peromyscus species are distinguished by relatively larger eyes, and also often two-tone coloring, with darker colors over the dorsum (back), and white abdominal and limb hair- coloring. In reference to the coloring, the word Peromyscus comes from Greek words meaning \\"booted mouse\\". They are also accomplished jumpers and runners by comparison to house mice, and their common name of \\"deer mouse\\" (coined in 1833) is in reference to this agility.Deer mouse etymology from Merriam- Webster.

Use as a laboratory animal  While wild populations are sometimes studied, Peromyscus species are also easy to breed and keep in captivity, although they are more energetic and difficult to handle than the relatively more tame M. musculus. For certain studies, They are also favored over the common laboratory mouse (M. musculus) and the laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus). Apart from their importance in studying infectious diseases, Peromyscus species are useful for studying phylogeography, speciation, chromosomes, genetics, ecology, population genetics, conservation and evolution in general. They are also useful for researching repetitive-movement disorders. Their use in aging research is because Peromyscus spp., despite being of similar size to the standard laboratory mouse, have maximum lifespans of 5‚Äì7 years, compared to the 3-year maximum lifespan of ad libitum-fed laboratory strains or wild-caught M. musculus. The Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the University of South Carolina was established by Professor Wallace Dawson in 1985 to raise animals of the peromyscine species for research and educational use. This institute maintains populations of several different species (including Peromyscus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus melanophrys, Peromyscus eremicus, and Peromyscus aztecus). A variety of mutations affecting their behavior, biochemistry, and the color of their coats is exhibited in these genetic lines.

This agricultural community is primarily known for the location of the Central Group's first airport, Horta Airport. The population in 2011 was 1,309,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 23.91 km¬≤.Eurostat It contains the localities Canada da Santa Catarina, Cancela, Cerrado Grande, Farrobim do Norte, Grota do Meio, Jogo, Lombega, Pedreiras, Ribeira Grande and Ribeirinha. History The Church of Santa Catarina, in the junction of several roads in Castelo Branco The first record of the region referred to its old church, dated 30 July 1568; the church became integrated into the diocese in 1643. On 10 July 1514, on the orders of King Manuel I the appropriate religious equipment was installed at this primitive church, which was then composed of three naves, and built over 5 columns. Father Gaspar Frutuoso would later note that the church was one of a succession of churches to be formally built in each of the parishes on the island (following those of Horta, Feteira and Flamengos). Until 1580, a convent existed in the parish, but, owing to the numerous pirate and privateer attacks, the nuns moved their order to Horta, to the Convent of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista. In 1767, the primitive church was replaced by the existing sanctuary to the adoration of Santa Catarina de Alexandria. Diogo das Chagas acknowledges that 1,042 inhabitants in 245 residences lived within the borders of Castelo Branco. The parish was also one of the many parishes depopulated by the 1957 eruption of the Capelinhos volcano, off the coast of Capelo. It contributed to immigration into Europe and North America during the middle of the 20th century, although recently there has been a subtle growth in demographics. In December 2002, Horta Airport, which is located in the parish, was given its international designation. It was original inaugurated on August 24, 1971 by then-President of the Republic, Am√©rico Tom√°s. The first direct flights began on July 5, 1985, between Lisbon and Horta on TAP Air Portugal. Geography The Morro de Castelo Branco, a protected area for marine and migratory birds A view of Castelo Branco looking towards the east, from the Morro Generally, this parish is a zone of pastureland extending from the ocean-front parcels to hillier forests around Cabe√ßo Gordo. The port at Castelo Branco, the old commercial fishing port, has been transformed into a swimming zone. The principal water courses in this region are: Ribeira de Santa Catarina, Ribeira Grande and Ribeira da Lombega The name \\"Castelo Branco\\" was derived from the location of a white rock dike located at the edge of the parish and connected by a thin rock isthmus, like a medieval \\"white castle\\". This Morro de Castelo Branco is a 10,000-year-old rock formation, and a protected area due to the number of bird species that use it as a rookery. The Gruta dos Anelares is located near this area. Economy Agriculture is the principal activity in the parish, due to its fertile soils, producing a wide variety of grains and vegetables (such as wheat, rye, barley and pumpkins). Sugar cane, flax seed, and tea have all contributed to the economy of the parish, even cultivating tobacco until recently. Over the centuries, these activities have also included herding and the dairy industry, as well as ancillary services associated with these activities, including cheese and butter production associated with the islands' base industry. Although local production was common, these industries were subsistence, while high-volume production was handled by the islands' remaining export companies, such as CALF Cooperativa Agr√≠cola dos Lact√≠cinios do Faial and Martins & Rebello. At the beginning of 2012, two local entrepreneurs established the Queijaria O Morro that began to produce a local artesnal fresh cheese. The fishery also adds to the parish's economy, at one time a principal center of whaling and now primarily commercial fishing. It is also common that most involved in these primary industries are also involved in other activities. In addition to a commercial bakery, the industrial zone of Lombega is the center of the aluminum industry. Tourism in the region has grown in importance with the development of the International Airport. Culture Local handicrafts are an important tradition in the region. For example, a collection of miniature wooden agricultural implements created by Ant√≥nio Duarte, are on display by the author in Canada de Santa Catarina. Each piece is a detailed miniature, with a lot of attention to detail. Similarly, other artists, such as Jos√© Rosa who work in tin, the painter Lurdes Andrade or the fine embroidery of Isaura Rodrigues are all examples of the traditional handicrafts produced in this parish. The Sociedade Filarm√≥nica Euterpe de Castelo Branco (a band), founded on April 12, 1912 is the pride of the community, along with its folklore group. In sports, the Futebol Clube de Castelo Branco (founded in 1917) has been active in regional football, challenging other groups in the Horta series. In addition to the parish's feast day in honor of its patron saint (Santa Catarina de Alexandria), falling on November 25, the community also celebrates other religious events. The festival of Saint Peter (in June), which has become an important event in the religious calendar, and Our Lady of Lourdes (on August 15).

The population in 2011 was 486,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 26.64 km¬≤.Eurostat  History  The village was elevated to civil parish in 1600, when it was de- annexed from the neighbouring parish of Praia do Norte. Friar Diogo das Chagas, in 1643, noted that the parish had about 160 inhabitants, and approximately 44 residences. At its largest, the population reached 1,400 inhabitants. The town was practically destroyed in 1672 and 1673 during the volcanic eruption of Cabe√ßo de Fogo (the name of the central volcano on the island of Faial). During this eruption, volcanic ash and pyroclastic projectiles rained down on the community, destroying homes and sterilizing agricultural lands in Capelo and Praia do Norte. Ironically, between 1673 and 1845, Praia do Norte was integrated into the civil parish of Capelo. The Church of the Santissima Trinidade (Church of the Holy Trinity) in Capelo, was ordered constructed by the Captain-major, Jorge Goulart Pimental, to replace the parochial church, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa (Our Lady of Hope), which was destroyed during the 1672 volcanic eruption. A chapel to Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa was later constructed near the old church (which has since disappeared from the landscape). The chapel of Varadouro was founded in 1720, by Father Manuel Pereira Cardoso, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Mount Carmel). Later, in his 1725 last testament, Father Cardoso requested that his inheritors celebrate a mass in perpetuity to the name Nossa Senhora do Carmo, the Holy Sacrament, and Santo Ant√≥nio, on every first Sunday of October. The spa at Varadouro was constructed and inaugurated on 1 August 1954 by architect Read Teixeira.  Geography  Cone alignment along the western flank of Cabe√ßo Gordo stratovolcano in Capelo The Capelinhos volcano, at the western tip of Capelo: the last terrestrial eruption in the Azores occurred in 1957-58 from this cone =Physical geography= Mountainous volcanic craters cover the majority of the parish (being the location of the most recent volcanic eruption in the Azores). The parish has several facets: an area of volcanic craters that extends from the islands caldera, inland pasturelands used to support the agricultural/dairy industry, and a coastal zone of cottages and oceanfront pools. Linking these areas is the ubiquitous Regional Road E.R. 1-1¬™ that connects the communities on the island with Horta in the southeast corner. The parish is located on layers of volcanic materials referred to as the Capelo Volcanic Complex. It is a line of volcanic escoria cones of fissural nature lying on a west-northwest-east-southeast orientation consisting of basaltic volcanism of low explosivity. The peninsula shows varying volcanic shapes and products resulting from surtseyan, Hawaiian and strombolian phases of volcanism. It is area of young rock (less than 10.000 years), overlying the older pyroclasts of the Caldeira Formation, and includes two historical eruptions (the 1672 Cabe√ßo do Fogo and 1957 Capelinhos eruptions). This fractural zone is defined by the Capelo Fault, a fracture system of cones and craters displaying right lateral echelon geometry, which extends to Capelinhos volcano in the western tip of Faial. In this particular area, Capelo Fault is expressed by tens of sub-vertical fractures, concentrated in a 250 meter wide zone, cutting through the pyroclastic sequence of a surtseyan cone exposed in a paleo-sea cliff east of Capelinhos volcano. An example of these fractures can be found on the surface of the Capelinhos volcano; a warm vent on its eastern flank belies the active nature of this volcanism.  Ecoregions/Protected areas  The parish is crossed by several pedestrian hiking trails connecting the volcanic cones along the Capelo Volcanic Complex: Cabe√ßo do Fogo, Cabe√ßo Verde and Cabe√ßo do Canto, as well as interesting geological sites such as Fonte dos Namorados. Capelo is also known for its micro-climate, which has allowed the cultivation of grapes and small wine production. The areas along Canada das Adegas (in Norte Pequeno) and Varadouro are characteristic of these private holdings and \\"adegas\\". In addition, two major protected areas fall within the frontiers of the parish: * √Årea Protegida para a Gest√£o de Habitats ou Esp√©cies dos Capelinhos, Costa Noroeste e Varadouro () - the protected area encompasses many of the extinct cones of Cabe√ßo Verde, Cabe√ßo da Fonte, Caldeir√£o, Cabe√ßo do Canto and Caldeirinhas along the Capelo cape until Cabe√ßo do Goularte, flanking of the central caldera.

This area, primarily identifiable by the barren moonscape and iconic lighthouse were designated for protection and management, and conserves the post-eruption landscape, interdicting reconstruction of homes lost during the event. In addition to the Costa do Nau, the protected area extends to the coast and ocean territory off the coast, surround the base of the volcano; * √Årea Protegida para a Gest√£o de Habitats ou Esp√©cies Varadouro‚ÄìCastelo Branco () - this protected area includes the escarpment face of the southern coast, extending from Varadouro to the Morro de Castelo Branco, which are nesting grounds for migratory and marine bird species; Further, and also included in the Capelinhos-Nordoeste- Varadouro region is the Parque Florestal do Capelo (), a region that extends from the central Capelos cape to the coast between Biscoitos and Varadouro used as leisure/recreative forest park. The Geographer Christophe Neff working since 1999 on environmental changes and vegetation dynamics and plant distribution in the different landscapes of the Capelo area, wrote recently in his blog, - that Capelo has considerably changed in the last twenty years, - more tourism, more secondary houses, and more vineyards are now part of the landscape of Capelo. In the same text he remarked, that in 1999 Capelo was a very fare remote area, the End of the world, ‚ÄúFim do Mundo‚Äù, the same name as a bar, that was situated, in Norte Pequeno in the North of Capelo. =Human geography= In addition to the village of Capelo, at the intersection of the E.R.1-1¬™ and E.R.3-2¬™, the parish includes the localities of Areeiro, Biscoitos, Canto, Cimo da Ribeira, Cruzeiro, Norte Pequeno, Ribeira do Cabo, Rua do Canto, Rua da Igreja and Varadouro. Economy The economy in this region is primarily agriculture-related, with dairy-oriented activities dominating. Meanwhile, owing to the numerous natural monuments in the region (the aforementioned Capelinhos volcano and protected areas), the region regularly sees eco-tourist activities throughout the year, with rural tourism, pedestrian trails and other leisure activities occurring in the areas of Capelo and Varadouro. The parish's southern coast is considered the \\"spa region\\" of the island, dominated by a large bay and the black rock cliffs of Varadouro and the Mouro volcanic plug. Discovered in 1889, the warm waters at Varadouro were considered, at the time, one of the best medicinal treatments in the country for rheumatism and skin diseases; its hypersaline waters whose temperatures average , attracted \\"beachgoers\\" who travelled to the ocean- carved pools for refreshment during the Gilded Age, while partaking of the thermal waters at the spa. Since this period, the use of the thermal waters has been intermittent, during phases of proactive local governments; around the late 20th century the buildings were already in ruins. Plans to economically rejuvenate the area were concentrated on reconstructing the buildings, as a way to attract new visitors. But, in November 2007, these small plans were suspended in order to redevelop the site into a Hotel-Spa facility. These plans stagnated until 2009 when, along with INOVA, the regional government proposed a new project to revitalize the thermal-spa potentiality of the Azores (called TERMAZ), which projected the reconstruction of the existing Varadouro spa buildings: a project that was stalled by 2011. Amid opposition declarations requesting a timeline for their reconstruction, by 2011, the Regional Government indicated their intention to expropriate lands necessary to \\"re-qualify and reactivate\\" the Thermae of Varadouro (and suggesting that only 10% had not been acquired until this point).

This religious celebration is associated with the testamente of Father Cardoso who requested his heirs celebrate a mass in his Chapel of Varadouro in the name of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Carmo). The celebration occurs on the first Sunday in October. =Tourism= Tourism in this parish is associated primarily with the main sites: Capelinhos and Varadouro. The re-qualification of the primary roadways within the past few years has been a process of improving and developing rural, eco- and geo- tourism. Similarly, with the emphasis on improving tourism in the Varadouro region, the natural rock pools have been improved and thermal spa in planning for remodeling.

The population in 2011 was 907,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of .Eurostat The northernmost parish on the island, it is located northwest of Horta and is linked via the Estrada Regional E.R. 1-1¬™ roadway to the rest of the island. The tree-covered hills and pasture-lands cover the interior, and hedged farmlands extend to the Atlantic coastline cliffs, a natural plateau above the sea, that was settled by early Flemish and Spanish colonists in the late part of the 15th century. Primarily an agricultural community, the population is comparable in size to other parishes on the island, though this has decreased by half since the 1950s (when there were approximately 2000 inhabitants). Today, it remains an agricultural centre of the island of Faial, anchored by the Cooperativa Agr√≠cola dos Lact√≠cinios do Faial, one of the primary rural industries on the island, responsible for sales of milk, cheese and butter. History The parochial Church of Santa B√°rbara, as it currently appears in Pra√ßa (the village square) after extensive renovation following the 1971 fire. The history of the settlement of Cedros was tied to the failure of the Flemish nobleman Josse van Huerter's first expedition in 1466 to the island. Abandoned by Huerter, some members of his failed expedition were joined by settlers from Terceira and Spain whom explored and settled along the northern coast of Faial. The origin of the name Cedros comes from the local cedars (the Cedros-das-Ilhas or Cedros-do-Mato) found in the pasture-lands and forests of the area (). In addition to the cedars, along the numerous river-valleys (especially Ribeira Funda, Ribeira Pinheiro and Ribeira Sousa) they encountered species of Pine, Juniper, flowering plants (such as the family Adoxaceae), laurel (), Buckthorn (), and Ginger Lily (), as well as other broad-leaf plants. Close access to potable water allowed the settlers to develop small tracts of land, build homes of ubiquitous volcanic rock and cultivate a subsistence lifestyle: a few animals (cows, lambs or goats) and a small vegetable garden. The introduction of wheat allowed the development of a small local export industry. Between 1466-67, Josse van Huerter returned to the island, through the patronage from the Duke of Burgundy. After a failed settlement on the Lomba dos Frades, he established the nucleus of what would become Horta and beginning the first Captaincy of the island. Some of the more adventurous settlers, primarily from the island of Terceira,Luis Daniel & Natacha Soares (ed.), 2003, p.136 followed the trails north to the area now known as Santa B√°rbara (Pra√ßa). These new settlers were more affluent then the original settlers (some even noblemen), who constructed larger, more ornate homes: such as the Castelo da Rocha Negra (or Casa dos Lacerdas dos Cedros), a three-floor house with molded cornices, verandas, and corbels in black volcanic rock. Father Gaspar Frutuoso, the celebrated Portuguese historian, priest and humanist, best known for his six- part tome Saudades da Terra that documented the genealogy and history of the Azores archipelago, recounted the conflicts, histories and personalities of the region. While, the development of the stain/woad industry and conflict between impresarios Van Huerter and Wilhelm van der Hagen were important events on the island, it was the Fleming Hern Jannequim that created controversies in Cedros. Also known as Arnequim, he caused his own problems by confronting and expelling the Magistrate-of-Justice and then threatening the Captain-General with death, when they prepared to capture him. The conflict was eventually resolved by the King who was bemused by his audacity. Regardless, Flemish influence and importance had slowly begun to decline on the island, and Spanish settlers began to venture to this region. The village was formally founded in 1594: this date is conjecture, based on evidence found during the reconstruction of the parochial Church of Santa B√°rbara following a fire that occurred in November 1971. The church was originally constructed during the Iberian Union, in grand dimensions and in a style different from other churches on Faial (including four bells in the tower). The northern bell was large, and many locals reflected that it could be heard from as far as the base of the island's caldera. A current myth, perpetuated by older residents, involves the disappearance of the bells which, some say, were mysteriously removed and installed at the S√© Cathedral of Angra do Hero√≠smo, Terceira. An anonymous letter was also sent at one time stating that the bells were buried beside the church, although the bells were never found. Another interesting holdover of the Iberian Union was the enormous silver-plated oil lamp that hung within the church (the only other lamp of similar dimensions was hung in Spain). By 1643, Friar Diogo das Chagas claimed the parish was inhabited by 2126 people. In 1672, a violent eruption caused an important exodus to Brasil. Also, the end of the Iberian Union, resulted in the expulsion of most of the Spanish living in the parish (which included Sal√£o at the time). Similarly, an epidemic between 1717 and 1718 caused the deaths of many. Yet, the growth of the Carmelite, Jesuit and Franciscan religious orders at about the same time resulted in the growth of the faith community on Faial. =Legend of the Moorish Crown of Cedros= A legend that dates back to the Philippine Dynasty, recalls the time after the fall of Terceira, when the islands of the Azores were occupied by forces of Philip II of Spain. Even before this time the Azores had always been cursed by pirates and privateers, who would attack by surprise during foggy days, under the cover of night or the light of day. They assaulted, robbed and sacked many of the communities along the coast, sometimes conscripting men to work as slaves. As legend tells, a pirate galleon, commanded by a Moorish King attacked the island of Faial, but since the ship was spotted in time, the local population was given time to prepare. The pirates encountered stiff resistance and were forced to retreat without pillaging the homes along the northern coast. During the course of the retreat, the Moorish King lost his crown (made of silver and adorned with leaf in sparkling metal), after leaving it along a hedge-row while battling the defenders. Along the coast, the King remembered he had left his crown behind, and not wanting to lose his symbol of power, he resolved to return to the island. But, not wanting to be recognized as pirates they returned as local mariners. Not discovering the lost crown where he had left it, the group began to ask around but found no clues to its location. The local people began to get suspicious, and they were obliged to abandon their search and returned to their lands in North Africa, from which they did not return. Meanwhile, the crown was discovered by a woman from Cedros, who, when she heard that they were searching for it, was suspicious that they were pirates and attempted to hide the crown. She wisely raised her skirt, and placed her leg through the ring-like crown, and passed unbeknownst to the pirates. Realizing the value of the object, and not wanting her contemporaries to know what she had hidden, she continued to wear the crown around her leg until it began to swell and hurt. In the end she informed the towns-people, who attempted to extricate the woman from the crown, washing her leg in water and ash soap to loosen it, but without success. In the end, the residents had no alternative but to cut the crown and later re-solder it cautiously. In the end the crown remained in the parish of Cedros and over time it was used in the feasts to the Divine Holy Spirit. With the passing of time and fearful of damaging such a symbolic and rich object, a copy of the crown was created, and the original was hidden away and guarded. As the legend ends, the crown continues to be guarded every year at the home of the mordomo of the Holy Spirit feasts, and that the cuts are still visible around the crown. It is unknown whether any part of the above story is more than legend.√Çngela Furtado-Brum, 1999, p. 255-256 Geography The northern coast of Cedros showing many of the communities and principal agglomerations Cedros is one of the largest parishes on the island of Faial. It is bordered on the east by Sal√£o and west by Praia do Norte and extends from the coast to the center of the island (and the Cabe√ßo Gordo volcano). Apart from the rich pasture-lands and hedged-fields in Alto do Inverno, Alto do Rigo or Cabe√ßa da Vaca, the coastal cliffs are approximately above sea level (the highest coastal altitude in this parish being near Ribeira Funda). The region is intersected by several rivers and valley creeks including Ribeira Funda (the Deep Ravine), Ribeira Pinheiro (Pine Ravine) and Ribeira Sousa (Sousa Ravine, named after one of the original settlers), which are usually dry throughout most of the year. The population is concentrated along the Regional E.R. 1-1a Roadway that circles the island. Pra√ßa (village square) is the more urbanized centre of parish, although most places are identified by the smaller neighbourhoods, or localities (), where settlements developed, including Porto de Eira, Cabe√ßo, Cascalho, Cov√µes and Ribeira Funda. Uphill, a secondary road (linked to the E.R. 1-1¬™ by the Canada da Sousa, Rua de Igreja and Canada do Vale) connects the localities of Canto, Janalves and Miragaia (colloquially known as the Rua de Cima). Each of these places have their own distinctions, and some include their own local pubs, community markets () or religious sanctuaries (there are four imperios (temples to the Holy Spirit) in Cedros. Economy CALF (Cooperativa Agr√≠cola dos Lact√≠cinios do Faial) expanded milk processing facilities, as seen along the E.R. Regional Road The main economy in this area is agriculture. The soil of the parish is fertile allowing the cultivation of various legumes and grains. Wheat, corn, beans, potatoes and sweet potatoes have been agricultural staples in the region over the decades. Dairy production has also had an important role in the economy since this northern coast was populated, but it only became an organized industry in the early 1920s. About this time an enterprising couple (Professor Constantino Magno do Amaral and D. Teresa) began a small factory in the area of Rua da Igreja, eventually occupying the building currently \\"occupied\\" by Ethnographic Museum (Nulceu Etnogr√°fico dos Cedros) across from the main church. Later, a second firm, Castro, Merrinho & Xavier began operating in Cascalho, along Canada do In√™s. Jos√© Freitas also developed a small business in Canto da Gatinha, a group of investors started the Uni√£o dos Lavradores that operated along the regional road, and the Uni√£o Industrial Cedrenses (locally referred to as \\"f√°brica do Marujo\\") was also formed in Pra√ßa (long after Professor Amaral's operation had ceased). By 1941 many of these operations had been bought or failed and the remaining businesses, Castro, Merrinho & Xavier and Uni√£o Industrial, were being squeezed by low milk prices. It was then that a group of enterprising farmers, under the counsel of Professor Jos√© da Rosa Aica, banded together to form what would eventually be known as the cooperative CALF: the Cooperativa Agr√≠cola dos Lact√≠cinios do Faial. The idea of a cooperative spread quickly in the north of the island through the parishes, and it quickly became the largest enterprise on the island. Castro, Merrinho & Xavier was later purchased by a group from Lisbon to form Lacto A√ßoreana, it lasted briefly, eventually coming under the control of a Horta businessman and failing. The Uni√£o Industrial Cedrense was purchased by Martins & Rebello, then the largest milk processor in Portugal, and moved to Cascalho (not too far from the Cooperativo) to occupy the old Castro, Merrinho & Xavier buildings. By 2004, the Cooperative had survived the competition, and restructured its operations to compete in the European market, expanding physically to handle the production. It is the principal business located in Cascalho, and responsible for the production and packaging of cheese and butter under the Ilha Azul label. In Cedros, Martins & Rebello did not survive the century. As part of its customer-driven re-inorientation, the factory once-again reintroduced its store-front cheese shop (abandoned during the late 20th century), and experimented with new variants for restaurants, such as their Moledo table cheese. Tourism has become the second local industry in the region. \\"Rural Tourism\\", highlighted by the Nucleo Etnogr√°fico dos Cedros and several renovated \\"bed and breakfast\\"-like cottages, attract visitors to this northern coast village. The museum once included several examples of antique farm implements, equipment and tools used in daily life, as well as some pictures associated with the village and life in 19th-20th centuries. Currently, the Museum is in disuse, and most of the exhibits have been placed \\"in storage\\". The area is served by several small shops, including bakery and pastry shop, hair-dressers, mechanical shops, car dealerships, restaurants (such as the Esconderijo), and a supermarket (Aldina Supermercado/Restaurante) open in 2012, that serves both the local market of Cascalho and nuclear settlements of Cedros, as well as other parishes surrounding the civil parish. The history of the restaurant O Esconderijo has been described recently by the geographer & blogger Christophe Neff in his blog, in the chapter ¬´ Nick's Hideway ‚Äì O Esconderijo ¬ª in one of his last posts, retrieving 20 years of geographical research in the Island of Faial.

Ten former AVG pilots, after returning to the United States in 1945, formed the Flying Tiger Line established on 24 June 1945 as National Freight Service known under the name of National Skyway Freight using a small fleet of 14 Budd Conestoga freighters purchased as war surplus from the United States Navy.\\"Trucking Anywhere By Air\\", November 1945, Popular Science The pilots and two ground crew provided half of the initial investment, with the balance coming from California oil tycoon Samuel B. Mosher. For the next four years, Flying Tiger Line carried air freight on contract throughout the U.S. and, as the airline expanded, carrying supplies to U.S. troops under Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the occupation of Japan. In 1949, the Civil Aeronautics Board awarded Flying Tiger Line the first commercial air cargo route in the U.S., a transcontinental route from Los Angeles and San Francisco, California to Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly afterward, the company began chartering passenger aircraft for group travel as well; its Lockheed Super Constellation, Douglas DC-4 and DC-6 fleet comprised the largest trans- Atlantic charter operation through the 1950s. Operations During the Korean War, Flying Tiger aircraft were chartered to transport troops and supplies from the United States to Asia; Flying Tigers later received a cargo route award to Japan, China, and Southeast Asia. The airline also played a major role in the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line, flying equipment to remote outposts in northern Canada and Alaska.

Boeing 747-132SF freighter at Chicago O'Hare Airport in 1979 Flying Tiger Line adopted the Canadair CL-44 swing-tail aircraft in 1961, becoming one of the first carriers in the world to offer aerial pallet shipping service. In 1965, Flying Tiger Line began operating jet aircraft when on September, 27, the first (as N322F) of four Boeing 707 was delivered. The Boeing 707 remained in the fleet only few years, and later sold, upon arrival of the higher-payload Douglas DC-8, the largest civilian airliner until the Boeing 747 entered service. The first Douglas DC-8-63F registered as N779FT was delivered to the airline on June 26, 1968 and the other eighteen followed until 1972. In 1974, the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 747. The Flying Tiger Line then put in orders for brand new Boeing 747-200F freighters designated the Boeing 747-249F, which at the time were among the heaviest commercial airplanes flying, weighing in at . These aircraft had the powerful \\"Q\\" (Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7Q) engines and heavy landing gear and could simultaneously carry both of fuel and of cargo loaded through both the nose door and the side door at the same time. Aircraft loaders had earlier refused to work at the extreme height necessary for loading freight on the upper deck, so the \\"supernumerary area\\" or \\"hump\\" was configured with 19 first class seats instead which were used to transport livestock handlers, charter agents and mechanics as well as dead-heading pilots and flight attendants. Tiger's Ad Hoc Charter livestock flights provided airlift for exotic animals. Two examples were thoroughbred racehorses and show animals from Stansted, England to the Melbourne Cup, as well as breeding stock cattle (milk supply) to nations such as Japan and Thailand. They became known for carrying a number of unique cargoes, including Shamu the SeaWorld killer whale and the torch of the Statue of Liberty. By the mid-1980s, Flying Tigers operated scheduled cargo service to six continents and served 58 countries. It surpassed Pan American World Airways in 1980 as the world's largest air cargo carrier after acquiring its rival cargo airline Seaboard World Airlines on 1 October 1980. It also operated military contract services, most notably DC-8 routes between Travis Air Force Base, California and Japan in the 1970s, followed by weekly 747 passenger service between Clark Air Base, Philippines, and St. Louis, Missouri via Japan, Alaska, and Los Angeles during the 1980s. Covert flights for the military were not uncommon throughout the airline's history, given its roots in Civil Air Transport (CAT), as with its sister airline Air America, originally owned by General Claire Lee Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers fighter squadron in Southeast Asia. At its peak, the Tigers employed approximately 251 flight attendants and carried up to a record 594 passengers and crew on its MAC all-coach passenger flights. Approximately 998 pilots worked for the airline based throughout the US. Large crew bases were situated at Los Angeles, New York City and Lockbourne, Ohio (Rickenbacker International Airport). The Los Angeles headquarters operation included its own engine shop and jet maintenance business. Flying Tigers also made livestock carriers for airplanes, some comparable in external size and shape to the standard AMJ container used in the FedEx flight operations. They operated a recording company subsidiary, Happy Tiger Records, from 1969 to 1971. Charter and scheduled passenger operations were flown by their subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, which was formed in January 1981, and ceased operations in 1983, when it was sold to Tower Air.\\"Airlines Remembered\\" by B.I.

In embryonic diapause, the embryonic blastocyst does not immediately implant in the uterus after sexual reproduction has created the zygote, but rather remains in a state of dormancy. Little to no development takes place while the embryo remains unattached to the uterine wall. As a result, the normal gestation period is extended for a species-specific time. While much of the molecular regulation involved in activating dormant blastocysts has been characterized, little is still known about entry into diapause, and the conditions which enable a blastocyst to remain dormant. Some mammals that undergo embryonic diapause include rodents, bears, armadillos, mustelids (e.g. weasels and badgers), and marsupials, (e.g. kangaroos). Some groups only have one species that undergoes embryonic diapause, such as the roe deer in the order Artiodactyla.  Purpose  Mammals may undergo diapause to avoid the risk to their own lives during unfavourable and/or environmental conditions. Mammals use embryonic diapause to time the birth of their offspring for favorable metabolic and/or environmental conditions. Reproduction has a large energy cost and it is beneficial to have ideal conditions (e.g. available food, mild weather, previous offspring weaned) to ensure the offspring survives before giving birth.  Types  Two types of mammalian embryonic diapause have been identified. = Facultative diapause = Facultative diapause is also known as lactational delayed implantation due to its regulation via lactation. If a female copulates while still lactating for a previous litter, the suckling stimulus will cause the embryos to enter into diapause. This is known to occur in some rodents, insectivores and marsupials. =Obligate diapause = Obligate diapause is also known as seasonal delayed implantation and is a mechanism that allows mammals to time the birth of their offspring for favorable environmental conditions. This mechanism occurs as a regular part of the reproductive cycle in mammals such as armadillos, all species of pinniped, many mustelids, all ursids, one species of fruit bat, and the roe deer.

He produced further hits during 1967‚Äì68 by Lester Sterling and Stranger Cole, Derrick Morgan, Slim Smith and The Uniques (\\"My Conversation\\"), Pat Kelly, and The Sensations, establishing him as one of Jamaica's top producers. Between 1969 and 1972 he produced classic hits including Slim Smith's \\"Everybody Needs Love\\", Max Romeo's \\"Wet Dream\\", Delroy Wilson's \\"Better Must Come\\", Eric Donaldson's \\"Cherry Oh Baby\\", and John Holt's \\"Stick By Me\\". Lee was a pioneer of the United Kingdom reggae market, licensing his productions to the Palmer Brothers (Pama) and Trojan Records in the early 1970s. The mid-1970s saw Lee work with his most successful singer, Johnny Clarke, as well as Owen Gray and Cornell Campbell, and along with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, he broke the dominance of Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid. This era also saw the emergence of the \\"flying cymbal\\" sound on Lee's productions, developed by drummer Carlton 'Santa' Davis, with Lee's session band, The Aggrovators (\\"flying symbol\\" technique was started by Winston Grennan who shared it with Davis). Lee was instrumental in producing early dub music, working with his friend and dub pioneer King Tubby in the early 1970s. Lee and Tubby were experimenting with new production techniques which Lee described as \\"implements of sound.\\" Working with equipment that today would be considered primitive and limiting, they produced tracks that consisted of mostly the rhythm parts mixed with distorted or altered versions of a song.\\"Replicant: On Dub\\" by David Toop; Chapter 51, Pages 355‚Äì356. > With all the bass and drum ting now, dem ting just start by accident, a man > sing off key, an when you a reach a dat you drop out everything an leave the > drum, an lick in the bass, an cause a confusion an people like it... Lee encouraged Tubby to mix increasingly wild dubs, sometimes including sound effects such as thunder claps and gunshots. In addition to King Tubby, dub mixers Prince Jammy and Philip Smart also worked extensively on Lee's productions, with most of Lee's dubs from 1976 onwards mixed by Jammy. In addition to dub sides and instrumentals, Lee would be one of the first producers to realise the potential of reusing the same rhythm tracks time and time again with different singers and deejays, partly out of necessity ‚Äì unlike some of the other major producers Lee did not have his own studio and had to make the most of the studio time he paid for. The latter half of the 1970s saw Lee work with some of Jamaica's top new talent, including Linval Thompson, Leroy Smart, and Barry Brown. By 1977 Joe Gibbs and Channel One Studios with the Hookim Brothers became \\"the place to be\\", reducing Lee's prominence. However, during the late 1970s Lee produced almost every deejay, notably Dennis Alcapone, U-Roy, I-Roy, Prince Jazzbo, U Brown, Dr Alimantado, Jah Stitch, Trinity, and Tapper Zukie. Most of these were quick productions, usually to classic Studio One or Treasure Isle riddims. The aim was to get deejay versions on the street quickly and were usually voiced at Tubby's studio in the Waterhouse district of Kingston. In the early 1980s, Lee purchased Gibbs' studio in Duhaney Park, and continued producing, albeit on a less prolific basis than in the 1970s. In 1982 an episode of the Channel 4 documentary series Deep Roots was dedicated to Lee. Filmed in the control room of King Tubby's studio it included a lengthy conversation with him and some of the musicians he has worked with over the years including Delroy Wilson, Johnny Clarke, Prince Jazzbo and Jackie Edwards. It then shows Lee producing a dub while Prince Jammy mixes. The program has been released on DVD in January 2008. In 1983, Lee produced the first album by future star Beenie Man, titled \\"The Invincible Beany Man (The 10 Year Old D.J. Wonder)\\". In 2008 he was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government in recognition of his contribution to Jamaican music.

The population in 2011 was 1,138,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 3.08 km¬≤.Eurostat It is the second smallest parish within the administration of Horta. History The settlement of the area that became known as Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o was first attributed to the Flemish nobleman Joss van Aard (which was later transliterated into Portuguese as Jos√© da Terra, literally Joseph of the Earth/Land), where he made his home, cultivated a small parcel, and planted fruit trees on the edge of Ribeira dos Flamengos (Ravine of the Flemings): :\\"...who settle along a ravine, today named Ribeira da Concei√ß√£o, in virtue of the chapel to this invocation that he constructed...\\"Marcelino de Lima (1981) Along his holdings was a large promontory that overlooked the Bay of Horta, and extended into the Canal that the Flemish colonists referred to as The Needle ('), later to be known in Portuguese as Espalamaca. In 1498, Joss de Utra (the second Captain-donat√°rio of Faial), established his administrative center for the village in the deeper part of the Concei√ß√£o, thus attracting a settlement wave. A decade after this migration, King Sebastian (30 July 1568) referred to several new communities in the eastern coast of Faial: S√£o Salvador (Matriz), with about 100 to 200 homes; Feteira, Castelo Branco, Praia do Norte, Praia do Almoxarife and Flamengos, with less than 100. In this document, the parish of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o was established. Later, friar Diogo das Chagas, a noted historian, in his book Espelho CristalinoDiogo das Chagas (1989) p.478 referred to this parish having 594 inhabitants scattered in 161 buildings. D'Utra, would establish his administration at Rua do Bom Jesus No.16 in Concei√ß√£o, to house his executive, administration and local jail (referred locally as the Casa da C√¢mara e Cadeia), literally the House of the Council and Jail. By 5 November 1632, Fern√£o Gomes Massam, then Corregador dos A√ßores, reported that the building became incapacitated and its roles were transferred to other buildings within the municipality.In 1926, only the walls remained of this building which was destroyed by the 31 August earthquake. Fortifications were constructed in the lower part of the parish during the 17th Century, including the Fort of Alagoa (July 1621) and later the Fort of Bom Jesus (1821), in order to help protect and defend Horta from pirates and privateers that harassed and sacked the communities of the archipelago. Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o was actually the second village in the Horta basin, after Matriz do Sant√≠ssimo Salvador: the parish of Nossa Senhora das Ang√∫stias established only in 1684. The historian Gaspar Frutuoso, noted that the Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o (Church of Our Lady of the Conception) was constructed with three naves, and five columns on each side, and chapel located on its eastern quarter. In 1589, it was sacked by English privateers. In October 1597, it was once again pillaged, but then set aflame. Frair Diogo de Chagas noted that it was rebuilt, starting in 1607, becoming the ‚Äúmost perfect that existed before\\". It was once again remodelled in 1749, under the direction of Father Teod√≥sio Ferreira de Melo. In 1701, the Hermitage of Pilar () was built by Father Filipe Furtado de Mendon√ßa, along the edge of the parish (along Espalamaca), where he was eventually buried. In 1729 it was destroyed during a fire. Also, across from the Casais do Farrobo, as noted by Gaspar Frutuoso, a chapel for Santo Amaro () was constructed as promised by Braz Pereira Sarmento. In 1858 the Forte do Bom Jesus, having been almost completely abandoned except for a canon, was requalified in order to house the new jail. In 1868, a road was finally opened to the chapel of Santo Amaro in Flamengos. It was in the late part of the 19th century that Manuel In√°cio de Souza Sarmento, a rich politician in the municipal council of Horta constructed the Palacete of Pilar alongside the Hermitage of Pilar, which would be centre of society until it was divided between his ancestors a century later. The residence was ransacked by his descendants, sold off and occupied by the family of the Viscount Leite-Perry, losing much of its cultural importance. The planting of the first submarine cable on Alagoa Beach, initiated the Era das Companhias dos Cabos (Era of the Cable Companies), on 23 August 1893. The Palacete do Bar√£o da Ribeirinha (Palacette of the Baron of Ribeirinha), the home of Vitoriano da Rosa Martins, then situated in the Largo da Igreja Paroquial, functioned provisionally as the Liceu da Horta (Lyceum of Horta), an educational school for members of the upper-classes. The 1926 Horta earthquake caused the inhabitants to become displaced or homeless on 31 August. The grand local church did not escape the tremors, and was irreparably destroyed: it was reconstructed in 1933, in a modest Art Deco-style. Similarly, by the end of the 20th century, the Palacete of Pilar, now completely abandoned, caught fire and was engulfed. For many years, Father Am√©rico's project, the Casa do Gaiato, operated a home for abandoned or orphaned children in Concei√ß√£o. Inaugurated on 28 September 1969, it helped to transition many children into the society of Horta; for 30 years it provided aid and care to these children, under the tutelage of Father Raul de Jesus. Geography The Ribeira da Concei√ß√£o dividing the parish from the city of Horta The forest of Vitorino Nem√©sio Park, showing a Dragueira Concei√ß√£o, along with the parishes of Matriz and Ang√∫stias, makes up the northern limit of the city of Horta. Topographically it is divided into two parts: an agricultural area, divided by an escarpment that extends from the S√≠tio of Volta to the western border with Flamengos, and a more urbanized area along the coast and Ribeira da Concei√ß√£o, which is directly connected to the rest of Horta. The border extends across Espalamaca towards the Caminho Velho (Old Road) before cutting across the eastern extend of the Flamengos valley towards the Quinta do S√£o Louren√ßo, cutting across a minor volcanic cone, before ending at the base of Monte Carneiro. The southern limit of the parish extends from the Estrada Regional E.R.2-2 towards the centre of the city of Horta, through the locality of Santo Amaro, before winding down the Ribeira da Concei√ß√£o starting around the middle of the s√≠tio of Volta to the Atlantic Ocean. From the Travessa do Mirante da Concei√ß√£o, on the southern margin extends towards the municipal courthouse and traffic circle along the Avenida Marginal. Gaspar Frutuoso, referred to the ravine in these terms: \\"...in days of strong showers, the water strength and quantity of water overflow, difficulting the crossing [of] the center of the village\\". Even Frutuoso knew of the importance of this river, as he elaborated that the waters were used for mills along the waters edge, and requiring the bridge to cross between the two settlement agglomerations. Once called the Foz da Ribeira, later the Praia da Alagoa or Praia da Concei√ß√£o (Beach of Concei√ß√£o), is one of the few natural sand beaches on the island, and along with the Vitorino Nem√©sio Park () is part of a recreational area in the shadow of Espalamaca. Economy The main industries in this area are primarily associated with the forest industry (sawmills and carpentry) and civil construction, as well as many commercial businesses located along the coast. In the area of Santo Amaro, the economy is more closely associated with dairy and agriculture. During the 19th Century, the barrio of Santo Amaro, was known for its bakers that produced bread and pastries for the city of Horta. During the 20th Century the activities were diversified to include many businesses: restaurants, snack-bars, cafes, mini- markets, gymnasiums, clothing shops, designers and publishers, music, stationary stores, furniture shops, jewellery, natural supplement shops, financial services, travel agencies, exporters and spas.

He composed more than 800 works including operas, symphonies, chamber music, a concerto, and pieces for band, orchestra, organ, and piano. He is best known for his church music. Biography Memorial to Healey Willan Willan was born in England on 12 October 1880 and began musical training at age eight, with studies at St. Saviour's Choir School in Eastbourne.Healey Willan at St. Martins Chamber Choir . Stmartinschamberchoir.org. Retrieved 26 August 2011. He continued at St. Saviour's until 1895, when he began working as organist and choirmaster at several London-area churches. He earned, by examination in organ playing, harmony, counterpoint, history and orchestration, the ARCO in 1897 and fellowship in 1899. From 1903 to 1913, he was organist and choirmaster of St. John the Baptist Church on Holland Road in London. The Anglo-Catholic Tractarian movement had led to an Anglican revival of plainsong, and in 1910 Willan joined the London Gregorian Association (which strove to preserve and revive \\"plain-chant\\"). In 1913 Willan emigrated to Canada.Healey Willan at Naxos.com. Retrieved 26 August 2011. Willan became organist-choirmaster of Toronto's largest church, St. Paul's, Bloor Street, whose rector, Canon Cody, was later to become Ontario provincial education minister and the chancellor of the University of Toronto. In 1914, Willan was appointed a lecturer and examiner in music at the university. His royalties as a church music composer allowed him to leave \\"low church\\" St. Paul's in 1921 and to become precentor of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene (Toronto). He remained there until his death. St. Mary Magdalene's, under Willan, became a North American mecca for choral and Anglican church musicians. In 1934 he founded the Tudor Singers, which he conducted until it disbanded in 1939.St. Martins Chamber Choir Church of St. Mary Magdalene In 1920 the Toronto Conservatory (since 1947 the Royal Conservatory of Music) appointed Willan as head of its theory department. Later he became vice-principal. The conservatory was part of the University of Toronto. Students from the conservatory could become eligible to complete the music degree examinations administered by the university. From 1937 to 1950, Willan was University of Toronto Professor of Music and Organist and responsible for the music degree examinations. His notable pupils included pianist Howard Brown, tenor Gordon Wry, and composers Cecil Gray, Patricia Blomfield Holt, Walter MacNutt, F. R. C. Clarke, Phyllis Gummer and Kenneth Peacock. When the Order of Canada was established in 1967, it named Willan a Companion. In Britain, it was customary for the Archbishop of Canterbury to occasionally grant very distinguished English cathedral musicians the Lambeth Doctorate, Mus. D Cantuar; in 1956 Willan, \\"the Dean of Canadian composers\\"naxos.com became the first non-English church musician to be so honoured; subsequently, many Canadian universities followed suit. Willan was one of the first Canadian musicians to appear on a Canadian postage stamp. It was not lost on young Canadian musicians that Willan was able to make his livelihood as a composer, and that being a composer was something to which they might realistically aspire. Willian died on 16 February 1968 in Toronto. Compositions While serving as the organist and choirmaster at St. Paul's, Bloor Street, Willan became interested in the music of another Anglican parish, that of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene. St. Paul's was an evangelical, low church; St. Mary Magdalene's, while much smaller, was notably high church or Anglo-Catholic. By 1920, Willan was assisting with choir practice. In 1921, he resigned his post at St. Paul's and turned his attention to St. Mary Magdalene's. He set about creating a great many liturgical works for use in the church's services and on creating one of the few choirs in North America with expertise in singing unaccompanied music to a very high standard. He remained at St. Mary Magdalene's until shortly before his death, last directing the choir in 1967. Willan composed some 800 musical pieces, the majority sacred works for choir such as anthems, hymns and mass settings. His non-sacred opus includes some 50 choral works, 100 song arrangements for voice with piano accompaniment, many works for piano solo, for voice with instrumental accompaniment, two symphonies, a piano concerto, chamber works, incidental music for stage works, ballad operas, and at least one important opera (Deirdre). His Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue was inspired by the Max Reger piece of the same name. In 1953, Willan received a commission to write an anthem for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The resulting anthem, O Lord Our Governour, continues to be frequently performed. Willan's friends clubbed together to pay for his fare to London, so that he could attend the ceremony in person. Willan is best known for his sacred choral and organ works, which show evidence of his love for plainsong and Renaissance music. For example, many of his liturgical compositions employ western church modes from a thousand years ago and the modality and harmony of late nineteenth-century Russian Orthodox choral music. His vocal lines are significantly more melismatic, his style more contrapuntal and rhythmically much freer than was the case in the liturgical music of his contemporaries. The lively acoustics at Saint Mary Magdalene allowed the melismatic lines to soar and yet linger at the same time. His larger choral works, however, were very Romantic in nature. His rich harmonic palette and luxuriant, soaring melodies stand as testament to his admiration of both Brahms and Wagner. :His music represents a unique and beautiful combination of styles: both an homage to the sacred music of five centuries ago and a reflection of the innovations of the Romantic/post-Romantic period in which he lived.''Tribute to Willan'' . St. Martins Chamber Choir website, Retrieved 26 August 2011. Personal People who remembered Willan from his time at St Mary Magdalene's liked to moderate his somewhat dour and pious public image by quoting him ‚Äì it was a mainstay of concert talks by Robert Hunter Bell ‚Äì as to his provenance: \\"English by birth; Canadian by adoption; Irish by extraction; Scotch by absorption.\\" Healey Willan Park Healey Willan Park is a local public park named in his honour, situated immediately to the east of The Church of St. Mary Magdalene, on the site of the former convent of the Sisters of the Church, which had relocated first to Oakville and later to Burlington. The small rectangular park is separated from the streets by a low metal fence, which provides safety for the children using the playground and wading pool. Works The Giles Bryant Healey Willan Catalogue assigns numbers to (some of) Willan's works, eg B314, Rise up, my love, my fair one. *Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue for Organ in E flat minor (1916) *Passcaglia and Fugue *Epilogue *Andante, Fugue and Chorale for Organ in C sharp minor (1965) = Choral works =  Missae breves  * Missa brevis No. 1 in E flat * Missa brevis No. 2 in F minor * Missa brevis No. 3 in F major * Missa brevis No. 4 in E major (1934), based on the plainsong hymn, Corde natus ex parentis * Missa brevis No. 5 in F sharp minor (1935) * Missa brevis No. 6 in F minor (1935) * Missa brevis No. 7, \\"O Westron Wynde\\" (1936), based on the English folk melody of the same name * Missa brevis No. 8 in D minor, \\"Missa SS Philippi et Jacobi\\" (1949) * Missa brevis No. 9 in A minor, \\"Missa Sancti Michaelis\\" (1947) * Missa brevis No. 10 in C minor/major (1948) * Missa brevis No. 11 in G minor/major, \\"Missa Sancti Johannis Baptistae\\" (1953) * Missa brevis No. 12 in D major (1956), based on the Christmas plainsong hymn, Christe Redemptor omnium * Missa brevis No. 13 in G minor, \\"Holy Cross\\" (1960) * Missa brevis No. 14, \\"St Alphege\\" (1962)  Motets  * How They So Softly Rest (1917) * Hail, Gladdening Light (1924) * O How Glorious (1924) * Very Bread, Good Shepherd Tend Us (1924) * O Sacred Feast (1924) * O How Sweet (1924) * Let Us Worship (1924) * O Trinity, Most Blessed Light (1925) * The Three Kings (1928) * Preserve Us O Lord (1928) * O King All Glorious (1928) * I Beheld Her (1928) * Fair in Face (1928) * Rise Up, My Love (1929) * O King of Glory (1929) * Lo, in the Time Appointed (1929) * O King to Whom All Things Do Live (1931) * Behold the Tabernacle of God (1933) * Hodie, Christus natus est (1935) * Who Is She That Ascendeth (1937) * O Saving Victim, SSA (1935) * Look Down, O Lord, SSA (1935) * Ave verum corpus (1943) * Br√©beuf and His Brethren (1948) * I Will Lay Me down in Peace (1949) * Christ Our Passover (1950) * Grant Us Thy Light (1950) * The Spirit of the Lord (1950) * Gloria Deo per immensa saecula (1950) * Great Is the Lord (1952) =Operas= *L'Ordre du bon temps (1928) *Prince Charlie and Flora (1929) *The Ayrshire Ploughman (?) *Maureen [lost] *Indian Christmas Play [lost] *Transit through Fire (1942, written for Canadian Radio) *Deirdre (1946, written for Canadian Radio, revised for stage in 1965) = Orchestral works = * Symphonic Poem (1908) * Symphony No 1 in D minor (1936) * Piano Concerto in C minor (1944) * Symphony No 2 in C minor (1948) * Overture to an Unwritten Comedy (1951) * Poem (for string orchestra) (1959) * El√©gie H√©ro√Øque (for band) (1960) =Recordings= *In the Heavenly Kingdom: Elora Festival Singers; Noel Edison, conducting; Matthew Larkin, organ; Joseph Schnurr, tenor.
