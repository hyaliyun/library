This person was a contemporary of the author Cao Xueqin who knew the author intimately enough to be regarded as the chief commentator of his work while it was still unpublished. Most early hand-copied manuscripts of the novel contain red or black-inked commentaries by a few unknown commentators, considered authoritative enough to be transcribed by scribes into subsequent generations of copies. Zhiyanzhai was the most prominent of these commentators. Early copies of Dream were known as ËÑÇÁ°ØÈΩãÈáçË©ïÁü≥È†≠Ë®ò (\\"Zhiyanzhai's Re-Annotations to The Story of the Stone\\"). These versions are known as ËÑÇÊú¨, or \\"Rouge Versions\\", in Chinese. They are the manuscripts with the highest textual reliability. Zhiyanzhai had clearly finished reading Cao's completed draft to reveal details which would otherwise be lost to later generations. It was mostly through Zhiyanzhai's comments that scholars learn (even if fragmentarily) about some passages and incidents in the now missing original ending. Zhiyanzhai also conclusively identified the work as Cao Xueqin's. Orthodox Redologists rely extensively on Zhiyanzhai's notes for research and scholarly conjectures, although the identity of Zhiyanzhai remains a mystery. Redology scholar Zhou Ruchang speculated that Zhiyanzhai was a woman, the second wife and cousin of Cao Xueqin and the person on whom the character Shi Xiangyun was based.http://news.xinhuanet.com/book/2009-03/02/content_10925184.htmSee also Zhou Ruchang(2009). Between Noble and Humble: Cao Xueqin and the Dream of the Red Chamber, ed. by Ronald R Gray and Mark S Ferrara, trans. by Liangmei Bao and Kyongsok Park, Peter Lang Publishing Inc., New York. This hypothesis has not been universally accepted and Zhiyanzhai's identity continues to be shrouded in mystery.

The ship was built as a trawler by Collingwood Shipbuilding Company at Collingwood, Ontario, Canada, and launched in 1918 as Seville. The ship served briefly in the Royal Canadian Navy during the last months of World War I, before being laid up and sold to a British company. In 1928, she was sold to Sydney-based fishing company and operated in Australian waters until she was requisitioned by the RAN in mid-1940 for use as an auxiliary minesweeper during World War II. Durraween operated in the Bass Strait as part of Minesweeping Group 54, and was responsible for clearing mines laid by German merchant raiders, and then later operated around the Torres Strait. She was returned to civilian service after paying off in late 1945, and was broken up in 1952. Construction and design After being ordered in 1917, the ship was built as a trawler by Kingston Shipbuilding Company, at Kingston, Ontario and launched in 1918. After launch, she was completed by the Collingwood Shipbuilding Company at Collingwood, Ontario, and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 31 August 1918. Displacing 271 gross tonnage, she was long, had a beam of and a depth of . In RAN service, the ship was fitted with one 12-pounder gun, one 20mm Oerlikon cannon, and four .303-inch Vickers machine guns for self defence. She was capable of a top speed of 9 knots. Operational history After being commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy, Seville served until 14 January 1919, when she was paid off and laid up. In 1921, the vessel was brought to the United Kingdom at Admiralty expense by the Rose Street Foundry & Engineering Company for laying up at Inverness prior to being sold. The ship remained laid up until 1926, when she was sold to Boston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Company of Grimsby, and registered under the name Seville at Fleetwood. In 1928, she was sold to Red Funnel Trawler Limited of Sydney, New South Wales, and re-registered as Durraween. After being purchased by Red Funnell, Durraween was sailed from Fleetwood, England to Sydney, Australia. The voyage took 92 days, during which the trawler spent some time aground at Cocos Islands, and finished in late 1928. On 28 December 1937, the trawler collided with the passenger liner off Montague Island. On 29 July 1940, Durraween was requisitioned by the RAN for use as an auxiliary minesweeper.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 213. During the war, Durraween was based in Port Melbourne, Victoria as part of Minesweeping Group 54, and operated in Bass Strait. Together with HMAS Orara, they swept for mines off Wilsons Promontory in November 1940 and removed forty-three mines from Bass Strait, which had been laid by the German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin and auxiliary minelayer Passat. In August 1944, Durraween was employed conducting survey work in the Torres Strait. After the war, she was paid off from RAN service on 1 November 1945, and after being returned to her owners in 1946, she worked again as a trawler. She was stripped and broken up at Blackwattle Bay in 1952.

In a music career spanned seven decades, he was regarded as one of the best contemporary four-string banjo players. He performed regularly across the U.S. and in Japan, where he was known professionally as \\"Japan's Harry Reser\\". A 2003 inductee into the National Four-String Banjo Hall of Fame,, Hall of Fame members list, retrieved August 8, 2010 Tagawa often performed as the headline act at banjo jazz festivals and shows. He was also the international goodwill ambassador for the Peninsula Banjo Band. Tagawa was a protege of Reser's, who advised and encouraged him in the development of his single-string technique. In honor of his mentor, Tagawa regularly played Reser's original compositions, including \\"The Cat and the Dog\\", \\"Cracker Jack\\" and \\"Lolly Pops\\". Early career Born in Tokyo, Japan, Tagawa was introduced to the banjo in 1956, when he was twenty-one, by Takashi Tsunoda, one of Japan's top banjoists and recording artists. Although he started on guitar, he found his calling after picking up a four-string tenor banjo. Shortly thereafter, he purchased a used tenor banjo for $20.00. After graduating from Senshu University with a degree in economics, he became a student of Tsunoda's. He was an apt student and quickly developed a style of his own.Atkinson, Glenn: Charlie Tagawa & his Junior Banjo Band, LP jacket notes The Stars & Stripes Are Forever. 1977. After three months of lessons and practicing, Tagawa became a professional banjoist. Tagawa joined a country- western band in Tokyo and played lead banjo on a two-year tour. He then played as a soloist with the Dixieland Dukes for three years. Tokyo's Gaslight Club was his next stop as a featured entertainer, as his repertoire began to include favorite songs of other nations. Performing at restaurants In 1964, the owner of the Sakura Gardens restaurant in Mountain View, California, was in Tokyo for the summer Olympics and caught Tagawa's act. He was so impressed by Tagawa's playing and stage presence that he offered him a contract to play at his restaurant in the U.S. After moving to the US, Tagawa adopted the Western name Charlie, and quickly established friendships with other four-string banjoist in the area. He performed at Sakura Gardens, and its successor restaurant Imperial Gardens, for fifteen years. Tagawa developed a loyal following. On many evenings, his banjo- or washtub bass- (\\"gut bucket\\") playing friends dropped in to listen and jam. Tagawa also performed at other venues, including a stint at San Francisco's Red Garter, a 1920s-themed nightclub with continuous entertainment. Cupertino Banjo Band In 1966, Tagawa met local banjo teacher Chuck Ray, who invited him to join the Cupertino Banjo Band. Tagawa soon became the band's music director, and continued to lead the band for all but one year. Under his leadership and reputation, the band grew at a steady pace. Its name was later changed to the Golden Gate Banjo Band; then in 1971, it became known as the Peninsula Banjo Band (to acknowledge that its members traveled from as far as Santa Cruz and Burlingame). Tagawa had hundreds of banjo students, with whom he used a modified form of the Suzuki method. Many of his students, including Bill Lowrey, Kevin McCabe and Scotty Plummer, went onto successful music careers. Junior Banjo Band Charlie Tagawa in the 1980s In the early '70s, several of Tagawa's younger students formed a band to extend their banjo skills. Ranging in age from six to sixteen, their instruments included banjo, guitar, piano, and washtub basses. Tagawa led the band through the mid-'80s. When they were eventually asked to perform in public, they chose to be called Charlie Tagawa's Junior Banjo Band. The band performed on television shows, at venues such as Marriott's Great America, county fairs, and at charitable organizations' functions and clubs. In 1975, they played at the Fretted Instrument Guild of America's annual convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Their greatest performance was at Tokyo's Banjo Jubilee festival. The band performed in public from 1972 until its last performance at the Peninsula Banjo Band's annual Banjo Jubilee in 1985. In 1977, the band recorded their album The Stars & Stripes Are Forever. Several of the band's members became professional musicians, including Bill Lowrey, Kevin McCabe, Scott Hartford, Bruce Jolly, Pat Dutrow and Nori Tagawa.

He was further acknowledged as the 2001 Jubilee Honoree for his contributions to the Peninsula Banjo Band. In May, 2003, Tagawa was inducted into the Four String Banjo Hall of Fame at the American Banjo Museum in Guthrie, Oklahoma, for his achievements in music education. Personal life Tagawa was married to Masako Tagawa, a piano player and teacher; she died from cancer in the mid-1990s. They had two sons, Nori and Leon, each of whom is an accomplished musician. Nori and Charlie Tagawa often appeared together at jazz festivals and banjo shows. Both sons were original members of Tagawa's junior band. Leon performed until the band's last public appearance in 1985. After his retirement, Tagawa enjoyed an active life as a traveling musician, band leader and grandfather. He died on July 30, 2017.

Initially it was built as a convent for Servite monks in the 15th century, and maintained a religious destination until the end of the 18th century. Following Napoleonic suppressions the convent was turned into barracks and, in 1812, the production of small arms was started. Many kinds of small arms in use by the Regio Esercito were overhauled in the Brescia Arsenal, including the Vetterli rifle and the Carcano rifle in its many versions. Built-in assembly lines produced thousands of the latter, including the entire lot of the M91 TS (Special Troops) Carbine, made between 1898 and 1919. Ammunition was also produced. On 2 March 1945 the military facility was targeted by a massive USAAF air raid that wrought damage all over the city.

Edern ap Nudd (;Geoffrey of Monmouth. History of the Kings of Britain. Old Roman de Brut and Erec and Enide or ') was a knight of the Round Table in Arthur's court in early Arthurian tradition. As the son of Nudd (the Nu, Nut or Nuc of Old French, Arthurian romance ), he is the brother of Gwyn, Creiddylad, and Owain ap Nudd. In French romances, he is sometimes made the king of a separate realm. As St Edern, he has two churches dedicated to him in Wales. Etymology The Welsh name Edern comes from a Brittonic borrowing of Latin Aeternus, meaning \\"eternal, everlasting, immortal\\". Appearances In Culhwch ac Olwen, Edern is named as one of Arthur's knights in a list of his retinue, but plays no part in the narrative. Edern also appears in The Dream of Rhonabwy (a late medieval Welsh Arthurian romance) in which he commands a \\"pure black troop\\" of Danish soldiers allied to Arthur against the Saxons. He is named one of Arthur's foremost counsellors during the battle. =Geraint son of Erbin= Edern plays a more important role in Geraint son of Erbin (a Welsh adaptation of Chr√©tien de Troyes' romance Erec et Enide), in which he and two companions, a beautiful lady and a whip- brandishing dwarf, come across Gwenhwyfar, one of her handmaidens and the knight Geraint ab Erbin in a forest. The handmaiden is sent to discover Edern's identity, but is rebuked and struck by the dwarf. Geraint also goes and suffers the same fate, but chooses to spare the dwarf's life and retreats. Seeking his adversary, Geraint heads to a \\"walled town\\", where a great tournament is annually held. Edern, champion of the tournament for two years running, challenges Geraint to joust. Initially, Edern has the upper hand but by the end of the duel, he suffers vicious wounds at Geraint's hand and begs for mercy. Geraint allows Edern to keep his life on the condition that he rides to Arthur's court to make amends for his insult. Edern accepts the condition, and reveals his name to his rival. Edern later rides to Arthur's court where his apology is accepted by Gwenhwyfar. Heavily injured, he is treated by Morgan Tud, the chief physician of the court. Upon his recovery, he is chosen to accompany Geraint to the kingdom of Geraint's father, Erbin. =Appearances as Yder= King \\"Ydier's\\" attributed arms Outside Welsh- language writing, Edern is first seen in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae as Hiderus filius Nu, a knight of King Arthur's who fought in his Gallic campaign. The poet Wace, in his adaptation of the Historia Regum Britanniae called the Roman de Brut, renders the name as Yder fils Nu(t). There is also an Anglo-Norman Romanz du reis Yder. However, Yder's \\"fame was too small to inspire later writers or visual artists. The only time he may have been immortalised is on the famous archivolt (1120-40) at Modena, which shows a knight called Idernus in a scene with King Arthur (Artus de Bretania), the captive queen Guinloie or Guenevere (Winlogee) and possibly Durmart (Burmaltus).\\"Willem P.

It is well known, with many fossils having been collected from the Oligocene Chadron and Brule Formations in South Dakota. The species was first named in 1904, but was originally classified as a crocodile in the genus Crocodilus. It was reassigned to the genus Alligator in 1918 on the basis of more complete material. It is the earliest known member of the genus Alligator. Taxonomy The skull of Alligator prenasalis (AMNH 4994) =Junior synonyms= Several species of extinct alligatorines have been considered junior synonyms of A. prenasalis. These include Caimanoidea visheri, named by paleontologist Maurice Mehl in 1916 from fragmentary material, and Allognathosuchus riggsi, named in 1931 from a single piece of a lower jaw. Both were considered synonymous with the species in 1972 by paleontologist D.W. Higgins. Mehl used two alternate spellings of Caimanoidea in his 1916 paper: Caimanoideus and Caimanoeda. Because the name Caimanoidea is used first and most frequently, it has been considered the valid name of the genus. =Cladistics= A. prenasalis is similar to the Eocene alligatorine Allognathosuchus mooki. In 1930, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson considered A. prenasalis (then called Caimanoidea) to be ancestral to A. mooki because it appeared to be similar but less specialized. A. mooki was considered to be more specialized because it had a blunt snout, while A. prenasalis had a broader, flat, and supposedly primitive snout. If A. prenasalis were an ancestor of A. mooki, it would have to have occurred in the Eocene. Simpson hypothesized that A. prenasalis appeared at this time and gave rise to A. mooki, which soon became extinct. While A. prenasalis (a more generalized form) possibly could have descended from A. mooki (a more specialized form) through what is known as a reversal, the accepted knowledge at the time was that generalists could not arise from specialists. This was called the \\"law of the unspecialized\\", first devised by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1896. More recent phylogenetic analyses have shown flat-snouted alligatorines to form a clade within a larger group of blunt-snouted alligatorines. Therefore, blunt-snouted forms did not form a single, specialized group, but rather a collection of basal taxa, some of which were ancestral to modern forms such as Alligator. Alligator is usually recovered as a monophyletic group with A. prenasalis as the most basal member of the clade.

She was the niece and lover of Grigory Potyomkin, and the favored lady-in-waiting of Catherine the Great. Alongside her sisters, she was given a favored position at the Russian Imperial court during the reign of Catherine, where they were described as \\"Almost Grand Duchesses\\", the jewels of the court and honorary members of the Imperial family. Biography She was the daughter of Vasily von Engelhardt and his spouse Yelena Marfa Potyomkin, and thus the niece of Grigory Potyomkin. She was introduced to the Russian court with her five sisters (and her brother) in 1775. They were initially uneducated and ignorant, but was soon given a sophisticated polish and made to be the most favored women at the Russian court; they were treated almost as if they were a part of the Imperial family, and were to be known as : \\"almost Grand Duchesses\\" and as the \\"jewels\\" and ornaments of the Russian court. Potemkin gave them large dowries and had Catherine appoint them ladies-in-waiting. They were alleged to be the lovers of their uncle, which was one of the most known gossip subjects and scandals of the age. Her relationship with Potemkin took place in 1777-1779 and ended after her marriage to prince Sergey Golitsyn in 1779. It was possibly ended on her initiative, after she had fallen in love with Golitsyn. It is possible that her firstborn was fathered by her uncle. Her grandmother, Darja Potemkina, is known to have protested to her son against their affair. After their affair ended, her uncle Potemkin had an affair with her sister, Aleksandra. She is described as a beautiful, charming and temperamental blonde.

Biography She made her first appearance on the stage in November 1843, at the Worcester Theatre, as Lady Townley in The Provoked Husband. Her family had opposed her desire to become an actress; she had no introduction, teacher, or patron, but was altogether self-instructed. She was very favourably received by the public. She fulfilled an engagement at Glasgow, and, playing Desdemona to the Othello of Macready, secured the good opinion and the friendship of that tragedian. At his instance, after she had played with success at Dublin and Edinburgh, she was engaged by Mr. Phelps, and made her first appearance at Sadler's Wells, then under his management, in August 1846, as Lady Mabel in the Patrician's Daughter of Westland Marston. She remained at Sadler's Wells three seasons, representing Juliet, Portia, Isabella in Measure for Measure, Imogen, Miranda, and Lady Macbeth; she appeared as Panthea upon the revival of Beaumont and Fletcher's comedy of A King and no King; and she was the first representative of Margaret Randolph and Lilian Saville in the poetic tragedies of Feudal Times and John Saville of Haysted by the Rev.

In 1849 she was playing at the Haymarket with Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean, and in 1850 she accepted an engagement at Drury Lane under Mr. Anderson's management, representing the characters of Mrs. Haller in the Stranger, Mrs. Beverley in the Gamester, Bianca in Fazio, and Leonora in an English version of Schiller's Fiesco.

The Transit Elevated Bus (TEB) () was a proposed new bus concept where a guided bus straddles above road traffic, giving it the alternative names such as straddling bus, straddle bus, land airbus, or tunnel bus by international media. A trial was scheduled to begin in Beijing's Mentougou District by late 2010.3D Express Coach to be put into trial in Beijing CNTV.news, August 25, 2010 However the project was not given authorisation by the district authorities because the technology was considered to be too immature, and further trials were subject to the development of a concept to prove the system actually works. The city of Manaus, Brazil, has also evaluated the option of installing a straddle bus in its city streets. At the time of the 2016 unveiling of the scale model, it was reported that a prototype would be deployed by mid 2016 in Qinhuangdao. Four other Chinese cities, Nanyang, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Zhoukou, had also signed contracts for pilot projects involving the construction of test tracks beginning in 2016. However a test of a prototype design was scrapped in June 2017 over concerns about its viability. In July 2017, 32 people involved into the project were detained by Chinese authorities on suspicion of investment fraud. The prototype bus was removed from the test track in early July. History The idea of Transit Elevated Bus was proposed in 1969 by two American architects, Craig Hodgetts and Lester Walker, as a public transport concept called the \\"Bos-Wash Landliner\\". Later, another version was designed by Shenzhen Hashi Future Parking Equipment Company (Ê∑±Âú≥ËèØ‰∏ñÊú™‰æÜÊ≥äËªäË®≠ÂÇôÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏), and the concept, known as 3D Express Bus (Á´ã‰ΩìÂø´Â∑¥) at the time, was unveiled at the 13th Beijing International High-tech Expo in May 2010. A working scale model was showcased at the 2016 Beijing International High-Tech Expo. Description In China there are four main modes of public transportation: subway, light rail, bus rapid transit (BRT), and normal buses. The express coach would be a substitute for BRT and augment its advantages. To modify the road for the bus, two options are available: rails can be laid on the edges of the lanes that the bus occupies, or two white lines can be painted on the road to facilitate use of autopilot technology. Rails would offer less wheel rolling resistance and better energy efficiency. For either option, it may be necessary to widen the lanes occupied by the bus to accommodate the bus wheels and undercarriage whilst allowing other vehicles to pass under the bus two abreast. Since the bus is no higher than a tractor-trailer, roadway overpasses will usually not be a problem. The bus would run along a fixed route, its passenger compartment spanning the width of two traffic lanes. Its undercarriage rides along the edges of the two lanes it straddles and the overall height is . Vehicles lower than high will be able to pass underneath the bus, reducing the number of traffic jams caused by ordinary buses loading and unloading at bus stops. Passengers on board the bus are expected to experience a ride comparable to riding in the upper level of a double decker bus. They will board and alight at stations at the side of the road with platforms at the bus floor height similar to stations of an elevated railway, or via stairs descending through the roof of the bus from a station similar to a pedestrian overpass. The bus will be electrically powered using overhead lines or other roof electrical contact systems designed for it, supplemented with photovoltaic panels, batteries, or supercapacitors on board. It will travel at up to . Different versions will carry up to passengers, with the larger versions being articulated to facilitate going around curves. A working scale model of the now called Transit Explore Bus (TEB) was showcased at the 2016 Beijing International High-Tech Expo. The bus would have alarms to warn cars traveling too close to it, and signals to warn other vehicles when it is about to turn. It would have inflatable evacuation slides similar to those of an aircraft. Optional features could include sensors to keep it from colliding with a person or object (such as an overheight vehicle in front), warning lights and safety curtains at the rear to keep drivers of overheight vehicles from going underneath, repeater traffic signals underneath to relay the indications of traffic signals up ahead, and animated light displays to simulate stationary objects to prevent disorientation of drivers underneath. According to the 2010 proposal, it would cost about 500 million yuan (~ million) to build the bus with a guideway. This is claimed to be at 10% of the cost of building an equivalent subway, and is estimated to reduce traffic congestion by 20‚Äì30%. The Chairman of the company has said that it would only take a year for one to be built. At the 2016 unveiling of the Transit Explore Bus (TEB) scale model, Mr. Song claimed each bus will cost about 30 million renminbi, or about , now estimated at one-sixteenth the price of a subway train. According to China‚Äôs Xinhua News Agency, the bus can carry 300 people. Proposed and actual trials The cities of Shijiazhuang, in Hebei Province, and Wuhu, in Anhui Province, had applied to obtain financing. A total of of track was set for construction in the Mentougou District of Beijing for late 2010. The trial run was cancelled due to doubts about the project. The city of Manaus, Brazil signed a letter of intent with the Chinese developers to create a straddling bus system. At the time of the 2016 unveiling of the scale model, it was reported that a prototype would be deployed by mid-2016 in Qinhuangdao, a coastal city about east of Beijing. Song Youzhou, the designer of the bus, said in an interview that other four Chinese cities, Nanyang, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Zhoukou, have also signed contracts with his company for pilot projects involving the construction of hundreds of kilometres of tracks beginning in 2016. The inaugural test of such a bus was carried out on a track in the city of Qinhuangdao, Hebei in August 2016, using the Transit Explore Bus 1 (TEB-1) model which was long, wide and high, with a capacity of 300 passengers. In August 2016, China's state media People's Daily Online labelled the tested Transit Elevated Bus a complete scam after Qinghuangdao government officials said that they were unaware of the test. On 9 December 2016, it was reported after the unveiling in August, investors withdrew, and the TEB \\"has been left in a rusted-out barn ‚Äî in the middle of a major road\\". Recognition The Straddling Bus was selected by Time magazine as one of the \\"50 Best Inventions of the Year 2010\\". Criticism and controversies Critics of the project when the concept was unveiled in 2010 have questioned whether the hovering bus could interact safely with other vehicles, particularly when drivers manoeuvre to change lanes. Critics had also argued that the tracks would require relatively straight roads not found in many older urban areas, and that the overhead boarding stations that the bus needed would take up too much space. According to Song Youzhou, the project‚Äôs chief engineer, guardrails would be constructed between the bus tracks and the car lanes that pass through the elevated bus to prevent traffic accidents. The rails would be able to absorb at least 70% of a collision‚Äôs impact to reduce damage to the bus and other vehicles. Lanes for the elevated bus would be limited to passenger vehicles no higher than , and the buses are designed to meet zoning and bridge height regulations in each city. He also said that the buses were fully capable of turning corners, though the cars underneath must wait until the buses have passed before turning themselves. In 2016 Mr. Song said to Chinese media that he had arranged to have Shanghai Jiao Tong University‚Äôs Institute of Automotive Engineering to assess the feasibility of the TEB design. However, the institute‚Äôs director denied that he had any involvement with Mr. Song. The institute‚Äôs vice director and two professors said in the same report that they had conducted a design analysis, but that it was a personal initiative. Based on their assessment, the professors said, the design was ‚Äúbasically feasible‚Äù but ‚Äúnot perfect.‚Äù Southwest Jiaotong University also denied the involvement of technical research and development. \\"It is true that two researchers from Laboratory of Traction Power had a feasibility meeting with the company\\", the deputy director of the lab Wang Kaiyun said, \\"but the comment on it was 'suspicious' (ÊÇ¨).\\"Ë•øÂçó‰∫§Â§ßÂê¶ËÆ§Á≥ªÂ∑¥ÈìÅÂêà‰Ωú‰ºô‰º¥ÔºöËØÑÂÆ°Êó∂Â∞±ËßâÂæóÊÇ¨ (Chinese) 5 Aug, 2016, retrieved on 5 Aug, 2016. In July 2017 the track was demolished after Qinghuangdao refused to extend the TEB developer‚Äôs land contract which was scheduled to expire in July. In July the bus was removed and police arrested 32 individuals for ‚Äúillegally raising funds to finance the TEB‚Äù after complaints from 72 investors were filed with them.

The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Shannon, Dania Ramirez, and Jamie Chung. It follows a bicycle messenger chased around New York City by a corrupt police officer who wants an envelope the messenger has. It was released on August 24, 2012 by Columbia Pictures. Plot The film has a nonlinear narrative. It contains numerous flash-forward and flashback cuts, indicated with an overlaid digital clock showing the time advancing rapidly forward/backward to the next scene. In chronological order: Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a disenchanted Columbia Law School graduate who has put off taking the bar exam because he could not bear to enter the humdrum life of the legal profession. He finds meaning and purpose in being employed as a thrill-seeking New York City bicycle messenger despite arguments with his girlfriend and fellow bike messenger, Vanessa (Dania Ramirez), who insists that he should make something of himself. Vanessa's roommate, Nima (Jamie Chung), has asked Vanessa to move out for a personal reason she doesn't disclose. Vanessa is in the process of packing her few belongings. Nima delivers $50,000 that she has saved for two years to Mr. Leung (Henry O), a Chinese hawaladar, in exchange for a ticket that she must deliver to Sister Chen, buying a place for Nima's son and mother in one of Sister Chen's ships on which gangs smuggle people from China to the United States. Mr. Lin, a local loan shark, has learned of the ticket and that whoever returns it to Mr. Leung can collect Nima's money. He approaches Robert \\"Bobby\\" Monday (Michael Shannon), a gambling-addicted NYPD detective who owes him money, offering to clear Monday's debt if Monday gets him the ticket. Monday begins searching for Nima, who decides to hire Wilee to deliver the envelope with the ticket to Sister Chen by 7 pm after Nima is told by Leung that anyone who knew she was visiting him is a loose end which could cause her to be in possible danger if she tries to deliver the ticket herself. Wilee and Nima conduct their transaction at the college where Nima is a student. After Wilee leaves, Nima is confronted by Monday, who sees the courier receipt Wilee gave her. He is able to steal the receipt from Nima. After Monday leaves, Vanessa finds Nima, and learns the contents of the envelope. Monday catches up with Wilee before he leaves the college campus, stating that he is a college official, that Nima had no authority to handle the contents of the envelope on the college's behalf, and that he would like the envelope back, with the receipt Wilee gave to Nima in his hands. Wilee refuses. He is able to escape, with Monday in pursuit. Wilee heads to the police station to report Monday, only to find out he's a police detective. Wilee hides in the bathroom, where he opens the envelope and finds the ticket. After he escapes the station, Wilee angrily tells his dispatcher, Raj (Aasif Mandvi), that he is returning the package so that someone else can drop it off. Returning to Nima's college, Wilee leaves the envelope, which is picked up by his rival, Manny (Wol√© Parks). Before Manny picks it up, however, Monday calls the dispatch to redirect the delivery to a different address. As he is about to leave the college after returning the envelope, Wilee runs into Nima. He confronts her about the ticket, and she reveals the truth. Guilt-ridden, Wilee tries to catch up to Manny, who refuses to give Wilee his drop. They race each other and in the process, are chased by a bike cop who had earlier tried to arrest Wilee. As they approach Monday's location, the bike cop tackles Manny off his bike and arrests him. Vanessa, who learns of Monday's trickery and races over to warn Manny, appears, grabs Manny's bag and gives it to Wilee. As they are about to escape, Wilee is hit by an oncoming taxi. He falls to the ground fracturing some ribs in the process. He is put in an ambulance with Monday, while his damaged bike is taken to an impound lot, with the envelope hidden in the handlebars. Monday tortures Wilee by pressing on his injured ribs, and Wilee offers to give Monday the envelope in exchange for his bike. Wilee tells Monday that the envelope is in Manny's bag, and Monday leaves to search it, while Wilee meets with Vanessa in the impound lot. She gives him the envelope, which she had retrieved, and he escapes on a stolen bike. Monday, realizing Wilee has tricked him, pursues Wilee to Sister Chen's place. Meanwhile, Nima calls Mr. Leung for help. He deploys his enforcer, the Sudoku Man, to help her. As Wilee reaches Chinatown, he is confronted by Monday, who is threatening to kill him. However, Vanessa arrives with a flash mob of messengers, dispatched by Raj, who delay Monday by hitting him numerous times, giving Wilee time to deliver the ticket to Sister Chen just before the stroke of 7 pm. She calls the captain of her ship and tells him to allow Nima's family aboard. Outside, Monday is confronted by the Sudoku Man, who shoots Monday in the back of his head with a silenced pistol. Dying and feeling faint, Monday tries to get in his car but dies before he can do so. Nima's mother calls her and confirms that she and Nima's son have gotten on the ship. Nima meets with Wilee and Vanessa while they are finally reunited. Cast Production Writer director David Koepp developed Premium Rush and co-wrote the screenplay with John Kamps. They aimed to have elaborate chase sequences like in a William Friedkin film. Film crew preparing to shoot a scene at the intersection of 5th Avenue and West 34th Street (beneath the Empire State Building) Principal photography began in mid-July 2010 and ended by early September 2010 in New York City. Gordon-Levitt was injured during filming on August 1, 2010, when he rode into the back of a taxi. The impact sent Gordon- Levitt flying into the rear windshield of the taxi, slashing his arm which required 31 stitches. A shot of the aftermath of that accident is included as a scene during the credits of the film. Locations included Columbia University, Central Park and Canal Street. Lawsuit In 2011, a lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California by author Joe Quirk, claiming Premium Rush was based on his 1998 novel The Ultimate Rush. The suit claimed many plot, character name, and scene similarities to Quirk's original novel. In July 2012, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg declined to dismiss Quirk's claim that Sony Pictures, parent company of Columbia Pictures, had breached an implied contract. The production company Pariah, director David Koepp and co- screenwriter John Kamps are also named in the suit. On April 2, 2013, Judge Seeborg dismissed this case, finding that the two works were not substantially similar.Gardner, Eriq, \\"Sony Pictures Wins 'Premium Rush' Theft Lawsuit\\", The Hollywood Reporter, April 3, 2013 Reception =Box office= In its opening weekend, Premium Rush opened at #8, grossing $6 million.

The result of a merger between clubs in a tiny municipality, it was still a mainstay in the Third Division between 1995 and 2010. Organization and history It was founded on 6 November 1987 as a merger between Breivikbotn IL and the football section of Hasvik IL. It recruits mainly from the villages Hasvik and Breivikbotn. With only 934 inhabitants, Hasvik was the smallest municipality in Norway to have a Third Division football team. The club colors are red and white, and the club motto is \\"Unity Gives Strength\\" (). The men's football team has experienced three runs in the Third Division, the fourth tier of Norwegian football. Its longest run began in 2004. The team finished seventh in 2004, ninth in 2005, sixth in 2006, fourth in 2007, fifth in 2008 and third in 2009. Before that they played the 2002 and 2003 seasons in the Fourth Division, and in the Third Division from 1995 to 2001. Following the 2010 season the team was relegated again, and languished for three seasons in the lower leagues before reappearing in 2014. Relegated after one season, in 2015 S√∏r√∏y Glimt finished fourth in the Fourth Division. The best known player on the team is Aslak Salkjelsvik, who joined S√∏r√∏y Glimt in 2007. In the 1990s he played second-tier football for Harstad IL. In 2004 the club was rocked by a doping case. People in the club suspected that some of the men's team players indulged in unorganized doping. The club sent a tip to Anti-Doping Norway, and controllers arrived on 9 September. Three players were found to have positive doping tests. The three players admitted the substance abuse. Doping case in Northern Norwegian football are very rare; according to an interview in Nordlys this was probably the first.

Biography He was born at Chard, Somerset, in 1626. His father intended to put him into business, but, discovering that his heart was set upon being a preacher of the gospel, he sent him to Oxford. He was entered of Wadham College, of which he became ultimately a fellow. He had for tutor the afterwards famous Bishop Wilkins. When Adkins 'first appeared in the pulpit at St. Mary's, Oxford, being but young and looking younger than he was, from the smallness of his stature, the hearers despised him, expecting nothing worth hearing from \\"such a boy,\\" as they called him. But his discourse soon turned their contempt into admiration.. Cromwell appointed him one of his chaplains. But, like Richard Baxter, he found the place unsuitable 'by reason of the insolency of the sectaries.' He resettled at Theydon as the successor of John Feriby and the predecessor of Francis Chandler and his ministry here extended from 1652‚Äì3 to 1657. His health having given way, he removed to Exeter, at the instance of Thomas Ford, then minister of Exeter Cathedral. Here he first preached in the parish church of St. Sidwell, while the choir of the cathedral was being prepared for him. When the alterations were completed, the choir, commonly known as East Peter's Church, was capable of accommodating a vast congregation.. He was regarded as one of the best preachers in the west of England at the time. He was ejected from St. Peter's under the act of 1660, but was immediately chosen to St. John's in the same city, which was then vacant. When the Act of Uniformity came, he was for a second time ejected from St. John's. In his farewell sermon, preached 17 August 1662, he spoke thus memorably: \\"Let him never be accounted a sound christian that doth not fear God and honour the king. I beg that you would not suffer our nonconformity, for which we patiently bear the loss of our places, to be an act of unpeaceableness and disloyalty. We will do anything for his majesty but sin. We will hazard anything for him but our souls. We hope we could die for him, only we dare not be damned for him. We make no question, however we may be accounted of here, we shall be found loyal and obedient subjects at our appearance before God's tribunal.\\" He remained in Exeter after his ejection and died there on 28 March 1685, aged 59. His funeral sermon was preached by George Trosse and published in his The Sin and Danger of Popery, in six sermons (1712) and his Farewell Sermon at St. John's (1715).

Producing units are primarily in the Lower Pliocene Pico Sands. Rather than being one continuous oil reservoir, the oil is trapped in a series of narrow stratigraphic traps, with the more porous, oil-bearing sections of the sandstone interbedded with impermeable units, rather like a long layer cake slightly warped up along its long axis. Oil has pooled at the top of the anticlinal fold for each unit.DOGGR, p. 644 A fault underneath this large interbedded sand unit has allowed the formation of yet another producing formation, called the Subthrust Pico; in this unit oil has pooled up against the fault, which has positioned impermeable units on top of porous, oil-bearing sand strata turned on their side.

History, operations, and production The three platforms of the Carpinteria field, as seen from the shore north of La Conchita. From left to right they are Platforms Hogan, Houchin, and Henry. The Carpinteria offshore field was discovered in 1964 by geologists from Chevron and ARCO following the Rincon anticlinal trend, which implied the existence of oil reserves offshore. Production had already peaked at many onshore fields, and technology for drilling and producing offshore was just becoming available. The first part of the field to be found was within the state tidelands zone, and Standard Oil Company installed platforms Hope and Heidi in 1965 to produce from the field out to the tidelands limit.

Signal Petroleum, a subsidiary of the current owner (Carone Petroleum), took over operation of platforms Houchin and Hogan in 1990, becoming the first independent oil and gas operator offshore on the west coast; at this time, the other offshore platforms were still operated by the majors (primarily Union, Exxon, Texaco, Chevron, and Phillips). In addition to the platforms, the company acquired the oil and gas processing plant at La Conchita, on the mountain side of the U.S. Highway 101 freeway where it runs along the sea. Platform Henry, in federal lease OCS-P 0240, has a more convoluted history. The federal government awarded the lease to Sunray DX on April 1, 1968, but their successor (Sun Oil Co.) did not install Platform Henry until August 31, 1979. The platform passed over to Unocal in 1990, and then to Torch Energy in 1996. Torch sold to Nuevo Energy in 1997, and when Plains Exploration & Production acquired Nuevo in 2004 the platform became one of several operated by Plains. Plains sold their operations on the field to DCOR on March 22, 2005.MMS Lease operatorship book for the Pacific OCS region Chevron Corp., the successor to Standard Oil, ran the two platforms in the State leases, ceasing operations in 1992 due to the decline in oil prices and in reservoir productivity. They shut in the wells, and then formally abandoned them and removed both platforms in 1996. Believing that the state portion of the field could be made economical again, and that reserves were not completely depleted, in June 2001 Carone Petroleum proposed to reopen that part of the field by directionally drilling from platform Hogan, which is in federal waters.Scoping Document for Carone's proposal to redevelop the State Portion of the Carpinteria Field As of 2010 that has not occurred. At the end of 2008, there were 44 producing wells remaining on the Carpinteria offshore field distributed between the three platforms, and they reported a water cut of 82%, indicating a mature field in decline (of all the fluid pumped from the field, 82% was water).DOGGR 2008, p. 108 See also *Offshore oil and gas in California References Category:Oil fields in Santa Barbara County, California Category:Geography of Santa Barbara County, California Category:Carpinteria, California ","title":"Carpinteria Offshore Oil Field"},{"id":"28297795","text":"William Addy, engraving by John Sturt from a painting by Samuel Barker William Addy (fl. 1685) was a writing-master based in London, and the author of a system of shorthand published in 1685.

History alt= Toward the end of the 19th century, an aborted attempt was made by J. A. Gamble, the conservator of forests for Madras Presidency, to establish a forest museum in the province. A few years later in 1902, Gamble's successor as Conservator of Forests Horace Arichibald Gass succeeded in establishing a museum for forestry. It was opened to the public 15 April 1902 by Baron Ampthill, the then Governor of Madras, at that point simply referred to as the Forest Museum at Coimbatore. When Gass, the first curator, retired in 1905, his successor F. A. Lodge renamed the museum in his honor. It was expanded in 1905 and 1915. In 1912, the Madras Forestry College (currently the Tamil Nadu Forest Academy) was established in the museum grounds to train foresters. During 1942-47, the museum was closed and the buildings used as shelters for World War II evacuees from Malta and Greece. After Indian Independence in 1947, the museum came under the administration Government of Tamil Nadu. It is currently run by the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding (IFGTB), which is situated in the same campus.

He was in Paris in 1745 and by 1750 he was in England, where he stayed for some years. He painted an equestrian portrait of George III of England when he was Prince of Wales; an engraving after it, by Bernard Baron, was published in 1755.

A portrait of Caroline D'Arcy, 4th Marchioness of Lothian in the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland, previously attributed to Allan Ramsay is now thought to be by Adolph; the collection suggests that it may have been painted when she was living at Blickling, Norfolk, in around 1750. During his years in England Adolph is said to have worked mostly as a portrait painter, but on his return to Austria he was employed in the decoration of interiors, adorning walls with frescoes, and painting the ceilings of large saloons.

Named graphs are a simple extension of the RDF data modelhttp://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-syntax/ \\"Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification\\" through which graphs can be created but the model lacks an effective means of distinguishing between them once published on the Web at large.  Named graphs and HTTP  One conceptualization of the Web is as a graph of document nodes identified with URIs and connected by hyperlink arcs which are expressed within the HTML documents. By doing an HTTP GET on a URI (usually via a Web browser), a somehow-related document may be retrieved. This \\"follow your nose\\" approach also applies to RDF documents on the Web in the form of Linked Data, where typically an RDF syntax is used to express data as a series of statements, and URIs within the RDF point to other resources. This Web of data has been described by Tim Berners-Lee as the \\"Giant Global Graph\\".Giant Global Graph Describing a named graph Named graphs are a formalization of the intuitive idea that the contents of an RDF document (a graph) on the Web can be considered to be named by the URI of the document. This considerably simplifies techniques for managing chains of provenance for pieces of data and enabling fine-grained access control to the source data. Additionally, trust can be managed through the publisher applying a digital signature to the data in the named graph. (Support for these facilities was originally intended to come from RDF reification, however that approach proved problematic.Reification of RDF and N3)  Named graphs and RDF stores  While named graphs may appear on the Web as simple linked documents (i.e. Linked Data), they are also very useful for managing sets of RDF data within an RDF store. In particular, the scope of a SPARQL query may be limited to a specific set of named graphs. = Example = Assume the following (Turtle) RDF document has been placed in a SPARQL-capable store with the name '. @prefix foaf: . a foaf:Person . foaf:homepage . foaf:mbox . foaf:name \\"Joe Lambda\\" . This data has been written in a more verbose form than necessary to show the triple structures The homepage of the person with the email address ' can be obtained using the SPARQL query: PREFIX foaf: SELECT ?homepage FROM NAMED WHERE { GRAPH ?g { ?person foaf:homepage ?homepage . ?person foaf:mbox . } } The FROM NAMED here identifies the target graph for the query. = Named graphs and quads = Prior to the publication of the papers describing named graphs, there was considerable discussion about fulfilling their role within a store by using an arity above that of RDF triple statements: where triples have the form , quads would have a form along the lines of . Named graphs can be represented this way, as , with the advantage that the part will be a URI, giving the quad Web-global scope compared to arbitrary local statement names. This way of representing quads resp. quad-statements was incorporated in the specification of N-Quads.https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/  Formal definition  A paper from the WWW 2005 conference by Carroll et al. includes a formal definition of named graphs.  Specifications  There is currently no specification for named graphs in themselves beyond that described in Carroll et al.

Career  Aggas was apprenticed to Humphrey Toy, stationer and citizen of London, for nine years, from Easter 1564, and probably took his freedom of the company about the period covered by the break in the records.

He brought out many theological works and translations from the French; to some of the latter the letters E. A. are affixed, giving rise to the opinion that they were translated by Aggas himself. Ames says that he was more of a bookseller than printer, and dwelt at the sign of the Dragon in the west end of St. Paul's Churchyard.

The theory also tries to explain the Great Divergence, the overtaking of China by the Western world (Europe and North America) as the major economic and industrial world power during the 19-20th centuries. Specifically, the theory seeks to explain how Europe could experience an industrial revolution, but China did not. Theory supporters claim that although the prosperous Song and Ming dynasties moved China toward a modern age, the restrictions placed on commerce and industry and the persecution of non-orthodox thought after the Transition from Ming to Qing caused the country to stagnate and fall behind the West. Background Carl Dahlman and Jean-Eric Aubert of the World Bank argue, based on Angus Maddison's data, that China was the world's largest and most advanced economy for the most of the past two millennia and among the wealthiest and most advanced economies until the 18th century.Dahlman, Carl J; Aubert, Jean-Eric. China and the Knowledge Economy: Seizing the 21st Century. WBI Development Studies. World Bank Publications. Accessed January 30, 2008 Sinologist Joseph Needham has claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by a substantial margin from the 5th century BC onwards, but economic historian Angus Maddison believes that did not happen until the fall of the Roman Empire. During the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), the country experienced a revolution in agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which drastically increased GDP per capita even further. China experienced an economic revolution in which the economy became proto- industrialized and experienced large increases in industrial and agricultural output. At the same time, overseas and domestic trade increased, along with the use of currency. Some scholars have termed the phenomenon China's \\"medieval urban revolution\\". Although China suffered large population loss and a devastated economy during the Mongol conquest, the succeeding Ming dynasty brought economic growth, with per capita incomes and economic output surpassing its highest point during the Song dynasty. Late Ming laissez-faire policies such as nonintervention in markets and low taxes further stimulated commerce and trade. During the Ming dynasty, the Chinese economy became very commercialised, as market agriculture replaced subsistence farming. Wage labour became increasingly common, as large-scale private industry developed, displacing and often buying out government workshops. Historian Robert Allen estimates that family incomes and labor productivity of the Ming-era Yangtze Delta Region, the richest province of China, was far higher than contemporary Europe and exceeded the later Qing dynasty., figure 2 In addition to being a period of wealth and economic growth, the late Ming dynasty also brought intellectual fervor and liberalization. New thinkers like Wang Yangming and Li Zhi challenged orthodox Confucianism and argued that the words of Confucius and Mencius were fallible and that wisdom was universal. They also questioned government power over the economy and personal rights. Scholars of the Donglin school protested increases in government taxation during the Wanli Emperor, and restrictions on freedom of speech, advocating a program similar to classical liberalism. Ming dynasty scholars also adopted western science, including that of Archimedes. Additional scientific advancement also flourished during the late Ming dynasty. Supporters of the theory contend that the economic and social developments during the late Ming paralleled the development of Europe in the 18th and the 19th centuries and would have allowed China to enter a modern age without the Manchu conquest and then the Qing dynasty. Evidence Supporters of the theory believe that the policies of the Qing Dynasty slowed China's advancement, which allowed Western nations to surpass China's prosperity during the medieval and the early modern eras. Specific Qing policies cited include literary persecution, interventions in foreign trade and domestic policies and restoration of serfdom as well as the devastation of the initial conquest itself. = Restrictions on foreign trade = Supporters most often point to Qing restriction on foreign trade as evidence of the theory. During the Ming dynasty, considerable commerce existed between China, Japan and Western Europe, estimated by Joseph Needham at nearly 300 million taels of silver from 1578 to 1644 (for comparison, the total Ming state revenues were from 20 to 30 million taels). However, during the Qing dynasty, foreign trade was prohibited completely from 1644 to 1683, and it later restricted to only one port at Guangzhou. In addition, commerce had to be conducted by 13 guilds approved by the government, with competition prohibited. The government also refused to provide protection to overseas Chinese. The emperor did not protest the massacres carried out by the Spanish and Dutch colonial authorities against the Chinese, such as what happened in the Spanish Philippines. =Restoration of serfdom= The restoration of serfdom is cited as another policy that greatly hampered the Chinese economy. Qing forces expropriated huge amounts of land, turning millions of people from tenant farmers into hereditary serfs. The amount of land requisitioned amounted to nearly 16 million mou, or nearly 10,666 km¬≤, of farmland. Serfdom was so common in the early Qing that slave markets were set up to buy and sell those who had been enslaved during the Qing expansion. = Literary persecution = While literary persecution existed in China prior to Qing rule, it was rare and never widespread. During the late Ming dynasty, protests by scholars forced the government to declare that \\"speech will not be criminalized\\". However, the Qing government frequently used literary persecution to destroy opposition to Qing rule. Several cases of literary persecution saw hundreds of intellectuals and their families executed, often for minor offenses such as referring to Manchus as \\"barbarians\\" and using the Qing character in areas that was deemed offensive by the government. Thousands of ancient texts deemed subversive were burned in the persecutions. Protests by scholars, which had been common during the late Ming period, were also suppressed. The persecutions extended to non-orthodox thought as well; scholars who disagreed with the standard Neo-Confucian theories were executed along with a scientist who argued that the brain, rather than the heart, was the centre of thought. =Domestic intervention= The Qing dynasty intervened in the economy far more than its predecessors. Unlike the Ming dynasty, who had adopted laissez-faire policies, there was frequent intervention in the economy by restricting the number of merchants allowed to operate. The official edicts discouraged the cultivation of commercial crops, in favour of subsistence agriculture. Also, most new mines were prohibited. Supporters of the theory claim that such policies greatly damaged the Chinese economy. =Devastation of initial conquest= The Ming-Qing transition was one of the most devastating wars in Chinese history, and it set back Chinese progress decades. Examples of the devastation include the Yangzhou massacre in which some 800,000 people, including women and children, were massacred by the Manchus.Wang Shochu, Records of the Ten Day massacre in Yangzhou. Available in Chinese at Wikisource: ÊèöÂ∑ûÂçÅÊó•Ë®ò. Whole provinces, such as Sichuan and Jiangnan, were thoroughly devastated and depopulated by the Manchu conquest, which killed an estimated 25 million people. Some scholars estimate that the Chinese economy did not the regain the level reached in the late Ming dynasty until 1750, nearly a century after the foundation of the Qing dynasty. According to economic historian Robert Allen, family incomes in the Yangtze delta, China's richest province, was actually below Ming levels in 1820 but equal to that of contemporary Britain., table 7 The destructive effects of the Qing were felt economically for decades. In the 1690s, Tang Chen (ÈôàÂîê), a retired Chinese scholar and failed merchant wrote: > More than fifty years have passed since the founding of the [Qing] dynasty, > and the empire grows poorer each day. Farmers are destitute, artisans are > destitute, merchants are destitute, and officials too are destitute. Grain > is cheap, yet it is hard to eat one‚Äôs fill. Cloth is cheap, yet it is hard > to cover one‚Äôs skin. Boatloads of goods travel from one marketplace to > another, but the cargoes must be sold at a loss. Officials upon leaving > their posts discover they have no wherewithal to support their households. > Indeed the four occupations are all impoverished! Criticism Kenneth Pomeranz, a noted critic of the theory, rejects the assertion that \\"certain Asian societies were headed toward an industrial breakthrough until [British invaders] crushed the 'sprouts of capitalism'\\". He also holds that the Qing \\"revitalization of the state\\" had a positive effect on the Chinese economy.

Facts Mr Wilson worked for the Daily Mail newspaper. The paper derecognised the National Union of Journalists. Pay was increased for workers who took individual contracts, instead of staying on terms negotiated through collective agreement. Mr Wilson chose not to shift to an individual contract. His salary was not increased as quickly as those of the rest of his colleagues. Mr Palmer worked for the ports in Southampton. His employer offered him an individual contract, coupled with a 10% pay increase, but on the condition that he would cease to be represented by the union, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. Mr Palmer refused to move to an individual contract. Unlike that of the other workers, his pay was increased by 8.9%, and he did not benefit as others did from a private medical insurance plan. The company then derecognised the union. Both parties, together with their union, complained that their right to take part in trade union activities was violated under UK law, and if not that UK law, in particular under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 148(3) failed to comply with international standards, and the European Convention on Human Rights article 11. Judgment =Court of Appeal= In the Court of Appeal Dillon LJ, Butler-Sloss LJ and Farquharson LJ heldAssociated Newspapers Ltd v Wilson [1995] 2 All ER 100 that the employers' conduct had infringed the then-effective Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 s 23. The employers' action was intended to deter employees from being trade union members and such deterrence was a wholly foreseeable consequence. =House of Lords= In the House of Lords, Lord Keith, Lord Bridge, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Slynn and Lord Lloyd overturned the Court of Appeal.Associated Newspapers Ltd v Wilson [1995] 2 AC 454, [1995] 2 WLR 354 They held that employers withholding a pay rise from employees was not \\"action short of dismissal\\". It was an omission, and should be interpreted as such given the complex legislative history of the provision. Moreover, the Tribunal had never established that the employers' purpose was to deter its employees from joining a union or penalising them from membership. So the legislation here did not protect Wilson or Palmer's activities. Nicholas Underhill QC and Brian Napier acted for Associated Newspapers, and Patrick Elias QC and Nigel Giffin acted for Associated British Ports, while John Hendy QC and Jennifer Eady acted for Mr Wilson and Jeffrey Burke QC and Peter Clark acted for Mr Palmer. =European Court of Human Rights= The European Court of Human Rights held that the effect of UK law was to allow employers to treat employees that were unprepared to renounce the right to consult a union less favourably. The use of financial incentives to induce employees to surrender union rights violated ECHR article 11, since it effectively frustrated the union's ability to strive for protection of its members. Unions have the right to make representations to employers and ultimately take action to protect their interests. Significance Having been found to stand in breach of international labour law standards in general, and ECHR art 11 in particular, the UK government set about consulting on how to amend TULRCA 1992 to comply with the judgment, but with the objective of changing the law no further than absolutely necessary to comply with the ruling. The result was the Employment Relations Act 2004, which changed, in particular, TULRCA 1992 section 146 to stipulate that all \\"workers\\" were protected by the provisions on detriment for union membership and activities.

It lies mostly in south and eastern Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and Upstate New York in the United States. Setting This area includes much of northern New York state (save for the Adirondacks), western Vermont, the Saint Lawrence Lowlands in southern Quebec and most of southern Ontario between Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. The region includes the Frontenac Axis, the Niagara Escarpment up to Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron, and Lake Simcoe. Meanwhile, the forests south of Lake Ontario are classified as the Southern Great Lakes forests ecoregion and in Canada the higher elevations of the Canadian Appalachian Mountains and the Laurentian Mountains constitute the Eastern Canadian forests. This region has warm summers and cold, snowy winters. Flora This ecoregion is a transition area between the taiga to the north and the temperate deciduous forest to the south and thus contains a variety of habitats including freshwater marshes, dunes, bogs, fens, and hardwood and conifer swamps. Trees of the woodland include eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), pines, maple, and oaks. Particular areas include the oak/pine mix of the Albany Pine Bush, areas of dry rocky alvar plain, and the white cedars (Thuja occidentalis) of the Niagara Escarpment. Fauna The Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests are very rich in wildlife. Birds include cardinals, downy woodpecker, wood duck and eastern screech owl. Large mammals including American black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces alces), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) have been removed from this ecoregion and remaining mammals include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Threats and preservation The Saint Lawrence River is one of the most polluted in the world and these surrounding forests are vulnerable to clearance for agriculture and urban development including the cities of Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec City and suburbs of Toronto, Syracuse and Albany, New York. Less than 5% of natural forest remains intact. The fragmented blocks of remaining habitat include: the eastern end of Lake Ontario; Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Vermont; the Chaumont Barrens, Rome Sand Plains, the Albany Pine Bush and the proposed Split Rock Wildway in New York; Bruce Peninsula (the barrier between Georgian Bay and the main section of Lake Huron), Alfred Bog, Luther Marsh, the Ganaraska Forest and Carden Plain in Ontario; and Mont Saint-Hilaire, Lac Saint-Fran√ßois National Wildlife Area and Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Areas in Quebec.

Life  Singh was born to wrestler Javala Singh Sandhu and Sahib Kaur. His parents were farmers of moderate means in the village of Chanteke, Lahore district (now in Pakistan). Singh trained as a wrestler in his mother's native village, Nurpur, under the village potter, before returning to Chanteke to continue training with wrestler Vasava Sing. Singh was already a popular wrestler when he started his tutelage under Buta Pahilvan, Rustam-i-Hind, of Lahore. Singh developed world class skill, and eventually became the leading Indian wrestler. He enjoyed the patronage of the rulers of the princely states of Jodhpur, Indore, Dasuya, Tonk and Jammu and Kashmir. There are several theories on why he came to be known as Kikkar Singh. One theory is that he once uprooted a kikkar tree (acacia) with his bare hands. Another states that he earned his botanical name due to his extraordinary height and dark complexion, which were uncommon for the time. Kikkar Singh fought and won many bouts during his lifetime. In fact, there were not many competitors to match his strength and skill. However, he lost the last bout of his life. During the Delhi Durbar, held in December 1911 to celebrate the coronation of King George V, Singh was challenged by a younger wrestler and an old rival, Kallu of Amritsar. Singh, at 54, was long past his prime and already asthmatic, but he would not let the challenge go unanswered. He put up a considerable fight to the delight of the elite gathering (Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala and Sardul Singh Caveeshar were among the spectators), but lost. To many eyewitnesses it appeared to be a dubious judgement. Kikkar Singh died on 18 February 1914 in his native village, where a samadhi or memorial shrine has been raised in his memory.

It suffered a major fire in 1908 in which 26 men died.  History  The Hamstead Colliery Company was formed in April 1875. It acquired land in an area of Staffordshire, on what is now the north west border of Birmingham, from G.C. Calthorpe of nearby Perry Hall, and in 1876 sank shafts. The first coal was not extracted until after 1878 due to unexpected geological problems and water ingress. The coal was at a very deep level of almost 2000 feet. It closed in 1898 due to a fire in the workings, throwing 800 men out of work. With the Midlands facing an acute coal shortage it reopened on 8 January 1900. In 1928, due to boundary changes, the mine head area became part of West Bromwich. Shortly afterwards, the mine was acquired by the Hamstead Colliery (1930) Ltd. After nationalisation on the first day of 1947, when it became part of the National Coal Board, it continued to produce coal profitably until 1965 when the mine closed and housing was built on the site of the pithead.

Background Vans Agnew's monument at Multan Fort Vans Agnew was the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Vans Agnew, a Madras officer of considerable reputation, and afterwards a director of the East India Company. India After a very successful career at Haileybury College, where he gave evidence of superior talent and of judgment and force of character in advance of his years, Agnew joined the Bengal civil service in March 1841, and in the following year commenced his official life as assistant to the commissioner of the Delhi division. In December 1845 he was appointed assistant to Major George Broadfoot, the superintendent of the Cis-Sutlej states, and was present at the Battle of Sobraon early in 1846. He was subsequently employed in settling the boundaries of the territory of Maharaja Gulab Singh, the new ruler of Kashmir, and in a mission to Gilgit. Chain of Events In the spring of 1848, being then assistant to the resident at Lahore, he was sent to Multan with instructions to take over the government of that province from Mulraj, the Nazim or governor, who had applied to be relieved of it, and to make it over to Sardar Kahan Singh Mann, a Sikh noble, remaining himself in the capacity of political agent to introduce a new system of finance and revenue. On this mission he was accompanied by Lieutenant W. A. Anderson, of the Bombay Army, who had been his assistant on his mission to Gilgit, and also by Sardar Kahan Singh Mann, the dewan designate, and an escort of Sikh troops. The mission reached Multan on 18 April 1848. On the following day Agnew and Anderson were visited by Mulraj, and some discussion, not altogether harmonious, took place as to the terms upon which the province should be given over, Agnew demanding that the accounts for the six previous years should be produced. On 20 April, the two English officers inspected Multan Fort and the various establishments, and on their return to their camp in company with Mulraj were attacked and wounded (Anderson severely) by the retainers of Mulraj, who immediately rode off at full speed to his country residence. The two wounded Englishmen were placed by their attendants in an idgah, or fortified temple, where, on the following day, their Sikh escort having gone over to the enemy, they were brutally murdered by the adherents of Mulraj. This incident, so important in its political results, produced a profound sensation throughout India. Both the murdered officers, though young in years (Agnew would have been twenty-six had he lived one day longer), had already established a high reputation in the public service. Anderson had some time previously attracted the favourable notice of Sir Charles Napier in Sind, and the duties upon which Agnew had been employed, including his last most responsible and, as the event proved, fatal mission, sufficed to show the high estimation in which his services were held. Nor was it only as a rising public servant that Patrick Vans Agnew's death was mourned. In private life his brave, modest, and unselfish nature had won the esteem and affection of all who knew him. \\"If,\\" wrote Sir Herbert Edwardes to one of his nearest relatives, \\"few of our countrymen in this land of death and disease have met more untimely ends than your brother, it has seldom been the lot of any to be so honoured and lamented.\\" Monument A monument was erected for Vans Agnew after the Siege of Multan.

In 1780 he obtained a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, and retained it until 1793. He graduated as B.A. in 1781, and took the degree of M.A. in 1784. On 29 May 1793 he was married to Anne Broughton, of Canonbury Place, Islington, a daughter of the Rev. Thomas Broughton. Agutter does not seem to have held any preferment in the English church, but in 1797 he was appointed to the post of chaplain and secretary to the Asylum for Female Orphans in London. He enjoyed a high reputation as a preacher, and many of his sermons were printed by request. The best known of them was preached at St. Mary's, Oxford, before the university on 23 July 1786, and consisted of an orthodox description of ‚Äòthe difference between the death of the righteous and the wicked, illustrated in the instance of Dr. Samuel Johnson and David Hume, Esq.‚Äô He was much attached to that eccentric prodigy of learning, John Henderson, and when his friend died at Oxford in 1788, he accompanied the corpse to Kingswood near Bristol and preached the funeral sermon on the loss which learning had sustained by his death. It was published in the same year. Agutter was the author of several other sermons on such topics as the miseries of rebellion and the abolition of the slave trade. He died at Upper Gower Street, London, on 26 March 1835.

The name appeared in maps from ancient times up to the turn of the 19th century.1799 James Rennell map with the Aethiopian Sea in the Gulf of Guinea area. Geography The originally Greek term Okeanos Aithiopos is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean. It is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow region between Natal, Brazil and Monrovia, Liberia. The term Ethiopian Ocean appeared until the mid-19th century, for example on the map Accuratissima Totius Africae in Lucem Producta, engraved by Johann Baptist Homann and Frederick de Wit and published by Jacob von Sandrart in N√ºrnberg in 1702.Accuratissima Totius Africae in Lucem Producta 1702 map The name Aethiopian was related to the fact that, historically, Africa west and south of Egypt was known as Aethiopia.

He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp graduating with a BA in Fashion Design in 1999. Pieters is highly regarded for his avant-garde creations and sharp tailoring. He worked with renowned designers including Martin Margiela, Josephus Thimister and Christian Lacroix to develop his talent. After a two-year break he introduced his comeback label Honest By Bruno Pieters in 2012. Life and career Two years after his graduation in 1999, Bruno Pieters launched his first collection in July 2001 during Paris Fashion Week. The next year, he introduced his ready- to-wear collection for both male as female. Praised by Vogue international editor and fashion journalist Suzy Menkes and other fashion critics, his career took flight. As result, in 2005 Pieters was named creative director of the men‚Äôs line at the Belgian brand Delvaux, the oldest fine leather luxury goods company in the world. He fulfilled this position two years and, in 2007 he was asked to become creative director of the avant-garde line HUGO by the German brand Hugo Boss. During his time as art director for Delvaux and Hugo Boss, Pieters was still working on his own name label. He can be seen as a technician, a constructor, one who experiments with profiles and proportions. One of the features of his work is the combination of perfect cuts and homage to craftsmanship. The autumn/winter collection of 2009-2010 proves this feature, focusing on geometrically constructed skirts, dresses and hooded jackets. In addition, his spring/summer collection of 2010 explored a new form of the bandage dress, gently wrapped around the body in constructed geometric diagonal layers. After launching the spring/summer collection of 2010, Pieters decided to take a break from his fashion career. In that same year, he ended the collaboration with Hugo Boss. As a result, much of his collection archive was given to the MoMu Fashion museum of Antwerp, while the rest was sold to give the funds to SISP, a children‚Äôs charity in Southern India. The choice for this charity was no coincidence as Pieters spent his break from the fashion industry mainly in India. Simultaneously, his experiences in India emerged awareness and need to create a new model for the fashion industry. This resulted in his comeback label Honest By Bruno Pieters in 2012. Current label =Honest By= Confronted by the injustice of the supply chain and the poor working conditions in countries such as India, Bruno Pieters wants to focus on sustainable fashion and transparency. His new innovative label Honest By is avant-garde, luxury fashion that is mostly sustainable, mostly organic and financially transparent. In addition, twenty percent of the profit of his label goes to charity. The sustainability is featured in the use of mainly organic, natural and animal friendly materials. Bruno Pieters also wants to make his design sustainable by producing something you can wear and enjoy more than just one season, a collection designed to last. For example, his autumn/winter collection of 2012-2013 is a reinvention of classics such as the trench coat, the bomber jacket and jeans. Pieters deconstructs and reconstructs existing fashion classics to make it into something new but still classical, introducing the term neo-classic hybrids. Furthermore, Honest By shows people where the materials come from, how much they cost, who made the product, where it was made and how much money everybody earns along the supply chain. As result of this 100% transparency, Bruno Pieters wants to make consumers aware and critical about where clothes come from and how they are produced. He also emphasises the influence consumers can have on clothing companies if they ask questions and express their demands. In his vision to change the model of the fashion industry, making it more sustainable and transparent, Bruno Pieters has launched the Future Fashion Designer Scholarship for upcoming designers. The aim of the FFDS is to give fashion design students the opportunity to develop their graduation collection in a responsible, sustainable and transparent manner. The winner of the FFDS receives 10.000 euro cash and guidance from Bruno Pieters himself to make his or her debut as fashion designer.

The site is situated from Indore and from Dhar on the Indore-Ahmedabad Highway. It was established by Acharya Rajendrasuri (1826‚Äì1906), around 1884 and is today an important Gyana kshetra or Jain center of learning as well. This tirtha has a statue of the first Tirthankara, in the lotus position, and the samadhi derasar of Acharyas Rajendrasuri, Yatindrasuri and Vidhyachandrasuri. A fair is held here every year on the fifteenth day of the bright half of the month of Kartika, the month of Chaitra, and the seventh day of the bright half of the month of Pausha. History In 1884, the reformer Acharya Rajendrasuri was wandering about through this place, seeing the natural and peaceful atmosphere. He predicted that this land would rise in holiness, and there would be a great tirtha. Accordingly, a holy tirtha came into existence here. In 1884, on Margshirsha Shukla 7th, all Jina bimbas including Rishab Bhagwan were established after anjan shalaka by Pujya Gurudev Rajendrasuri ji. Pujya Gurudev declared after puja that this derasar will be called a great pilgrim place. It should be named \\"Mohankheda\\" hence after. In 1906, Acharya Rajendrasuri died in Rajgarh. Thousands of his disciples bid him goodbye and paid their last homage to him on the ground of Jinalaya on Pausha Sudi 7th. His disciples constructed a memorial samadhi temple, and a fair started taking place on Pausha Sudi 7th. Mohankheda Tirtha is over 132 years old and full of peaceful atmosphere. The old temple was renovated in 1957, and its murti were re-established by the chief disciple of Yatindrasuri and Chandrasuri. The new temple has images of Rishabhanatha, Parshvanatha and others. In front of Jinalaya, there is a temple memorialising Rajendrasuri. There is another in front of this one in the memory of Dhanchandrasuri, including statues of Shrimad Bupendra Surishwarji and Mohan Vijayji. On the main gate, a temple has been built in memory of chief disciples of Yatindrasuri, and near Dharmashala there is a memorial temple of motivator builder of renovated temple, Shrimada Vijaya Vidyachandra Surishwarji. Both of the gurus had sought salvation on this holy land. Today Mohankheda has developed as a grand place of pilgrimage. There are many big rest houses, having 500 rooms for the comfort and convenience of the visitors. The visitors get free breakfast, lunch and dinner under the care of 'Shri Adinath Rajendra Jain Shwetamber Cheritable Trust'. Adinath Jain Gurukul is being run in connection with training of Jain culture and religion. There are also three academic schools named: Shri Rajendra Vidhya Sanskar Vakita Progressive School, Shri Rajendra Vidhya Sankar Dhamhttp://www.srvsanskardham.org/, and Guru Rajendra Jain International Schoolhttp://gururajendrajis.com/school/. All these three schools are run by Shri Mohankheda Tirth Trust. Guru Saptami Mahotsav Acharya Rajendrasuri (1826‚Äì1906) was a major reformer of the 18th and 19th century in the Svetambara sect of Jainism. He was born on 3 December 1827, at Bharatpur (Rajasthan), in the family of the businessman named Rishabhadas Parakh. His born name was Ratna Raj. He had a religious bent of mind. He renounced the worldly life and was initiated as Jain yati by Hemavijayaji at Udaipur in 1846 AD. He had studied diligently the Jain scriptures, philosophy, literature, grammar, rhetoric, lexicography, etc. under Acharya Pramodsuri and Jain Monk Sagarchandji, the well-known yatis of the age, and soon he acquired proficiency. He raised his voice against the corrupt and luxurious life of the Jain yatis and condemned their abundance of possession and insisted on a pious ideal life in accordance with the principles laid down by Jain Tirthankaras and Jain holy scriptures. He also took vigorous attempts to reform the institution of Jain yati and place it on sound, simple and rational principles, and get rid of its age old traditions and superstitions. Though opposed in the initial stages, the attempts of Rajendrasuri were ultimately crowned with success. As a result of this, the Jain yatis/Monk had given up their worldly life and surrendered their princely symbols like silver rods, chanwar, palkhi, arms, etc. to the Jain temples, and took solemn oath to lead a life of purity, simplicity, non-possession, non-violence, teaching and preaching. Thus Rajendrasuri reformed and simplified the Jain yati/monk institution, Tristutik sect of Jainism, and a new life of revivalism was infused in them. His other achievements were restoration and reconstruction of Jain temples and installation of Jain images and establishment of different socio-religious organizations for the uplift of the Jains and propagation of Jainism. On Friday 21 December 1906, Vikram Samvat 1963 Poush Shukla Saptami, the great helping nature, Religious-Preacher Acharya Rajendrasuri laid down his body for the Moksha Prapti (for heaven) until death in a still Samadhi. He was considered a great saint, who was in his own a different kind, having the same day of birth and death. After the 100 years of Nirvan, Shri Mohankheda Tirth is the most-reputed holy place all over the world. Every year devotees from all over world (in lakhs) gather here to attain the Spiritual and Chamatkarik Aarti of Acharya Rajendrasuri on his birth and Nirvana day in the month of Poush shukla paksha Saptami.

Douglas Strain was the company's CEO and board chairman from 1953 until 1980 and remained on the board (continuing as chairman until 1985, then vice chairman) until fully retiring in 1999. In the 1950s, the company's specialty was the manufacture of high- precision resistance measuring instruments and related products. In 1970, ESI began developing laser trimming systems for resistor circuits, and soon became a leader in this field. ESI's headquarters campus building 4 All facilities were located at S.E. 43rd & Stark in Portland until 1956, when the first stage of a new headquarters and manufacturing plant on Macadam Avenue, in South Portland, was opened. The new plant was destroyed by fire in 1957\\"$200,000 Fire Sears Plant\\" (July 19, 1957). The Oregonian, p. 1. and had to be rebuilt. In 1962, ESI announced plans to create a new development called \\"Sunset Science Park\\", to be built in the Cedar Mill area of unincorporated Washington County, Oregon, designed to attract other technology companies, with ESI as an anchor.Pratt, Gerry (January 21, 1962). \\"Cedar Hills [sic] Area Receives New 50-Acre Science Park\\". The Sunday Oregonian, p. 1. The company moved its headquarters to the Sunset Science Park location in 1963, and the manufacturing facilities followed in 1966, vacating the Macadam Avenue site. The complex on N.W. Science Park Drive, which remains ESI's headquarters today, has a Portland mailing address, but is not in the city of Portland proper; it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of Beaverton. ESI became a publicly traded company in 1983. It traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol ESIO. The company opened its first foreign sales office in 1978, in Munich, Germany, and later opened offices in several countries in Southeast Asia. As of 2007 the company also had offices for direct sales in several European countries, as well. Several small companies were acquired by ESI in the late 1990s, including Dynamotion Corp. (of California) in 1997, Chip Star Inc. (California) in 1997, Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) (Michigan) in 1997 and Testec Corp. (Arizona) in 1999. A new manufacturing facility was opened in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in early 2001. The company acquired California-based New Wave Research Inc. in 2007. At the beginning of 2009, Electro Scientific had around 700 employees, about half of whom were located in Oregon. Edward C. Grady was named as the president and CEO of ESI in February 2014. The company acquired fiber laser manufacturer Eolite Systems in June 2012, the semiconductor systems business from GSI Group in May 2013, and Chinese laser firm Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co. in January 2015. In August 2016, the company announced that Michael Burger, formerly CEO of Cascade Microtech, would succeed Edward Grady as CEO effective October 3, 2016. =Annexation fight= In 2005, ESI joined Columbia Sportswear, Tektronix and other Washington County companies in an effort led by Nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of \\"islands\\" of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city. The Nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of Beaverton in 2004, under which the city had added more than of unincorporated land, including the headquarters of Leupold & Stevens (located almost adjacent to ESI, but on the opposite side of the Sunset Highway freeway). Although the headquarters of ESI and Columbia are not on \\"islands\\" surrounded by Beaverton, both directly abut the city boundary, and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the city's annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island. The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property--whether an island or not--for at least 30 years.Oregon State Bill 887 as enrolled , from the Oregon State Legislature website.

Prelude Two months after the decisive Portuguese victory in the Battle of Aljubarrota, the Constable of Portugal Nuno √Ålvares Pereira had decided to take the offensive and invade Castile. The Portuguese army departed from Estremoz, passing by Vila Vi√ßosa and Oliven√ßa. He then entered into Castilian territory, where he took Villagarcia, which he found undefended, from here he then proceeded to the town of Valverde. While waiting for reinforcements, the Castilians marched on to face the Portuguese and prevent them from crossing the river Guadiana. The Castilian reinforcements were made up mainly of local townspeople and the army numbered about 20,000 men, with the presence of several nobles. Among them, the Master of the Order of Calatrava, Gonzalo N√∫√±ez de Guzman, the Master of the Order of Alc√°ntara, the Portuguese Martim Anes de Barbuda and Pedro Mu√±iz de Godoy y Sandoval, Grand Master of the Order of Santiago. Battle A portion of the Castilian army crossed the river and placed themselves on the opposite shore, while the rest remained where they were with the plan of surrounding the Portuguese while they crossed the river. Nuno √Ålvares Pereira then ordered his army to form a square with the baggage on the center, and impetuously crossed the Castilian forces, which attempted to oppose him. Upon reaching the river shore, Nuno √Ålvares Pereira ordered his rearguard to protect the baggage and fight the enemy, while with his vanguard he crossed over. The Castilian forces on the opposite shore, numbering about 10,000 men, unsuccessfully oppose their landing. After placing the Portuguese vanguard in position, defending the shore from the Castilians, Nuno √Ålvares Pereira again crossed the river to reach his rearguard, which was under a rain of arrows launched from the Castilian side. The Constable of Portugal noticing that the Castilians had used all of their projectiles, ordered an attack. Nuno √Ålvares Pereira himself, seeing the banner of the Grand Master of Santiago, fought his way through the Castilian army until encountering him, and after a brief duel, the Grand Master fell mortally wounded.Richard Henry Major, p.20 With his fall and the overthrow of his standard, the Castilian army demoralized and was soon broken and in disorder, and could not stop the Portuguese attack, being quickly and totally defeated.Jean Froissart,Sainte-Palaye , p.165 Aftermath The Portuguese army pursued the Castilians till nightfall, returning to Portugal in the morning.Richard Henry Major, p.21 The disaster that Castile experienced at Aljubarrota was thus quickly followed by another crushing defeat at Valverde.

Schweich (October 2, 1960 ‚Äì February 26, 2015) was an American politician, diplomat, attorney, and author. A member of the Republican Party, Schweich served as State Auditor of Missouri. Prior to being elected State Auditor, he served as the U.S. Coordinator for Counternarcotics and Justice Reform in Afghanistan. While in that position, he was given the rank of Ambassador by U.S. President George W. Bush. In the 2010 election, Schweich was elected State Auditor, defeating Democratic incumbent Susan Montee. He was reelected in 2014 without opposition. In 2015, Schweich announced he would run for Governor of Missouri in the 2016 election. On February 26, 2015, he died as a result of injuries sustained from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  Education and legal career  Schweich was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Brigitte and Julius Schweich. He was a fifth generation Missourian and a graduate of Missouri's public school system. Schweich was not Jewish but believed that there was an anti-Semitic whispering campaign preceding his death which suggested that he was Jewish. One investigative reporter has been unable to determine the authenticity of the claims, and whether or not they were being used for political gain. His paternal grandfather was Jewish. Schweich attended an Episcopal church. Schweich received his undergraduate degree from Yale University, and he obtained his law degree from Harvard Law School. After law school he joined the oldest law firm in Missouri, Bryan Cave. As a partner at Bryan Cave, Schweich specialized in corporate compliance, helping to manage internal audits and investigations for large companies.  Public service career  =Danforth Special Counsel Investigation into Waco Siege= Schweich began his public service career in 1999, when he was named Chief of Staff for former U.S. Senator John Danforth's investigation of the federal government's actions in connection with the 1993 FBI siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas; a siege which resulted in the deaths of over 80 people, including 23 children. The investigation concluded that the Davidians died as a result of a suicide pact, but it also uncovered numerous instances of negligent conduct in the way that the federal government conducted the siege. =United Nations= John Danforth appointed Schweich to be his chief of staff when he was the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Schweich also served as chief of staff to the next two ambassadors to the United Nations, Anne W. Patterson and John R. Bolton. During his time serving the United Nations delegation, he helped the delegation uncover the Oil for Food Scandal, a scheme by Saddam Hussein to circumvent United Nations sanctions using bribery and kickbacks to U .N. and other officials. =Bush administration= In 2005, Schweich became the second-highest ranking and then highest-ranking international law enforcement official in the U.S. State Department as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and Acting Assistant Secretary of State at the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. He directed four thousand people located in dozens of countries with a budget of more than 2.5 billion dollars. He was subsequently appointed Coordinator for Counternarcotics and Justice Reform in Afghanistan and was accorded the rank of Ambassador by President George W. Bush. =Missouri Auditor= In 2010, Schweich sought and won the Republican nomination for Missouri State Auditor, defeating Missouri State Representative Allen Icet with 58.6% of the vote. In the general election, he faced incumbent and Democratic nominee Susan Montee. Schweich defeated Montee on November 2, 2010, with a 51% to 45% margin of victory. Schweich made history in the 2014 election when the Democratic party failed to field a candidate against him. The race marks the first time in 144 years that a Republican has run for a Missouri statewide office without any Democratic opposition. Democrats attributed Schweich's implementation of an anti- embezzlement program, rapid response team, and grading system, strong fundraising numbers, and broad bipartisan support of his audits as reasons why he did not draw Democratic opposition for re-election. In the general election, he was re-elected with 73% of the vote to Libertarian Sean O'Toole's 20% and Constitution nominee Rodney Farthing's 7%. =2016 campaign for governor= On January 28, 2015, Schweich announced he would run for Governor of Missouri, setting the stage for a Republican primary with former Missouri House Speaker Catherine Hanaway.McDermott, Kevin (January 28, 2015) - \\"It's Official: Schweich to Fight Hanaway for 2016 GOP Governor Nomination\\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Retrieved February 23, 2015.  Writing career and personal interests  In addition to his public service career, Schweich was an avid numismatist and a collector of movie memorabilia. He wrote three books and numerous articles on topics including business law, numismatic history and international relations. Accolades for his work include three literary awards from the American Numismatic Association. He wrote his first book, Protect Yourself From Business Lawsuits (‚Ä¶and Lawyers Like Me) (Simon & Schuster), in 1998, and it became the best selling business law book on Amazon.com. He wrote his second book, Crashproof Your Life: A Comprehensive Three-Part Plan for Avoiding Financial Disasters (McGraw-Hill), in 2002. He wrote his third book, Staying Power (McGraw-Hill), in 2003. In addition, he recorded an audio series on personal finance entitled \\"Protect Your Wealth,\\" which was released in 2004. Before becoming state auditor, Schweich was a member of the Washington University faculty, where he taught law and foreign policy. Death and aftermath On February 26, 2015, Schweich was taken from his home to a St. Louis hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound, later ruled to be self- inflicted. His office soon confirmed that he had died. Governor Jay Nixon decreed that flags would be flown at half-staff in his memory. In early March 2015, an aide to former U.S. Senator Danforth, Martha Fitz, told a reporter with the Kansas City Star that she had spoken with Schweich by phone only minutes before the auditor's suicide, and that he expressed to her frustration and outrage over what he described as a \\"whisper campaign\\" by some Republicans to spread false information about him and damage his gubernatorial campaign. Fitz was talking with Schweich's wife, who had initiated the call, when the fatal shot was fired. However, after a thorough investigation, police found no evidence of a whisper campaign against Schweich. Instead, after interviews with family, it was revealed that Schweich had threatened suicide several times over many years, sometimes while holding a gun. Also, officers found 23 different prescription medications at Schweich‚Äôs house he had been taking for various illnesses and diseases. Some prominent state figures openly cast blame on the Republicans, particularly their campaign manager Jeff Roe, for willfully growing a \\"toxic campaign culture\\". The ad that aired early in the campaign mocked Schweich for his physical appearance and called him a \\"little bug\\". During Schweich's eulogy at a memorial service on March 3, 2015, former U.S. Senator John Danforth said that words used by others to describe Schweich constituted \\"bullying\\" and contributed to his death. \\"Politics\\", he lamented, \\"has gone so hideously wrong.\\" The Clayton Police Department conducted an investigation into Schweich's death by conducting interviews and searching through his electronic devices to examine his texts, emails, and voice mails. They found no evidence of the alleged whisper campaign and found no evidence that Schweich was the target of bullying, threats, or blackmail. On March 29, 2015, Robert \\"Spence\\" Jackson, 44, the spokesman for the Missouri State Auditor's office since October 2011, was found dead at his home in Jefferson City of a gunshot wound, an apparent suicide.

Corruption levels  Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 130 place out of 180 countries. As of 2019 the ranking is 146 out of 180 countries. Reformists and conservatives alike ‚Äì at times even the Supreme Leader ‚Äì routinely criticize corruption in the government. Although a Reuters special investigation has revealed Supreme Leader Khamenei controls a massive financial empire built on property seizures worth $95 billion dollars. Then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has vouched to fight \\"economic/oil Mafia\\" at all echelons of government. President Ahmadinejad has also proposed that lawmakers consider a bill, based on which the wealth and property of all officials who have held high governmental posts since 1979 could be investigated. Out of the $700 billion earned during the presidency of Ahmadinejad for the sale of oil, $150 billion dollars have disappeared. Many Iranians believe the country's economic problems are a byproduct of mismanagement and corruption. On February 3, 2013, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad played a video tape in the Iranian parliament that tied the heads of two branches of the government, the legislative and judiciary, to a documented financial corruption case related to the Larijani brothers. One of the objectives of the Iranian revolution was to have no social classes in Iran.

Corruption was a serious problem in the Pahlavi dynasty.Milani, p. 471 Stephanie Cronin of Oriental Institute, Oxford, describes corruption under rule of Reza Shah as \\"large- scale\\".Cronin, p. 6 As oil prices rose in 1973, scale of corruption also rose, particularly among royal family, their partners and friends. According to Manouchehr Ganji who created a study group for Farah Pahlavi, Mohammad Reza Shah was not sensitive to the issue, but addressed every now and then petty matters of low-ranking officials. As Ganji writes, the group submitted at least 30 solid reports within 13 years on corruption of high-ranking officials and the royal circle, but Shah called the reports \\"false rumors and fabrications\\". Parviz Sabeti, a high-ranking official of SAVAK believed that the one important reason for success of regime's opposition is corruption.Ganji, p. 8-9 According to report of a journal associated with The Pentagon, \\"By 1977 the sheer scale of corruption had reached a boiling point.... Even conservative estimates indicate that such [bureaucratic] corruption involved at least a billion dollars between 1973 and 1976.\\"Abrhamian (1982), p. 118 In Michel Foucault's view, corruption was a \\"glue\\" that kept the Pahlavi dynasty, despotism and modernization together.Afary and Anderson, p. 79 After the revolution, the Central Bank of Iran published a list of 177 prominent individuals who had recently transferred over $2 billion out of the country, among them:Abrahamian (1982), p. 517 *Jafar Sharif-Emami, some $31 million *Gholam Ali Oveisi, $15 million *Namazi, $9 million, *Nasser Moghadam, $2 million *\\"Mayor of Tehran\\", $6 million *\\"Minister of Health\\", $7 million *\\"Director of the National Iranian Oil Company\\", over $60 million = Corruption among the Royal family and court = Piaget Building, located in Manhattan, New York was designed for Pahlavi Foundation Built up by forced sales and confiscations of estates, Reza Shah was \\"the richest man in Iran\\" and \\"left to his heir a bank account of some 3 million pounds and estates totalling over 3 million acres.Abrahamian (1982), p. 137 A 1932 report of British Embassy in Tehran indicates that Reza Shah developed an \\"unholy interest in land\\" and jailed families until they agreed to sell their properties.Abrahamian (2008), p. 71 In the 1950s, Mohammad Reza Shah founded Pahlavi Foundation (now Alavi Foundation) which \\"penetrated almost every corner of the nation's economy\\".Abrahamian (1982), pp. 437-438 Bostock and Jones unambiguously declared that Pahlavi Foundation a \\"nominally charitable foundation fostered official corruption\\". According to Houchang Chehabi and Juan Linz, Alavi foundation's $1.05 billion assets, $81 million capital and its declared devined $4.2 million was the \\"tip of the iceberg of official and dynastical corruption, outside and inside Iran\\".Chehabi and Linz, p. 199 The foundation, which was one of his main wealth sources alongside estates left from Reza Shah and Iran's oil revenue, was a tax haven for his holdings. Many members of the Pahlavi clan were among the chief perpetrators of corruption in Iran.Azimi, p. 203 Royal court was described as \\"center of licentiousness and depravity, of corruption and influence peddling\\" in a mid-1970s CIA report. Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveyda who served from 1965 to 1977 had no choice but to facilitate or condone \\"the ubiquitous corruption of the Pahlavi Clan\\" and ignore \\"the corruption that saturated the regime\\".Azimi, p. 194 In 1960, there were rumours that Princess Ashraf, Shah's twin sister was arrested in Geneva carrying a suitcase containing $2 million worth of heroin. She was regarded as Iran's main drug dealer until 1979.Morrock, p. 144 A 1976 CIA report declared that she has a \\"near legendary reputation for financial corruption\\" and his son Shahram controls some-twenty companies that serve as \\"cover for Ashraf's quasi-legal business ventures\\". Prince Hamid Reza, the Shah's half-brother, was ostracized from the royal family because of his widespread scandals of promiscuity, addiction and involvement in drug trade.The Pahlavi Dynasty: An Entry from Encyclopedia of the World of Islam, p. 144 According to William Shawcross, hundreds of call girls from Madame Claude's establishment in Paris passed through Tehran for Mohammad Reza Shah and members of his court.Shawcross, p. 96 = Impact on the 1979 revolution = Some scholars have raised the point that widespread corruption among officials and royal court led to the public dissatisfaction and helped the Iranian Revolution.Harney, pp. 37, 47, 67, 128, 155, 167Mackay, pp. 236, 260 In Handbook of Crisis and Emergency Management, the Pahlavi dynasty is described as an example of governments losing legitimation because of corruption and facing a public service crisis as a result.Farazmand, p. 118 According to Fakhreddin Azimi, Professor of History at the University of Connecticut, \\"the unbridled misconduct of the Pahlavi clan undermined the Shah's proclaimed commitment to combating corruption and seriously damaged his credibility and Stature\\".Azimi, p. 204 Right before the revolution, in a 1978 National TV appeal to the nation, Shah said :Azimi, pp. 212-13 > I pledge that past mistakes, lawlessness, injustice, and corruption will not > only no longer be repeated, but will in every respect be rectified... I > guarantee that in future the government in Iran will be based on the > Constitution, social justice, and the will of the people, and will be free > from despotism, injustice, and corruption.

He belonged to the Anhui clique and formed the Anfu Club (). Later he became an important politician in the Provisional Government of the Republic of China and the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China. His former name was Zhiyang () and his courtesy names were Shenwu () and Shengong (). Later, his name was changed to Geng () while his courtesy name was changed to Yitang (). He was also known by his art name Yitang (). He was born in Hefei, Anhui.  Biography  = In the end of the Qing Dynasty = A native of Hefei in Anhui Province, Wang Yitang passed the imperial examination in 1904 for the highest degree jinshi; however, he hoped to study about the military. In September he was sent on a government scholarship to Japan, where he attended the Tokyo Shimbu Academy, a military preparatory school. After graduating he entered the Imperial Japanese Army‚Äôs 9th Artillery Regiment based in Kanazawa; however, he found that military life was not to his liking, so he transferred to Hosei University.Who's Who in China 3rd ed., p.809 wrote Wang Yitang went to Japan just before the Xinhai Revolution. But it was a mistake. He returned to China in 1907. After that he successively held the positions of Director of the Department for Military Affairs (), Military Counselor to the office for the Viceroy of Three Northeast Provinces (on that time, the Viceroy was Xu Shichang), Commander of the 1st Brigade of the Jilin Army () and Councilor to the Training Office of the Jilin. From 1909 he visited the Empire of Russia and the United States as a military attach√©. = In the Anhui clique = After the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Wang--through the introduction of Xu Shichang --joined the secretariat of Yuan Shikai. In 1912 he successively belonged to several political parties: Minshe (), Gonghe Cujinhui (), Unity Party (Tongyidang; ) and Republican Party (Gonghedang; ). In 1913 he was elected to the National Assembly as the representative for Tibet. In May the United Party, Democratic Party (Minzhudang; ) and Republican Party merged, becoming the Progressive Party and Wang was appointed Director. In May 1914 he was appointed a member of the State Council. In August 1915 he was appointed Civil Governor of Jilin. In April 1916 he became Minister of the Interior, and held that post until the end of June. Following the death of Yuan Shikai, Wang joined Duan Qirui's Anhui clique. The next November Duan formed the New Provisional Senate (), with Wang as President. On March 8, 1918, he and Xu Shuzheng established the Anfu Club, which engaged in political works for the Anhui clique. On August 2 Wang was appointed Chairman of the House of Representatives and led the \\"Anfu Parliament\\" (). However, in July 1920 the Anhui clique was defeated by the Zhili clique in the Zhili‚ÄìAnhui War, and the Anfu Club and Anfu Parliament were dissolved. Wang fled into exile in Japan, where he remained for the next four years. In November 1924 Duan Qirui became Provisional Chief Executive () following the Beijing Coup, and Wang returned to Beijing. From November 1924 to April 1925 he was Military Governor of Anhui. He resisted the Kuomintang‚Äôs Northern Expedition; however, with the collapse of the Beiyang Government in 1928, Wang fled to the foreign settlement in Tianjin and found refuge within the protection of the Japanese Concession. = In the provisional governments = 200px In 1931 the Nationalist Government offered Wang a political settlement; later he successively held the positions of Member of the Beiping Political Affairs Readjustment Commission (), Member of the Hebei‚ÄìChahar Political Council, General Manager of the Tianjin Financial Bank (), etc. Following the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Wang Kemin established the Provisional Government of the Republic of China in December 1937. Wang Yitang successively held the positions of Executive Member of the Political Commission (), Minister for Relief, and Minister of the Interior. In March 1940 the collaborationist Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China was established by Wang Jingwei, and Wang Yitang was appointed Minister of the Examination Yuan and a member of the North China Political Council (). From June 1940 to February 1943 he served as Chairman of the North China Political Council. Following the surrender of Japan in World War II, and the subsequent collapse of the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, Wang Yitang was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's men at a hospital in Beijing on December 5, 1945.By Yu Zidao (etc.) p.1482, 1614. Xiao Dongliang, p.730 wrote he was arrested in \\"Summer, 1946\\". At first it was believed that he was seriously ill, so the authorities decided not to continue prosecution on charges of treason. However, when it was found that he was only faking illness, his trial as a hanjian resumed from September 1946.Shanghai Newspaper (‰∏äÊµ∑Êñ∞ËÅûÂ†±), September 8th 1946. (from Yu (etc.) p.1482) He was sentenced to death by Hebei High Court, and again by the Nanjing Capital High Court.

Mohammad Mostafaei () is an Iranian human rights lawyer specializing in death penalty cases, particularly those with juvenile defendants and other human rights cases. In 2010, he moved to Norway, having left Iran due to alleged persecution by authorities for his defense of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani.  Background  Mostafaei remembered his childhood as difficult due to his family's poverty and his father's extreme mood swings. At the age of 14, he attended a public hanging of \\"a very young man\\" and was profoundly disturbed by the sight, an incident he later credited with his decision to study law. Mostafaei is married to Fereshteh Halimi. They have two daughters.  Legal work  Mostafaei states that he appealed forty death sentences of juvenile defendants during his work in Iran, of which eighteen were overturned. Four of his clients were executed in 2008 and 2009. Mostafaei became widely known for his work on human rights cases specially on death penalty and stoning cases in Iran and defense of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a woman condemned to death by stoning for adultery. He wrote a series of blog posts on her case, attracting international attention and protest. The stoning sentence was commuted in July 2010 in the face of world pressure. During the case, Mostafaei's wife, father- in-law, and brother-in-law were imprisoned in what Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty described as \\"an apparent attempt to pressure him to back down.\\" Mostafaei then illegally crossed the border into Turkey and sought asylum in Norway. The Norwegian government granted the asylum, Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store calling Mostafaei \\"a courageous man who raises cases -- difficult cases -- which the authorities don't like\\". A Mostafaei stated that though the case had forced him to leave Iran, he felt he had made the right choice: \\"I had a nice house, a good job, nice office, a good car. Iran was my home but it was not important.\\" He continued to work on human rights issues in Norway, describing himself as \\"maybe 10 times more [active]\\" than he had been in Iran. In 2011, Norwegian PEN awarded Mostafaei its Ossietsky prize, an \\"annual prize for outstanding achievements in the field of free expression\\". In 2012 Mohammad Mostafaei, established Universal Tolerance Organization (UTO) in Norway.

The games were played from October 1 to 3, 1962, between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants. The Giants won the series, two games to one. The first game took place at Candlestick Park and the second and third were played at Dodger Stadium. The playoff series was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win‚Äìloss records of 101‚Äì61. The Dodgers won a coin flip late in the season, which gave them home field advantage for the series. The Giants won the first game in an 8‚Äì0 shutout by starting pitcher Billy Pierce over Sandy Koufax. The Dodgers evened the series with an 8‚Äì7 victory in Game 2, breaking their 35-inning scoreless streak in what was then the longest nine- inning game in MLB history. However, the Giants closed out the series in Game 3 with a 6‚Äì4 victory to clinch the NL pennant. This victory advanced the Giants to the 1962 World Series in which the defending champion New York Yankees defeated them in seven games. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker series counted as the 163rd, 164th, and 165th regular-season games for both teams, with all events in the series added to regular-season statistics. The 1962 series was the fourth tie-breaker playoff in the National League's 87 years of operation, with all four happening within 17 years, with the previous series have followed the 1946, 1951 and 1959 seasons. Moreover, all four involved the Dodgers' franchise, which won one of those series (1959's) and lost the other three. It was the last MLB tie-breaker to use a best-of-three games format, as the NL subsequently adopted the single-game style used in the American League (AL). Background The Dodgers and the Giants finished the 1961 season second and third respectively in the NL, with records of 89‚Äì65 and 85‚Äì69. In an offseason trade with the Chicago White Sox the Giants acquired Billy Pierce and Don Larsen for Bob Farley, Eddie Fisher, Dom Zanni, and Verle Tiefenthaler. The Dodgers moved to a new home field, Dodger Stadium, for the 1962 season. The Giants opened the 1962 season by establishing an early lead and, though they fell back by mid-April, held at least a share of that lead continuously from April 28 to June 7. At that point the Dodgers overtook the Giants, and for the next month the lead was traded between the two sides five times. The Giants held the lead for the last time on July 7. The Dodgers went 20‚Äì6 in July while the Giants went 16‚Äì11, allowing the Dodgers to take the league lead on July 8 and hold it until season's last regular game. The Los Angeles Times described the Dodgers' season as a \\"gamut of sublime\\" and \\"ridiculous\\", noting their successes‚Äîsuch as Maury Wills' 100 stolen bases breaking Ty Cobb's single-season record, Don Drysdale's 25 wins, and Sandy Koufax's no-hitter on June 30‚Äîtogether with problems such as the 18 unearned runs the defense had allowed for the season behind Drysdale, and other fielding issues. The Dodgers lost 10 of their final 13 games from September 16 to 30, while the Giants lost just 6 over the same span. However, with seven games remaining the Dodgers were still ahead in the league by four games, and held a two-game lead with three left to play. They entered their final game with a one-game lead over the Giants, but fell 1‚Äì0 to the St. Louis Cardinals. Meanwhile, the Giants won 2‚Äì1 over the Houston Colt .45's, after an eighth- inning home run by Willie Mays. These results left the Dodgers and Giants tied in the league at 101‚Äì61, necessitating a tie-breaker to decide the NL pennant. The two teams had also played closely against one another during the regular season to this point, with each winning 9 of their 18 match-ups prior to the tie-breaker. Dodgers' manager Walt Alston and Giants' manager Alvin Dark could not agree on dates and sites for the tie-breaker, so they flipped a coin to decide home field advantage. Alston won the flip, opting to play the first game in San Francisco and the remaining two games in Los Angeles. The Dodgers had been more successful at home in the season, holding a 53‚Äì28 (.654 winning percentage) record there while going 47‚Äì34 (.580) on the road. Alston had also won the flip for the 1959 tie-breaker, which the Dodgers had gone on to win, and had chosen the same format. Game 1 summary alt=A man in a white baseball jersey and dark baseball cap smiles. Sandy Koufax had missed two months of the season, not starting from July 17 until September 21. He started three games in his return prior to the tie-breaker, losing all three and pitching just seven-and-two-thirds innings across the three starts. The night before the first game of the tiebreaker, Walt Alston asked Koufax to start the game, as Don Drysdale and Johnny Podres, the Dodgers' two front line starting pitchers, had pitched the prior two days; Koufax agreed. In the game the Giants were the first to score, on a double by Felipe Alou in the bottom of the first inning, followed by a home run by Willie Mays to make the score 2‚Äì0. Billy Pierce quickly retired three Dodgers in order for the second consecutive inning and the Giants continued to hit in the bottom of the second inning. Jim Davenport led off the inning with a home run to make the score 3‚Äì0 and Ed Bailey followed with a single. Koufax was then relieved by Ed Roebuck, having allowed three runs in the game without recording an out in the second inning. Roebuck recorded three straight outs to end the inning without further scoring. The Dodgers and the Giants each managed a single in their halves of the third inning. Neither Pierce nor Roebuck allowed a baserunner in the fourth or fifth innings, though the Giants further added to their lead in the sixth. The Dodgers pinch hit for Roebuck to lead off the top of the inning with Ken McMullen and although he singled he did not score. Larry Sherry entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning and after recording the first out he allowed back-to-back home runs to Mays and Orlando Cepeda to give the Giants a 5‚Äì0 lead. Davenport then singled and Sherry was relieved by Jack Smith who finished the inning without further damage. The game continued without scoring until the eighth inning. The Dodgers managed to get their second runner in scoring position as Doug Camilli pinch hit for Smith, but they did not score. Phil Ortega entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the eighth and the Giants continued their offensive performance. Willie Mays walked to open the inning and then stole second base with one out. Davenport and Bailey both walked to load the bases and Jos√© Pag√°n doubled to empty the bases and make the game 8‚Äì0. Pierce remained in the game to pitch the ninth, finishing his complete game shutout. Koufax later said of his Game 1 performance, \\"I had nothing at all.\\" Game 2 summary Ron Fairly, seen here with the alt=A man in a blue warm-up jacket and red, white, and blue baseball cap looks at the camera. A person with brown hair stands in the right-hand foreground. The Giants scored first for the second consecutive game, as Orlando Cepeda singled with one out in the second inning and scored on a double by Felipe Alou against Dodgers' starter Don Drysdale. The Giants then extended their lead in the top of the sixth inning. Alou struck out to open the inning but Tom Haller then walked and advanced to third base on a double by Jos√© Pag√°n. Giants' starter Jack Sanford then reached based on a throwing error by Drysdale, which also allowed Haller to score and advanced Pag√°n to third base. Chuck Hiller and Jim Davenport followed this with successive singles which scored Pag√°n and Sanford respectively. This made the score 4‚Äì0 in favor of the Giants with Hiller on second and Sanford on first, still with only one out in the inning. Ed Roebuck entered in relief of Drysdale, inducing an out at second base on a groundball by Willie Mays, to leave runners at the corners with two outs. Willie McCovey singled, allowing Hiller to score and make the game 5‚Äì0; Cepeda was then retired to end the inning. Jack Sanford had allowed just four baserunners through his first five innings, only one of whom reached scoring position. However, after he walked Jim Gilliam to open the bottom of the sixth inning, Giants' manager Alvin Dark double switched to bring Stu Miller in to relieve Sanford, and replaced McCovey in left field with Matty Alou. After the game Dark explained his decision to remove his thus far successful pitcher: \\"Sanford was suffering from a cold and he was pooped.\\" Duke Snider doubled, advancing Gilliam to third. Tommy Davis then hit a sacrifice fly, scoring Gilliam and advancing Snider. This run made the game 5‚Äì1 and ended what had been a 35 consecutive scoreless inning stretch by the Dodgers. The Dodgers increased their score as Wally Moon walked and Frank Howard singled, to bring Snider home and make the game 5‚Äì2. Billy O'Dell relieved Miller and Doug Camilli, who was pinch hitting for John Roseboro, singled to load the bases. Andy Carey then pinch hit for Willie Davis and was hit by a pitch to score Moon. The Dodgers continued substituting players, pinch hitting Lee Walls for Roebuck and bringing in Larry Burright to pinch run for Carey. Walls then hit a double which emptied the bases, giving the Dodgers a 6‚Äì5 lead in the game, and advanced to third base on the throw. Walls' double continued his success as a pinch hitter, making him 13-for-26 with 12 runs batted in in such situations for the season. Don Larsen entered to relieve O'Dell, who had not recorded an out but had earned a blown save for his performance. Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman, who threw home in an attempt to put out Walls who slid hard into the Giants' catcher Haller. The slide, which cut Haller's arm deep enough to later require six stitches, caused him to drop the ball, leaving Walls safe on Haller's error and extending the Dodgers' lead to 7‚Äì5. John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller. Wills then stole second, his 101st stolen base of the season, before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch. Orsino's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field. Wills attempted to advance to third, but was thrown out by Willie Mays. Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over. Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers, three pinch hitters, two defensive replacements, and a pinch runner. Ron Perranoski entered as the new pitcher for the seventh, Camilli took his place as the new catcher, and Ron Fairly replaced Wally Moon at first base. Burright became the new second baseman, replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman, Tommy Davis, moved to center field. Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pag√°n after a ground out by Felipe Alou. The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller, but both recorded outs to end the top of the seventh. Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants in the bottom of the inning and no runs scored in the frame. The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth, with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning. Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single to Ed Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers' lead to 7‚Äì6. Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out. The play drew arguments from Mays, Alvin Dark, and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out. Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey, and Cepeda reached on an error on his fly ball which allowed Boles to move to third. Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases. Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pag√°n grounded out to end the inning. Bobby Bolin entered as the new pitcher for the Giants in the bottom of the eighth. Bolin kept the game tied, as did Williams who pitched a perfect top of the ninth inning. Wills walked to leadoff the bottom of the ninth, however, and Dick LeMay relieved Bolin. Gilliam then also walked, advancing Wills to second. The Dodgers announced Daryl Spencer as a pinch hitter for Snider and the Giants countered by bringing Gaylord Perry in relief of LeMay. Spencer laid down a successful sacrifice bunt, advancing the two runners to second and third base. The play drew comment after the game, as some writers believed Perry had a chance to throw to third base to put out the lead runner Wills. Alvin Dark had given Perry instructions to throw to 3rd if a bunt was made. He threw to first instead, allowing the sacrifice. Alvin Dark angrily went to the mound, and Mike McCormick relieved Perry, intentionally walked Tommy Davis, and then allowed a game-winning walk-off sacrifice fly to Fairly driving in Wills. Game 2 lasted 4 hours and 18 minutes, breaking the previous record of 4 hours and 2 minutes for the longest 9-inning game in major league history. Coincidentally Wills, who scored the winning run, celebrated his 30th birthday on the same day as Game 2. Game 3 summary alt=A man wearing a vanilla- colored jacket, with a white collared dress shirt and a black scarf around his neck Game 3 matched the Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had considered starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring in the top of the third. Jos√© Pag√°n singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pag√°n to move to third, and Pag√°n scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance to third. Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base. Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2‚Äì0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went to third, and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out, and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning. The Dodgers cut into the lead in the fourth, as Snider doubled to lead off, advanced to third on a Tommy Davis single, and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard. The Giants threatened against Podres in the top of the sixth with singles by Cepeda, Ed Bailey, and Jim Davenport on a bunt to load the bases. However, Ed Roebuck relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers took a 3‚Äì2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored on a home run by Tommy Davis. They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning, but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him. This extended the Dodgers' lead to 4‚Äì2. The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth. Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis' at bat but Davis walked to lead off the inning regardless. Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out. However, Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to load the bases and induced a ground out by Roebuck to end the inning. The Giants took the decisive lead in the top of the ninth inning. Matty Alou pinch hit for Larsen and singled to lead off the inning and Kuenn grounded into a force out at second base. Willie McCovey pinch hit for Hiller and walked to advance Kuenn. Ernie Bowman pinch ran for McCovey and Felipe Alou walked to load the bases. Mays hit a line drive single scoring Kuenn. Roebuck barely managed to knock the ball down to hold Mays to a single and Mays said he was \\"still mad\\" after the game because he had expected more off of the hit. Stan Williams relieved Roebuck and Cepeda hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at 4‚Äì4 and advance Alou to third. Mays moved to second on a wild pitch to Bailey and Williams intentionally walked him to reload the bases. Williams walked Davenport to give the Giants a 5‚Äì4 lead, and they added to it as Pag√°n reached on an error by second baseman Larry Burright allowing Mays to score and extend the lead to 6‚Äì4. Billy Pierce pitched a perfect bottom of the ninth to end the game, earning his only save of the season. Had the Dodgers not yielded the lead in the final inning they instead would have earned a postseason berth, their first since winning the pennant via a tie-breaker in 1959. Aftermath alt=The face of a dark-skinned man who is smiling widely. The letters \\"S\\" and \\"F\\" overlap on his hat. The Giants' win earned the franchise its 17th playoff berth, the first since moving to San Francisco from New York City in 1958. In the playoffs they faced the New York Yankees in the 1962 World Series which they lost in seven games, ending the Giants' season. They returned to the playoffs in 1971 and the World Series in 1989 and 2002. In 2010, the Giants won their first World Series since moving to San Francisco. The Dodgers returned to the World Series in 1963 and swept the Yankees. The Dodgers set a new attendance record in 1962, topping the previous mark of 2,641,845 set by the Cleveland Indians in 1948 with a total of 2,755,184 fans. Game 2 was the longest nine-inning game in MLB history with a time of 4 hours and 18 minutes, a record which stood until April 30, 1996, when a game between the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles lasted 4 hours and 21 minutes. The record was again broken on August 18, 2006, during a game in which the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox 14‚Äì11 in 4 hours and 45 minutes. In baseball statistics tie-breakers count as regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, Willie Mays extended his league-leading home run total to 49 and Maury Wills raised his record-breaking stolen base total from 100 to 104, the most since 1900. Additionally Wills, Jos√© Pag√°n, and Tommy Davis played in 165, 164, and 163 games respectively, totals which could not have been matched by players not on the Dodgers or Giants. Wills also won the NL Most Valuable Player Award narrowly over Mays, with Davis placing third in the voting. Don Drysdale won both the Cy Young and Sporting News Pitcher of the Year awards and Jim Davenport, Wills, and Mays each won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards. MLB played two All-Star Games in 1962. Four Dodgers and five Giants were named to the first while four Dodgers and four Giants played in the second. Five future Hall of Famers were on the Giants roster in 1962 (Cepeda, Marichal, Mays, McCovey, and Perry) while the Dodgers had three (Drysdale, Koufax, and Snider). Dodgers' manager Walt Alston was also inducted to the Hall as a manager in 1983. Additionally, this 1962 series was the last MLB tie-breaker to use the best-of-three games format. The AL had always used a one-game format and all future NL tie-breakers were played in that format as well.

It is located in the town of Wundanyi, Taita- Taveta County. Facilities Services offered include Antenatal Care, Basic Emergency Obstetric Care, Curative In-patient Services, HIV Counselling and Testing, Immunization, Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, Prevention of Mother to Child transmission of HIV, Radiology Services e.g. X-ray and Tuberculosis Treatment. Disputes In August 2009, disputes between the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Medical Services had affected medical services in the hospital. The district development committee (DDC) was having difficulties making crucial decisions as the Ministry of Medical Services and that of Public Health and Sanitation were entangled in the row. The Taita-Taveta District Public Health and Sanitation officer Shem Patta had a difficult time explaining the fate of Wesu District Hospital in Wundanyi after it was said to be understaffed and ill-equipped. Speaking during a DDC meeting in Wundanyi, Dr Patta said he was not able to comment on the status of the hospital. His counterpart in the Medical Services ministry was better placed to discuss the issue, he said. Although he was in charge before the Ministry of health was split into two, he said, he had scant information about the hospital, which the area MP Thomas Mwadeghu said was being neglected by the government. Earlier that year, there was a report that ants had infested the hospital's mortuary. Quoting a distressed resident, who claimed the ants had bitten the body of a relative and dug holes in it, as an example of the neglect in public hospitals. Further, the cooling facility at the hospital had broken down, meaning bodies couldn't be preserved. Wesu had earlier been downgraded from a district hospital, putting a strain on its facilities. Although it was not expected that the ministries of Medical Services and Public Health and Sanitation would immediately fix the system that has been going downhill for decades, letting hospitals slip to the level of Wesu is unacceptable. Only radical surgery would solve such problems. Location The hospital is located on the southern part of Kenya in Coast Province. The hospital is located 7 km away from the district headquarters, Wundanyi town, accessed by a long meandering earth road. The main mode of transport to the hospital is by motorcycle. The hospital lies on of land whose title is held by the county council of Taita-Taveta. There are three governmental district hospitals in Taita-Taveta district. One is located in Taveta, one in Wesu, and one in Voi. Demographics of served population Most of the women in Mwatunge give birth at home, while women of Voi do it in the hospital. In Mwanda, most of the women have home births, but a few had delivered in the close-by Wesu hospital. In the Taita-Taveta district, population growth is well below national and provincial averages. Reasons for this are seen to be higher education level of girls, which is then reflected in lower fertility rates. Out-migration also contributes to this, as educated and uneducated young people move to bigger cities to look for work. With future advances in health care and family planning, Taita Hills and Taita- Taveta might very well become a good example of sustainable population development. The fact remains, however, that the uphill area of Taita Hills is already densely populated., , 148 pp. Component sub-units and equipment The hospital complex consists of: *An Outpatient block with pharmacy, consultation rooms, injection room, MCH/FP clinic, Child Welfare Clinic, Mental Health Clinic, dental room, Comprehensive Care Clinic(C.C.C.) and records building‚Äîthe latter has not been occupied as it is incomplete and needs to be redesigned. *An administration block with Accounts/N.H.I.F. office, Health Administrative Office, Medical Superintendent Office, Nursing Officer in-charge office, Telephone Operator Office, Personnel office, Computer Room, and Board Room. This block is one of the old buildings earmarked for rehabilitation upon availability of development funds. *Medical Engineering Services Department (MESD) block with workshop‚Äîan old building for rehabilitation. *Supplies department block with non-pharmaceuticals stores, bulk drug stores and supplies office; old building for rehabilitation. *An X-Ray Unit; recently renovated in 2006. *An ultramodern theatre complex recently renovated in 2006. *A Maternity Unit with labour ward and neonatal unit; recently renovated in 2006. *A Laboratory and Physiotherapy block. *A Kitchen and Laundry Block. *An Occupational Therapy block which is the oldest building in the institution built in 1954 as the first maternity unit. It needs to be rehabilitated and then better utilised with many free rooms. *Wards which include 2 general wards (male and female/paediatrics) and isolation ward which is unoccupied. *A Mortuary block which is located in the far southern end of the hospital accessed from the hospital entrance. *Other buildings are staff house quarters which are under the Ministry of Housing and also local government housing units. A majority are occupied but are not in a well maintained state. There is need for the hospital management to plan for renovating them. The hospital is not fully equipped as per the K.E.P.H. (Kenya Essential Package for Health) standards for offering of essential medical services. There is a 65KVA generator, donated by PLAN International, which broke down in early 2009. There has been a concerted effort to try and repair it but the pace is slow and funding is unavailable. The mortuary coolers, 4 in number, are in good working condition after being renovated recently in July 2009. The institution has 2 hospital vehicles donated by the Danish international development agency (DANIDA) that are serviceable and in good working order. They include an ambulance Land Cruiser and a double-cabin pick- up vehicle. Overall the performance rating for the hospital is average; however, there is a lot of room for improvement.

He played college football at South Carolina State University. Early years King attended Columbia High School. He accepted a football scholarship from the South Carolina State University. He was named a starter at linebacker midway through his freshman season, and was a part of the 1977 team that was awarded the National Black Championship by the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper. King was a four-year starter that received All-MEAC honors in 1979 and 1980. He also received honorable-mention Little All-American honors in 1980. As a senior, he blocked a school record 4 punts (6 in his career). In 2007, he was named to the South Carolina State Centennial Football Team. In 2012, he was inducted into the South Carolina State Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= King was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1981 NFL Draft. He was waived on August 3. He was re-signed and released again on August 25. On September 8, he was re-signed after linebacker Mike Hegman fractured his arm in the season opener against the Washington Redskins. He played mainly on special teams and remained on the roster after Hegman returned. He was mainly a nickel linebacker and special teams player for three seasons. On August 27, 1984, he was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for a sixth round draft choice (#151-Stan Gelbaugh). =Detroit Lions= King was a part-time starter and special teams player for the Detroit Lions in his first season with the team. In 1985, the team changed to a 3-4 defense and although he was assigned the role of nickel linebacker, he eventually started 9 games after Michael Cofer was lost for the year and posted career-highs with 90 tackles (77 solo) and 4 sacks. The next year, he missed 5 games with an ankle injury (4 weeks spent on the injured reserve list). After Jimmy Williams was lost for the year, he started the last 4 games at strongside linebacker and finished with 23 tackles. He was cut on September 6, 1987. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players.

The object is a featured item at the National Museum of Iceland. The statue may depict the Norse god Thor and/or may be a gaming-piece. The statue was unearthed in 1815 or 1816 on one of two farms called Eyrarland in the vicinity of Akureyri.

He studied at Harvard University where he was awarded the A.B. (magna cum laude) in chemistry in 1909 and a doctorate in 1912. Until 1921 he was a member of the research staff of General Electric and then of Arthur D. Little. There with Little and Wallace Murray he contrived to make a 'silk' purse from reconstituted collagen extracted from a sow's ear. In 1930 he founded Gustavus J. Esselen, Inc., which following a merger, became Esselen Research Division of United States Testing Co., Inc. Among the successful projects for industrial clients he was involved with was the development of anhydride curing agents for epoxy resins and polyvinyl butyral as an improved material for the subsequent commercialization of laminated glass for use in vehicles etc. More than 40 U.S. patents were issued as a result of his research efforts. He was a member of the American Chemical Society for 43 years, twice chairman of the Northeastern Section (1922‚Äì23) and served as councilor and director of the national organization. From 1919 to 1951 he was chairman of the American Section of the Society of Chemical Industry. Prior to World War II he was a reserve officer in the U.S. Army's Chemical Warfare Service. During the war he was a committee chairman with the Office of Scientific Research and Development.  Esselen Award  In 1987, the Esselen Award was established in his honor. The Esselen Award for Chemistry in the public interest is one of the most prestigious honors provided by the Northeastern Section of the ACS. The award of $5,000 annually recognizes > a chemist whose scientific and technical work has contributed to the public > well-being, and has thereby communicated positive values of the chemical > profession. Notable recipients include F. Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina, Bruce Ames, Kyriacos C. Nicolaou, Robert S. Langer, Joseph M. DeSimone, Jean Fr√©chet, Ronald Breslow and Bruce Roth.

Life Second son of Samuel Croft, he was born at Beamsley, a hamlet in the chapelry of Bolton Abbey, Skipton, West Riding of Yorkshire, and baptised on 27 March 1747. Although his father was in humble circumstances, Croft was educated at the grammar school of Bolton Abbey, under the Rev. Thomas Carr. Carr taught Croft without fee, and solicited subscriptions from well-to-do friends and neighbours in order to send him to university. Admitted as a servitor of University College, Oxford, on 23 October 1762, he was chosen bible clerk on the following 6 December, and in 1768, the first year of its institution, he gained the chancellor's prize for an English essay upon the subject of Artes prosunt reipublic√¶. He graduated B.A. on 16 February 1768, proceeding M.A. on 2 June 1769. Meanwhile, he had been appointed master of Beverley Grammar School on 6 December 1768; and, having been ordained, was elected as a Fellow of University College on 16 July 1779. On 11 December 1779 he was instituted by his college to the vicarage of Arncliffe in the West Riding, and on 19 and 21 January 1780 took the two degrees (B.D. and D.D.) in divinity. About this time he became chaplain to the Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin. He left Beverley at Michaelmas 1780, on being named headmaster of Brewood Grammar School, Staffordshire, a post he resigned in 1791 to accept the lectureship of St. Martin's, Birmingham, to which was later added the chaplaincy of St. Bartholomew in the same parish. He took a particularly strong polemical line in preaching against local Dissenters, who from 1780 included Joseph Priestley. On 12 October 1780, Croft married Ann, daughter of William Grimston of Ripon, by whom he had a son and six daughters. In 1786, Croft was invited to give the Bampton Lectures. From his old college friend John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon, he received in 1802 the rectory of Thwing in the East Riding, which he was allowed to hold, by a dispensation, with the vicarage of Arncliffe. He died in Birmingham on 11 May 1809, aged 62, and was buried in the north aisle of St. Martin's Church, Birmingham, where there is a monument to his memory.

It was built in the late twelfth century and has been remodelled several times in the succeeding centuries. History 260px The church was probably built in the 1180s as the first rector was installed in 1189. It was refurbished by Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford in 1485‚Äì95 and again in 1825‚Äì27 by the rector Rev. Robert Knight who added the vestry and altered the stone pulpit. The building was restored by John Prichard and John Pollard Seddon in 1860‚Äì61 and an organ chamber was added in 1885. More restoration work in 1903 and 1927 included reflooring the nave, reroofing the porch and installing oak stalls in the chancel. A meeting room and vestry wing were added in 1993. Description The plan of the building is a tower in the west, nave, south porch, chancel, north-eastern chapel and northern wing. The church is built of roughly coursed grey rubble with grey or yellow ashlar dressings and has a slate roof with stone apex finials. The large and defensive west tower has wide-angle buttresses at each corner and a saddleback roof with embattled and corbelled parapets only on the northern and southern sides. The stone-tiled coping is topped by a weathervane. The northern and southern faces of the tower have four storeys of small round or square openings, although one on the south face is trefoil headed. The eastern facade has large shouldered openings above a corbel table that probably supported a wooden platform. The western side of the tower has a face corbel, reputedly of Saint John the Baptist, above a louvred gable opening, a clock and a three-light window above the ornate western doorway.

Theseus and Ariadne Plutarch recounts a story he attributes to Paeon concerning Theseus and Ariadne. Theseus and Ariadne were driven off course by a storm and onto the island of Cyprus. Theseus put Ariadne, who was pregnant and in great distress from the motion of the ship, ashore alone but was himself swept out to sea again. The Cyprian women cared for Ariadne, comforting her in her loneliness, giving letters to Ariadne, which they had written, saying the letters had come from Theseus. But Ariadne died in childbirth. When Theseus returned, greatly distraught, he gave the island money, asking them to make sacrifices to Ariadne, and had two small statuettes, one silver, one bronze, set up in her honor. According to Plutarch, Paeon says that at the sacrifices made in Ariadne's honor on the second day of the month Gorpiaes, a young man lies down and imitates the cries and gestures of a woman in the pains of labor and that they call the place where the sacrifices were held the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite.Plutarch, Theseus 20 Bearded Aphrodite Paeon of Amathus, quoted by Theophrastus, who said that the Cypriot goddess could take the shape of a man. Macrobius describes the statue of Venus in Cyprus as being bearded and having male genitals, but clad in female dress and holding a scepter. Aristophanes knew of the existence of this androgynous deity called Aphroditos. Hesychius confirmed that Aphroditos was a hermaphrodite.Parpola , p. 278; Hill p. 79; Ellis, p. 410; Harris, p. 360.

While beliefs about the physical appearance of the Vazimba reflect regional variation, they are generally described as smaller in stature than the average person, leading some scientists to speculate that they may have been a pygmy people (and therefore a separate Malagasy ethnic group) who migrated from the islands that constitute modern-day Indonesia and settled in Madagascar over the course of the period between 350 BCE-500 CE. Scientific evidence confirms the first arrival and subsequent increase of human settlers on the island during this period, but the pygmy theory has not been proven. Stories about the Vazimba form a significant element in the cultural history and collective identity of the Malagasy people, ranging from the historical to the supernatural, inspiring diverse beliefs and practices across the island. They have analogs in some other Austronesian cultures, including the Menehunes in Hawaii. History =First settlers of Madagascar= The facts surrounding the initial settling of Madagascar by oceanic explorers from the region of modern-day Indonesia, including the precise timing and nature of this colonization, remain a subject of ongoing debate and study. It has been theorized that there may have been successive waves of early settlement in Madagascar. According to this theory, the waves originated from the same region of southeast Asia, spoke the same language and shared the same culture. When the second wave arrived, they found the island sparsely populated by descendants of the first wave whose culture and way of life had evolved from relatively primitive roots, reflecting centuries of adaptation to local surroundings in total isolation from outside threats. According to popular belief, the Vazimba did not possess knowledge of metallurgy or rice farming and used weapons made of clay. After Bantu-speaking settlers from East Africa migrated to the island and brought their culture of zebu cattle herding with them, the Vazimba were said to have herded their zebu without eating them for meat. If the multi-wave settlement theory is correct, the indigenous (first-wave) population that the more technologically advanced second-wave settlers would have encountered upon arrival in Madagascar would provide the historic basis for stories of the primitive nature of the Vazimba societies they are said to have encountered there.\\"Vazimba: Mythe ou Realit√©?\\" Razafimahazo, S. Revue de l‚ÄôOc√©an Indien. Accessed on November 8, 2010. Archaeological research and oral histories have provided some indication of how these early inhabitants of the highlands might have lived.Kent, Raymond K. Early Kingdoms in Madagascar: 1500-1700\\\\. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970. Upon their arrival in those ancient tropical highland forests, the Vazimba practiced tavy (swidden, slash-and-burn agriculture) to clear the land for cultivating bananas, tubers, ginger and other staples. They gathered honey, fruits and edible seeds and hunted small game in the forests. As their population increased, villages were established and ruled by chiefs and later kings. Rulers are believed to have reddened their hair using a local mushroom; the association of the color red with royalty is found in many parts of Madagascar to this day. Oral history classifies the Vazimba according to the parts of the island where they are believed to have settled.\\"Origine Confuse des Vazimba du Betsiriry.\\" Ravalitera, P. Journal Express. Accessed on November 11, 2010. The vazimba andrano (\\"Vazimba of the Water\\") settled along rivers and lakes. The vazimba antety (\\"Vazimba of the Soil\\") were believed to be the most numerous and were reportedly clustered around the valley of Betsiriry in the central Highlands. The vazimba antsingy (\\"Vazimba of the Tsingy\\") lived in the caves around the limestone formations (tsingy) of Bemaraha in western Madagascar and were believed to scavenge fruit and other forest products to live. =Historic rise and decline= The first period of Malagasy oral history is known as the Vazimba period (faha vazimba), beginning with the initial population of the island by the Vazimba and their establishment of kingdoms - often ruled by Queens - in the central Highlands region of Madagascar.Bloch, M. From blessing to violence: History and ideology in the circumcision ritual of the Merina in Madagascar. Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1986. According to some accounts,Callet, F. Tantara ny andriana eto Madagascar. Acad√©mie Malgache, 1908. the first Vazimba sovereign of the central highlands was named Andriandravindravina. The second period in the oral history of the Highlands begins with the conquest of the Vazimba Highland kingdoms by Merina sovereigns in what would come to be known as Imerina in their honor. Andriamanelo (1540-1575) - who was himself half- Vazimba through his antecedents Queen Rangita and Queen Rafohy - is credited (along with his successors, Ralambo and Andrianjaka) with successfully forcing the Vazimba out of the Highlands and into the western part of the island. It is commonly believed that the last of the Vazimba were annihilated during the reign of Andrianjaka (1610-1630). However, dismissing the stories of distinctive Vazimba physical appearance, Jean-Pierre Domenichini has theorized that the term Vazimba may have been more of a statement of cultural than ethnic difference and that many who had been considered Vazimba in this period did not die out, but instead may have simply chosen to become assimilated into the vanquishing Merina culture.\\"Antehiroka et Royaut√© Vazimba.\\" Domenichini, J.P. Express de Madagascar. Accessed on November 5, 2010. The oral history of many Merina and Betsileo families speaks of intermarriage between Merina and Vazimba ancestors, and some Malagasy speculate that the hunter-gatherer Mikea peoples and the Vezo fishing tribe, both concentrated along the coastline of western and southern Madagascar, may be descended from Vazimba. In the popular imagination There are many legends and stories in Malagasy oral history relating to important Vazimba figures. For instance, oral history tells of a Vazimba woman named Ramboamana and a Vazimba man named Ramboabesofy, known as tompon-tany (masters of the land) - the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar, who settled in the region of Ankavandra. The couple had two sons named Rangoromana and Zafihisoky whom legend credits as the first to bring zebu to the island. Some Merina trace their genealogy back to a man named Ndrenavoavo or his sister Pelamana who, according to oral history, were the very first non-Vazimba people (i.e. second-wave settlers) to arrive in Madagascar. They are believed to be buried in a forest near Tsirendresaka. It is said that their tomb was venerated by all the Vazimba of Betsiriry, and in return, the people of Tsirendresaka observe a fady (taboo) that forbids the killing of zebu, in homage to the Vazimba and their tradition of herding cattle without consuming them. In Madagascar today, popular belief maintains that the Vazimba may not have been human at all, but rather a sort of monster or often malevolent spirit that haunts natural sites such as rivers, boulders or gorges. Oral history maintains that it was customary among Vazimba to submerge their dead in designated bogs or other waters and these areas are held sacred, sometimes becoming sites of pilgrimage and sacrifice. The Vazimba are often envisioned as being smaller than the average person, either quite pale or very dark. The more monstrous descriptions of Vazimba speak of an unnaturally elongated face with large lips concealing fang-like teeth. Among the many beliefs related to the Vazimba, it is said they cannot stand to touch any object that has made contact with salt, and it is forbidden to bring garlic or pork into an area believed to contain a Vazimba tomb.

Though considered a little brown mushroom of unknown edibility, it is distinctive because of its thick covering of coarse hairs, and differentiated from other members of Crinipellis by its slightly larger cap size, which reaches up to in diameter. The white gills on the underside of the cap are crowded closely together, and are free from attachment to the stem. Saprobic, it grows on the dead wood of deciduous trees from late summer to autumn. The fungus is found commonly in eastern North America, but has also been collected in Portugal and Korea. The variety C. zonata var. cremoricolor, found in eastern North America, may be distinguished microscopically by its longer spores. Taxonomy and classification The species was first named as Agaricus zonatus by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1872, based on specimens found near Albany, New York. He later transferred it to the genus Collybia in 1896. It was given its current name by the Italian botanist Pier Andrea Saccardo. Crinipellis zonata is classified in subsection Crinipellis of section Crinipellis in the genus Crinipellis, according to Rolf Singer's 1986 arrangement of the Agaricales. Species in this subsection have elongated spores, and typically lack cystidia on the sides of gills. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis of several Crinipellis and Moniliophthora species (Moniliophthora are anamorphic fungi parasitic on cocoa and previously included in Crinipellis) demonstrated that C. zonata formed a clade with C. rhizomaticola, C. scabella, and C. nigricaulis. The conclusions of this analysis, based on the DNA sequences of ribosomal DNA coding for internal transcribed spacers, are inconsistent with the morphology-based classification given by Singer. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"zoned Crinipellis\\" or the \\"zoned-cap Collybia\\". Description Fruit bodies can grow in small clusters on decaying hardwood. Crinipellis zonata is a little brown mushroom with a cap of in diameter, which is convex (sometimes approaching flat) in shape. Typically, it has a small, distinctive depression in the centre, while the whole cap is densely hairy and dry. There are often concentric zones of both color and texture. The cap is tawny or cream, while the hairs (which are set in lines) are tawny. The white gills are close and narrow, and free or nearly free from the stem. The gills do not discolor. The stem is between in height, by thick. Like the cap, it is densely covered in tawny hairs. Although the stem is hollow, the cap has an insubstantial layer of white flesh. The spore print is white, and the smooth, elliptical spores are 4‚Äì6 by 3‚Äì5 ¬µm in size. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 25‚Äì30 by 6.0‚Äì6.5 ¬µm. C. zonata has basidioles‚Äîbasidium-like cells in the hymenium that lack the slender projections known as sterigmata that attach to spores. The basidioles are 15‚Äì28 by 3.0‚Äì8.0 ¬µm, and range in shape from club-shaped to cylindrical to fusoid (fuse-like). The cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the edges of gills) are 20‚Äì45 by 5.0‚Äì9.0 ¬µm, cylindrical, club-shaped or fusoid, irregular, and branched or coral-like. Pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are absent. The \\"hairs\\" on the cap surface are about 50‚Äì800 by 4.0‚Äì10 ¬µm, and roughly cylindrical with an irregular base; the hairs on the stem are similar to the cap hairs. The cap and stem hairs are dextrinoid, meaning that they are stained yellowish-brown or reddish-brown by the iodine of Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are present in all tissues. =Variety cremoricolor= In 1989, Scott Redhead reduced the species Crinipellis cremoricolor (originally described by Robert L. Shaffer and Margaret G. Weaver in 1965, based on specimens found near the University of Michigan Biological Station) to a variety of C. crinipellis. The variety cremoricolor is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7‚Äì12 by 3.8‚Äì5 ¬µm. According to Shaffer and Weaver, it differs macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to buff-colored cap and stem, and pale pinkish-cinnamon gills. =Edibility= Fruit bodies of Crinipellis zonata have no distinct odor, and a mild to slightly mealy taste. Though the edibility is not known with certainty, author Roger Phillips lists the species as \\"Poisonous/Suspect\\". =Similar species= Though similar in appearance to other members of Crinipellis, such as C. stipitaria and C. piceae, C. zonata has a slightly larger cap. The Ghanaian species Crinipellis ghanaensis is also similar, but may be distinguished by its lighter-colored cap without a \\"corrugated appearance\\", and its distribution. Distribution and ecology Crinipellis zonata is saprobic, living on the debris or roots of hardwoods; it contains wood-decaying enzymes that can break down the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. The mushrooms grow individually or in small clusters, and is found between August and September. In North America, it is distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, and has been recorded as far west as Indiana and Texas. In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal. It has also been collected in South Korea.

Heuss died in March 1935 while the family was living in Syracuse, New York, and his mother moved them back to Pickens. While attending a hotel management school in Washington, D. C., she met and married Willard W. Haldeman, in 1937. Haldeman adopted the boys, changing their last name to his. The family moved a number of times as Willard Haldeman took different jobs, and lived in Maryland, New York City, and Sackets Harbor, New York (on which Haldeman later modeled the town in his second novel, The Snowman. Haldeman attended thirteen schools in eleven years.Biographical sketch on Penguin paperback edition of \\"The Snowman\\" (Penguin Book 2545) After high school, he attended Erskine College as a freshman (1948‚Äì49) and Antioch College as a sophomore(1949‚Äì50),Contemporary Authors: First revision, Volumes 5-8 (1968), p.498 and the Ringling School of Art in Sarasota, Florida.The Snowman, by Charles Haldeman on The Neglected Book Page (posted September 2, 2009; accessed August 8, 2010) He was enlisted into the US Navy in 1950 and served until 1954. After his discharge, he worked briefly in New York City, and then traveled to Europe, where he attended the University of Heidelberg between 1955 and 1957. He then moved to Athens, Greece, where he taught high school biology and algebra at the American Community Schools for two years. In 1959, he moved to Mikonos, and then to Crete, where he bought and restored a Venetian villa on the waterfront in Chania. He lived on Crete until just before his death. He became friends with Charles Henri FordDowell, James. \\"20th Century AD,\\" Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, Nov-Dec, 2001 and wrote the screenplay for Ford's film, \\"Johnny Minotaur\\" (1971).\\"Johnny Minotaur (1971) on IMDB He also developed friendships with many writers and poets of the time, not least among them Nikos Gatsos, the Greek poet and the American writer Henry Miller. Disturbing the older Miller at work, as a young writer starting out, Miller later wrote, in the Preface to his book ‚ÄúBig Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy warmest thanks go to Charles Haldeman, who came all the way from Winter Park, Florida, to put Wilhelm Fr√§nger's book on Hieronymus Bosch in my hands. May he forgive me for being such a poor host that day!‚Äù Peter Levi, the English poet and travel writer, in an interview in 1979 for the Paris Review (Fall 1979, No. 76) talks of having dinner and attempting to write surrealist poetry with both Gatsos and Haldeman: \\"Toward the end of the evening, Nikos suddenly said, ‚ÄúYou know, I remember when we were young, and Surrealism was all the rage, Elytis and I, (Elytis is another Greek poet), there was a game we used to play. Shall we play it?‚Äù The result became Levi's poem: Pancakes for the Queen of Babylon. Haldeman is remembered by many as a warm and passionate man interacting with, and often supporting, (despite his often precarious financial situation as a full-time writer) writers and artists and the many travellers he met at that crossroads that both mainland Athens and Hania, Crete, were at that time, for people searching for an answer to some of the world's dilemmas. Following his death, Levi went on to write a long and passionate lament: for Charles Haldeman, (published in Agenda, Vol. 22, Nos. 3-4, 1985) remembering their time together on the seafront in Hania: There was one caf√© on the empty quay, it could consume poetry in handfuls never distracted from the stone quayside. High overhead under the blazing sun a snowy mountain rippled like a flag. In the morning wrote letters for the whores to their true loves serving in Sicily, with eyes of blue, far clearer than the sea. Haldeman provided the lyrics for Manos Hatzidakis' title song for the 1962 film, It Happened in Athens. His screenplay for the film Nicholas was accepted by 20th Century Fox, but production was cancelled after the 1967 \\"Colonels' coup\\". He also wrote scripts for a number of British, Greek, and Canadian documentaries. From 1972 to 1974, he served as the editor for International History Magazine. At the time of his death, he and director Christopher Miles were attempting to sell the rights to a film play, The Cretan Runner, based on George Psychoundakis' memoir of the same name. He died in Athens, Greece in 1983. Works Haldeman's first novel, The Sun's Attendant, was published in England in 1963 and in the US in 1964. Its protagonist, Stefan Br√ºckmann, is a half-German, half-Gypsy boy survives Auschwitz and attends the University of Heidelberg as a young man. He becomes involved with a variety of intellectuals and expatriates and is eventually forced to confront his memories and experiences during the war. It was praised by Lawrence Durrell, who had befriended Haldeman in Greece, and George Steiner, who called it \\"a profoundly original novel.\\"The Sun's Attendant, by Charles Haldeman on The Neglected Book Page (posted December 13, 2009; accessed August 8, 2010) William Gibson's 1964 review for the Saturday Review also concluded his view of the work with the statement: \\"...how many novelists of this century have reminded men that they may be holy men?\\" His second novel, The Snowman (1965), described the odd history and relationship of the inhabitants of a fictional small upstate New York town, Joseph's Landing, in the later part of World War Two. Robert Nye wrote of it in a review for The Guardian, \\"No American novelist since Faulkner strikes me as having a finer awareness of the possibilities of language as an index to the complications of human behaviour.\\" Haldeman's third novel, Teagarden's Gang (1971) was an allegorical novel that used a story about Jake Teagarden, a chemist who discovers a quick way to make alcohol and so becomes a powerful mobster in 1920s Prohibition-era Chicago, to comment upon developments in the United States in the late 1960s. A small collection of poems - without graves - no resurrections - was published posthumously by Five Seasons Press in 1984, with an introduction by Peter Levi. Levi, who died in February 2000, a friend of Haldeman's from their days in Athens together, wrote: \\"The vivid lightning that flashed here and there in his mind was something he could never put to sleep.\\" The Paris Review (No. 30, Summer-Fall 1963) also published his short fiction Man is a Wonderful Woundable Animal.

In the film James Caan stars as Lt. Commander Richard Bolton, a Canadian, who must lead a group of midget submarines in an attack on a German battleship. Plot In 1943, a Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve officer from Canada, Commander Bolton (James Caan) and a few surviving crew members of his 50-man submarine Gauntlet swim ashore after unsuccessfully attacking German battleship Lindendorf. After a review, Captain Bolton is cleared of any wrongdoing and placed in charge of a small group of experimental X-class submarines. Bolton is assigned by Vice-Admiral Redmayne (Rupert Davies) to quickly train crews to man the submarines and sink the Lindendorf while it is hidden away in a Norwegian fjord. Commander Bolton is to train three 4-man crews along the northern coast of Scotland for a trio of midget submarines equipped with side cargoes of explosives. He must overcome tensions with some of his former crew members, while keeping their activities hidden from outsiders and German airplanes. The crews successfully fend off an attack by German parachute commandos, who discover their base. Bolton is forced to make hasty preparations for his attack before their submarine base can be destroyed. Two of the submarines are lost while attempting to cut through submarine nets at the entrance to the fjord. X-2, is sunk by a German E-boat's depth charges, and a second, the X-1, is scuttled. One submarine crew is captured and taken to the German battleship for interrogation.

In decision-making, a rank reversal is a change in the rank ordering of the preferability of alternative possible decisions when, for example, the method of choosing changes or the set of other available alternatives changes. The issue of rank reversals lies at the heart of many debates in decision-making and multi-criteria decision- making, in particular. Unlike most other computational procedures, it is hard to tell if a particular decision-making method has derived the correct answer or not. Such methods analyze a set of alternatives described in terms of some criteria. They determine which alternative is the best one, or they provide relative weights of how the alternatives perform, or just how the alternatives should be ranked when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. This is exactly where the challenge with decision making exists. Often it is hard, if not practically impossible, to determine whether a correct answer has been reached or not. With other computational methods, for instance with a job scheduling method, one can examine a set of different answers and then categorize the answers according to some metric of performance (for instance, a project's completion time). But this may not be possible to do with the answers derived by most decision making methods. After all, determining the best decision making method leads to a decision making paradox. Thus the following question emerges: How can one evaluate decision-making methods? This is a very difficult issue and may not be answered in a globally accepted manner. A critical part in answering this fundamental question is played by what is known as rank reversals.  Rank reversal  One way to test the validity of decision-making methods is to construct special test problems and then study the solutions they derive. If the solutions exhibit some logic contradictions (in the form of undesirable rank reversals of the alternatives), then one may argue that something is wrong with the method that derived them. To see the above point more clearly, suppose that three candidates are evaluated for some job opening. Let us designate these candidates as A, B, and C. Suppose that some decision making method has determined that the best candidate for that job is person A, followed by B, who is followed by C. This is the first ranking and it is indicated as follows: A > B > C (where > means better than). Next, suppose that candidate B (who is not the best one) is replaced by an even worse candidate, say person D. That is, now we have B > D, and candidate B is replaced by D while candidates A and C remain in the pool of candidates with exactly the same characteristics as before. When the new set of alternatives (i.e., candidates A, D and C) are ranked together and by assuming that the criteria have exactly the same weights as before, then should not candidate A still be the best one? It turns out that under some decision making methods the best alternative may be different now. This is known as a rank reversal and it is one of the types of rank reversals. The first type of rank reversal in the above context was observed by Belton and Gear in 1983 as part of a study of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). They first considered a simple decision problem comprised by 3 alternatives and 2 criteria. Next a copy of a non-optimal alternative was introduced. When the 4 alternatives (i.e., the previous 3 plus the copy) were evaluated, and under the assumption that the criteria weights are exactly the same as before, it was observed that now the indication of the best alternative can change. That is, a rank reversal may occur with the AHP. A few years later it was observed that the AHP, as well as a new variant to it that was introduced by Professor Thomas Saaty (the inventor of the AHP) in response to the previous observation by Belton and Gear, may exhibit rank reversals when a non-optimal alternative is replaced by a worse one (and not a copy of an alternative as in Belton and Gear's experiment). The issue of rank reversals has captured the interest of many researchers and practitioners in the field of decision-making. It is something that continues to be considered controversial by many and is frequently debated.  Different types of rank reversals  There are many different types of rank reversals, depending on how the alternatives in a problem are defined and evaluated. These types are described next as Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4, and Type 5. = Rank reversals of Type 1 = As stated earlier, one may introduce identical or near-identical copies of non-optimal alternatives and then check to see if the indication of the best alternative changes or not. = Rank reversals of Type 2 = Another way is to replace a non-optimal alternative with a worse one and then see if the indication of the best alternative changes or not. = Rank reversals of Type 3 = First consider a problem with all the alternatives together and get a ranking. Next, decompose the original problem into a set of smaller problems defined on two alternatives at a time and the same criteria (and their weights) as before. Get the rankings of these smaller problems and check to see if they are in conflict with the ranking of the alternatives of the original (larger) problem. = Rank reversals of Type 4 = Type 4 is like Type 3, but ignores the ranking of the original (larger) problem. Instead, check to see if the rankings of the smaller problems are in conflict with each other. For instance, suppose that the following 3 alternatives A, B, and C are considered. Next, suppose that some 2-alternative problems are solved and the rankings A > B, B > C, and C > A, are derived from these 2-alternative problems. Obviously, the above situation indicates a case of non-transitivity (or contradiction) as we get A > B > C > A. = Rank reversals of Type 5 = All previous types of rank reversals are known to occur with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and its additive variants, the TOPSIS and ELECTRE methods and their variants. The weighted product model (WPM) does not exhibit the previous types of rank reversals, due to the multiplication formula it uses. However, the WPM does cause rank reversals when it is compared with the weighted sum model (WSM) and under the condition that all the criteria of a given decision problem can be measured in exactly the same unit. The same is true with all the previous methods as well. This is the Type 5 ranking reversal. It is quite possible to define more types of rank reversals. One only needs to determine ways to alter a test problem and see how the ranking of the alternatives of the new problem differs from the original ranking of the alternatives of the original problem. Furthermore, the difference in rankings, somehow, should indicate the presence of undesirable effects.  Are rank reversals always undesirable?  Decision-making methods are used to make decisions in many aspects of human activity. This is especially true with decisions that involve large amounts of money or decisions that may have huge impact on large numbers of people. Given the well-established fact that different methods may yield different answers when they are fed with exactly the same problem, the question is how to evaluate them. Rank reversals are at the very heart of assessing the merits of such methods. At the same time, they are at the center of many heated debates in this area. Many authors use them as means to criticize decision making methods or to better explain rational behavior. Consider a simple example of buying a car. Suppose that there are two cars available to the decision maker: Car A and Car B. Car A is much cheaper than Car B but its overall quality is much less when compared to that for Car B. On the other hand, Car B is more expensive than Car A but it is also of better quality. A decision maker who is concerned of the high price issue, may choose Car A over the better quality and more expensive Car B. Next suppose that the car dealer presents to the decision maker a third car, say Car C, which is way more expensive than Car B but now the overall quality of Car C is marginally higher than that of Car B. Under such a scenario, it is quite possible for a decision maker to alter his/her opinion and purchase Car B instead of Car A, even if he/she has not actually seen Car C. Such events may take place with many rational decision makers. In other words, rank reversals may actually be possible in rational decision making. The issue of having rank reversals by rational decision makers has been studied extensively by Amos Tversky. In other words, having rank reversals in certain occasions and of certain types may not be indicative to faulty decision making. However, the key question is how to be able to distinguish when rank reversals indicate that something is wrong or when they do not conflict rational decision making. This is a highly debated issue in the decision making community.  Methods that have been verified to exhibit rank reversals  The following is just a partial list of multi-criteria decision making methods which have been confirmed to exhibit various types of rank reversals: * The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and some of its variants. * The ELECTRE (outranking) method and its variants. * The TOPSIS method. * The PROMETHEE (outranking) method. * Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT).

The floods were triggered after decades of clear cut logging practices had reduced the ability of the watershed to absorb heavy rainfall. It was the most deadly individual disaster of the 2010 China floods. The mudslides killed more than 1,471 people , while 1,243 others have been rescued and 294 remain missing. The missing were presumed dead as officials ordered locals to stop searching for survivors or bodies to prevent the spread of disease. Over 1,700 people evacuated have been living in schools.  Cause  Zhugqu County was the worst hit location, where mud submerged houses and tore multi-story blocks of flats to pieces. The seat of Zhouqu County was densely populated, with 50,000 people (42,000 of them are permanent population) in an area of . After the heavy rain, there was a buildup of water behind a dam of debris blocking a small river to the north of the city of Zhugqu; when the dam broke, around of mud and rocks swept through the town, in a surge reported as up to five stories high, covering more than 300 low-rise homes and burying at least one village entirely.Litany of warnings preceded mudslides, SCMP, 10 August 2010 The mudslide left an area long by wide in average leveled by mud with average thickness of .An image of the disaster region is at ‚Äì note that north is to the right in that image. According to Gyurme Dorje's Tibet Handbook, the forest region of Zhugqu has, since the 1950s, \\"shrunk by 30% and the reserve of timber reduced by 25% due to overfelling. The sand in the river water has increased by 60%, and the water volume has reduced by 8%, resulting in increased flooding and drought.\\" Furthermore, in this county there were between 47 and 53 hydroelectric construction projects in recent years, with 41 completed and 12 approaching deadline, according to government data. These together have caused 749,000 tons of water and soil erosion and over 3,000,000 cubic meters of bulldozed material. In 2006, a Lanzhou University report concluded that these projects have made the whole area a volatile danger-zone. The Christian Science Monitor reported that two science researchers had predicted the mudslides in 1997. The People's Daily has argued that the mudslide was due to a \\"perfect storm\\" of natural events, including \\"soft\\" \\"weathered\\" rock, heavy rainfall and drought and the Sichuan earthquake two years before. Authorities dismissed claims that the mudslides were \\"man-made\\".  Relief  The Gansu province has received 120,000,000 Chinese yuan (US$17,000,700 ) by 13 August. Hong Kong and Macau both donated millions of dollars to Gansu, with Macau donating more than US$7 million, and the United States donated $50,000 to Zhugqu County. Gyaincain Norbu, China's 11th Panchen Lama choice, donated ¬•50,000 to relief efforts and prayed for the victims.  Reaction  On 15 August, a day of mourning was observed, with flags lowered to half-mast at government buildings within China and at embassies in foreign countries. Additionally, all public and online entertainment was suspended, and major newspapers and internet sites were grayscaled. At the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, all activities were canceled. Such events are rare in China; only after an earlier earthquake in 2010 and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in recent years have such periods of mourning been observed.

The club is a current member of the Zambian Premier League although they were most successful during the early years of Zambian football. Indeed, they were the inaugural winners of the ZPL, clinching what was then called the Northern Rhodesia National Football League in 1962. They play their home matches at Kafubu Stadium.  History  = Early years: (1935‚Äì1961) = Roan Mine African Football Club The earliest organised African mine soccer team was formed in the early 1930s shortly after the opening of the Roan Antelope Copper Mine. This team was a merger of tribal teams that played gruesome non- league soccer games that were often concluded with fist battles to define which of the tribes was superior to the others. Ben Evans, the European Welfare Officer in charge of African Affairs was behind this merger. In 1935 Roan Mine was affiliated to the Copperbelt African Football Association which was divided into three leagues (A, B and C). They competed against Chingola Eleven Wisemen, Luanshya All Blacks, Kitwe Lions, Rhokana Mine, Ndola Black Follies and Mufulira Blackpool. Roan Mine FC also excelled in the Colony Cup and the Chamber of Mines competitions, the only silverware of the time alongside the CAFA league. Roan Antelope Callies Football Club (1929‚Äì1961) During the colour bar (Northern Rhodesia equivalence of the apartheid system) there existed an all European side Roan Antelope Callies FC which played in the Congo Rhodesia Border Football Association and its successor Northern Rhodesia Football Association. They used Roan Soccer Field at mine recreation club. =Birth of Roan Antelope United= The two Roan teams were instrumental in pushing for multi-racial participation in soccer and the championining of a national football league. In 1961 a select side from both teams challenged an all European side Mufulira United to a friendly game and won 1‚Äì0. An African player Ginger Pensulo scored the lone goal. In 1962 Roan Antelope United FC was born. The same year the National Football League was inaugurated with Roan's player-coach Ron Patterson as its first chairman. At the birth of Roan Antelope United were such great African stars as Innocent ‚ÄòMummy‚Äô Malama, Dick Katongo, James Temani, Ginger Pensulo, Kenny Banda, Augustine ‚ÄòBaba Gasto‚Äô Bwalya, Happy George Banda, Apro Musengule, Fix Kalunga, Laskey Mwandu, Gibson Nkumba and Samuel Yasa.1 From Roan Antelope Callies came Ron Patterson (the first NFL chairman), Frank Petler, John Flintham, Teddy Byle, John Dismuss and one unique big catch -Tony Castella. Castella was a former Portuguese international star that had played in the 1958 World Cup series alongside the legendary Mozambican Eusebio.2 Providing leadership was a powerful multi-racial executive committee comprising Richard Howie (President), Bob Menzies (Vice President), Alex Hendry (Chairman), Boniface Koloko (Secretary), Johnson Malama (Vice Chairman) and Edward Matale (Assistant Team Manager). Evans was Team Manager whilst Tony Castella took the double role of player coach. Also serving as a committee member was Sylvester Nkhoma one of the original founders of Roan Mine African Football Club.3 =Inaugural NFL Champions= In 1962, Roan Antelope United won the championship of the first ever season of the National Football League. The 1962 title remains their only one to date. Silverware Successes (1962‚Äì1963) Roan won the 1962 Castle Cup beating Nchanga Sports 4‚Äì3. In the Heinrich Chibuku Cup Final they beat Rhokana United 2‚Äì1. The same year saw Roan becoming the first club to represent the country in an international competition ‚Äì the Super Castle Cup. Winners of the Southern and Northern Rhodesia versions of the tournament competed for this cup. Roan lost 1 ‚Äì 0 to Bulawayo Rovers at Barbourfields Stadium in Bulawayo.4 In 1963 they were runners up for the league title won by Mufulira Wanderers but won the Heinrich Chibuku Cup with a 3‚Äì1 victory over Nchanga Rangers. Two teams were entered in the CAFA in which the first team were league champions and winners of the Chamber of Mines trophy. Similar honours were gained by the junior side.5 = Academy of Soccer Sciences = Roan are famed for producing great names in the history of Zambian football. The list of ex-Roan players reads like a Who's who in Zambian Soccer. Three quarters of Zambia National team , Zambia Schools and Under 20 goalkeepers are traceable to Roan United and its reservoirs. There was Innocent ‚ÄòMummy‚Äô Malama , Happy Malama, Emmanuel Mwape, Vincent Chileshe, Kenny Mwape, Ghost Mulenga, Richard Mwanza, Simon Chande, Julius Chilambo, Laston Simpasa, Simon Kapende, Anderson Banda, Gibson Ngwira and Davies Phiri. Of all these the late Emmanuel Mwape still holds the record of having been voted the best goalkeeper on the continent in 1974 at the Africa Cup of Nations. Most Zambian club success stories are linked to Roan United because of the players ‚Äòpoached‚Äô from the club. Most them also played for Zambia. For instance Kabwe Warriors was at its best in the mid 1960s and '70s with ex-Roan stars: Sunday Kaposa, Boniface Simutowe, Godfrey Mpula, Phillip Tembo, Dyson Mugala, Francis Chilombo, Simon Kapende, Guards Sakala, Daniel Chileshe, Laskey Mwandu, Jack Chanda, Godfrey Munshya, Barry Kamfwa Kayuni, Moses Masuwa and Linos Chisanga. Rhokana United enticed Fordson Kabole, Hudson Kamfwa Kasongo, Simon Chande, Bernard Chanda, Richard Mugala, Emmanuel Mwape and Gamma Mwelwa. Emmanuel Mwape‚Äôs young brother Kenny Mwape served at Mufulira Blackpool, Green Buffaloes, City of Lusaka and Power Dynamos. Ndola United benefited through Kaiser Kalambo, John Mapulanga, and Silas Kanchule and Elias Simbeye. Now defunct Kabwe United owed much of their success to Fabiano Mwaba and Anderson Banda. Kitwe United lured Happy Malama, Edward ‚ÄòVC 10‚Äô Kalale and Stephen Makungu. Bancroft (now Konkola Blades) took on Savage Bulaya, Winter Chisenga and Wink Mwape. Nchanga Rangers benefited through John Silubonde, Morris Mwansa, Vincent Chileshe and Elijah Tana. Lusaka Tigers were glad to receive Gibbon ‚ÄòKing‚Äô Nyirongo who later exported his skills to Malawi with Bata Bullets. Giant killers Strike Rovers would take on Brannel Stewart Jambila, Lasso Laimoni, Manasseh Jumbe and goalkeeper Aaron Mwape (another young brother to Emmanuel). Vitafoam befitted through the services of Richard Mwanza, Adrian Chota, Frank Mayekela, Abraham Liyembele and Lackson Chanda. Bruster Nsama and Peter Chanda were to raise Mpelembe FC to limelight whilst Laston Simpasa served Red Arrows and Green Buffaloes as goalkeeper. At Kafue Textiles Julius Chilambo together with Bernard Chanda propelled the team to limelight in the late 1980s.

Tregurtha is a Great Lakes-based bulk carrier freighter. She is the current Queen of the Lakes, an unofficial but widely-recognized title given to the longest vessel active on the Great Lakes. Launched as William J. De Lancey, she was the last of the 13 \\"thousand footers\\" to enter service on the Great Lakes, and was also the last Great Lakes vessel built at the American Ship Building Company yard in Lorain, Ohio.  Construction  The Interlake Steamship Company was given a contract in 1979 by its customer Republic Steel, to transport iron ore from Lake Superior ports to their steel mill at Indiana Harbor, or to their transshipment terminal at Lorain. Designed by the American Ship Building Company to fulfil two briefs: * Bulk carrier * Executive passenger transportation With the second brief in mind, she was one of the first freighters with full air conditioning, elevators, and luxurious d√©cor. Built in two parts, her keel was laid down on July 12, 1979, at the American Ship Building Company yard in Toledo, Ohio. On completion, the forward section was towed to their yard in Lorain, Ohio where it was mated with the stern portion. The completed hull No. 909 has a total length of . Stephens-Adamson designed a loop belt elevator system, that feeds a stern mounted discharge boom that can be swung 100 degrees to port or starboard. Capable of unloading at a rate of 10,000 long tons of iron ore per hour, or 6,000 net tons of coal per hour, the total system displaces 14,497 tons. Formally launched on February 4, 1981, the vessel was christened on April 25, 1981, as William J. De Lancey, named in honor of Republic Steel's chairman who participated in the launch. In 1990 she received her current name. Paul R. Tregurtha, born 1935, was the Vice Chairman of Interlake Steamship Company's Board.  Operations  William J. De Lancey departed Lorain on her maiden voyage on May 10, 1981, sailing in ballast to Silver Bay, Minnesota, to load 55,944 tons of iron ore pellets. She arrived back in Lorain on May 16, 1981. She holds a number of cargo records: * August 7, 1982: 63,007 ton (64,019 tonne) load at Escanaba, Michigan, for Indiana Harbor * July 20, 1983: broke the Lorain port record delivering 61,846 tons (61,846 mt) of iron ore pellets from Escanaba. She then established a lower lakes record by loading 50,239 net tons of coal from Ashtabula to Consumers Power, becoming the largest cargo loaded on the lower Great Lakes. * First 71 cargoes totaled 4,151,398 tons (4,218,086 mt), averaging 58,450 tons (59,389 mt) per load, restricted due to the lower draft in Lorain (less draft) and Escanaba to Indiana Harbor *Holds lower lakes record of 50,239 net tons of coal, shipped from Ashtabula, Ohio, to Consumers Power * 2001 season: most cargo through the Soo Locks, 3,004,957 net tons On termination of the Republic Steel contract, on May 23, 1990, she was rechristened MV Paul R. Tregurtha at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, named in honor of the Vice Chairman of Interlake Steamship Co. On May 3, 2002, her only captain died in his cabin, Captain Mitch Hallin, aged 55. In winter 2004, she was asked to transport a reserve of coal to Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, necessitating a mid-winter voyage. Loading 43,000 net tons in Conneaut, Ohio, both United States and Canadian Coast Guard services provided ice breaking assistance so that the voyage was completed without any delays. After unloading on January 29, she departed for her normal winter lay-up in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She was the subject of a television program in the first season of Discovery Channel Canada's series Mighty Ships. That program recounts how in 2008, while leaving Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, Paul R. Tregurtha got stuck in ice and cracked steel plating on the port side of her bow, causing ballast tank water to leak out. Framing beneath the plating was also bent and cracked. After undergoing repairs at the MERC dock in Superior, Wisconsin, she then loaded her coal cargo at the dock and carried it to Detroit, Michigan.  2012 and 2014 grounding incidents  St. Marys River, August 15, 2012 At around 3 a.m. on August 15, 2012, as she was proceeding downbound with 62,000 tons of coal, the bow of Paul R. Tregurtha became grounded in the outbound channel of St. Marys River, just north of the Neebish Island ferry crossing, near Sault Ste. Marie. Her stern then pivoted and grounded on the opposite side of the channel, completely blocking the approach to the Rock Cut in the Lower St. Marys River. With assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard, at 5:30 a.m. on August 19, two tugs with a combined moved the stern of the ship into the middle of the channel. This enabled salvage experts to successfully raise the ship's bow by filling stern voids which reduced the amount of forward weight on the rocks, and hence refloat the vessel. During the afternoon of September 20, 2014, she was involved in an incident in Duluth, Minnesota, when she ran aground just off the Bayfront Festival Park in the Duluth Harbor Basin, just west of the Aerial Lift Bridge.

The hotel is located on the corner of the front Esplanade and Picton Avenue overlooking the sea. The current building is dated to the mid-1930s. The distinctive white building with its red tiled roof, along with the Grand Pavilion several metres to the east, is one of the town's most prominent landmarks. The hotel has 89 rooms. History The original \\"New House\\" building in 1860 The hotel originally began around 1860 as a smaller building named the New House and was built by George Derent, an architect who designed John Street in Porthcawl. Around 1870, a larger house was built on the site and was named \\"The Seaview Bank\\". It was bought by the prominent Brogden family and John Brogden, an important figure in the town's development in the late 19th century (who gave his name to John Street) simplified the name to \\"Sea Bank House\\". This building was built with grey stonework and over time the building developed moss on the walls around the French windows. It had a prominent Italianate style tower at the front and a quaint little garden was once located at the front side of the hotel. Around 1890, the family fell into financial difficulties and it became Porthcawl College and was run by Reverend E.J. Newell of Oxford University until 1907 when it was purchased as a private residence by John Elias. View of the hotel from the beach In the 1930s a new structure and modern concrete facade was built to and it was renamed the \\"Seabank Hydro\\" hotel. During World War II the hotel was used as a base by the military and the 49th (West Riding) Reconnaissance Regiment was formed at the hotel in 1942. In 1943, US troops of the 107 Field Artillery Battalion of the 28th Infantry Division were stationed at the hotel, followed by the 75th Infantry Division in 1944 to train before the Battle of the Bulge. In 1945 the hotel underwent major refurbishment and again in the 1990s. Interior The hotel has 89 rooms and is listed by the AA as a 3-star hotel. The rooms range from single to twin and double rooms. All are en-suite and include breakfast. Historically the hotel has been used extensively for conferences and important business meetings but is now primarily a coaching hotel being part of the Leisureplex Hotels Ltd. The \\"Smuggler's Bar\\" is open to the public and seats up to 96 people overlooking the Bristol Channel with views towards Somerset and Devon. Lunch is served every day between 12.00 and 15.00.

She was the influential favorite and Kira (business agent) of Valide Sultan Safiye. Life =Early life= Esperanza Malchi reportedly originated from Italy.Lucienne Thys-Senocak: Ottoman Women Builders: The Architectural Patronage of Hadice Turhan Sultan She was married to a Jewish businessman, and had at least three sons. Due to the seclusion from the opposite sex and the outside world imposed upon the women of the Imperial Harem, male merchants were not allowed in to the harem, and a custom developed with merchant wives entering the harem to act as intermediary agents, displaying the goods to the prospective clients of the harem. These women were often Jews, who as non-Muslims were not subjected to the same gender segregation as Muslim women, and thus could act as the intermediaries of the harem women in several other areas, and many became successful businesswomen as agents to the harem women, particularly as widows. This would have been the background of Esperanza Malchi as well. Due to the fact that there were several kiras working in the Imperial Harem in parallel, and that they are seldom documented by name, it is difficult to identify individual kiras and separate them from each other. Esperanza Malchi, in particular, has often been confused with Esther Handali, who had a similar position to her and was active at the same time. When she first entered the harem is unknown, but her career does overlap with Esther Handali, who was employed by Nurbanu Sultan, the mother of sultan Murad III. Esperanza Malchi, however, was employed by Nurbanu Sultan's daughter-in-law Safiye, consort of Murad III and mother of sultan Mehmed III. =Kira of Safiye Sultan= Esperanza Malchi had the same favored position to Safiye Sultan, as Esther Handali had previously had to Nurbanu Sultan. As was common for a kira, she became the trusted confidant of her client, and her tasks soon expanded from acting as intermediary for merchant goods to acting as intermediary for other money transactions, and from there to further tasks between her client and the outside world. When Safiye became the valide sultan, mother and adviser of the reigning sultan (1595-1603), Handali's own influence reached its peak, and she was entrusted with political and diplomatic correspondence between Safiye and foreign powers. In the case of Esperanza Malchi, her position of favorite to Safiye Sultan was rumoured to be the result of a love affair between the two women, a rumour which was described by the English ambassador at the Ottoman court. Reportedly, she attempted to influence Safiye (and through her the sultan) to a policy against the Republic of Venice, and by doing so came in conflict with the Venetian spy Beatrice Michiel, who had the opposite intention: the two women once came in to open conflict in front of Safiye.Ioanna Iordanou, Venice's Secret Service: Organizing Intelligence in the Renaissance She even acted as the intermediary between Safiye and the Queen of England, and wrote to Queen Elizabeth I of England on her mistress' behalf, mentioning discreet exchanges of diplomatic items. =Death= The position of Esperanza Malchi became a cause of widespread discontent. Her influence upon the sultan's mother and through her upon the sultan himself and the policy of the Ottoman Empire was resented, as well as her powerful role in the economic affairs of the court. In the spring of 1600, the imperial cavalry revolted because of the devaluation of the currency. Malchi became the target of their discontent, and the rebels successfully demanded of the sultan that he turn Esperanza Malchi over to them. On 1 April, Esperanza Malchi was intercepted and assassinated near the house of Halil Pasha, kaimakam of Constantinople, together with her eldest son, while her second son escaped and her youngest son converted to Islam. Her assassination was seen as a hard blow to the Jewish community of Constantinople.

The gang's turf centered at the corners of 21st and Green St. where their numbers were usually seen. They specialized in armed robbery, kidnapping, and weapons dealings. According to Detective Captain James Kelly, they were, \\"the most menacing gang of teenagers\\" in Philadelphia. The Green Street Counts were active in the early 1950s. Around the same time (early to mid-1950s) another group of teenagers in Philadelphia took the name Green Street Counts (West). This group of teenagers led by Carlos were operating in a West Philadelphia neighborhood extending from 38th to 47th Streets and Walnut Street to Woodland Avenue. The Green Street Counts (West) were not affiliated with the Green Street Counts originally from the Fairmount section of Philadelphia. Among the gang, Joseph \\"Blackie\\" Battel, would go on to serve a life sentence for a robbery murder. This put the Green Street Counts in local and national headlines. Along with his co-defendants, Blackie would receive a commutation from the PA Parole Board after serving a lengthy amount of time at the Eastern State Penitentiary. After their release the Counts would later connect with the K&A; Gang of Philadelphia's Kensington section. \\"The urban gang syndrome had just begun, led by the infamous Green Street Counts, and Bell repairmen would not go into some parts of the city after dark ...The vicious saga of the Green Street Counts hit headlines in the summer of 1953. Where the tragedy of the Head Hunters resulted from a more or less casual association, the Counts were a formalized, cold-blooded organization comparable to mobs of adult racketeers. The gang, with headquarters in the congested area of the city a few blocks north of city hall, had its rigid discipline of obedience to the mob will through fear (one boy was purposely shot in the leg after showing weakness in a robbery executed by the gang). It also boasted an arsenal of firearms. To these familiar attributes of criminal mobs, were added the juvenile touches of a written constitution, in which were designated such officers as \\"Secretary of War\\" and \\"Keeper of the War Chest\\". Last week- end another gang was discovered by the police in North Philadelphia with the same sort of constitution and by-laws. In August, the Counts boldly entered a taproom in North Philadelphia, intending to hold up the bartender and patrons at the point of a gun. Panic stricken when their plan failed in execution, they shot their way out. The bartender was shot and instantly killed. One of the patrons was injured. Five boys, ranging in age from 16 to 20, were indicted. Another extremely troublesome situation which gained prominent newspaper notice was gang rowdyism on central city public transportation. In the fall of 1953, members of the Transport Workers Union employed by the Philadelphia Transportation Corp., complained that on trolley lines servicing students at two central city high schools and one junior high school, gangs of boys had vandalized trolley cars and even robbed motormen. The union officials threatened to stop trolley line service on these important central city communication lines unless immediate steps were taken. It was necessary to station police iu the trolley cars ; and. also at the trolley stops near the schools. Since that was done no new outbreak has occurred. Less than a month ago, juvenile gang warfare, between two gangs known as the Pandoras and Exiles, resulted in a boy being shot from a racing automobile by a teen-age gunman. Arrests swiftly followed, but the problem is not alleviated. These gang situations have proved extremely serious. The office of the district attorney has recommended that a Youth Commission be established by the city of Philadelphia. One of its important functions would be to strengthen social work activities with members of these gangs, in order to turn their energies into constructive or nonharmful recreational activities. Additional functions of the proposed youth commission will be discussed below. Despite the above, the magnitude of the problems treated in juvenile court or the nature of those problems must not be misunderstood. In 1953, juvenile delinquency comprised but 1.9 percent of the juvenile population from 7 to 17 years of age. (In 1952 the rate was 1.7 percent.) Moreover, all the cases which come into court are not concerned with young hoodlums who differ from their adult criminal counterparts only in the differences of age. As a matter of fact, the majority of the cases arise from backgrounds of proverty. family maladjustments, racial prejudice, excessive parental discipline or the lack of it. parental alcoholism, or immorality, or any of the other unfortunate circumstances which may engulf children. Cases involving runaway or disobedient children do not require the stern measures necessitated by gang cases or the cases of juvenile armed robbery and the like. In many ways, the former cases are more important for here. Mr. Bobo. I notice in your statement you submitted to Mr, Goff, that you spoke of the Green Street Counts and the arsenal that they had. Would you go into that problem? I believe your office was the one that handled that particular problem. Mr. Gomberg. Well, it started in the juvenile court. However, in our Juvenile Court Act, anyone over 14, if the act is sufficiently severe and the juvenile court feels that a jury trial would be in the interest of justice, can certify the case down to the criminal court. In that particular case the act was so severe that the court did certify the case to the criminal court, although some were juveniles under 18. In that case, we had a situation where some of the boys up around 21st and Green Streets, which is a distance not so far from here, had gotten together and organized a gang. They did some amazing things. They appointed officers ; they had a keeper of the war chest, a secretary of war. They had a written constitution. They had recently merged with some other gang and had formalized that by a written document. But they were not juvenile at all in the way they approached the robbery of the taproom. They went into a taproom up in North Philadelphia and they had a lookout and so on, but because they were juveniles I think very nervous something happened in the course of their robbery, they killed the bartender and injured one of the patrons in the bar. All of the people in that gang have been tried. They have all been sentenced to life imprisonment, with one exception, who will be tried shortly. That was a very serious situation....\\"http://www.porticus.org/bell/lifebellsystem.htm https://contoveros.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/escaping-brewerytown-in-1-piece- not-easy/ References External links * * Category:Street gangs Category:Gangs in Philadelphia ","title":"Green Street Counts"},{"id":"28299764","text":"\\"Chuck Versus the Suitcase\\" is the second episode of the fourth season of Chuck. It originally aired September 27, 2010. There are crimes of fashion when Chuck Bartowski and Sarah Walker go undercover in Milan for Fashion Week to seize a high-tech weapon, yet Chuck soon recognizes a flaw in his relationship with Sarah. Meanwhile, Morgan Grimes discovers a vulnerability about the new Buy More. Plot =Main plot= In Milan, a US intelligence operative chases a Volkoff operative named Sofia Stepanova (Karol√≠na Kurkov√°), who stole an ammunition clip containing smart bullets from a weapons development facility outside Paris. She kills him with one of the smart bullets. In a Team Bartowski briefing, General Beckman reveals that Sofia is the executor of Volkoff's most important weapons dealer, using her cover as a runway model. Beckman sends Chuck and Sarah to Milan Fashion Week to intercept the bullets. Sarah sees Sofia and guesses that the bullets are in Sofia's purse. Chuck Bartowski moves to retrieve it, but he is unsuccessful, and Sofia gives her purse to a bartender. When they catch him, the purse instead contains a ticking time bomb. Chuck grabs the bomb, triggering a dead man's switch, but Sarah manages to defuse it with one second to spare. Later, they break into the Presidential Suite where Sofia is staying. As they start to open her safe, Sofia enters the room and takes a shower. While Chuck flashes to open the safe, Sarah encounters Sofia's long-time bodyguard (Lou Ferrigno). Just as Chuck removes the smart bullets from the safe, a naked Sofia holds him at gunpoint. Sarah incapacitates the bodyguard and she and Chuck escape with the bullets. When they return to Castle, they are informed by General Beckman that Sofia was one step ahead of them, and the microchips have been removed from the bullets. Chuck and Sarah return to Milan after they realize Sofia hides the microchips in a sequined dress. They pass Sofia's sentries with tranquilizer gloves and Sarah changes into the dress. Chuck is challenged by her bodyguards, whom he defeats with a flash on staff fighting and his tranquilizer gloves. Meanwhile, Sofia sees Sarah and they get into a fight, which drags out onto the catwalk. Sarah defeats Sofia, and the microchips are recaptured. =Buy More= Morgan Grimes begins to notice a serious flaw in the new Buy More. The government personnel are so well trained that their excessive efficiency, pleasant demeanor and helpful service, all of which is completely opposite to the public perception of how a Buy More should be run, renders the store's cover virtually transparent. Morgan demonstrates this to General Beckman by intentionally spilling a drink, which is immediately cleaned up, then repeatedly and casually dropping merchandise, only to have it swiftly and acrobatically returned to the shelves. With Beckman's approval, Morgan and Casey begin \\"recruiting\\" the store's former staff, starting with Jeff and Lester, who have been hiding out \\"in the wild\\" (actually an urban area seven minutes drive from Burbank, with traffic) since their alleged destruction of the Buy More in \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II.\\" When the duo realize that Morgan actually wants them to return, they begin to make demands, but Casey simply tranquilizes them. When Devon shops there, looking for baby supplies, the efficiency of the place immediately makes him speculate that Chuck has not, in fact, retired from the spy world, leading him to ask questions. They point out to him that while Chuck is retired, Casey and Sarah are still spies and thus the Buy More is still their cover. When Ellie goes to the Buy More to return some of the baby goods Devon has bought, Morgan has augmented the government personnel with the store's former lazy, creepy, and surly staff, making the place feel more like its old inefficient self. In recognition of this, Beckman promotes him to store manager. =Family= Devon stresses over Ellie, who is 13 weeks pregnant and has not been sleeping well recently. He buys an excessive amount of baby merchandise and tries to keep her resting, reasoning that since she essentially raised Chuck alone without her mother, she shouldn't have to raise this child alone as well. Ellie reassures him that her mother's absence means nothing to her, and promises to let Devon help so long as he allows her to carry part of the load. She later nostalgically looks through old photos of her father (Scott Bakula) and mother (Linda Hamilton), belying her earlier protest that her mother's disappearance was of no importance to her. Meanwhile, Chuck and Sarah's relationship faces a new obstacle: Sarah's unwillingness to \\"plant roots\\", demonstrated by the titular suitcase that she refuses to unpack. Sarah states that it's a spy thing, which Chuck disproves by noting that Sofia felt comfortable enough to unpack her wardrobe in the hotel's closet. When Sarah reluctantly begins to do so after their first mission to Milan, Chuck makes her stop, and tells her to wait until she's ready. At the end of the episode, she willingly unpacks the suitcase except for a photo of her and Chuck (something she keeps in her suitcase, no matter where she is), admitting to Chuck that he is her home, he always has been. As they lie down to go to sleep, Chuck comments that maybe they're \\"next\\" to get married and have children, leaving Sarah horrified. Production Isaiah Mustafa portrayed the second Greta. This episode marked Isaiah Mustafa's first portrayal of the rotating character Greta. =Production details= *A harbor shown as part of Milan after Chuck arrives is actually one of the most famous piers of Hamburg, Germany. =Continuity= *Ellie has been pregnant 13 weeks. *Jeff and Lester have been on the run for 184 days since \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II.\\" =Flashes= *Chuck flashes on mathematics to open Sofia's safe with probable combinations. *Chuck flashes on staff fighting skills to defeat Sofia's bodyguards.

It originally aired September 20, 2010. When the CIA gains control over the Buy More, Chuck Bartowski begins searching for his mother (Linda Hamilton). Sarah and Casey follow a trail to Russia as they investigate the mysterious Volkoff Industries and its operative, Marco (Dolph Lundgren). Back at home, Ellie delivers big news to her family. Plot =Main plot= In the Bartowski home at Encino, California, in 1994, Mrs. Bartowski (Linda Hamilton) reads her son Chuck a bedtime story to cheer him up. Back in the present, Chuck finds his father's research on Mary, confirming that she was a spy . He asks Morgan to help him find her, and to keep it a secret, because Sarah and Casey would try to stop him. Chuck and Morgan travel all over the world in search of clues as to where his mother could be, until they arrive back in Los Angeles at Mary's safehouse. They find and open a safe, only to find it empty. Their only clue is a menu Morgan finds for a Chinese dumpling shop called Imperial Dragons, with a stylized Asian logo on the cover in red and black. Morgan suggests starting the search for Mary from scratch, but Chuck gives up entirely. The scene then turns to a security camera, and shows Mary sympathetically watching them. After their car gets repossessed by a repo man, Morgan confesses that their spy travels have left them in severe debt. Retired from the spy world in \\"Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II,\\" Chuck goes through a series of strange job interviews, which are each‚Äîwe later learn‚Äîsabotaged by General Beckman. Chuck and Morgan return in desperation to the Buy More, which has been converted into a joint CIA/NSA base. They are both forcibly reinstated into the CIA. While at the Buy More, Chuck flashes on the EMP generator Sarah and Casey captured, identifying a manufacturing facility in Venezuela run by Volkoff Industries. As Sarah closes the case for the EMP, Chuck notices that the red and black logo on the case is the same one that was on the Imperial Dragons menu. After retrieving the menu, Morgan notices a few menu items which are not Chinese food, and one of them triggers a flash on military equipment for submarines. By pretending to be a member of the \\"New Ring\\", Chuck arranges a meeting at Volkoff's facility in Moscow. magnificent statue outside Volkoff Industries is in Volgograd, rather than Moscow After flying to Moscow, Chuck and Morgan infiltrate the facility and start downloading a file on Mary. Chuck and Morgan receive text messages from Sarah and rescue her and Casey and return to the computer to retrieve the file. Marko informs them on the intercom that the whole building has been sealed. Chuck realizes the only way to escape is by firing an EMP, thus sacrificing the information on his mother. After escaping with AK-47s and boarding a bus, Chuck and Sarah celebrate nine months together. Back in Burbank, CA, Chuck attempts to tell Ellie that he has rejoined the CIA and is searching for their mother, but she interrupts him, under the assumption that he has taken a job at the Buy More. After she confides in him that she is pregnant, he decides to wait to reveal his secrets. =Spy world= Sarah and Casey are on a mission in Hong Kong, where they are chasing a man named Marko (Dolph Lundgren), who has a handheld EMP generator, made by Volkoff Industries. They chase him up a skyscraper, where he is given orders to use the device. Volkoff's men arrive, but Sarah and Casey escape with the device by jumping off the building with parachutes. After Chuck's flash on the EMP generator, they board a plane for Venezuela. Unfortunately, Marco is on board, incapacitates them and has them transported to Moscow, where he attempts to interrogate them as to the identities of two spies, Chuck and Morgan, who have gotten very close to Volkoff during their search for Chuck's mother. At the same time, Chuck and Morgan have infiltrated the same facility, attempting to hack Volkoff computers for information on Mary. Eventually, they figure out that Casey and Sarah are being held prisoners through text messaging. They are able to free them, but Marco announces over the intercom that the entire building is completely sealed. Team Bartowski uses an EMP device they found to escape. Once they return to Burbank, Casey and Sarah agree to assist Chuck in finding his mother. Later, Marko goes to Mary to tell her that her family is looking for her. Spurred on by this information, Mary quickly kills Marko and his men and escapes. =Buy More= The Buy More has been rebuilt by the CIA and NSA, and is predominantly ‚Äî if not fully ‚Äî staffed by government operatives and analysts working under General Beckman, who has taken over as the new manager.\\"Diane\\" Buy More nametag on BG Beckman's shirt A senior Nerd Herd employee codenamed \\"Greta\\" (Olivia Munn) informs Chuck and Morgan when they arrive that, although the store is not yet open for business, they are looking for new employees. When Chuck reluctantly goes to the manager's office in search of a Nerd Herd position, Greta gives Morgan a classified tour of the base and acknowledges her awareness of his and Chuck's billets as operatives. Beckman forcibly reinstates Morgan and Chuck to the CIA, and they are each involuntarily dropped through a new tunnel to a rebuilt Castle. Production Olivia Munn portrayed the first Greta At the San Diego Comic-Con in 2010, Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak announced that from season four the Buy More will be run by the CIA as a base of operations (much like the Orange Orange was in Season Two and Three) with an agent named Greta working undercover as a Buy More executive and \\"badass greenshirt.\\" This episode introduced the rotating character of Greta, portrayed by Olivia Munn. =Continuity= * This episode takes place nine months after Chuck and Sarah started dating in \\"Chuck Versus the Other Guy\\". * Morgan makes the same mistake that Chuck does in \\"Chuck Versus the Honeymooners\\" by using an alias that has essentially the same first and last names. =Flashes= * Chuck locates Volkoff's Venezuela facility after a flash on the EMP device. * A flash on \\"Shimira Chicken\\" tips off Chuck that the Chinese restaurant menu is in fact a means of selling weaponry. * Chuck flashes on a floor plan while at Volkoff Industries and sees that the building is a former KGB facility. * Chuck flashes (off-screen) on kung-fu for the first time in months to subdue Volkoff's men. Cultural references * Actor Dolph Lundgren twice references his role as Ivan Drago in the film Rocky IV. When preparing to torture Casey and Sarah, he uses Drago's famous quote, \\"I must break you.\\" He later references Drago again when saying of the team, \\"If you die, you die.\\" The character was previously referenced by name in \\"Chuck Versus the Final Exam\\". * The travel sequence at the beginning of this episode makes several references to popular culture: ** Raiders of the Lost Ark - The travel map references the map used throughout the Indiana Jones series. The map used by the episode was also created by Dan Curry, who also created those for the Jones films. ** I Spy - The shadow silhouettes. ** The Avengers - Morgan posing with an umbrella. * Harry Dean Stanton plays a repo man, referencing a previous role. * Chuck interviews at \\"Vandalay Industries\\", a reference to Seinfeld. * While Mary finishes reading \\"The Frost Queen\\" in 1994, a close-up shows Superman, Batman, the Joker, and Transformers action figures with Chuck's token Tron poster. * Chuck's trip through the tube slide recalls that of James Bond in Japan from the movie You Only Live Twice, both in respect to the tunnel's appearance, and the protagonist being lured into the trap door by another protagonist. The scene also is a nod to a similar scene involving Luke Skywalker on the Bespin Cloud City in The Empire Strikes Back, both aesthetically and that it was immediately preceded by the protagonist's (Luke/Chuck) refusal to work for his nemesis (Vader/Beckman). * Chuck says \\"I am a smooth operator like Sade\\" referring to Sade's song \\"Smooth Operator\\". * When Chuck says they have to go to Russia, Morgan tells him he'll have to sell the Millennium Falcon, another reference to Star Wars. * The scene with a bus serving as a \\"getaway car\\" features in its background the Golden Gate, one of the historical landmarks of Kyiv, Ukraine.

It was built in 1738-40 and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. Until 1906 it housed the main collections of Bristol's public library, which was one of the first in England when it was founded in 1613 on the same site. Users of the library included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey and Humphry Davy. From 1779 the building also contained one of the country's first public displays of fossils. History Founded in 1613, Bristol's public library was only preceded in England by those of Norwich in 1608 and Ipswich in 1612. It was originally housed in the King Street lodge of Bristol merchant Robert Redwood, who donated it to Bristol Corporation. When this building decayed the city replaced it in 1738-40 on the same site. In 1772 the King Street library was taken over by the Bristol Library Society, a subscription library. Over time its private membership would include Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey and Humphry Davy. Southey joined in 1793 and his very first borrowing, William Enfield's History of Philosophy, contained utopian material which gave him ideas for a \\"Southeyopolis\\", recorded in his correspondence of that year. This was months in advance of his development of Pantisocracy with Coleridge in 1794. In 1795 his borrowings of Classical history books corresponded to topics he was covering in a series of public lectures in Bristol. In the 19th century, complaints were recorded both by the Bristol Library Society, which wanted the space occupied by the city's collection for its own books, and by the Bristol public, who were denied access to both collections. The city eventually ejected the Society, making the library free to the public from 1856. In 1876 after a refurbishment it was renamed as the Central Library. In 1899 Vincent Stuckey Lean left a bequest of ¬£50,000 for a new library building. As a result, in 1906 the library was moved to the newly built Bristol Central Library on College Green. The King Street building eventually became a restaurant. Architecture and fittings The Bristol old library in 2017, which has been running as Chinese restaurant, Cathay Rendezvous, since 1986. The present King Street building dates from 1738-40\\\\. It was built in the early Georgian Palladian style, with a 5-window front including a 3-window centre with a pediment. The shallow porch, which has fluted Composite columns, is unobtrusive in a similar way to other buildings of the 1730s in Bristol. It was probably designed by the stonemason and carver James Paty the Elder, the first in a succession of members of the Paty family prominent as builders of 18th century Bristol, although John Strahan has also been suggested as a possible architect. Another possibility that has been suggested is William Halfpenny. The imposing and disproportionately tall first storey of the Old Library was echoed in Halfpenny's designs a few years later for Clifton Court and Coopers' Hall, although this could have been imitation of Paty's design. alt=Front showing ornamental carving It is believed that Paty did carve the building's ornamentation. Unfortunately, many of the decorative features have been lost over time and as a result of repairs. Decaying features such as a fine Bristol coat of arms on the pediment, figures of putti depicted reading books above the first floor windows, and much of the mouldings and other details, were removed in the 20th century instead of being restored. One of the putti may have survived; there is one on the wall of St Michael on the Mount Primary School on St Michael's Hill in Bristol, which may have come from the library. A west wing, projecting towards the street, was added in the late 18th century. The Old Library's reading room had contained antique furniture and fittings, including an ornate oak overmantel carved by Grinling Gibbons. These were moved to the Bristol Room of the new Central Library. Former collections A forerunner of the public library was the library of the Parish Church of St Leonards the vicars being the first Librarians. In 1613 the library's founding collection was the donation of Tobias Matthew, the Archbishop of York, who was born in Bristol. In 1906 it was transferred to the new Central Library, which also reacquired the Bristol Library Society's reference collection of 45,000 books. In the 19th century the library was the first in the country to establish a \\"Local Collection\\", containing local history books and maps. Since then the Central Library's Local Studies Service has gone on to gain \\"designated status\\" under the national Designation Scheme. The Old Library housed one of the first public displays of fossils in the country, obtained in 1779 from the bequest by the Bristolian geologist Alexander Catcott of his collections of books, fossils and minerals. Later transferred to the Bristol Museum, the fossils were destroyed in World War II. However Catcott's books were in the new Central Library and survived.

The student-produced series, co-executive produced by Yonas Michael and Sharon Ezra, parodies college life and youth culture, blending elements of a thirty- minute sitcom with a teen-oriented character drama. Produced by Georgia State Television and filmed entirely on the campus of Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia, the show has aired its first season in the spring of 2010 and is going into production for a second season in high definition for January 2011. The show revolves around the sardonic lives of five college sophomores and the very different yet equally dysfunctional situations they fall into, through the lens of a transfer student with a troubled past. By approaching various stereotypes of young people, the series explores their worlds within the context of campus life and the so-called \\"best four years\\" of their lives. The first season of Sophomores is available for online streaming at the official website. Sophomores is the story of a transfer student, Margeaux Peters (Michelle Rafferty), who comes to Bardell University, a fictional college in an ambiguous location in the United States, only to be entangled with five vastly different students who are interconnected via a shared class: Clive Jenkins (Nikko Pearson), a former high school jock and current campus joke, Lizabeth Martin (Maiya Milan Gitryte), a designer-wearing social climber who can't seem to get along with anyone, Luke Jameson (Joseph Shepherd), a passive third-time sophomore with dreams of being a rock star, and the infamous Kyla Cane (Julianna Strack), the roommate from hell who'd rather study a homicide than a textbook. Between sorority rivalries, disastrous group projects, and a shocking secret from freshman year, Margeaux quickly realizes that she hasn't quite seen it all and may not want to. The series plays on these stereotypes of college students to form a refreshingly new perspective on an old concept. Sophomores is now available on DVD and is returning for a second season in high definition in January 2011, according to Amazon.com.

The valley lies on the south perimeter region of the White Mountains in eastern Arizona, and lies south of the west-flowing Gila River, and the region transitions south into Cochise County and three large valleys, with some scattered dry lakes. The valley is endorheic, with a small dry lake called Parks Lake, and merges southwest into the north of the San Simon Valley, where the San Simon River has its origins in the flatlands, and surrounding perimeter mountains. The valley was named after Captain James H. Whitlock who commanded during the Battle of Mount Gray in 1864 which was fought near the valley. Description =Regional endorheic valley= The west-flowing Gila River is forced into a NW-West-SW excursion by the small range of the Black Hills (Greenlee County). The Whitlock Valley drains south from the range, and merges into the north of the San Simon Valley, where the San Simon River forms a playa, flatland region, then continues northwest to the Gila River.

The excise tax applies only when the quantity of firearms imported or manufactured during the year is 50 or more.Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Special Occupational Taxpayer Classes * Class 1, Usage: importer of NFA firearms * Class 2, Usage: manufacturer of NFA firearms * Class 3, Usage: dealer of NFA firearms To get a Class 1 SOT status, an importer FFL is needed, which are FFL Types 8 and 11. To get a Class 2 SOT status, a manufacturer FFL is needed, which are FFL Types 7 and 10. To get a Class 3 SOT status, a dealer FFL is needed which are FFL Types 1 and 2. Other occupations subject to tax In addition to the firearms industry, the tobacco industry is also subject to paying special (occupational) taxes, and are therefore SOTs. Specifically, manufacturers of tobacco products, manufacturers of cigarette papers and tubes, and tobacco export warehouse proprietors are subject to tax. Before 1 July 2008, segments of the alcohol trade (producers and marketers of alcohol beverages, manufacturers of non- beverage products, users of tax-free alcohol, and users and dealers of specially denatured spirits) were also subject to special (occupational) taxes.

It combines several good properties possessed by its related \\"sub\\"topologies, such as the qfh and cdh topologies.  Definition  Define a morphism of schemes to be submersive or a topological epimorphism if it is surjective on points and its codomain has the quotient topology, i.e., a subset of the codomain is open if and only if its preimage is open. A morphism is universally submersive or a universal topological epimorphism if it remains a topological epimorphism after any base change.SGA I, Expos√© IX, d√©finition 2.1Suslin and Voevodsky, 4.1 Voevodsky defines the h topology on the category of schemes to be the topology associated to finite families \\\\\\\\{p_i: U_{i} \\\\to X\\\\\\\\} of morphisms of finite type such that \\\\amalg U_i \\\\to X is a universal topological epimorphism. The qfh topology is associated to families as above, with the further restriction that each p_i must be quasi-finite.  cdh topology  While defined on all schemes, the h and qfh topology are only ever used on Noetherian schemes. The h topology has various non-equivalent extensions to non-Noetherian schemes including the ph topologyA cohomological bound for the h-topology and the v topology. The proper cdh topology is defined as follows. Let be a proper morphism. Suppose that there exists a closed immersion . If the morphism is an isomorphism, then p is a covering morphism for the cdh topology. The cd stands for completely decomposed (in the same sense it is used for the Nisnevich topology). An equivalent definition of a covering morphism is that it is a proper morphism p such that for any point x of the codomain, the fiber p‚àí1(x) contains a point rational over the residue field of x. The cdh topology is the smallest Grothendieck topology whose covering morphisms include those of the proper cdh topology and those of the Nisnevich topology.  Properties  The h topology combines a number of useful properties of its various \\"sub\\"topologies. Since if is finer than the Zariski topology, h-locally every scheme is affine. Since it is finer than the Nisnevich_topology, h-locally regular immersions look like zero sections of vector bundles. It is also finer than the √©tale topology and the fppf topology. In a different direction, it is finer than the qfh topology, so h locally, algebraic correspondences are finite sums of morphisms.Suslin, Voevodsky, Singular homology of abstract algebraic varieties Finally, every proper surjective morphism is an h covering, so in any situation where de Jong's theorem on alterations is valid, h locally all schemes are regular.  Relation to v-topology  The v-topology (or universally subtrusive topology) is equivalent to the h-topology on Noetherian schemes. On more general schemes, the v-topology has more covers.

Setting Located on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the world's largest estuary, this ecoregion covers all of Prince Edward Island, the Les √éles-de-la-Madeleine of Quebec, most of east-central New Brunswick, the Annapolis Valley, Minas Basin and the Northumberland Strait coast of Nova Scotia. This area has a coastal climate of warm summers and mild but snowy winters with an average annual temperature of around 5 ¬∞C going up to 15 ¬∞C in summer, the coast is hotter than the islands or the sheltered inland valleys. Flora The colder climate allows more hardwood trees to grow in the Gulf of St Lawrence than in most of this part of northeast North America. Trees of the region include eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), American elm (Ulmus americana), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), red maple, (Acer rubrum) northern red oak (Quercus rubra), black spruce (Picea mariana), red spruce (Picea rubens) and white spruce (Picea glauca). Fauna The forests are home to a variety of wildlife from reptiles including American black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), North American porcupine (Erithyzon dorsatum), fisher (Martes pennanti), North American beaver (Castor canadensis), bobcat (Lynx rufus), American marten (Martes americana), raccoon (Procyon lotor) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethica). The area is habitat for maritime ringlet butterflies (Coenonympha nipisiquit) and other invertebrates. Birds include many seabirds, a large colony of great blue heron (Ardea herodias), the largest remaining population of the endangered piping plover and one of the largest colonies of double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the world. Threats and preservation Most of this ecoregion has been altered by logging and clearance for agriculture with only 3% of original habitat remaining and that highly fragmented. The only large block of intact habitat remains in the area around Kouchibouguac National Park in New Brunswick, although even here logging is ongoing.

Family and education William Middlebrook was born at Birstall in the West Riding of Yorkshire the son of John Middlebrook and Eliza Priestley. His mother was a distant relation of Joseph Priestley the philosopher, theologian and scientist.The Times, 1 July 1936 p18 He was educated at Huddersfield College. In 1880 he married Alma Jackson from Morley, the daughter of William Jackson, the founder of the Peel Mills in Leeds.http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=2006210_160659 They had one son and two daughters.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Career Middlebrook went in for the law. He served his articles at Barton-upon-Humber The Times, 14 February 1908 p14 and was admitted as a solicitor in 1872The Times House of Commons, 1910; Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2004 p41 or 1873. He began to practice in Birstall but later moved to Leeds and Morley, where he lived at Thornfield House, now the Masonic Lodge.http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=2006327_161084 He built up a large practice in which he was later joined by his son Harold. Politics Middlebrook held Liberal political views, perhaps strengthened by his active and lifelong membership of the Methodist Church. In 1883 he was elected a lay member of the Wesleyan Conference and in 1893 he became Treasurer of the Methodist General Chapel Committee. He entered Liberal politics and served as Hon. Secretary to the Spen Valley Liberal Association from 1885‚Äì95.The Times House of Commons, 1910; Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2004 p41 In 1892 he was elected a member of Morley Town Council and was appointed an Alderman in 1894. He was Mayor of Morley in 1896 and in 1904 and he served as Mayor of Leeds in 1910‚Äì11. He was made an Honorary Freeman of Morley in 1919. While he was Mayor of Leeds, Middlebrook inaugurated a scheme for extending Leeds Infirmary under which nearly ¬£130,000 was raised. He received the honorary freedom of Leeds in 1926. Middlebrook entered the House of Commons at a by-election in 1908 for Leeds South. The seat had become vacant on the death of the sitting Liberal MP, Sir John Lawson Walton (1852‚Äì1908) who held the office of Attorney General at the time of his death.The Times, 20 January 1908 p8 It seems that one of the reasons Middlebrook was selected was his ability to give financial aid to the Leeds South Liberal Association. Walton had paid the salary of his political agent and Middlebrook undertook to pay the constituency ¬£100 a year.Neal Blewett, The Peers, the Parties and the People: The General Elections of 1910; University of Toronto Press, 1972 p280 This was at a time when MPs were not yet paid a salary. The by-election took place on 13 February 1908 and Middlebrook held the seat for the Liberals with a majority of 359 over his Unionist opponent Reginald Neville, with Labour's Albert Fox in third place.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p134 Middlebrook held his seat until the 1922 general election when he was defeated in a straight fight by Labour's Henry Charleton. He did not stand for Parliament again.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p163 Honours and appointments Middlebrook was knighted in 1916 and created a baronet in 1930. He served on a number of Parliamentary committees. In 1918 he was appointed to a Select Committee to look into gas prices and dividends in the wake of damage to the industry during the First World War.The Times, 20 April 1918 p7 In 1922 he was nominated as Chairman of an Inquiry set up by the International Labour Office of the League of Nations into the problem of disinfection of wool and hair infected with anthrax spores, especially relating to keeping flocks of sheep and related animal products free from contamination.The Times, 3 April 1922 p5 Middlebrook acted as Chairman of the Local Legislation Committee of the House of Commons from 1913-1922 and it was in recognition for this work that he was knighted. With this background and his local government experience it was no surprise that he was appointed to sit on the Royal Commission on Local Government set up in 1928.The Times, 24 October 1928 p11 He was sometime member of the Consultative Council on Local Heath Administration and also served as a Justice of the Peace. After the death of Lord Oxford and Asquith in 1928, a memorial to the former Liberal leader and prime minister was erected in his birthplace of Morley. Middlebrook as a Freeman of the Borough offered to have a bronze bust and tablets of Lord Oxford's history erected in the Town Hall.The Times, 10 May 1928 p9 The memorial was formally presented to the town of Morley by Middlebrook on 29 October 1928.The Times, 30 October 1928 p18 Death and heir After he retired Middlebrook moved from Morley to Scarborough where he died after a long illness on 30 June 1936 aged 85 years. He was succeeded to the Middlebrook Baronetcy by his son Harold (1887‚Äì1971).

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History The tower of St Andrew's was designed as a defensive structure; it dates from about 850 and its walls are \\"massive\\". The upper part of the tower was added in the early 11th century, and the nave dates from this time or possibly earlier. The chancel and south transept were added in the early 13th century. Alterations were made to the church in 1830, with further alterations in 1850 by John Dobson. In 1871 more additions were made by William Slater; these consisted of a north transept, a chapel, a vestry and probably the south porch. The church was declared redundant on 30 October 1973, and was vested in the Trust on 16 April 1975. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in stone, with stone slate roofs. Its plan is cruciform and consists of a nave and chancel with north and south transepts, a north chapel and vestry, a south porch, and a west tower. In the lower stage of the tower is an original round-headed window on the south side, and there is a similar window above a 19th-century lancet window on the west side. The bell openings have two lights. All the windows in the body of the church are lancets; in the transepts these are double, and the east window is a triple lancet. There are cross finials on the gables of the transepts and at the east end. =Interior= Internally there is a piscina in the chancel and in the south transept. The reredos is a mosaic depicting Saints Peter and Paul. The sanctuary is paved with mosaic, and the communion rails are brass. The carved pulpit has Frosterley marble shafts with arcading, the lectern is a carved stone eagle, and the font is octagonal on an old base. In the chancel is a Saxon cross set in a Roman block of stone.

Singh Kaur or Lorellei (1955‚Äì1998) was a new-age music composer, vocalist and instrumentalist, who had a prolific career that lasted from the early 1970s to the late 1990s, releasing 23 albums. With her angelic voice and haunting melodies, Singh Kaur was a pioneer in the growing genre of Western interpretations of Indian chanting music. Personal life Singh Kaur initially lived at the Tucson ashram, and it was there she began to flower as a musician. Although she had arrived with ‚ÄòSt. Francis‚Äô already complete, she was exposed to the eclectic musicians of the 3HO community and a new, spiritually-focused, way of living. She later moved to the Espa√±ola, New Mexico 3HO community, where her musical talents expanded and she found her footing as a composer and singer of inspiring devotional songs. It was at Espa√±ola that she met, and later married, Gurucharan Singh. Not long after their marriage, they moved to Denver to open a health food restaurant. From there, they moved to St. Louis for the purpose of opening a yoga ashram. During their years in St. Louis, Gurucharan and Singh Kaur had two children, Guru Shabd and Guru Ardas. Music In the early years of her musical life, Singh Kaur collaborated with the yogi musicians of 3HO. Her next efforts were taken directly from English translations of Sikh scripture translated by her friend Sardarni Premka Kaur and published as ‚ÄúPeace Lagoon‚Äù and, later, ‚ÄúPeace Lagoon II‚Äù. Yogi Bhajan, her spiritual guide, commissioned Singh Kaur to record a series of eight mantras, six of which she was able to complete. These were to be the highly popular Crimson Series on Invincible Records, with Kim Robertson (harp, synthesizer), and produced by Liv Singh Khalsa. These recordings remain Singh Kaur's most popular, and are frequently played in hospitals, birthing centers, holistic spas, and other sites where healing music is helpful. At one point in her musical journey Singh Kaur collaborated with Amar Singh Khalsa. He recounted her effortless creativity: ‚ÄúWe were sitting in the St. Louis airport with Yogi Bhajan, who was waiting for a connecting flight to New York City. He asked Singh Kaur to put Rakhe Rakhan Har (a Sikh verse) to music. I was sitting next to her as Yogi Bhajan tapped out the heartbeat rhythm on an empty Styrofoam cup. I wrote the rhythm down, and when we got home, we put the rhythm into Singh Kaur‚Äôs drum machine. This is the beat heard on the final recording. The next day I went off to work. When I came home that evening, I asked Singh Kaur about it, and she played a rough recording ‚Äì basically the finished piece. She had sat down in the morning and the music just flowed through her. I was always amazed and awed by her ability to put the perfect music to any words that came her way ‚Äì English or Gurmukhi.‚ÄùSat Kartar Kaur Khalsa, \\"Remembering Singh Kaur\\", Aquarian Times Magazine, 4:4, Winter 2005, p. 72 Amar Singh Khalsa and his wife, Sahib-Amar Khalsa, continued to maintain a friendship with Singh Kaur and played keyboards and viola, respectively, on subsequent recordings. Singh Kaur's biggest commercial success was her album ‚ÄúInstruments of Peace‚Äù (later retitled ‚ÄúImagine Peace‚Äù) which made the Billboard New Age Music listing in 1988. This album was produced during Singh Kaur's long-time association with Dean and Dudley Evenson, with whom she stayed and toured over a two-year period. She released two other CDs on the Evenson's ‚ÄòSoundings of the Planet‚Äô label: ‚ÄúWhat Child Is This‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSpiritus: Breath of Life‚Äù (recorded under the name of Lorellei which she co-produced with Dean Evenson). It was with the album ‚ÄúSpiritus‚Äù that she poured out her heart, writing songs in English (rather than the mantras of her previous ashram life). Her poetry and powerful musicality were on display in this masterpiece recording. Many compared her voice to that of Enya or Loreena McKennett who were popular at the time. She did a west coast tour with the Soundings Ensemble but then moved back to Hawaii where she lived reclusively. She was deeply disappointed that this album didn't receive the popular acclaim that was hoped for and soon after that, her health was affected. Later years Owing to an increasingly stressful home life, Singh Kaur left her husband and children in the late 1980s; and this crisis impacted on her state of health and the quality of her work. For this reason, the singer Wah was called in to double the vocal track on Blessings, the seventh recording in the Crimson Series. However, Singh Kaur soon regained her voice‚Äîthough her health was beginning to decline‚Äîand continued to make recordings. It was after she left St. Louis and moved back to Tucson that she met Dean and Dudley Evenson of Soundings of the Planet, who befriended her and who subsequently produced 3 albums with her. In the early 1990s, after listening to some Joni Mitchell recordings, Singh Kaur contacted her former producer, Liv Singh Khalsa of Invincible Music. She wanted to do another recording, and ‚ÄòWings of Love‚Äô was recorded in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Invincible studios. Responding to the invitation of a friend, Singh Kaur moved to Maui, Hawaii. Although she never ceased being a Sikh, she abandoned the turban, and took to wearing conventional clothing. She continued to write songs, sang in a rock band, and began to enjoy her new freedom. It was during this period that she met her future husband, Keith Drew. He knew nothing of her musical past or talents, but saw her as a feisty and gorgeous redhead. While on Maui, Singh Kaur met a kindred musical spirit, Jaiia Earthschild, and they co-created, and recorded, many songs, which remain in Ms. Earthschild's personal collection. Singh Kaur returned to the U.S. mainland in 1998, ill with ovarian cancer, to work with Gary Stadler on ‚ÄúFairy NightSongs‚Äù. Singh Kaur also recorded the tracks for ‚ÄúThis Universe‚Äù, which was released posthumously. She gave two farewell performances, one on Maui Island with her children, Guru Shabd and Guru Ardas Khalsa present, and one at the 3HO Ashram in Los Angeles. Before Singh Kaur returned to Hawaii, she gave her beloved Guild 12-string guitar and personal cassette and CD collection to Gary Stadler. Because she was very ill upon her return to Maui, she relocated to Caroline Graham Muir's house, since it was more easily accessible than the 3-story house that she and Keith shared. Despite her illness, she recorded several vocal tracks for Daniel Paul (tabla musician); she would get out of bed long enough to sing, and then lay down again. At her death, she was dressed in her favorite green velvet dress. Later, after she had been cremated, her friends chartered a boat; and, with ‚ÄòGuru Ram Das‚Äô playing over the boat's sound system, Singh Kaur's ashes were cast into the sea.

He was best known for his novels set during the Second World War, during which he was an active member of the Dutch resistance. Keilson, having worked with traumatized orphans, mainly wrote about traumas induced by the war. His first novel was published in 1934, but most of his works were published after the war. In 2010, The New York Times 's Francine Prose described Keilson as \\"one of the world's greatest writers\\", notably honouring Keilson's achievements in the year in which he turned 101 years old.Francine Prose, \\"As Darkness Falls,\\" New York Times Sunday Book Review, 5 August 2010. Biography =1928‚Äì40: Exile= From 1928 to 1934, Keilson studied pharmacology in Berlin, but due to the Nazi law prohibiting Jews from employment, Keilson was employed as a professional gym teacher in Jewish private schools, and occasionally made money as a musician. During this period, Keilson also met his first wife, graphologist Gertrud Manz (1901). In 1936, the couple went into exile and fled to the Netherlands. During his time here, Keilson wrote a few books in Dutch language, crediting himself under the pseudonym Benjamin Cooper. =1941‚Äì69: World War II and aftermath= In 1941, Keilson went into hiding and had to leave his pregnant wife behind. His wife gave birth to a daughter, Barbara, in the same year; she pretended the girl's father was a German officer to prevent prosecution. Meanwhile, Keilson had moved in with a married couple in Delft, taking on a new identity as physician Dr. Van der Linden. During this time, the Dutch resistance asked him to pay visits to Jewish children that had been separated from their parents after they had gone into hiding. These experiences in particular formed the main inspiration for Keilson's later works. Keilson reunited with his wife and daughter after the war. He and Gertrud were unable to marry before the war. In Germany they couldn't marry because of Keilson's Jewish origins. In the Netherlands it was not possible to marry for the Dutch law as German citizens. And so, when the war was over they married within the Liberal Jewish Community of Amsterdam. After the war Gertrud had to explain to the Dutch neighbours that her husband was indeed German, but also Jewish, to avoid further consequences. Keilson had to requalify for his physician's licence, should he want to work in the Netherlands, and did so. He specialized as a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. In 1969, Gertrud died. During the war, Keilson's parents were deported to Auschwitz, where both died. In later interviews Keilson expressed deep regret for being unable to save his parents. =1970‚Äì2009: Second marriage= In 1970 Keilson married literature historian Marita Lauritz (1935), 25 years his junior. Marita gave birth to his, and her, second daughter, Bloeme, in 1974. He published several more works and received little media attention. On his special birthday anniversaries, such as his 70th, 80th and 90th birthday, Dutch media would do interviews with him. =2010‚Äì11: recognition= In 2010, The New York Timess Francine Prose described Keilson as \\"one of the world's greatest writers\\". Much media attention, in both the United States and his adopted home country, the Netherlands, was given to the fact that Keilson received this acknowledgement at the age of 100. Keilson was invited to Dutch talkshow De Wereld Draait Door, where he was interviewed by presenter Matthijs van Nieuwkerk. Many more articles and interviews appeared in the following year, worldwide, and by then his Der Tod des Widersachers (\\"The Death of the Adversary\\") had been translated in 20 languages. He died on 31 May 2011 in Hilversum, at the age of 101.

Although not one of the leading footballing nations in Africa, Ethiopia has produced some outstanding teams at both club and international level as well as some talented individual players. History The Italians were the first to promote the football in Ethiopia, after 1937. No overall Ethiopian championship was played in 1938 and 1939, but there were regional leagues in the provinces of Amhara (capital Gondar), Harar (capital Harar), Scioa (capital Addis Abeba) and Galla e Sidama (capital Jimma). The \\"Campo Sportivo \\"Littorio\\" video of Littorio's inauguration: http://senato.archivioluce.it/senato- luce/scheda/video/IL5000027374/2/Impero-Italiano-Addis-Abeba.html was the first football stadium of Addis Abeba: successively it was enlarged in 1940 with tribune and athletic lanes and after WW2 was renamed Addis Ababa Stadium. In 1944 the first Ethiopian Championship was held in Addis Abeba under Haile Selassie rule, with 5 teams representing the various communities in the capital conquered by the Allies. In the final match the BMME of the British Army won the Fortitudo of the remaining Italian colonists. Participants: St. George (Ethiopian); BMME (British); Fortitudo (Italian); Ararat (Armenian); Olympiakos (Greek).Italian Addisd Abeba =Early years= Football in Ethiopia came under the control of the Ethiopian Football Federation (EFF) when that organisation was founded in 1943. The EFF affiliated to FIFA in 1953 and to the Confederation of African Football in 1957. League football was in existence before the formation of the EFF with regional leagues contested during the 1938/39 and 1939/40 seasons in the provinces of Eritrea, Harar, Amhara, Scioa and Galla-Sidamo as part of the Italian occupation. The first recognised version of the Ethiopian Premier League was contested in 1944 when five teams representing the various communities of Addis Ababa competed for a title won by the British Military Mission-BMME. The Ethiopian Cup was added the following year and has been contested regularly since (albeit with some gaps, notably in the 1960s). =Contemporary football= The Ethiopian Premier League has been an annual competition since 1948 with Saint George FC emerging as the country's leading club with 24 titles. Ethiopia was suspended by FIFA in 2008 after the Federal Parliamentary Assembly sacked Ashebir Woldegiorgis from his position as EFF President and replaced him with their candidate Ahmed Yasin. As a result, FIFA, who opposed government interference in football, suspended the country in July 2008.Ethiopia suspended by Fifa from bbc.co.uk The suspension was lifted in July 2009 following the election of new EFF leaders. International The Ethiopia national football team made its first appearance in 1947 and since then have enjoyed both highs and lows. As one of the few independent African states in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War Ethiopia were an important team in the development of the international football in the continent. =Africa Cup of Nations= Ethiopia was one of the pioneers of the Africa Cup of Nations and were one of only three teams to enter the inaugural 1957 tournament, finishing as runners-up to Egypt. They were also present at the 1959 tournament As hosts of the 1962 tournament and led by goalscorer Mengistu Worku, Ethiopia defeated Tunisia and the United Arab Republic (Egypt) to be crowned African champions for the only time in their history. They hosted the tournament again in 1968 and 1976 but by then decline had set in and their next appearance in a finals tournament came in 1982. They returned in the 2013 African Cup of Nations but got knocked-out in the group stages with only one point and finished bottom of their group. =World Cup= Ethiopia have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. =CECAFA= Ethiopia are also members of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA) and take part in its competitions. They first won the CECAFA Cup in 1987 as hosts and repeated the same triumph in 2001 and 2004 before adding a fourth title in Rwanda in 2005. =Other teams= In 2005 the Under-20s team won its sole CECAFA U-20 Championship. =Club football= No Ethiopian club side has ever won the CAF Champions League or any other international club competitions. The best performances were the semi-final places achieved by the Cotton Factory Club in 1964 and Saint George in 1967.

He started his career as a stage actor in his native country during the 1820s. He began his opera career in 1836 in Neustrelitz, and after appearing at several German opera houses, became a leading and comprimario tenor at the Vienna Hofoper from 1849‚Äì1865. He then served as the director of that theatre from 1865‚Äì1875; after which he worked in the same capacity at the Deutsches Theater Budapest from 1875‚Äì1878. Early life and career Born in Prague, Swoboda studied philosophy in his native city and spent his early career there as a stage actor during the 1820s and 1830s. In 1836‚Äì1837 he started singing in operas at the court theatre in Neustrelitz; followed by engagements at the Leipzig Opera House (1837‚Äì1838) and the Halle Opera House (1838‚Äì1839). On 22 December 1837 he created the role of the Marquis de Chateauneuf in Albert Lortzing's Zar und Zimmermann in Leipzig. In the 1840‚Äì1841 season in D√ºsseldorf he appeared opposite his wife, dramatic soprano Angelika Per√©chon-Swoboda, under the stage name Joseph Nork. In 1841 both he and his wife were engaged at the opera house in Frankfurt am Main. He continued to perform there through 1848 as Joseph Nork, mostly in buffo and comprimario roles. In 1846 his wife died at the age of 30. Their son, Albin Swoboda, Sr. (1836‚Äì1901) would later become one of the most famous opera singers in the \\"Golden Age\\" of Viennese operetta, and their other son Karl Swoboda was also an opera singer. Their grandson Albin Swoboda, Jr. was a successful bass-baritone.Swoboda, Joseph bio at operissimo.com Singing in Vienna In 1848‚Äì1849 Swoboda performed at the Carltheater in Vienna, once again using his real name, Joseph Swobada. He then joined the Vienna Hofoper in the autumn of 1849 where he was billed as Wilhelm Swoboda. He became one of the main tenors at that house, singing both leading and supporting roles there up into the mid-1860s. Among the parts he sang in Vienna were Beausoleil in Le panier fleuri, Chapelou in Le postillon de Lonjumeau, Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, Count Juliano Le domino noir, Daniel in Zampa, Elvino in La sonnambula, Franz in Faust, Max in Der Freisch√ºtz, Peter Ivanov in Zar und Zimmermann, Sim√©on in Joseph, Tamino in The Magic Flute, Tybalt in I Capuleti e i Montecchi, and the title role in Fra Diavolo. He also appeared as a guest artist during these years in theatres throughout Germany and in Prague, and was frequent performer at the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna. Opera director In 1865 Swoboda retired from his singing career when he was appointed the director of the Vienna Hofoper. He left that position in 1875 to take over the general management of the Deutsches Theater Budapest with his son Albin serving as artistic director. Financial difficulties plagued the theatre during his time there; eventually causing him to leave in January 1878. His son replaced him as general director. He died four years later in Berlin.

Biography Ilyin was born in Leningrad on 26 December 1947. He was less than two years old when he was taken away from his alcoholic parents and grew up in a foster family. He entered a topographical technical school and desired to become a geologist. However, after travelling to many different regions, a \\"depressing impression\\" was left on him of \\"poverty, drunkenness, devastation\\" - different to what Soviet television showed. As a result, he drafted a reform plan which included a monthly payment to each citizen from natural resource sales, which he sent to the Kremlin, but did not receive a response. He said that was when he decided to kill Brezhnev so that everyone would know of his ideas, where he planned to speak about his plan in court. He spent almost a year preparing to assassinate him and joined the army after graduation to gain access to weapons. He was distressed by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and had questioned local ideology officials about the Prague Spring. He had learned about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and had reportedly admired Lee Harvey Oswald. Ilyin had learned that he had lived his life with his foster parents, while his biological parents were alcoholics. When Ilyin was on duty, he stole two Makarov guns and four magazines from his army unit's safe and went to Moscow. Ilyin spent a day with his uncle, a Soviet police worker, and stole his uniform before going to Red Square. He went to the Kremlin, and looked for the best firing position, choosing a place a few metres from the entrance gate. When the motorcade entered the gates of Borovitskaya Tower, carrying cosmonauts and top Soviet leaders, Ilyin fired his pistols at the second vehicle that he thought was carrying Leonid Brezhnev. However, the vehicle was occupied by the cosmonauts Georgy Beregovoy, Alexei Leonov, Andrian Nikolaev, and Valentina Tereshkova. A bullet killed the limousine driver Ilya Zharkov who was driving as a substitute on his last day before retirement. Beregovoy was wounded, and Vasiliy Zatsipilin, who was part of the motorcycle escort, was also hit, but was able to aim his motorcycle at Ilyin, bringing him down. The guards were able to take control, as Ilyin suffered a seizure. Yuri Andropov, head of the KGB, questioned Ilyin. He confessed that he was planning to take over from Brezhnev and form a non-communist party. He was facing the death penalty, but after an investigation, he was considered insane and was placed in a mental hospital in solitary confinement for 20 years. In 1990, he was set free, following a Supreme Court ruling. In 2009, at which point he was living in a government-provided apartment in Saint Petersburg, he told RT that he regrets the death of the innocent man he killed.

They are situated in the North Curve corner section of Celtic Park.  Controversy  At a match against Dundee United in November 2010, there was serious disorder in the section occupied by the Green Brigade when a supporter was being ejected by stewards. Supporters charged at the security guards and one was left with a bloody lip after a coin was reportedly thrown. In April 2011 at the Scottish Cup semi-final against Aberdeen, police officers attempted to remove a supporter who had set off a flare inside the stadium. Police were unable to remove the supporter because other fans held onto him. Four supporters were later held by police in connection with the incident. More than 100 Green Brigade members walked out of the stadium in protest at the arrests. In April 2011 some members of the Green Brigade were not sent season ticket renewal forms after the club threatened to disperse the group around other sections of the stadium. UEFA head of communications William Gaillard, when talking about the matter in 2006, said that chants related to the IRA were not sectarian, and was a nationalist issue ‚Äì similar to fans of other clubs, such as FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, who support nationalist movements in their own countries. He also stated that in Balkan countries, where some fans show support for political organisations that had engaged in ethnic cleansing, was the situation different because these organisations were by their nature discriminatory. He said that in his opinion this did not apply to the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Former Celtic manager David Hay has called for singing of IRA anthems to be banned, while current Celtic manager Neil Lennon has also repeatedly said that the chants embarrass the club.  Poppy protest  Celtic players with poppies on their shirts, November 2010 At a match against Aberdeen in November 2010, the Green Brigade unfurled two banners with the words \\"Your deeds would shame all the devils in Hell. Ireland, Iraq, Afghanistan. No bloostained poppy on our Hoops.\\" This protest was against the placing of the remembrance poppy on Celtic's shirt for the match against St Mirren on 11 November 2010. The Green Brigade cited civilian deaths caused by the Armed Forces in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Bloody Sunday, highlighting that the Saville Inquiry report \\"confirmed that 14 unarmed civilians were murdered in Derry in 1972 by the Paratroop Regiment\\". The Glasgow Herald reported that in the weeks leading up to the incident, the Green Brigade had stepped up pro-IRA chants. Celtic has been investigated by UEFA in the past for alleged sectarian behaviour, including pro-IRA chants. Veteran reporter Robert Fisk praised Celtic fans' reaction to the poppy, claiming it had become a 'symbol of racism' and as such the Green Brigade should be commended for their stance.https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/poppy-symbol-racism-never-worn- one-never-will-robert-fisk-remembrance-day-first-world-war-second-world- war-a7394976.html  Support for Black Lives Matter  In response to the killing of George Floyd, the Green Brigade supported the Black Lives Matter movement and changed a number of streets signs in Glasgow - renaming them after prominent black civil rights leaders and activists.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/change-gonna-come- green-brigade-22162274  Palestinian solidarity  On Celtic's last game of the 2011‚Äì12 season, the Green Brigade organised a display of solidarity with Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike. This featured a banner reading \\"Dignity is More Precious than Food\\" alongside Palestinian flags. A spokesman for the Brigade stated: \\"We did this in solidarity, to raise awareness and because it's the right thing to do. We want Palestinians to know we are thinking about them and encourage Scottish civil society to look at the injustice in Palestine.\\"A Celtic message to Palestine. Al Jazeera English (13 June 2012). Retrieved on 2016-12-31. Celtic were fined ¬£8,619 by UEFA for supporters flying Palestinian flags at an August 2016 UEFA Champions League qualifying match against Hapoel Be'er Sheva at Celtic Park. The Green Brigade crowdfunded ¬£176,000 in response, the balance of which it donated to Palestinian charities.  Appreciation from Neil Lennon  The Green Brigade expressed solidarity with Celtic manager Neil Lennon, who in 2011 had been attacked on the trackside by a Hearts supporter at Tynecastle and been sent letter bombs by criminal elements of the Rangers fanbase. After the last match of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Lennon 'presented' the Scottish Premier League trophy to the Green Brigade by placing it in front of the section where they sit. He later said, \\"I just wanted to say thank you to them because they have, week in, week out, created a great atmosphere. They sing non-stop. They add colour. Sometimes they are a little bit controversial but in the main they have behaved themselves impeccably and they have changed the culture of the stadium. It's a fun place to come for the supporters and the atmosphere in the big games has been fantastic. They are the catalyst for all of that.\\" Banners paying tribute to Neil Lennon, March 2011  125th anniversary display  In November 2012, the Green Brigade organised a full stadium pre-match card display against Barcelona to celebrate Celtic's 125th anniversary. The display featured a Celtic cross, green and white hoops and 125 Celtic in written form, with supporters earning the praise of club chairman Peter Lawwell.  Fans Against Criminalisation Protests  On 6 April 2013, the Green Brigade took part in a demonstration comprising 3,000 Celtic supporters as part of Fans Against Criminalisation, a body comprising the Green Brigade, the Celtic Trust, Celtic Supporters Association, the Affiliation of Registered Celtic Supporters Clubs and the Association of Irish Celtic Supporters Clubs. Although the march to Celtic Park after the demonstration had not been granted permission, raising concerns about dispersal amongst police, after the event Police Scotland said they were \\"delighted\\" by the conduct of the protesters. The protest was organised after a previous march that had not received council permission was broken up by police on 16 March. The initial protest had been called over supporters receiving bans and what was described as \\"harassment by the police\\". The Green Brigade announced on its website that it would be holding a \\"corteo to Celtic Park to raise awareness and show support for the growing list of Celtic supporters receiving and facing bans from both the Club and the PF. It is no secret the level of harassment many fans receive at the hands of Strathclyde Police nor is Celtic PLCs complicity able to be ignored. As such there is an ever growing list of fans being denied their passion of following their team.\\" Fans took to social media after the initial protest, posting pictures of mounted police and a group of supporters surrounded by police with batons being prevented from leaving the area. Celtic fans felt that the initial demonstration had been improperly policed and turned out to show their support for those demonstrators. The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which gave rise to the protests, was eventually repealed in April 2018.  Celtic move to disband Green Brigade  Celtic made moves to disband the Green Brigade section at Parkhead after trouble at a match against Motherwell at Fir Park on 9 December 2013, where fans damaged the stadium seating and threw flares onto the pitch, causing around ¬£10,000 worth of damage. Celtic had already issued a warning to the group after safety breaches in August 2013, and following the incident at Fir Park, Celtic issued \\"precautionary\\" suspensions to 128 supporters. 250 season-ticket holders in the group's adopted section of the Celtic Park, section 111, were moved to other parts of the ground, or given the option of a refund for the rest of the season. \\"We will not allow the great name of Celtic to be damaged in this way ‚Äì our supporters deserve more than this,\\" said Celtic in a statement. The Green Brigade disputed the decision of the club and argued that its members were not responsible for the damage, but added it should have been more effective in self-policing.  UEFA sanctions  Banners featuring a \\"paramilitary-style\\" motif alongside Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, displayed during a match with the Belfast-based, largely unionist club Linfield in 2017. Between 2011 and 2017, Celtic were punished with substantial fines by UEFA ten times for \\"misconduct from supporters during European ties\\". In December 2013 UEFA issued the club with a ‚Ç¨50,000 (¬£42,000) fine as a result of a banner unveiled by the Green Brigade at a UEFA Champions League match against AC Milan which displayed a political message (UEFA rules prohibit the display of banners of a political or ideological nature). The banner attracted further controversy for the use of the image of IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. During the 2017‚Äì18 season, the second qualifying round draw set up an all-United Kingdom clash with Belfast club Linfield. In the leg held at Windsor Park, some Linfield supporters threw bottles and coins at Celtic players and sang sectarian songs. During the return fixture, \\"illicit banner\\" displays were produced and UEFA charged Celtic again. The banner \\"showed a paramilitary-type figure\\" next to an image of Brendan Rodgers, the Northern Irish manager of Celtic, under the words \\"Brendan's undefeated army\\"; the Daily Record accused the Green Brigade of designing the flags, and also claimed that the \\"undertones of the imagery were also clearly referring to the politics of Ireland while a section of Celtic fans were also heard singing pro-IRA songs during the powderkeg tie with the Belfast side. Linfield are seen as a Protestant Unionist club in Northern Ireland and fans of both sides had earlier hurled abuse at each other as they made their way into the stadium\\". Celtic elected to close off the zone that holds the Green Brigade for the following two matches. References Category:Celtic F.C.

Many of these disqualifications are applied to the continuing role of the kohen in the Mishnah, Talmud and later rabbinical literature, as well as in some schools of modern Judaism. Hebrew Bible =Physical disqualifications= These blemishes include: #blindness #lameness #an excessively low nasal bridge (such that a straight brush could apply ointment to both eyes simultaneously) #disproportionate limbs #a crippled foot or hand #cataracts #a white streak that transverses the junction between sclera and iris #certain types of boils #crushed testicles A Kohen who was afflicted with one of these imperfections would be deemed unfit for service. However, should it be a correctable imperfection, he would become re-eligible for service once the defect is corrected. Although unable to serve, he was permitted to eat of the Terumah (holy food). Kohanim with these blemishes would be allowed to perform work in the Temple outside of sacrificial service itself. Defilement by uncleanliness Since the priests served a unique role of service amongst the nation of Israel, e.g. service in the Holy Temple and consumption of the Holy Terumah, so the Torah required them to follow unique rules of ritual purity, in order to protect them against ritual defilement (tumah). Some of these rules are still maintained today in Orthodox Judaism. = Defilement by contact with the dead = *Kohanim are forbidden to come in contact with dead bodies. They are permitted, however, to become defiled for their closest relatives: father, mother, brother, unmarried sister, and child. Defilement of a Kohen to his wife, although not biblically explicit, is permitted by Rabbinical order. *A Kohen is forbidden to enter any house or enclosure, in which a dead body (or part therof), may be found (, , , ) Practical examples of these prohibitions include: not entering a cemetery or attending a funeral; not being under the same roof (i.e. in a home or hospital) as a dismembered organ. The exact rules and regulations of defilement are quite complex, but a cursory rule of thumb is that they may not enter a room with a dead person or come within a few feet of the body. Proximity to the corpse of a non-Jew is less serious and may only be an issue if actual contact is established. According to Orthodox Jewish practice, modern-day kohanim are obligated to guard against ritual defilement as prescribed by the Talmud. In order to protect them from coming into contact with or proximity to the dead, Orthodox cemeteries traditionally designate a burial ground for kohanim which is at a distance from the general burial ground, so that the sons of deceased kohanim can visit their fathers' graves without entering the cemetery. They are also careful not to be in a hospital, airplane, or any enclosed space where dead bodies are also present. Exceptions to Tumah defilement The Talmud prescribes that if a kohen, even the Kohen Gadol, chances upon a corpse by the wayside, and there is no one else in the area who can be called upon to bury it, then the Kohen himself must forgo the requirement to abstain from Tumah and perform the burial (Meis Mitzvah). The Talmud also permits the Kohen to defile himself in the case of the death of a Nasi (Rabbinic leader of a religious academy). The Talmud relates that when Judah haNasi died, the Priestly laws forbidding defilement through contact with the dead were suspended for his burial ceremony.Talmud Bavli, Kesubos 103b, Tosfos ◊ê◊ï◊™◊ï ◊î◊ô◊ï◊ù, Talmud Yerushalmi, Brachos Perek 3 =Marital defilement= *A male Kohen may not marry a divorcee, a prostitute, a convert, or a dishonored woman () () A Kohen who enters into such a marriage loses the entitlements of his priestly status while in that marriage. The Kohen is not permitted to forgo his status and marry a woman prohibited to him (). However, in the event that a Kohen transgresses a marital restriction, upon termination of the marriage the Kohen is allowed to re-assume his function and duties as a full Kohen. Modern-day kohanim are also prohibited from marrying a divorcee (even their own divorced wife); a woman who has committed adultery, had been involved in incest, or had relations with a non- Jew; a convert; or the child of two converts. A born-Jewish woman who has had premarital relations may marry a kohen only if all of her partners were Jewish. The daughter of a Jewish mother and non-Jewish father, while halakhically Jewish, is prohibited from marrying a kohen according to the Shulchan Aruch, reiterated by Rav Moshe Feinstein. Due to a small doubt about this in the Talmud (Yevamos 45A-B), if such a marriage is performed the couple would not have to get divorced, see Shulchan Aruch 4:19. The sons of such a union do remain Kohanim but there is a doubt as to whether they would be allowed to serve in the 3rd Temple. The London Beth Din will not perform such a marriage but allegedly U.S. and Israeli Modern Orthodox synagogues will. *Talmudically, were a kohen to marry in disregard of the above prohibitions, his marriage would be effective. Children born of the union do not have mamzer status. However, these children, are termed Chalal (\\"disqualified\\") and do not possess Kohen status. However, the children born of the union of a Kohen married to the daughter of a non Jewish father are not disqualified, as the prohibition is considered a \\"Safek Pagum\\", (doubtful blemish). *The high priest may marry a virgin only. =Other defilement= *During the period of the Tabernacle and Temple the priests were required to abstain from wine and all strong drink before and while performing their priestly duties (, ). Rabbinical commentary According to the 13th Century \\"Book of Education\\", since the Temple was a place of beauty and the services that were held in it were designed to inspire visitors to thoughts of repentance and closeness to God, a less than physically perfect priest, and a less than perfect spiritual ambiance, would mar the atmosphere.

The target audience was that of teenagers and it initially dramatised the lives of seven of that age group who lived in Hollyoaks, a fictional suburb in the city of Chester in Cheshire, England. 1990s Phil Redmond (Pictured) felt there was a need for a British serial aimed at a teenage audience. Suggestions for a serialised television drama that would explore the lives of late-teenage characters were put to producer Phil Redmond in the 1980s by viewers of his Grange Hill school-based drama series. The suggestions came from Grange Hill viewers but Redmond was unable to pursue the idea at the time due to his production commitments with another successful television drama serial, Brookside. In the early 1990s UK television broadcaster Channel 4 sought ideas from independent production companies for a serial to be aimed at a teenage audience. At this point Redmond explored the earlier suggestions made to him, developed the theme and pitched it to the broadcaster as The Teenage Soap. He felt that there was a need for a home-grown British counterpart to the imported serials then being aired by other UK broadcasters and which targeted the teenage audience, such as Home and Away, Neighbours and Beverley Hills 90210. Channel 4 chose Redmond's plans from the pitches presented to it and within months production had begun. The premise of the serial at its inception was to focus on seven teenagers living in the city of Chester, and in particular to deal with teenage rites of passage. The first episode aired on 23 October 1995 and achieved an audience of three million in the UK. The seven principal characters were Natasha Andersen (Shebah Ronay), Kurt Benson (Jeremy Edwards), Jambo Bolton (Will Mellor), Maddie Parker (Yasmin Bannerman), Dawn Cunningham (Lisa Williamson), Louise Taylor (Brett O'Brien) and Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard). The series, which aired once per week, was initially panned by television critics and was subject to adverse press attention. However it proved popular with the teenage audience at which it was aimed. In 1996 a second weekly episode was commissioned. Redmond did have to adjust the style of the series somewhat as audience opinion was found to be that in fact the programme concentrated too much on humour and not enough on serious storylines. An early example of the change in style to issue-focussed storylines was seen when Redmond wrote out the character of Natasha, killing her off with a spiked drink. Later in the 1990s a further two weekly episodes were commissioned to bring the total output to four episodes per week. Audiences rose to four million, before they fell to an average of around nearly 2 million per week. 2000s By March 2000, Redmond had handed over his production responsibilities to Jo Hallows and in that year a series of open auditions were held around the country using the title On The Pull. The number of attendees was far in excess of anticipations - indeed, there were thousands - but it is claimed that all were seen and the most promising of them were called to further auditions in Liverpool. As a consequence of this process, several new cast members were engaged: *Marcus Patric and Andrew Somerville were cast as Ben Davies and Theo Sankofa, respectively, having attended the initial auditions in London *Elize du Toit attended the Edinburgh auditions and was cast as Izzy Cornwell * The Belfast auditions produced Lesley Johnston to take the role of Laura Burns In 2002, Johnston left the programme to become a midwife. On 21 April 2003, Hollyoaks celebrated its 1000th episode which saw the unmasking of serial killer Toby Mills. The serial was broadcast by TVNZ in New Zealand and was such a success that in 2004 the BBC soap opera EastEnders was axed there in order to accommodate it in the schedules. The same year saw Mikyla Dodd leave her role of Chloe Bruce after four years in order to pursue other projects. Helen Noble also left but agreed to return for four more episodes in 2005 and has claimed that the possibility of returning again remains open. A similar claim was made by Sarah Jayne Dunn who played Mandy Richardson, who left in 2006 to pursue other projects The departure of Alex Carter and Gemma Atkinson, who played siblings Lee and Lisa Hunter in 2005 caused producer David Hanson, who had taken over from Hallows in January that year, to write out the characters' parents Les (John Graham Davies) and Sally (Katherine Dow Blyton). At the same time Du Toit left for an acting career in Los Angeles. Bryan Kirkwood replaced Hanson as producer on 16 January 2006. His task was to rejuvenate the series and change a perception that because the cast were good-looking they were therefore unable to act. The Dog in the Pond where the explosion took place Kirkwood introduced the new character of Mercedes McQueen, played by Jennifer Metcalfe. He also recast the role of Clare Devine from Samantha Rowley to Gemma Bissix and removed several characters including Jeremy Peterson (Simon Cole), Joe Spencer (Matt Milburn), Olivia Johnson (Rochelle Gadd), Mel Burton (Cassie Powney), Sophie Burton (Connie Powney), Sam Owen (Louis Tamone), Rob Owen (David Prosho), Carrie Owen (Jaq Croft), Nicole Owen (Ciara Janson), Bill Ashworth (John Jardine) and Foz (Benjamin Hart). Sam Owen, Olivia Johnson, Joe Spencer, Sophie Burton and Mel Burton were subsequently killed off in an explosion at The Dog in the Pond. The issue of carbon monoxide poisoning was addressed by the programme in 2007. It emerged subsequently that the storyline had help to save the life of a viewer who was actually suffering from such poisoning at the very time of watching the broadcast. Beth Cordingly, the viewer, said that \\"The only respite I had in the middle of all my pain was Hollyoaks. I can't believe I owe my life to it.\\" 2007 also saw Kirkwood sack relative newcomer Devon Anderson, who had played Sonny Valentine, because of timekeeping issues while Guy Burnet quit the role of Craig Dean after five years. Sarah Jane Buckley filmed her final scenes as Kathy Barnes in the same year and left in a storyline in which she started harassing the Ashworth family, At the same time Jessica Harris, who had played Jennifer Bidall, was also written out as she decided to concentrate on theatre roles. On the incoming side, Kirkwood introduced Hannah Tointon to play the character of Katy Fox, but she left a year later In May 2008, the returns of Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) and Mandy Richardson were announced due to the departures of long-term characters Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) and Sam \\"O.B.\\" O'Brien (Darren Jeffries). James Sutton then quit his role as John Paul McQueen. Around the same time the character's on-screen boyfriend Kieron Hobbs was written out, seeing actor Jake Hendriks last appear, however the announcement came after mass online petitions were set up try and change the producers mind on axing the character. In November the established sibling characters of Ravi (Stephen Uppal) and Leila Roy (Lena Kaur) were joined by their fictional family of Govinda (Anthony Bunsee), Bel (Nila Aalia), Anita (Saira Choudhry) and Ash (Junade Khan). In October 2008 it was announced that Kirkwood had decided to quit and that his deputy, Lucy Allan, would take over the role, although it was not until 1 June 2009 that she was credited as executive producer on screen because of filming lead times. In the same month as Kirkwood's announcement Roxanne McKee left her role as Louise Summers after three years in the serial. November 2008 saw Emma Rigby, who had won Best Actress at an awards ceremony in 2008, announce that she was to leave the show in order to pursue other projects. However, she then extended her contract by a further six months after Allan convinced her to stay. Allan's first signings were Loretta Jones (Melissa Walton) and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh), both of whom had previously featured in the spin-off series Hollyoaks Later. In April 2009, Stuart Manning quit his role of Russ Owen in order to try new projects. In June 2009 Zoe Lister quit her role of Zoe Carpenter. and Loui Batley also left. Batley's character, Sarah Barnes, died in a skydiving accident caused by Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). The storyline was a first for British soap opera and the scenes went on to win the category of \\"Spectacular Scene of the Year\\" at the British Soap Awards. The scenes also earned nominations at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards in the categories of \\"Best Exit\\" and \\"Best Stunt\\". In July 2009 three members of the recently introduced Roy family - Ash, Bel and Govinda - left the programme. In October 2009 the series came under the media spotlight for airing scenes that involved Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) and Barry Newton (Nico Mirallegro) attempting to commit suicide by jumping from a bridge into water below. The storyline came into the media spotlight after two young girls in Scotland jumped from the Erskine Bridge into the River Clyde, subsequently dying in their suicide pact. The serial's broadcaster decided to go ahead and air the scenes, citing that any similarities were entirely coincidental and they had carefully thought out the decision. The real-life care home in which the two girls were housed issued a statement criticising the broadcaster for airing the scenes, stating: \\"The decision to air this show is likely to cause further distress.\\" Allan later revealed they were her favourite scenes of 2009. In November 2009, the character of Loretta Jones became the centre of controversy when various media outlets revealed that Loretta would be part of a child murder storyline. The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline and when interviewed by Click Liverpool, she criticised the decision to air a plot without consulting her first. Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, but it was abandoned soon afterwards. In December 2009, Hollyoaks became the first British soap opera to air a 'flash forward' episode whereby the storyline looked six months into the future. The episode focused on the second wedding of Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle) and Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna). It also saw Calvin's murder, starting a six-month-long whodunnit. 2009 also saw the first time in the history of Hollyoaks that it received praise from reputable broadsheet newspapers, being The Times and The Guardian who claimed the soap had become compelling viewing. 2010s Leila Roy was written out after Kaur decided she wanted to work elsewhere from serial drama. Mike Barnes left after Tony Hirst decided he wanted to try producing plays. It was announced on 15 January 2010 that Paul Marquess would succeed Lucy Allan as the series producer. His first episode was broadcast on 5 July 2010. Marquess then announced he wanted to take the serial back to its roots and change the way its stories are told. In February 2010 he axed three characters, Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood), Suzanne Ashworth (Suzanne Hall) and Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea) as well as replacing three of the soap's leading producers including, Henry Swindell, Caroline Roby and Rachel Hall who were replaced by Trina Fraser and Claire Fryer. In the same month it was announced that former Emmerdale actress Sheree Murphy would join the cast as Eva Strong, the biological mother of Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry). This was his first signing since becoming series producer. Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their character would be axed. In March, Marquess axed further characters, including Sasha Valentine (Nathalie Emmanuel), Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson), Leo Valentine (Brian Bovell), Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley), Spencer Gray (Darren John Langford), Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard), Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre), Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge) and Des Townsend (Kris Deedigan). Nico Mirallegro who plays Barry Newton and Gerard McCarthy who plays Kris Fisher, both quit to pursue other roles. Marquess decided to write Loretta Jones out after he felt there was nowhere left to take her as a result of her child murder plot being rewritten. It was also revealed that Marquess would introduce a new family to the soap. In the same month it was announced Marquess would reintroduce Lee Hunter (Alex Carter). It was also announced that Footballers Wives actress Phina Oruche would join the cast as the mother of the soap's new four-member mixed race family. In April 2010, it was announced that Marquess would introduce a raft of new characters to the serial as part of its major revamp. The characters announced were, the Costello family consisting of mother Heidi (Kim Tiddy), father Carl (Paul Opacic), sons Riley (Rob Norbury) and Seth (Miles Higson) and daughter Jasmine (Victoria Atkin), the Sharpe family consisting of mother Gabby (Phina Oruche), father Phil (Andonis Anthony), son Taylor (Shaun Blackstock) and daughter Amber (Lydia Lloyd-Henry). As well as Heidi's cousin Mitzeee Minniver (Rachel Shenton). It was later announced that Marquess would introduce a new family member for established family the McQueen's. It was announced in April that Channel 4 had commissioned a third series of Hollyoaks late night spin-off Hollyoaks Later and that the series would be headed up by Marquess. Confirmed regular characters slated to be involved were also revealed, Mercedes (Jennifer Metcalfe) and Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace), Michaela (Hollie-Jay Bowes) and Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) as well as newcomers Carl, Riley and Seth Costello and Mitzeee. In June it was announced UFC fighter Michael Bisping had been cast in Hollyoaks Later as an underworld gangster called Nathan. In the same month it was revealed that Hollie-Jay Bowes who plays Michaela McQueen had been sacked by Marquess due to her behaviour as well as being dropped from spin-off Hollyoaks Later. In early June it was announced that Marquess would introduce Kevin Smith (Cameron Crighton) who would befriend Elliot Bevan (Garnon Davies), in a new sci-fi alien storyline. In April, Marquess announced the introduction of a third family to the soap. In June the family were unveiled as the O'Connors consisting of stepmother Diane (Alexandra Fletcher), father Rob (Gary Cargill), daughter Sinead (Stephanie Davis) and son Finn (Connor Wilkinson). In the same month Marquess revealed the introduction of a new title sequence and theme tune. Marquess also announced more new cast later in the month, including Cheryl Brady's (Bronagh Waugh) half-brother Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), Cheryl's best friend Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) who previously appeared in the first series of spin-off Hollyoaks Later and McQueen cousin Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke). In July it was announced Marquess would introduce Seth Costello's twin Jasmine (Victoria Atkin). In the same month it was announced that he would reintroduce India Longford's (Beth Kingston) sister Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse- Spendlove) who previously appeared in the soap for a short stint in May 2010. It was also announced that Marquess would introduce three new students to the series, consisting of Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik), Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) and Leanne Holiday (Jessica Forrest) who would also appear in new internet spin-off Hollyoaks: Freshers. Carley Stenson became the longest serving female cast member, being a part of the serial for ten years, but then announced her decision to quit. Paul Marqess brought forward Allan's previous plans to tackle the issue of cervical cancer using the character of Steph to portray it. Stephen Uppal who played Ravi Roy then quit. On 9 July 2010 Ashley Slanina-Davies, Glen Wallace, John Pickard and Garnon Davies all announced their decision to leave their roles of Amy Barnes, Malachy Fisher, Dominic Reilly and Elliot Bevan retrospectively. Ricky Campbell was quietly written out of the serial for six months after Ashley Margolis decided to concentrate on his GCSE's. In August 2010 it was announced that Sheree Murphy had decided not to renew her contract with the serial because she planned to move abroad with her family. An exit storyline was devised for Eva. Her plans later changed and she decided to stay in the UK, Marquess decided to bring Eva back after a short on-screen hiatus, of which he stated: \\"Sheree will be taking a little break on screen because of her family commitments, but we're already thinking about how we'll bring her back.\\" Marquess later cast disabled actor Peter Mitchell in a new regular role. 2010 also saw the viewing figures for Hollyoaks drop below one million. This caused speculation over the serial's future but Marquess dismissed rumours that the show might be dropped by the broadcaster and stated that in fact he thought the show would become stronger. Marquess later stated that he planned on making the serial more commercial to compete to with the other UK soap operas. Marquess then signed another former The Bill actor, Scott Neal, into a regular role and repositioned Cheryl as a central character. An interview on This Morning, an ITV television programme, in September 2010 saw actor Kieron Richardson come out as homosexual and also reveal that a new storyline was being developed in which the character he played, Ste Hay, would embark on a homosexual relationship with Brandan Brady. The same month also saw a considerable number of cast changes. Popular actress Georgina Hale guested as Blanche Longford and Rachel Doherty joined as Eileen Brady Travis Yates also joined the cast in a regular role of Arlo Davenport. Irish actor Drew Dillon also joined the cast. Charlotte Lau played by Amy Yamazaki was unexpectedly written out, after her departure the serial confirmed her final scenes had already aired. Beth Kingston was also revealed to depart as India Longford and short term regular Jem Costello was confirmed to depart after Helen Russel-Clarke finished filming at the end of her contract. On-screen Cindy also left whilst Waring was already on maternity leave. That month another storyline was unveiled which saw Hollyoaks, team up with Channel 4 Education's Battlefront, to explore an underage sex storyline involving twelve-year-old characters Finn O'Connor and Amber Sharpe, which would lead to Amber's pregnancy. Explaining the storyline, Paul Marquess said: \\"Hollyoaks has long been credited for tackling difficult issues that affect young people in a sensitive and intelligent way [...] there will be no fairytale ending for Amber; she is faced with the most difficult situation she could ever imagine.\\" In September 2010 it was announced that actor Darren Day had been cast as new character Danny Houston, described as a gangster who would \\"spell trouble for Jacqui\\". On 23 October 2010 Hollyoaks celebrated 15 years of broadcasting, Digital Spy wished them happy birthday, as did The Guardian. It was later announced that Marquess was implenting a dramatic fire plot which would kill of a host of characters. Channel 4 promoted the storyline with a trailer broadcast during October 2010 to advertise the show's \\"fire week\\", and it was revealed that episodes would feature different characters in each episode set around the events of Guy Fawkes Night, in which an arsonist would set fire to Il Gnosh. India was killed off in a storyline highlighting the dangers of online dating. Marquess then decided to rewrite previous storyline and bring back character Warren Fox from the dead. Mandy was also reintroduced after Dunn agreed to return. Marquess was also unhappy with the quality of the episodes so began to refilm certain episodes just before they were due to transmit. It was announced in January 2011 that Marquess would leave his role as series producer and would be succeeded by Hollyoaks production team member Gareth Philips. Discussing the news, Philips said: \\"I have really enjoyed working in the script team at Hollyoaks and it will be a huge honour to take the reins of Channel 4's flagship youth drama. I am very excited about taking the show even further this year with more compelling and brave stories.\\" The new year saw the return of characters such as Suzanne, Amy, Doug and Gaz. Anna Shaffer joined the cast as Ruby Button. Anita Roy was then written out following the return of Gaz.

It was first broadcast on BBC One and BBC HD on 8 August 2010. This episode introduced the character of Jim Moriarty, the \\"consulting criminal\\". It featured a number of linked cases for Sherlock to solve, with numerous allusions to the works of Arthur Conan Doyle. Critical reception was highly positive.  Plot  Sherlock Holmes is bored without any interesting cases. Mycroft Holmes urges Sherlock to investigate the death of Secret Intelligence Service clerk Andrew West and the disappearance of a flash drive containing missile plans. Sherlock refuses, and is called to Scotland Yard where he receives a mobile phone matching the victim's from \\"A Study in Pink\\". The phone shows a photo of trainers, and a hostage calls: if Sherlock cannot solve the puzzle in twelve hours, a bomb will kill her. Sherlock traces the trainers to Carl Powers, a schoolboy who reportedly drowned in a swimming pool. Proving the boy was poisoned with botulinum toxin via his eczema medication, Sherlock announces the solution to the bomber and the hostage is freed. A second MMS shows a blood-stained sports car; another hostage phones, saying Sherlock has eight hours to solve this mystery. Finding the car without its driver, Sherlock interviews the missing man's wife and the car rental boss, whom he deduces was recently in Colombia. After learning that the blood in the car had been frozen, Sherlock announces that the missing man paid the agency owner to help him disappear, and the hostage is freed. A third message and hostage point Sherlock to the death of Connie Prince, who allegedly died from tetanus. Sherlock disproves the cause of death, and Watson interviews Prince's brother Kenny; Sherlock pins the crime on the housekeeper Raoul de Santos‚ÄîKenny's lover‚Äîwho murdered Connie by increasing her botox injection. Despite Sherlock solving the puzzle, the hostage is killed for describing the kidnapper. The fourth message is a photograph of the River Thames, and no hostage calls; Sherlock and the police discover security guard Alex Woodbridge's body on the riverbank. Sherlock claims that Woodbridge was strangled by an assassin called the \\"Golem\\" using his bare hands. After tracing Woodbridge's interest in astronomy, Sherlock deduces that the guard had uncovered a forged Johannes Vermeer painting about to be exhibited. While Sherlock examines the painting, a child hostage calls: Sherlock has ten seconds to prove the forgery. He spots a supernova in the painting that post-dates Vermeer, thus stopping the bomb. The museum curator confesses the forgery and outs her accomplice: a man named \\"Moriarty\\". Lacking a fifth message, Watson investigates West's death, and Sherlock discovers it to be the fifth mystery. They find West's prospective brother-in-law, Joe Harrison, who confesses to stealing the flash drive and accidentally killing West in an argument; unable to sell it, Harrison still has the drive. Sherlock uses the device to lure Moriarty, but instead Watson arrives as the fifth hostage, wearing an explosive vest. Moriarty appears, and is revealed to have met Sherlock and Watson earlier while masquerading as a Scotland Yard IT tech. He orders Sherlock to stop interfering in his crimes, but Sherlock refuses, and Moriarty leaves. As Sherlock takes off Watson's vest, Moriarty returns (having changed his mind) with multiple snipers targeting both Sherlock and Watson. Sherlock aims his handgun at the explosive vest, intending mutual assured destruction.  Sources and allusions  As with all episodes of Sherlock, the plot combines those of a number of works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. * Sherlock's surprising ignorance, discussed on John's blog, about several commonplace subjects including astronomy, comes from A Study in Scarlet, as does Holmes' annoyance about ordinary people filling their minds with useless subjects. * Andrew West, the name of the MI6 clerk, comes from \\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\\".  Production  According to the DVD commentary, \\"The Great Game\\" was the first episode of Sherlock to be produced after the BBC accepted the series. The series was filmed in reverse order because co-creator Steven Moffat, the writer of the first episode \\"A Study in Pink\\", was busy with the fifth series of Doctor Who. Andrew Scott made his first appearance as Jim Moriarty in \\"The Great Game\\". Moffat said, \\"We knew what we wanted to do with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho.\\" Moffat and Gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation between Moriarty and Sherlock into the first three episodes, but realised that they \\"just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in 'The Final Problem' in which the two arch-enemies meet each other.\\" Sherlock's residence at 221B Baker Street was filmed at 185 North Gower Street. Baker Street was impractical because of heavy traffic and the number of things labelled \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", which would need to be disguised. The laboratory used by Sherlock was filmed at Cardiff University School of Earth and Ocean Sciences. \\"The Great Game\\" was partly set in a disused sewage works.  Broadcast and reception  \\"The Great Game\\" was first broadcast on BBC One on 8 August 2010. Overnight figures had been watched by 7.34 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD, a 31.3% audience share. Final viewing figures rose to 9.18 million. Critical reception was highly positive. Chris Tilly of IGN rated \\"The Great Game\\" a 9.5 out of 10, describing it as \\"gripping from start to finish\\". Of Moriarty's appearance, he said it \\"didn't disappoint either, the villain of the piece being unlike any incarnation of the character yet seen on screen\\". He also praised the writing, saying, \\"Credit should go to writer Mark Gatiss, his script the perfect combination of classic Conan Doyle storytelling with modern-day plot devices and humour, creating a sophisticated mystery that was the perfect marriage of old and new.\\", and the performances of Cumberbatch and Freeman. John Teti, writing for The A.V. Club, awarded the episode an A- and called it an \\"extraordinarily dense 90 minutes\\". He further singled out Andrew Scott for praise, writing that his \\"portrayal of Moriarty is a thrilling departure from earlier incarnations of the man\\". The Guardian Sam Wollaston was optimistic for the programme, describing it as \\"smart, exciting, and just the right level of confusing\\" and described \\"The Great Game\\" as \\"a mash-up that totally works\\" and \\"an edge-of-the seat ride\\".

Objectives  The EPTA partners advise parliaments on the possible social, economic and environmental impact of new sciences and technologies. The common aim is to provide impartial and high quality analysis and reports of developments in issues such as for example bioethics and biotechnology, public health, environment and energy, ICTs, and R&D; policy. Such work is seen as an aid to the democratic control of scientific and technological innovations, and was pioneered in the 1970s by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) of the US Congress. EPTA aims to advance the establishment of technology assessment (TA) as an integral part of policy formation in parliamentary decision-making processes in Europe, and to strengthen the links between TA units in Europe.  History and organization  The EPTA network was formally established in 1990, on a recommendation by the UK's parliamentary TA office ‚Äì Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, under the patronage of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Enrique Baron Crespo. The network has a light structure, guided by the EPTA Council and by meetings of the Directors of the EPTA partner organizations. The EPTA Council is the steering committee of the EPTA network, and consists of Members of Parliament or representatives of the advisory boards for the respective EPTA organization. The Council decides on organizational matters such as co-operation within the network and the status of members and associates. The Presidency of EPTA rotates among full members each year. The tasks of the EPTA member organization holding the presidency are to coordinate the EPTA network activities and to host the annual EPTA conference, Council meeting and Directors' meeting.  Members  Parliamentary TA is institutionalized in different ways, ranging from permanent parliamentary committees for TA; separate TA units as part of the parliamentary administration; to independent institutions with a mandate to serve as a permanent consulting institution for the parliament. The members of the EPTA network are European organizations, which carry out TA studies on behalf of parliaments. Full membership can be obtained by a unit that operates in Europe, is devoted to TA or related activities, serves a (supra-national, national or regional) parliament, has its own budget and secretariat and has an active work program including publications on issues with a scientific and technological component. Associate membership can be granted to other TA units that have a TA program and the resources to realize it, but that do not fulfill other criteria for full membership. Associates are involved in all EPTA activities but are not represented in the EPTA Council. Further, other units interested in the work of EPTA can act as observers.

He is one of the earliest characters to be associated with Arthur and appears in a number of texts, including Culhwch ac Olwen, Geraint fab Erbin, Iarlles y Ffynnon, Pa Gur yv y Porthur and the Welsh Triads. Role in Welsh tradition =Culhwch ac Olwen, and Pa Gur yv y Porthaur= After being cursed by his stepmother such that he may marry no one but Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden, Culhwch ap Cilydd seeks assistance from his cousin Arthur to win her hand in marriage. He arrives at his court at Celliwig but is denied by the Glewlwyd, the chief porter. Culhwch threatens to wreak havoc unless he is granted entry to the court and, eventually, Glewlwyd relents. In a bombastic speech given in this tale, Glewlwyd recounts his history to Arthur, in which he claims to have been in different exotic locations across the world and Otherworld, often alongside Arthur: Culhwch entering Arthur's Court in the Welsh tale Culhwch and Olwen, 1881 This passage is closely related to the narrative of the tenth-century poem ; \\"What man is the porter,\\" in which Glewlwyd is the titular gatekeeper of fortress to which Arthur and his men are seeking admittance. To prove their right of entry Arthur relates the feats and achievements of his men; particularly those of Cai and Bedwyr. Later on in Culhwch ac Olwen, Glewlwyd leads his servants during the hunt for the man-turned-boar, Twrch Trwyth, and three of them, Huandaw, Gogigwr and Penpingion, are killed in the process, mortally wounded by the quarry. Glewlwyd is left with Llaesgymyn, \\"a man who was no use to anyone\\" as his sole remaining servant. Gantz, Jeffrey. The Mabinogion. =Other appearances= Glewlwyd is named twice in the Welsh Triads. He is listed as one of the twenty-four ordained knights of Arthur's court and is regarded as one of the \\"Three Offensive Knights of Arthur‚Äôs Court\\", alongside Sanddef and Morfran. They are known as the offensive knights because it is \\"repugnant to anyone to refuse them anything: Sanddef because of his beauty, Morfran because of his ugliness, and Glewlwyd because of his size and his strength and his ferocity.\\" He is further named as the lover of Dyfyr Golden-Hair, one of the Three Famous Maidens of Arthur's Court.(Davies, Sioned. The Mabinogion, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 254.) In The Lady of the Fountain, the tale of the knight Owain, Glewlwyd is present at Arthur's court at Caerleon, once again in the role of gatekeeper, \\"greeting guests and foreigners, beginning to honour them, telling them the customs and habits of the court, and informing those who had the right to go to the hall or chamber or who merited lodging.\\"Gantz, Jeffrey. The Mabinogion. In the romance of Geraint fab Erbin, Glewlwyd is once again chief gatekeeper at Caerleon, although it is stated \\"he did not trouble himself over this service except on one of the three important festivals.\\"Gantz, Jeffrey. The Mabinogion. During the rest of the year, his duties are shared by his seven assistants: Gryn, Penpingion, Llaesgymyn, Gogyfwlch, Gwrddnei Cat-Eye, Drem ap Dremidydd and Clust fab Clusfeinydd. Glewlwyd is further mentioned in satirical fifteenth or sixteenth parody, Araith Iolo Goch, in which a certain \\"amorous-mannered, grief-pallored, pale-cheeked youth\\" from Gwynedd seeks the heart of a maiden from Powys. In a conversation between the lady and her suitor, Glewlwyd's great strength is alluded to. Glewlwyd is described as \\"the man who lifted the cauldron down from the fire with one hand in the court of Toron of the three islands of Britain, with the sliced meat of seven oxen boiling in it\\".

In the German-speaking countries it is the only institution of higher education exclusively specialized in the study of philosophy.  History  Founded as a seminary at Pullach in 1925 by Augustin Bea, first named the Berchmanskolleg, it obtained the ability to issue a doctorate in 1932. In 1971 the school moved to central Munich and opened to non-Jesuit students. The majority of students are not members of the Jesuit Order, and now include women and international students. It is accredited by the Bavarian State Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts (in German: Bayerisches Staatsministerium f√ºr Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst). Since 2009, the Munich School of Philosophy hosts the yearly Rahner Lecture in memory of the German Jesuit and theologian Karl Rahner.  Philosophical tradition  Most faculty members are Jesuits. The school has long stood in the tradition of Neo-Scholasticism. Only since the 1970s, when the school opened to non-Jesuit students, contemporary philosophy such as marxism, phenomenology and analytic philosophy have gained more prominence in the undergraduate and postgraduate education. To date, the undergraduate curriculum at the Munich School of Philosophy places much emphasis on the history of philosophy and issues pertaining to the study of religion. As a Jesuit school, its objectives and purpose must be in accord with the apostolic constitution Sapientia Christiana, Art. 79 and 80 in research and teaching: # to promote the study of philosophy and its history; # to reflect systematically on fundamental issues of religious faith and to elucidate the affiliation between philosophy and theology; # to analyze and develop the contributions of other sciences towards philosophy; # to apply the insights gained from these theoretical endeavors to practical concerns of human and social life.  Notable alumni and faculty members  = Faculty = Harald Lesch is a German physicist, astronomer, natural philosopher, author, television presenter, and professor of physics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) and lecturer of natural philosophy at the Munich School of Philosophy. = Alumni = Notable alumni include former minister- president of Baden-W√ºrttemberg Erwin Teufel and German politician and CDU party member Heiner Gei√üler.  Research centers  The Munich School of Philosophy has six distinctive research centers: * Institute for Social and Development Studies (German: Institut f√ºr Gesellschaftspolitik/IGP) * Institute for Communications and Media Research (German: Institut f√ºr Kommunikationswissenschaft und Erwachsenenp√§dagogik/IKE) * Institute for Philosophy of Religion (German: Institut f√ºr Religionsphilosophie/IRP) * Institute for Scientific Issues related to Philosophy and Theology (German: Institut f√ºr naturwissenschaftliche Grenzfragen zur Philosophie und Theologie/ING) * Institute for Philosophy and Leadership (German: Institut f√ºr Philosophie und Leadership) * Rottendorf Project (German: Rottendorf Projekt)  Rankings  The Munich School of Philosophy is currently not ranked in any major university web rankings due to its specialization in philosophy. It frequently cooperates with faculty members of two Munich universities, the Technical University and the Ludwig Maximilian University which are both consistently ranked among Germany's foremost universities.

Formed in 2008, the duo departed from the musical template of the UK dubstep scene, releasing early EPs Maybes and Sketch on Glass to critical praise the following year. Their debut album Crooks & Lovers in 2010 received further acclaim and was listed as one the defining albums of the decade by of DJ Mag. The band signed with Warp Records in 2012, and released their second album Cold Spring Fault Less Youth the following year and third album Love What Survives in September 2017. They have collaborated with artists such as James Blake, King Krule, and Micachu. History =Early years: 2008‚Äì2011= Kai Campos is originally from St. Austell in Cornwall, while Dom Maker is from Brighton. They met at Southbank University in London, where Campos was attending university for the second time and Maker was studying film. They started making music together at a home studio in Peckham. Arguably responsible for inspiring the term \\"post-dubstep\\", the duo released a series of acclaimed early EPs, including Maybes and Sketch on Glass, that expanded beyond the dubstep sound. The band's debut album, entitled Crooks & Lovers, was released on 19 June 2010 in the UK to critical acclaim. At the end of 2010, Crooks & Lovers was included in over thirty 'Best of 2010' lists, including NME, Mixmag, Resident Advisor, Pitchfork, Drowned in Sound, NME listed them at number 22 in their 30 Artists For 2011. In 2010, Mount Kimbie toured the UK, Europe and America. They were also involved in the festival circuit playing at The Great Escape Festival, Stag & Dagger festival, Glade Festival, Field Day Festival and Bestival amongst others. The duo were then invited to perform at Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Awards event in February 2011. In March and April 2011, they embarked on a US tour which included performances at SXSW and Coachella. They also toured in Australia in March, selling out all six of their performances, with Australia's The Vine saying of their Melbourne performance, \\"They flesh out skeletal elements of tracks with alternative instrumentation, or accentuate features with subtle additions or substitutions. In this way much of the material aired tonight is invigoratingly bolstered, altered or augmented in some way. It makes for a stimulating performance.\\" However, regarding a live realisation of Crooks & Lovers in Glasgow in early 2011 The Guardian said that \\"presenting such short tunes as standalone pieces when they might function better threaded together gives the set a disjointed feel.\\" The pair are closely linked to friend, producer and BBC Sound of 2011 runner-up, James Blake. He has collaborated with them live and lent his skills to the remixing of \\"Maybes\\" which features on the Mount Kimbie EP Remixes Part 1, released 12 April 2010, as well as contributing elements to Crooks & Lovers. They've also featured on his BBC Radio 1 residency. Mount Kimbie have produced remixes for The Big Pink, Foals, The xx and Andreya Triana. =Warp: 2012‚Äìpresent= Mount Kimbie signed to Warp Records in June 2012. The group toured North America that year with Squarepusher. Tony Kus joined the duo as their live drummer from October 2012 to 2015. Since 2016, Marc Pell of Micachu and the Shapes and Andrea Balency have joined Mount Kimbie's live show on drums and keyboards. They released their second album Cold Spring Fault Less Youth in 2013. Mount Kimbie performed a full tour across the US and Europe in late 2013 to tie in with the launch of the album. In September 2015, Mount Kimbie hosted a weekly residency every Tuesday, throughout September, with London based online radio station NTS Radio. The shows included guests such as James Blake, William Basinski and King Krule. In July 2016, Mount Kimbie announced they would be taking a break from recording and be heading out on the road. Playing a small number of European shows including Pitchfork Music Festival. In 2016 Chance the Rapper sampled 'Adriatic' from their 2010 debut album on his mixtape Coloring Book on the track Juke Jam featuring Justin Bieber and Towkio. A second 'transatlantic' NTS residency took place across April and May 2017, broadcasting out of both London and Los Angeles, and once again featuring guests including James Blake, Archy Marshall, Actress and Warpaint. On 3 April 2017, Mount Kimbie released a new track, \\"We Go Home Together\\" on Warp Records, featuring long time collaborator James Blake. This was followed by another new track, \\"Marilyn\\", featuring Micachu. The track was accompanied by a music video by fashion photographer Mark Lebon, featuring Lebon's sons, Tyrone and Frank, both of whom have previously collaborated with Mount Kimbie. On 12 July 2017, Mount Kimbie announced that they would be releasing their third album, Love What Survives, on 8 September 2017. Alongside this they released a new track, \\"Blue Train Lines\\" featuring King Krule. Love What Survives featured contributions from King Krule, James Blake, Micachu and Andrea Balency. The album received strongly positive reviews upon release; DIY gave the album a 4/5 review, describing it as \\"the most affecting work to date by some stretch\\", and Mixmag called the album \\"searingly brilliant\\" and rated it 8/10. Pitchfork rated the album 8.4/10, selecting it as their \\"Best New Music\\", as well ranking the album at 34th in their 50 Best Albums of 2017 list. Mount Kimbie toured extensively across the world in 2017 and 2018 to support the album, including festival appearances at Pitchfork Music Festival, Primavera Sound Festival, Field Day and Electric Picnic. On 9 August 2018, Mount Kimbie's compilation release as part of the DJ Kicks series was announced, featuring an original production by the duo titled \\"Southgate\\". In 2019 they released a four track live recording of the Warp NTS live session. In the same year they were commissioned by Adidas Originals to produce music for a new campaign. Style Mount Kimbie's early work drew from the contemporary UK dubstep scene while expanding beyond its typical scope. The Guardian described the pair as \\"leading an exploratory breakaway from bass- heavy dubstep towards a lighter, hazier style of electronica rich with drowsy ambience and chopped-up found sounds.\\" According to Resident Advisor, in their work \\"dubstep is unraveled and reassembled from its brawny rhythms upward, connecting the dots between musique concr√®te, R&B;, hip-hop, drone and the midnight gospel sounds of Burial.\\" In 2009, Pitchfork Media described their music as making use of \\"sped-up vocal samples, little tunnels of ambience, unimposing synth patches, and syncopated percussion that sounds like someone putting away the silverware,\\" clarifying that \\"their rhythms are still dubstep in DNA-- deftly syncopated, slightly off-center, ambiguously danceable-- but most of what they lay on top of the beat sounds like it's being dragged out from places dubstep usually doesn't go: R&B;, post-rock, IDM\\". The duo use field recordings to form major elements of their music. \\"It‚Äôs amazing what you can pick up with a field microphone. I mean, you might just hear someone riding around but when you slow it down it‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs a beat to it. And then just taking little pockets of that rhythm and stretching it out. A lot of what we do is about experimenting with different little bits of tone that you don‚Äôt necessarily hear on the first listen... and then trying to make songs out of them.\\"  Solo Work  = Kai Campos = In 2018 Kai curated a techno-driven DJ-Kicks mix and has been DJing consistently ever since, including a b2b tour with Actress and headline sets at Printworks and Fabric. = Dom Maker = Dominic Maker now lives in L.A. where he has produced for artists such as Jay-Z, Slowthai and James Blake.

Biography  Boutens was born in Middelburg. He grew up in Zeeland in a strict, Protestant middle-class environment. After finishing the Gymnasium Middelburg, he began to study classical languages in 1890 at the University of Utrecht, and graduated in 1899 on a study of the Greek comedy writer Aristophanes. Portrait by Jan Toorop (1905) His debut as a poet was the Utrecht Student Almanac in 1891. His early work was inspired by the verses of Herman Gorter; later sources of inspiration were Plato, Sappho and the Bible. Boutens' style became based on the idea of achieving a \\"higher reality\\". In the course of 45 years, he published some 20 volumes of poetry, but also a large number of translations of Ancient Greek (i.a. Ilias and Odyssey), Persian, French, German and English poets. In 1894 he accepted the post of teacher of classical languages at the Noorthey boarding school for boys in Voorschoten, at the time a renowned institute for young people from aristocratic families. After a physical collapse in 1904 and a subsequent holiday in Tyrol, he settled in The Hague, where he earned his living by private tuition and the financial support of some aristocratic friends he had met at Noorthey. Boutens became a member of the Association of Writers (founded in 1905), and became its president in 1918. In the last year of his life, during the German occupation in World War II, he also became a member of the Gleichschaltung professional artists' association, the Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer. This taint did not hinder his posthumous fame as a poet and translator: his voluminous collected works were successively published in seven volumes from 1943-1954. In the 1980s his homosexuality was disclosed. A volume of poetry about homosexual love he had published in 1919 as a work of a poet who had prematurely died, the Strofen van Andries de Hoghe turned out to be Boutens's own work.

This issue remains a subject under constant revision, with the intention of providing recommendations based on sound scientific evidence. In the past, bacteremia caused by dental procedures (in most cases due to viridans streptococci, which reside in oral cavity), such as a cleaning or extraction of a tooth was thought to be more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of August 2018 due to new SDCEP advice in line with the NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current AHA guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians and patients.  Guidelines  Currently, there are official guidelines for dental antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis and of infection of prosthetic joint. These guidelines are in constant controversy and revisions by various professional committees. In addition, there are various medical conditions for which clinicians recommended antibiotic prophylaxis, although there is no evidence to support this practice. These conditions include renal dialysis shunt, cerebrospinal fluid shunt, vascular graft, immunosuppression secondary to cancer and cancer chemotherapy, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is of importance to dental patients and practitioners to remain current with regards to the latest recommendations rendered by professional governing bodies such as the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP), American Dental Association (ADA), American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Association of Orthopaedic surgeons (AAOS). Antibiotic prophylaxis is intended to avoid adverse outcomes in certain patients at \\"highest risk of postoperative complications.\\" Standard antibiotic regimens are routinely prescribed and taken before dental procedures to avoid systemic complications secondary to the transient bacteremia caused by manipulation of the oral tissues. Although the ADA, in collaboration with AHA and AAOS have published guidelines specifying those patients who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis, research continues to further define the role dental treatment may play in causing adverse outcomes in these patients.  Recommendations  The Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) had published recommendations in this scope (August 2018) for the dental team on how best to adhere to the guidelines by NICE. These recommendations have been recognised and acknowledged by NICE in July 2018. The recommendations aim to clarify circumstances and management when patients are not within the scope of NICE's guideline on antibiotic prophylaxis. * Considerations should be undertaken by healthcare professional as well to exercise their clinical judgement and patient's consent in decision-making. Infective Endocarditis (IE) is the infection of heart valves. Previous beliefs were held that IE can be induced from dental procedures due to the invasive nature of treatment, therefore antibiotics were widely prescribed before dental treatment to prevent this. This belief has changed with evidence to show that the risk of IE occurrence from everyday routine such as toothbrushing and eating is the same as that of undergoing invasive dental procedure. Increasing concerns regarding rise in antibiotic resistance have also pushed for change in advice on antibiotic prophylaxis, where the British National Formulary (BNF) has now opposed the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry. * Unsatisfactory evidence to conclude whether antibiotic prophylaxis is useful in patients at risk of IE before dental treatment. It is now established that ‚ÄòAntibiotic prophylaxis against IE is not recommended routinely for people undergoing dental procedures‚Äô according to NICE 2016, recommendation 1.1.3. = Group of patients with higher risks = Only a selected body of patients are categorized with a more significant risk of IE who might require antibiotic prophylaxis. These patients undergo non-routine management. * Prosthetic valves which include a transcatheter value, or those with prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair * Previous incidence of IE * Congenital heart disease (CHD) - any type of cyanotic CHD, or any type of CHD repaired with a prosthetic material (via surgical or percutaneous techniques) ** Up to 6 months after procedure or lifelong if residual shunt or valvular regurgitation remains [Table adapted from SDCEP AB Prophylaxis against IE] = Management of patients =  High risk  Check patient's cardiac condition and determine whether they belong in the selected body of patients who are at a more significant risk of IE. If they do, the dentist should consult with the patient's cardiologist regarding antibiotic cover before dental treatment. Antibiotic cover is only considered when undergoing invasive dental procedures. * If no antibiotic cover is needed, manage the patient as if they were at normal risk of IE * If antibiotic cover is needed, discuss with the patient about pros & cons of antibiotic prophylaxis to obtain informed consent about their management. Educate patient about the importance and relevance of good oral hygiene and infective endocarditis * Significance of adequate oral hygiene * Link between risk of IE & dental procedures or other invasive procedures * Identify & have awareness of early signs/symptoms of infective endocarditis * Know when to seek help/treatment when IE suspected Review any patients with significant risk of IE if they develop a dental infection, and manage without delay to minimize risk of IE development.  Normal or no risk  Dental treatment commenced without antibiotic cover. Patients need to be informed regarding their cardiac condition and infective endocarditis, and how this may affect dental treatment. * Discussion of pros & cons of antibiotic prophylaxis, why it is not generally advocated * Significance of adequate oral hygiene * Link between risk of IE & dental procedures or other invasive procedures * Identify & have awareness of early signs/symptoms of infective endocarditis * Know when to seek help/treatment when IE suspected If patients are insistent on antibiotic prophylaxis, consult the patient's cardiologist before proceeding.  Children with cardiac conditions  Children with cardiac conditions have the same risks of IE as an adult patient. Difference in management lies with gaining consent where Gillick competence comes into play. A child may lack cooperation for dental procedures in which case, they may be considered to be referred for dental treatment under sedation or general anaesthetic.  Emergency patients with cardiac conditions  Check patient's cardiac condition and determine whether they belong in the selected body of patients who are at a more significant risk of IE. Consulting with a local cardiology centre or the patient's cardiologist may be appropriate. Manage infections without delay to minimise risk of IE development.  Prescribing antibiotics  * It should be clear on the prescription that the antibiotics serve as prophylaxis * Inform patients about the risks and possible side effects on prescribed drugs, how to seek help if side effects occur * Inform patients on appropriate use of antibiotics (duration, time, route of administration)  See also  * Infective endocarditis * Preventive medicine * Oral medicine  References   External links  *Dental SEO Experts Category:Dentistry ","title":"Dental antibiotic prophylaxis"},{"id":"28300733","text":"Alem is a town in the Dutch province of Gelderland.

Ref: cf. Suet. Nero, 31. footnote 2: It appears to have been the custom, under the Empire, for all theatres and other places of amusement to be provided with perfumed fountains and concealed jets for cooling the air with a fine spray of scented water.Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898) AmphitheƒÅtrum There were in the amphitheatre concealed tubes, from which scented liquids were scattered over the audience, and which sometimes issued from statues placed in different parts of the building. (Lucan, ix. 808; Spect. 3.) The overhead awning (velarium) shielding the spectators for the Colosseum was saturated with scented water for dripping fragrant water on spectators' heads to keep them cool.Papillon, p. 200 The awning shielding the amphitheatre was saturated with scented water which dripped, like a fragrant rain, on the spectators' heads.DICTIONARY OF GREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITIES, p. 53 There were in the amphitheatres concealed tubes, from which scented liquids were scattered over the audience...Smith Amphitheatrum They were protected from the sun and the rain by an ample canopy, occasionally drawn over their heads. The air was continually refreshed by the playing of fountains, and profusely impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics.Smith Amphitheatrum but the velarium, or awning, by which the spectators were sheltered from the sun, requires some explanation, which will be found under Velum. The space required for the working of the velarium, and the height necessary for keeping it from bending down by its own weight so low as to obstruct the view from the upper benches, are probably the reasons for the great disproportion between the height of the upper part of the amphitheatre, and the small number of spectators accommodated in that part. The luxurious appliances of fountains of scented water to refresh the spectators, and so forth, are sufficiently described in the passage already quoted from Gibbon (cf. Lucan IX.808).¬∫  Perfume  Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland in 1511-12 had various scented waters made for him, which consisted of his usage of over a gallon each week for the year.Woolgar, p. 140 In the 1571 estate inventory of John Brodocke, an apothecary in Southampton, lists 32 types of scented water that he had as some of the items in his shop.Woolgar, p. 271 In 17th century Constantinople the Venetians and Genoese had apothecary shops that had merchants of scented water including rose water.Donkin, p. 32 Scented waters were still being used into the 19th century of the wealthy nobles in Egypt as a type of perfume. It was an Egyptian custom then to sprinkle guests with rose water or orange-flower water after dinner just before they were to go home. Even though it is said by scholars that the art of perfumery has it roots in antiquity, the city of Montpellier has self established itself as the birthplace of perfumery. In the 18th century they honored guests of the city with scented water and other 'gifts of fragrance'. There are even perfume manuals that describe Montpellier perfumes as being \\"a la mode de Montpellier\\" because of extra ingredients used that enhance their fragrances.Feydeau, p. 8  Cooking  Scented rose water is and has been used from time to time for cooking and flavoring foods in various recipes.Lyttelton, p. 109 Rose water is used in Greek cuisine.  Sensual  In Medieval times scented water was used for sensual pleasures.  Religious  In Medieval times scented water was used at baptisms.Lyttelton, p. 127  Formulas  = Rose water = Mary Hooper in her book called Petals in the Ashes about the Great Fire of 1666 explains that the first step in making \\"rose water\\" is to gather together 3 or 4 full roses. These roses should not have been treated in any way with toxic pesticide for obvious reasons. One is to then take a pint of water and put into a saucepan. Then heat the water with the roses in it gently, not allowing it to boil. You are to cook the rose petals until they become transparent. After that happens, allow the cooked rose water to cool. Then drain through a sieve forcing the water to go through the rose petals. The resulting \\"rose water\\" is to be refrigerated. The scented water then is used as a cooling agent on the body as well as the face.Hooper, p. 191 = Scented bath water = Hooper explains that scented water to bathe in can be made of dried herbs. She explains the idea of making such a scented water is to put 8 tablespoons of dried herbs in a pan of 1 pint of water and simmer for 10 minutes. This water then is to be allowed to cool. Then it is to be strained to remove all the herb pieces. For the actual bath then a quarter of this scented water is to be put into your bath, highlighted with fresh flower petals on top of the bath water. She explains roses and lovage have a cleansing and deodorising effect. For a refreshing effect she recommends to use rosemary and hyssop. For a relaxing effect to use lime flowers and lavender. For a soothing effect use chamomile and lemon balm.Hooper, p. 193  Footnotes   Primary sources  * French, John, Art of Distillation, 1653 * Plat, Hugh, Delightes for Ladies 1594 * Markham, Gervase, English Housewife, 1615  Secondary sources  * Adamson, Melitta Weiss, Food in medieval times, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, * Baer, Eva, Metalwork in medieval Islamic art, SUNY Press, 1983, * Bober, Phyllis Pray, Art, Culture, and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy , University of Chicago Press, 2001, *Boeser, Knut, The elixirs of Nostradamus: Nostradamus' original recipes for elixirs, scented water, beauty potions, and sweetmeats, Moyer Bell, 1996; * Books, Storey, Country Wisdom & Know-How: Everything You Need to Know to Live Off the Land, Black Dog Publishing, 2004, * DICTIONARY OF GREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITIES, 1886, Original from Harvard University * Donkin, R.

The neighborhood is the result of a vast real-estate project launched by the Quebec government in the late 1990s which redeveloped abandoned nineteenth century industrial buildings into a business cluster for information technology companies. Groupe Cardinal Hardy and Groupe Provencher & Roy architectes collaborated on the district's urban design. History The Soci√©t√© de D√©veloppement de Montr√©al possessed land holdings dating back to the Dor√© administration's failed Quartier des R√©cluses initiative, in which lands were bought by the SIMPA to make way for the project. In exchange for handing this over, the SDM gained a minority stake in a joint venture with the real estate arms of the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec (CDPQ) and the FTQ Fonds de Solidarit√© to fund the construction of the Cit√©, which occurred in eight phases, with additional phases having been planned. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois Bouchard Government of Qu√©bec then gave payroll tax credits to employers for moving to the new Cit√© du Multim√©dia buildings. After the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and the elimination of tax incentives for information technology jobs in the district by the Liberal government of Jean Charest in 2003, phase 9 and others were cancelled, and the structures were sold by the joint venture to the private sector. Economy Many high-tech companies are still located in the area, while phase 8 is occupied by the municipal government. The property values in this part of Montreal are very high. The neighbourhood has 6,000 workers, and an average salary of $73,000 per year. This figure is almost 25% above Montr√©al's average. Controversy Then-finance minister Bernard Landry had been criticized by members of Montreal's real-estate community and some high- tech entrepreneurs when Finance Ministry programs enticed companies to relocate to Cit√© Multim√©dia and the Cit√© du commerce √©lectronique downtown in order to receive tax assistance. In response, Landry announced the creation of CDTIs located in mid-sized cities throughout Quebec, and later the installation of technology clusters in rural areas, such as the Technoparc Rolland in Sainte-Ad√®le, Quebec. The Cit√© du Multim√©dia was also put under investigation in the context of the Charbonneau commission inquiries. In 2019, the Cit√© du Multim√©dia was under controversy again when Montreal Mayor Valerie Plate proposed naming the Griffintown REM station \\"Griffintown-Bernard-Landry\\" due to its proximity to the Cit√© du Multim√©dia. This sparked outrage from Montreal's Irish community, who were reeling at the time due to a Famine cemetery disturbance at the Black Rock by the REM, who disinterred over 15 skeletons to insert a monorail pylon into the burial ground. The international media reaction was very negative, but the Mayor refused to back down.

These include Adloun, Chekka Jdid√©, El-Masloukh, Ksar Akil, Nahr Ibrahim and Naame.Kipfer, 2000, pp. 623, 632, 637, 647, 655. Byblos is a well- known archaeological site, a Phoenician seaport, where the tomb of Ahiram and the other Byblian royal inscriptions were found. An ancient Phoenician inscription on the tomb dates to between the 13th and 10th centuries BCE.Wedgeworth, 1993, p. 453. Byblos, as well as archaeological sites in Baalbek, Tyre, Sidon, and Tripoli, contain artifacts indicating the presence of libraries dating back to the period of Classical antiquity. Industry names Lower paleolithic industries of Lebanon have shown similarities to Chelleo-Acheulean, Acheulean, Tayacian (the Tabunian of Francis Clark Howell), Tayacio-Levalloisian and Early Levalloisian with some caution suggested to be observed with the use of some early Levalloisian and Acheulean labels that may be confused with the Heavy Neolithic of the Qaraoun culture. Middle paleolithic industries suggested include Amudian (Pre-Aurignacian), early Yabrudian, (Acheulio-Yabrudian), Yarbrudian, Micro-Levalloisian or Micro- Mousterian, Levalloisian, Mousterian and Levalloiso-Mousterian. Radio-carbon dating exists for Ksar Akil and Ras El Kelb. Various other industries have been judged to be typologically similar to these along with one described by Henri Fleisch in 1962 particular to \\"mountain sites\\" for which the Mayroubian culture has been defined after its type site, Mayrouba.Fleisch, Henri., Les stations pr√©historiques de montagne au Liban, VI' Congr√®s de l'UlSPP (Rome, 1962) R. Neuville and Dorothy Garrod divided the Upper Paleolithic of Lebanon into six stages based on stratified sites in the surrounding area. Stage one has Emirian and transitional varieties, stage two was possibly evidenced at Ksar Akil.Howell, F., Upper Pleistocene Stratigraphy and Early Man in the Levant, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 103, 1959. Stages three and four have been termed Lower and Upper Antelian after the Antelias cave. Stage five is Atlitian, possibly developed from stage four.Garrod, D., The Natufian Culture ; the life and economy of a Mesolithic People of the Near East. Proceedings of the British Academy, vol 43, 1957. Stage six is identified as Kebaran, of which there are many varieties of assemblage based on locality. Several early Neolithic (similar to Neolithic Ancien of Byblos or Amuq A) sites were found by Diana Kirkbride in the Beqaa Valley in 1964 and mentioned by James Mellaart in 1965.Mellaart, James., Earliest Civilizations in the Near East, Thames and Hudson, London, 1965. The Neolithic of Lebanon was divided up into three stages by Maurice Dunand based on the stratified levels of Byblos. The first two stages, \\"N√©olithique Ancien\\" and \\"N√©olithique Moyen\\", were characterized by an economy based on a mixture of hunting and farming whereas \\"N√©olithique R√©cent\\" displayed a shift to agriculture evidenced by fewer arrowheads and more grinding tools and sickle blades. Various other Neolithic industries have been found in Lebanon such as Trihedral Neolithic and Shepherd Neolithic. Henri Fleisch discovered and termed the Shepherd Neolithic flint industry from the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest nomadic shepherds. He dated this industry to the Epipaleolithic or Pre-Pottery Neolithic as it is evidently not Paleolithic, Mesolithic or even Pottery Neolithic.Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Pr√©histoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63. One particularly vigorous culture identified at over forty sites by Jesuit archaeologists in Lebanon is called the Qaraoun culture. This culture existed at the dawn of agriculture without pottery and produced Heavy Neolithic flint tools such as axes and picks to work with lumber, such as the Cedars of Lebanon. Their type site is Qaraoun II, located close to the El Wauroun Dam, Mount Hermon and Aaiha. The Chalcolithic was divided into two periods by Jacques Cauvin based on stratified levels at Byblos; \\"√ân√©olithique Ancien\\" and \\"√ân√©olithique R√©cent\\". The division is marked largely by differences in pottery more than flints with a few notable exceptions such as fan-scrapers. There are a large number of tells in the Beqaa Valley and Akkar Plain which have Early Bronze Age or earlier deposits including one under the Grand Court in front of the Temple of Jupiter in Baalbek.Bulletin du Mus√©e de Beyrouth, Volume 18, 1965. Surveys and dating of prehistoric sites Descriptions of some of the tells in the Beqaa Valley were published by A. Jirku in 1933, L. Burkhalter in 1948 and A. Kuschke in 1954, along with a map of the Beqaa valley by Bernard Geze in 1956 that marked 50 tells.Jirku, A., Neue Forschungen in Syrien und Pal√§stina.

Another major survey of Lebanese tells was carried out between 1965 and 1966 with 88 tells recorded along with numerous surface sites by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe. Materials collected were presented for comment and identification to a 'panel of experts' that included Diana Kirkbride, Jacques Cauvin, Henri de Contenson, Maurice Dunand, Francis Hours, Henri Fleisch, Robert John Braidwood, Ralph Solecki, W.J. van Liere, G.L. Harding, H. Balfet, Olga Tufnell, Brian Gregor and Ziyad Beydoun. Temples of Lebanon Lebanon contains a diverse range of ruins and remains of Ancient Greek and Roman temples. The premier attraction being the complex at Baalbek, including the enormous temple of Jupiter and outstandingly well preserved temple of Bacchus. It is thought that local villages attempted to create similar temples to a diverse range of Gods, leaving ancient shrines and vestiges to be found all around the country-side. This has led to the country itself being described an \\"open-air museum\\". George F. Taylor divided the temples of Lebanon into three groups, one group referred to the Temples of the Lebanese coastal plain to Mount Lebanon, another group as Temples of the Beqaa Valley and another area with a particularly heavy concentration was defined as the Temples of Mount Hermon. Damage to archaeological sites During the 2006 Lebanon war, a number of archaeological sites, including world heritage sites, were damaged as a result of Israeli aerial bombardments in Lebanon. A survey of the damage to sites in Lebanon was launched by UNESCO after the international archaeological community, including the director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, urged an investigation into the effects of bombing on \\"one of the planet's most heritage-rich countries.\\" UNESCO's team of experts found that the most serious damage resulting from the conflict was at the world heritage site of Byblos, where an oil spill resulting from the targeting of fuel tanks at the Jiyeh power plant had stained the stones at the base of the port's two Medieval towers, among other archaeological remains on the seashore. Mounir Bouchenaki, Director-General of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) estimated that it would take twenty-five people eight to ten weeks to manually hand-clean the affected areas, placing the cost of the operation at some 100,000 USD. Temple of Bacchus The mission also found that the main features of the world heritage site of Tyre, such as the Ancient Roman hippodrome and triumphal arch had escaped damage, but that frescoes in a Roman tomb at the site had come loose, likely because of vibrations caused by bombs. It was also reported that the world heritage site of Baalbek was not damaged by bombs, with the exception of the fall of one block of stone and the widening of fissures on the lintels in the temples of Jupiter and Bacchus, likely due to vibrations from nearby bombings. Also damaged by bombs, as noted by the mission, were the souk and some old houses in the Old City of Baalbek that were not part of the property inscribed on the World Heritage List. At a press conference revealing the results of the survey, Fran√ßoise Rivi√®re, UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for Culture, reported on UNESCO's efforts during and after the fighting to draw the attention of both parties to their obligations to spare cultural heritage, as protected by the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, to which both Lebanon and Israel are States Parties. The recent increase in pace of urbanization in Lebanon has raised notable issues in the news regarding the Beirut Hippodrome and a suggested Phoenician port of Beirut. Non-governmental organizations such as the Association for the Protection of Lebanese Heritage have organized public demonstrations and co-operate with cultural activist groups such as Save Beirut Heritage to increase awareness of heritage conservation in the country.

Located in the Modoc National Forest, its elevation is above sea level. It is approximately southwest of Fort Bidwell. Fandango Pass was historically notable for its location as the convergence of two trails, the Applegate and the Lassen, that were traveled by emigrant pioneers between 1846 and 1850. The pass can now be traversed on a section of graded gravel, 1.5 lanes wide. It is closed during winter storms. History The mountain pass was located at a convergence of two trails, the Applegate and the Lassen, that were traveled by emigrant pioneers between 1846 and 1850. The Applegate Trail, originally intended as a less dangerous route to the Oregon Territory, was established in 1846 by the Applegate brothers and Levi Scott, and ran through today's U.S. states of Idaho, Nevada, California, and Oregon. The Lassen Horn Trail was established by Peter Lassen two years later and ran south at Goose Lake towards California Gold Rush mines and settlements. Though the pass was extensively traversed from 1848 until 1853, its importance declined after 1869 with the opening of the Cedar Pass wagon road. To reach the pass, the emigrants had to cross or bypass Upper Alkali Lake in order to reach the Warner Mountains which is located to the west of the lake. The historic cutoff, part of the California Trail, required passing through Rabbithole Springs, crossing the Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon before finally arriving at Surprise Valley, a journey of approximately of desert travel. From here, the trail climbs steeply to reach the pass, gaining about in about . From the summit, the trail descended steeply into the southeast end of Fandango Valley by Goose Lake on the Oregon-California border. The Fandango Pass trail section is visible on the eastern side of the summit. Name The pass, known initially as Lassen's Pass (1857 map) or Lassen Pass (1864 map), was named for Lassen by gold seekers in 1849 who followed the route made by Lassen the previous year. One theory of the name change, from Lassen to Fandango, is that in the 1850s, an Indian massacre may have occurred in the area. The massacre involved a large emigrant train that had camped at the edge of the valley. While the party indulged in a fandango after finding game, grass, and water, it was attacked by Indians. Another theory suggests that Wolverine Rangers camping in the valley found it to be so cold that they burned their wagons for heat and danced a fandango. They named their camp site \\"Fandango Valley\\". Later pioneers who passed the area and saw burned wagons deduced that an Indian massacre had occurred. While the valley, peak and pass were named Fandango in the 1870s, a 1949 map, nonetheless, showed the pass as being named Lassen Horn. Landmark On July 15, 1956, the Fandango Pass section of the Applegate-Lassen Emigrant Trail became California Historical Landmark No. 546. The plaque marker is located east of Highway 395 on Fandango Pass Road (County Road 9).

Undertaken in July 1949, it involved 60 warships from the British, French, Belgian and Dutch navies. A contemporary newsreel described this exercise as involving \\"the greatest assembly of warships since the Battle of Jutland.\\" Command structure The command authority for Exercise Verity was the Western Union. Field Marshal the Viscount Montgomery of Alamein was WUDO's senior officer as Chairman of the Commanders-in-Chief Committee.* Admiral of the Fleet Sir Rhoderick McGrigor, RN, was in overall command of Exercise Verity. At the time of the exercise, Admiral McGrigor was serving as Commander-in-Chief of the British Royal Navy's Home Fleet. Operation The 60-ship fleet gathered in Mount's Bay, near Penzance, prior to setting sail for the Bay of Biscay for the week-long exercise. Field Marshal Montgomery held a reception on board the flagship, the aircraft carrier . Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands sponsored a cocktail party aboard the cruiser HNLMS Tromp. Field Marshal Montgomery stayed on board the Implacable as an observer during the exercise. Submarines, including the highly advanced French boat Roland Morillot, made simulated attacks against convoys and naval formations using dummy torpedoes. The exercise included bombers flying from land-based airfields. French and British carriers also launched air strikes, with Implacable successfully carrying out strike operations against the enemy (\\"White\\") aircraft carrier force led by the light aircraft carriers HMS Theseus and the French Arromanches.Actually sister ships, Arromanches formerly being HMS Colossus Naval bombardment and convoy escort operations were also carried out. Finally, motor torpedo craft of the Belgian Navy joined other Western Union warships to execute mine-sweeping operations in Weymouth Bay. On 4 July the White force aircraft (RAF Lancasters and Dutch fighters) operated searches against the Blue force (escorted by French aircraft and British flying boats) as it approached the Bay of Biscay. Later both naval surface forces combined in a simulated convoy - the aircraft carriers standing in for troopships - with Lancasters, Mitchells and Meteors as air cover. Land based fighters and naval strike aircraft practiced attacks with cannon and rockets against the smaller ships and then against the main force of four carriers, the battleship Anson and supporting destroyers. The same was practiced the morning of the following day.Flight 14 July p32-33 One unusual example of allied cooperation involved the replacement of the outer wing of a Netherlands Sea Fury fighter aircraft that had been damaged by a bird strike. Since the Royal Netherlands Navy did not provide such elaborate spare parts when the aircraft's group deployed to RNAS Culdrose, the damaged Sea Fury received a replacement wing with British markings. Admiral McGrigor summarized the accomplishments of Exercise Verity by noting: \\"The object of these manoeuvres is to show that we are willing and able to work together in case of aggression... I can say straight away that it's been a very great success...\\" Force composition Major naval units included the British battleship ; the British carriers , and ; the French carrier Arromanches; three British and five French cruisers; and 21 \\"destroyers and destroyer escorts\\". Aviation units included Royal Netherlands Air Force with Mitchell medium bombers and Meteor fighters, Royal Netherlands Navy Fireflies and Sea Furies Royal Netherlands Navy at French Maritime Air Force Dornier and Sunderland flying boats and Wellington bombers, operating from Brest and Lorient. Belgium contributed fighter aircraft in \\"a preliminary stage\\". The RAF forces included Avro Lancaster and Avro Lincoln heavy bombers, Sunderland flying boats and Meteor fighters. Overall control was RAF Coastal Command. Implacable carried de Havilland Sea Hornet fighters and Blackburn Firebrand strike aircraft.

At a height of it is the third tallest \\"traditional lighthouse\\" in the world. History Strong currents and many shipwrecks at the tip of Barfleur, the most famous of which being the White Ship, necessitated building a lighthouse at the location. In 1774 a cylindrical granite lighthouse with a stone rectangular main building were built. The lighthouse was topped with a coal fire. It was first lit on November 1, 1775, and was originally called Phare de Barfleur (Barfleur Lighthouse). In September 1780 the lantern was replaced with 16 oil lamps with a fire glazed glass lantern and Tourtille-Sangrain reflectors. In 1825 an upgrade of the lens was planned, requiring raising the tower an additional , but the building proved not to be wide enough. Thus, the architect Charles- F√©lix Morice de la Rue drew plans for the tallest lighthouse in the world for that time. It was built from the old lighthouse. Building took place from 1829 to 1835 and the light was first lit on April 1, 1835. The smaller tower's lantern was removed, and it was turned into a semaphore. It remains on site. Vegetable oil was used until 1873, when it was replaced by mineral oil. On May 20, 1891 the name of the lighthouse was changed to Phare de Gatteville (Gatteville Lighthouse). On January 17, 1893 the lantern was replaced with an electric lantern. Sautter-Harle mercury bearings were installed in 1903. In 1944 the lighthouse was liberated without major damage and quickly returned to operation. In 1948 it was connected to the electrical network. The lighthouse remained open to the public until 1996, when it was closed for renovation. It reopened July 5, 1997, as a lighthouse museum. Structure and light The tower is cylindrical with a gallery and a lantern. It is in diameter at the base and at the bridge.

Both species are characterized by their large body sizes and short, deep snouts.

It associates with larch and is found throughout Europe and in Japan. Description The cap is hemispherical when young, later convex to flat, whitish grey or darker. It is up to 12 cm in diameter. It is slimy, and blotchy when old. The large, angular pores on the underside of the cap are coloured pallid to yellowish at first, but become darker with maturity. Yound specimens bear a whitish partial veil which soon shreds. The tubes are concolorous, and have a slightly decurrent stem attachment. The stem bears a thin, slimy, dark-coloured ring in the uppermost part of the stem which is sometimes lost in mature specimens. The stem is divided by the ring into a short lighter, yellowish section above, and a duller, greyish section below. The flesh is whitish-grey, very soft and has a mild or non-distinct taste. The spores are clay-coloured and ellipsoid or subfusiform in shape. Their dimensions are 10-12 by 4-5.5 Œºm. It is an edible mushroom of low quality. Habitat Suillus viscidus forms an ectomycorrhizal association with larch (Larix) specifically, and its distribution is thus limited by the range of the host tree. It occurs throughout Europe, and also in Japan. In Europe, it is considered an uncommon to rare fungus and it is to be found in the same habitat as the common larch bolete, Suillus grevillei, and also the rare Suillus tridentinus.

One of the most famous opera singers of the \\"Golden Age\\" of Viennese operetta, he was a leading tenor and dramatic stage actor at the Theater an der Wien from 1859‚Äì1878. He notably appeared in the world premieres of operettas by composers Jacques Offenbach, Johann Strauss II, and Franz von Supp√©. He also appeared in musical comedies and plays in Vienna, and appeared in stage productions of all kinds as a guest artist in theatres in Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Russia. His son Albin Swoboda Jr. also had a successful career as an opera singer. In 1955 a street in the Hietzing district of Vienna was named after him. Early life Born in Neustrelitz, Swoboda was the son of tenor and opera director Joseph Wilhelm Swoboda and dramatic soprano Angelika Per√©chon-Swoboda. His brother Karl Swoboda was also an opera singer. During his early years he moved often with his parents, living in Leipzig (1837‚Äì1838), Halle, Saxony-Anhalt (1838‚Äì1839), and D√ºsseldorf (1840‚Äì1841). In 1841 both of his parents were engaged at the opera house in Frankfurt am Main, and the family lived there for the next seven years. His mother died in 1846 at the age of 30. In 1848 his father was offered a position at the Carltheater in Vienna, and the family accordingly moved to that city. In 1849 his father joined the Vienna Hofoper where he worked as a leading and comprimario tenor for the next 16 years and then served as the theatre's director from 1865‚Äì1875. Career Swoboda began his career in 1852 as a member of the opera chorus at the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, a decision which his father initially opposed. He left there a few years later to join the opera house in Krak√≥w where he samg his first leading roles and appeared in plays. Engagements in operas and plays soon followed in Linz, Bad Ischl, and Salzburg. In 1857 he returned to Vienna when Johann Nestroy hired him as a leading tenor at the Carltheater where he appeared mostly in musical comedies and farces. In 1859 Swoboda left the Carltheater to become a leading tenor and dramatic actor at the Theater an der Wien. He remained committed to that theatre for the next 14 years, and afterwards appeared as a guest artist. He drew acclaim in the operetta repertoire, and notably sang in numerous world premieres at that house; including Karl in Supp√©'s Das Pensionat (1860), Janio in Strauss's Indigo und die vierzig R√§uber, Lambrequin in Offenbach's Der schwarze Korsar (1872), Arthur Bryk in Strauss's Der Karneval in Rom (1873), and Helmut Forst in Strauss's Blindekuh (1878). Other roles in his repertoire included P√¢ris in La belle H√©l√®ne, Piquillo in La P√©richole, and the title role in Orpheus in the Underworld. As a dramatic actor he appeared to critical success in the world premieres of several plays by Ludwig Anzengruber among other stage parts. In 1873 Swoboda was appointed the first artistic director at the newly built Ringtheater which presented its first performance in January 1874. He left there in 1875 to work in the same capacity at the new Deutsches Theater Budapest under his father who was general director. He notably sang the role of Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus for the theatre's inaugural performance. In January 1878 he succeeded his father as general director of theatre, but left that position the following year due to financial reasons. In 1880 he performed in operettas and musical comedies in Russia and Poland, including performances in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, and Lodz among others. In 1881 he was committed to the Semperoper, after which he abandoned his singing career and performed only as a dramatic actor. Other than appearances in popular plays in Vienna in 1883 and 1898, his latter career never matched the success he enjoyed earlier. Swoboda died in 1901 at the age of 64. He was married twice during his life. His first marriage to soprano Friederike Fischer (1844‚Äì1898), whom he starred opposite on several occasions at the Theater an der Wien, ended in divorce. Their son Albin Swoboda Jr. had a successful career as an operatic bass-baritone. His second marriage was to the dramatic actress Gretchen Swoboda (1872‚Äì1921).

Her first name is sometimes spelt \\"Catharine\\". Biography Payton was born at Dudley, Worcestershire, the daughter of Henry Payton (1671‚Äì1746), and his second wife, Ann (c.1673‚Äì1774), daughter of Henry and Elizabeth Fowler of Evesham. She did not attend school until her late teens but studied and read widely, at home, but she decided that poetry, philosophy, and history were distracting her from religion. She spent much time reading to her paralysed father. She was recognised as a Minister at Dudley Meeting around 1748. Her travels in Ireland included those with Mary Peisley in Ireland in 1751. She converted Samuel Neale who was to an important Quaker minister and (later) Peisley's husband. A theme of Payton's approach was her advocacy of an even greater role for women within Quakerism and she wanted the church to change its structures to allow this. At an annual London meeting, she, Mary Peisley and four others proposed that a separate women's group should be formed with the Quakers. This was accepted, but not until 1784. She travelled to America in 1753‚Äì1756 with Mary Peisley. They rode \\"often through thinly inhabited country, braving dangerous creeks, swamps, and wild animals\\", visiting North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New England, and Pennsylvania. During their tour Peisley noted a \\"low state of discipline\\" among Quakers in America, and saw a need for reformation. Her letters and records of this journey \\"were to be seen 70 years later as prophesying the separations that took place within the Religious Society of Friends in 1827 and 1828\\". On 17 March 1757 Peisley married Samuel Neale. Peisley died three days later. Payton had met William Phillips, a copper agentA Copper Agent managed a copper mine in Cornwall. and widower, in 1749 and she married him in 1772, when she moved to his home in Redruth, Cornwall. She died on 16 August 1794 and was buried at the Quaker Burial Ground, Come- to-Good, in the parish of Kea, near Truro. Her stepson, James Phillips, a Quaker printer, published her Memoirs and some other writing after her death.

The film is based on the novel Je ne suis pas une h√©ro√Øne by French author No√´lle Henry. So Little Time is unusual for its time in portraying its German characters in a mainly sympathetic manner, while the Belgian Resistance characters are depicted in an aggressive, almost gangster-type light. So soon after the war, this was not a narrative viewpoint British audiences and critics expected in a British film and there was considerable protest about the film's content.Time Out Film Guide, Penguin Books London, 1989, p.551 Marius Goring considered it as one of his favourite films and was a rare romantic leading role for him, though one of several films in which he played a German officer. The film was made at Elstree Studios with sets designed by Edward Carrick. Location shooting was done over twenty days in Belgium and the Ch√¢teau de Sterrebeek at Zoutleeuw (L√©au) near Brussels was used as the Ch√¢teau de Malvines. Filmed during 1951, it was released in March 1952. Plot In occupied Belgium during World War II, the chateau where Nicole de Malvines (Maria Schell) lives with her mother (Gabrielle Dorziat) is partially requisitioned for use by German forces. Among those billeted there is Colonel G√ºnther von Hohensee (Marius Goring), a ruthlessly efficient Prussian officer. Having lost several male members of her family in the war, the proud and outspoken Nicole holds the Germans in contempt and has no hesitation in making her feelings clear to him. Nicole and von Hohensee discover a mutual love of music, particularly the piano, and G√ºnther starts to coach her. This gradually brings them together and, despite their differences, and the inherent danger of the situation to both, they fall in love. They travel to Brussels to attend the opera, acutely aware of the need to be discreet and the risks involved in being seen socialising with one another. Matters become more complicated when members of the Belgian Resistance, led by her cousin Phillipe de Malvines (John Bailey), target Nicole to steal documentation from von Hohensee to pass over to them, making clear that non-cooperation is not an option. The couple realise that, in one way or another, the relationship is doomed. A sympathetic observer who has noticed their love, his former lover, the opera singer Lotte Sch√∂nberg (Lucie Mannheim), urges G√ºnther to tell Nicole that he loves her and to make the most of it while they can, because there is \\"so little time\\". G√ºnther readily admits that he loves Nicole and believes that she loves him too but refuses to tell her as he feels that there is too much to prevent any future for them. He tells Lotte that he has applied for a transfer back to frontline duties. Matters come to a head after G√ºnther tries to push Nicole away by humiliating one of her friends, Gerard. They argue furiously and are estranged for a few days but, when Nicole learns he is to leave soon, she confronts him one night and begs him not to go. He can no longer resist her and they declare their love for each other. Inevitably, they are betrayed and have to face being parted forever. G√ºnther discovers that Nicole has stolen documents from his desk and confronts her after she returns from delivering them to her cousin, Phillipe. Nicole is shot by mistake by her cousin while he is trying to kill von Hohensee and dies in G√ºnther's arms. Unable to reconcile himself to the situation,Last scenes and knowing that he will be arrested by the Gestapo, von Hohensee shoots himself. Cast * Marius Goring as Colonel G√ºnther von Hohensee * Maria Schell as Nicole de Malvines * Lucie Mannheim as Lotte Sch√∂nberg * Gabrielle Dorziat as Mme. de Malvines * Barbara Mullen as Anna * John Bailey as Phillipe de Malvines * David Hurst as Blumel * Oscar Quitak as Gerard * Andr√©e Melly as Paulette * Stanley van Beers as Professor Perronet Production The film was going to be directed by Max Ophuls and was set in France. French authorities complained so the action was relocated to Belgium. Music The film used several piano pieces played by classical pianist Shura Cherkassky. These include the Piano Sonata in B minor by Franz Liszt, which is used as the main theme music and the piece that von Hohensee first starts coaching Nicole in, and Piano √âtudes by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. The aria Voi che sapete che cosa √® amor or Sagt holde Frauen die ihr sie kennt from the opera The Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also features prominently in the film, being sung in German, both by von Hohensee as he accompanies himself on piano, and in the performance which von Hohensee takes Nicole to see in Brussells. Marius Goring is seen playing the piano throughout the film - it is actually him playing as he was a skilled amateur pianist. Reception Unfortunately, the subject matter of the film was not to the taste of the British public when it was released in April 1952, and there was some controversy about its subject matter, particularly portraying a German officer so sympathetically. Marius Goring was philosophical about it: ‚ÄúA touching little film,‚Äù said Goring later, ‚Äúmy favourite apart from the Powell films. It was too soon after the war and people thought every German was a horror...its timing was wrong.‚Äù Reviews by critics were generally positive: The Times described it as ‚Äúa modest, a sensitive, a touching little film‚Äù. While describing the plot as ‚Äústuff and nonsense‚Äù it however goes on to say: ‚ÄúBut Miss Schell - and Mr Goring greatly helps with his firm drawing of the colonel - puts a spell upon the stuff and the nonsense, making it dissolve and setting in its place a glowing portrait of a very young and heart-breakingly defenceless girl utterly in love.‚Äù C.A. Lejeune in The Observer commented that it ‚Äú...gives a sentimental treatment where sentiment may seem out of place, but once we have accepted that, there is much left in the film to appreciate. Pictorially, it is almost always a delight; in particular, I liked the recurring shots of the neat white chateau, reflected in its lake so that the whole thing looked like a double doll's-house. Mr Goring plays a difficult part with great integrity and just the right mixture of tenderness and chill. Miss Schell is adorable, with her heart-shaped face and wings of dark hair; her quaint way of sitting, looking down and sideways with the head a little tilted, her trick of speaking softly on the middle of an outgoing breath. I thought her very touching, and altogether sweet.‚Äù The review by Marjory Adam in The Boston Globe said: ‚Äú 'So Little Time' is sentimentally appealing but it has emotional heights as well. Nicole's sacrifice to save her lover whom she has betrayed to her countrymen rises to almost unbearable intensity as the terrified girl runs sobbing to stop his car. As for Goring, he is excellent as the haughty Prussian whose heart is torn between duty and devotion to the Belgian girl. Miss Schell and Goring display sensitivity and skill in delineating the love which is so tender in a rough and wicked world of war and death. Here is a film which was made for lovers.‚Äù Home media So Little Time was released commercially on DVD in November 2015. A dubbed German- language version under the title Wenn das Herz spricht (When the Heart Speaks) was released to the German market in 2005.
