During the 1960s he achieved worldwide fame for acting in many films. However, in 2005, he was sentenced 20 years in prison for sexually abusing his own daughter. Biography Ces√°reo Quezadas made his film debut at the age of seven in a film by Ren√© Cardona called Pulgarcito in the reissue of the famous story of the Brothers Grimm. Due to the success of his interpretation and already known with the nickname of Pulgarcito he starred in so many films by Ren√© Cardona, Miguel M. Delgado and Agust√≠n P. Delgado, generally in the role of a rogue boy, orphaned and needy, with an angelic and sarcastic look impudence. In 1961 the film director Luis Luc√≠a takes him to Spain to star, along with Marisol, The film An angel has arrived, which supposes the cusp of his race. Following the classic pattern of other children artists, in the mid-60's Ces√°reo Quesazas sees his cinematographic career begin to decline as he loses the childish candor that characterized him, even so, in 1966 stars in two other films Duel of gunmen and El False hei, again with Joselito. His later films suppose the total decadence with very secondary roles and even mere cameos, causing Pulgarcito to fall into a spiral of delinquency that takes to him to perpetrate a robbery the 20 January 1971. Almost at the end of the day, with the face Covered by a woolen balaclava and carrying a gun, Quezadas enters unnoticed in the shoe store El Taconazo and to the cry of \\"This is an assault!\\" Surprised the clerk, who at that moment faints. Believing that she is dead, Ces√°reo Quezadas Cubillas is allowed to stop and is taken to the Federal District Attorney's Office, where he is interrogated and confesses his crime. Once rehabilitated and together with his first wife, Beatriz, he set up a printing company. From this first marriage are his four children C√©sar, Marisol, Mariana and Beatriz. Later he maintains an affair with his secretary, Claudia, and his wife files a voluntary divorce suit accusing him of adultery. From his second marriage are his sons Gridley and Guillermo, but their relationship with Claudia becomes stormy and this, designer and photographer, ends up discovering a video of Quecidas sexually abusing his daughter Mariana. On April 30, 2005, a judge in the city of M√©rida, Yucat√°n sentenced him to 20 years in prison and he is still, in El Cereso de Yucat√°n.

Beginning with the arrival of large number of Kitchener's Army troops in 1915, and widespread after the Battle of the Somme of 1916, each battalion of a division would have a particular sign of a distinctive coloured cloth patch, either sewn to the uniform jacket (on the sleeves, or the back of the tunic), or painted on the helmet.Chappell pp. 5-6 These distinguishing marks, known as \\"Battle Patches\\" were distinct from the Division signs, and were for the most part simple shapes and colours. The scheme for these Battle patches could be decided at division or brigade level or be based on regimental colours or insignia, and was in some cases continued down to company or even platoon level. This system did not prevent duplication across the divisions, a red square was worn by at least 14 battalions.Hibberd pps. 9, 17, 23, 39, 43, 44, 50, 51, 55, 57, 58, 61 Examples can be see for 20th, 23rd, 38th (Welsh) and 50th (Northumbrian) divisions, and 146th, 147th and 148th brigades. World War II World War II British battledress arm of service (corps) colours By the start of the Second World War, the British Army prohibited all identifying marks on its Battle Dress uniforms in 1939 save for drab (black or white on khaki) regimental or corps (branch) slip-on titles, and even these were not to be worn in the field. In May 1940 this was reinforced by Army Council Instruction (ACI) 419 prohibiting all formation marks on uniforms.Davis p. 92 In September 1940 formation patches were authorized by ACI 1118 to identify the wearer's independent brigade or brigade group.Davis p. 95 A Brigade \\"Formation Badge\\" was sometimes worn when the formation was not attached to a division, as an Independent Infantry Brigade or brigade group (with attached other arms and services). When part of a division the infantry of a brigade wore one or more arm of service strips ( by ), red for infantry, dark green for Rifle Regiments, indicating brigade seniority, one for the senior brigade, two for the intermediate and three for the junior.Davis p. 95 As an independent brigade or brigade group the infantry would only wear one strip, the other arms would also wear their arm of service strip. Battalion specific or general regimental patches, in addition to the shoulder title, could also be worn below the arm of service stripe, but the cost of these had to be borne from regimental funds, not the War Office.Davis pps. 94, 97 In the British Army, ACI 1118 specified that the design for the formation sign should be approved by the general officer commanding the formation and reported to the War Office.Davis pps. 95, 97 A further order of December 1941 (ACI 2587) specified the material of the uniform patch as printed cotton (ordnance issue), this replaced the embroidered felt (or fulled wool) or metal badges used previously. In other theatres the uniform patch could be made from a variety of materials including printed or woven cotton, woven silk, leather or metal embroidered felt (or fulled wool).Davis pp. 99-100 =Infantry= File:1st Independent Guards Brigade Group.svg1st Independent Guards Brigade GroupCole p. 128 File:24th Infantry Brigade Badge.gif24th Infantry Brigade (Guards) File:29th Infantry Brigade Formation Patch.svg29th Infantry Brigade File:31st Independent Infantry Brigade.svg31st Independent Infantry Brigade File:32nd guards infantry.svg32nd Infantry Brigade (Guards)Cole p. 129 File:33rd guards infantry.svg33rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards) File:36th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg36th Independent Infantry Brigade File:37th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg37th Independent Infantry Brigade File:38th (irish) Infantry Brigade WW2.svg38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade File:56th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg56th Independent Infantry BrigadeCole p. 130 File:Cornwall County Division Insignia vector.svg73rd Independent Infantry Brigade File:115th infantry.svg115th Infantry BrigadeCole p. 131 File:116th RM infantry brigade.svg116th Infantry Brigade Royal MarinesBoulanger p. 248 File:117th RM brigade.svg117th Infantry Brigade Royal MarinesBoulanger p. 249 File:148th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg148th Independent Infantry Brigade File:54 inf div -vector.svg162nd Independent Infantry Brigade File:204th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg204th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) File:206th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg206th Independent Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom) File:LincolnshireCounty Division Insignia.jpg212th Independent Infantry Brigade File:214th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg214th Independent Infantry BrigadeCole p. 132 File:218th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg218th Independent Infantry Brigade File:219th Independent Infantry Brigade.svg219th Independent Infantry Brigade File:223rd Independent Infantry Brigade.svg223rd Independent Infantry Brigade File:231st Infantry Brigade (Malta).svg231st Independent Infantry Brigade File:301st infantry.svg301st Infantry BrigadeCole p. 133 File:304th infantry brigade.svg304th Infantry Brigade File:Jewish Brigade insignia.svgJewish Brigade =Armoured and Tank= File:2nd Armoured brigade.svg2nd Armoured brigadeCole p. 123 File:4th Armoured Brigade.svg4th Armoured Brigade File:6th Guards Armoured Brigade.svg6th Guards Tank Brigade File:7th armoured brigade.svg7th Armoured Brigade File:8th armoured brigade.svg8th Armoured BrigadeCole p. 124 File:9th Armoured.svg9th Armoured Brigade File:20th Armoured Brigade.svg20th Armoured Brigade File:21st tank brigade.svg21st Army Tank BrigadeBoulanger p. 142 File:21st armoured brigade.svg21st Army Tank brigade, second pattern from 1944.Boulanger p. 142 File:22nd Amoured Brigade 1st pattern.svg22nd Armoured Brigade 1st pattern, white backgroundBoulanger p. 143 File:23rd tank brigade.svg23rd Army Tank BrigadeCole p. 126 File:23rd armoured.svg23rd Armoured BrigadeCole p. 125 File:24th tank brigade.svg24th Army Tank BrigadeBoulanger p. 148 File:25th tank brigade.svg25th Army Tank Brigade File:27th armoured brigade.svg27th Armoured Brigade File:31st tank brigade.svg31st Army Tank Brigade File:32nd Army Tank Brigade WW2.svg32nd Army Tank Brigade File:33rd tank brigade.svg33rd Tank BrigadeCole p. 127 File:British 33rd Armoured Brigade -

The technologies may consist of various pipes, liners, access ports, sampling pumps, pressure sensors, and sealing mechanisms that are installed temporarily or permanently in boreholes drilled into unconsolidated sediments or bedrock. MLS systems facilitate 1) ongoing measurement and monitoring of depth-discrete water pressures (hydraulic heads) and 2) repeated collection of depth-discrete groundwater samples for chemical testing. Commercial MLS systems are available with as few as three ports (CMT System) to more than 20 ports (MP Westbay and Solinst Waterloo Systems). An essential design element of all MLS systems is that they must prevent hydraulic connection of the various monitored intervals within the wellbore.Einarson, Murray D. 2006. \\"Multi-Level Ground Water Monitoring.\\" In Practical Handbook of Ground Water Monitoring, edited by D.M. Nielsen, 807-848. CRC Press. While installed primarily in water-saturated sediments and rock, MLS systems can also be installed in the vadose zone for the collection of depth-discrete soil gas samples. Hybrid MLS systems can be constructed with some ports in the vadose zone and some ports in the saturated zone.Dumble, P., M. Fuller, P. Beck, and P. Sojka. 2006. \\"Assessing contaminant migration pathways and vertical gradients in a low-permeability aquifer using multilevel borehole systems.\\" Land Contamination &# 38; Reclamation 14 (3):699-712. History Waterloo Multilevel Systems use modular components to form a sealed casing string of various casing lengths, packers, and ports. Monitoring instruments and tubes attach to the stem of each port individually, organized by a wellhead manifold at surface. Prior to the 1970s, collection of discrete groundwater samples from multiple depths in the subsurface required the installation of well clusters or nested wells . Well clusters consist of a closely spaced group of monitoring wells, each well completed to a different depth in individual boreholes. Well clusters were first used in the 1950s at contaminated sites.Cherry, John A., Beth Parker, Murray D. Einarson, Steven Chapman, and Jessica R Meyer. 2015. Chapter 11 Appendix: Overview of Depth-Discrete Multilevel Groundwater Monitoring Techynologies: Focus on Groundwater Monitroing in Areas of Oil and Gas Well Stimulation in California. In LLNL Recommendations on Model Criteria For Groundwater Sampling, Testing, and Monitoring of Oil and Gas Development in California. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory LLNL-TR-669645. Because there is only one well screen in each borehole, there is little risk of vertical connection between zones. The individual wells in the cluster must be installed near one another (e.g., ‚â§10 ft. apart), so that the head data obtained from them is a result of variations in the vertical head and not horizontal gradients. Also, care must be taken to avoid installing clusters of wells with overlapping screens and sand packs ‚Äì this may allow vertical movement of contamination between the wells in the presence of vertical hydraulic gradients. Installation of wells clusters can be expensive because of increased drilling costs associated with drilling multiple borings, especially in fractured rock. Nested wells are wells constructed of two or more well screens and casing assemblies of different lengths installed in a single borehole. The key drawback of nested wells is that it can be difficult to effectively seal the portions of the borehole between the monitored zones. Nested wells were popular in the 1970s but many seal failures occurred. For this reason, nested wells are discouraged or prohibited in many areas.USEPA. 1992. RCRA Ground-Water Monitoirng: Draft Technical Guidance. US Army Corps of Engineers. 1998. Monitoring Well Design, Installation, and Documentation at Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste Sites. Protection, New Jersey Department of Environmental. 2005. Field Sampling Procedures Manual. Ohio EPA. 2008. Chapter 7 - Monitoring Well Design and Installation. State of Washington. 2008. Washington State Administrative Code (WAC) 173-160-420(3). DTSC. 2014. Well Design and Construction for Monitoring Wells at Contaminated Sites. Sacramento, CA. There are typically three separate monitoring intervals in nested wells, although more monitoring intervals have been constructed in very deep monitoring wells.Hanson, Randall T., M.W. Newhouse, C.M. Wentworth, C.F. Williams, T.E. Noce, and M.J. Bennett. 2002. Santa Clara Valley Water District Multi-Aquifer Monitoring Well Site, Coyote Creek Outdoor Classroom, San Jose, California. USGS. The risk of hydraulically connecting the various monitoring zones is inversely proportional to the thickness of the seals between the monitoring intervals. Thus, shallow nested wells with many monitoring zones are more at risk of hydraulic failure than deep nested wells with fewer monitoring zones. Because of the limitations of well clusters and nested wells and a desire for monitoring more vertical intervals, researchers at the University of Waterloo (Canada) developed a MLS to collect depth- discrete groundwater samples at a landfill site in Ontario, Canada (Pickens et al. 1978). That system, which contained multiple tubes within an outer PVC pipe, was subsequently commercialized as the Solinst Waterloo system. Further improvements to that system included the addition of packers to hydraulically isolate the monitoring intervals. In the early 1980s, researchers used multiple gas-drive pumps installed at different depths in boreholes to collect depth-discrete groundwater samples in a fractured rock aquifer.Barvenik, Matthew J., and Richard M. Cadwgan. 1983. \\"Multilevel Gas-Drive Sampling of Deep Fractured Rock Aquifers in Virginia.\\" Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation Fall:34-40. A commercial version of this gas-drive system, named \\"Barcad\\" after its inventors, is available from BESST, Inc. In the mid 1980s, an MLS consisting of multiple ports separated by blank casings was developed. That system, referred to as the Westbay MP system, utilizes a separate tool lowered into the MLS on a wireline to measure aquifer pressures and collect groundwater samples. The Westbay MP System is commercially available from Nova Metrix. Typical 3 or 7-channel CMT installation using layers of bentonite and sand backfilled from surface In the late 1980s, researchers in Israel developed a well insert consisting of multiple diffusion cells that could be inserted into a conventional monitoring well to develop vertical profiles of target solute concentrations.Ronen, Daniel, Mordeckai Magaritz, and Itzhak Levy. 1987. \\"An in situ multilevel sampler for preventive monitoring and study of hydrochemical profiles in aquifers.\\" Ground Water Monitoring Review 7 (4):69-74. This system is not commercially available. In the early 1990s, a team from Science and Engineering Associates, Inc. (SEA) with Argonne National Laboratories developed an instrumentation and fluid sampler emplacement technique for in- situ characterization and fluid monitoring in the vadose zone.Williams, Cecilia, William Lowry, David Cremer, and Sandra Daivit Dunn. 1995. SEAMIST In-Situ Instrumentation and Vapor Sampling System Applications in the Sandia MIxed Waste Landfill Integrated Demonstration Program: Final Report. Sandia National Laboratories. Referred to as SEAMIST‚Ñ¢, the system was constructed of a flexible liner that was everted into an open borehole. Sand was poured into the everting liner during construction to deploy it to the full depth of the borehole. The sand also acted to keep the liner pressed against the borehole walls. Various sensors and sampling devices could be ported through the liner where they were pressed against the borehole). Mr. Carl Keller acquired the manufacturing rights to the system in 1995 and developed a version that could be deployed below the water table for depth-discrete groundwater monitoring. Referred to as the Water FLUTe (Flexible Liner Underground Technology), the system is commercially available from FLUTe, Inc. In the late 1990s, Murray Einarson, working for Precision Sampling, Inc. in California, developed a continuous multichannel tubing (CMT) system for monitoring up to seven different zones in the subsurface. Development and testing of the CMT system was the focus of Einarson's MSc thesis at the University of Waterloo.Einarson, Murray D., and John A. Cherry. 2002. \\"A new multi-level ground water monitoring system utilizing multi-channel tubing.\\" Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation 22 (4):52-65. The CMT system consists of a continuous length of polyethylene tubing that has seven internal channels or lumens. Custom- designed monitoring zones are created on site by cutting ports into the various channels at specific depths. The CMT MLS is commercially available from Solinst Canada. Advantages Waterloo Multilevel System installation within a permanent 4\\" casing and screen string using typical sand and bentonite/cement placement methods. Multilevel systems offer the following advantages over clusters of monitoring wells and nested monitoring wells: * Only one casing (or tube) is placed in the borehole. This simplifies the process of installing annular seals between the monitored zones and improves the reliability of the seals. * A MLS facilitates the collection of ground-water samples and measurement of hydraulic heads from many more discrete depths than can be obtained using typical well clusters or nests. * A MLS facilitates the collection of subsurface head and chemical data over time, which is something that cannot be accomplished using \\"one-time\\" profiling tools like CPT or the Waterloo Profiler. * A single MLS has a much smaller \\"footprint\\" at the ground surface and therefore creates less surface disturbance than a cluster of individual wells. A single MLS is therefore less noticeable and obtrusive than a cluster of wells. * The cost of one MLS with several monitoring intervals is generally much less than the cost of an equivalent cluster of wells except in shallow, soft geological deposits where direct push techniques can be used to install many wells quickly. In some areas, permits may be required for each well in a cluster. This can significantly increase the cost of a cluster of monitoring wells. All of the components of multilevel systems are manufactured with stringent QA/QC standards and there are detailed established procedures for MLS installation and for testing the MLS after installation. Each MLS is an engineered system reproducible from site to site. In contrast, nested wells have no standards for the components and the installation procedures typically vary depending on the well installer. MLSs have the following disadvantages relative to conventional monitoring wells (adapted from Einarson, 2006): * Fewer options exist for collecting water samples because conventional sampling pumps generally do not fit down the smaller MLS tubes or are otherwise unsuitable; this means that collection of large volumes of groundwater may be time consuming and impractical for some types of MLSs; * Owing to the specialized nature of the MLS components and monitoring tools, some specialized training or technical assistance may be required, at least initially; * Some types of MLSs are more difficult to decommission than conventional or nested wells; and * The flow restrictions in the internal components (i.e., the plumbing) of MLSs makes them generally less suitable or versatile for conducting hydraulic tests to measure permeability and storativity. Installation methods Multilevel Monitoring Systems are typically installed in one of three ways: * _Open hole completion_ : the MLS is inserted down a completely open borehole with no casing, except perhaps a surficial casing through overburden into the top of bedrock. This installation method only works in intact rock or in borings drilled in overburden that stay open when the drill bit and rods are removed. This installation method runs the risk of cave in or blockage occurring during installation that may jeopardize the positioning of the sand packs and seals. The risk of borehole collapse is reduced when the borehole is filled with drilling fluid. However, installations of MLS systems in boreholes filled with drilling fluids require more vigorous well development, and, in some cases, jeopardizes the hydrochemistry. Complete removal of bentonite drilling fluids may not be possible due to the limited ability to vigorously develop engineered MLS systems. * _Temporary casing completion_ : the MLS is inserted down the inside of temporary drill casing or core rods extending to the bottom of the borehole and, the seals are emplaced from the bottom as the casing/core rod string is slowly retracted. Hence, the drill casing/core rods acts as the temporary protective shield during the installation. This type of installation is most common when the drilling is done by sonic methods in overburden or in unstable bedrock. Installations using rotary wireline coring tools and air-rotary casing hammer (ARCH) methods are also of this type. * _Multi-screen casing completion_ : the MLS is installed inside of a multi-screened steel or PVC well. Each well screen segment has a sand or gravel pack between it and the borehole wall, and is thus isolated from monitoring zones above and below by a grout or bentonite seal. The MLS is then constructed inside of the multi- screened well. This adds another step to the well installation process (i.e., first installing a multi-screened well), but has several advantages. First, installing conventional steel or PVC wells is straightforward and routine for most drilling contractors. Consequently, it is not necessary that the drilling contractor have expertise in installing multilevel monitoring systems. Once the multi-screened wells have been installed and developed, the drilling contractor's job is done, and the multilevel systems can often be installed by field technicians, often at a lower cost. Second, the various monitoring zones can be developed using standard well development equipment and procedures before the multilevel monitoring systems are installed in the wells. Finally, installing multilevel systems inside multi-screened wells may simplify the task of decommissioning the wells once they are no longer needed. Most of the multilevel systems can be constructed so that they can be easily removed from the multi-screened wells. Then, the multi-screened wells can be pressure- grouted or drilled out using standard well decommissioning procedures. Commercial MLS Technologies =Solinst CMT System= The Solinst continuous multichannel tubing (CMT) system is a system that uses custom- extruded flexible 1.7-inch OD multichannel MDPE tubing to monitor as many as seven discrete zones within a single borehole in either unconsolidated sedimentary or in bedrock. Prior to insertion, ports are created that allow groundwater to enter each of the six outer pie-shaped channels (nominal diameter=0.5 in) at different depths with a central hexagonal center channel (nominal diameter=0.4 in) at the bottom. The multichannel tubing can be extruded in lengths up to 300 feet and is generally shipped as 200 foot lengths in 4-ft-diameter coils. The desired length of tubing, equal to the total depth of the multilevel well plus stickup, is cut from the coil, and the well is built at the jobsite based on the hydrogeologic data obtained from the exploratory boring or other methods. The tubing is stiff enough to be easily handled, yet light and flexible enough to allow site workers to insert the multilevel well hand-over-hand into the borehole. To date, CMT installations have been almost entirely backfilled installations where the sand packs and bentonite seals are poured or tremied from the ground surface. Einarson and Cherry (2002) provide additional information on the CMT system. More information is also provided by Solinst. =Solinst Waterloo System= The Solinst Waterloo Multilevel groundwater monitoring system is a modular MLS designed to collect groundwater data from multiple depths within a single borehole via a series of monitoring ports positioned at specific intervals along 2-inch ID Schedule 80 PVC casing. The various monitoring ports can be connected to a combination of: sampling pumps, transducers, or polyethylene tubes that extend from the ports to the ground surface inside of the PVC casing. The smooth exterior wall of the PVC casing facilitates construction of annular seals between the monitored zones in the borehole via backfilling with alternating layers of sand and bentonite, or using expandable packers manufactured by Solinst. The sections of PVC casing have water-tight joints to prevent hydraulic cross-communication within the well. Depending on the diameter and number of monitoring equipment, the system can have up to 24 ports. The system is described in more detail by Einarson (2006), with additional information provided by Solinst. =Water FLUTe System= The Water FLUTe system is a MLS that uses a flexible impermeable liner of polyurethane- coated nylon fabric inflated against the borehole wall to isolate many discrete intervals, each of which is accessed by a sampling tube that extends to the ground surface. The system is custom-made at the factory to the customer's specifications and then shipped on a reel to the site for installation. The system can be used to monitor a few zones in boreholes as small as 2-inches, to boreholes up to 20 inches in diameter where numerous depth intervals can be monitored (most installations are in the 4- to 10-inch diameter borehole range) with maximum depth to date of 1,400 feet. Depth-to- water measurements can be made inside the sampling tubing using small-diameter water-level meters. Optional dedicated pressure transducers facilitate continuous, long-term pressure monitoring. Water FLUTe systems are described further by Einarson (2006) and Cherry et al. (2007) and by accessing the FLUTe website. =Westbay MP System= The Westbay MP system is a modular instrumentation system for multilevel groundwater monitoring acquired by Nova Metrix in 2015, the MP system consists of two parts: (1) the casing system and (2) portable probes and tools that provide a compatible data acquisition system. The Westbay casing system is designed to allow the monitoring of multiple discrete levels in a single borehole. The casing comes in two different sizes, the MP38 system (38 mm, 1.5-inch) and MP55 system (55 mm, 2.25-inch). One single string of water-tight Westbay casing sections is installed in the borehole. Each desired monitoring zone has valved couplings and ports to access groundwater outside the casing and instruments inside the casing. Westbay packers or backfilled seals are used to seal the borehole between monitoring zones to prevent the unnatural vertical flow of groundwater in the wellbore and maintain the in situ distribution of fluid pressures and chemistry. The Westbay system can be installed in either open rock boreholes or cased wells with multiple screens. Systems have also been installed in backfilled boreholes. Specialized equipment and probes lowered down the casing to each port are used to monitor and collect samples from Westbay systems. This system can incorporate a large number of monitoring intervals because the system is entirely modular and does not require multiple tubes extending to the ground surface. Westbay MLS systems have been installed to a maximum depth of 7,128 feet. Additional information about the system is presented by Black et al. (1986)Black, W.H., Smith, H.R., Patton, F.D. 1986. Multiple-level ground water monitoring with the MP system. In: Proceedings of the Surface and Borehole Geophysical Methods and Ground Water Instrumentation Conference and Exposition, NWWA, Denver, Colorado. and Einarson (2006). More information is also available on the website. Decommissioning To decommission a MLS system in either open rock holes or in multi-screen casing, the MLS must either be removed to allow the hole to be grouted up, or the MLS must be designed such that, when left in place, it can be fully sealed by grouting (i.e. a \\"grouted-in-place\\" system). For backfilled installations, removal of the MLS can be difficult, so the MLS systems are typically grouted in place. Alternatively, the MLS must be drilled out or over-drilled for removal and then the over-drilled hole grouted up. Installation of MLS systems in multi- screened cased wells simplifies the decommissioning process for all systems, which is one reason why such installations are becoming popular. Having a smooth, low-friction, consistent inside-diameter pipe surrounding the MLS system simplifies removal of the MLS components. The multi-screened well casing can then be decommissioned using standard methods such as pressure grouting or by drilling out the casing. Specific guidance and protocol for decommissioning the various commercial MLS technologies is available from the system manufacturers. Applicability =Overburden and rock= All of the commercially available multilevel systems can be installed in unconsolidated overburden, typically using the backfill method. With the FLUTe system, however, the annular seals are created by the liner that is pressed against the borehole wall via pressure applied by water, air or sand that fills the liner. All of the systems can be installed in bedrock. With the exception of FLUTe, annular seals can be installed via the backfill method. Expandable, inflatable packers are also available for the Solinst Waterloo and Westbay systems. Seals for FLUTe MLS systems are created by the FLUTe liner as discussed above. FLUTe systems have been primarily installed in bedrock coreholes, often as part of investigations that incorporate elements of the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) approach. Parker, Beth L, John A Cherry, and Steven W Chapman. 2012. \\"Discrete fracture network approach for studying contamination in fractured rock.\\" AQUAMundi: Journal of Water Science 60:101-116. =Depth ranges= All of the engineered MLS technologies can be installed at shallow depths, but only the Westbay MLS system can be installed to depths up to several thousand feet. The Solinst CMT system is the most common shallow MLS system. There have been more than 5,000 installations of CMT systems worldwide to depths typically less than 200 feet with some installations to 500 feet using 3 Channel CMT. Solinst Waterloo systems are typically installed to depths up to 1000 feet. Water FLUTe and Westbay systems have been installed to depths greater than 1000 feet, although there have been more deep Westbay systems installed than FLUTe systems. The deepest engineered MLS system is a Westbay system with 11 monitoring ports that was installed to a depth of 7,128 feet in Illinois.Locke, Randall, David Larssen, Walter R. Salden, Christopher Patterson, Jim Kirksey, Iranmanesh Abbas, Bracken Wimmer, and Ivan Krapac. 2013. \\"Preinjection reservoir fluid characterization at a CCS demonstration site: Illinois Basin -- Decatur Project, USA.\\" Energy Procedia 37:6424-6433. =Contaminated site assessment and remediation= All of the MLS systems have strong applications in assessing contaminated sites. The MLS wells can be installed along sampling transects to provide economical, high- resolution insights into the contaminant distribution and flux rates.Einarson, M.D., D.M. Mackay, and P.J. Bennett. 2010. \\"Sampling transects for affordable, high-resolution plume characterization and monitoring.\\" Ground Water 48 (6):799-808. Identification of plume cores is very important for designing effective in situ remediation systems such as permeable reactive barriers (PRBs).Guilbeault, M.A., B.L. Parker, and J.A. Cherry. 2005. \\"Mass and flux distributions from DNAPL zones in sandy aquifers.\\" Ground Water 43 (1):70-86. Transects of MLS systems also provide robust data for performance monitoring of in situ remediation. MLS systems also provide information regarding vertical hydraulic gradients. Strong vertical gradients in a head profile can be used to identify aquitards that constitute strong barriers to vertical contaminant migration.Meyer, Jessica R, Beth L Parker, and John A Cherry. 2014. \\"Characteristics of high resolution hydraulic head profiles and vertical gradients in fractured sedimentary rocks.\\" Journal of Hydrology 517:493-507. =Geotechnical= Depth-dependent hydraulic head data is very important for geotechnical studies. Some of the earliest applications of vertical head profiles were in support of geotechnical studies of rock stability (e.g., Patton 1983). =Water resources= There is a strong need for depth-discrete head and water quality data in water resources studies and planning. Variations in heads with depth can identify effective aquitards that can impede recharge to deep aquifers. Vertical head profiles provide important calibration points for groundwater models. Depth-discrete groundwater quality data is also very useful for optimization of well construction and pumping programs to extract groundwater of acceptable quality. One of the biggest deployments of Westbay MLS systems was to support management of a multi-layer aquifer in Orange County, California.Goodrich, James A., and Walter R. Salden. 1990. \\"Implementation of an in-situ multi-level, continuous ground-water data acquisition system.\\" Proceedings of the Fourth national outdoor conference on Aquifer restoration, ground water monitoring and geophysical methods, Las Vegas, Nevada. Westbay MLS well are also used to optimize groundwater quality and extract for a water district in the Mojave Desert of California.Metzger, Loren F, Matthew K Landon, Sally F House, and Lisa D Olsen. 2015.

Basic concept  The static equilibrium equation can be expressed as: : \\\\mathbf{K}\\\\mathbf{d} = \\\\mathbf{f} where \\\\mathbf{K} is the stiffness matrix, \\\\mathbf{f} the force vector, and \\\\mathbf{d} the displacement vector. The number of the degrees of freedom of the static equilibrium problem is the length of the displacement vector. By partitioning the above system of linear equations with regards to loaded (master) and unloaded (slave) degrees of freedom, the static equilibrium equation may be expressed as: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{K}_{mm} & \\\\mathbf{K}_{ms} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{K}_{sm} & \\\\mathbf{K}_{ss} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{Bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{d}_{m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{d}_{s} \\\\end{Bmatrix} = \\\\begin{Bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{f}_{m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\end{Bmatrix} where \\\\mathbf{0} represents the zero vector. Focusing on the lower partition of the above system of linear equations, the dependent (slave) degrees of freedom are expressed by the following equation. : \\\\mathbf{K}_{sm} \\\\mathbf{d}_{m} + \\\\mathbf{K}_{ss}\\\\mathbf{d}_{s} = \\\\mathbf{0} Solving the above equation in terms of the independent (master) degrees of freedom leads to the following dependency relations : \\\\mathbf{d}_{s} = - \\\\mathbf{K}_{ss}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{K}_{sm}\\\\mathbf{d}_{m} Substituting the dependency relations on the upper partition of the static equilibrium problem condenses away the slave degrees of freedom, leading to the following reduced system of linear equations. : \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{K}_{mm} - \\\\mathbf{K}_{ms}\\\\mathbf{K}_{ss}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{K}_{sm}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{d}_{m} = \\\\mathbf{f} The above system of linear equations is equivalent to the original problem, but expressed in terms of the master degrees of freedom alone. Thus, the Guyan reduction method results in a reduced system by condensing away the slave degrees of freedom.  Linear transformation  The Guyan reduction can also be expressed as a change of basis which produces a low-dimensional representation of the original space, represented by the master degrees of freedom. The linear transformation that maps the reduced space onto the full space is expressed as: : \\\\begin{Bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{d}_m \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{d}_s \\\\end{Bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\- \\\\mathbf{K}_{ss}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{K}_{sm} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{Bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{d}_m \\\\end{Bmatrix} = \\\\begin{Bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{T}_G \\\\end{Bmatrix} \\\\begin{Bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{d}_m \\\\end{Bmatrix} where \\\\mathbf{T}_G represents the Guyan reduction transformation matrix. Thus, the reduced problem is represented as: : \\\\mathbf{K}_G\\\\mathbf{d}_m = \\\\mathbf{f}_m In the above equation, \\\\mathbf{K}_G represents the reduced system of linear equations that's obtained by applying the Guyan reduction transformation on the full system, which is expressed as: : \\\\mathbf{K}_G = \\\\mathbf{T}_G^T \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{T}_G  See also  *Finite element method  References  Category:Finite element method Category:Structural analysis ","title":"Guyan reduction"},{"id":"54028322","text":"Quissanga may refer to: *Quissanga District, Mozambique *Bartolomeu Jacinto Quissanga, an Angolan footballer who plays defender for Lazio *Fernando Jacinto Quissanga, an Angolan footballer who plays for FC Rostov.

SKirillova received her master's degree from the Ural State University in 1954 and her PhD from Moscow State University in 1961. She was the first woman mathematician in Belarus to receive the Doctor of Science degree from the Saint Petersburg State University in 1968. From 1954 to 1962 she was an assistant senior researcher, and from 1962 to 1967 a senior researcher at the Ural State Technical University. From 1968 to 1969 she held the position of senior researcher, from 1970 to 2008 she was the head of the laboratory (later Department) of the theory of control processes of the Institute of Mathematics, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. At the same time since 1996, she was chair of the working group of IFAC on optimal control. Since 1994, Kirillova was the founder and leader of the Belarusian Administration and Management Association. She became Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1967, Professor in 1972. Appointed Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1996. Awarded Honoured Worker of Education of Vietnam (SRV) in 2001, and Honoured Scientist of the Republic of Belarus in 2002. Scientific contributions Kirillova has made extensive technical contributions in optimal control theory and optimization. She was an early proponent of using functional analysis to solve linear optimal problems. She developed important conditions for the controllability and observability of linear control systems with delay. She provided a justification for the universal form of necessary optimality conditions for complex control systems based on variational derivatives. She discovered and justified (together with R. Gabasov) the quasi-maximum principle for discrete-time control systems and pioneered its application. She also developed a new numerical approach to solving linear programming problems, and she created numerical methods for the solution of linear, quadratic, nonlinear programming, and optimal control problems. She developed a constructive theory of extreme problems, which provide effective access to the procedures for constructing computing solutions for a wide range of management and optimization problems; since the early 1980s it has been used in the solution applied control and optimization problems.

In 2016 he was the Campbell County, Kentucky chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, after receiving the personal support of Donald Trump early in 2016. As a member of the Republican Party identified with the Tea Party movement, and later as a supporter of Donald Trump, Nolan has often criticized the Republican leadership in Kentucky.

On May 17, 2016 Nolan was appointed by Governor Matt Bevin as one of the four members of the first Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Commission for a term expiring in May 2019, but was removed from office days later due to controversy over a social media post. While he defended himself in the racism scandal, his lawyer admitted he \\"dressed up\\" in KKK costume \\"every year\\". In August 2016, Nolan filed to run for a seat on the Campbell County School Board. He ran on a platform of \\"eliminating property tax revenue for schools gradually\\" and finding other ways to fund education, such as selling naming rights to schools, and advocated state-supported school vouchers and raising teacher salaries. Nolan won election to the school board in November 2016, defeating incumbent Rich Mason. Nolan was noted as continuing to serve on the school board when being \\"charged with human trafficking\\" on May 2, 2017, but resigned from the position on May 4 after being \\"indicted on nine felony and two misdemeanor counts\\". Criminal charges In 2017, Nolan was charged with 28 felonies including charges of rape, human trafficking, witness tampering, prostitution, unlawful transaction with a minor and sodomy.

People of all social background are buried within the cemetery, and it consists from temporary memorial plaques of the death (which are removed over time) to permanent monuments including chapels belonging to private families. The cemetery also includes Commonwealth War graves. History The cemetery was built between 1862 and 1868 on a hill known as Tal-ƒ¶orr which was already a burial ground since prehistoric times. The cemetery and the chapel were built in a neo-gothic design based on designs by the architect Emanuele Luigi Galizia. It was opened on May 9, 1869. Nonetheless, the first burial took place on January 23, 1872. This cemetery is full of old Mausoleums and statues in marble and bronze. The cemetery was further extended in the 1970s. The cemetery contains 277 identified internments and commemorations of military personnel killed in the country in World War I and World War II. Many graves are marked by Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) gravestones. Chapel The chapel The iconic neo- gothic Chapel of Our Lady is definitely the centre of attraction within the whole complex. The cemetery is built around the chapel, which lies on the highest part of the hill. Its spire is visible from miles away above the surrounding trees.

It is native to central and northern Europe and was first recorded in Britain in 1924. Its larvae feed on the leaves of goat's beard (Aruncus dioicus). Description The adult aruncus sawfly is between long. The antennae, head and thorax are brownish-black and the abdomen yellowish-brown, the underside being paler than the upper side. The wings are membranous with brown veins and the tegulae are pale-coloured. Larvae grow to long; they are a translucent green and have short, pale hairs growing from low warts. The head is greenish-brown to brown. Eggs are capsule-shaped, white and about long. Life cycle Aruncus sawflies are all females, breeding by parthenogenesis. The adults emerge in late spring and eggs are laid on the underside of the leaves of goat's beard (Aruncus dioicus) shortly afterwards. Eggs hatch a week later, releasing gregarious larvae, which consume leaf tissue between the main veins. Metamorphosis occurs after four or five weeks in the soil, each pupa protected by silken cocoons. Adults emerge in late July and August producing a second generation of larvae, and occasionally a third generation. Those larvae descend to the ground late in the year, overwinter as pre-pupae, and pupate in the spring. Damage and control In heavy infestations, leaves may be skeletonized except for their main veins, and the plants may become completely defoliated. The larvae can be picked off by hand, or in heavier infestations, chemical pesticides can be used. Organic products such as pyrethrum will control small larvae but more powerful synthetic insecticides are needed when the larvae are large.

Episodes Reception =Critical response= Reverie has received a score of 62% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10, and 42 on Metacritic, which uses a weighted score, based on 7 reviews. Writing for Forbes, Merrill Barr was impressed at the \\"limitless potential\\" provided by the procedural format of a show he describes as a \\"high concept thriller\\" with \\"enough breadcrumbs laid out to entice the audience\\". IndieWire's Hanh Nguyen compares the show favorably with the darker British virtual reality series Black Mirror: \\"The virtual reality setting is a blank canvas that invites play, and the procedural element of Mara regularly retrieving lost souls gives the series an optimistic and hopeful bent. There's plenty of fun here, but with enough pathos to add weight.\\" Conversely, The Verges Adi Robertson, who also compares the show with Black Mirror, was left cold by what she perceived as the broadly optimistic tone: \\"Audiences have gotten familiar with this kind of cautionary yarn, where technology offers a lonely simulacrum of human contact. But Reveries pilot turns the idea toward optimism and earnest schmaltz‚Äîwith extremely dull results.\\" Shana Oneil, posting on /Film, was impressed by the premise, story, and acting, but also found the lack of hard science as a potential problem: \\"The ideas are certainly there, along with the creepy science tech (the actual Reverie connection module squicked me out), but good science fiction needs truth to anchor it.\\" = Ratings = Reverie was the lowest-rated series of the NBC 2018 summer lineup, averaging just over 2 million viewers per episode.

Work Swenson is best known as the first of the translators of the works of Danish writer Soren Kierkegaard into the English Language. He was born in Kristinehamn, Sweden and moved to Minnesota with his parents in 1882, when he was 6 years old. He was educated in the public schools of Minneapolis and in 1894 entered the University of Minnesota. Upon graduation he was offered a position as assistant professor in the department of philosophy at that same university. By 1917 Swenson had progressed to the rank of full professor. His interest in Kierkegaard began in 1901 when he was looking through the books in the city library and came across a thick book about the size of Kant‚Äôs Critique of Pure Reason and decided to read it. The book was Soren Kierkegaard‚Äôs 1846 book Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments in Danish. Swenson enjoyed it so much that he devoted the rest of his life to making Kierkegaard‚Äôs writings available to the English reading public. Most Kierkegaard scholars read Swenson's translations before Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated Kierkegaard again and started the Hong Kierkegaard Library. Swenson taught a course on Great Thinkers of the Nineteenth Century in 1914 and introduced Soren Kierkegaard to his audience. Later he contributed an article about Kierkegaard in 1916 to The Philosophical ReviewDavid F.

Paradise Garden, located at 200 North Lewis Street, is open to the public. It encompasses two and half acres densely filled with buildings, constructions, sculptures, and thousands of objects. Finster's former studio, a yellow, plank-sided bungalow, is now a visitors' center. From it, a path leads to a multi-layered, multi-sided building, the World Folk Art Chapel. History In 1961 Finster purchased four acres of land in Summerville, Georgia, and a few years later retired from his pastoral duties and devoted his time to working this land. It was always a work-in-progress, originally called Plant Farm Museum, but later known as Paradise Garden. Much of the land was swampy, which Finster drained himself. He laid out his collections of found objects which he had spent years accumulating. He built numerous sculptures, one made from castoff bicycle parts and another from old hubcaps. He built a structure lined inside and out with pieces of mirrors. As an extension of his preaching duties, he erected signs covered with Biblical verses or simple exhortations, such as \\"Yo Jesus.\\" In 1976, at the age of sixty-one, Finster began a new chapter of his life. While repairing a bicycle in his workshop at Paradise Garden, Finster had another vision. A smear of white paint on his finger tip looked to him like a human face and he heard a voice command that he \\"paint sacred art.\\" This he did with boundless energy until his death. These objects, largely based in the Bible, American history, and popular culture, filled Paradise Garden. Mostly painted on rough wood, they combined flat, two-dimensional images with dense writing. Roberta Smith, a critic for the New York Times, described Finster's work as \\"apocalyptic text-image paintings, which he seemed to produce at assembly-line rates. Their lush, extravagantly crowded surfaces form later-day illuminated manuscripts and cover subjects that included heaven and hell, tales from the Bible and American history and popular culture.\\" Finster's interests were seemingly endless. He painted Jesus, Elvis, winged angels, George Washington, self- portraits, Marylyn Monroe wearing an American flag dress, demons, Coca-Cola bottles, Mona Lisa, Mickey Mouse, policemen, cowboys, Old Testament prophets, and other subjects in a torrent. Stylistically, they were all of a piece: singular, simple, and bold. Interest grew over the years and in 1991 Howard and his wife, Pauline, moved from Paradise Garden in order to escape the crush of visitors. He continued to work until his death in 2001. In the twenty-five years after hearing a voice in his workshop he had created an astonishing 46,000 sacred objects. After Finster's death Paradise Garden began to decay into the heat and humidity of rural Georgia. His family tried to maintain the site, with little success. The buildings' walls became water logged and decayed and their foundations crumbled. The paintings done on untreated lumber rotted. Kudzu and other vines engulfed what had been created. Finster's home and work began to sink into the rich mud of the Chattooga River valley. Eventually, Chattooga County acquired the site. In 2012 a non-profit group, Paradise Garden Foundation, signed a fifty-year lease with the county and took possession of Finster's property. The cost was one dollar. The foundation's director has characterized it's on-going work as a revival, \\"a way to restore the spirit of the place.\\" Structures have been reinforced. Sunken paintings and objects have been dug out of the ground, cleaned, and put on display. Other objects remain where they were originally placed, degenerating with time. Rotten lumber has been replaced. Buildings have been adapted to different uses. A brook has been dredged and now freely meanders through the site. Garden details In 1982 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Finster had purchased a small church adjacent to his property. It was a simple ranch building which he went on to expand dramatically, Finster's vision of \\"heavenly mansions\\". On top of the original structure, he built a four layer, twelve sided \\"wedding cake\\", ending with a spire shaped like an upside-down funnel. One level is a circular balcony, giving views of the entire site. A large painting inside the church illustrates Finster's cosmos. It's a landscape full of whirling stars and erupting volcanoes. Written across it is \\"Visions of Other Worlds I took the pieces you threw away‚Äîput them together by night & day‚Äîwashed by rain and dried by sun‚Äîa million pieces all in one.\\" Thousands of these pieces are used in a section called Mosaic Garden. Walls and pathways are embedded with shards of colored glass, shells, bits of mirrors, and broken pottery. Gaudi-esque follies of concrete glisten in the sun. The bicycle and hubcap sculptures remain. Finster's rusting objects fill sheds. There are two chapels decorated with his art. Trees are randomly hung with used bottles. Scattered through the site are colored glass domes from telephone poles. A fully illustrated and inscribed Cadillac sedan is parked. Nearby is a welded sculpture done by Finster's friend, Keith Haring. Different areas of the Paradise Garden are connected by a L-shaped gallery on raised stilts. It's corrugated metal roof and planked siding echo the area's traditional agricultural buildings. Large windows bring in light and air. Inside, benches line both sides of the narrow, long space. Finster's paintings and writings are hung on the white walls. The Foundation treats the gallery as a work in progress. Newspaper clippings and testimonials are posted. Visitors have added graffiti. Others have left their works of art and objects as gifts. The current Paradise Garden is both a restoration and expansion of Howard Finster's vision. Art Place America and the Educational Foundation of America have been major benefactors. The site is managed by the Paradise Garden Foundation and is staffed by hired professionals and a large body of volunteers. It is open to the public for self-guided tours. A guest cottage is available for over night stays. The Garden also may be rented for events with up to 250 people. An annual Finster Fest brings visitors, performers and artists from around the world.

Early life Bend was born on August 3, 1838 in New York City. He was the second son of seven children born to William Bradford Bend and Catherine Ann (n√©e Thomas) Bend. His siblings were: William Bradford Bend (1837‚Äì1905), who married Isabella Tomes (1840‚Äì1916), Katharine Ann Bend (d. 1901), who married James Kennedy Whitaker, and Elizabeth Pelham Bend (ca. 1845‚Äì1933), who married Henry Asher Robbins (1829‚Äì1914), a founder of the Waltham Watch Company who owned the Asher House in Southampton. His paternal grandparents were Reverend Dr. Joseph G. Bend, rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Baltimore, who married a granddaughter of Mary Boudinot, sister of Elias Boudinot, president of the Continental Congress from 1779 to 1783. His daughter, Susan Boudinot, married William Bradford, the Attorney General in President Washington's second cabinet. His maternal grandparents were Philip Thomas and Frances Mary Ludlow, who married in 1807. Thomas, a close friend of Abraham Schermerhorn, was the son of Philip Thomas and Sarah Margaret Weems, daughter of William Weems, of Calvert County, who married in 1782. Frances was the daughter of James Ludlow and Elizabeth Harrison, herself the daughter of architect Peter Harrison. James, the tenth of twelve children born to William Ludlow, was a 1768 graduate of Columbia College and the grandson of Captain George Duncan and Gabriel Ludlow, who established the Ludlow family in America, coming to New York from England in 1694. Gabriel, a father of thirteen, became one of the most successful merchants in New York. Gabriel's ancestry is traced to Edward I of England, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Philip III, of France. Career In 1866, Bend became a partner in the firm \\"Mowry, Keys & Bend,\\" along with Albert L. Mowry, Richard W. Keys, and Samuel B. Keys. In 1873, Bend was elected to a four-year term on the Governing Committee of the New York Stock Exchange along with Edward King, John R. Garland, Alfred Colvill, Edward Brandon, G. H. Watson, George W. McLean, Jacob Hays II, Donald Mackay, and John T. Denny. In January 1890, Bend and Leopold Schepp, a fellow broker, had a heated discussion over whether Schepp had offered a lot of the Sugar Trust certificates at 51, which Schepp denied and Bend claimed. After Schepp told him he had misunderstood him, Bend called him a liar and Schepp then told Bend that he talked \\"like a food.\\" Bend then punched Schepp between the eyes. After Bends apology to Schepp, several members of the Stock Exchange continued to seek to bring the issue before the Board of Governors. Ultimately, both men were suspended for ten days by the Governing Board. After further deliberations, the suspensions were increased for both, with Bend being suspended for six months and Schepp being suspended for thirty days. In 1897, Bend celebrated 34 years on the Stock Exchange and the Open Board of Stock Brokers. =Residences= In January 1882, while at his country estate in Riverdale-on-the-Hudson, a fire broke out and destroyed his home. He had lived in the house for almost 10 years at that point, and had accumulated a sizable collection of rare books, paintings, and jewelry, valued at over $40,000. The mansion, which cost over $60,000 to build, which had brick walls and stone trimmings, stood on a bluff overlooking the Hudson River, was surrounded by eight to ten acres of manicured grounds. In 1883, they rented a cottage in Newport, Rhode Island. While there, they attended many of the society happenings. In 1891, they built a cottage at Onteora Park in Hunter which was considered \\"one of the finest residences in the Catskills.\\" The two story home was 77 ft. by 42 ft., built of stone and had nine fireplaces and five chimneys. All the cottages in Onteora were known by a name, the Bend's cottage was \\"Sky High.\\" =Society life= Bend, his wife, and daughters were all prominent members of New York Society during the Gilded Age, attending the most important dinners, balls, dances, cotillions, and donated to many charitable causes. They traveled around the fashionable parts of the Northeast, staying in Newport, Lenox, the Hudson Valley, and the Catskills. In 1892, all four Bends, were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. He was a member of the Union Club, Metropolitan Club, Union League Club, New York City Riding Club, The Players, New York Yacht Club, and the American Geographical Society. Personal life On April 21, 1868, he married Elizabeth Austen Townsend (1846‚Äì1928), the daughter of Isaac C. Townsend and Mary (n√©e Austen) Townsend. Her sisters were Mrs. Buchanan Winthrop, Mrs. Henry Sackett, and Miss Amy Townsend. They lived at West 54th Street and were the parents of two daughters: * Amy Bend (1870‚Äì1957), who married Cortlandt F. Bishop (1870‚Äì1935), in 1899. * Beatrice Bend (1874‚Äì1941), who married Henry Prather Fletcher (1873‚Äì1959), a diplomat who served as the United States Ambassador to Chile, Mexico, Belgium, and Italy, in 1917. Bend died, aged 61, at his residence, 4 East 46th Street in New York, on February 15, 1900. His funeral was held at Grace Church. His wife received his life insurance policy of $40,000. After his death, his widow lived with their younger daughter at 563 Park Avenue. =Descendants= His only grandchild was Beatrice Bishop (1902‚Äì1993), an author and prominent physician who married Adolf A. Berle, Jr. (1895‚Äì1971), a diplomat. After his death, she married Dr. Andr√© Fr√©d√©ric Cournand (1895‚Äì1988), a physician who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. His nephew, Henry \\"Harry\\" Pelham Robbins (1874‚Äì1946), was married to Emily Welles (1888‚Äì1946), sister of Ambassador Sumner Welles (1892‚Äì1961), and a grandniece of the Mrs. Astor, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor (1830‚Äì1908).

Personal life  Davidson was born in Warren, Ohio, on March 1, 1868, to Warren and Mary Elizabeth Doud Packard. Her two brothers, James Ward Packard and William Doud Packard, founded Packard, an automobile manufacturer later taken over by Studebaker. Little is preserved about her personal life, except that she only had three years of public schooling and no university education and that she had one child, Esther, who died in 1902. She was married twice, first to Ephraim B. McCrum Jr. in 1893. In 1910 and 1920, the United States Census lists her husband's name as James B. Davidson. In 1930, her marital status is listed as \\"widowed\\". She died on July 16, 1934, at the age of 66.  Work at the FBI  On October 11, 1922, at age 54, Davidson was hired by director William J. Burns to work at the Bureau of Investigation (the former name of the FBI) as a special investigator; she was the first female special agent. Trained in New York City, she was later assigned to the Washington, D.C. field office. Her starting salary was $7 a day plus $4 when traveling. The Bureau was interested in hiring female agents to work on cases related to the Mann Act, which aimed to combat interstate sex trafficking. However, since she was considered \\"very refined\\", the order was given that she wasn't to be put on \\"rough\\" cases. This, combined with her limited schooling, meant that she was considered to be of limited use when it came to prosecuting such crimes. During her work at the Washington field office, she was also involved in a case against another agent who was selling classified Department of Justice information to criminals. After J. Edgar Hoover became acting director of the Bureau in 1924 following the Teapot Dome scandal, he asked for Davidson's resignation when the Special Agent in Charge at the Washington field office reported that he had \\"no particular work for a woman agent\\". She resigned on June 10, 1924. Only three women became agents in the 1920s and, with the resignation of Davidson and fellow agent Jessie B. Duckstein in 1924 and Lenore Houston in 1928, the FBI had no female agents between 1929 and 1972.  In popular culture  Davidson's mention as the first female FBI agent by the character Lana Kane in the episode titled \\"Waxing Gibbous\\" of the TV series Archer: Dreamland has been noted by The A.V. Club as an example of the show's habit of using obscure references.

Since 2014, the arable land, olive groves and some of the buildings are occupied by a group reclaiming the land to be managed in accordance with the principles of the commons,.  History  First written traces about the villa came from the monks of Vallombrosa Abbey and indicate a probable construction during the 14th century. The first known owners were the Bardi family from Florence who, in 1427, sold the villa to the Portinai family, who, in turn, offered the villa to the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in 1488. The villa was bought by the della Gherardesca family in 1538. In 1610, a private chapel was built but the cult practice was authorised only 45 years later, by Pope Alexander VII. A public chapel was built in 1710. In 1862, the count Ugolino delle Gherardesca ordered works of enlargement and embellishment by the architects Angelo Foggi and Vincenzo Buffi. Internal decoration was made by Olimpio Bandinelli. In 1938, the della Gherardesca family sell the villa, which after two other private owners, was bought by the province of Florence in 1964. The arable land, vineyards and olive groves were, from this time, exploited by a public agricultural company. = Mondeggi Bene Comune = Until the 2000s, the villa and the 200 ha of land surrounding it were managed by a public company, owned by the province of Florence. In 2009, the company was put into liquidation and the land and trees were left abandoned. In 2012, the province announced that both the villa and the land would be sold the following year. At the same time, the Italian debt crisis led the Monti cabinet to authorise the sale of 320,000 ha of public agricultural land. To oppose this measure, the peasant movement Genuino Clandestino launched the Terra Bene Comune campaign. One of the campaign's proposals is to occupy abandoned public land to develop peasant, agro- ecological and self-managed agriculture. In 2013, the Florentine committee of Terra Bene Comune identify the Mondeggi villa as one of the possible places to carry out this project. At the beginning of November 2013, during a meeting of Genuino Clandestino, the campaign \\"Mondeggi Bene Bene Comune Fattoria Senza Padroni\\" was launched, which aims to recover the entire farm and convert it to peasant agriculture. A few days later, the committee \\"Verso Mondeggi Bene Comune - Fattoria senza Padroni\\" was created, composed of inhabitants of the surrounding municipalities. In the same month, the committee carried out its first action. The olives were harvested from the abandoned olive trees on the farm, and the olive oil was distributed free of charge. In January 2014, a Charter of Principles and Intentions was drafted. The occupants declared their intention to undertake a process of conversion from the status of abandoned public property to the status of common. In spring 2014, a collective garden was created. In June 2014, three days of celebration were organised. On this occasion, one of the six houses (a \\"casa colonica\\") located on the farm's territory was open and occupied. In November 2014, the MoTA (Mondeggi Terreni Autogestiti) project began, which aims to allocate olive groves to those who wish to take care of them. Discussions were initiated at the beginning of the year with the local authorities, but in May 2014, the province and the municipality of Bagno a Ripoli, in whose territory the majority of the land is located, confirmed their desire to sell the farm. In October 2014, the auction failed, due to a lack of buyers. In 2017, the villa's furniture and agricultural equipment were put up for sale by the Metropolis of Florence (heir to the province), as a prelude to the sale of the villa and the land in a single lot. Still in 2017, a Civic Declaration of Use was drafted by the occupants, to serve as a basis for dialogue with the administrations (province and municipality). According to the occupants' legal interpretation, this declaration makes them a \\"community\\", a legal personality recognizable by the authorities. This interpretation is inspired by the example of the former Asilo Filangieri of Naples. The entire villa and land was put up for sale in 2019 but, again, did not find a buyer. In 2019, Mondeggi was removed from the list of properties for sale by the metropolis. The metropolis says it is open to the discussion of opportunities other than sales and declare to be waiting for the drafting of a regulation of common goods by its services.  Description  = Villa = = Park = The park is about 200 ha of vineyards, olive groves, woods, grassland and arable land. It includes 6 case coloniche (sharecropper's homes). Two hiking trails have been implemented by the province in 2011.

It was directed by Michael Uppendahl, and written by series executive producer Monica Beletsky. The title refers to the eponymous problem in biology, biophysics and cellular biology. In the episode, Ray Stussy (Ewan McGregor) impersonates his brother Emmit, withdrawing $10,000 from Emmit's bank account, but has to face the consequences, while Emmit (also played by McGregor)'s involvement with the mysterious organization represented by V. M. Varga (David Thewlis) runs deeper than ever before. Meanwhile, still investigating the murder of her stepfather, Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon) meets fellow policewoman Winnie Lopez (Olivia Sandoval), who, unbeknown to both, might prove herself a key element of her investigation. \\"The Narrow Escape Problem\\" was first aired on May 10, 2017, and was seen by 1.05 million viewers. It makes use of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf.  Plot  At Nikki's suggestion, Ray impersonates Emmit so he can retrieve a safety deposit box, believing it contains their father's rare stamp. He intimidates Emmit's banker into giving him the box and allowing him to withdraw $10,000, but discovers the box contains the ashes of Emmit's dead dog. Later, as revenge for the theft, Sy gives Ray's bosses photographic evidence of his improper relationship with Nikki. When they confront Ray, he expresses his love for her and is fired. Despondent, Ray forgets a meeting with Nikki and a wealthy backer she hopes will bankroll them on the bridge circuit, ruining their chances. Learning of Ray's theft, and suspecting Varga was involved in Irv's death, Emmit and Sy consider selling their company. Things escalate when Varga shows up unannounced for dinner at Emmit's house. After dinner, Varga proposes to sign Emmit on as a business partner. Although Emmit is reluctant, Varga convinces him that signing will allow him to become much richer and ensure his wealth is protected; Emmit ultimately complies. Gloria investigates the death of Maurice LeFay, but her superior, Chief Moe Dammik, believes that she is overthinking the case. However, Gloria discovers Ray's business card in LeFay's wallet and goes to his office in St. Cloud. In the restroom, she meets Winnie Lopez, a cop who is investigating hit and run damage caused by Sy when he rammed Ray's Corvette. When Gloria meets Ray, she is very surprised to discover he has the same family name as her murdered stepfather. Winnie visits Emmit's office and interviews Sy about the hit and run incident. Sy is extremely anxious as Varga's henchmen are watching them in the next room. Later that night, Winnie visits Gloria, having made the same connections between the shared last name, Ray and Emmit, Sy's hit and run, and the fact that the name of the town Emmit lives in, Eden Prairie, shares a similar name with Eden Valley, where Ennis lived and was killed.  Production  = Casting = The episode features Billy Bob Thornton, who portrayed Lorne Malvo in the first season of the show, as the narrator of Peter and the Wolf. Previously, Martin Freeman, using his own natural English accent, provided the voice-over in an episode of season 2. It also introduces Olivia Sandoval as Winnie Lopez. = Music = The music for the episode was provided by series composer Jeff Russo. It also features the theme of the original film by Carter Burwell, re-arranged by Russo. The song \\"You Don't Know\\" by Galactic is featured during the end credits. The episode incorporates musical themes from Sergei Prokofiev's musical fairytale Peter and the Wolf.  Reception  =Ratings= The episode was first aired in the US on FX on May 10, 2017, and was seen by 1.05 million viewers. = Critical reception = The Narrow Escape Problem holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being \\"'Narrow Escape Problem' savvily sets the table for subsequent episodes with strong performances, compelling characters, and a satisfying, unexpected callback to Fargo's past.\\" Ben Travers of IndieWire gave the episode a B+ rating and was very enthusiastic about McGregor's dual performances, stating \\"the very idea of Ewan McGregor playing Ray Stussy playing Emmit Stussy is too clever to pass up. You‚Äôre taking an actor already playing twins and asking him to pretend to be one twin as the other twin [...] It‚Äôs two performances in one, and three performances in total for McGregor. We love the idea of it, but we love the execution more. McGregor still had to be so deeply aware of both characters that he‚Äôd understand Ray‚Äôs perception of Emmit: how they differ, how they‚Äôre alike, what he‚Äôd say and do when pushed. It all came through in McGregor‚Äôs brash but false confidence. Just like the wig, we could see the difference between what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs fake, but the 'Fargo' citizens couldn‚Äôt.\\" He also praised the use of Peter and the Wolf and Thornton's voiceover, and how the episode seemed to raise the season's stakes, stating \\"now we‚Äôre ready to see the fireworks. That‚Äôs a lot of pressure for Episode 5, but we still feel safe in Noah Hawley‚Äôs hands. Our hair wasn‚Äôt prickling in fear, but anticipation. Next week is going to be good\\". Brian Tallerico of Vulture gave the episode a four out of five rating, highly praising the characters of Chief Moe Dammick and Winnie Lopez. He did however express concern at the lack of marking events so far this season, stating \\"hardly anything has happened since that air conditioner fell on Maurice. It feels like Noah Hawley is purposefully working a more deliberate opening act, but I‚Äôm hoping for a shocking turn of events next week to really start the fire.\\" Despite calling the episode \\"the weakest of season 3 to this point\\", Vinnie Mancuso of the New York Observer gave a positive review, stating that \\"it did serve to bring us closer to some kind of nasty, unpleasant result, the endgame of an enigmatic criminal with an eating disorder, whatever that may be.\\" He highly praised the performances of McGregor, Thewlis, Thornton, and Olivia Sandoval, calling the latter's a \\"scene-stealing debut\\" and \\"a pure delight\\". He also called Sy Feltz \\"the best character on TV right now\\". Noel Murray of Rolling Stone gave a positive review, highly praising the character V. M. Varga. Scott Tobias of The New York Times gave a positive review, praising the use of Peter and the Wolf, Ray's character development and Olivia Sandoval's performance and character. He did, however, criticize the lack of depth of the season, stating \\"Each season of the show has gotten progressively more confident in spinning its byzantine tales of crime and human folly in [Minnesota]. But there‚Äôs a one-dimensionality to this go-round that hasn‚Äôt been worked out, even after last week‚Äôs necessary tour of the red-herring factory. Reducing the characters to their representative character-instruments in Prokofiev doesn‚Äôt exactly help to add depth, though the trade-off is cleverness for its own sake, which isn‚Äôt the worst outcome.\\" Kevin P. Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B- rating. He highly praised the new character of Winnie Lopez, and the performances of Thewlis, Michael Stuhlbarg, and McGregor. He was unconvinced, however, by its use of Peter and the Wolf, but added \\"Two weeks from now, we all may be marveling at the genius of the Peter and the Wolf parallel. That‚Äôs part of the problem with discussing a highly serialized, highly stylized show on a weekly basis\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club praised the episode for its use of Peter and the Wolf, its story development, the performances of McGregor and Thewlis, and Winnie Lopez's scenes. He however stated \\"there‚Äôs not a lot of excitement to watching these events, however well-structured they may be, play out. [...] Neither Ray nor Emmit have much depth as individuals‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt badly written, but they aren‚Äôt so interesting in and of themselves that we care about what happens to them apart from the novelty of their situation. As a result, too much of this plays like the boring stuff you need to get through to get to what actually matters, which isn‚Äôt a great look for a one-season story that‚Äôs nearly halfway over.\\" = Analysis =  Peter and the Wolf  This episode draws on Sergei Prokofiev's musical tale Peter and the Wolf. In the episode, the narrator, Billy Bob Thornton, explains to the audience what characters are represented by which instruments, as the episode links each Peter and the Wolf character to an equivalent Fargo character: Emmit Stussy as the bird (flute), Ray Stussy as the duck (oboe), Nikki Swango as the cat (clarinet), Sy Feltz as the grandfather (bassoon), Yuri Gurka as the gunshots of the hunters (kettledrums), V. M. Varga as the wolf (French horns), and Gloria Burgle as Peter (strings); Russo occasionally wove the associated musical theme for each character into the episode's original score. Vinnie Mancuso of the New York Observer noted how, during the last scene between Emmit and Varga, the score features a French horn, showing that in this situation, Varga is being a wolf and a predator. He also considered Thornton's final line, ‚ÄúBoys like Peter aren‚Äôt afraid of wolves\\", as \\"the most important\\" of them. Ben Travers of IndieWire stated \\"In Prokofiev‚Äôs fairy tale, Peter (Gloria) is locked in the backyard by his Grandfather (Sy), and a wolf (Varga) does come. The cat (Nikki) escapes, but the duck (Ray) is eaten. Peter then uses the bird (Emmit) to distract the wolf and captures it. Now, I find it doubtful this is exactly how Season 3 plays out\\". He also stated ‚Äú'Boys like Peter aren‚Äôt afraid of wolves,' Billy Bob Thornton says in his final voiceover. The missing subtext? 'Maybe they should be.'\\" Brian Tallerico of Vulture commented, \\"Who are the wolves of Fargo this season? 'The Narrow Escape Problem' is scenes of predator and prey sitting across from each other, one person in a position of power and the other trying to wriggle their way out: Ray and Gloria, Ray and his bosses, Sy and Winnie, Gloria and the new chief, Ray and his boss, and Emmit and V.M. In each of the scenes, there‚Äôs a sense of the hunt, a character pressuring another, and even the thrill of a 'narrow escape'. Scott Tobias of The New York Times criticized the choices of Nikki as the cat and Sy as the grandfather, stating: \\"The Grandfather, at least in this episode, would be more aptly represented by Chief Moe Dammick, who warns Peter/Gloria about the dangers of 'overcomplicating' a case that‚Äôs more simply explained as a drug addict killing for his next fix. When Billy Bob Thornton‚Äôs narrator nods to Prokofiev toward the end ‚Äî 'Peter paid no attention to his grandfather‚Äôs words. Boys like Peter aren‚Äôt afraid of wolves.' ‚Äî Gloria is acting in defiance of Dammick, not Sy. And the cat, Peter‚Äôs companion in the story, is a stranger to Gloria and will be hostile to her interests\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club noted that the fact Emmit and his identical, less successful brother Ray were respectively the bird and duck was a good joke.  Other  In the episode, Ray, impersonates his brother Emmit and withdraws $10,000 from his brother's account, the estimated value of their dead father's rare stamp, which Ray believes Emmit owes him. Scott Tobias of The New York Times noted that Ray taking \\"only\\" $10,000 from his brother's account made him sympathetic, adding \\"He believes his brother owes him that stamp, but he‚Äôs not interested in taking more than it‚Äôs worth.\\" Noel Murray of Rolling Stone stated \\"back in the car, when Nikki complains that he didn't take more money, Ray shrugs her off: 'See, that's the criminal mentality.' Even though he just stole 10 grand, he's no crook.\\" Murray called V. M. Varga \\"the perfect villain for our times\\", calling him, \\"an agent of the kleptocrats ‚Äì with ties to Vladimir Putin and an innate understanding of how \\"fake news\\" and shameless bullying works ‚Äì this year's adversary is practically a living embodiment of everything terrifying that's happening in the world circa 2017. He even speaks the language of our more authoritarian leaders, arguing that we live in 'the age of the refugee,' and that the best we can do is lay low and take care of ourselves, before the inevitable revolution comes.\\" In the episode, Yuri Gurka explains the three meanings of \\"truth\\" in the Russian language: ‚Äúpravda,‚Äù (man's truth), ‚Äúistina,‚Äù (God's truth), and ‚Äùnepravda‚Äù, (what the leader decides is true). Mancuso of the New York Observer defined Fargo as \\"the purest combination of all three of those concepts at the same time\\".

His most notable work is American Conspiracy Theories (Oxford, 2014) co-authored with Joseph M. Parent. He is an associate professor at the University of Miami's Political Science department, and author of several academic publications. Career = Teaching = Uscinski is originally from New England. He received his BA in political science from Plymouth State University, his MA from University of New Hampshire, and his Ph.D. from University of Arizona. He has been a member of the University of Miami political science department since 2007. Uscinski offers courses yearly, featuring prominent journalists and activists, with topics including the elections and immigration reform. Notable past guests have included political and prominent media figures Tom Tancredo, Mark Wallace, Joe Garcia, Carlos Cuerbelo, Herman Cain, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Jorge Ramos, Donna Shalala, Bernie Goldberg, and Joy Reid. He is a frequent contributor to The Washington Post Monkey Cage, and has written several academic journal articles and op-eds in publications such as Politico, Vox, and Newsweek. = Research = In 2015, Uscinski organized and convened the first international conference on conspiracy theory research in Miami. The conference featured more than fifty scholars from ten countries.Jesse Walker, Uscinski was frequently consulted by journalists during the 2016 U.S. election for his commentary on the rise of campaign-fueled conspiracy theories. and for his criticism of their use by politicians. Uscinski has said that \\"Conspiracy theories are in many ways a battle between insiders and outsiders over truth\\". A survey conducted with Sofia Gaston of Centre for Social and Political Risk at the Henry Jackson Society found widespread anxiety about Americans' perceived impact of immigration. It found that 55% of Americans believe the government is concealing the true cost of immigration, which Gaston and Uscinski say indicates that conspiratorial thinking on immigration is mainstream. The survey also found that Republicans are most conspiratorial about immigration, but that 33-50% of Democrats share the same views. This survey was then similarly replicated in the United Kingdom, revealing that 58% of British adults believe the government is concealing the cost of immigration, and that 59% believe those who have spoken out about immigration have been treated unfairly.  Publications  = The People's News: Media, Politics, and the Demands of Capitalism = Uscinski's first book, The People's News: Media, Politics, and the Demands of Capitalism, was published by New York University Press in 2014. In it, he argued that profit motives were the largest factor driving American journalism, and he supported this argument with a study focusing on the likelihood that regional newspapers would reprint a story from the back of the national section of the New York Times as a function of whether or not the story focused on dogs. The study found that dog stories were 2.6 times more likely to be reprinted elsewhere than was the case for equivalent dog-free news. = American Conspiracy Theories = His second book, co-authored with Joseph M. Parent, American Conspiracy Theories, was published by Oxford University Press in 2014. In this book, Uscinski and Parent study the waxing and waning of conspiracy theorizing over time in the United States. The main hypothesis of the book was that conspiracy theories are for losers. By that, they argue that those who are out of power tend to use conspiracy theories to consolidate resources, focus attention on an enemy, and aim at redemption. This manifests itself particularly after elections. According to Uscinski, ‚Äúin the U.S., conspiracy theories tend to swing back and forth. When a Democrat is in the White House, the most resonant conspiracy theories accuse Democrats and their allies of conspiring. When a Republican is in the White House, the accusations focus on Republicans and their allies.‚Äù The book has been widely reviewed and discussed. Recent survey evidence taken before and after the 2016 election provides positive evidence for the \\"conspiracy theories are for losers\\" theory. More controversially, Uscinski argues that Republicans and Democrats are equally taken to conspiracy theorizing, and that Americans may not be engaging in conspiracy theorizing more than in previous decades. Surveys also found that the less educated the respondent, the more likely he or she was to be predisposed to conspiratorial thinking, and that the poor tended to be more conspiratorially inclined than the rich. Uscinski has also found that there are individual differences in our more general proneness toward conspiracy theory thinking. \\"Some people see events and circumstances and immediately think that a conspiracy is behind them. Other people don‚Äôt. Our propensity to see conspiracies lurking behind every corner is largely determined by processes that occurred during our formative years. People‚Äôs world views are solidified as they move into adulthood.\\" Uscinski prominently discussed the use of conspiracy theories in the 2016 election. He argued that President Trump was using conspiracy theories to mobilize sectors of the electorate that did not trust mainstream candidates. Since the election, Uscinski has spoken against fake news, but has suggested that fake news may not be a new problem. = Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them = Uscinski's third book, Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them, was published by Oxford University Press in 2018. The book explores the dark corners of conspiracy theories, how people and democracies act on them, and how the phenomena affects politics and society. Personal life Uscinski was born in Connecticut and lived there until 1983 until his family moved to New Hampshire. Since he was a Yankees fan and found himself in Red Sox territory, Uscinski said he was tormented by classmates. \\"Keep in mind, the Red Sox back then were the biggest losers on the planet, and their fans were terribly angry. Once they started winning in 2004, they went into therapy to deal with the fact that they were no longer losers. Because of this, it‚Äôs much easier to visit home now....\\" References Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:American political scientists Category:University of Miami faculty Category:Plymouth State University alumni Category:University of New Hampshire alumni Category:University of Arizona alumni ","title":"Joseph Uscinski"},{"id":"54028756","text":"Lindsay Maracotta is an American author of eleven novels, including the mass market bestsellers Everything We Wanted, published by Random House, and The Dead Hollywood Moms Society, published by William Morrow.

The 29th installment of the Madden NFL series, the game features New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady on the cover, the second straight year a Patriots player has had the distinction, following tight end Rob Gronkowski. It was released worldwide on August 25, 2017, while those who pre-ordered the \\"G.O.A.T. Edition\\" were able to play it three days earlier and access their copy on August 22, 2017. It is the first game of the series since Madden NFL 2005 not to be released on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and also the first game in the main series to be available on only two platforms since Madden NFL '94. Gameplay Madden NFL 18 is the first game in the series to use the Frostbite engine. While the Madden series has typically featured a Superstar career mode, Madden NFL 18 introduces a story mode known as Longshot, the first such mode in the series. Longshot follows Devin Wade, a quarterback from Mathis, Texas, as he tries to reach the NFL, and includes high school and college football games (the first appearance of the latter in an EA Sports game since 2013, when EA ended the NCAA Football series), as well as the NFL Scouting Combine. The player's decisions and performances in the game determine Devin's career path, as dialog trees are used to help him make decisions. Madden NFL 18 also included many subtle game-play changes. One of the major changes was a new element to the overall difficulty of a game, introducing \\"game styles\\". Game styles were an attempt to create a more enjoyable experience to the player, allowing them to choose (excluding Madden Ultimate Team solo challenges) one of three game styles to fit their enjoyment. The first game style was arcade mode, which was made for players who like an easy experience. Arcade mode made the game much easier for the user. The second game style was simulation mode. This game style was an attempt to make the game-play feel like an authentic NFL game. This brought the difficulty up from arcade mode, but wasn't as intense as the third and final game style, competitive. This was created for the hard-core Madden players, making the AI incredibly skilled, and making game-play incredibly difficult. More minor game-play changes included the addition of Target Passing, a new game-play element when attempting a pass. The goal of this new feature was to give the user more control over the game and have more confidence in the pass going where it was intended to go. Other changes/additions included the creation of MUT Squads, and coaching adjustments in-game. Longshot plot Quarterback Devin Wade, along with childhood friend and wide receiver Colton \\"Colt\\" Cruise, visit Indianapolis to participate in the NFL Regional Combine. There, Devin's performance catches the attention of TV producers Ross Fountain and Julia Vasco, who want him to be the star of a series titled Longshot, which would follow the story of a player with low odds of making it into the NFL and turn him into an NFL Draftee, receiving the assistance of coach Jack Ford, the presenter of the program. Devin and Colt leave without an answer to think. On the drive home, Devin reminisces about his successful high school career before his struggles at the University of Texas, which he left after just four games following his father's death in a car accident. To Devin, Colt, and Julia's surprise, Ross arranges for three other quarterbacks to compete with him on the show. Although Jack urges Ross to select another quarterback due to Devin's inability to call plays, Ross forces Jack to choose him for his better marketing potential and guilt trips him by mentioning Devin's deceased parents. Annoyed by what he considers boring television, Ross arranges an exhibition match for Devin in front of NFL scouts, scheduled to take place in two weeks. Devin is worried about the game, but Colt, who has been invited to the NFL Super Regional Combine, decides to join the show and help him. At a press conference the day before the game, Devin's confidence is shattered by questions about where he had disappeared after his Texas career. Devin asks Ross to postpone the game, but he and Julia are fired. Jack attempts to persuade Devin to stay, but he and Colt drive home. In Texas, Colt tells Devin he is tired of helping him only for him to quit whenever the situation proves to be too difficult, sparking an argument. Devin starts working at his friend's construction business, where his coworkers and former Mathis teammates remember their high school days. That night, Devin is still working against his friends' interests as a Mathis High School football ceremony is taking place. Colt arrives and makes amends with Devin. After the ceremony, Julia visits the two and convinces them to rejoin the show. Returning to the Longshot studios, Devin reunites with Jack and apologizes for leaving, while Jack does so for failing to properly train him. At the meeting, the chairman of the TV network that Longshot is on declares Ross' onscreen behavior inappropriate and leaves his fate in the hands of the player. Following said meeting, Jack introduces Devin to his good friend, former Miami Dolphins great Dan Marino, who further coaches Devin. The two visit a military base in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where Devin was stationed after enlisting in the Army following his time at Texas. There, Captain McCarthy explains how he helped Devin rediscover his love for football. For the Legends Game, Devin's team is to progress through five challenges, with the first three based on moving the offense downfield from certain starting yard lines in an allotted time frame. In the fourth, Devin has to complete a scoring drive without throwing a pass to Colt. For the final challenge, rain falls on the stadium as Devin faces a 3rd and 15 situation, an atmosphere resembling his final game at Texas. After scoring, Devin is greeted by the cheers of Longhorn fans, having finally redeemed himself. Devin and Colt's NFL futures vary based on the player's behavior in the Legends Game. There are three possible endings related to the Draft: Devin gets drafted by his favorite team (which the player picked earlier in the game), or Colt gets drafted by Devin's favorite team's rival and Devin is undrafted. In the former, Devin is selected in the seventh round, but Colt is not drafted. Devin tries to encourage him, but Colt tells him to enjoy the feeling. Devin leaves the house and shouts in glee before stopping to remember his childhood. In the undrafted ending, Colt is drafted in the sixth round, but apologizes to Devin out of disbelief. As the seventh round concludes, Devin is not drafted and leaves the house, where he vents his frustration and sits on the porch. A flashback to his childhood days with his father takes place, where Cutter tells him while victory does not always occur, if one gives it their best, they have the right to feel like a winner. However, Dan calls Devin to announce two teams have expressed interest in signing him as an undrafted free agent: his favorite team and Colt's team. After telling Colt of his new team, the two celebrate. Standing on his porch, Devin receives a text from Jack, who congratulates and thanks him for allowing him to be his coach. Devin returns to his room and looks at his Texas cap on the desk, telling his father he finally had something to be proud of before placing his NFL team's cap with it.  Development  Like Madden NFL 17, EA did not hold an open vote for who would appear on the cover, but personally selected and announced New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in May 2017. EA Sports marketed the game with a trailer featuring Brady's entrance to Super Bowl LI. Madden NFL 18 was released on August 25, 2017 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was first game in the series not to be released on Xbox 360 since Madden NFL 06 and the first not to be released on PlayStation 3 since Madden NFL 07. The soundtrack for the game, which features 40 songs, includes Stormzy, Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean, Imagine Dragons, Steve Aoki, Waka Flocka Flame, Pharrell Williams, Snoop Dogg, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross, Big Boi, Killer Mike, and ASAP Rocky among others. The original score of Madden NFL 13 composed by Colin O' Malley can also be played in the menus via the EA Trax option. Written by EA Sports creative director Mike Young, Longshot is split into three acts, the first discussing the Regional Combine, while the second and third follow the Longshot TV show and Devin's return, respectively. While Longshot is comparable to story modes in other games like NBA 2K MyCareer and FIFA The Journey, Longshot is different in that the protagonist is not a rising star in their respective sport, but is instead a fringe player. Young described the story as like a \\"playable movie\\", rather than a \\"career mode with cutscenes\\". To develop Longshot, EA Sports used motion capture on the actors. Devin is portrayed by JR Lemon, a former Stanford Cardinal football player and member of the Oakland Raiders, while Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali plays Devin's father Cutter. Colt is played by Scott Porter, a cast member in the TV series Friday Night Lights and ex-high school football player. Ross and Julia are portrayed by Ricky Wayne and Marem Hassler, respectively. Rus Blackwell plays Jack; Bill Cowher, who was originally considered for Jack's role, along with former players like Marino, Chad Johnson, and Larry English are also involved in the story. United States Army soldier and former Texas Longhorns long snapper Nate Boyer appears in the story as Captain McCarthy. Like Boyer, Devin is a Texas Longhorn and soldier, which Boyer pointed out was a coincidence; an ESPN documentary about the long snapper was also named The Long Shot. Unlike other characters, Jim Miller and Pat Kirwan appear in the game as live action analysts for the fictional Real Football show, as do players Kirk Cousins and Josh Norman in Twitter videos. NHL player Theoren Fleury and Phil Deschambault wrote the song \\"Longshot\\" for the story. Colt also writes and performs the song in the game.  Reception  On Metacritic, Madden NFL 18 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics for both the Xbox One and PS4 versions despite also receiving \\"generally unfavorable\\" ratings from users. The new game mode Longshot, however, was met with a mixed reception, with some calling it \\"game changing\\" and praising the story, while others referred to it as an \\"ambitious disappointment\\" and criticized the lack of actual football gameplay in the mode. In its 8.6/10 review, IGN wrote: \\"The shift to Frostbite doesn't refresh Madden NFL 18s gameplay much, but Longshot is a memorable single-player mode.\\" EGMNow gave the game a 7/10, writing: \\"Although the new Longshot mode shines, Madden misses the mark with a few of its gameplay additions this year‚Äîso if you don't immediately take a liking to them and choose to ignore them, the experience will feel a lot like last year's.\\" = Accolades = Polygon ranked it 49th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017. The game won the award for \\"Best Fantasy Team Mode\\" at Game Informers 2017 Sports Game of the Year Awards, and was nominated for \\"Best Music Supervision in a Video Game\\" at the Guild of Music Supervisors Awards, and for \\"Sports Game of the Year\\" at the 21st Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. Longshot was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the Writers Guild of America Awards 2017.

Weaver, acting as the Director of Research at the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the March of Dimes,from 1946 to 1953, supported Salk's work with a sense of urgency for the development of the Polio vaccine. Weaver's urgency for developing a vaccine as quickly as possible was somewhat counter to the development of the Oral polio vaccine by Albert Sabin between 1954 and 1961. However, his support of Salk's vaccine was considered to be paramount to the early end of the polio epidemic  Harry Weaver Neuroscience Scholar Award  After many years of dedication to research of MS treatment and strong support for recruiting young investigators, Dr. Weaver's accomplishments were honored by the NMSS through the awarding of the Harry Weaver Neuroscience Scholar Award. This award is offered to researchers who have completed their MS training and are beginning their work in MS research. The award include salary and research funding for a period of five years and is commonly given through universities.

One of many degree-offering schools at VCU, the School of the Arts comprises 18 bachelor's degree programs and six master's degree programs. Its satellite campus in Doha, Qatar, VCUarts Qatar, offers five bachelor's degrees and one master's degree. It was the first off-site campus to open in Education City by an American university. Founded in 1928 as a single painting class by artist Theresa Pollak, VCUarts became the official art school of the university in 1933. Since the early 20th century, the school has benefited from the funding and support of Virginia's state government and wealthy patrons of the arts, which has subsequently aided in the growth of Richmond's cultural profile. The Institute for Contemporary Art is a project that was initially affiliated with the School of the Arts before ownership was transferred to VCU. VCUarts has been consistently ranked among the top 10 art programs in the country by U.S. News & World Report, with its Sculpture MFA program occupying the top spot across all U.S. programs. As of 2016, VCUarts has the top ranked visual arts and design graduate program among public universities, and tied for second overall. History =Founding (1928‚Äì1935)= VCUarts was born within Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), the historical predecessor to Virginia Commonwealth University, as the \\"School of Art\\" in 1928. Initially, the school relied on private donations and the solitary work of its first teacher Theresa Pollak for funding and admissions. According to Henry Horace \\"H.H.\\" Hibbs, the first director of RPI, the catalyst for the school's establishment as a formal institute of art and design was an inaugural gift of $1,000 from Colonel A.A. Anderson, a New York portrait-painter, designer, and conservationist.Hibbs, Henry Horace. The History of RPI. Whittet & Shepperson, 1973, p. 37. In 1928, a board of private citizens (later to be known as the RPI Foundation) purchased for $7,500 a disused brick and concrete stable on Shafer Street; earlier that same year, Anderson‚Äîwho traveled much of his life‚Äîpurchased 900 acres of land where Richmond International Airport stands today. Hibbs, learning of Anderson's career as a painter and philanthropist, appealed to the Colonel while he was in Richmond by informing him of the board's acquisition of the stable and their intention to convert the loft on the property into the school's first art studio. Immediately interested, Anderson offered his $1,000 gift. Additional contributions by the citizens of Richmond totalling $24,000 allowed the school to open for classes by September.Hibbs, Henry Horace. The History of RPI. Whittet & Shepperson, 1973, p. 37-8. Two years prior, artist Theresa Pollak had returned to her home in Richmond after four years studying in the New York Art Students' League. Hibbs also approached Pollak, proposing her a position as an hourly drawing and painting teacher. According to Hibbs' History of RPI, her lack of salary pay was allegedly a common practice in music schools of the time. Restricted by a small working budget, Hibbs explained to Pollak that in order for her to begin classes, she would have to corral her own students. Before the school's first semester in the fall of 1928, Pollak \\"was on the telephone every day contacting everyone I knew who evinced even the slightest interest in art\\"; within the first year, she was able to enroll eight full-time students and nearly 30 on a part-time basis.Hibbs, Henry Horace. The History of RPI. Whittet & Shepperson, 1973, p. 38. The School of Art generally grew in accordance with leading philosophies in global art culture, but at times the administration was hesitant to transpose certain educational standards. In a letter to Theresa Pollak, dated November 27, 1928, H.H. Hibbs expressed stern opposition to the employment of traditional nude models for RPI's art students. \\"The final decision is that we will not use such models for a number of years, if ever,\\" wrote Hibbs. \\"In the morning class models in bathing suits or track suits may be used at any time, but if used in the evening it will be necessary for the teacher to be present at all times.\\" However, in the 1930s the director's stance softened. After attending a burlesque show in New York, he would suggest to Pollak that models appear in bra and G-string. Although rules on nudity were steadily relaxed over time, art models would not appear fully unclothed at RPI until the 1960s.Bonis, Ray, Jodi Koste, and Curtis Lyons. Virginia Commonwealth University. Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 53. By 1930, the state government was interested in supporting the School of Art as a public institute. The State Board of Education ruled that RPI's art school had become eligible for financial aid from both the Commonwealth of Virginia and the federal government, a decision that helped the school gain a foothold in Richmond. The sudden influx of funding allowed the school to expand its curriculum beyond drawing and painting. In addition to what VCUarts today calls the department of painting and printmaking, over the next 17 years the School of Art would add the departments of commercial art (1930‚Äì36), interior decoration (1934‚Äì36), costume design and fashion (1936), and art education (1947). The Anderson Gallery of Art In 1931, A.A. Anderson donated an additional $10,000 to the School of Art, which was used to found the Anderson Gallery of Art in a former carriage house behind Lewis Ginter's mansion. From the gallery's first exhibition‚Äîa solo show of Anderson's paintings‚Äîto its closure in 2015, the Anderson Gallery hosted the work of many contemporary artists who were visiting Richmond. For five years, the gallery was the only exhibition space in Richmond where modern art could be seen first-hand, until the opening of the VMFA in 1936. That year, RPI decided to convert the Anderson Gallery into a library, which slowed its programming until the gallery's original intentions were obscured. During this time, and for the next 33 years, RPI continued to develop the Anderson Gallery as a multi-use facility, hiring full-time librarian Rosamund McCanless and adding a third- story reading room, a mezzanine, an extended book stack five stories tall, and safety features. However, the library continued to keep a selection of artist's prints, many of which were donated from Hibbs' private collection.Garland, Tracy. \\"Excavating the Anderson: The Early History of a Building and its Gallery.\\" Anderson Gallery: 45 Years of Art on the Edge. School of the Arts, Virginia Commonwealth University, 2016, p. 20 Hibbs himself bemoaned the school's many alterations to the space, noting that the changes were made to appease the Southern Association of Colleges, RPI's accreditor.Garland, Tracy. \\"Excavating the Anderson: The Early History of a Building and its Gallery.\\" Anderson Gallery: 45 Years of Art on the Edge. School of the Arts, Virginia Commonwealth University, 2016, p. 20‚Äì1 Over three decades later, Hibbs took part in reviving the gallery's use as an art space. =Expansion and new leadership (1935‚Äì1966)= From the 1930s to the 1960s, as RPI itself expanded rapidly, the School of Art sought to organize itself into a formal place of learning rather than a small curriculum of courses. Marion M Junkin joined Theresa Pollak in 1934, and together they ran the school for eight years until Junkin moved to Washington and Lee University.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 184 During their joint leadership, students at the School of Art would win about ten scholarships from the New York Art Students' League by 1948.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 307-8 In the years before RPI became VCU, the School of Art became one of the largest schools within the institute. By 1941, two photographs from the art school had been published in Life magazine. During the mid-20th century, the leadership of each department within the school would help to shape its character. Raymond Hodges served as chairman of Theatre, founded in 1942; he directed over 100 stage productionsDabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 308 and guided the department until his retirement in 1969. The Raymond Hodges Theatre at the W.E. Singleton Center for the Performing Arts was named for him in 1985.Bonis, Ray, Jodi Koste, and Curtis Lyons. Virginia Commonwealth University. Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 57. During her tenure, Pollak was invited eminent New York artists to Richmond for critiques and lectures, such as Kimon Nicola√Ødes, Edmund Archer, Edward Rowan, and Harry Sternberg.Pollak, Theresa. An Art School: Some Reminisces. Virginia Commonwealth University, 1969, p. 19 Abstract expressionist Clyfford Still was hired to teach at RPI in 1943. While Still's students and Pollak herself grew to admire the artist and his work, he departed RPI after only two years for unknown reasons. In her writings, Pollak claims that no one in Richmond heard from him again, and that his stay at RPI was omitted from most of his biographical material.Pollak, Theresa. An Art School: Some Reminisces. Virginia Commonwealth University, 1969, p. 45‚Äì48 Though Pollak was not enamored with all modern art (she remarked in 1968 that \\"subjective, expressive painting has become hard, schematic, ugly, or minimal\\"), she worked to ensure that the School of Art was an active steward of contemporary work. This would occasionally result in backlash from the traditionally conservative Southern community in Richmond. In particular, her school and leadership endured considerable censure by the administration of RPI when sculptor Robert Morris and dancer Yvonne Rainer performed nude at a school art festival.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 185 Pollak would step down from head of the school in 1950, though she remained on the faculty in a teaching capacity for 19 years. During this period, the former head would later write, the various departments in the School of Art were disjointed and at odds with one another. Pollak opined that through the 1950s and early '60s, \\"the last vestige of any sense of unity\\" had been lost, and doubted that any incoming leadership would be capable of reining in each department into an harmonious and unified institution.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 307 Herbert J. Burgart assumed the role of dean in 1966, earning praise from Pollak. Writing in 1969, she said, \\"He has the ability to see things in the large and thus to organize, while at the same time he is aware of and sensitive to the individual.\\" Burgart received a master's and doctorate in education from Pennsylvania State University, though he did not possess formal training in the arts. =Transition to VCU (1966‚Äì1968)= By the mid-1960s, many staff and students at Richmond Professional Institute wanted to transition RPI into a full university. The institute had only recently severed ties with William & Mary, which now allowed RPI to offer degrees in the humanities. Coinciding with the implementation of new bachelor's programs in English and history, enrollment spiked at the start of the fall semester in 1965. As the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) already maintained a strong partnership with RPI, in 1966 Governor Mills Godwin recommended the General Assembly form a commission to combine MCV and RPI into a single state university. On July 1, 1968, Virginia Commonwealth University was formed.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 222‚Äì24 In June 1969, founder Theresa Pollak retired. Under VCU, RPI's \\"School of Art\\" became the \\"School of the Arts,\\" and later \\"VCUarts.\\" It became accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design in 1973. =Revival of the Anderson Gallery (1969‚Äì1976)= In 1969, the retired H.H. Hibbs was contacted by head of the department of art history Maurice Bonds about acquiring and resuscitating the Anderson Gallery‚Äîwhich had been a library for over 30 years‚Äîfor VCUarts. By 1970, the building was officially returned to its original role as an art gallery, and continued to show work by practicing artists until 2015. Its spiritual successor, the Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond (ICA) also known as the \\"Markel Center at the VCU Institute for Contemporary Art\\", resumes the gallery's role as a space for contemporary art. The Anderson Gallery's collection of over 3,100 works of art is now housed at VCU's Cabell Library. In 2016, the gallery reopened under the name \\"The Anderson,\\" which now exclusively exhibits BFA and MFA student programming. Notable exhibitors over the course of the Anderson Gallery's history, both under RPI and VCU, include Wassily Kandinsky, Ferdinand L√©ger, Pablo Picasso, Red Grooms, Stephen Vitiello, Larry Miller, Howard Finster, Sue Coe, Steve Poleskie, Walter Dusenbery, Komar and Melamid, Dotty Attie, Miles B. Carpenter, Hunt Slonem, Sonya Rapoport, Yoko Ono,Ono, Yoko. Fly: Anderson Gallery, Virginia Commonwealth University, October 18‚ÄìDecember 23, 1996. 1996. Print. and Judy Rifka. Former exhibitors also include Richmond's own Theresa Pollak, Joseph H. Seipel, David Freed, Davi Det Hompson, Richard Carlyon, Lester van Winkle, Frank Cole, Milo Russell, Teresita Fern√°ndez, Elizabeth King, Reni Gower, Sonya Clark, Babatunde Lawal, and Myron Helfgott.Kistler, Ashley. \\"Roundup: Taking Stock of a Long History and the Anderson Gallery's Final Years.\\" Anderson Gallery: 45 Years of Art on the Edge. School of the Arts, Virginia Commonwealth University, 2016, p. 14 =Dean DePillars leads the modern VCUarts (1977‚Äì1995)= In 1976, Dean Burgart resigned in favor of a new position, and Assistant Dean Murry N. DePillars became acting dean and eventually assumed the formal role of dean of the School of the Arts in 1977. DePillars, who also received his doctorate from Pennsylvania State (albeit not in education), was the first African-American dean to lead the School of the Arts. DePillars served as dean until 1995, and under his leadership the school continued to grow in size and sophistication‚Äîparticularly in regards to the departments of music and dance. DePillars was a practicing painter and illustrator, whose appreciation of jazz since his youth in Chicago brought him into contact with many prominent jazz performers; composer Anthony Braxton's 1969 double album For Alto includes a song written for DePillars, \\"To Artist Murray dePillars.\\" While at VCUarts, DePillars would oversee the birth and rapid maturation of a new jazz program. Founded in 1980 by Doug Richards, Jazz Studies would become an award-winning institution at the school.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 310 Under the new dean's leadership, the performing arts departments expanded into a number of new facilities. In 1976, the RPI Foundation acquired the Grove Avenue Baptist Church and renewed the building as the VCU Music Center, today known as the James W. Black Music Center. The W.E. Singleton Center for Performing Arts opened in 1982; its first concert was by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, in its first U.S. performance in a decade. In 1980, the dance program moved to VCUarts from the VCU department of health and physical education, and began offering bachelor's degrees.Bonis, Ray, Jodi Koste, and Curtis Lyons. Virginia Commonwealth University. Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 107. DePillar's tenure at VCUarts would steward the opening of the VCU Dance Center on North Brunswick Street.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 308‚Äì9 The Lee Art Theatre on West Grace Street, a neighborhood cinema turned burlesque theater, was purchased by VCU and converted into the Grace Street Theatre,Bonis, Ray, Jodi Koste, and Curtis Lyons. Virginia Commonwealth University. Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 63. where students studying film and dance could perform and exhibit their work. By the mid-1980s, the School of the Arts would be the third largest art school in the U.S., with over 2,000 full-time students taught by 150 faculty members. During this period, it was also the publisher of Richmond Arts Magazine and the School of the Arts Journal.Dabney, Virginius. Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History. University Press of Virginia, 1987, p. 309 In 1989, as a gesture of international solidarity with the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre, VCUarts students erected a \\"Goddess of Democracy\\" statue on the university commons lawn as a memorial to their slain Chinese peers. They sought the help of local artists, Richmond's Chinese community members, and the generosity of nearby merchants to complete the project.Bonis, Ray, Jodi Koste, and Curtis Lyons. Virginia Commonwealth University. Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 105. =Global influence (1996‚Äì2012)= In 1996, Richard Toscan succeeded DePillars as dean of VCUarts; over the next 14 years, the school's graduate program would see its ranking rise from 25th in the nation (according to U.S. News & World Report) to fourth. VCUarts Qatar In 1998, VCU opened the Shaqab College of Design Arts‚Äîthe first American university to open a campus in the Gulf state‚Äîin what would become Education City. The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, founded in 1995, was interested in bringing reputable higher education organizations to the capital city of Doha, and VCU School of the Arts was the first to strike a deal with the Foundation. The school offered programs analogous to those at VCUarts in Art Foundation, Communication Arts + Design, Fashion Design + Merchandising, and Interior Design.Shaqab College of Design Arts. Shaqab College of Design Arts, Virginia Commonwealth University, n.d. In 2002, VCU transferred control of the Doha campus to VCU School of the Arts, and the name was changed to Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar (also known as VCUarts Qatar). =The ICA and arts research (2012‚Äì )= Dean Toscan's successor was Joseph H. Seipel. Seipel, who would head VCUarts from 2011‚Äì2016, was already a prominent figure within Richmond's arts community before his ascension to deanship. Upon his retirement, he had spent 42 years with the School of the Arts‚Äî17 of which as the Chair of Sculpture. During Seipel's tenure the ranking of the program rose to first in the nation. In 1978, Seipel would make his first mark on the city as co-founder of 1708 Gallery on 1708 East Main Street (which moved to 319 West Broad Street in 2001) and the Texas-Wisconsin Border Caf√© in 1982. For the five years he spent as dean of the School of the Arts, Seipel made the construction of the Institute for Contemporary Art his priority. Though he departed the school before the completion of the ICA in 2018, the privately funded museum was the largest undertaking ever by the university. In 2017, Shawn Brixey became dean of the school, after previously serving as dean of the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design at York University in Toronto, Ontario. On August 5, 2019, VCU announced that Shawn Brixey would be stepping down from his administrative role as dean of VCU School of the Arts. Admission VCU School of the Arts on average services a student body of 3,000 students, of which 200 are enrolled in graduate programs. The class of 2019 consists of approximately 600 freshman students, out of a pool of nearly 2,500 applicants. The average student in that class possesses a 3.7 GPA and a 1147 score on the SAT. 45 percent of incoming students are afforded merit-based scholarships. Prospective students of fine arts and design are asked to submit a portfolio of work along with their standardized test scores and high school transcripts. Through an online submission page, applicants submit between 12 and 16 works of art that they have created over the past two years. The work is expected to be exemplary of their current skill and potential in any chosen discipline. The school does not accept physical portfolios.

Biography Virtually nothing is known of Andrews' life. After the commercial success of some of the first female \\"classic blues\\" singers such as Mamie Smith, Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith in the early 1920s, the Okeh record company made field trips to the southern states to discover unrecorded musicians. In Atlanta, Georgia, they discovered and recorded Andrews in April 1924. He recorded two tracks, \\"Barrel House Blues\\" and \\"Time Ain't Gonna Make Me Stay\\", which were issued as Okeh Records (OK 8137). They were the first commercially-released recordings of a male country blues singer. The record company's advertisement stated: \\"Right where the blues songs were born is where Ed. Andrews was singing ‚Äòem and playing ‚Äòem when the special OKeh Recording Expedition discovered him. Why, man alive, he was just scattering happiness all around, wherever he appeared.\\" \\"Ed Andrews\\", BlindCarre.com, September 22, 2014. Retrieved 12 May 2017 It is not known whether Andrews originated from Atlanta, or was an itinerant musician passing through the city. He played 12-string guitar, and sang with a pronounced vibrato. His style has been likened to that of Peg Leg Howell, a Georgia musician who first recorded in 1926. On the basis of a lyric line, \\"Ain't got nobody lead me round and round\\", it has been conjectured that Andrews may have been blind. Tony Russell, \\"The first bluesman?\\", Jazz & Blues, June 1972, p.15, reprinted at WeenieCampbell.com, December 9, 2005. Retrieved 12 May 2017 Andrews made no further recordings. He was thought to have been \\"approaching middle age\\" when he recorded, Paul Oliver, Barrelhouse Blues: Location Recording and the Early Traditions of the Blues, Hachette UK, 2009 but other aspects of his life are unknown.

In chapters 2‚Äì10 the enemy comes from the north to Jerusalem, whereas in chapters 11‚Äì20 the enemy appears only in 13:20, but 'the modes of tragedy' become more detailed: 'pestilence and sword, famine and captivity' (15:2; 11:22; 14:15; 21:8), as well as 'unburied bodies' (14:16), that birds that scavenge (15:3). The former King Manasseh (2 Kings 21:10-15) is held responsible here, not the people. =Verse 1= : Then the Lord said to me: Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me, yet My heart would not be with this people. Cast them out of My sight and let them go! MEV *\\"Moses and Samuel\\": both persons were 'well-known for their successful intercession on behalf of Israel' (Moses: , ; ; , ; Samuel: ; ; ), but here the Lord rejects Jeremiah's intercession (Jeremiah 14:19-22).Note [a] on Jeremiah 15:1 in NET Bible *\\"My heart would not be with\\": lit. in Hebrew: \\"my soul was not toward\\".Note on Jeremiah 15:1 on NKJV *\\"Cast\\": is from the same Hebrew verb (shalah) used in (translated as \\"let my people go\\"), so it could be an 'intentional play' on the Exodus text but here with the 'ominous meaning'. =Verse 2= : And it shall be, if they say to you, 'Where should we go?' : then you shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord: :: \\"Such as are for death, to death; :: And such as are for the sword, to the sword; :: And such as are for the famine, to the famine; :: And such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.\\"' NKJV Anticipating the people's question, the Lord prepares a harsh answer (in the sense of \\"I will not help you. I no longer care what happens to you\\") by leaving their predicament to death, sword, starvation and captivity, which usually accompany the 'horrors of warfare'. =Verse 3= :\\"I will appoint over them four forms of destruction\\", says the Lord: ::\\"the sword to slay, ::the dogs to drag, ::the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy. NKJV \\"Four forms of destruction\\" in the New King James Version; \\"four kinds of doom\\" in the New American Standard Bible, NASB literally \\"four families\\".Streane, A. W. (1913), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Jeremiah 15, accessed 23 January 2019 Divine Lament(15:5‚Äì9) YHWH is lamenting because he is reluctant to destroy the city, using 'a poignant rhetorical question' to display 'divine anguish' and to portray Jerusalem's pitiful isolation (verse 5), but as the female Jerusalem rejected YHWH, so YHWH destroyed her, after YHWH alone puts effort into the relationship and is 'weary of relenting' (verse 6), so they cannot yet be reconciled (cf. Jeremiah 2:1‚Äì3:25). However, the poem also invites pity for her (verses 7‚Äì9). Jeremiah's Lament (15:10‚Äì21) Jeremiah's second confession can be compared with YHWH's lament over Jerusalem in some points: # YHWH doomed the mothers to childlessness (15:9), whereas Jeremiah's mother doomed him to a life of suffering by giving him birth (15:10) # Divine weariness (15:6) has become prophetic anguish (15:18). This confession is an act of protest in which Jeremiah embodies the questions of the exiles while he complains about his people (verse 15). His hope is that if he repents (verse 19), he will be delivered from 'the hand of the wicked' (verse 21). =Verse 10= :Woe is me, my mother, :That you have borne me, :A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! :I have neither lent for interest, :Nor have men lent to me for interest. :Every one of them curses me. NKJV The King James Version refers to lending \\"on usury\\".: King James Version Lending money and charging interest to a fellow-Israelite would have been contrary to . Biblical commentator A. W. Streane describes verses 10-21, Jeremiah's dejection and God's reply, as \\"one of the most eloquent and pathetic in the Book\\". =Verse 11= :Tell me, Lord, have I not served you for their good? ::Have I not interceded with you ::in time of misfortune and anguish? (NABRE) NABRE The Septuagint wording (, genoito, despota, \\"Know, Lord ‚Ä¶\\") continues Jeremiah's expression of despair from the previous verse, which the Jerusalem Bible describes as \\"a spiritual crisis of the prophet halfway through his ministry\\".Jerusalem Bible (11966), footnote e at Jeremiah 15:10 Streane suggests that \\"the whole (of verses 10-18) is best taken as Jeremiah‚Äôs utterance\\", although some Hebrew texts and many English translations based on the Hebrew begin this statement with \\"The Lord said ‚Ä¶\\", thus: New King James Version: :The Lord said: ::‚ÄúSurely it will be well with your remnant; ::Surely I will cause the enemy to intercede with you ::In the time of adversity and in the time of affliction\\".: NKJV =Verse 18= :Why is my pain unceasing, ::my wound incurable, ::refusing to be healed? :Truly, you are to me like a deceitful brook, ::like waters that fail.

He is co-founder of Journalists and Research Editors, an organization through which he has promoted transnational collaboration among his colleagues. The Beginnings Gerardo Reyes Copello graduated from Law School at the Santo Tomas de Aquino University in Bogota. His first incursions into journalism began in 1978, as an investigator of Prop√∫blicos, a Bogota foundation that supervised the work of congressmen in matters of bills, assistance and debates. The results of this review were published by the prominent journalist Daniel Samper Pizano in the newspaper El Tiempo, and then compiled in two guides for voters.¬øPor qui√©n votar?, una gu√≠a evaluativa de cada congresista, elaboarda por periodistas de investigaci√≥n para que usted sepa por qui√©n vota‚Äô‚Äô, Daniel Samper, Fernando Uma√±a, Alberto Donadio, Alberto Maldonado, Guillermo Rivas, Liliana Tafur, Editorial Oveja Negra, 1982 By that time, Samper founded the investigative unit of El Tiempo, along with Alberto Donadio, an expert lawyer of information access rights. Both journalists invited Reyes to work on the team that, for over a decade, uncovered numerous official and financial corruption scandals and was emulated by other newspapers in Colombia and Latin America. As part of this team, Reyes published a series that documented bribes paid by the multinational Ericcson to several telecommunications officials in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia.‚ÄúMillonarios sobornos pag√≥ la Ericsson‚Äô‚Äô, El Tiempo, Sept. 1, 1987. The series was recognized with the National Grand Prize of Journalism in 1987.Gran Premio Nacional de Periodismo en categor√≠a de Prensa, C√≠rculo de periodistas de Bogot√°, 9 de febrero de 1987 In 1988 he was hired by the newspaper El Nuevo Herald in Miami, where he worked as sub-editor for the local section and correspondent for Latin America. There he combined his investigative work with chronicles from both Miami and the countries he visited. In the 1990s, he reported on Colombia's tumultuous presidential elections in the midst of the cartel war against the government. He brought new elements to the scandal of drug money infiltration in President Ernesto Samper's campaign. His work with reporter Evelyn Larubia on the death causes of a Colombian singer, during cosmetic surgery in Miami, led to the arrest of the physician who practiced it.Las cr√≥nicas fueron publicadas tanto en El Nuevo Herald como The Miami Herald. ‚ÄúMala suerte mat√≥ a paciente, dice cirujano cosm√©tico‚Äô‚Äô, El Nuevo Herald, 26 de julio de 1992, p. 1¬™.; Cosmetic surgeon blames bad luck for patient‚Äôs death‚Äô‚Äô, The Miami Herald, julio 26, 1992, p. 1¬™ . The series received the Hispanic Journalists Association award in 1993 at the Press category. In September 1994, Reyes and his colleague Jeff Leen of The Miami Herald reported that several DEA agents in Colombia had sold Medellin Cartel drug traffickers their diplomatic rights to import cars into that country.‚ÄúDEA checking if agent helped cartel buy a car‚Äô‚Äô, The Miami Herald, Gerardo Reyes y Jeff Leen, p. 1A During these years, Reyes wrote chronicles that were selected for anthologies of Colombian journalism.Las cr√≥nicas fueron publicadas originalmente en el diario El Nuevo Herald y luego en el libro de Reyes, ‚ÄúMade in Miami, vidas de narcos, santos, seductores y soplones‚Äô‚Äô, Editorial Planeta, Colombiana, 1999.

He also wrote a chronicle about an attractive woman who laundered dollars for the cartels. This last one was taken to the television in the series \\"The Butterfly\\".Reyes fue argumentista de esta serie producida por Fox Telecolombia y transmitida por el Canal RCN en 2012 . Su preestreno se realiz√≥ en Chile un a√±o antes. In 1992, he covered the trial of Panamanian General Manuel Antonio Noriega in Miami for El Nuevo Herald and El Tiempo. He also followed the maneuvers of a General of the National Guard of Venezuela to introduce to the United States a ton of cocaine, with the knowledge of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This theme was taken by the show 60 Minutos of CBS. Reyes collaborated with the segment producer, the legendary journalist Lowell Bergman.La pelicula The Insider se basa en un caso de autocensura que provoc√≥ la salida de Bergman de 60 Minutes In 1997, Reyes discovered a secret account of $6 million linked to Nicaraguan Sandinista General Humberto Ortega, brother of the two-time president of that country Daniel Ortega. He also brought to light a plan to kill Cuban President Fidel Castro financed by the powerful Cuban-American Foundation. That same year, he published a report about a group of bankers that, after break in Ecuador, leaving homeless thousands of savers, lived a king's life in Miami.‚ÄúBanqueros quiebran en Ecuador y viven como Reyes en Miami‚Äô‚Äô, El Nuevo Herald, 9 de noviembre de 1999, p√°gina 4 A In mid-1997 he covered for El Nuevo Herald and The Miami Herald the trial of several operators of a cell for the Cali cartel in South Florida. In 1998 he participated in The Miami Herald's team which received the Pulitzer Prize for the best investigation.Dirty Votes‚Äô‚Äô, serie publicada entre diciembre de 1997 y mayo de 1998, en el que se denunci√≥ la compra de votos, votantes fallecidos o que no ten√≠an derecho a votar por ser convictos.

The Reyes' article of the series found that among the voters there were several people convicted for federal crimes, which should have prevented them from voting.The 6th Annual Reva & David Logan Investigative Reporting Symposium: Friday, April 13 ‚Äì Sunday, April 15, 2012 at U.C. Berkeley Investigative Correspondent In 2000, having published a manual on investigative journalism,‚ÄúPeriodismo de Investigaci√≥n‚Äô‚Äô, Gerardo Reyes, Editorial Trillas, M√©xico, 1996 Reyes developed an extensive network of contacts with investigative reporters in Latin America. In one of his trips to Venezuela, with the cooperation of the journalist Luz Mely Reyes, he brought to light the first corruption scandal of the government of President Hugo Ch√°vez: the award of a printing contract of the new Bolivarian constitution to mandatary's collaborators and friends.‚ÄúAliados de Ch√°vez en negocio pol√©mico‚Äô‚Äô, febrero 10 de 2000, El Nuevo Herald He worked with Argentine reporters on the ramifications in the United States of the business of President Carlos Menem and his family; with Peruvians journalists, he revealed the connections of presidential adviser Vladimiro Montesinos. He also worked with Venezuelans reporters in the coverage of a case about a Venezuelan businessman, resident in Miami, that was discovered with a briefcase full of dollars for the campaign of the Argentine president Cristina Kirchner. In 2003, he covered for El Nuevo Herald and the magazine Semana de Colombia, the trial in Miami against the head of the Medellin cartel, Fabio Ochoa. For his journalistic career and his efforts to integrate Latin American investigative colleagues, Reyes received the Columbia University's Maria Moors Cabot Award in 2004. In January 2005, under the title \\"Slaves in Paradise,\\"‚ÄúEsclavos en el Para√≠so‚Äô‚Äô, El Nuevo Herald enero 9 de 2005, p. 1A he started a series that exposed the subhuman conditions of Haitian workers in sugar mills in the Dominican Republic. Based on judicial records and interviews, he published an article in December 2007 that showed the ties of the father of then-Colombian president Alvaro Uribe Velez with a helicopter seized in 1984 in the raid on Tranquilandia, the largest cocaine processing laboratory in the history of the war against drug trafficking in Colombia.‚ÄúCabos sueltos en la muerte de Lara Bonilla‚Äô‚Äô, 9 de diciembre de 2007, p. 1A The report revealed unpublished judicial statements of the sister of the murdered Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, in which he remembered that his brother suspected that Uribe was implicated in drug trafficking. A year before, Reyes had published court documents proving an unknown fact: that Uribe Velez had been accused of the crimes of falsification and contraband in connection with the importation of a Turbocomander aircraft in 1983.‚ÄúAlvaro Uribe y el caso de la nave del olvido‚Äô‚Äô, El Nuevo Herald, mayo 14 de 2006. Pag.25A Together with Gonzalo Guill√©n, a correspondent for El Nuevo Herald in Bogota, Reyes published other reports that shed light on Uribe Velez's relationship with paramilitarism. One of these reports revealed the testimony of former Colombian paramilitary Francisco Enrique Villaba Hern√°ndez, about Uribe and his brother Santiago's involvement in planning a massacre at Aro municipality, Antioquia department, in 1997.‚ÄúDetalles del testimonio que involucre a Uribe con la massacre de El Aro\\", Gonzalo Guill√©n y Gerardo Reyes, El Nuevo Herald, abril 30 de 2008 One year after the article was published, Villalba was killed. From the work of the two journalists wrote Adam Isacson of the Center for International Policy in Washington: \\"El Nuevo Herald has carried out the most daring investigative journalism reporting on the power of traffickers and paramilitaries in Colombia ... much of this is the work of two veteran reporters from El Nuevo Herald, Gerardo Reyes and Gonzalo Guill√©n\\".‚ÄúPlan Colombia and beyond\\", blog de Adam Isaacson, diciembre, 2007 Reyes and Guillen collected key testimonies that compromised Colombian military personnel in the forced disappearances of innocent civilians known as \\"false positives\\";‚ÄúLa verdad escabrosa de los falsos positivos\\", Gonzalo Guill√©n y Gerardo Reyes, El Nuevo Herald, 13 de junio de 2009, p. 1A they also denounced the US government's cover-up of a military man and a US Army contractor involved in the rape of a minor in Colombia,‚ÄúCuestionan investigaci√≥n de EEUU por violaci√≥n de ni√±a en Colombia\\" and the FARC's links with drug trafficking. Reyes revealed in 2009 that then- Defense Minister and later president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos directly intervened to prevent annulation of a contract of his best friend Felipe Jaramillo's company, although army officers recommended another company.Investigan por favoritismo a ex ministro de Defensa, El Nuevo Herald, 25 de mayo de 2009 A year later he found that a son of President Uribe had acted as an intermediary between a Colombian company of the Nule brothers, who were involved in a major bribery scandal, and the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, to participate in one of the mega-works of his father's government in Colombia.‚ÄúHijo de Uribe aflora en investigaci√≥n‚Äô‚Äô, El Nuevo Herald, 15 de diciembre de 2010 Reyes was a correspondent and advisor for Semana magazine until 2007. He also advised magazine Gatopardo and collaborated with the magazine Poder. For more than 10 years, he was a jury of the Prize of the Institute of Press (IPYS) and Society for the Best Investigation in Latin America. He is a member of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). He has been a lecturer and professor at several universities in the United States, Latin America and Spain.  Work at Univision  In 2011 Univision Network, under a new administration by Isaac Lee (CEO News, Entertainment and Digital) and Daniel Coronell (News President) commissioned Reyes to create an investigative unit. The team was initially formed by producer Margarita Rabin and Spanish reporter and producer Tomas Oca√±a. In its first year, Univision Investiga produced the special \\"The Iranian Threat\\",http://www.univision.com/noticias/noticias-de-eeuu/univision- estrena-documental-la-amenaza-irani which shows how a group of Mexican students was recruited by the governments of Iran and Venezuela to prepare a cyber attack on the United States. The students did not accept the mission but decided to tape the diplomats involved, including the Iranian ambassador and the cultural attach√© of Venezuela who was later appointed consul in Miami. Following the revelation of the plan in the Univision special, the US State Department expelled the consul. Chavez ordered the closure of the consulate. In the middle of the year, Univision Investiga released an unknown episode in life of Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio, presidential candidate for the 2016 elections. Reyes found documents showing that in 1987 the US government confiscated the house in Miami of Barbara Rubio, the politician's sister and her husband Orlando Cicilia, as part of a large-scale anti-drug operation against an organization that imported and distributed cocaine and marijuanaUna verdad inconveniente sobre la familia de Marco Rubio in South Florida.

A spokesperson for Rubio called the quest for reaction as something outrageous to sensational journalism. Four years later, The Washington Post, based in part on the documents obtained by Univision, resumed the story and expanded it adding that Cilicia's role in drug trafficking had been more important than it had been initially reported. Details of the controversy that arose between Univision, Rubio, the Republican Party, and the Miami Herald following the report were the focus of an analysis by the media critic of The New Yorker magazine‚ÄúWar of Choice, Marco Rubio and the GOP play a dangerous game on immigration‚Äô‚Äô, Ken Auleta, The New Yorker, enero 9, 2012. http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/09/war-of-choice and the Columbia Journalism Review.Darts and Laurels Univision, The Miami Herald, and Marco Rubio, the GOP's rising star‚Äô‚Äô, Columbia Journalism Review https://www.cjr.org/darts_and_laurels/darts_and_laurels_jenfeb2012.php Univision Investiga aired in 2012 \\"Fast and Furious.

Throughout a spartan but active life, practicing classical Western black and white fine art photography, he made enduring photographs of buildings, bridges, and street scenes of the vast city, ancient ruins and panoramic vistas of the Southwest, and studio setups with varied floral subjects. He passed away from lymphoma in Los Angeles Veteran's Hospital.\\"Sexton, John (2014)\\" Warm tributes to his life and career by some of his close friends and colleagues appear in a ‚Äòcelebration of life‚Äô memorial recounted in ‚ÄòView Camera‚Äô magazine.View Camera, 2014 Early life and education = Urban planner= Born to suburban Los Angeles parents, McSavaney became aware of the visual arts ‚Äî as did most kids of that era ‚Äî from the comics, newspaper pictures, free merchandizing calendars, and posters of all kinds. He describes his boyish amazement in the late 1940s at the new phenomenon of a small grainy black & white TV program. Vacation trips with his parents introduced him to Western landscapes when he made amateur photographs with a consumer camera. Those trips generated a latent interest in landscape photography.McSavaney 1992 Intro Ray started college at USC but soon transferred to UCLA, from where he graduated in 1963, majoring in Art with an emphasis in Design. Subject to the draft he enlisted in the US Army. Trained by the Army in photogrammetry and drafting, he worked on various military engineering projects. Leaving the Army after two years he returned to civilian life in Los Angeles. Putting his college studies and Army experience to use, he worked for Summa Corporation, a Howard Hughes Company, on various building and land development projects. On an art class with Robert Heinecken at UCLA, McSavaney got a brief introduction to photography but had only slight interest in his teacher's subjects from ‚Äòfound objects‚Äô, but he kept some of Heinecken's teachings in mind, and later was able to apply it in his own work. Enjoying the outdoors, Ray was much more attracted to natural landscapes. Sometime in the mid-60s those became his first serious art photography interest.McSavaney 1992 II = Evolving photographic career = Seeking temporary escapes from what had become a stultifying office career, McSavaney took Sierra Club wilderness hikes on which he usually carried his small camera. At times he shared his pictures in various amateur photography shows, learning from feedback comments and critiques. He continually expanded his basic skills through college classes, photography workshops with the experts, assiduous reading, and intensive self-study.McSavaney, Ray Web Sometime in the early 70s, still employed by Hughes but increasingly interested in photography, McSavaney enrolled in an Ansel Adams photography workshop, soon delving into the art and practice of classical black and white Western landscape photography. By this time Adams, a long-established master, was the 'go to' guru for photographic truths and McSavaney was ready for them. Adams encouraged his workshop students to put up their best photographs for review and critique. Thinking he had only masterpieces, Ray was soon brought to reality by the quality of Adams‚Äô images and those of the other workshop instructors ‚Äî Roger Minick, Wynn Bullock, Paul Caponigro, and comparable masters. Determined to achieve that same proficiency level, he began working on improving his craft and his artistic ‚Äòseeing‚Äô.\\"Brownstein, Larry\\" In addition to the subject itself, McSavaney cultivated a sensitivity to its immediate surroundings and overall quality of light. He worked at getting a feel for its immediate environment and interrelationships among its elements. Always aware that there were at least two people involved in a photograph ‚Äî the photographer and the viewer ‚Äî he aimed to have the maximum emotional impact on the viewer. He planned and visualized his final print accordingly. Averring that he found the world difficult to understand ‚Äúthrough isolated bits of information‚Äù, that is, a single photograph, he knew that he wanted to work with related subjects, ideally in a series. He discovered that subtle relationships become clear when presented in a ‚Äòcontext‚Äô of several complementary photographs of the same or equivalent subjects.By a subject's 'relationships', he meant shapes, forms, tonal values, quality of light in its surroundings, and even color. Well aware of the work of Minor White, in addition to that of Adams, McSavaney no doubt knew of the effectiveness of presenting interrelated photographs - which White referred to as equivalents or as sequences.\\"Minor White 1969\\" Ray at Hovenweep NP, May,1993, by Christopher Purcell While on a 1972 Sierra Club photography workshop he showed prints to the instructor, Bruce Barnbaum, who was very much impressed by their quality and originality. As ardent outdoorsmen, both soon bonded on subsequent Sierra Club trips. In the late 70s, becoming increasingly disgruntled with working for an impersonal corporation, McSavaney embarked on his own career in fine-art photography. The friendship and collaboration with Barnbaum soon led to formation of the noted fine-art photography program, the Owens Valley Photography Workshops (OVPW). The pair, later joined by John Sexton, previously one of Ansel Adams‚Äô photography assistants, formed the OVPW staff. As program co-directors, the three organized and managed it until 1990 when they dissolved their partnership by mutual agreement. McSavaney soon established his own photography workshop program;McSavaney, Ray Web Barnbaumand Sextonstill have active fine-art workshop programs. Selection of subject At the beginning of his photography career, McSavaney worked only on subjects that strongly attracted him ‚Äî not atypical of many photographers until they find their own unique ‚Äòvision‚Äô.McSavaney 1992 Intro Conditioned by his years in urban planning, he continued his quest for ‚Äòcontext‚Äô and relationships for his photographic subjects. As noted, instead of isolated subjects he saw that their interrelationships produced stronger compositions. His eight-year series on the ‚ÄúWalking Trees‚Äù at Yosemite National Park and the ever-changing graffiti of the Santa Ana Freeway Bridge, continued with some of White's themes.McSavaney 1992 Plates 46-51; 20-24 One theme permeating McSavaney's photography is lifelong concern for the environment, an attitude that he described as ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a journey through the natural and urban landscapes of the uncertain present\\". So, recurring themes of how man shaped the environment, and conversely how the environment shaped man, are found in his photography, his writings, and workshop discussions. Readily apparent in his writings is the ongoing fascination with natural landscapes that he wanted to express through nuances of fine art landscape photography. By his own admission, his favorite destination was Yosemite National Park. However, several years were to pass before he could photograph there to his satisfaction. In formulating a photograph in his mind's eye, a process Ansel Adams termed ‚Äòvisualization‚Äô,\\"Adams, Ansel (1981)\\" - Ch1McSavaney always looked to making a photograph with the strongest emotional appeal. In his view, that meant harmonizing in the final work the subject's normally awkward brightness range and tonal values. And for that, he had to perfect his increasing mastery of photographic composition - defined by Edward Weston as 'the strongest form of seeing'. That took much practice and intensive experimentation, especially since he was attracted to scenes of tonal extremes. In an apparent contradiction, he also was attracted to scenes that he could portray in a limited tonal range. He termed that ‚Äòhigh key‚Äô in which the print tonal values fall on Zones VI ‚Äì VIII in Adams‚Äô terminology.\\"Ansel Adams 1982, p2\\" Parenthetically, Adams' had words of caution, a caveat emptor, in use of the Zone system as the key to making a good photograph. Wisely stating that it was only a means to an end, a viewpoint that McSavaney quickly adopted, he advocated using it with awareness of its limitations and with its utility. Adams illustrates this in an encounter with a quotidian photographer at Point Lobos stating that, after the Zone System is learned in detail, it becomes a way of thinking and of applying technical principles while visualizing a potential photograph.Adams 1985, p326 It has a basic simple mantra, however: Expose for the shadows, develop for the highlights. Yosemite valley winter landscape, 1973 by Ray McSavaney While many take the view that a ‚Äògood‚Äô photograph (technically) has deep blacks and bright whites, ‚Äòit ain‚Äôt necessarily so‚Äô. Adams quotes an observation from his photographic assistant, John Sexton, slightly paraphrased as, 'many students believe that when they have a good black and a good white, then they have a good print. Actually, at that point, they are only ready to begin to print the negative'.Adams, 1983 p127The point, of course, is that such a technically good photograph may not convey the mood or spirit of a scene that fine art photographers seek in their work.  Main photographic projects  Very early in his career, McSavaney determined to master the 'craft of photography' in order to adequately express his vision of what his mental photograph should represent.Adams, Ansel, (1981) - Ch 10Adams, Ansel, (1983) - pg ix Applying and sometimes extending Ansel's teachings in making an \\"expressive print\\", Ray honed and matured his artistic seeing and technical skills in two especially striking Los Angeles locations. One was the abandoned Uniroyal Tire Factory alongside a then busy highway, now a much busier Los Angeles freeway; \\"Holguin, Rick\\" the other a major construction project in the city center, known as Bunker Hill, Los Angeles Redevelopment.\\"View Camera, 1988, August In working on those unusually contrasty scenes, McSavaney soon discovered that his photographic skills were grossly inadequate. He was challenged by the technical pitfalls presented by scenes with extreme luminance ranges. Adams had discussed in detail just such pitfalls in his book on the Camera.\\"Adams, Ansel, (1980)\\" - Ch 5 With all that in mind in preparation for those difficult projects, McSavaney thoroughly experimented with several of Adams‚Äô techniques for developing film exposed under extreme tonal ranges and lighting conditions. =Urban subjects= Two of McSavaney's early photography series were what he termed \\"The Tire Factory\\" and \\"The Bunker Hill Project\\". In each of these subjects he was faced with ranges of brightness, tonalities, and contrasts that he had not previously encountered. The design motif of the Uniroyal Tire Factory would have done credit to a Cecil B. DeMille Hollywood epic. With almost a third of a mile fa√ßade alongside a busy highway, crenellated and turreted like King Sargon's palace, it mirrored the flapper era national infatuation with exotic foreign and architectural motifs. Serving only as a decorative but secure wall shielding the huge tire factory, it projected the strength and endurance that its owners hoped existed in their products. Surviving until 1978, when its nearly half century of tire production ended, it stood abandoned until redevelopment began on the site in 1989. Living in a nearby city at the time, no doubt regularly going by the factory, McSavaney became intrigued and decided to ‚Äòcheck it out‚Äô. He was among the many fine art photographers of the time who viewed remnants from earlier ages, such as the Tire Factory, the Ancient Puebloan ruins, and Los Angeles bridges, as ‚ÄòForgotten Places‚Äô.\\"Woodward, Josef\\" They had an ongoing quest to photograph them before they disappeared forever. Inspecting the vast Bunker Hill construction site, McSavaney was struck by what he knew was its inevitable impending sterility. He had remembered its small Mom & Pop stores from his Los Angeles youth, its busy street scenes, the many varied activities of the old neighborhoods then being demolished. When Bunker Hill construction was completed in the early 1990s, the result was as he had foreseen ‚Äî an area dominated by institutionalized cookie-cutter high-rise office buildings. However, while it was being built, Ray was attracted to the ongoing construction, the emerging new buildings, and the continual changes as the vast job progressed. He soon realized that accidental arrangements and juxtapositions among the construction tools and materials created unplanned but sometimes visually pleasing compositions. Multiple reflections, erratic lighting patterns, and unusual associations between near and far elements related in striking combinations, especially so at night when areas of light and shadow appeared in unexpected contexts. At such times the construction site, empty of workers and people, showed its stark reality.McSavaney 1992 - V Abandoned tire factory by Ray McSavaney, 1980 Construction at Bunker Hill, LA by Ray McSavaney, 1981 Photographic difficulties - encountered and solved Replete with dark corners, vast inaccessible coal-black interior spaces with barely visible detail, shafts of hazy light beaming through roof and wall breaks, the tire factory presented extremely difficult technical obstacles to making a satisfactory photograph. In terms of Adams‚Äô Zone system, its luminance levels ranged ‚Äòfrom DC to light‚Äô, that is, from Adams Zone I to Zone XVI or higher. Such a wide luminance range generally exceeded the film's recording abilities and extended far beyond that of extant print paper.\\"Adams, Ansel, (1981)\\" - Ch 4 Consequently, in order to make an expressive print, McSavaney faced the need to ‚Äòopen‚Äô shadows and ‚Äòcompress‚Äô highs into ranges that the film could handle, and enable him to make an expressive print. After extensive experimentation, by further diluting the most dilute of Adams‚Äô compensating developers, he found that he could produce a satisfactory negative. Applying the photographer's rule of thumb, ‚Äòexpose for the shadows, develop for the highlights‚Äô, he successfully handled those very difficult subjects. As shown by the accompanying photograph, his techniques worked effectively. Over a two-year period, he exposed more than 800 negatives in the factory. Parenthetically, an estimate of his lifetime production exceeds 50,000 negatives. Of those, about 30,000 remain in his archives. Clearly he didn't believe that all his exposures were masterpieces. In that respect, he agreed with an assertion by his colleague John Sexton, that the single most important darkroom tool was his trash can. In order to make effective photographs of the Bunker Hill constructions, McSavaney faced a new set of technical problems from working at night and in harsh lighting. Once again, as with the Tire Factory, he was faced with a range of luminance extremes that exceeded recording capabilities of available film. However, in Bunker Hill those conditions were compounded by the exposure challenges of the site's bright electrical lights and surrounding streetlights. Eschewing use of floodlights or other artificial lighting, he forged ahead knowing he could take care of exposure problems by control of his materials ‚Äî negatives and print paper. Turning again to experimentation, he suitably modified his film compensating development formulae to handle those new conditions. His techniques are well summarized in photography magazine interviews.View Camera, 1996 The accompanying photograph of a Bunker Hill scene speaks for itself.McSavaney 1992 Plate 38 In a subsequent interview, he discussed the emotional and visual conflicts presented by these urban projects. He found that to his sensitivities, the Tire Factory created \\" a conflict between the grandeur and ugliness of the space\\"; whereas, the new Bunker Hill environment \\"is a sea of well-organized architecture and planning that ... becomes repetitious\\". Knowing the region well, he mentally compared that to the city's old established neighborhoods where \\"there does seem to be an order to the chaos\\".View Camera, 1988 =Landscapes= Although fast becoming an interpreter of the urban scene, his native environment, McSavaney maintained his interest in landscape photography. As previously mentioned, one notable landscape stands out among his favorites,Yosemite National Park. Returning there as often as possible, he discovered new viewpoints and relationships requiring insightful and creative artistic interpretations. Eschewing the adage, attributed to Louis Pasteur, that ‚ÄúChance favors the prepared mind‚Äù, McSavaney left little to chance but much to inspiration from familiarity with a scene or location. He recounts walking through Yosemite meadows in misty early mornings looking for the right combination of light, subject, and surroundings for an expressive photograph. Unlike his mentor Adams who, forty years earlier, reportedly made similar explorations of Yosemite Valley accompanied only by his burro, McSavaney walked through it accompanied only by his camera. Without being especially conscious of it, Ray had the habits of the old time photographers (not to mention painters such as Van Gogh, Monet, Georgia O‚ÄôKeefe) who returned time and again to a favorite location: Ansel Adams to Yosemite, Edward Weston to Point Lobos, Wynn Bullock and Morley Baer to the Big Sur coastline, Paul Caponigro to the Reading Woods, Oliver Gagliani to Bodie and other western ghost towns. No doubt McSavaney learned from an episode recounted by Adams. In driving around Yosemite, Adams kept a weather eye open for photographic opportunities. He recounts driving past an eye- catching river scene \\"hundreds of times\\" but not at a time that he could photograph it to his satisfaction. Except one early morning when everything clicked and he made his photograph. Titled 'Early Morning, Merced River, Autumn' it clearly shows the advantages of familiarity with a subject; repetitive visits can pay off in unexpectedly different ways.Adams, 1983, p 53 John Sexton, his fellow OVPW co-director, also states the value of revisiting a potential subject with the resulting insights it produces. As he notes in his elegant book ‚ÄòQuiet Light‚Äô, ‚ÄúTrying to make photographs that can speak takes time. Seldom do I visit a place for the first time and immediately make photographs I find meaningful‚Äù.John Sexton, 1990, p114 Both McSavaney and Sexton, as with the other masters, far from being in a rut-like repetitive visits to a scene, found it effective if not essential in making memorable photographs. More than any other rubric, McSavaney wanted to make \\"meaningful\\" photographs. McSavaney portrays Sexton's dedication to making a fine art photograph while the two of them searched for worthwhile images during their innumerable trips to the America Southwest in his 'Afterword' to Sexton's luminous book of photographs, 'Recollections' John Sexton, 2006. They both shared the same dedication to making a memorable fine art photograph. No doubt, both McSavaney and Sexton had an Adams' pithy observation in mind, \\"It is easy to take a photograph, but it is harder to make a masterpiece in photography than in any other art medium. Adams, 1980 - Ch 20 In his book, ‚ÄúWest of Eden‚Äù, David Robertson assessed that McSavaney's work in Yosemite ‚Äúfalls into two periods\\". In the mid-70s, he reacted to the Valley's ‚Äúmore quiet and somber moods‚Äù.Robertson, David Less than a decade later, after honing his skills on the urban Uniroyal Tire Factory and Bunker Hills Redevelopment series, McSavaney began to show Yosemite in its more dramatic moods, one of which appears in the accompanying example.McSavaney 1992, Plate 5 Well into his professional career, McSavaney increasingly realized that he had to convey his own meaning in a photograph before it could evoke a kindred emotional response in the viewer. Adams describes the challenge from the viewer's standpoint, \\"For the viewer, the meaning of the print is his meaning\\". Drawing on inspiration derived from the woods and forests that he considered among his ‚Äúfavorite photographic subjects‚Äù, Ray set about creating such responses. One writer, assessing his growing artistic confidence, noted that McSavaney had \\"a natural eye for finding uncommon beauty in unexpected places\\".View Camera, 1996 Putting that 'natural eye' to use in critically surveying a scene, he looked for combinations of elements that would best show the subtle relationships he sought and would be emotionally evocative for his viewers. Echoing John Muir's observation that all things in Nature are \\"hitched to everything else in the Universe‚Äù, McSavaney wanted his landscape photographs to show just how ‚Äúeverything is so interconnected‚Äù. Examples from some of his best Yosemite photographs are shown in his Web site.McSavaney, Ray Web A prolific reader, with a library of well over 1000 books in his small and crowded artist's loft when he passed away, he was well versed in Muir's writings ‚Äî doubly so as a lifelong Sierra Club member. =Pueblo southwest= From boyhood tours with his parents, McSavaney knew of the spectacular scenery and native people of the American Southwest. At the outset of his career, he felt attracted to a region roughly centered on the Four Corners; in turn, roughly the hub of a vast upland known as the Colorado Plateau. In addition to its unrivaled landscapes, included in his many subjects were the 3000-year old Great Gallery pictographs, ‚Äî appropriately shown in the opening and closing scenes of the cult movie Koyaanisqatsi ‚Äî the monumental Mesa Verde National Park and Cedar Mesa Anasazi ruins, now included in the Bears Ears National Monument; the formation of which became an unfolding saga over many years and one that Ray followed with intense interest. McSavaney also was attracted to the rich Hispanic colonial heritage of churches and shrines, especially the iconic Mission Church of Ranchos de Taos and the contemporary Southwest Hopi, Pueblo, and Navajo people. He was especially enamored by Taos Pueblo. Oven, ladder at Taos Pueblo by Ray McSavaney, 1980 In his many sojourns to that historic sun burnt land, some solo, others with a companion or two, he kept an eye open for arresting landscapes, especially the dramatic rock formations of Monument Valley and the mesas of Northern New Mexico such as Enchanted Mesa near Acoma. Almost every year, beginning in the early 80's, McSavaney had a Southwest photography workshop, at first with the OVPW, later with his own program. At every opportunity he made private trips to specific Southwest locations to photograph remote sites ‚Äî the rugged Cedar Mesa canyons held special fascination for him. Considering it a long-term project, he made luminous black and white photographs over several years that portray the unique native history of the region. Sadly, most of them are as yet unpublished ‚Äî he died too soon ‚Äî but are held among his archives at the Huntington Library in the form of an unfinished book. Well aware that his photographs of the Southwest could spur efforts in saving its natural and historical treasures, he had long hoped to join with one its most sensitive and insightful writers, Terry Tempest Williams, in a collaborative effort. It was not to be. In his ambitious Southwest work McSavaney envisioned displaying it ‚Äúfrom man‚Äôs beginning ‚Ä¶ to the present‚Äù, as he states in one of his brochures. He produced work of a quality that far superseded that of most Southwest photographers working in the black and white medium. His treatment of the Southwest subject matter, through luminous dramatic black and white photographs, sets his vision apart ‚Äî as may be apparent in the accompanying photograph, in his Huntington archives, and in several of his website examples.McSavaney, Ray web Effective interpretation With skills honed in the Tire Factory and Bunker Hill projects, McSavaney tackled the challenging Southwest pueblo ruins with as much of an eye to dramatizing as to portraying them. By now, he was a proficient mature professional photographer, fully confident that he could capture any scene, regardless of whatever technical difficulties it may present. His knowledge of materials, gained through rigorous testing and experimentation, allowed him to confidently tackle subjects that would \\"defeat a lesser craftsman\\".View Camera, 1996 In addition to their luminance extremes, the ruins held dark regions of very flat contrast. So, how to handle a subject, part of which is in deep shadow, part in bright sunlight, and in between dark patches of no contrast, regions that he somehow had to open? No hay problema! For most of his Southwest photographs, besides having to compress wide luminance ranges, he simultaneously had to drastically expand parts of many images ‚Äî a very difficult technical exposure situation.McSavaney 1992 -Tech Info Anasazi ruin, Cedar Mesa by Ray McSavaney, 1989 Showing his versatility in control of materials, McSavaney printed many of his Southwest Anasazi ruins in high key. That enabled him to achieve the most effective representation of the ancient ruined dwellings that had reposed for centuries in searing Southwest desert sunlight amid dramatic natural surroundings. Consistent through his work on the Southwest is an ability to capture the extraordinary juxtaposition of the ancient ruins with their dark-stained contorted rock surroundings. Many of his resulting photographs express the undoubted eye for drama and surprise in the enduring heritage of the Ancestral Puebloans. Knowing Adam's admonition that what the artist creates is his message,\\"Ansel Adams, (1985)\\" - p137McSavaney wanted the Anasazi to speak through his photographs as much as he did himself; that is, speak to the viewer. He had a unique ability to see the unified whole - the rock structures and colors, their multitude of forms and textures, the matrix as it were, into which the ancient builders had incorporated their own vision of the world. Having mastered the nuances of negative exposure and resultant printing, McSavaney departed from convention in the Southwest work to convey the eye for dramatic settings ‚Äî some would say ‚Äòchaotic‚Äô ‚Äî that their ancient dwellers undoubtedly possessed. In many cases, their sites were almost always located amid surroundings of cliff overhangs with ominous descending streaks of black algal growth fused to the stone, unusual rock patterns, many affording unlimited vistas. Applying his ongoing quest for appropriate ‚Äòcontext‚Äô, McSavaney photographed the contorted geology of their surroundings as much as the ruins themselves, uniting them into organic compositions. Recognizing McSavaney's penchant for seeking order in chaos, a situation exemplified by many Southwest ruins and crowded Los Angeles street scenes, writer David Robertson again quotes him as stating ‚ÄúRelationships between the objects, or people for that matter, in a photograph are maybe more important than the objects themselves‚Äù.\\"Robertson, David\\" A statement with which the ancient Anasazi, with their keen eye for spectacular dwelling locations, most likely would agree, as would viewers of McSavaney's Broadway and Melrose Avenue series. (See the 'Ancient Ruin Sites' and 'People' in his web site.) = Still Life with Florals = Although maintaining his ongoing interests in Southwest ruins and landscape photography, Ray became increasingly attracted to photographing plucked flowers in contrived studio setups for what he called his ‚ÄúBotanical Studies‚Äù. Suitably arranging them with backdrops of photographic print paper patterned from randomly drizzled developer, he portrayed them undergoing graceful aging decay. He followed two main themes in these studies. One was direct portraits of the studio arrangements, bathed in luminous natural northern light with receding backgrounds that created the impression of magically floating in air. The second, much more complex, was achieved by juxtaposing a polaroid print of the subject plant with the real one arranged in a creative combination. The polaroid surfaces, some with amorphous shapes and blotches, formed distinctive framings for the flowers. Samples of these botanical studies are shown below; others are in his web site 'Botanical studies'.\\"McSavaney, Ray Web\\" At times McSavaney combined his search for suitable floral materials in the downtown Los Angeles flower market with a photography workshop at his studio. On such occasions he explained to his students the subject attributes he was looking for that would lead to an expressive print, samples of which are shown below. Although privately he may have considered them metaphors for the human condition, from youthful energetic beauty and vitality through old age wrinkling, deterioration, and inevitable death, he was somewhat philosophical about it. He merely observed that he found ‚Äúflowers can die in interesting ways‚Äù ‚Äî a typical McSavaney understatement. He observed that accidental defects in their parts sometimes produce ‚Äúan exciting and luminous image‚Äù. However, merely photographing florals ‚Äî fading, fresh or otherwise ‚Äî would have had minimal interest for McSavaney. Well versed as he was in art photography precedences, it's not unlikely that he would have been influenced by the symbolism expressed through the equivalents of Alfred Stieglitz and Minor White. Over several years, it's a very strong possibility that he may have found in his florals, subjects as profound as the equivalents that Stieglitz found in clouds and White in his \\"Song without Words\\".Minor White (1969), p42\\"  Photography teacher  =Interpretation of subject= For some Southwest subjects, McSavaney frequently resorted to high key printing. In that rendition, he faced a somewhat different technical problem by the need to further compress the subject tonal range into the three highest tonal values the paper could take. In order for it to work, he had to visualize the final print, then properly expose his negative to enable him to print it in the limited high-key tonal range; that is, he had to plan the complete end-to- end process in some detail. In those situations Adams' Zone System is most effective. Having learned at the feet of the master, McSavaney utilized Adams' principles of image management and value management to control the complete process. In Adams' explanation, such control allows a photographer to \\"visualize the different possible renderings of a subject at the film plane, and manage the image in such a way as to achieve the desired photographic interpretation.\\"Adams, Ansel, (1980)\\" - Ch 7\\"Ansel Adams, (1983)\\" - p176Easy as pie! Applying Adams‚Äô instructional approach in critiquing students‚Äô work, Adams, 1980 - Ch 5McSavaney's workshops attracted generations of large-format photographers. His non-judgmental evaluations of their photographs were authentic learning experiences. At times, he invited other well-known photographers as workshop instructors ‚Äì for examples Paul Caponigro, Michael Kenna and his former OVPW colleague John Sexton. Occasionally he invited talented writers and artists as joint instructors in his workshop program. A frequent participant was writer John Nichols, another the Santa Fe artist Carol Rose Brown, each a highly acclaimed practitioner of Southwestern themes. He well knew that their differing insights and viewpoints would enrich his students‚Äô experiences. Invariably, McSavaney encouraged his students to seek out other sources of instruction. Advising them to consider other large-format photographic workshops, even those of competitors, he was very generous in encouraging students' attempts to master the art of photography. He especially recommended the many programs offered by the Friends of Photography. Unfortunately now defunct, it was a treasured hub of fine art photography and exhibitions during the final three decades of the 20th century. Further exemplified by Adams, who distilled his encyclopedic knowledge of photography into the making of just 40 photographs,\\"Ansel Adams, (1983)\\" McSavaney was ever eager to share his professional techniques with fellow photographers and students. Bruce Barnbaum recounts how he learned his compensating development procedure from Ray. Parenthetically, Barnbaum also has a good discussion of the procedure in his own technical book and in his radiant \\"Visual Symphony\\".\\"Bruce Barnbaum (1994\\") - pp156, 82Bruce Barnbaum (1986)- NotesSimilarly,following in the photographic footsteps of Adams, his early assistant, John Sexton, holds back no secrets in describing how he makes his masterful photographs. In his poetically beautiful book, \\"Listen to the Trees\\", \\"John Sexton, (1994)\\"he provides a virtual playback of his printmaking procedure in making a print from a slightly uncooperative negative. He provides a graphic example of Adams representing the performance of the musical concert (making the print) from the score (the negative). Sexton makes it look easy. In addition to that singular example, he provides detailed technical information on producing each of the negatives from which the almost forty plates in his book are made. = Workshop materials = Ray's workshop students invariably received copies of his several darkroom technical innovations handouts. A typical example was ‚ÄúHighly Diluted HC-110 as a Film Developer‚Äù, another a checklist of his various techniques for controlling print contrast. He had created several developer recipes for his Tire Factory and Bunker Hills work and, as time went by, applied them in his landscape and Southwest photography. As with Adams, he kept no secret of his craft from his colleagues, students, or art magazine readers. Carefully and meticulously handwritten on 4x5 cards, McSavaney's printing notes are archived with his negatives. A valuable resource for any researcher, the notes illustrate in detail his field and darkroom methodologies. Ray McSavaney, Los Angeles graffiti site, late 90s, by Ken Karagozian http://www.kenkaragozian.com Although thoroughly steeped in Adam's photographic techniques, and no doubt enamored by his mastery of classical Western landscape photography, McSavaney in some ways resembled the late Rondal Partridge, teenage apprentice to Ansel Adams, ‚Äî and who, incidentally, flits in and out of his autobiography ‚Äî photographic assistant to Dorothea Lange, and son of Imogen Cunningham. LA Times (incomplete reference) Among some comparisons with McSavaney, Partridge made still lifes of decaying plants, and particularly specialized in showing 'humanity's encroachments\\", as the Times put it. Similarly, Ray's attraction to unsavory locales under the LA freeways and bridges allowed him to explore with artistic effect, a seamy side of the city. To paraphrase the words of the Times, neither one grew rich off his photographs. Instead, each had a lifetime's dedication to his craft; each put little-known parts of Los Angeles on the photographic map. = Making a photograph = When planning a photograph in the field, as if stalking his subject enacting Philip Hyde's motivation that \\"somewhere in this picture there's a photograph\\", McSavaney preferred to first inspect it from different locations and angles. It took him a while to make his photographs. At such times, no doubt an Adams' admonition was not far from his mind: \\"a very small change in camera position can make a great difference in the visual relationships within the photograph\\".Adams, 1983 - p 312 Peering at his subject through a cardboard cutout, rotating and extending it to frame the scene, his ‚Äòviewing frame‚Äô, with dimensions proportional to the classic 4x5 film, enabled McSavaney to select the best vantage point. By holding it at different viewing distances, it further allowed him to select the appropriate lens. Parenthetically, he somewhat emulated Adams in use of the viewing frame as an aid to composition.Ansel Adams, 1985 - p 312 Having decided on the most advantageous location, he dropped the frame and retrieved his equipment. Mounting the selected view camera lens, and submerging under his darkcloth, he adjusted the camera. Then, anticipating the decisive moment, if one existed in that context, he exposed his negatives. Concerned about altering the natural tonalities of a subject, he rarely used lens filters, with their concomitant irreversible effects on a negative. He would take care of any tonal dissonances later in the darkroom. McSavaney's preferred equipment was a lightweight wood field camera with a variety of lenses. He preferred a wide- angle lens ‚Äî his preference was a 90 mm ‚Äî because, as he said, it enabled him to get close to his subject. As they progressively became available, he used wide-angle lens up to the then latest 47 mm, enabling him to get even closer. Even at the risk of running out of loaded film holders, he usually made at least two exposures. Parenthetically, the necessity of carrying bulky film holders (anachronisms in the digital age) was considerably eased when Kodak's Readyload packets became available. McSavaney's spare negative was insurance against defects and allowed him to experiment with altering its tonalities in the darkroom as necessary for printing. Occasionally he made a Polaroid print on the spot to decide on the best exposure for critical scenes. In the pre- digital age, it was a rare serious photographer who ventured into the wilds of the Southwest without a trusty Polaroid 4x5 film-pack adapter and several boxes of film. (Must read: Ansel's relationship with Edwin Land and Polaroid in \\"Adams, Ansel, (1985)\\" - Ch 19). Many well-exposed polaroids are in McSavaney's archives. He was a very careful photographer, sparing no effort, always with the final print in mind. He practiced Adams‚Äô dictum, that analogous to orchestral music, the negative is merely the score whereas the print is the concert performance. Somewhat in the same vein, Oliver Gagliani, a good friend of Ansel, had a slightly different take by equating music to the language of the soul, photography to the language of the spirit. Bruce Barnbaum passionately equates his landscape photographs to his music. Few photographers stray far from Adams' analogy, or far from the sound of music. McSavaney discusses some of those printing techniques in his book. He well knew Adams' wry observation on the occasional necessity for the fine art landscape photographer to use drastic exposure and processing techniques. Ansel is rumored to have observed about a scene, ‚ÄòGod had a poor eye for tonal relationships‚Äô ‚Äî especially for esthetically pleasing tones of a fine-art photograph. McSavaney, Factory Butte, mid 90s, by Ken Karagozianhttp://www.kenkaragozian.com Briefly, after making preliminary proofs to evaluate the possibilities of his negative, McSavaney decided the degree, if any, that he needed to alter it to achieve the final tonalities he wanted, and the print paper, developer, and toner to achieve them. After making proof prints, he progressively evaluated the negative for necessary adjustments for which he used selenium toner or Spotone dyes, judiciously applied in localized areas. During the enlarging process, he applied burning and dodging\\"Adams, Ansel, (1983)\\" - Ch 5 as necessary ‚Äî again to satisfy his sensibilities of print tonalities and harmonies. He employed all ‚Äòthe tricks of the trade‚Äô in producing his final prints ‚Äî negative manipulation, selective exposure during printing, the combination of print paper, developer, and final toning that best expressed his vision for the print. The end result invariably was a well-conceived photograph, sometimes even a masterpiece. A writer attending a McSavaney print exhibition summarized his techniques, his overall artistic seeing, and talented creativity with one insightful word: ‚Äòcraftsmanship‚Äô.\\"Brownstein, Larry (2010)\\" = Photographic legacy = Ray McSavaney died in West Los Angeles Veteran's Hospital in July 2014.

She invented clothes irons with detachable wooden handles, and they were exhibited at the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition World's Fair and the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Her inventions were prominent throughout North America and the European continent in the 20th century and became the most popular heavy metal irons ever made. Potts received her first patent of an improved clothes iron at the age of 19. Her next patented invention was an improvement on that model a year later which featured a detachable wooden handle. It was produced and sold by American Machine Company as a four piece kit package of interchangeable parts. Her products were distributed through Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Company, and were manufactured until 1951.  Biography  Mary Florence Potts was born in Ottumwa, Iowa on November 1, 1850 to Jacob Hanec Webber (from Pennsylvania) and Anna Nancy McGinley (from Ohio). She married Joseph Potts at the age of 17 in 1867. Her first child was born in 1868, a son she named Oscero. Other children were born in Ottuma. Potts and her family moved from the Iowa town to Philadelphia in 1873. They had a total of six children. By 1890, they had moved to Camden, New Jersey, where her husband and Oscero worked as chemists. Her husband predeceased her in 1901, and she became the co-owner of Potts Manufacturing Company‚Äîwhich produced optical goods‚Äîwith Oscero by 1910. She died in Baltimore on June 24, 1922 and was buried at the New Camden Cemetry.  Inventions  Potts is associated with improvements to the sadiron that she started making from the age of 19. The old English word of sad before the \\"iron\\" meant heavy, dense, and solid. She had her first patent in 1870 for a wooden handle clothes iron of unique construction. Its design focused on convenience of use by replacing the metal handle which was prone to getting hot with a cool wooden one that was more comfortable to hold. The iron shape was double-pointed for operating in both directions and was made of hollow rather than solid metal. The flat bottom had a thick iron layer and the sides had thin sheets of iron. The hollow iron was to be filled with material that was a poor conductor of heat, such as cement or clay. Since her father was a plasterer by trade she experimented on filling some with a type of plaster of Paris. The advantage of these materials was that they did not radiate heat up to the user like its predecessor conventional solid metal iron did. The conventional solid metal clothes iron of the 19th century weighed around and had to be heated on a stove. It was so hot, that often a thick cloth mitt or rag was used to touch the metal handle to prevent burned fingers. A disadvantage of the conventional all-metal iron was that ironing had to stop when it would cool down and it had to be reheated. Potts made improvements to her 1870 invention and devised a mechanism to work around this problem. It was United States patent #113,448. It consisted of a detachable wooden handle and three iron bases of different sizes that could be connected to the handle. The advantage of Potts's 1871 universal standard system was that a used up cooled base could be switched out with a waiting heated base and the ironing could resume immediately. The concept for the different sizes of the base was for the purpose of a specific ironing task. The most pronounced feature of Potts's clothes iron was the detachable rounded wooden handle. That allowed the iron base to be placed on a heated stovetop and the handle removed at that time to stay away and cool while the base heated up. This prevented burned fingers, that often happened with the conventional all- solid-metal clothes iron of the 19th century. The design of the handle and bases were standard and could be easily reattached to various sizes after they were heated for a little delay in ironing. Potts termed herself as an \\"inventress\\" ‚Äî a Victorian expression. Initially, she sold her innovative clothes iron herself; it was later franchised out and manufactured by the American Machine Company of Philadelphia. The company marketed the clothes iron in a kit package that contained one wooden handle mechanism that attached to three iron bases. The handle could only connect to Potts's iron bases, in effect tripling sales of clothes irons over that of conventional solid metal irons. The kit also contained a trivet for placing a hot base on for times of rest. The Montgomery Ward catalog of 1894 offered a gift box of the Potts mechanism package for 90 cents. The Potts iron package was sold for 70 cents in 1896, and could be bought out of the Sears & Roebuck catalog for 78 cents in 1908. The mechanism was manufactured until 1951.  Legacy  Potts' double-pointed clothes iron became a standard household appliance widely used in the 20th century throughout North America and the European continent. Her patents of various styles of clothes irons were the most popular heavy metal irons ever made. The 1876 Philadelphia Exposition World's Fair displayed Potts's cold-handled sadiron. She lectured all throughout the United States promoting her cold-handled clothing iron mechanism. Her style of clothing irons became so popular that by 1891 special manufacturing machines were made that could mass produce thousands of semicircular wood handles in one day. Her innovative clothes iron was also a favorite item at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. The Pott's iron mechanism was used worldwide through the 20th century where electricity was not available. Her innovation of a removable handle mechanism in 1871 was later implemented by Gillette in 1901. Gillette applied the concept in the form of a removable and disposable blade, with the option to reinsert a sharper blade; this was a spin-off of Potts's removable cooled clothes iron base that could be reattached to a preheated base ready to go for ironing. This concept preceded the 20th century construction industry concept of portable hand tools with removable exhausted battery packs that could be reattached to fully charged batteries.

An area of low pressure developed near Guam on August 19, and two days later, the low reached tropical storm intensity as it moved generally west. Intensification was initially gradual, with Dinah becoming a typhoon early on August 24, before it subsequently intensified at a faster pace. Dinah reached its highest strength on August 26 before turning northward on August 28 and into a less favorable conditions aloft, which prompted weakening. Dinah entered the Sea of Japan after passing near Okinawa on August 29, where Dinah leveled off in intensity. The system then began to recurve towards southwestern Japan, and after tracking through the area, Dinah transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 31, although the remnants could be traced for four more days as it approached the International Date Line. Across Okinawa, one person was killed, and six more were injured; eight homes were destroyed or seriously damaged, and 13 boats sunk or were damaged. Damage exceeded $1.3 million (1987 USD). On the island of Kyushu, 250 homes were flooded and about 450,000 homeowners lost power. Throughout Japan, eight people perished, damage totaled $604 million and 89 were wounded. The typhoon destroyed nearly 40,000 dwellings and an additional 600 were flooded. In South Korea, 4,372 structures were destroyed, leaving more than 11,000 people homeless. Nationwide, the typhoon was responsible for flooding of crops. Property damage was estimated at $39.1 million. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Dinah can be traced back to a poorly organized area of disturbed weather that formed on August 18 close to Guam and was embedded in the monsoon trough, at the time situated near the equator. At 06:00 UTC on August 19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system, as the system started to show signs of organization. Shortly thereafter, a low pressure area developed along the axis of the system, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to start keeping an eye on the low. Late on August 20, there was a rapid increase in the coverage of the thunderstorm activity, and satellite intensity estimates via the Dvorak Technique reached T2.0/. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on August 21. Shortly after the upgrade, the depression began to turn west in response to a subtropical high to its north. The system then moved beneath an upper-level high, resulting in improved outflow and decreased wind shear. Following an increase in Dvorak classifications, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Storm Dinah on the evening of August 21. Early the following day, the JMA also upped the cyclone into a tropical storm. However, strong wind shear prevented intensification at the climatological rate of one T number per day, as the storm passed roughly south of Guam. Midday on August 23, the JMA declared Dinah a severe tropical storm. Shortly after the upgrade, Dinah began to enter an area of lower shear, which accelerated intensification. After turning west- northwest and an increase in the storm's Dvorak intensity estimates, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded Dinah into a typhoon on the morning of August 24. At the time of the upgrade, Dinah was located about west of Guam. Despite a brief increase in shear, Dinah began to rapidly intensify over the ensuing 24 hours. At 06:00 UTC on August 25, the JTWC increased the intensity of the typhoon to , equal to Category 3 status on the United States-based Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Early on August 26, the JTWC estimated that Dinah, while continuing northwest at a steady clip, obtained maximum sustained wind speed, with , making it a super typhoon. Even though data from the JTWC suggested that Dinah began to weaken almost immediately thereafter, the JMA estimated that Dinah reached its maximum sustained wind speed and minimum barometric pressure of and , respectively, at noon on August 26. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Luding. Typhoon Dinah's forward speed then began to slow as the storm approached a weakness in the ridge. Midday on August 28, Dinah began to turn north as it rounded the high. This change in the storm's direction led to the storm encountering stronger wind shear from a series of shortwave troughs that passed north of the storm, which redistricted the typhoon's outflow. This shear resulted in weakening, though the JTWC estimated the typhoon still had winds of as the storm passed approximately west of Kadena Air Base on the afternoon of August 29. Dinah then leveled off in intensity as the storm entered the Sea of Japan, and on August 30, Dinah began to recurve to the north-northeast. That day, the typhoon passed northwest of Sasebo Naval Base in western Japan while transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. By 00:00 UTC on August 31, Dinah began to merge with a frontal zone near the polar jet stream. Several hours later, the JTWC stopped monitoring the system as it completed its extratropical transition, but the JMA continuing to track the extratropical remnants of Dinah until September 3, when it crossed the International Date Line. Preparations and impact The storm lashed Okinawa Prefecture with strong winds of , and gusts of . The lowest sea level pressure observed on the island was , although offshore, a ship measured a pressure of . The capital of Okinawa, Naha, recorded of rain, including during one day; both of these totals were the highest reported across Japan. All ferry and airline service to Japan from Naha was halted. Throughout the capital of Okinawa, 13 fishing boats were damaged and three houses were destroyed. Throughout Okinawa, six people were injured, including one who required brief hospitalization from cuts as a result of flying glass. Police reported that eight houses were seriously damaged or destroyed. One person was killed and damage exceeded $1.3 million. Offshore, a ferry also sank, and a vessel and another ferry went aground. In all, Dinah was considered the worst tropical cyclone to affect Okinawa in 20 years. Along Kyushu, 250 homes were flooded and about 450,000 homeowners lost power. Off the coast of Kyushu, a vessel went aground and 41 boats were sunk. Throughout southwestern Japan, storm surge resulted in extensive damage to seawalls and piers. A landing craft from the was destroyed when the seawall eroded and the pier collapsed. Damage to United States military bases in the archipelago totaled $6.7 million. Nationwide, 37,0768 homes were destroyed, with 611 others flooded. A total of of crops was flooded and 79 ships were damaged due to Dinah. Eight people perished, and 89 others were hurt. Damage in Japan amounted to $604 million. Although Typhoon Dinah did not directly strike South Korea, the storm inundated much of the country, which was already affected by Typhoon Thelma six weeks earlier. In the South Chongchong Province, a peak rainfall total of was measured. The storm forced closure of 2,312 schools. Six people were killed when a small Buddhist temple collapsed due to heavy rains near Taegu, located southeast of Seoul, the officials said Offshore, a fishing boat sunk near Ulleungdo Island, located approximately east of Seoul, and left 32 fishermen missing, though one crewman was successfully rescued. Nationwide, 33 people were killed, 52 were unaccounted for, a total of 432 structures received flooded, and 4,372 buildings were destroyed, resulting in over 11,000 people homeless. Overall, the typhoon deluged of crops. Property damage was assessed at $39.1 million.

A manufacturer of dual-cyclonic type vacuum cleaners, they were inspired from the Dyson vacuums (which would not appear in North America until 2002). Its later name was adopted in 1995. Fantom went bankrupt in October 2001 and their vacuums have been considered collector's items since. History In 1989, British-born James Dyson (inventor of dual-cyclone vacuums) and Canada's IONA Appliances (the predecessor of Fantom Technologies) made a licensing deal in which the company would manufacture and sell a line of commercial dual-cyclonic upright vacuums called Vectron, for SC Johnson Wax, on which Dyson held the patent. Two years later, SC Johnson exited the commercial vacuum business and IONA renamed the vacuums to \\"Fantom\\". 1993 brought a successful infomercial for the original Fantom vacuum. One year later, the vacuum offered a HEPA filter as an option. In 1995, the vacuum was renamed the Fantom Thunder (AKA Kenmore Destiny). Later models *Fantom Fury In 1996, IONA Appliances became Fantom Technologies, Inc. and introduced the Fantom Fury. The vacuum was smaller than the Thunder unit and was lighter and less expensive. Again, it achieved success through a television infomercial. It was less able to clean carpets due to a weaker motor. *Fantom Lightning Fantom Technologies offered a canister-style vacuum in 1998 called the Fantom Lightning. It was sold at a price of $329 through a television infomercial hosted by Jim Caldwell (and produced by his then-business Future Thunder Productions). Again, it sold well, but the vacuum had defects including a like poor handle release on the power nozzle and poor wand and hose design. *Fantom Cyclone XT A later model was the Fantom Cyclone XT, released in 1999. Sold again through an infomercial hosted by Cheryl Watson and Jim Caldwell, the vacuum was engineered similar to the Lightning, but as upright. It was successful. *Fantom Crosswinds James Dyson ended his partnership with Fantom Technologies in early 2001. That same year, Fantom released a single-cyclone vacuum called the Fantom Crosswinds, which unlike the previous vacuums, was a failure due clogging problems. *Fantom Wildcat The Wildcat which is equivalent to Westinghouse Unplugged Bankruptcy and demise In October 2001, Fantom Technologies went bankrupt, and the name was sold to Euro-Pro (owned by Mark Rosenzweig).https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewcave/2014/12/29/how-shark-ate- dysons-lunch-in-americas-vacuum-cleaners-market/#8efa304c421f James Dyson saw an opportunity and introduced a multi-cyclonic vacuum under the Dyson name in North America in 2002, called the DC07, one year after Fantom went out of business. The Dyson DC07, as well as later Dyson models, would be commercial best-sellers in North America. Today, Fantom vacuums are considered collector's items.

It was popularized by the Joe Cuba Sextet, featuring Cheo Feliciano on vocals. In many instances, the song is referred to as being exclusively Joe Cuba's. The song is characterized for its bilingual lyrics and urban sound, all part of the Latin boogaloo music style of the late 1960s in New York City.  Writing and composition  The \\"I'll Never Go Back to Georgia\\" chant was taken from Dizzy Gillespie's intro to the Afro-Cuban jazz standard \\"Manteca\\". The piece refers to racial tensions in the United States. Jimmy Sabater Sr., has said however: \\"None of us had ever been to Georgia.\\" David Gonzalez from the New York Times writes: ‚Ä≥'Oye, ese pito!' Hey, that whistle! That was the first line to \\"El Pito,\\" which was always followed by five quick toots. In the mid-'60s those five notes heralded an emerging musical movement. From El Barrio to the South Bronx, hipsters in knit shirts and Caesar haircuts went around whistling, clapping and singing, \\"I'll never go back to Georgia! I'll never go back!\\" Of course, the farthest south most of these guys had ever been was Delancey Street to buy their Playboy loafers.‚Ä≥https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/nyregion/20wake.htm Nevertheless, Jimmy Sabater was \\"struck both by the sentiment and the way the cadence of the line perfectly fit a clave rhythm. And in 1965, when the song came out, the political timing was just right to make \\"El Pito\\" a rare crossover hit for Latin and black audiences\\".  Madison Square Garden performance According to a story published by record label Fania, to celebrate the success of the song, five thousand whistles were handed out during a concert at New York's Madison Square Garden in 1967. At the time, the Sextet was touring with the James Brown show. During the performance, the group ‚Ä≥hurled thousands of whistles from the stage, causing a mild uprising with people running down the aisles trying to get their hands on a Joe Cuba \\"El Pito\\" whistle.‚Ä≥ After the incident, James Brown reportedly decided never to tour with Joe Cuba again.

She was used to carry various cargoes, mainly grain, for the next 60 years. During the First World War she carried food and coal to the French Channel ports. During the Second World War Centaur was damaged when sailing to assist with the Dunkirk Evacuation. She did war work for the duration of the conflict. In 1945 she returned to the grain trade until 1955, when she was derigged. Between 1955 and 1966 she was used as a lighter until bought in 1966 by Richard Duke to re-rig as a charter barge. She was sold in 1973 to the charity Thames Barge Sailing Club (now the Thames Sailing Barge Trust). Restored between 1984 and 1993, and further in 2013, she now berths at Hythe Quay, Maldon. Description Thames sailing barges were commercial sailing vessels once common on the River Thames in London. The flat-bottomed barges with a shallow draught and leeboards, were well adapted to the shallow, narrow waters of the Thames Estuary and East Anglia. The larger barges were seaworthy vessels, and were the largest sailing vessel to be handled by just two men. The average size was about 120 tons and they carried from of canvas sail in six working sails. The mainsail was loose-footed and set up with a sprit, and was brailed to the mast when not needed. It was sheeted to a horse, as were the foresails, so needed no attention when going about (except that the foresail is held back by the mate when tacking to help the vessel come about). The topsail was usually the first sail on and last sail off, being fixed to the topmast by hoops. In the upper reaches of the rivers and constricted harbours it reached into clear air, to catch wind when the air was still at water level. When approaching a berth casting off the halliard would drop the topsail immediately, killing any forward motion. The mizzen boom was sheeted down to the long shallow rudder, which helped the vessels through the wind when tacking. The sails were made of flax; their rust colour came from the traditional waterproofing solution; a mixture of ochre, fish oil and urine. The masts were mounted in tabernacles so they could be lowered to pass under bridges without losing headway, with the anchor windlass used to lower and raise the gear via triple blocks. This took considerable effort and to aid in the process 'hufflers' were often used; they would come on board to help with raising the gear (for a fee). The bowsprit, where fitted, could be 'topped' ‚Äì raised ‚Äì where space was limited. Sails on a Thames barge The barges were wooden hulled, between long with a beam of around . The hull form was flat-bottomed with a degree of flare to the sides and plumb ends. To prevent unwanted (sideways) passage to the lee, there was a massive pivoted, retractable, winch operated leeboard on each side. On the Centaur each weighed . The stern was a transom, fitted with a large rudder. The hull was mainly a hold with two small living areas in the bow and stern, and access was through two large hatchways, the smaller before the main mast and a much larger aperture behind. These barges required no ballast. No auxiliary power was used originally but many barges were fitted with engines in later years. When no wharf was available, the barge could use the ebbing tide to stand on the mud close to shore, and offload its cargo into carts. A barge with no topsail ‚Äì or top mast ‚Äì sailing stumpy-rigged required a smaller crew. With a shallow draught, they could penetrate deep into the back waters. Not needing ballast reduced their turn-round time. They could be berthed on a flat mud bank, against a camp-shed, on a barge bed or in a held tide dock. In good conditions, sailing barges could attain speeds of over , and their leeboards allowed them to be highly effective windward performers. The unusual spritsail rig allowed any combination of sails to be set: even the topsail on its own could be effective in some conditions. =Uses= Thames sailing barges were the heavy goods vehicles of their time, moving of loose cargo at a time from outside the capital to the city. They brought in coal for the furnaces, bricks to construct mills and houses, and hay for the horses. Barges were used to transport rubbish from various cities out to the brickfields where it was used as fuel; it was only for the last mile of the trip to the brickfields that road transport had to be used. In 1900 there were over 2,000 privately owned Thames sailing barges in operation. History Foulness Point, Essex: Admiralty Chart SC5606, April 2004 =Early life= SB Centaur, wood built, probably pitch pine on oak, was constructed for Charles Stone of Mistley to be used for the coastal trade. She was large compared with the average sailing barge and had a \\"generous sheer and shapely transom\\" making her more seaworthy. She was long, with a beam of and a draught of . Her capacity was . When loaded she could have as little as freeboard, and hurried loading meant that she frequently listed. Construction took six weeks and she was launched on 15February 1895 by John and Herbert Cann at the Bathside yard, Gashouse Creek, Harwich. Her first master was James Stone, and she had a crew of two: a mate and a boy. There was another Thames sailing barge named Centaur, based in Rochester and built in 1899. She sank in 1930 after colliding with Aspbodel. Records referring to \\"SB Centaur\\" are not always clear as to which is meant. In 1898 Centaur won the Harwich Barge Race. In 1899 an \\"SB Centaur\\", probably her Rochester-based namesake, won the Medway Barge Race, passing over the finishing line at Upnor minutes ahead of second placed SB Giralda. The Mistley barges worked the ports of north east France, Belgium and the Netherlands, from most of the English ports between Southampton and Goole. There are records of her carrying wheat, hydrochloric acid, sugar, linseed oil and raw linseed. In April 1902 her steering gear was damaged while sailing from Shoreham and she was towed into Newhaven. In January 1905 she had to be towed into Portland. Both anchors were lost off the Netherlands in December 1906. Her sailing qualities have been described as: =World War I= SB Edme, a similar barge to Centaur, under full sailThe staysail and the jib are white, not red-brown, because they were stowed below deck and so did not require the ultra-violet protection provided by adding ochre to the waterproofing solution which resulted in the distinctive colour of the other sails. In the First World War, SB Centaur joined her sister barges taking foodstuffs and large quantities of coal, coke, and pitch to the French ports of Le Treport, Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer. Commonly there were 180 barges discharging at Le Treport. They sailed over enemy mines due to their shallow draught, and were too small to attract enemy U-boats. These were profitable runs as carriage was charged at ¬£6 a ton. On one crossing, the date is not recorded, in thick fog, the Centaur was struck amidships by a coastal motor boat (CMB), a small, motorised, military vessel, which mounted her deck and settled on her main hatch. Both boats were undamaged and the Centaur returned home and safely unloaded both the CMB and her cargo. =Inter-war years= After the war, Centaur resumed the coastal trade. She made a number of voyages to France and Belgium carrying pitch and coal. Ephraim Cripps was her skipper for twenty years and kept records of each voyage. Colchester was her main port from 1928 to 1930, and she worked the East Anglian coast. In 1933 she joined Francis and Gilders Ltd which managed a large fleet of sailing barges out of Colchester, transporting grain from Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex into London. =World War II= SB Centaur in 2017 at Hythe Quay, Maldon The first major civilian maritime event of the Second World War was the Dunkirk evacuation where hundreds of small ships rescued allied soldiers from the beaches. Like many of the sailing barge fleet Centaur sailed down to the assembly point at Dover, where she collided with a tug and so was unable to make the crossing. The rest of the conflict was spent under government charter, carrying much the same cargos as she always had around the south and east coasts of England. =Post- war= After the war Centaur returned to working the grain trade. In January 1952, in force 6‚Äì7 winds with seas breaking across her hatches, her rudder broke and she was towed into Colne by the SB Saxon. Francis and Gilders Ltd were the last \\"seeker barges\\", barges that sought any cargo; the London and Rochester Trading Company merged with them in 1951. The new owners were intent on selling on these barges, and Centaur took her last cargo in 1955. During her last year in the carrying trade, as well as grain she transported timber, sugar beet, ballast, cement and oil drums. Centaur and the other three remaining working sailing barges, George Smeed, Kitty and Mirosa were deregistered and disposed of to Brown & Son of Chelmsford. There they were de- masted, de-registered and used as timber lighters. Between 1955 and 1966 she was used as a lighter to tranship timber from ships in the Blackwater estuary to canal lighters headed for Chelmsford. In 1966 she was purchased by Richard Duke and re-rigged as a charter barge with four four-berth cabins. In 1968 she was class winner at the Blackwater Sailing Barge Match. She was sold in 1973 to the Thames Barge Sailing Club (now the Thames Sailing Barge Trust), a registered charity. She was restored between 1974 and 1993, with most frames and planks replaced and a new auxiliary motor, a Bedford six-cylinder truck engine fitted with a marine gearbox, installed. In 1993 she won the Inter- match Trophy. In 1995 the sacrificial planking was replaced in iroko and opeipi. In 2013 a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of ¬£100,000 was obtained which contributed to further restoration work, including redoubling the bottom timbers. She now berths at Hythe Quay, Maldon and is available for charter during the summer months. She is still traditionally rigged, as she was in 1895, currently with of sail.

In each subunit, intramolecular disulfide bonds are shown as yellow sticks. The intramolecular disulfide bond at the dimer interface is shown as green and yellow spheres. Irditoxin is a three-finger toxin (3FTx) protein found in the venom of the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) and likely in other members of the genus Boiga. It is a heterodimer composed of two distinct protein chains, each of the three-finger protein fold, linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond. This structure is unusual for 3FTx proteins, which are most commonly monomeric.  Structure  Three-finger toxin (3FTx) proteins canonically consist of approximately 60-80 amino acid residues that assume a structure with three \\"finger\\"-like beta strand-containing loops projecting from a core stabilized by four intramolecular disulfide bonds. Irditoxin is a covalent heterodimer in which two subunits are linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond. Each subunit is of the three-finger toxin (3FTx) protein superfamily and is most closely related to the \\"non-conventional\\" 3FTx subclass, characterized by the presence of an additional disulfide bond in the first of the canonical three \\"finger\\" loops. Each subunit thus contains 11 cysteine residues: the eight canonical residues that form the core disulfide bonds, the two in the first loop forming the non-conventional disulfide, and the one that forms the dimeric linkage. Irditoxin subunits A and B are 75 and 77 amino acid residues long, respectively, and each possess a seven-residue extension with a pyroglutamic acid post-translational modification at the N-terminus. Irditoxin's structure is highly unusual within the 3FTx superfamily. Most 3FTx proteins are monomers. The best-studied exception is kappa-bungarotoxin, a non-covalent homodimer with a very different protein- protein interaction surface; the recently described alpha-cobratoxin also forms both covalent homodimers and low-abundance covalent heterodimers with other 3FTx proteins found in monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia) venom. It is as yet unclear how irditoxin's two subunits contribute to its biological activities.  Function  Irditoxin is an abundant protein in the venom of the brown tree snake and accounts for about 10% of the protein found in venom samples of brown treesnakes collected from Guam, where they are an invasive species. Irditoxin's toxic effects are highly species-dependent; in laboratory tests, it is highly toxic to lizards and birds but not to mammals. Although the molecular mechanism of toxicity is not clear, irditoxin produces robust post-synaptic blockade of signaling in the avian neuromuscular junction. Discovery and nomenclature Irditoxin was first described in 2009 after isolation from samples of venom from the brown tree snake. Its name is a contraction of \\"B. irregularis dimeric toxin\\". Other Boiga species, and possibly other colubrid snakes, likely possess homologous proteins.

Blackbird, an online journal of literature and the arts, posted multiple interviews with Carlyon. In 2002, its editor Mary Flinn chatted with Carlyon in the Blackbird editorial office at Virginia Commonwealth University. They discussed the origin of Flight Song, the influence of John Cage, and \\"the use of video in art, to the state of art as we move into the twenty-first century.\\" Flinn visited with Richard Carlyon again in 2006 to discuss his retrospective show at the Reynolds Gallery in Richmond, Virginia. In that interview, they discussed the importance of placement of the paintings and drawings in the gallery space, the relationship of dance and painting, and other issues surrounding Carlyon's work and process. Reviewer Edwin Slipek in his STYLE theatre article, \\"The Long Goodbye\\", used the subtitle \\"The late Richard Carlyon set the bar for artistic exploration, integrity and influence\\". In January and February 2018 both Reynolds Gallery and the Virginia Commonwealth University Cabell Library honored Carlyon with retrospective exhibitions and viewings of projected images of his films.

The series was ordered on May 12, 2017. The series is a co-production between Universal Cable Productions and Netflix. Netflix streamed the show worldwide outside the United States, where it aired on USA Network. The series premiered on November 7, 2017. On January 25, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after one season. Plot Set in 1931 amidst the American labor wars of the Great Depression, Damnation follows Seth Davenport, a man with a violent past who poses as a preacher as he rallies townsfolk to stand up against greedy industrialists and the corruption of the local bank, sheriff's department, and newspaper. He is opposed by Creeley Turner, an ex-con who works for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency and has been hired by a rich industrialist to stop Davenport's strike. Neither the townsfolk nor the industrialists know that Seth and Creeley are estranged brothers. According to creator and showrunner Tony Tost, Damnation is \\"1/3 Clint Eastwood, 1/3 John Steinbeck, 1/3 James Ellroy. That is, it takes some characters you‚Äôd normally see in a tough western, plops them in the world of Grapes of Wrath, and places them in the sort of pulpy paranoid narrative you see in Ellroy‚Äôs novels.\\" Background The Farmers' Holiday Association campaign for a farm strike in the early 1930s was the event on which the story is based; the Iowa locale in the series is based on Plymouth County, Iowa during this time, the strike and related events in the county seat of Le Mars, Iowa and rural areas of the county beginning in early May 1932. This was also the period when the penny auction became a common farmer tactic. A coal miners' strike at the same time in Kentucky, known as the Harlan County War or Bloody Harlan, is the basis for that element of the plot. The Sheriff J. H. Blair and Florence Reece are historical characters, with Reece's folk song \\"Which Side Are You On?\\" (performed in the second episode) being inspired by Sheriff Blair's actions during the Harlan County War. The Pinkerton Detective Agency, which employs Creeley Turner and the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, which employs Connie Nunn, are real agencies that focused on strikebreaking in the 1930s. The villainous Black Legion vigilante group in Damnation is based on the 1930s militant fascistic paramilitary group of the same name. The Black Legion terrorized ethnic, political and religious minorities throughout the Midwest, targeting labor organizers and striking workers in particular. Cast =Main= * Killian Scott as Seth Davenport, an enigmatic preacher with a mysterious past, who is behind the strikes in Holden County. * Logan Marshall-Green as Creeley Turner, Seth's older brother and a Pinkerton Detective. * Sarah Jones as Amelia Davenport, Seth's politically radical wife, who writes inflammatory sermons under the alias \\"Dr. Samuel T. Hopkins.\\" * Chasten Harmon as Bessie Louvin, an African-American prostitute at the local brothel, who is literate and cunning, and is hired by Creeley to be his secretary. * Christopher Heyerdahl as Don Berryman, the amoral local sheriff of Holden, who also runs the town's bootlegging and gambling operations. * Melinda Page Hamilton as Connie Nunn, a cold-blooded and murderous agent of the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, who believes that Seth Davenport killed her strikebreaking husband. * Joe Adler as D. L. Sullivan, a reporter for the town's local newspaper, who nurses literary ambitions. =Recurring= * Paul Rae as Melvin Stubbs, a local food distributor who is campaigning against Don Berryman in the election for local sheriff. * Phillipa Domville as Martha Riley, the wife of Sam Riley, the late leader of the farmers' strike. * David Haysom as Deputy Raymond Berryman, Sheriff Don Berryman's dimwitted and occasionally brutal nephew. * Dan Donohue as Calvin Rumple, a corrupt local banker who is fixing food prices in the county. * Tom Butler as Burt Babbage, the editor of the local newspaper, who is refusing to report on the farmers' strike. * Juan Javier Cardenas as Lew Nez, a childhood friend of Seth and Creeley, who is now wanted for bank robbery. * Arnold Pinnock as Victor, an African-American dairy farmer and military veteran. * Teach Grant as Preston Riley, the drunken cousin of Sam Riley, the late leader of the farmers' strike. * Gabriel Mann as Martin Eggers Hyde, PhD, a highly educated fixer for the industrialist Duvall family, who controls Creeley Turner's actions and fate. * Zach McGowan as Tennyson Duvall, an ambitious, art-loving philanthropist heir to the Duvall family fortune. * Timothy V.

Production Originally, Aden Young was set to play the lead role, but he dropped out due to creative differences and was later replaced by Killian Scott. Episodes Reception Reviews for the show were positive to mixed. Alan Sepinwall wrote: \\"Tost and company do a nice job illustrating all the people in the story ‚Äî usually women ‚Äî pushing up against barriers that go beyond economics...The men dominate the story because of the era and the type of show this is, but the women feel much more complex and original. Emily VanDerWerff wrote that at Damnation's center \\"is a world and time period that TV hasn‚Äôt ever explored as thoroughly as it could, and it‚Äôs clear that all involved (but especially creator Tony Tost) have done their research. The same growing pains that nearly all dramas face are clear and evident, but Damnation has a setting and point of view...Slow-moving and enamored of its own darkness as Damnation is, there‚Äôs something vital and real in the show‚Äôs insistence that the United States‚Äô institutions have failed and are only looking out for themselves.\\" Alexis Gunderson compared Damnation favorably to Netflix's Godless, writing that \\"Damnation actually followed through on its promise to interrogate the corruption of capitalism and racism and the gulf of messy morality between what is good for the individual and what is good for society.\\" Mark Dawidziak of the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote that the show feels like \\"a powerful collaboration between Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck and pioneering mystery writer Dashiell Hammett...Although set during the Depression, \\"Damnation\\" is a series packing a tremendous thematic punch for 2017 viewers.\\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 64% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.36/10 based on 25 reviews.

At age 36, he became president of McCormick & Company, which he led for 23 years, building it into an international spices and flavorings company. He became known for his progressive Multiple Management system and for his civic involvement in the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland at large.  Biography  Born in Morelia, Mexico in 1896, McCormick was the son of the Baptist missionary Hugh Pendleton McCormick and Anne Pauline (Perry) McCormick. He lived with his family in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Birmingham, Alabama, Paris and back in the States in Baltimore. After regular education in those places, he finished his secondary schooling in the Class of 1915 at The Baltimore City College, an all-boys institution, the nation's third oldest public high school, founded 1839, and then located in its second building on the site at North Howard and West Centre Streets. He later graduated from The Johns Hopkins University in 1919. then in its first years at its new campus at Homewood in north Baltimore.Who was who in America, Vol. 5, 1973, p. 474 After graduation, McCormick started a regular four year apprenticeship in a factory and offices of McCormick & Company, his uncle's spice firm. McCormick had already earlier started part-time in the summer of 1912 as shipping department clerk. After gaining sales experience in the Middle West and Pacific Coast section, McCormick was appointed head of the import-export department in Baltimore. In 1928 he was promoted vice president in 1928, and after the death of his uncle Willoughby M. McCormick in 1932, he was elected president of McCormick & Company. McCormick retired in 1969 and was named Chairman Emeritus. McCormick participated in a series of business and civic affairs. He was member of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in 1939 and its chairman in 1952; chairman of the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland; director of several banks in and around Baltimore; and National Councilor to the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. In 1960, McCormick was awarded the 1960 Henry Laurence Gantt Medal by the American Management Association and the ASME. Robert G. Hess, chairman of the Gantt Medal Board of Award, gave a presentation, that the award was offered him for being \\"a dynamic leader in business; a successful practitioner of modern principles of scientific management and valuable contributor of accepted improvements to the management profession, encompassing the humanities without sacrifice of profitable corporate performance and in addition, to influential leadership in the local community and national affairs.\\"Charles M.

He was also selected for the Alumni Hall of Fame for his high school, The Baltimore City College.  Early life  Charles Perry McCormick was born on June 9, 1896, in Morelia, Mexico. The son of Baptist missionary Reverend Hugh Pendleton McCormick and Anne Pauline McCormick (n√©e Perry), he had two older siblings, Catherine (Katie) and Hugh. Following his peripatetic father, he attended primary school in Puerto Rico (where his father founded the University of Puerto Rico); grammar school in Birmingham, Alabama, and Boston, Massachusetts; and high school in Paris, France; Hamilton, Virginia; and Baltimore, Maryland. He matriculated to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University in 1916, but his studies were interrupted by the Great War.  Naval career  McCormick enlisted in the United States Navy on April 6, 1917. He served aboard the U.S.S. W. A. Edwards and the U.S.S. Edgar F. Luckenbach. He also served as Naval Athletic Director, Fifth Naval District, for nine months.  Return to Baltimore  After his short naval career, McCormick returned to Johns Hopkins in 1919 to complete his education. Upon graduation, he went to work full-time for his uncle Willoughby M. McCormick's business, McCormick & Co., where he had already worked summers as a high school and a college student.  Background  McCormick and Co. was founded in 1889 by Willoughby M. McCormick. The elder McCormick is said to have run the company with an \\"iron hand\\" The Cover. (1949, June 11). Business Week. and during the Great Depression he cut salaries across the board, first by 25%, then a further 10%. Upon his sudden death in 1932, the company's directors tapped 36-year-old Charles McCormick to replace his uncle.  Career  The younger McCormick worked his way from hauling cratesPouder, G. H.

Along the way he had moved up to sales, to supervising four sales offices, to opening the West Coast markets. (According to The American Weekly, McCormick disliked the \\"too-dingy or too- shiny reception rooms\\" he often waited in during his years traveling for McCormick & Co. Later, after becoming president of the firm, he remade the seventh floor of McCormick's factory building into a replica of an Elizabethan English village street, including a teahouse where tea would be served to guests.) Upon being named president of McCormick & Co., Charles McCormick promptly raised salaries 10%, cut the work week from 56 hours to 45, and solicited suggestions for improvements. These actions raised morale and brought McCormick & Co. into the black for the first time in four years. He would soon transform the company's top-down organizational structure with a plan he called Multiple Management.  Multiple Management  Multiple Management was a profit-sharing plan designed as a way to develop and promote leaders from within the organization, as well as to solicit input from a wider cross-section of employees. The American Weekly called it a \\"most extraordinary industrial democracy\\". A junior board made of young executives, a factory board made of foremen and section heads, and a board of salesmen would propose recommendations to improve materials, packaging, processes, and sales and advertising. These would be reviewed by a senior board, who approved the vast majority of the proposals. A joint Combined Board would facilitate communication among all the other boards. Under Multiple Management, more than 7,000 suggestions were sent from the junior board to the senior board between 1932 and 1948. Suggestions ranged from new bottles and tins, \\"snappier\\" labels, and improvements in machinery, inventory, and quality control. In that time, sales rose from US$3.25 million to US$26 million, and by 1935 McCormick was the largest spice and flavoring-extract business in the U.S. By 1962, net sales amounted to US$50 million yearly. McCormick collated his ideas in two books: Multiple Management in 1937, and a follow-up, Power of People, in 1949. He wrote: > \\"Too many bankers and industrialists associate with their own clique > exclusively; too many labor men travel only with their fellows. There's > nothing wrong with capitalism, but there's a lot wrong with some of the > people who use it. American living is the best the world has ever seen. But > of what lasting use will it be if we do not learn how to get along better > with one another?\\" That same year, Business Week reported: \\"To this date, more than 500 companies in 46 countries have made inquiries or adopted the MM plan.\\"  Retirement  McCormick retired as president of McCormick & Co. in 1955.Charles P.

In a dryly appreciative biographical sketch subtitled \\"Man With A Mission\\" in Baltimore magazine, G. H. Pouder wrote, \\"Charles Perry McCormick believes that achievement comes only with serving and for that reason has tackled an appalling list of jobs for the public good, which can only be described as headaches of the first water.\\" Similarly, his obituary in The Evening Sun began, \\"It took 69 lines of type in Who's Who to list Charles P. McCormick's memberships, awards and attainments and only the more important ones at that.\\" Among his more notable accomplishments, he was selected to represent U.S. management at the conference of the International Labor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland from 1949 to 1952; he was also vice chairman of the conference in 1955. He also served as chairman of the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore. He was appointed a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland under three consecutive governors from 1948‚Äì1966. A lover of football, he was one of the businessmen who helped establish the Baltimore Colts and served as Chairman of the first Colts Football Club, and he set up an annual award to the \\"Unsung Hero\\" of Maryland interscholastic football.  Personal life  McCormick married Marion Andrews Hinds on October 14, 1921. They had two children, Rosalie Anne and Charles Perry, Jr. They divorced in November 1943, and later that month, on November 27, McCormick married Anne Wollman McPhail in New York. They had two more children, John Grayson and Robert Newton. At the time of his death he was survived by seven grandchildren. McCormick painted seascapes, drew his own Christmas cards, and carved wooden statuettes as gifts.  Death  On June 14, 1970, McCormick suffered a heart attack and was taken to University Hospital in Baltimore. He died on June 16, 1970 at 5 P.M.

First described by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1784, it is common across much of Europe, North America and New Zealand, and more patchily distributed in South America, Asia, Australia and Antarctica. There are 2 subspecies, P. c. caesia and P. c. ventosa, as well as a number of distinct forms and varieties. Molecular studies suggest that the species as currently defined may be polyphyletic. It is typically pale gray shading to darker gray in the center (though some forms are considerably darker), and grows in a small rosette, usually some across at maturity. It only rarely has apothecia, instead reproducing most often vegetatively via soredia, which are piled in round blue-gray mounds across the thallus's upper surface. It grows most often on rock‚Äîprincipally calcareous, but also basaltic and siliceous‚Äîand also occurs on bone, bark and soil. It is nitrophilic and is particularly common on substrates where birds perch. Capable of growing at a multitude of angles on a variety of surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high temperatures of desert locations to the low temperatures of the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites. Taxonomy Physcia caesia was first described by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1784 as Lichen caesius. Other lichenologists assigned it to various other genera both before and after it was moved into its current genus by Georg Ernst Ludwig Hampe in 1839. It has 2 subspecies, P. c. caesia and P. c. ventosa, as well as a number of distinct forms and varieties, some of which were thought to be distinct species in the past. Although this species and Physcia aipolia have been considered a species pair, some molecular studies suggest that they should instead be considered conspecific. Other molecular studies suggest that both Physcia caesia and Physcia aipolia are polyphyletic taxa, with various forms more closely related to other species than to each other. The genus name Physcia means \\"inflated\\" or \\"sausage-like\\", referring to the form of the type species. The specific epithet caesia is a Latin word meaning \\"blue-gray\\". Physcia caesia is known colloquially as blue-gray rosette lichen and powder-back lichen. Description Physcia caesia is a foliose lichen that forms small rosettes, typically measuring across at maturity, though it can reach diameters of up to . The thallus is pale gray shading to darker gray in the center, and adheres closely to the substrate on which it grows. Its convex lobes are linear, typically measuring in width, though occasionally as wide as . Forms in some areas, including Greenland, can be considerably darker, with a thallus ranging from gray to dark gray; they can also have broader or narrower lobes. The lichen's surface is white-spotted, though this is not always obvious. It has blue-gray soredia, which are piled in round mounds (such aggregations are known as soralia) across the thallus's upper surface. The lower surface is white to brown with short, dark rhizines. Physcia caesia only rarely has apothecia. Where present, these are black discs measuring up to across, with prominent thalline margins (which means the thallus extends up around the edges of the apothecia) and a grayish pruinescence. Each ascus contains 8 spores, which are thick-walled and brown, measuring x . Its photobiont is the green algae Trebouxia impressa, a species associated with many Physcia lichens. The lichen's cortex and medulla react positively with potassium hydroxide (K), turning yellow. Cortex and medulla react positively with para-phenylenediamene (Pd) as well, also turning yellow. They produce no reaction with calcium or sodium hypochlorite (bleach ‚Äì C), nor with KC (potassium hydroxide quickly followed by bleach). Among the substances produced by the lichen are atranorin and zeorin. =Similar species= Physcia caesia was long considered to be a species pair with the very similar Physcia aipolia; the latter is regularly covered with black apothecia, and typically grows epiphytically. Physcia caesia may also be confused with Physcia poncinsii, but the latter has \\"crateriform\\" (hollowed, like a bowl or saucer) rather than rounded soralia, and obviously convex lobes. It may also be confused with Physcia dubia which, like Physcia caesia, can be quite variable; however, P. dubia has lip-shaped soralia (which tend to be primarily apical), and its thallus does not react with potassium hydroxide. Distribution and habitat Physcia caesia on rock on St. Paul Island, Alaska Physcia caesia is widespread across much of the world, found in Arctic, boreal and temperate vegetation zones. Widely distributed across Europe, it is one of the most common species of Physcia in Greenland, and is abundant throughout Britain. Though found across much of North America, it is absent from central and southeastern United States, parts of the Great Basin, and northern Alaska. In South America, it is found in Argentina, Chile, and Peru; common and widespread in temperate areas, it occurs only rarely and only at elevations above in tropical regions. It occurs patchily across Asia‚Äîin India, Bhutan, Nepal and Japan‚Äîas well as in East Africa. It is described as \\"cosmopolitan\\" in New Zealand, has been reported from a number of sites in southeastern Australia and Tasmania, and also occurs in Antarctica. It is common on calcareous substrates, growing on limestone (including tufa) and concrete. It also grows on basaltic and siliceous rock, as well as on bone. It is particularly common on rocks where birds perch and defecate. It is uncommon on bark; however, in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, it is one of the predominant lichens on juniper trees, growing primarily within of the ground on the northern and eastern side of trunks. In Antarctica, it grows on mosses, soil and gravel, and may be among the species contributing to the formation of a soil crust on the continent. In California, it is found in montane and subalpine forests ranging from in elevation. Ecology Physcia caesia tolerates a variety of locations, occurring on vertical, angled and horizontal surfaces, as well as rocky overhangs. It is found on both dry stone and stone moistened by seepage, and can tolerate being irregularly submerged underwater. It survives in hot desert conditions, primarily on the north side of slopes. It also thrives in cold conditions, and is able to photosynthesize at temperatures as low as . Like many lichens that grow on rocky substrates, Physcia caesia is able to accumulate a number of necessary nutrients‚Äîincluding nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and iron‚Äîfrom the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. Its hyphae can extend into substrate as much as . It is a nitrophyte and can tolerate higher levels of atmospheric ammonia than can many other species of lichen, because it can survive on substrates with a higher pH. It has been recorded growing on a lead surface (probably a weathered oxide). Physcia caesia is known to accumulate high concentrations of heavy metals, including chromium, zinc, copper and iron. It is slow-growing, with an increase in size of only per year for a colony observed in one study. Foliose lichens such as Physcia caesia are intermediate in their response to air pollution ‚Äî less sensitive than fruticose lichens, but more sensitive than crustose lichens. Physcia caesia is found in cities, though at lower frequencies than more pollution-tolerant species. In Greenland, it often grows in association with other lichen species tolerant of enriched environments, including Umbilicaria arctica, Xanthoria candelaria, Xanthoria elegans, Physcia dubia, and Rhizoplaca melanophthalma. In Poland, it is part of bryophyte communities found on asbestos tile roofs, occurring with Tortula ruralis, Orthotrichum anomalum, Grimmia pulvinata, Schistidium apocarpum and others. As with most lichens, Physcia caesia is impacted by habitat loss through development, as well as by the trampling or overgrowth of its location. However, the retention of old stone walls, buildings and bridges can help to support its populations, even in cities. Physcia caesia is attacked by lichenicolous fungi, including Polycoccum galligenum, Polycoccum pulvinatum, Zwackhiomyces physciicola and Arthonia epiphyscia.

It was leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group on April 14, 2017, one month after Microsoft released patches for the vulnerability. On May 12, 2017, the worldwide WannaCry ransomware used this exploit to attack unpatched computers. On June 27, 2017, the exploit was again used to help carry out the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack on more unpatched computers. The exploit was also reported to have been used since March 2016 by the Chinese hacking group Buckeye (APT3), after they likely found and re-purposed the tool, as well as reported to have been used as part of the Retefe banking trojan since at least September 5, 2017. EternalBlue was among the several exploits used, in conjunction with the DoublePulsar backdoor implant tool. Details EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This vulnerability is denoted by entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) catalog. The vulnerability exists because the SMB version 1 (SMBv1) server in various versions of Microsoft Windows mishandles specially crafted packets from remote attackers, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the target computer. The NSA did not alert Microsoft about the vulnerabilities, and held on to it for more than five years before the breach forced its hand. The agency then warned Microsoft after learning about EternalBlue's possible theft, allowing the company to prepare a software patch issued in March 2017, after delaying its regular release of security patches in February 2017. On Tuesday, March 14, 2017, Microsoft issued security bulletin MS17-010, which detailed the flaw and announced that patches had been released for all Windows versions that were currently supported at that time, these being Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016. Many Windows users had not installed the patches when, two months later on May 12, 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack used the EternalBlue vulnerability to spread itself. The next day (May 13, 2017), Microsoft released emergency security patches for the unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003. In February 2018, EternalBlue was ported to all Windows operating systems since Windows 2000 by RiskSense security researcher Sean Dillon. EternalChampion and EternalRomance, two other exploits originally developed by the NSA and leaked by The Shadow Brokers, were also ported at the same event. They were made available as open sourced Metasploit modules. At the end of 2018, millions of systems were still vulnerable to EternalBlue. This has led to millions of dollars in damages due primarily to ransomware worms. Following the massive impact of WannaCry, both NotPetya and BadRabbit caused over $1 billion worth of damages in over 65 countries, using EternalBlue as either an initial compromise vector or as a method of lateral movement. In May 2019, the city of Baltimore struggled with a cyberattack by digital extortionists using EternalBlue. The attack froze thousands of computers, shut down email and disrupted real estate sales, water bills, health alerts and many other services. Since 2012, four Baltimore City chief information officers have been fired or have resigned; two left while under investigation. Some security researchers said that the responsibility for the Baltimore breach lay with the city for not updating their computers. Security consultant Rob Graham wrote in a tweet: \\"If an organization has substantial numbers of Windows machines that have gone 2 years without patches, then that‚Äôs squarely the fault of the organization, not EternalBlue.\\" Responsibility According to Microsoft, it was the United States's NSA that was responsible because of its controversial strategy of not disclosing but stockpiling vulnerabilities. The strategy prevented Microsoft from knowing of (and subsequently patching) this bug, and presumably other hidden bugs. EternalRocks EternalRocks or MicroBotMassiveNet is a computer worm that infects Microsoft Windows. It uses seven exploits developed by the NSA. Comparatively, the WannaCry ransomware program that infected 230,000 computers in May 2017 only uses two NSA exploits, making researchers believe EternalRocks to be significantly more dangerous. The worm was discovered via honeypot. =Infection= EternalRocks first installs Tor, a private network that conceals Internet activity, to access its hidden servers. After a brief 24 hour \\"incubation period\\", the server then responds to the malware request by downloading and self-replicating on the \\"host\\" machine.

After an early access phase beginning in 2015, the game was released for Microsoft Windows and macOS on July 25, 2018. A tentative port for Linux was canceled, along with several \\"stretch goals\\" from its crowdfunding campaign.  Gameplay  Stonehearth features a procedurally-generated world where players manage a colony of people called \\"Hearthlings\\". Players are tasked with caring for their hearthlings including, feeding, sheltering, and defending them from the dangers like orcs and skeletons.  Development  Stonehearth was developed by Radiant Entertainment, a company founded by Tom and Tony Cannon, co-founders of the fighting game eSports event Evolution Championship Series. Described as a \\"passion project\\" by Tom Cannon, the brothers spent two years making a prototype before creating a Kickstarter campaign to fund the creation in 2013. Asking for $120,000, the campaign ended with $751,920 and 22,844 backers. After the success of the Kickstarter, the development team was expanded with friends of the brothers after pitching the idea to them. Tom Cannon credits Maxis' Sim games and Dwarf Fortress as inspiration for the city-building mechanics, while the class system was inspired by Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. On June 3, 2015, the game was released on Steam Early Access. Development on the game ended in 2018 with several promised features from the Kickstarter left unimplemented., even though the game Kickstarter surpassed the original goal.  Reception  Reviewing the early access build of the game, Brendan Caldwell from Rock, Paper, Shotgun criticized the pacing, saying that the ‚Äúbuild, defend, grow‚Äù cycle of the game distracts from the creative side of the game. Caldwell also critiqued the limitations on what to make in the game beyond houses and garrisons. Paul Tamburro from Game Revolution raised the issue of repetitiveness in the game, also criticizing the pace by calling it lackadaisical. Lena LeRey, writing at Indiegames.com, acknowledged that the early access release was buggy, but still full of promise. At PC Gamer, Christoper Livingston said that he found himself engrossed in the town building elements of the alpha build, but said that he would \\"probably wait for the beta before [getting] too invested\\".

Life Born and raised outside Memphis, Tennessee, she married E. Eveleth Winslow, an officer in the Army Corps of Engineers who had been the number one graduate in the class of 1889 at West Point. He designed and superintended construction of the fortifications at Fort DeRussy in Hawaii and along the Panama Canal. They had two children: Williamson Randolph Winslow, born 1901, and Mary Winslow, born 1903. Eveleth Winslow retired with the rank of Brigadier General in 1922 and the couple moved back to her family home, Goodwinslow, near Raleigh. There, she began to write poetry, which was published in Harper's, The Century, Scribner's, and The Atlantic. In 1925, a selection of her poems, The Long Gallery, was published. The New York Times' reviewer assessed that the book \\"reveals a graceful but limited talent\\" and that her work suggested \\"an achieved maturity: in other words, she seems to have reached the highest plane possible for her talent.\\" After her husband died in 1928, Anne Goodwin Winslow stayed on at Goodwinslow, where she hosted visits from numerous writers, including Robert Penn Warren, Ford Maddox Ford, Vachel Lindsay, Eudora Welty, Richard Halliburton, Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, and John Crowe Ransom. Their son, Randolph, followed in his father's footsteps, attending West Point and becoming an officer in the Army Corps of Engineers. He married the artist Marcella Com√®s Winslow in 1934. Com√®s' letters to her mother-in-law were published in 1993 as Brushes With the Literary: Letters of a Washington Artist 1943-1959. In 1943, she published her first work of prose, a memoir of life at Goodwinslow titled The Dwelling Place. Her intention, she later said, was \\"to give something of the feeling of the life that has gone on about me in this place ... to throw a little light on one corner of the American scene.\\" Kirkus Reviews described it as \\"Full of incident, it leaves a feeling of peace, contentment and good living.\\". Two years later‚Äîand just one month after her son Randolph died of pneumonia while serving with the U. S. Army in Europe, she published her first work of fiction, A Winter in Geneva, which included one novelette and seven short stories. In reviewing the book, Albert Jay Nock called Winslow \\"the most exquisite of miniaturists.\\" Her first novel, Cloudy Trophies, published in 1946 was set in Washington, DC and took as its protagonist the wife of a Southern senator. Although he compared Winslow's writing to that of Edith Wharton, The New York Times' Orville Prescott concluded that the book \\"... promises much, but produces little. The beauty and the wisdom and the wit it offers would have been ever so much more effective if condensed into a short story or elaborated in an essay.\\". Her second novel, A Quiet Neighborhood (1947), was set in a Southern town in the late 19th century. Her best-received novel, The Springs, was published in early 1949. Prescott called it one of the ten best books of 1949, writing that, \\"Its combination of serene wisdom with exquisite craftsmanship gives it a unique distinction.\\" Before the end of the year, she published her last novel, It Was Like This, of which The New Yorker's reviewer wrote, \\"Mrs. Winslow can break a heart with less fuss and less talk than almost any other writer around.\\" She continued to publish verse and a few short stories in various magazines until 1958. She died at Goodwinslow on November 2, 1959. In a piece titled, \\"On the Death of an American Artist,\\" Jacques Barzun wrote, \\"The qualities of Anne Winslow's fiction are a great precision in observing and telling, a capacity to render the passage of empty time, an ease and economy in evoking character and scene that makes for brevity but is neither arrogant nor dry. Her prevailing mood is an exquisitely quiet sadness, born of the misdoings of providence and the sense of the past.\\" Works * The Long Gallery, 1925 * The Dwelling Place, 1943 * A Winter in Geneva and Other Stories, 1945 * Cloudy Trophies, 1946 * A Quiet Neighborhood, 1947 * The Springs, 1949 * It Was Like This, 1949  References  External links * Review of \\"The Dwelling Place\\" at The Neglected Books Page, retrieved 2017-05-13 * Review of \\"The Springs\\" at The Neglected Books Page, retrieved 2017-05-13 * Review of \\"It Was Like This\\" at The Neglected Books Page, retrieved 2017-05-13 Category:1875 births Category:1959 deaths Category:20th-century American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:20th-century American short story writers Category:American women short story writers Category:Novelists from Tennessee Category:20th-century American women writers ","title":"Anne Goodwin Winslow"},{"id":"54029970","text":"Hedayat-Allah Khan () was a Gilaki prince, who was the semi-independent ruler of Gilan from 1753 to 1782. Background Hedayat-Allah was the son of Agha Jamal Fumani, a tribal chieftain from Fuman who was descended from the Dubbaj clan, which ruled Gilan in the late 15th-early 16th century, and claimed descent from the pre-Islamic Sasanian Empire and the biblical prophet Isaac. In 1749, two years after the death of the Iranian emperor Nader Shah (r. 1736‚Äì1747), Agha Jamal Fumani, along with a certain Agha Safi, seized Gilan. During the war between the Zand dynasty and the Qajars, the Qajar chieftain of the Qoyunlu branch, Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, made Gilan submit to his rule and in 1752 married the daughter of Agha Jamal Fumani. The following year Agha Jamal Fumani was killed in Shaft by Agha Hady Shafti, who, with the aid of Mirza Zaki, who governed Gaskar, controlled the province. However, his rule was short-lived‚Äî4 months later, Agha Hady Shafti was seized and executed in an unexpected attack by Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, who appointed Hedayat-Allah as governor of Gilan.  Reign  Map of northern Iran. When the Zand ruler Karim Khan Zand (r. 1751‚Äì1779) was conquering Iran, he in 1760 had Hedayat-Allah replaced with a close associate of his. However, whilst Karim Khan was on an expedition in Azerbaijan, Hedayat-Allah returned to Gilan and re-established his rule in the province. Karim Khan then shortly had him apprehended and penalized him by demanding 12,000 tomans as payment. He then appointed his cousin Nazar Ali Khan as the governor of the province, but later altered his stratagem and in 1767 restored Hedayat-Allah as the ruler of Gilan under Zand suzerainty. Furthermore, he also arranged the marriage between Hedayat-Allah's sister and his son Abol-Fath Khan Zand. In 1782 Agha Mohammad Khan invaded Gilan, Hedayat-Allah had changed his allegiance to the Zand dynasty. Hedayat- Allah then sent two diplomats, Mirza Sadeq and Agha Sadeq Lahiji, to Agha Mohammad to make peace. As a precaution he went to Shirvan. The diplomats were unable to come to favorable terms with Agha Mohammad Khan, who raided Gilan's capital Rasht and seized its riches. Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, 19th-century portrait. Agha Mohammad Khan now had to focus on Gilan because Hedayat-Allah had returned to the province (allegedly with Russian help) since the Qajar invasion of the province in 1782. In Agha Mohammad Khan's eyes, the whole Caspian coast was under threat by Hedayat-Allah and the Russians. Agha Mohammad Khan and his men easily managed to enter Gilan. While he was marching towards Rasht, he was joined by a local ruler named Mehdi Beg Khalatbari and other people. Furthermore, the Russian consul in Gilan betrayed Hedayat-Allah by providing weapons to Agha Mohammad Khan. Hedayat-Allah once again tried to flee to Shirvan, but was captured by men sent by a local ruler named Agha Ali Shafti (or another local ruler according to some sources), who killed him to avenge the slaughter of his family a few years earlier. Gilan was now completely under Qajar rule. Besides the conquest of Gilan, the second most valuable thing for Agha Mohammad Khan was Hedayat-Allah's treasure.  Characteristics and policies  Gilan flourished under the rule of Hedayat- Allah, who encouraged foreign trade by tempting a substantial amount of Armenians, Russians, Jews, and Indians to Rasht. He preserved an elegant court in Rasht, funded by the silk industry and the sea commerce between Bandar-e Anzali and Astrakhan. Nonetheless, according to the Cambridge History of Iran, \\"he was treacherous and bloodthirsty, even by the standards of the age, and his eventual overthrow by Mohammad Hasan Khan's son and political heir, Agha Mohammad Khan, passed unmourned.\\"  References   Sources   Category:18th-century Iranian people Category:People from Gilan Province Category:Iranian Shia Muslims Category:1782 deaths Category:18th-century births Category:Zand governors of Gilan Category:Qajar governors of Gilan Category:18th-century monarchs in the Middle East ","title":"Hedayat-Allah Khan"},{"id":"54029987","text":"Carstensen is a patronymic surname.

She had a groundbreaking stunt aerobatics career, often performing as \\"Princess-Kick-a-Hole-in-the-Sky\\", and later opened her own flight school in Cornelius, Oregon.  Childhood  Stenzel was born in Milwaukie, Oregon, in 1910. She attended Ardenwald Elementary School, St. Agatha School, and Milwaukie High School. As a child, she remembered chasing after a hot-air balloon in an attempt to get a ride. She was the second-youngest of five sisters.  Pilot Training  A week before Stenzel turned seventeen, she learned that she could get a plane ride near the Swan Island Municipal Airport in Portland. She took a street car into Portland, then walked to a small airport \\"just south of Swan Island\\". As she neared the airport, she began to run, afraid that \\"they were either going to crack up or run out of gas before I could get there.\\" She loved her plane ride, and remarked to the pilot, \\"If I was a boy, I'd certainly learn to fly!\\" The pilot encouraged her to sign up for lessons, but the cost was prohibitively high. To start flying lessons, which cost 25 dollars an hour (equivalent to $ today.), she would first have to pass a 250-dollar flight school ground course. Stenzel learned that she could make 100 dollars by making a parachute jump, and asked Tex Rankin, head of the Rankin Flying School, if he would take her up. After he declined, she found another pilot to carry her at an airshow in Medford, Oregon. She was initially too frightened to jump and clung tightly to the wing of the plane. After circling the jump site four times, Stenzel fell at last. She believed the pilot had hit her hands with a fire extinguisher to get her loose. Though she had been terrified before the jump, Stenzel recalled decades later that she had loved drifting down to earth. However, when the incident was just two years behind her, she said that \\"I'll never do another one unless I have to.\\" When Rankin heard the story, he offered Stenzel four more parachuting jobs, which gave her enough money to enroll in the ground course. However, when she graduated from the class, she discovered Rankin's mixed opinion of female aviators. \\"He mentioned all the things the boys could do,\\" she said, \\"and then he looked at me sitting in the front row and said, 'Oh, and the girls can work in the office.'\\" Stenzel challenged him to ride alongside her and, in her words, \\"pick holes in my flying.\\" Rankin was impressed by her performance and began teaching her stunts. She took lessons on weekends and after working eight-hour shifts as inspector at a wool mill. According to Rankin, Stenzel spent her little remaining time \\"learning everything she could about airplanes, reading books, working on airplanes and motors\\". One of her fellow students was Robert Dent Hofer, whom she later married.  Stunt Pilot Career  = Early Performances = Stenzel became a popular feature in Rankin's weekly air shows. Despite her newfound celebrity, she was shy in front of large crowds, and tried to avoid them. \\"I'd get way down low and work in about their knees, [ending] up behind the crowd,\\" she remembered. Despite Stenzel's discomfort with crowds, she performed in front of 25,000 people at the 1930 Portland Rose Festival. Stenzel was one of three female pilots in the show: the others were Mary Riddle and Edith Foltz. During the same show, Tex Rankin unsuccessfully tried to fly an upside-down figure eight, a feat which Stenzel would achieve later that year. = 1930: Northwest Tour and First Outside Loop = On June 22, 1930, Stenzel became the first woman to complete an upside-down outside spin. After two failures, she took a two-hour break, then returned to the air and finished the stunt correctly. One week later, on June 29, Stenzel became the first woman to complete an outside loop. At sunset, with 3,000 spectators watching her, she flew to an elevation of 6,000 feet. After three failed attempts, she made five successful outside loops. On her third, she dove \\"upside down for 3,000 feet\\" at nearly 200 miles per hour. After Stenzel's fourth loop, Rankin claimed that \\"if she tries to better that one, she will have to do some flying.\\" Right after this declaration, Stenzel did yet another outside loop. On July 29, Stenzel joined a fleet of fifty airplanes and embarked on a tour of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Edith Foltz seems to have been the only other female pilot on the tour. Over less than two weeks, Stenzel performed stunts in twenty-two cities, flying a yellow and red Great Lakes biplane with a 90 horsepower motor. Her sister, Helen Hester, traveled with her. In Springfield, Oregon, she performed outside loops, barrel rolls, \\"elephant rolls\\", and \\"almost every other kind of an aerial manuever\\" in front of 6,000 onlookers. The Eugene Register claimed that after this performance, local security \\"had great difficulty in keeping the spectators from crowding forward and fully crushing her and her small machine.\\" The tour concluded on August 7. After returning to Portland, Stenzel broke another record on September 21, when she became the first woman to complete an upside-down spiral and an upside-down figure eight. On her first two attempts at the figure eight, her motor stalled before she could complete her second loop. The third try, however, was a success. Over the course of 1930, Stenzel performed in front of half a million people. On November 29, the Women's International Association of Aeronautics awarded her a bracelet bearing their emblem. The bracelet was given to her by Grace Hay Drummond-Hay, the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a zeppelin. Stenzel belonged to Portland's chapter of the National Women's Aeronautic Association, which was led by Edna Christofferson and included noted pilot Edith Foltz. = 1931: Outside Loop Record = Stenzel practiced her flying daily over the winter, and in February, traveled to California. On February 22, she set the new women's record for outside loops, completing five in a row over the Grand Central Airport in Glendale. On the same trip, Rankin completed 72 consecutive outside loops in 88 minutes. In March, Stenzel set a new record, increasing to 23 consecutive outside loops at a benefit show for the Red Cross. By May, Stenzel had developed several new maneuvers, including the \\"Hester roll\\", created by accident. The Oregonian's aviation editor, Webster A. Jones, described it: \\"She places the plane in a vertical bank to the left, reverses suddenly into position, completes half of a snap roll to the right, and flies away upside down. In the air it looks like a question mark.\\" By this time, Stenzel could also complete \\"an outside loop, upside down spin, upside down figure eight, vertical rolls, double barrel rolls, slow aileron rolls, perpendicular whip stalls, 1 1/2 snap rolls, a 1 1/2 snap roll upside down, an upside down barrel roll, and several others.\\" In total, she could do 31 different stunts. In May, Stenzel performed in the first annual Omaha Air Show in Nebraska. She set yet another record by flying 69 consecutive outside loops, 62 of which were deemed perfectly rounded by observers from the National Aeronautic Association (NAA).Cooper, Stars of the Sky, Legends All, p. 101-102 and \\"Daredevil Flier Dorothy Stenzel,\\" Seattle Times, March 13, 1991. http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910313&slug;=1271486 This record would remain unbroken by any woman for 57 years.\\"Sky Princess Passes on Her Scepter, Sports Illustrated Dec. 18, 1989 https://www.si.com/vault/1989/12/18/121278/sky-princess-passes-on-her-scepter She had wanted to break Rankin's 72-loop record, but ran out of fuel before she could reach it. Stenzel was laughing when she landed and refused the ambulance that had been called for her. Instead, she walked away for a 90-minute nap, then returned to perform more stunts. Stenzel made 56 inverted snap rolls in a row, setting a new world record for both men and women. Noted aviator Al Williams said of her performance: > \\"There's a mere slip of a girl doing stunts that chiefs of the army and navy > air units of the nation said could not be done a year ago and the maneuvers > the greatest fliers in the world would not have attempted three years ago- > and she is not doing it in a $30,000 military plane with a powerful motor, > but she is doing it in a light, cheap airplane with a four-cylinder engine > at only 90 horsepower.\\" Stenzel and Rankin flew to Cleveland, Ohio to receive a plane from the Great Lakes Aircraft Company. It was presented to her by Robert Hofer and the B.F. Goodrich Company. The plane was designed specifically for Stenzel and meant to be flown upside down \\"with the same ease as in a normal position of flight.\\" Described as \\"trim, light-brown and crimson with crimson wings\\", it had a 90 horsepower motor and weighed less than 1,000 pounds. After the ceremony, Rankin, Stenzel, and Hofer flew back west together. Upon her return, she attended a reception in her honor, which was organized by the National Women's Aeronautic Association and drew 1,000 guests. Stenzel was a key performer in the 1931 Portland Rose Festival on June 12. Before an audience of over 20,000 people, she did eleven stunts, including six never before completed by a female pilot. After her performance in the Omaha Air Show, Stenzel was invited to the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio. She was the first woman to perform stunts at a national air show and the only pilot, male or female, to perform every day of the show. During each performance, she flew for 15 to 30 minutes. Also taking part in the races was Robert Hofer, Stenzel's former classmate. Stenzel's act was sponsored by the B.F. Goodrich Company. The races began on August 29th. Stenzel hoped to break the men's record of 125 consecutive outside loops on Labor Day, but was unsuccessful. The Tennessean described a positive reaction to her flights: > \\"She had the women at the races ga-ga every afternoon. She was the only > woman stunt artist on the bill, and after watching men pilots go nuts with > airplanes in the clouds for a couple of hours the women in the stands nearly > applauded their heads off when Dorothy would put on her show.\\" In an interview after she landed, Stenzel explained her passion for flying. \\"Why do I love it- this risking my life? Because up there it's so free. Just think, in the sky nobody can tell you what to do. With a good plane there isn't anything you can't do.\\" = 1932: Flight Instructor = Stenzel received her transport pilot's license in 1932. In April, Stenzel flew in the New Orleans Carnival of the Air. Later that month, she performed in an air show to raise money for the Goodfellow employment bureau in Shreveport, Louisiana. Stenzel became a flight instructor for the Union Avenue Flying Service, a flying school \\"and air taxi service\\" organized by Tex Rankin and his brothers Dudley and Richard. Just one month after the flying service was announced in The Oregonian, Dudley Rankin died from injuries sustained while working on his plane. On October 10, Rankin Field was dedicated in his honor: Stenzel and Tex Rankin both performed stunts at the ceremony. Also in 1932, Stenzel founded her own flight school, which she operated for the next two years.  Marriage to Robert Hofer  Stenzel married Robert Dent Hofer on June 30, 1934. The couple had two daughters, Sabine and Dorothy. Stenzel quit flight instruction and stunt flying when she married. In 1981, she recalled that \\"I had watched other women try to carry on a business and be married, too, and decided that I wasn't smart enough to be a good wife and keep up that kind of flying.\\" The couple frequently traveled by plane, and had their own airstrip outside their home in Banks, Oregon.  Gravity Testing  Stenzel was the first woman to undergo the U.S. Navy's gravity test for pilots. Although 6 G's of force was considered \\"rough\\", Stenzel was able to endure 8.6 G's.  Joann Osterud  In 1984, Stenzel was guest of honor at the Creswell Air Fair in Creswell, Oregon. There, she saw stunt pilot Joann Osterud fly, and asked her when she was going to try breaking Stenzel's outside loop record. On July 13, 1989, Osterud completed 206 consecutive loops at the North Bend, Oregon, Air Show, also beating the men's record of 180 loops. Stenzel came to the show to watch. She said that \\"I've had my day, and I think it's time for someone to have theirs.\\"  Later Life  Stenzel flew less often in her later years, lamenting the stricter regulations on air travel and \\"preferring to spend time with her five grandchildren\\". She remarried to Franklin H. Stenzel, and spent her retirement in a house near Banks, Oregon. She died of lung cancer on February 25, 1991, in a hospital in Bend, Oregon.  Recognition  There is an archival collection about Stenzel at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

It consisted of 22 episodes, airing on Fridays, having premiered on October 6, 2017. This season marked a significant change for the series, as it was announced at the end of the sixth season that the majority of the main cast members would not be returning in such capacity for season 7. Lana Parrilla, Colin O'Donoghue and Robert Carlyle were the only ones remaining, while Rebecca Mader and Jared S. Gilmore returned in recurring capacities. Andrew J. West and Alison Fernandez were announced as new regulars in May 2017. Dania Ramirez and Gabrielle Anwar were announced as additional regulars in July 2017. In August 2017, it was announced that Mekia Cox had been promoted to series regular after initially joining the cast in July as recurring. The storyline was softly rebooted with a main narrative led by an adult Henry Mills, set several years after last season's events. In February 2018, it was announced the seventh season would serve as the final season of the series; the season and series concluded on May 18, 2018. Existing fictional characters introduced to the series during the season include Tiana, Mother Gothel, Eudora, Dr. Facilier, Prince Naveen, Madame Leota, and Captain Ahab. The season also included new iterations of various characters previously appeared in earlier seasons such as Cinderella, Lady Tremaine, Drizella, Anastasia, Rapunzel, Jack, Hansel, Gretel, the Blind Witch, as well as Alice, who previously appeared in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. Premise Several years after the Final Battle, Henry Mills leaves Storybrooke in search of his own story, only to find himself in the New Enchanted Forest, where a conflict among its inhabitants culminates in the casting of a new curse that sends the New Enchanted Forest inhabitants to a Seattle neighborhood - in the past, before Henry left Storybrooke. As Henry's daughter Lucy sets out to restore his belief, Mother Gothel seeks to reclaim her former home by using her Coven of the Eight while avoiding Dr. Facilier and a vengeful witch hunter. The breaking of the curse leads to the arrival of the Wish Realm version of Rumplestiltskin, who seeks to destroy everyone‚Äôs happiness. His defeat eventually led Regina to recast the Dark Curse one last time, which merges all the realms of story into one: the United Realms.

After much speculation, executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis later confirmed that certain characters would have their storylines wrapped up and that the back-end of the sixth season had been written with the season 7 narrative change in mind. Despite the major changes from seasons past, the showrunners have said that they do not view season 7 as a complete reboot of the show. Horowitz said: \\"I hesitate to use the word 'reboot.' We're more thinking about it as a hybrid of a lot of things. We're paying homage to the original premise, but there are certain characters who are returning and some who are not. It's a combination of a lot of things, but what we're trying to do is go in a new direction but stay true to the spirit of what the show has always been.\\" In July 2017, the creators announced that the series now take place in the Seattle neighborhood of Hyperion Heights, which was created under a new and darker curse. Residents of this neighborhood include displaced characters from the original and new versions of the Enchanted Forest, as well as regular people from the Land Without Magic. This differs from Storybrooke in season 1, which was an isolated town that was blocked off from real-world Maine. The initial villain is Lady Tremaine, who assumes the role of an urban developer who seeks to \\"gentrify the neighborhood\\" and push out and separate fairy tale residents. Meanwhile, Storybrooke and various Fairy Tale Land locations still appear in the flashbacks of the season as the story bounces back and forth between the characters' lives before and during the latest curse. The main flashback setting of the seventh season is the New Enchanted Forest, which is a New Fairy Tale Land realm. Other locations featured in flashbacks are the Edge of Realms, the Wish Realm, Wonderland, Oz, and Storybrooke itself. =Casting= In May 2017, it was announced that Lana Parrilla, Colin O'Donoghue, and Robert Carlyle would be the only series regulars from season 6 to continue onto season 7. It was teased that the three would be portraying their original characters but with cursed identities, similar to the circumstances in season 1. In July, the first promo of the season revealed that Killian is now a Seattle police officer with the last name Rogers, who is living with an unexplained sense of loss. In August, it was revealed that Regina is now a bar owner named Roni, who is more dressed down and is \\"no longer in charge.\\" Former main cast member Jennifer Morrison has confirmed that she has agreed to return for one episode, later revealed to be the second episode of the season.

The complex encompasses a home, a museum on the top floor of a barn, and contributing objects. Originally owned by the sister and brother-in-law of the outlaw Dalton Gang brothers, local folklore says the brothers took refuge from the law in their sister's home. Restoration of the property was done in 1941 by the Works Progress Administration and the National Youth Administration. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 7, 2015. Original owners Eva Dalton, sister of the Dalton Gang brothers, married John N. Whipple on October 25, 1887 in Meade, Kansas. Whipple was the owner of a general store that bore his name. He sold groceries, clothing and a variety of general mercantile items. Whipple paid $400 for the house and property, which he lost to a Sheriff's sale on November 19, 1892. The new occupants of the house were H. G. Marshall and family. They discovered a small hidden tunnel that led from a closet door beneath the house stairwell, through the basement and to the barn. The Marshall daughter Mrs. Roy Talbott recalled incidents of strangers entering their home through the stairwell closet, after having left their horses in the barn. Entrance to the tunnel was sealed off and plastered over. Legend The Dalton brothers were a gang of 19th century robbers who stole from banks and trains. Historian Richard White has made the case that the Daltons were \\"social bandits\\"; that is, outlaws enabled by supporters who either actively helped them evade capture, kept silent about what they knew, or otherwise abetted the criminals. Such social bandits, White wrote, lived openly in communities who accepted them as friends and neighbors. The property being named as the hideout of Eva's outlaw brothers stems from a local legend that arose in the 20th century, claiming the brothers used it as a place of refuge. The brothers were known to have been in Meade in the years prior to their crime spree that began in 1890. No supporting documentation of their presence in Meade after that date has thus far surfaced. One of the earliest mentions of the legend came from the Wayne Settle family who owned the home in the 1930s, and supposedly had no prior knowledge of the walled-off tunnel. They recounted a visit from a stranger who claimed to have been part of the Dalton Gang, and was able to direct them to the tunnel's entrance. When the property was being developed into a tourist attraction in 1940, two individuals provided oral accounts that added to the lore. Local newspaper publisher Frank Fuhr claimed that he had used a telescope to watch the gang members enter, but never exit, the barn. Belle Mackey gave an interview to the local newspaper alleging that she and her husband unknowingly had Emmett Dalton as their ranch guest for two days in 1892, without asking his name or any other details. She claimed it was only after seeing Dalton's picture in a newspaper over a year later, that she believed he had been their visitor. Restoration and new construction The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government jobs creation program during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that included historic preservation, programs in the arts, and building or improving infrastructure such as parks. The National Youth Administration (NYA) came under the aegis of the WPA and was a jobs creation program for young men and women between the ages of 16 and 25. Kansas: a Guide to the Sunflower State, published in 1939 by the Federal Writer's Project of the WPA, listed the population of Meade as 1,552, and describes the town as, \\"... spreads out pleasantly on the prairie. It differs from most western Kansas towns in that it has many trees, shrubs and green lawns, made possible by an abundant supply of artesian water.\\" The Dalton Gang museum and park, composed of the Whipple property, was opened to the public in July 1940, having been purchased by the Meade Chamber of Commerce. The WPA, NYA and Meade Chamber of Commerce worked together in 1941 to restore existing structures and add new construction, with the wood-frame Whipple Victorian cottage as a centerpiece. The original hinged front door, with its small porch and front stoop remains intact but is no longer used as the entrance. Visitors must first enter the barn to access the 4-room house through the tunnel. The 2-story barn with its secret tunnel was reconstructed by the WPA in 1941, with the second floor housing the museum that had been originally operated out of the Whipple home by Ruth and Walter Dingess. Although the barn has a wooden shingle roof and a wood frame on both floors, and metal bars on the ground- floor windows, the foundation is of concrete. Gypsum was hauled in from Clark County to construct the basement walls. The 96-foot tunnel is only 32 inches wide and 80 inches high, and was constructed by both the WPA and NYA, also in 1941. Additional objects contributing to the NRHP listing that were built in 1941, are the wishing well, outdoor stove and the stone wall around the property. Later development NRHP listing Dad's Country Store was erected in 1951 and is considered a contributing property to the NRHP listing. A commemorative bell with a plaque honoring the contributions of Walter Dingle was installed in the yard in 1959. The Heritage House was donated and moved to the park in 1969. The property was listed on the NRHP in Meade County, Kansas on January 7, 2015.

Although based in Melbourne, the company has significant interests throughout Australia, with land holdings in Victoria and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. The business primarily bases its racing interests in Australia, however, races internationally with a particular focus on the New Zealand market in recent times. History ‚ÄòBarree Stud‚Äô, set over some 400 acres and located in Willowmavin in north eastern Victoria originally served as the breeding, spelling and pre-training centre for the company when it was first purchased. As the company has developed, Barree has been redeveloped into a pre-training, spelling and rehabilitation centre. During this process, the company's breeding operations have moved elsewhere, relocating to the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, where other major Australian and international breeding operations are primarily based. Facilities include a 2000 m sand-based track for workouts, equine water walker and swimming pool, high-speed treadmill, hyperbaric chamber and hydrotherapy equipment. In the early days of Ultra Thoroughbreds, the company focused on the purchase of quality race mares, as well as quality mares already at stud for breeding, rather than solely purchasing yearling fillies with the view of retirement to stud in the future. This has included the purchase of stock throughout the world, notably from South Africa and New Zealand, as well as domestically in Australia. Over the years, Ultra Thoroughbreds has diversified, now purchasing stock at all stages of development, including a recent focus on ‚Äòtwo year old in training‚Äô sales both here and abroad. This is in addition to the company's interest in purchasing weanlings, yearlings, tried horses and broodmares, depending on the need at the time and the market conditions. Ultra Thoroughbreds is also an active participant in the sale of these groups of horses. They have had broad success with a variety of winning thoroughbred horses throughout Australia, as well as success in South Africa, New Zealand and at Royal Ascot in the United Kingdom. In 2014, Ultra Thoroughbreds moved its entire breeding operation to the NSW Hunter Valley, where it purchased Golden Grove Stud (Denman) with G&C; Pastoral Company owner Vivian Oldfield. Although early in the history of this new venture, the stud has found success quickly and is proving to have an outstanding runner to winners strike rate at the racecourse. With the growth of the breeding operation, Golden Grove Stud has expanded in the 2016 season to nearby Riverslea Farm, with views to develop this into a centre of excellence for the stud's young produce. Recent stakes winning graduates of note include The Barrister (Listed Fernhill Handicap, Royal Randwick), Captain Duffy (Listed Geelong Classic, Geelong), Crown Witness (G3 Quezette Stakes, Caulfield) and the exciting Nature Strip (Inglis Dash, Flemington). In August 2020 Senior Trainer Danny O Brien won the Fred Hoysted Medal for Victorian trainers after a superb year in which he trained 100 winners for the season at a strike rate of more than 17 per cent. Group 1 winners Shamus Award ‚Äì 2013/14 Timeform Champion Australia 3yo and the highest, most successful and best credentialed son of Snitzel. He is the first horse in history to win the Group 1 VRC Australian Guineas after winning the Group 1 W.S. Cox Plate at Moonee Valley Racecourse. A multiple group performer at two years old, running an exceptional third in the Caulfield Guineas, this exceptional colt raced only in stakes company for the entirety of his career. Miss Andretti ‚Äì Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year in 2007 and is the only thoroughbred in racing history to simultaneously hold a total of five track records in Australia and England.

On 5 September 2015 the entire son of Casino Prince won the Group 2 Tramway Stakes, again at Royal Randwick (beating the likes of Lucia Valentina). He returned to racing on 15 April 2017 after injury to win the Group 3 Victoria Handicap at Caulfield Racecourse. Special note has been given to the resilience that Hooked has demonstrated, performing at the top level of racing from his two year old career, continuing as a rising seven year old in 2017 with this being a particular focus in the Australian racing industry, where a lot of credence is given to the \\"colonial bred\\" thoroughbred and its hardiness. Group 3 winners Addictive Nature (Savabeel x Generous Nature 2014) was acquired by Ultra Thoroughbred Racing at the New Zealand Bloodstock Premier Yearling Sale in January 2016. He was purchased for $775,000 NZD and registered a class-record at Warwick Farm in his first start as a two-year-old, breaking a 13-year-old record, set by champion thoroughbred Eremein. The full brother to stakes horse Savvy Nature, the colt ran second at his next start at Royal Randwick, before registering his first stakes win as a 3 year old in the G3 Ming Dynasty over 1400m at Royal Randwick. The colt has subsequently placed in the G2 Stan Fox Stakes (third) and G2 WFA Expressway Stakes (third). As of 2018, Addictive Nature is one of the outstanding three-year-old prospects of his generation, with a future at stud beckoning if he can fulfill the high expectations placed on the colt over the remainder of his three-year-old season.

Tata Communications was a founding partner of NJFX. NJFX opened a meet-me room (MMR) within Tata Communication's Wall, NJ subsea cable landing station (CLS). One of Tata's cables terminating in the cable landing station is the Seabras-1 undersea cable, which links North America and Brazil, with a landing point in Sao Paulo. Tata's TGN Atlantic subsea cable also lands in Wall Township, connecting to Highbridge, Somerset, United Kingdom. As the MMR operator, NJFX managed the network connections between its own customers and those of Tata Communication's CLS. In September 2015, NJFX announced they would be constructing a 64,000 sq ft Tier III data center adjacent to Tata's CLS, providing direct access to their European and South America subsea cables. Design would be done by Boston-based Bala Consulting Engineers. In January 2016, voice and data network provider Windstream announced it was extending its 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100G) network from NJFX's presence at the CLS to Ashburn, Virginia's Internet hub. In September, the new data center came online. In March 2017, NJFX announced they were adding an additional data center on their campus. Services NJFX operates a data center campus in Wall Township, NJ, offering meet-me room, data center and colocation services to business customers. The center is adjacent to a substation operated by Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L;), a subsidiary of energy giant FirstEnergy.

The Central Valley has been sinking at differing rates since the 1920s and is estimated to have sunk up to 28 feet. During drought years, the valley is prone to accelerated subsidence. California periodically experiences droughts of varying lengths and severity. The Central Valley is an agriculturally productive region dependent on large volumes of irrigation water. This region is considered arid to semiarid and is reliant on infrastructure to deliver water. The Central Valley is prone to excessive flooding due to snowmelt from the surrounding Sierra Nevada mountain range in the spring. A controlled system of dams and canals have been built by state and federal agencies to ensure a steady flow of water into the valley primarily to support agriculture. The California State Water Project and the Central Valley Project are the two main projects diverting surface water into the valley. This system helps prevent spring flooding and summer and fall water shortages. Farmers use a combination of surface water and groundwater for irrigation. During drought years there is less surface water being provided to farmers and they rely on pumping more groundwater. In California, there is a hierarchy of water entitlement in which those with water rights have precedence to receive and use surface water. Farmers without water rights may not always receive surface water during drought years. Farmers not receiving surface water may choose to rely on groundwater for irrigation. Drought years accelerate land subsidence in the Central Valley due to a collective effort of increased groundwater pumping without replenishing underground aquifers.  Groundwater pumping  Groundwater in the Central Valley is primarily used for irrigation needs in the agriculture industry and is retrieved using wells. During drought years, groundwater pumping is increased due a shortage of surface water available to farmers. Land subsides most rapidly during drought years due to the increased pumping and lack of sufficient groundwater recharge. Aquifers are not sufficiently recharged due to decreased rainfall and over-utilization of surface water. As groundwater is pumped, the aquifers are depleted and the water table drops. As the water table falls, competition may occur between farmers to drill deeper underground in order to avoid their well going dry. Agricultural wells may extend as far as 2,000 feet below ground.  Mitigation  Drought years increase the utilization of groundwater which creates a large demand for well drilling businesses. During peak demand, the cost of drilling inflates and clients may be put on waiting lists for lengths of time which exceed growing seasons. There are various irrigation techniques which can reduce water waste and prevent excessive groundwater use. For example, almond orchards require large volumes of water, but due to an increased use of drip tape farmers have dramatically reduced water waste. Using water more effectively saves money and mitigates unnecessary subsidence. Madera Irrigation District reported that they were able to restore of water in 2017 to aquifers by releasing unused irrigation water onto flood land available to them. They reported that some growers also released excess water allotted to them on flood lands to help restore aquifers. This practice mitigates overutilization of surface water. Governor Jerry Brown of California also imposed restrictions on unnecessary water usage during the California drought that began in 2012. Measures included drought-tolerant landscaping, rebate programs for purchasing water efficient appliances, and setting a statewide goal of 25% reduction in water usage. Brown also signed a bill allowing for $500 fines to residents who used water unnecessarily during declared drought emergencies. Unnecessary use includes watering sidewalks and exceeding use limits set by urban water suppliers.  Monitoring  Land subsidence in the Central Valley is monitored by various government agencies including NASA, the California Department of Water Resources, the USGS, and various local agencies or businesses within the valley. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses InSAR to remotely measure topographic change over time. In a monitoring study from May 2015 to September 2016, NASA found areas that were subsiding as rapidly as two feet per year. The data also revealed that southern El Nido and Corcoran, California were experiencing the most rapid sinking in a bowl shaped manner. In the Sacramento Valley, the DWR reports using GPS surveys to study elevation changes in a study known as the Sacramento Valley Height-Modernization Project. Their study includes 339 survey monuments throughout the valley. The DWR also has eleven borehole extensometers to collect detailed information at designated sites. The GPS survey gives a broad picture of change, and the borehole extensometers can focus on key areas. The USGS collects and synthesizes data from other agencies to make reports on land subsidence in the valley. They use InSAR data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in conjunction with interferograms to interpret the topographic change captured by satellite imagery. Continuous Global Positioning Survey station data from UNAVCO, Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center, Caltrans, and others are obtained for topography changes over a large region. Spirit Leveling data from the DWR, Delta-Mendota Water Authority, the Central California Irrigation District, and others are used to measure elevation change in a smaller area. The USGS uses the data from borehole extensometers provided by the DWR, and also utilizes information from piezometers to track changes in groundwater. Key components of studying land subsidence in the Central Valley include large and small scale monitoring, studying topography in relation to groundwater, and a multi-agency approach. Discoveries made by monitoring may allow for better mitigation practices and policies to prevent subsidence.  Infrastructure damage  Infrastructure damage caused by accelerated land subsidence threatens the effectiveness of many dams and canals sourcing surface water to the central valley. Damage has been noted in the California Aqueduct system and is attributed to the rate at which the valley floor is settling. Building foundations, pipelines, and other infrastructure may be at risk of damage as well. Areas with substantial subsidence may be at higher risk of flooding.

The band consists of Melvins' Buzz Osborne (guitar) and Dale Crover (drums), alongside Le Butcherettes' Teri Gender Bender (vocals) and Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez (bass) of At the Drive-In / The Mars Volta / Antemasque fame.  History  Osborne first saw Le Butcherettes open for his friend Jello Biafra. Excited by the performance, he told Crover that he wanted to tour with the band. Le Butcherettes opened for the Melvins on different occasions. The bands found common ground and their 2015 shows would typically end with Teri Gender Bender joining the Melvins onstage to perform covers of Pop-O-Pies' Fascists Eat Donuts and Bikini Kill's Rebel Girl. The latter song was eventually recorded in studio and released in September 2015 on Joyful Noise Recordings as a \\"Melvins feat. Teri Gender Bender\\" 7\\" single. As a result of their kinship, the Melvins and Gender Bender, along with the addition of Gender Bender's friend and frequent collaborator Omar Rodr√≠guez- L√≥pez, decided to form a separate band and record an entire album together. During one of the recording sessions, Su√°rez improvised the line \\"My name is Crystal Fairy!\\", likely as a reference to the 2013 Chilean film Crystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus. The name stuck with the band. Before that, the band was briefly called Red Alpha Royale (this name still appears on the labels of their debut 7\\" single \\"Necklace of Divorce\\"). Aftee performing several shows together, a booked tour was cancelled and the momentum of the band stopped entirely, with the band ‚Äúfalling apart‚Äù per Crover. ‚ÄúBuzz and I were really committed to it.

She has written on the history of eugenics in Eastern Europe, memory and war in twentieth-century Romania, gender and modernism, and gender and citizenship. She teaches history and gender studies at Indiana University, Bloomington, where she holds the John W. Hill Professorship. Between 2011 and 2014 she served as founding Associate Dean of the School of Global and International Studies and helped inaugurate the first SGIS graduating class in 2014.  Education and professional biography  After attending Georgetown University as an undergraduate in the School of Foreign Service (1987‚Äì91) and spending a year at the School for Slavonic and East European Studies in London (1989‚Äì90), she obtained graduate degrees (MA and PhD) in history from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (1996). There she worked under the guidance of Keith Hitchins and Sonya Michel. She has been working at Indiana University, Bloomington, since 1996, where she holds the John W. Hill Chair in East European History. Since 2016 she has also been a professor of Gender Studies. At Indiana University she served as Chair of Gender Studies (2008‚Äì09), Director of the Russian and East European Institute (2006-07 and 2009-11), Co-Director of the European Union Center for Excellence (2006‚Äì07), and founding Associate Dean of the School of Global and International Studies (2011‚Äì14). She has worked for several publications: Associate Editor of the American Historical Review (2003‚Äì06), Co-Editor for the Aspasia Yearbook of Gender and Women's History (2005‚Äì12), Board member for Gender and History, Journal of Women's History, Archiva Moldaviae, Cogent Arts and Humanities, and Integru.org. She has served as President of the Association for Women in Slavic Studies (2009‚Äì11), as Coordinator of the Gender and Women‚Äôs History Network for the European Social Science History Conference (2006‚Äì10), and as Chair of the Committee on Women Historians for the American Historical Association (2014‚Äì16). In addition, she has served on the General Council as well as the History Committee of the National Council for Accreditation of University Titles, Diplomas, and Certificates, Ministry of Education and Research, Romania (2016‚Äì18).  Research and publications  Bucur has published eight volumes, three of them as a single author, and the rest as co- author or editor. Her first monograph, Eugenics and Modernization in Interwar Romania (2002), examined the intellectual debates and policy-making activities of a group of doctors, lawyers, biologists, anthropologists, and politicians who used eugenicist ideas to propel Romanian society and institutions to a level of modernization in social engineering akin to attempts made in Germany and other West European states during the same period. Her second monograph, Heroes and Victims: Remembering War in Twentieth-Century Romania (2009), offered a close examination of various forms of remembering and commemorating the two world wars from 1918 onwards, with a focus on the tensions between grassroots and individual efforts (autobiographical writing, funerary monuments, commemorative plaques) and state-initiated commemorations (military cemeteries, official remembrance day commemorations, films). With a focus on the different meanings embodied in these various efforts, Bucur illuminates the important role played by such contestations in shaping the meaning of heroism, patriotism, and self-sacrifice along gender, regional, and ethno- religious lines. More recently, she has published Gendering Modernism: A Historical Reappraisal of the Canon (2017), which asks readers to reconsider the revolutionary aspects of modernism from the perspective gender norms. In 2018 she is publishing two new books. The Century of Women: How Women Have Transformed the World Since 1900 is a bold overview of recent history from a feminist humanist perspective, placing women's historical empowerment at the heart of understanding recent changes in politics, economics, demography, culture, and knowledge making. Karen Offen, of Stanford University, calls it a book that \\"should find a place on every intelligent person's reading list.\\" Her newest monograph, co-authored with Mihaela Miroiu, Birth of Democratic Citizenship: Women in Modern Romania, will come out in November 2018 with Indiana University Press. In addition to these monographs and other co-edited volumes, she has published over seventy articles and chapters in a variety of outlets, from The American Historical Review to the Times Literary Supplement. She has had dozens of media appearances and interviews in the press, from the History Channel to Al-Jazeera.  Romanian studies  A passionate promoter of culture and history from her native country, Bucur has helped organize eleven conferences on Romanian Studies (2007-2017) at Indiana University. Together with her colleague Christina Zarifopol-Illias, she worked to establish the first Romanian Studies graduate fellowship in the United States at Indiana University. She has worked with various partners in Romania. At Babe»ô-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, together with a team of scholars from Indiana University and the Central European University, she helped launch the Oral History Center in 1997. She has worked with colleagues at the National School for Political Science and Public Administration in Bucharest on several research and publication projects, and also taught several graduate workshops. She has collaborated with Transylvania University in Bra»ôov and the Aspera foundation on two oral history workshops. In addition to these academic events, she has worked with artists and musicians to promote visibility for Romanian culture. Awards and honors Bucur is the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships, among them two National Endowments for the Humanities research grants, a research fellowship from the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, DC, and a fellowship from the American Association for University Women.

In the episode, after an Angel is killed, Sam, Dean and Castiel investigate and discover there's a hunter that's killing connected angels to the murder of her child and the father of the child. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the case of the week. Plot An angel named Benjamin (Miranda Edwards) is murdered, drawing the attention of a flight of angels he had been a part of including Ishim, Mirabel and Castiel (Misha Collins). Sam (Jared Padalecki), Dean (Jensen Ackles), and Castiel investigate the murder, only to have Mirabel killed as well by Lily Sunder, who flees when the Winchesters intervene. Castiel and Ishim explain that in 1901, Lily had married an angel named Akobel and had a Nephilim daughter. As this was against Heaven's laws, they killed Akobel and his daughter May; now Lily wants revenge. The Winchesters track down Lily and are shocked to learn that her daughter was human, not Nephilim. Lily had studied angels all of her life and her powers come from Enochian magic. Lily's studies had allowed her to summon Ishim, who taught her all the secrets of angels but became obsessed with her. Lily had married Akobel for protection and Ishim murdered Akobel and her daughter in revenge. Believing Lily's story, Dean heads off to confront Ishim, followed soon after by Lily and Sam. Dean and Castiel confront Ishim, who eventually confirms Lily's story and battles them. After Ishim defeats the humans, Castiel kills him to save Lily, who is unsure whether or not she will give up on revenge since it's all she's had for over a hundred years. Castiel apologizes for his role in the death of Akobel and May and offers that if she leaves and finds that she can't forgive him, he will be waiting for her to take her chance. Lily ultimately departs after thanking Castiel. Later, the Winchesters and Castiel discuss the troubling implications of Lucifer's child and Castiel breaking the deal with Billie. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.73 million viewers with a 0.6/2 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.72 million viewers with a 0.6/2 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 2 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the most watched program on The CW in the day, beating Riverdale. =Critical reviews= \\"Lily Sunder Has Some Regrets\\" received mostly positive reviews. Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.3 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"While 'Lily Sunder Has Some Regrets' had a shaky start, it was a case of the week that wound up having dramatic weight and touched on the larger issues the main characters are dealing with. It was a far more interesting and investing case than it initially let on, but thankfully, the hour finished strong.\\" Sara Netzley from EW gave the episode an \\"A\\" and wrote, \\"Whew. Whew. What a perfect blend of plot, action, callbacks to previous seasons, history-dependent emotional angst, and setup for episodes to come. (Think one of the brothers will try to master Enochian powers at the cost of his soul?) Kudos to Alicia Witt for creating a strong, tragic character in Lily, who I'd love to see turn up again.\\" Bridget LaMonica from Den of Geek gave the episode a perfect 5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"Supernatural brought us an episode rife with the theme of consequences. This is especially true in regards to angels making rash decisions regarding humanity. Also: a Kill Bill like assassin! What's not to love?\\" References Category:Supernatural (season 12) episodes Category:2017 American television episodes ","title":"Lily Sunder Has Some Regrets"},{"id":"54030645","text":"Orchestra National de Jazz is a French jazz ensemble originally created at the initiation of Jack Lang, at that time Minister of Culture.

She was director of the Margarita Rudomino All-Russia State Library for Foreign Literature from 1993 to 2015.\\"Ekaterina Genieva; Moscow librarian who helped Russians to access thousands of western books as the Soviet Union collapsed.\\" Times [London, England], 23 July 2015, p. 49. Genieva was born in Moscow. Her mother was a physician and she was raised by her grandmother. She studied English literature at Moscow State University and defended her dissertation in 1972 on James Joyce. It was the first dissertation in the Soviet Union on the author, who was widely banned in the country. She went on to write criticism and bibliographies of many authors, including Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, and the Bront√´s. She joined the Library for Foreign Literature in 1971 and spent the rest of her career there. The library held works in 140 languages and was a place where people could research subjects and authors that were otherwise banned or forbidden in Soviet Russia. She became deputy directory under Vyacheslav Ivanov in 1990. During the 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt, she allowed the Library's photocopiers (access to photocopiers were under close control in the Soviet Union) to be used to publish resistance newspapers. A government official investigated this and Genieva took responsibility. The official simply insisted that they draw the curtains to prevent the light of the photocopiers from being seen from the street. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, a British initiative called Book Aid which resulted in over one million books were donated to the country. Genieva coordinated the distribution of the books to libraries across the former Soviet Union. In response to concerns about what types of material to send, she said \\"Send it all! We've had enough of censorship!\\". Genieva also spearheaded efforts to identify and return over 40,000 books looted from European libraries by Soviet troops during World War II. She was president of the Russian Open Society Foundation from 1995 to 2004, which helped establish Internet access, provide textbooks, and fund libraries throughout the country. Among the many awards she received was the Order of the British Empire in 2007. She was also the first woman proposed for membership in the Athenaeum Club.  Personal life  Genieva married engineer Yury Belenky and they had a daughter, Darya. Genieva was a Russian Orthodox Christian. She was a supporter of Father Alexander Men and on the board of the Russian Bible Society.

Career Waitzman‚Äôs professional career began in 1959, when he made the first of several recordings with his teacher, Bernard Krainis, at the age of 15.Nagle, loc. cit. In 1962, he recorded a Frescobaldi Canzona with Krainis and lutenist Joseph Iodine on the Baroque one-keyed flute. This performance appeared on a recording entitled The Virtuoso Recorder.https://www.discogs.com/Bernard- Krainis-The-Virtuoso-Recorder/release/1621112. In 1965, Waitzman had a bell key (originally invented by Carl DolmetschDaniel Waitzman, ‚ÄúThe Bell Key,‚Äù The American Recorder, Vol. IX, No. 1, pp. 3-4.) fitted to his recorder; and he began to develop a new technique for playing the bell-keyed recorder.Daniel R. Waitzman, Up from Authenticity, or How I Learned to Love the Metal Flute‚ÄîA Personal Memoir, Amazon Kindle Book, 2012, loc. 324. He arranged three of J.S. Bach‚Äôs Organ Trio Sonatas for bell-keyed recorder and harpsichord, and also arranged J.S. Bach‚Äôs E Major Violin Concerto for bell-keyed recorder and strings. It was around this time that he became dissatisfied with the early music movement‚Äôs philosophical approach to the performance of the older repertoire, and also with the limitations of the one-keyed ‚ÄúBaroque‚Äù flute. Later, he published several critiques of the modern early music movement, including a book entitled Up from Authenticity, or How I Learned to Love the Metal Flute‚ÄîA Personal Memoir.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008G5X2A6.

The original essay on which this book was based served as the subject for a feature article in The New York Times in 1990.Donal Henahan, \\"Flexibility Can Be Authentic, Too,\\" The New York Times, Sunday, July 22, 1990, Arts and Leisure (Sec. 2), pp. 1 ff. In an article published in The American Recorder in 1980, Waitzman had called for a more flexible approach to the performance of early music: ‚ÄúMusical and historical authenticity are not always identical, nor are the disciplines of musicology and performance the same. If a musical repertoire is worth playing for its own sake‚Äîfor its musical truth, rather than merely for its historical significance or quaintness‚Äîthen it must of necessity be as modern today as when it was newly- composed. It transcends temporal considerations; it exists outside of time and place. . . . Let me emphasize that I am not advocating the abandonment of historically correct instruments. Rather, I am calling attention to the need for a more humanistic stance‚Äîone in keeping with the spirit of the old masters. Despite the dangers of such ideological relaxation, especially in an age such as this, there is really no other valid alternative. Either we are practitioners of a living art, or we are museum curators and morticians. I do not think that a mausoleum is an appropriate setting for our musical heritage. Only those who remain unmoved by this heritage could dare to advocate its embalmment in the formaldehyde of historical fundamentalism‚Äîand they do not deserve to be hailed as its guardians.‚ÄùDaniel Waitzman, ‚ÄúHistorical Versus Musical Authenticity: A Performer‚Äôs View,‚Äù The American Recorder, Vol. XXI, No. 1, May 1980, pp. 10-11. Also quoted in Geoffrey Burgess, Well-Tempered Woodwinds, Indiana University Press, 2015, p. 128. In 1971, Waitzman acquired an antique conical Boehm flute built ca. 1875 by Louis Lot.Good, p. 51. That same year, he made his formal d√©but in Carnegie Recital Hall as a winner of the Concert Artists Guild Award, at which he performed on recorder, Baroque flute, and conical Boehm flute.http://www.concertartists.org/competition- winners. Retrieved May 1, 2017. See also Nagle, loc. cit. Waitzman has taught flute and recorder at Queens College, CUNY, and at Hofstra University. In 1973-74, Waitzman persuaded the brothers Bickford and Robert Brannen to revive the manufacture of conical Boehm flutes. This project led to the establishment of the flute-making firm of Brannen Brothers.Brannen Brothers catalogue, 1974. By 1976 Waitzman became convinced that it was possible to play the modern flute in a manner consistent with the aesthetic requirements of the older repertoire, using a type of embouchure very close to that of Boehm, the original inventor of the modern flute.Good, p. 53; Waitzman, Up From Authenticity, loc. 456. He established himself as a performer on modern flute, and gave numerous recitals illustrating the history of the flute. Waitzman has toured the United States and Canada as soloist and chamber musician. In 1976, he performed several of Vivaldi‚Äôs Piccolo Recorder concerti with Amor Artis at Alice Tully Hall. The New York Times reviewer Raymond Ericson called his performance of the A Minor Concerto ‚Äúnothing short of miraculous.‚ÄùRaymond Ericson, ‚ÄúAmor Artis Presents Vivaldi With Verve,‚Äù The New York Times, December 23, 1976. He has served as soloist and chamber musician on flutes and recorders with The Long Island Baroque Ensemble since 1974, and performed several concerts with the Bach Aria Group, including a Telemann Concerto for Recorder and Flute (with his teacher, flutist Samuel Baron).Personal interview, May 3, 2017. In 1978, Waitzman published The Art of Playing the Recorder, a codification of the technique of both bell-keyed and keyless recorders.Daniel Waitzman, The Art of Playing the Recorder, New York, AMS Press, 1978. He had tried to convince recorder makers to offer a series of bell-keyed recorders expressly designed to take advantage of the bell key,Burgess, p. 79 and had suggested that they undertake the development of a modernized recorder;Daniel Waitzman, \\"A Plan to Promote the Development of a Modernized Recorder,\\" The American Recorder, Vol. XII, No. 3, August 1971, pp. 71-72. and their failure to do so caused him to turn more and more to the Boehm flute, in both their conically-and cylindrically-bored forms, as his primary instrument.Ibid., pp. x-xi. In 1980, he was awarded an International Bach Society Performance Award. In 1987, he received a National Endowment for the Arts Solo Recitalist Fellowship Grant to give a recital in New York‚Äôs Alice Tully Hall.Good, p. 49. After pondering the current state of contemporary music, and the history of music since the Enlightenment, Waitzman turned his attention to the composition of new music in 1992, in the belief that a revival of what he considered the aesthetic ideals and highly affective approach of the old masters was long overdue.Waitzman, Up from Authenticity, loc. 1161. He claimed that the current state of contemporary music reflected ‚Äúa deep-seated pathology that has afflicted Western music for well over a century‚Äîa bellwether as well as a cause of the decline of the West.‚ÄùIbid., loc. 1141 He asserted that if older styles could still move modern musicians and audiences, then they must, by definition, be acceptable for use as a basis for newly composed music: ‚ÄúSo much has been discovered that it may no longer be possible to discover fundamentally new ways of organizing sound without transgressing beyond the boundaries of musical affect, as dictated by the human psyche, the human ear, and the very laws of acoustics themselves‚Äîwhich boundaries are as narrow as the prerequisites for the survival of life itself. This fact‚Äîif indeed it be a fact‚Äîdemands a radically new approach to the concept of musical obsolescence. I believe that if a musical language remain powerful enough to move modern listeners, then it must by definition remain eligible for use in contemporary composition.‚ÄùIbid., loc. 1085 To believe otherwise, in his view, was to deny the what he called the almost purely Platonic nature of musical art, as well as to judge music according to extra- musical, and therefore spurious, criteria. He reasoned further that music must be governed by what he considered the limitations and characteristics inherent in the human psyche and in the overtone series, and that the objective materialistic criteria of science and technology, and of modern materialism in general, were essentially inapplicable to the theory and practice of music as an art. He espouses what he holds to be a more intuitive, subjective approach, more akin to the religious world view of the old masters than to the empirical objectivity of modern science and technology. At the same time, he rejects what he considers the relativistic stance of post-modernism that holds all beliefs to be both arbitrary and equally acceptable. Although some of his compositions fall under the rubric of ‚Äúmusical historicism,‚Äù in that they utilize older musical languages and could even be mistaken for works written hundreds of years ago, Waitzman believes that most of his output displays a willingness to go beyond the boundaries of purely historicist composition, through the integration, usually within a galant framework, of elements from a variety of styles, including seventeenth-century cross-relations and harmonic usages, and a world view that takes into account the post-Enlightenment experience, while at the same time attempting to preserve and integrate the fundamental aesthetic and spiritual precepts of the old masters.

It incorporates a multi-denominational sanctuary, other sacred spaces, and a number of burial grounds. The Cathedral, which commands a scenic view of forested land and Mount Monadnock, is run as a nonprofit corporation. History In 1937, Douglas Sloane III and his wife Sibyl purchased a property about northeast of the center of Rindge. Their intention was that their four children would later build houses on separate lots within the property. The following year, a destructive hurricane hit the region, and the five-acre lot selected for the second son, Sanderson (Sandy), was badly damaged. It was situated on a knoll and when the family went to assess the damage, they saw that the fallen trees had revealed a spectacular view across the forests towards Mount Monadnock to the northwest, with other mountains visible beyond. The view remains unspoiled to this day. Sandy, who joined the United States Army Air Forces, was killed in action in 1944, leaving a wife and newborn son (who would survive less than three years). In August 1945, the family used the clearing that would have been his home for a memorial service that was attended by people around the community. Building on that event, the Sloanes developed the Cathedral of the Pines as a memorial for those fallen in service to the nation, and as a monument to peace and understanding. They welcomed people of all faiths, and developed the site into a series of locations for outdoor chapels, cemeteries, and other monuments. It now encompasses . Cathedral of the Pines is a nonprofit corporation that accepts on-site donations and is supported by veterans organizations and other local service organizations. Features View from the main sanctuary, looking at Mount Monadnock Most of the features of the site are built of stone (principally granite), with the exception of some wooden benches. Many bronze panels are inset into the stone, commemorating individual deceased servicemen and servicewomen, and acknowledging sponsoring organizations. At the entrance to the complex are the Mother's Chapel and the Women's Memorial Bell Tower. A short walk leads to the main sanctuary. This includes the Altar of the Nations, which incorporates stones from every U.S. state and from several battlefields. The Altar has the most compelling view of Monadnock and has been designated as a national memorial to American war dead. The pews, lectern, pulpit, and stoup are also made entirely of stone. A winding path leads to cemetery plots, additional open-air chapels (including a sparse \\"Zen chapel\\"), a garden, and standing stones that carry carved inscriptions from the Bible and other spiritual texts. Some of the inscriptions are in Hebrew. Several longer trails lead through the woods and to the nearby Grassy Pond and Emerson Pond. The Peter J. Booras Museum holds service-related memorabilia. After a renovation, it was re-opened on 20 May 2017. Uses Cathedral of the Pines hosts weddings and marriage renewal ceremonies. It offers memorial services and burials, as well as personalized memorial benches, placards, and carved granite walls. The current organization describes the Sloanes' dream as a \\"cathedral without borders\\", and claims to have hosted events for 75 different faiths. Individuals can usually freely visit the grounds between May and October; private events, tours, and picnics are also available.

Three people, including the local police chief, were killed. The events began when Kirkersville Police Chief Steven Eric Disario responded to reports of an armed man, and was shot and killed during a shootout. The gunman, identified as 43-year-old Thomas Hartless, then entered a local nursing home and killed two people before committing suicide. Background Kirkersville is a village with a population of 525 at the 2010 census, located east of Columbus and characterized as quiet. Its police department is small, operates part-time, and consists of only three officers: Chief Steven Eric Disario, a second officer who was on military leave at the time of the shooting, and an auxiliary officer. The department relies on the Licking County Sheriff's Department when its officers are off-duty. Events At around 7:45 a.m., Chief Disario responded to a report about a man with a gun, later identified as Thomas Hartless. Arriving at the Pine Kirk Care Center, a local nursing home, Disario spotted Hartless in an alley behind the home, and issued a radio communication that he had spotted the gunman. According to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, before shooting Disario, Hartless had taken two people hostage over an hour before to conceal his presence. Hartless and Disario engaged in a shootout that left Disario fatally wounded, while the two hostages escaped unharmed. Disario was found by responding deputies who pulled him to safety. He later died at a hospital. After murdering Disario, Hartless entered the nursing home, which had 23 residents inside at the time, and killed two female workers. Police eventually found Hartless dead inside the building, having reportedly committed suicide. They evacuated the home of any residents hiding inside. The situation was declared under control by police by 10:00 a.m. The nearby Kirkersville Elementary School was put on lockdown as a precaution, with students en route being redirected to Watkins Middle School. =Victims= Steven Disario was the chief of the part-time Kirkersville Police Department for three weeks, having gotten the job after its previous chief stepped down. He was also a sales worker for a home modeling company, and a father of six with a baby on the way. The deceased nursing home employees were identified as Cindy Krantz, a 48-year-old nurse's aide, mother of five and grandmother of one. Marlina Medrano, the other victim, was a nurse. Perpetrator Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Hartless was a citizen of Utica and had a criminal record in Knox County, located north of Kirkersville; his convictions dated back to 1992. He completed a prison sentence for \\"domestic violence and criminal damaging/endangering charges.\\" Before that, Hartless spent fifteen months in prison for aggravated assault and aggravated menacing charges, after having initially been charged with kidnapping and felonious assault in 2009 for abducting a woman, reported to be an old girlfriend, in Newark and holding her captive in Coshocton County for hours before releasing her. According to authorities, Hartless had a relationship with Mendrano. It was reportedly an unhealthy one, and Medrano was listed as one of the people Hartless was forbidden to have contact with during two domestic violence cases between December 2016 and March 2017. Medrano had also obtained three civil protection orders from him, explaining that he was abusing her. The latest order was still active at the time of the shooting. Hartless had domestic violence convictions in 2016 and 2017. Reactions Governor John Kasich reacted to the shooting in a Twitter post, expressing the state's mourning of Disario and calling the event \\"horrific\\". He ordered flags to be flown at half-mast until May 16. Jay McDonald, president of the Ohio chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union in the U.S., said that the effects of Disario's murder were \\"felt across the state.\\" References Category:Deaths by firearm in Ohio Category:2017 in Ohio Category:2017 murders in the United States Category:Murder in Ohio Category:Crimes in Ohio Category:Attacks in the United States in 2017 Category:May 2017 crimes in the United States Category:Licking County, Ohio Category:Spree shootings in the United States ","title":"Kirkersville shooting"},{"id":"54030950","text":"Junius Ka ªae (September 17, 1845 ‚Äì December 19, 1906) was a Native Hawaiian politician of the Kingdom of Hawaii. In 1887, he was implicated in the infamous bribery scandal involving King KalƒÅkaua over the sale of an opium license to Tong Kee. Life and career Ka ªae served many positions during the Hawaiian monarchy. He worked as a notary public and agent of labor contract for the island of Kauai, receiving his first appointment in December 13, 1877 and a later reappointment on January 13, 1879. On April 29, 1882, he was appointed by King KalƒÅkaua as a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He served from 1882 to 1886 until the 1887 Bayonet Constitution removed all appointed nobles and made both legislative chambers elective. Around this time, he also served as Registrar of Conveyances from October 30, 1886 to July 13, 1887 and a member of the Hawaiian Board of Health on February 16, 1887. The latter was a brief governmental organization in charged of licensing kahuna or practitioners of traditional Hawaiian medicine. The Gynberg Duke and Kiyi, from the Gynberg Ballads, 1887 In the capacity of Registrar of Conveyance, Ka ªae was implicated in a corruption charge leveled on the king by his opponents. It was reported that Ka ªae had convinced a Chinese rice planter named Tong Kee, alias Aki, to make a bribe of $75,000 (of which only $71,000 was actually paid) to the king, in order to secure the grant of an opium sales license. It was rumored that the large sum of cash was smuggled into the palace in baskets and handed to Ka ªae. When the license was awarded to Chun Lung, another Chinese immigrant, Aki demanded the money back and when the money was not returned he outed the king and Ka ªae in twelve affidavits detailing the controversy. The opium bribery scandal was satirized in the political satirical pamphlet, the Gynberg Ballads published by Alatau T. Atkinson, editor of the Hawaiian Gazette, and possibly coauthored by Edward William Purvis, a former member of the king's military staff. Shipments of the ballads arrived from San Francisco on May 13, 1887 and was distributed widely despite attempts by the government to seize the printed pamphlets. One of the parts titled \\"The Opium Racket\\" summarized the scandal although changing the names of the participants. Aki became \\"You Lie\\", the king was transformed into the \\"Gynberg Duke\\" and Ka ªae became \\"Kiyi\\". This became one of the corruption charges which led to the coup of the king by the Reform Party and the signing of the 1887 Bayonet Constitution which restricted his executive power. Ka ªae was forced to resign. He was later appointed to the Privy Council of State, the advisory council for the monarch, on December 14, 1886 by King KalƒÅkaua, and continued in this role even after the opium license controversy. The king died in 1891 and was succeeded by his sister Lili ªuokalani. After her accession to the throne, the new queen reappointed Ka ªae to her Privy Council on March 7, 1891. Records of the Privy Council indicate that he only served one year before ceasing to sit in this body in 1892.; Personal life Son William F. Ka ªae He married three times. With his first wife Kukakina, he had a son named William F. Ka ªae (1870‚Äì1938), who became a county official for the Territory of Hawaii. His second wife was Kamehaokalani, a relative of Queen Kapi ªolani, and they had three children. His third wife Jessie Kapaihi Lane, sister of Honolulu Mayor John C. Lane, survived him. In later life, Ka ªae attempted to claim, on behalf of his deceased second wife, the lands of Keali ªiahonui, the son of the last independent king of Kauai Kaumuali ªi. His suit stating that the last will of Keali ªiahonui was forged was rejected by the courts. In 1893, almost immediately following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the Kaae petition was accepted and the probate of Keali ªiahonui was reversed by the provisional government as the first case heard by Dole after the overthrow. Ka ªae died of blood poisoning at Queen's Hospital in Honolulu. His funeral was held at the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace and he was buried at the Kawaiaha ªo Church cemetery.

It stars Aria Emory, who co-wrote the film with von Hoffmann, and Drew Harwood as brothers who become stranded in a town run by cannibals. It was released in October 2016 in Australia and February 2017 in the US. It has an approval rating of 44% at Rotten Tomatoes.  Plot  While on the road, seeking vengeance for the murder of their father, brothers Miles and Dominic rob a store. The owner shoots Miles in the hand before they kill him. Dominic improvises a bandage for Miles, and they rest for the night in the desert. When Miles expresses doubt in their mission, Dominic angrily threatens to leave him to die in the desert. The brothers continue on after reconciling. While asleep in their car, Miles is surprised by several armed men. After beating him, they announce that they intend to kill him and steal his car. Before they can, Dominic returns and kills all three despite Miles' pleas for the killing to end. Miles and Dominic arrive at a small town, where they encounter an old man walking down the street. The man initially refuses to speak to them, but he seems willing to help once they offer him food. After he surprises them by puncturing one of the car's tires with a knife, Dominic begins beating him. A young woman, Vijah, stops him at gunpoint and ushers the two into her house, where she performs first aid on Miles. Vijah explains that the town's leader, Doyle, is dangerous, and they should all stay inside her house for their safety; Dominic ignores her warnings. While exploring the ruins of the town, Dominic encounters Sasha, who seduces him. As they have sex, Sasha's boyfriend, Latos, appears. While Sasha holds Dominic at gunpoint, Latos grabs Miles and chastises Vijah for hiding the brothers from Doyle. Latos beats Dominic with a baseball bat but leaves the killing blow to Doyle. Latos forces Miles to watch as Doyle murders his brother. When Doyle later questions Miles in his office about why the brothers have trespassed in his territory, Miles refuses to cooperate, to Vijah's concern. Noticing this, Doyle and his gang taunt her. Doyle himself slashes one of her ears to teach her a lesson about loyalty. Latos delivers food to Miles and says they are interested in having Miles join their gang. Latos explains Dominic was too obviously strong-willed and independent to be of use to them. When Miles is again uncooperative, Latos taunts him with the insinuation that the food is his brother's flesh. Vijah later visits Miles, and gives him a shard of glass. The two caress each other wordlessly, and he observes her scarred ear. Doyle invites everyone to a dinner. Miles, finding Dominic's head on a platter, grows enraged as Doyle's gang noisily eats and taunts him. Miles draws the glass shard and stabs Sasha in the throat. Latos jumps on him and begins eating his face as Doyle impassively watches Sasha die. Vijah kills Latos, but another gang member takes her hostage. Doyle unceremoniously kills the gang member and takes Vijah hostage himself. Miles shoots Vijah in the gut; the bullet passes through her and kills both her and Doyle. After tenderly shutting her eyes, Miles points the gun at the old man encountered earlier, who has also been eating Dominic's flesh. As the man whimpers wordlessly, Miles lowers the gun and leaves.  Cast  * Aria Emory as Miles * Drew Harwood as Dominic * Monique Rosario as Vijah * Anthony Ficco as Latos * Rebecca Fraiser as Sasha * James McCabe as Doyle  Production  Director and co-writer Chris von Hoffmann said he channeled his anger and frustration into the film, intentionally making it as nihilistic and mean-spirited as possible. His primary influence was The Proposition, though U Turn influenced the initial concept when he was still brainstorming ideas. This early concept involved two brothers who entered a haunted town, but the supernatural aspect was later dropped. von Hoffmann described the film as a \\"hybrid exploitation thriller that is basically a love letter, a deconstruction of genre movies in general\\". Von Hoffmann and Aria Emory, the co-writer and star, met on the set of Behaving Badly and subsequently began developing Drifter. von Hoffmann said Emory was always intended to play the lead. The rest of the cast were not auditioned; instead, they came from people with whom von Hoffmann had previously worked or people with whom he wanted to work. Shooting took place in Southern California over the course of approximately 13 days.  Release  Drifter was released in Australia before its United States premiere. In Australia, Accent Film Entertainment released the film on DVD October 19, 2016. XLrator Media gave Drifter a limited theatrical release in the US on February 24, 2017, and a video on demand release four days later.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 44% of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.3/10. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Despite the relentless violent mayhem, Drifter somehow commits the cardinal grindhouse movie sin of being deadly dull.\\" Scheck described the film's plot as a \\"rip-off pretending to be homage\\". Matt Donato of Film Journal International called it \\"a cinematic collage assembled from better movies\\", criticizing the film for not having enough individuality to support the homages. In describing the film as \\"semi- successful\\", Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Sometimes it's impressively funky and stylish, and sometimes tediously derivative.\\" Murray concluded by praising the film's ambition and von Hoffmann's artistic voice. Writing for LA Weekly, Luke Y. Thompson called film's premise refreshing, as it recycles less-used aspects of the original Mad Max film. However, Thompson criticized the characters as unlikable, which he says makes their plight uninteresting. John Townsend of Starburst rated the film 8/10 stars and wrote, \\"While not necessarily a film you will revisit time and time again, Drifter is one you will certainly remember.\\" Andrew Mack of Screen Anarchy wrote that the film \\"starts off promising enough\\" but becomes \\"terribly boring and bland\\" after the brothers arrive in the town. Mack said the cannibals behave logically by killing off Dominic, but this leaves the film without an interesting protagonist. Mack concluded von Hoffmann can create \\"visually stimulating films\\" once he works on better character arcs.

It was a \\"sister\\" unit to the 393rd Rifle Division, which was formed at about the same time and place and shared a very similar combat path during 1941-42. The division was assigned to the southern sector of the Soviet-German front during the winter counteroffensive, but was encircled during the German spring offensive that formed the Izium Pocket; unable to escape as a formed unit, the scattered survivors were not sufficient to warrant rebuilding the division, and it was officially disbanded on June 30, 1942. The 411th had one of the shortest and least distinguished careers of any Soviet rifle division. Formation The division was formed in August and September, 1941 in the Kharkov Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 Like the 393rd Rifle Division, it was probably formed from a cadre of militia raised in the Kharkov area from late August. Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was as follows: * 678th Rifle Regiment * 686th Rifle Regiment * 689th Rifle RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 113 * 965th Artillery Regiment * 68th Antitank Battalion * 421st Anti-aircraft Battery (later 689th Antiaircraft Battalion) * 546th Mortar Battalion * 464th Reconnaissance Company * 683rd Sapper Battalion * 853rd Signal Battalion * 487th Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 480th Chemical Protection (Anti-gas) Company * 303rd Motor Transport Company * 318th Field Bakery * 830th Divisional Veterinary Hospital (later 712th) * 1413th Field Postal Station * 760th Field Office of the State Bank In September, the division was briefly assigned to the re-forming 10th Army, in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In the following month the division was reassigned to 6th Army in Southwestern Front, where it would remain for the remainder of its existence. The division took part in the winter counter-offensive which led to the creation of the Izium salient south of Kharkov.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 113David M. Glantz, Kharkov 1942, Ian Allan Publishing Ltd., Hersham, Surrey, UK, 1998/2010, p. 128 The only recorded commander of the division was Col. Mikhail Aleksandrovich Pesochin, who took command on April 15, 1942. Second Battle of Kharkov When the Soviet offensive to liberate Kharkov began on May 12, the 411th was part of the southern shock group, which was intended to advance northwards to the city from the Izium-Barvenkovo salient. The division was teamed with the 266th Rifle Division; each division had a fairly narrow penetration sector of about 4 km and they were supported by considerable artillery and tank assets. They faced the German 454th Security Division, which comprised mainly second- rate infantry with inadequate artillery support. In the first half of the day the Soviet divisions smashed the resistance of the German 208th and 375th Infantry Regiments, and by day's end reached the bank of the Orel River on a front from Novo-Semyonovka to Marevka.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 190-91 The southern shock group resumed the offensive on May 15. Advancing on the main axis of 6th Army, and facing heavy German air attacks, the 411th and 266th, supported by 5th Guards Tank Brigade, after great efforts, reached the Berestovaia River by the afternoon. One rifle regiment of the 411th liberated the village of Okhochae. This represented a further advance of about 15km, and the overall commander of the offensive, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, issued orders to commit two tank corps into the penetration on this sector at dawn on the 16th, but this did not take place because those corps were too far behind the front. Early on that day, elements of three German divisions struck the division's right flank as their forces continued to regroup. As part of this regrouping, III Motorized Corps was being concentrated south of the Izium salient facing 9th Army of Southern Front.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 222-26, 234-35 On the morning of May 17 the German counter-offensive struck 9th Army, and within hours had advanced 6 - 10km north on the Barvenkovo axis and 4 - 6km in the direction of Dolgenkaia. Although Timoshenko was unwilling to acknowledge the potential crisis over the next 48 hours, on May 19 at 1900 hrs. he issued combat order No. 00320, which stated, in part: In short, the bulk of 6th Army was to reverse front and advance eastward to defeat the counter-attacking German forces, or at least hold open a corridor to the salient.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 237-39, 383 During May 23 the German counteroffensive succeeded in encircling the Soviet Barvenkovo grouping and began widening the corridor; 1st Mountain Division was deployed in the center of the cordon to act as a switchline against any attempts to penetrate from either east or west. The following day the 411th, along with the remnants of 23rd Tank Corps, reached the face of the corridor east of Lozovskii, in the Panteleeva Balka region. At 1000 hrs. on May 25 it began its part in the breakout effort, which led to some of the bloodiest fighting in the whole Soviet-German War. By the afternoon of the next day, the Soviet troops who had not managed to escape were pinned in a 16-by-3km pocket along the Bereka River valley.Glantz, Kharkov 1942, pp. 288-95 The division was trapped and mostly destroyed, along with most of 6th Army, by May 27, although individuals and small groups filtered through the German lines for weeks. The STAVKA officially disbanded the division on June 30, and it was never reformed.Sharp, Red Tide, p. 113 One of the survivors of the disaster was Colonel Pesochin. He went on to command the 131st Rifle Division from July to September, 1942, and later commanded the 225th Rifle Division for nearly a year, beginning on May 29, 1944.http://www.generals.dk/general/Pesochin/Mikhail_Aleksandrovich/Soviet_Union.html. Retrieved May 13, 2017 He suffered a severe head wound on February 11, 1945, while leading his division during the Lower Silesian Offensive, and died in hospital on May 3, just as the war was ending.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. and trans. D.M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, pp. xxv, 170, 239-40, 259.

The solid suspensions are stored in energy storage tanks and pumped through electrochemical cells while charging or discharging. In comparison with a conventional redox flow battery where active species are dissolved in aqueous or organic electrolyte, the active materials in a solid dispersion redox flow battery maintain the solid form and are suspended in the electrolyte. Further development expanded the applicable active materials. The solid active materials, especially with active materials from lithium-ion battery, can help the suspensions achieve much higher energy densities than conventional redox flow batteries. This concept is similar to semi-solid flow batteries in which slurries of active materials accompanied by conductive carbon additives to facilitate electrons conducting are stored in energy storage tanks and pumped through the electrochemical reaction cells. Based upon this technique, an analytical method was developed to measure the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion battery active materials, named Dispersed Particle Resistance (DPR).

The episode aired on May 8, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. Plot =Opening= In a flashback, Chuck enlists Jimmy in an attempt to reconcile with Rebecca by inviting her to dinner at Chuck's house. Because of his EHS, he previously had all the electronics removed from his house. Rebecca doesn't know that Chuck believes he suffers from EHS, so he hides his illness by telling Rebecca that the power company accidentally turned off his electricity. Although Rebecca seems to accept Chuck's explanation, she answers a call on her cellular phone which causes Chuck to panic and knock the phone out of her hands. When Jimmy attempts to tell Rebecca about Chuck's EHS, Chuck forbids it and says Jimmy shouldn't be the one to break the news. =Main story= In 2003 , Jimmy asks Dr. Caldera if he knows \\"someone with a light touch\\" who would be willing to do a job. After a successful hearing before the New Mexico Banking Board, Kim informs Paige and Kevin of Chuck's allegations that Jimmy tampered with the Mesa Verde files. Neither Kevin nor Paige believe the allegations, which they attribute to Chuck not wanting to admit that he made a mistake. Kim assures Paige that Mesa Verde will not suffer any long- term negative effects from having to re-file one new branch application. The bar association's attorney intends to use Jimmy's taped confession, and Kim knows that Chuck will have to testify to its authenticity. This would allow Kim to cross-examine Chuck and bring up the details of his EHS. Before the hearing begins, Howard and Chuck arrange for the room to be as free of electricity as possible when Chuck testifies. Howard tells Chuck he doesn't need to testify because they have a solid case against Jimmy based on Howard's and David's testimony. He reminds Chuck that if he testifies, he is putting HHM's reputation at risk but Chuck is determined to see Jimmy punished and dismisses Howard's concerns. As the hearing begins, Kim and the bar's attorney make their opening statements, with Kim asserting that the real story is the feud between Jimmy and Chuck. Howard testifies first, explaining Jimmy's history at HHM and the fact that Chuck did not want to hire Jimmy, supposedly to avoid the appearance of nepotism. Kim counters this claim by pointing out that Howard was hired at HHM even though he was the son of HHM's founding partner. Jimmy's confession tape is played for the panel hearing the case. After Howard's testimony, he drives Chuck to the courthouse and Chuck bumps into Huell Babineaux as he is walking up the stairs to the hearing room. The hearing room is prepared for Chuck, including those present removing key fobs, watches and cell phones. To Chuck's surprise, Jimmy leads Rebecca into the room. Chuck obtains a recess and talks with Rebecca, who explains that Jimmy contacted her out of concern for Chuck's well being. She expresses sympathy, but Chuck tells her that Jimmy had her attend the hearing only as a psychological tactic to disrupt Chuck's testimony by making him discuss his illness in front of her. During cross-examination, Jimmy stands near Chuck, raises the issue of his EHS, and asks how close Chuck has to be to an electrical object for his symptoms to be present. He asks Chuck to identify the closest source of electricity and Chuck guesses that Jimmy is trying to trick him, so he asks if Jimmy has something electrical in his pocket. Jimmy reveals that he has his cell phone in his pocket and Chuck calls Jimmy's bluff by correctly guessing that Jimmy has removed the battery. Jimmy then asks Chuck to reach into his own pocket and when Chuck does he pulls out the fully charged battery from Jimmy's phone. Jimmy reveals he had Huell plant it on Chuck when they bumped into each other on the stairs and though Chuck has been carrying it for an hour and 43 minutes, he has not been affected by his supposed EHS. When the bar association's attorney argues that Chuck's apparent mental illness is an irrelevant detail in the context of the charges against Jimmy, Chuck finally loses control and goes on an angry rant about Jimmy's unethical and dishonest behavior. He desperately exhorts the panel to disbar Jimmy but stops in mid-sentence, realizing he has shocked everyone present into stunned silence. Jimmy somberly ends his cross-examination. Production The episode is directed by Daniel Sackheim, a first time director on the show, and written by Gordon Smith, who previously wrote the season 2 episode \\"Inflatable\\". This episode is the first time Jonathan Banks, who has appeared in every episode in the series so far, has not made an appearance as Mike. Lavell Crawford reprises his role as Huell Babineaux from Breaking Bad after last appearing in the season 5 episode \\"To'hajiilee\\". Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode received 1.76 million American viewers, and an 18‚Äì49 rating of 0.7. With Live+7 viewing factored in, the episode had an overall audience of 4.16 million viewers, and a 1.6 18‚Äì49 rating. =Critical reception= Michael McKean was singled out for his performance in the final scene The episode received universal acclaim from critics, with many considering it to be one of the best of the series. Terri Schwartz of IGN awarded the episode 10 out of 10, describing it as \\"the best episode of Better Call Saul to date\\". It currently holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes with an average of 9.5/10 based on 14 reviews. The site consensus reads: \\"The war between Jimmy and Chuck comes to an unprecedented climax in the heartbreaking, sober, and defining 'Chicanery', an episode that clearly cements Better Call Saul as essential television.\\" TVLine named Michael McKean the \\"Performer of the Week\\" for his performance in this episode, writing it was the \\"finest showcase yet for his fascinatingly layered performance as Jimmy's brother Chuck McGill.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club, who gave the episode an \\"A\\" rating, praised the courtroom scene, saying \\"it isn‚Äôt just to give us the satisfaction of a courtroom drama, the neat ending where the truth comes out. The brilliance of this structure is to give us a slow-motion view of the heavens falling, an outcome methodically pursued by Kim and Jimmy, which nevertheless seems to give them no satisfaction.\\" At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, Gordon Smith was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for this episode, his second for the series. Smith was awarded the Writers Guild of America Award for Episodic Drama. Many critics were disappointed when McKean, who was said to have given \\"one of the best performances by anyone in TV all year\\", failed to secure an Emmy nomination while his co-star Jonathan Banks did. =Analysis= The episode's final scene is an homage to the climactic courtroom scene in The Caine Mutiny, in which a suspicious, authoritarian, by-the-book Navy captain cracks under cross- examination. Uproxx noted that even the facial expressions of \\"Chicanery's\\" three committee members mirror those of three judges in Caine. (The film‚Äîwhich Vince Gilligan counts among his favorites‚Äîis also referenced in the Breaking Bad episode \\"Madrigal\\", in which Mike can be seen watching it.)

The agency splits its inventory of state highway mileage into four categories: *The State Primary System includes Interstate Highways, Parkways, and other long-distance highways of statewide importance that connect the state's major cities, including much of the courses of Kentucky's U.S. Highways. *The State Secondary System includes highways of regional importance that connect the state's smaller urban centers, including those county seats not served by the state primary system. *The Rural Secondary System includes highways of local importance, such as farm-to-market roads and urban collectors. *Supplemental Roads are the set of highways not in the first three systems, including frontage roads, bypassed portions of other state highways, and rural roads that only serve their immediate area. The same-numbered highway can comprise sections of road under different categories. This list contains descriptions of Supplemental Roads and highways in the Rural Secondary System numbered 3000 to 3499 that do not have portions within the State Primary and State Secondary systems. KY 3019 Kentucky Route 3019 is a rural secondary highway in southern Edmonson County. The highway begins at KY 101 (Chalybeate Road) south of Rhoda. KY 3019 follows Chalybeate Road north across Beaverdam Creek, a tributary of the Green River, into the village of Rhoda. The highway intersects Brownsville Road in the village and follows that road across a branch of Beaverdam Creek to its northern terminus at KY 259 (Veterans Memorial Highway) north of Rhoda. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 3019 along the bypassed portion of KY 101 and part of the bypassed portion of KY 259 through Rhoda via a September 23, 2002, official order after the latter highway was relocated around Rhoda. The agency transferred Brownsville Road between KY 3019 and the KY 101‚ÄìKY 259 intersection to county maintenance through the same official order. KY 3021 Kentucky Route 3021 is a rural secondary highway in central Edmonson County. The highway begins at KY 259 (Veterans Memorial Highway) north of Rhoda. KY 3021 heads north along Brownsville Road, which crosses a branch of Beaverdam Creek, a tributary of the Green River. The highway enters the city of Brownsville and ends at KY 259 (Main Street) south of downtown.

It has a rosette of leaves and up to 18 bluish-green and white flowers with dark green stripes. The flowers have a labellum with a dark green, beak-like appendage. It is similar to P. cycnocephala but is more robust and grows at higher altitudes. Description Pterostylis crassicaulis, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a rosette of between five and eight crowded, dark green leaves at the base of the flowering spike, each leaf long and wide. Between 5 and 18 shiny bluish-green and white flowers with dark green lines and long are borne on a flowering spike up to tall. Four to six stem leaves are wrapped loosely around the flowering spike. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal is curved forwards with the sides turned down. The lateral sepals turn downwards, are long and wide, dished and joined near their bases. The labellum is oblong to egg-shaped, about long and wide, pale green with a dark green, beak-like appendage pointing forward at its base. Flowering occurs from December to January. Taxonomy and naming The alpine swan greenhood was first formally described in 2008 by David Jones and Mark Clements and given the name Hymenochilus crassicaulis. The description was published in The Orchadian from a specimen collected in the Kosciuszko National Park. In 2010, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Pterostylis crassicaulis, publishing the change in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (crassicaulis) is derived from the Latin words crassus meaning \\"thick\\", \\"fat\\" or \\"stout\\" and caulis meaning \\"stalk\\" or \\"stem\\". Distribution and habitat The alpine swan greenhood grows in alpine and subalpine grasslands and herbfields in eastern Victoria and on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales.

A lysibody is a chimeric antibody in which the Fab region is the binding domain from a bacteriophage lysin, or the binding domain from an autolysin or bacteriocin, all of which bind to bacterial cell wall carbohydrate epitopes. This is linked to the Fc of Immunoglobulin G (IgG). The chimera forms a stable homodimer held together by hinge-region disulfide bonds. Thus, lysibodies are homodimeric hybrid immunoglobulin G molecules that can bind with high affinity and specificity to a carbohydrate substrate in the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Lysibodies behave like authentic IgG by binding at high affinity to their bacterial wall receptor, fix complement and therefore promote phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils, protecting mice from infection in model systems. Since cell wall hydrolases, autolysins and bacteriocins are ubiquitous in nature, production of lysibodies specific for difficult to treat pathogenic bacteria is possible. Binding domains may be linked to either the N-terminus of the IgG Fc (as is the case for autolysins) or to the C-terminus (as seen with phage lysins - see figure). In both cases the binding domains are able to bind their substrates in the bacterial cell wall and the Fc is able to perform its effector functions (see ref 2 for more detail). Lysibodies may be used prophylactically to help protect surgical patients from bacterial infections, particularly methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and boost immune clearance in infected individuals. thumb Category:Monoclonal antibodies Category:Glycoproteins Category:Immune system ","title":"Lysibody"},{"id":"54031416","text":"Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance is the third solo album by Drive-By Truckers frontman Patterson Hood, released on September 11, 2012 on ATO Records.

He gives them the money, but immediately has them deposit it in a singing coin bank.

Some of the rebels in the group were former activists and protesters. They began to collect money, organized the units, and announced the formation of the group in August 2012. In October 2012, the National Unity Brigades rejected foreign political support. The group was a loose coalition instead of a unified group and it received funding from various rebel military councils in Syria. The group claimed to have good relations with all other rebel groups \\"without exception\\" and have fought in battles \\"side by side with Islamist and Jihadist brigades\\". In January 2013, 200 fighters of the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades on Mount Zawiya requested to join the National Unity Brigades. The request was denied due to the lack of sufficient resources such as ammunition for the group. The group recognized the Supreme Military Council, although it originally did not receive any support from it. On 18 May 2013, the Free Syria Front was formed by SMC commander Colonel Qasim Saad al-Din. Many groups in the National Unity Brigades joined the Free Syria Front. By October 2013, the NUB became an \\"autonomous coalition\\" within the FSF. In February 2013, the National Unity Brigades refused to cooperate with the al-Nusra Front. A fighter in the group stated that \\"al-Qaeda is hijacking the revolution\\". Tensions rose between the two groups on Mount Wastani in western Idlib.

Background Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n is a Mexican drug lord who headed the Sinaloa Cartel, a criminal organization named after the Mexican Pacific coast state of Sinaloa where it was formed. Known as \\"El Chapo\\" (\\"Shorty\\" in Spanish) for his stature, he became Mexico's top drug kingpin in 2003 after the arrest of his rival Osiel C√°rdenas of the Gulf Cartel, and was considered the \\"most powerful drug trafficker in the world\\" by the United States Department of the Treasury. He was captured on January 8, 2016, in Mexico after his third escape from prison. He was extradited to the United States a year later on January 19, 2017, to face charges there related to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzm√°n was convicted in federal court for drug trafficking crimes in January 2019. Provisions and analysis The legislation would require any money seized by the United States from Guzm√°n and other \\"drug lords\\" via asset forfeiture to pay for a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Jesse Ferreras, With El Chapo convicted, Ted Cruz wants drug lord's money to pay for border wall. It won't work: experts, Global News (February 13, 2019). This would be a change from the usual practice of the U.S. government, which is to deposit the seized assets of drug smugglers into the U.S. Department of Justice's Assets Forfeiture Fund, which is first used to \\"satisfying valid liens, mortgages, and other innocent owner claims, and costs associated with accomplishing the legal forfeiture of the property\\" and is also used to fund enforcement training, equipment, and investigations. Experts state that the legislation would be ineffective at raising sufficient sums for construction of a border wall. Although DOJ has estimated Guzm√°n's wealth at $14 billion based on an estimate of Sinaloa Cartel activities, Guzm√°n's actual savings are far smaller (possibly $1 billion or less), much of which may be laundered or concealed. Experts have also expressed concerns about the potentially negative impact of diverting forfeiture assets from law enforcement activities to a border wall. History Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the bill in the United States Senate in 2017. Companion legislation in the House was introduced in 2017 by Mo Brooks (R-AL) and co-sponsored by eleven Republican representatives: Kevin Brady (TX-8), Steve King (IA-4), Louie Gohmert (TX-1), Tom Garrett, Jr. (VA-5), Lamar S. Smith (TX-21), Walter B. Jones, Jr. (NC-3), Paul Gosar (AZ-4), Ron DeSantis (FL-6), Joe Wilson (SC-2), Gary Palmer (AL-6), and Kevin Cramer (ND-At-large).

Plot Donald Duck and his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie are busy working at their gas station when a radio station announces the winning numbers of a lottery for a new Zoom V-8 car. Donald is frustrated when his ticket does not have the winning numbers and throws away the ticket, but the trio hear that the radio announcer made an error and Donald's ticket has the winning numbers. Instead of telling the news to their uncle, the trio decide to pick up the car to surprise him. With the car they needed gas, Donald was in too bad a mood to comply and saying paying customers only. So the boys disguise their car, and one of the boys dresses up as a woman that got Donald's fancy, until he realized he was tricked by his nephews. With less than 10 minutes to spare, the trio rush to the radio station to pick up the car, and the station phone calls Donald about his nephews having a surprise for him. Upon returning to the gas station, Donald suspecting his new car being the boys' car pours oil sludge all over the new car, overfills the tires, and crushes it on the garage lift while the boys watch in disbelief. He laughs at the damage he has done to get back at the boys for tricking, believing he gave them what they deserved, until the radio announcer mentions his name as the lucky winner of the car, causing him to realize in horror he ended up destroying his own Zoom V-8 car, and all his ideals plans with it gone forever, faint out of embarrassment and shame. The boys on the other hand just shrug at each other thinking that their uncle just went crazy.

Aki, (died October 7, 1887) was a Chinese immigrant and businessman who settled in the Kingdom of Hawaii. In 1886‚Äì87, he was embroiled in the Aki opium scandal,, an infamous bribery corruption scandal involving King KalƒÅkaua and Junius Ka ªae reneging on a bribe Aki made to secure the sale of an opium license. Biography Tong Kee, who became known as Aki in Hawaii, was a rice plantation and mill owner at Waiau, in the  ªEwa District, on the island of Oahu. Chinese names in Hawaii were often written using the given name with the prefix Ah (Èòø), so Ah Kee became Aki. Because of the orientation of Chinese names, Aki became his surname instead of his Chinese family name Tong. In December 1886, Junius Ka ªae, who served as Registrar of Conveyances under King KalƒÅkaua, convinced Aki to present multiple bribes totaling $75,000 (of which only $71,000 was actually paid) to the king in order to secure the grant of an license to import and sell opium in the islands. Through multiple trips, the large sums of cash were smuggled into  ªIolani Palace where they were received by Ka ªae and the king. When the license was awarded to Chun Lung, the son of Chinese millionaire businessman Chun Afong, Aki demanded the return of the money and when the king refused he brought a lawsuit against the king. Twelve affidavits (totaling sixty-four pages) were released by Aki and others associated in the case detailing the scandal. The king's defense later claimed that the gifts were free will offerings from Aki and that the money was accepted reluctantly by the king. \\"The Opium Racket\\", from the Gynberg Ballads. An illustration on the ballad erroneously depicted Little You Lie wheeling a wheelbarrow full of bags of gold into the palace The opium bribery scandal was satirized in the political satirical pamphlet, the Gynberg Ballads published by Alatau T. Atkinson, editor of the Hawaiian Gazette, and possibly coauthored by Edward William Purvis, a former member of the king's military staff. Shipments of the ballads arrived from San Francisco on May 13, 1887 and was distributed widely despite attempts by the government to seize the printed pamphlets. One of the pages titled \\"The Opium Racket\\" summarized the scandal although changing the names of the participants. Aki became \\"You Lie\\", the king was transformed into the \\"Gynberg Duke\\" and Ka ªae became \\"Kiyi\\". An illustration on the ballad erroneously depicted You Lie wheeling a wheelbarrow full of bags of gold into the palace. This publication and the scandal would have negative impact on the king's and his cabinet headed by Walter Murray Gibson and lead to increase anti-Chinese sentiments among the foreign white community. Ultimately, this scandal became one of the corruption charges which led to the July 1887 coup of the king by his opponents and the forced signing of the 1887 Bayonet Constitution which restricted his executive power. Ka ªae was forced to resign. The new constitution also disenfranchised the naturalized Chinese residents of the kingdom and ushered in a race-based suffrage system which completely excluded Asians from voting or citizenship. Aki died on October 7, 1887 before the case ended. Ultimately the court ruled that money given as a bribe cannot be returned in a civil suit and the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled that the king also possessed legal immunity.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by executive producer Ken Woodruff and directed by John Behring. It was first broadcast on May 22, 2017. In the episode, Lee begins to have an identity crisis after finding more evidence about Mario's death and her possible role in everything that's been happening to her with a visit to Tetch in Arkham. Gordon and Bullock find the new clues that lead to the Court's bomb, using a map hidden within the crystal owls. However, their search is interrupted by Captain Barnes, who wants to kill Gordon for his previous actions. Bullock saves him and finds new evidence that will manage to arrest Kathryn for interrogation but Barnes is hell bent on meting out his perverted sense of justice. Meanwhile, Cobblepot and Nygma face each other in their cells while Bruce continues his training with the Shaman. The episode received positive reviews although the slow progression received some criticism. Plot Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) confront each other in their cells, with Nygma believing Cobblepot to be just a ghost or a hallucination. Meanwhile, Selina (Camren Bicondova) attacks Five (David Mazouz) on Wayne Manor until Alfred (Sean Pertwee) separates them. After the revelation Five is not the real Bruce, Five knocks Alfred and Selina unconscious. The Shaman (Raymond J. Barry) and Bruce arrive at Gotham. Lee (Morena Baccarin) has a dream where Mario (James Carpinello) puts his contaminated blood on her glass. In the GCPD, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) find new evidence that Kathryn (Leslie Hendrix) possesses multiple properties around Gotham and the duo set off to find one of the properties to find the bomb. On the property, they find a crystal owl and using their lights, they discover a map of Gotham City. A grenade is thrown and Barnes (Michael Chiklis) arrives in a suit, taking Gordon with him. Alfred decides to go look for Bruce but as Selina refuses, he tells her to leave and never come back, comparing her to her mother. The Shaman takes Bruce to another trip in which he tells him to lock away his mother's jewels in order to take away the pain. The Shaman then shows Bruce one of his memories where the Shaman discovered the Waynes' murderer and killed the person who ordered the hit. Gordon is taken to a property where he is confronted by Kathryn and then left with Barnes, who is treating Gordon on a trial acting as his \\"judge, jury and executioner.\\" Just before his attempted beheading by Barnes, he is rescued by the GCPD while Barnes escapes. Lee visits Tetch (Benedict Samuel) in Arkham and finds that he gave the virus to Mario so she could hate Gordon in order to destroy him and replies that the person to blame is Lee herself. Cobblepot and Nygma put their differences aside in order to escape from their cells. They manage to escape and give each other an advantage of six hours before killing each other. Bullock has Kathryn arrested and taken to the GCPD. When Alfred discovers this, he enters the interrogation room and stabs Kathryn to force her into revealing Bruce's location. Barnes arrives, knocking everyone in the building out with a grenade. Kathryn tries to reason with Barnes, who responds by decapitating her. Gordon manages to get a shotgun and shoots at Barnes' axe-tipped glove, cutting his hand and then knocking him down. Bruce completes the transition, feeling nothing about his parents' death, and now under the Shaman's mental control. Bullock has the owl statue fixed and displays the map but is notified that Barnes has escaped on its transference. They also find that the vial of blood with the virus has been taken. Gordon finally discovers who took it. The episode ends as Lee injects herself with the virus, showing her eyes and face getting infected.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by Tze Chun and directed by Mark Tonderai. It was first broadcast on May 15, 2017. In the episode, Gordon discovers more about the impending judgment planned for Gotham City by the Court of Owls. He learns they possess the Tetch virus and plan on unleashing a weaponized version of it over Gotham. Meanwhile, Lee finds evidence that Frank Gordon's death could be a staged suicide rather than a homicide, and thinks Gordon is involved. Elsewhere, Cobblepot begins planning to finding Nygma and seeks Gordon's help with this, while Bruce continues his training with the Shaman. The episode received generally positive reviews, with critics praising Gordon's storyline although Bruce's storyline and the slow progression received criticism. Plot In Arkham Asylum, Barnes (Michael Chiklis) is escorted by orderlies outside the prison for transference. He uses his strength to break free. However, he is confronted by Talon, who sedates him, although with some difficulty. All these events are watched by Tetch (Benedict Samuel) from his cell. Barnes is brought to the Court where Kathryn (Leslie Hendrix) has Professor Strange (B. D. Wong) draw some of Barnes' blood. Lee (Morena Baccarin) shows evidence to Bullock (Donal Logue), regarding Gordon's (Ben McKenzie) involvement in Frank's death, implying he may be involved in it. Ivy (Maggie Geha) visits Tabitha (Jessica Lucas) to ask for Selina (Camren Bicondova), discovering she is in hospital. She arrives at the hospital and is told by a doctor that Selina's injuries are so severe that she will probably die. Back in the Court, Strange is revealed to have weaponized the Tetch virus so that it can spread throughout the air. Meanwhile, Gordon takes samples from Kathryn's mask, sending these to Bullock. Having received information on Kathryn's identity from Bullock, Gordon sets off to her residence to hopefully learn more about the weapon/threat, but almost immediately is met by Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and Bridgit (Camila Perez) who demand information regarding Nygma's (Cory Michael Smith) location, although Gordon negates his knowledge. Cobblepot gives him a phone in order to call him later. Gordon infiltrates Kathryn's house and finds a Wayne Enterprises key-card hidden in a drawer. Discovered by Kathryn, Gordon bluffs his presence and informs Kathryn about Cobblepot's suspicions. Kathryn speaks of the weapon, and Gordon deduces from her comments that the weapon is the Tetch virus Elsewhere Bruce (David Mazouz) continues his training with the Shaman (Raymond J. Barry), who sends him into his parents' wake. He makes Bruce see the fact that he is still angry at his parents' death, and in order to move on, he needs to let it go. Arriving at the Wayne Enterprises lab the key-card accesses, Gordon and Bullock are attacked by a man infected with the virus. The man is stopped by Strange. Deducing they cannot arrest Strange without the Court bringing forward the release of the virus they opt to let him go, and in return, Strange gives them notes and a vial of the virus compound. Kathryn then calls Gordon. Gordon meets with Kathryn at a reunion of socialites where the plan is to place a dispersal bomb loaded with the virus. After Kathryn leaves, Gordon gives a discreet call to Cobblepot to inform him of the bomb. Gordon is guarded by Talon to ensure his loyalty. With the time running out, Gordon attacks Talon and during the fight, Bridgit arrives and kills Talon with a flamethrower, causing everyone in the building to flee. Ivy uses medicinal plants in order to cure Selina's illness, who is hell bent on killing Five. Gordon finds Lee leaving the GCPD and after a final confrontation regarding Mario's death, she leaves. Cobblepot is kidnapped and jailed in a cell by the Court, reuniting with a shocked Nygma. Kathryn meets with Barnes, telling him that Gordon is a threat for them and tells him to kill him, deeming him a traitor. Barnes replies he's guilty and he'll be his \\"executioner\\".

According to standard narratives of Islamic eschatology, the Yawm al-QiyƒÅmah (‚Äúthe Day of Resurrection‚Äù) is to take place at the end of time, at which point people will be called to account for their actions, and then be rewarded or punished accordingly. The NizƒÅrƒ´ proclamation of qiyƒÅma, however, is distinct in that it takes place within history, and, as such, assumes a special significance.  Proclamation  On 8 August 1164, ·∏§asan II assembled a public gathering at the fortress of Alam≈´t in order to deliver a message from the imƒÅm, who was believed to be in hiding at the time. At this ceremony, ·∏§asan II announced that the community had arrived at the time of qiyƒÅma, and that he himself had been designated as the imƒÅm‚Äôs khalƒ´fa. In October 1164, ·∏§asan II once again assembled a public gathering at Alam≈´t and Mu æminƒÅbƒÅd to proclaim the qiyƒÅma, however this time ·∏§asan II identified himself as God's khalƒ´fa, in effect designating himself as the imƒÅm and qƒÅ æim (\\"resurrector\\"). As such, ·∏§asan II became the first openly manifest imƒÅm in the NizƒÅrƒ´ period.  Meaning in NizƒÅrƒ´ IsmƒÅ øƒ´lism  According to Farhad Daftary: > Relying heavily on Ismaili ta æwƒ´l or esoteric exegesis, and drawing on > earlier Ismaili teachings and traditions, however, the qiyƒÅma was > interpreted symbolically and spiritually for the living NizƒÅrƒ´s. It, in > fact, meant nothing more than the manifestation of unveiled truth (·∏•aqƒ´qa) > in the person of the NizƒÅrƒ´ Ismaili imam. And as such, it was a spiritual > resurrection reserved exclusively for NizƒÅrƒ´s wherever they existed. In > other words, those who acknowledged the NizƒÅrƒ´ imam were now capable of > understanding the truth, or the esoteric essence of religion, and, > therefore, Paradise was actualised for them in this very corporeal world. The \\"symbolic\\" and \\"spiritual\\" interpretation of qiyƒÅma relates to the dialectic of the ·∫ìƒÅhir (\\"outward\\" or \\"exoteric\\") and the bƒÅ·π≠in (\\"inward\\" or \\"esoteric\\"), concepts that are fundamental to IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ doctrinal thought. In terms of religious belief and practice, this meant that the sharƒ´ øa (\\"religious law\\"), and the associated practices of taqiyya (\\"religious dissimulation\\"), had been abrograted to accommodate the ·∏•aqƒ´qa (\\"divine truth\\"). As Marshall Hodgson explains: > The end of the rule of taqiyya followed naturally from the coming of the > Q√¢ æim, whose manifest and universal power would make taqiyya unnecessary for > the protection of the faithful. But its meaning here was no longer simply > the guarding of the inner religious truth of the mission of  øAl√Æ from prying > Sunn√Æ eyes. All those outer forms which the Sh√Æ øa shared more or less with > the Sunn√Æs had come to be lumped together in popular Ism√¢ ø√Æl√Æ consciousness > as being enforced by taqiyya. In the Qiy√¢ma now the learned Ism√¢ ø√Æl√Æ > tradition, in the person of ·∏§asan II, was indirectly admitting the validity > of their notion. The lifting of taqiyya was made to involve the rejection of > all the outer ritual law. The im√¢m was now of his mercy granting permission > to live without cult, in the spirit alone, which he had formerly forbidden. > The end of the shar√Æ øa could conceivably have been presented as itself a > natural consequence of the Resurrection‚Äîand no doubt it was so taken in > part: there will be no laws in Paradise.

An area of disturbed weather formed along the monsoon trough near Yap on October 6\\\\. Although thunderstorm activity was initially displaced from the center, gradual development occurred nevertheless. The disturbance became a tropical depression on October 9, and a tropical storm the next day. While moving generally north-northwest towards Japan, Kelly attained typhoon intensity on October 12\\\\. Continuing to intensify, Typhoon Kelly reached its maximum intensity on October 15, but a weakening trend began thereafter. The next day, the typhoon passed over the islands of Shikoku and Honshu. By October 17, Kelly completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone. Across Japan, the typhoon was responsible for 452 landslides, 20 destroyed bridges, and 165 damaged roads. A total of 216 homes were destroyed, 24,044 houses were flooded, 99 ships were damaged, and 6,802 ha (16,810 acres) of farmland were damaged. The typhoon killed nine and injured seventeen others. Damage amounted to $365.6 million (1987 USD). Meteorological history Following multiple outbreaks of tropical cyclone activity across the Western Pacific basin in September 1987, a large ridge developed at unusually low latitudes of the basin, forcing the Intertropical Convergence Zone further south and making environmental conditions unfavorable for tropical cyclone formation. On October 6, the monsoon trough began to re- establish itself around the 5th parallel north as the ridge receded northward. The next day, satellite imagery indicated that a low-pressure area embedded in the monsoon trough developed south of Yap. Although shower activity was initially displaced to the north of the low, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, on the basis of increased circus outflow. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Within 24 hours of the issuance of the TCFA, thunderstorm activity gradually increased in coverage, and the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on October 10, although post-season analysis from the JTWC indicated that this occurred six hours earlier than operationally estimated. Despite a displacement between the surface and upper-level circulations, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC. Six hours later, the JMA followed suit. While moving north, the low-and upper-level centers of Kelly became better aligned on October 11, which resulted in strengthening. At 18:00 UTC, Kelly was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA. Six hours later, the JTWC reported that Kelly attained typhoon intensity. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to monitor the storm, with the agency assigning it the local name Oniang. At 12:00 UTC on October 12, the JMA followed suit and classified the storm as a typhoon. Twelve hours later, the JMA raised the intensity to , its peak intensity. After maintaining maximum intensity for 72 hours, the storm's forwards motion started to decrease, and on October 15, the typhoon turned to the north-northwest despite being forecast to recruve out to sea in response to a trough located over the Yellow Sea. At midday, the JTWC increased the intensity of Kelly to , equal to Category 2 status on the United States-based Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, and its peak intensity. On October 16, Kelly began to lose tropical characteristics and transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that day, the storm passed over Shikoku and then made landfall near Kobe while maintaining typhoon intensity. Kelly then emerged into the Sea of Japan, and at 06:00 UTC on October 17, the JTWC declared the system an extratropical cyclone. The JMA did the same six hours later, but continued to track the system through October 19. Impact The typhoon dropped heavy rainfall over much of Japan, with a maximum of in Shikano, including in a 24-hour span. Yanase Dam received of rain in an hour, the highest hourly rainfall total measured during the storm. A peak wind gust of was recorded in Murotomisaki. A total of 84 domestic flights were cancelled, including 36 flights on 16 routes to and from the Osaka International Airport. Four people died in the prefecture of Tottori when landslides swept their homes. Three other people were killed in Kagawa Prefecture, located on the island of Shikoku, because of flying debris. Offshore, a freighter, the Eleftheria II, was badly damaged when it slammed onto rocks off the coast of Shikoku, where its 24 crewmen were rescued. Overall, nine people were killed and seventeen people were wounded.

Early life and career The organ of St Magnus, London Bridge Robinson was born in 1682; in 1700 he was a chorister of the Chapel Royal, under John Blow. In 1710 he was appointed organist at St Lawrence Jewry in London, and in 1713 he became organist at St Magnus, London Bridge. The organ there, built in 1712, was the first in England to have a swell box, and in February 1712 it was first played in public by Robinson.Stephen Bicknel, The History of the English Organ. CUP, 1999. Page 154. On 20 September 1727, after many years as assistant to William Croft, he became organist of Westminster Abbey, remaining in the post until his death. Benjamin Cooke became his assistant in 1746. Robinson was also a teacher of the harpsichord. As a composer, there has survived the double chant in E flat at the end of volume 1 of Boyce's Cathedral Music. John Hawkins, in his book A General History of the Science and Practice of Music, wrote that Robinson had a florid style of playing the organ, which was popular with audiences; it was \\"calculated to display the agility of his fingers in allegro movements\\" rather than displaying \\"the full and noble harmony\\" of the organ.A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers & Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800. SIU Press, 1991. Page 26. He left a few organ compositions; among them two-part Voluntaries are the most common. Personal life On 6 September 1716 he married Ann, daughter of the composer William Turner; she had a singing career. They had a daughter who became a singer, and other children who died young. After Ann's death in 1741 he married Mary, and they had a son, John Daniel. Robinson died on 30 April 1762, aged 80, and was buried on 13 May in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey.

Life  Lin Yi-han studied at the National Tainan Girls' Senior High School. Her father is a famous dermatologist in Tainan. Throughout her life, she had studied in university twice, first at Taipei Medical University studying medicine, then at National Chengchi University majoring in Chinese literature. She didn't finish her study, as she quit after 14 days and 3 years respectively. Lin married in 2016, and committed suicide at her apartment in Taipei on April 27, 2017, shortly after the publication of her first and only complete novel Fang Si-Qi's First Love Paradise (ÊàøÊÄùÁê™ÁöÑÂàùÊàÄÊ®ÇÂúí), which tells a story of a teenage girl being sexually abused by her tutor. There's been speculation that the protagonist in this novel implies back to Lin herself, although Lin had denied it publicly. Lin became melancholic after 17 years- old, and had attempted suicide three times in following years, making public believe that the misfortune that befalls the main character of her sole novel may be based on the lasting effect of sexual assault that she might have experienced in her lifetime. She had asserted before, \\"every day there are only 3 things which come into my mind, whether I should eat, take sedative, or take my life!\\" After Lin's death, the government established a law requiring the identities of tutors at cram schools to be accessible to the public. Lin's parents accused Chen Guo Xing of sexual assault against their daughter, but lacking physical evidence, Chen was not charged with a crime.

She has taught at Chelsea College of Art and Design, Winchester School of Art, and the University of Nottingham. She has been based at the Bartlett School of Architecture since 2000, where she has been Professor of Architecture and Art since 2008. She was Director of Architectural Research (2004‚Äì10) and Vice Dean Research (2010-3). She is currently Director of Architectural History and Theory and leads the Bartlett‚Äôs Ethics Commission. Rendell obtained her BA (Hons) Architecture from the University of Sheffield in 1988, and her DipArch, University of Edinburgh in 1992, and practiced as an architectural designer with Anthony Richardson and Partners, and the feminist architectural co-operative, Matrix. She obtained her MSc in The History of Modern Architecture from UCL in 1994 and her PhD, ‚ÄòThe Pursuit of Pleasure: Architecture in London 1821‚Äì8‚Äô, from Birkbeck College, University of London in 1998, supervised by Professor Lynda Nead. Work Rendell‚Äôs research, writing and teaching is transdisciplinary and crosses architecture, art, feminism, history and psychoanalysis. Her co- edited collections all explore different intersections between architecture and other disciplines, from those with an urban focus such Strangely Familiar (1996) and The Unknown City (2001), to those with a particular interest in architectural history, such as Gender, Space, Architecture (1999) and Intersections (2000), to those which examine the critical inflexions of art and architectural practice, such as A Place Between (1999), Spatial Imagination (2005), Pattern (2007) and Critical Architecture (2007). Her first authored book drew on feminist theory to explore the methodologies of architectural history, through an examination of rambling, as a pursuit of urban pleasure in 1820s London. In her subsequent book, Art and Architecture: A Place Between, she introduced the term ‚Äòcritical spatial practice‚Äô to investigate ‚Äòthe specifically spatial aspects of interdisciplinary processes or practices that operate between art and architecture‚Äô, and in Site-Writing she goes on to argue that criticism is itself a form of critical spatial practice. In The Architecture of Psychoanalysis she re-examines places between but this time in terms of transitional spaces, specifically those of the setting in psychoanalysis, and the history of the social condenser in architecture. Her most recent research engages with acts of displacement, related to the extractive industries, and to the London housing crisis and the displacement of tenants and leaseholders as a result of regeneration schemes specifically in Southwark. Her publications on these topics include ‚ÄòGiving an Account of Oneself, Architecturally‚Äô, the Journal of Visual Culture; ‚ÄòCritical Spatial Practice as Parrhesia‚Äô, special issue of MaHKUscript, Journal of Fine Art Research; co-edited with Michal Murawski, Reactivating the Social Condenser, a special issue of The Journal of Architecture (forthcoming 2017), and the fictionella, Silver (2017) for Lost Rocks (2017‚Äì2021) A Published Event. Rendell writes critical essays for artists, such as Daniel Arsham, Bik Van Der Pol, Jessie Brennan, Janet Hodgson, Jasmina Cibic, Apollonia Susteric and transparadiso, and for galleries and museums such as FRAC Centre, Orl√©ans; Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin; and the Hayward Gallery, London, and gives talks for arts agencies, events and galleries such as the Serpentine Galleries, London; the Tate, London; the Barbican Centre, London; the Venice Biennale; and Art Angel.

Distinguishing Characters The wasps in the subfamily Brachycistidinae are distinguished from the subfamily Tiphiinae by having simple claws and the lack of an epicnemial suture, while the tegulae do not cover the axillary sclerites of the forewing. These wasps demonstrate extreme sexual dimorphism the females resemble ants and are wingless while the males are winged and nocturnal. These extreme differences between the sexes have led to instances where the males and females are described as separate species, known as \\"dual-taxonomy\\", and later work shows the two \\"species\\" to be synonymous. The identification of both sexes as a single species is often only achieved when they are collected in copula. Biology The female wasps of the family Tiphiidae are mainly ectoparasitic on fossorial beetle larvae, especially members of the family Scarabaeidae and Carabid subfamily Cicindelinae, known as tiger beetles. The nocturnal, winged males are often attracted to lights and are therefore well represented in museum collections, the wingless females mainly live underground and are more difficult to collect, although they do emerge at night when they may also be attracted to lights. There are few observations of the hosts of Brachycistidinae but a female of the genus Stilbopogon was observed stinging a beetle larva which was identified as belonging to a species of darkling beetle probably a species within the genus Eusattus. Taxonomy The taxonomy of the subfamily is difficult to resolve due to similarity of the structures of the species and their lack of distinctive colouration and patterning.

This coherent conversion of the pump laser to a frequency comb takes place inside an optical resonator which is typically of micrometer to millimeter in size and is therefore termed a microresonator. The coherent generation of the frequency comb from a continuous wave laser with the optical nonlinearity as a gain sets Kerr frequency combs apart from today‚Äôs most common optical frequency combs. These frequency combs are generated by mode-locked lasers where the dominating gain stems from a conventional laser gain medium, which is pumped incoherently. Because Kerr frequency combs only rely on the nonlinear properties of the medium inside the microresonator and do not require a broadband laser gain medium, broad Kerr frequency combs can in principle be generated around any pump frequency. While the principle of Kerr frequency combs is applicable to any type of optical resonator, the requirement for Kerr frequency comb generation is a pump laser field intensity above the parametric threshold of the nonlinear process. This requirement is easier to fulfill inside a microresonator because of the possible very low losses inside microresonators (and corresponding high quality factors) and because of the microresonators‚Äô small mode volumes. These two features combined result in a large field enhancement of the pump laser inside the microresonator which allow the generation of broad Kerr frequency combs for reasonable powers of the pump laser. One important property of Kerr frequency combs, which is a direct consequence of the small dimensions of the microresonators and their resulting large free spectral ranges (FSR), is the large mode spacing of typical Kerr frequency combs. For mode-locked lasers this mode spacing, which defines the distance in between adjacent teeth of the frequency comb, is typically in the range of 10 MHz to 1 GHz. For Kerr frequency combs the typical range is from around 10 GHz to 1 THz. The coherent generation of an optical frequency comb from a continuous wave pump laser is not a unique property of Kerr frequency combs. Optical frequency combs generated with cascaded optical modulators also possess this property. For certain application this property can be advantageous. For example, to stabilize the offset frequency of the Kerr frequency comb one can directly apply feedback to the pump laser frequency. In principle it is also possible to generate a Kerr frequency comb around a particular continuous wave laser in order to use the bandwidth of the frequency comb to determine the exact frequency of the continuous wave laser. Since their first demonstration in silica micro-toroid resonators, Kerr frequency combs have been demonstrated in a variety of microresonator platforms which notably also include crystalline microresonators and integrated photonics platforms such as waveguide resonators made from silicon nitride. More recent research has expanded the range of available platforms further which now includes diamond, aluminum nitride, lithium niobate, and, for mid-infrared pump wavelengths, silicon. Because both use the nonlinear effects of the propagation medium, the physics of Kerr frequency combs and of supercontinuum generation from pulsed lasers is very similar. In addition to the nonlinearity, the chromatic dispersion of the medium also plays a crucial role for these systems. As a result of the interplay of nonlinearity and dispersion, solitons can form. The most relevant type of solitons for Kerr frequency comb generation are bright dissipative cavity solitons, which are sometimes also called dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS). These bright solitons have helped to significantly advance the field of Kerr frequency combs as they provide a way to generate ultra-short pulses which in turn represent a coherent, broadband optical frequency comb, in a more reliable fashion than what was possible before. In its simplest form with only the Kerr nonlinearity and second order dispersion the physics of Kerr frequency combs and dissipative solitons can be described well by the Lugiato‚ÄìLefever equation. Other effects such as the Raman effect and higher order dispersion effects require additional terms in the equation.

At the end of 1997 Hanson resigned from his father's public company, when it was broken up, to become chairman of Hanson Transport Group. In 1998 he founded Hanson Capital, a group of financial services companies aiming to capitalise on his worldwide network of relationships with major investors. This continues as part of the present group of companies. Hanson is now the chairman of Hanson Family Holdings, a private company which owns a wide range of businesses in logistics, investment banking and chemicals around the world. In 2013, Hanson used Hanson Family Holdings to buy Venezuela's best-selling newspaper, Ultimas Noticias, for a figure reported as $US98 million. In 2014, he was accused by newspaper staff of turning it into \\"a Socialist Party mouthpiece\\", but the editor, Hector Davila, replied that his only instructions from Hanson were \\"to run a balanced and profitable newspaper\\".

He studied classics at Magdalen College in Oxford and graduated with a BA First Class in 1862 and an MA in 1864. He took an interest in meteorology and became Vice President of the University Meteorological Society. Ley was ordained in 1863 serving in Herefordshire before becoming rector of Ashby Parva, Leicestershire in 1874. In 1873 he was elected a Fellow of the Meterorological Society and published a number of researches in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society.

He examined how cloud formations were related to the weather and examined the value of cloud observation in forecasting weather. He was possibly the first to examine upper air circulations and their relation to air flow in lower altitudes. He studied cirrus drifts and examined what are now termed as jet streams. He married Elizabeth in 1866 and they had eight children. He resigned from his clerical position in 1892 and died in 1896, two years after the death of his wife.

Early life He was born on 1 March 1903, in a Dalit/Scheduled Caste family of agricultural workers at the Ladavli village in Mahad Tehsil in the state of Maharashtra. At the age of 11, he began his struggle against untouchability. With the aid of some social reformers, he began sending letters to the British government for being denied admission to Mahad High School despite being awarded a scholarship on completing his primary education. Political career =Civil rights campaign= He was the main organizer of Mahad Satyagraha of 19‚Äì20 March 1927, which was led by Dr B. R. Ambedkar. More originally wrote a detailed account of Mahad Satyagraha in Marathi. The struggle of Dalits at Mahad for asserting their rights to access the public tank, the Chavadar tank, was arguably the first civil rights struggles in history. R.B. More was also the organizer of another convention at Mahad, Manusmriti Dahan Din (Manusmriti Burning Day), which was also led by Babasaheb Ambedkar. This convention took place on 25‚Äì26 December 1927, in which thousands of Dalits gathered together to publicly burn a copy of the Manusmriti. Ambedkar also addressed a separate meeting of Dalit women, as part of the convention at Mahad, asking them to shun social practices that perpetuate inequality. Reception Committee for Mahad Satyagraha =Communist party= In spite of the fact that More joined the then undivided Communist Party of India in 1930, under the influence of Marxism-Leninism, he and Dr. Ambedkar continued to maintain mutual admiration for each other's work. More consistently raised the issue of caste discrimination prevalent in Indian society at different forums of the Communist Party. He had sent a specific note on the \\"Problem of Untouchability and the Caste System\\" to the leadership of the party before third party congress in 1953. More submitted the note to the Politburo on 23 December 1953 with a request to place it before the forthcoming Party Congress. This note was later revised and sent again in 1957 and 1964. Along with appraising the contribution of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in the struggle for social justice, it emphasized the necessity of taking up issues of caste and social discrimination as an essential ingredient of class struggle. He also participated in the freedom struggle against British and working class movement with great vigor and remained \\"one of the most respected leaders of the CPI(M) till his death on 11 May 1972\\". He was elected to State Committee of CPI(M) in 1964. He started the weekly meeting, Jeevanmarg, of the CPI(M) Maharashtra state committee on 14 April 1965, the anniversary of Ambedkar's birth.

Early life Ihagama Rathanapala thero was born in the village of Ihagama of Harispattuwa in 1793 and was a monk in Malwatte temple when the British colonised the country.

Role in independence struggle Ceylon was ceded to the British in 1815. However resentment was brewing among the Sinhalese. The earliest attempt to evict them was led by Ihagama Unnanse, whose intention was to enthrone a Siamese prince. The plot was revealed by Ekneligoda and Ihagama Unnanse was arrested with two other monks. He escaped and lived in secrecy until the great rebellion began.

Diggs was the chairman of the delegation from Washington, D.C. for the National People's Party Convention, in Omaha, in 1892. It was the first time a woman ever led a delegation at a national political convention. She was a speaker for the People's Party in nearly every state and territory. She served as state librarian of Kansas, 1898‚Äì1902. A writer, Diggs served as the associate editor of The Advocate, Topeka, Kansas, and was the author of Little Brown Brothers and the Story of Jerry Simpson. Diggs died in 1916 in Michigan. Early years and education Annie Le Porte was born in London, Ontario, Canada, February 22, 1853 (February 22, 1848 is also mentioned), the daughter of Cornelius, a lawyer, and Ann Maria (Thomas) Le Porte. Her ancestry can be traced in a direct line to General John Stark, of the American Revolutionary War. In 1855, the family removed to New Jersey where Diggs studied with a governess, and also received education at a convent and public schools. Career Bedrock; Education and Employment On September 21, 1873, she married Alvin S. Diggs, a postal clerk of Lawrence, Kansas. She then began her career in public as a journalist, publishing the Kansas Liberal with her husband from their home in Lawrence. She entered the field to fight for political and personal independence and equality. Diggs also lectured before literary, reformatory and religious assemblages. She lectured on sociology. When the Farmers' Alliance movement among the western farmers began, she entered the field and soon found herself at the front among those who were engineering that industrial movement. During the political campaigns in Kansas and neighboring states, she made many speeches. She was chosen by the People's Party to reply to the platform utterances of John James Ingalls, which largely contributed to his overthrow. She was elected national secretary of the National Citizens' Industrial Alliance, at the annual meeting of that organization in St. Louis, Missouri, February 22, 1892. In 1881, she addressed the annual convention of the Free Religious Association, in Boston, Massachusetts, on \\"Liberalism in the West.\\" For years, she was a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Much of her journalistic work was done on the Advocate, the organ of the Citizens' Alliance, on which journal she served as the leading editorial writer. She spent much time in Washington, D.C., after the upheaval caused by the Alliance, and did notable work in correspondence for the western newspapers. Diggs served as president of multiple organizations including Woman's Alliance of the District of Columbia, the Kansas Woman's Free Silver League (1897), the Kansas Equal Suffrage Association (1899), and the Kansas Woman's Press Association.

The two shows took place on July 1 and 2, 2017, in Long Beach, California, United States at the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center. These were the first NJPW shows that the promotion had produced independently in the U.S. NJPW crowned the inaugural IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion during the weekend. The event's name refers to the annual G1 Climax tournament as these shows also served as a prelude to the 2017 G1 Climax. Production =Background= In December 2016, Pro Wrestling Insider reported that New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) was planning to hold the first two nights of the 2017 G1 Climax in the United States with New England-based wrestling personality George Carroll and wrestler Rocky Romero reportedly doing ground work for the dates in Long Beach, California. On January 4, 2017, during Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome, NJPW officially announced the shows for July 1 and 2, 2017, taking place at the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center. These shows, however, would not be part of the G1 Climax, but would instead serve as a prelude to the tournament, which would take place between July 17 and August 13. The shows would mark the first time NJPW presented shows in the United States independently, as opposed to partnering with an American promotion. NJPW had previously partnered with Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) for the NJPW Invasion Tour 2011 and since 2014 they have been partnered with Ring of Honor (ROH), co-producing shows annually in North America. Long Beach Arena, part of the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center After announcing the Long Beach shows, NJPW went public with their plan of an American expansion, which included establishing a subsidiary and running extended tours in the United States with California as the base, while also establishing a dojo for training Americans in Los Angeles, run by Rocky Romero. The full-scale running of the American market was set to launch in 2018. According to NJPW owner Takaaki Kidani, the plan was a direct response to WWE taking four wrestlers, including AJ Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura, from NJPW in January 2016. Tickets for the shows as well as meet-and-greets were put on sale on April 1 and sold out within hours, despite NJPW not having announced any matches for the two shows. Tickets were purchased in 37 states, including Alaska and Hawaii. Three days later, NJPW announced the first group of wrestlers taking part in the event; Kazuchika Okada, Tetsuya Naito, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kenny Omega. In May, NJPW put additional seats for the shows on sale, which were also quickly sold out. NJPW later claimed that the original tickets sold out in two hours and the additional tickets in two minutes. On May 12, during the third night of the NJPW and ROH co-produced War of the Worlds tour in New York City, it was announced that NJPW would hold a tournament to crown the inaugural IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion during the G1 Special in USA weekend. It was also announced that both the IWGP Heavyweight and IWGP Intercontinental Championships would be defended during the weekend. On May 18, NJPW held a press conference in Los Angeles to announce further details for the shows. This included the addition of 36 wrestlers to the shows, including Jay Lethal, The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) and War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) from ROH and Dragon Lee, Tit√°n and Volador Jr. from the Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) promotion. It was also announced that both the IWGP Tag Team and IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships would be defended during the weekend in addition to the previously announced titles. The two shows would air live through NJPW's internet streaming site, NJPW World, with English commentary. However, the first night would only air live outside of the United States, where both nights air on the AXS TV network; the first night live and the second night on tape delay on July 7. The English commentary for the shows would be provided by Jim Ross and Josh Barnett. On June 21, the Canadian Fight Network announced that it would also air the first night live. On June 12, NJPW announced the full card for the first night as well as a partial card for the second night. The full card for night two was revealed after the conclusion of night one. The release of the cards brought with them some negative reactions, mostly centered around American wrestlers Cody and Billy Gunn receiving shots at the IWGP Heavyweight and IWGP Intercontinental Championships, respectively. =Storylines= G1 Special in USA featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Cody, who challenged for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the first night The first night would be headlined by Kazuchika Okada defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Cody. The match was set up on June 11 at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall, where Cody, after defeating Michael Elgin, challenged Okada. After the main event of the show, where Okada had successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship by wrestling Cody's Bullet Club stablemate Kenny Omega to a 60-minute time limit draw, Cody repeated the challenge, which was accepted by Okada. Cody debuted for NJPW at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome on January 4, 2017, and went undefeated in his three singles matches in the promotion prior to the Long Beach show. Okada, while admitting he still did not know Cody or what he was capable of, accepted the challenge due to Cody being an American and his popularity in the United States. On June 23, Cody captured the ROH World Championship, turning the main event into a rare battle of world champions from two major promotions. The last champion versus champion match of this type took place in 2005 between IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion Satoshi Kojima. In the second title match of the first night, Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) were set to defend the IWGP Tag Team Championship against War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe). This would be a rematch from Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall, where the Guerrillas of Destiny became the new champions through cheating after Loa hit Rowe with a steel chair behind the referee's back. The first night would also feature all four first round matches in the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship tournament. The first match would take place between ROH wrestlers Hangman Page and Jay Lethal, who were the first two wrestlers to show interest in being part of the tournament, when the title was announced. The second match would see Juice Robinson take on Zack Sabre Jr. The two met as part of a NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship gauntlet match at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall. After Robinson had eliminated Sabre's Suzuki-gun team from the match, Sabre attacked Robinson and locked him in a submission hold. In the third match, Tetsuya Naito would take on Tomohiro Ishii in a rematch from Wrestling Dontaku 2016, where Naito successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Ishii. Naito had previously criticized the idea of the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship, claiming that it would hurt the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, which he held at the time. Naito had even brought up the idea of retiring the Intercontinental Championship prior to losing it and now stated that upon winning the tournament, he was going to immediately retire the United States Heavyweight Championship and throw the title belt in the garbage. In the final first round match Kenny Omega was set to take on Michael Elgin. Elgin went into the match holding two straight victories over Omega with their most recent match against each other having taken place during the 2016 G1 Climax. The second night would see Hiroshi Tanahashi defend the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Billy Gunn. Gunn had arrived in NJPW during the 2016 World Tag League as part of Yoshitatsu's Hunter Club stable. In May 2017, Yoshitatsu relayed a message from Gunn to Tanahashi, requesting a match between the two. After capturing the IWGP Intercontinental Championship from Tetsuya Naito at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall, Tanahashi immediately nominated Gunn as his first challenger. The IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship would be defended during the second night with champions The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) taking on Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero) in another rematch from Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall, where The Young Bucks captured the title from Roppongi Vice. The second night would also feature the conclusion of the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship tournament with two semifinal matches and a final match. Reception Following the event, it was noted that there were issues with AXS TV's production and commentary. Tama Tonga commented on the announcing, stating that it \\"sucked\\", adding that Kevin Kelly, the regular English announcer on NJPW World who did not announce the shows, \\"at least [...] knows the storylines and our f#cking names\\". Kenny Omega also voiced his support for Kelly and his broadcast partner Don Callis. Dave Meltzer reported that Kelly and Callis were in Long Beach and wanted to announce the shows \\"really bad\\", but AXS TV made the call to use their regular announce team of Jim Ross and Josh Barnett, adding that there was \\"a lot of infighting\\". Larry Csonka in his review of the first night for 411Mania, stated that Ross and Barnett \\"do a great job on the weekly, in studio and post produced calls for NJPW on AXS TV\\", but felt that the announcing on the live show was \\"really rough\\". Csonka also noted other production issues, including cameras missing important shots, bumper music playing over theme music and ring announcers starting and stopping their announcements. Aftermath Takaaki Kidani dubbed the event a big success, while announcing plans to tour the United States in March or April 2018 at the latest. He also stated that NJPW was going to open an office in Los Angeles before the end of 2017, with a dojo to be opened at the start of 2018. On November 5, 2017, NJPW announced Strong Style Evolved, the follow-up event to G1 Special in USA, which took place on March 25, 2018, at the Walter Pyramid in Long Beach, California. It was at that show that NJPW Chairman Naoki Sugabayashi announced there would be another G1 Special event taking place on July 7, 2018 in the San Francisco Bay Area at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California.

He created a comprehensive oeuvre of oil paintings and mixed media. Since he had also trained as a lithographer, he produced a large number of lithographic prints in his own printing workshop. The themes of his paintings and graphic oeuvre are landscapes, still lives, and also portraits and people.http://www.mz-web.de/halle-saale/halle-bleibende-spuren- hinterlassen-7364178 After completing school, Felsch did an apprenticeship in merchandising, which he could not complete due to the start of World War II. At the age of seventeen, he was enlisted into the German army and was moved to France, where he served as the chauffeur for a higher-ranking officer. After his first year in France, he was destined to be sent to Africa but instead was transferred to Russia, where he flew reconnaissance flights with the German air force. During one of the missions, he suffered a serious head injury which rendered him unfit to serve and he ended up in a hospital in Denmark where he stayed until the end of the war. After the war, Felsch moved back to his hometown, Wei√üenfels. He started an apprenticeship as a lithographer. In 1946, he enrolled as a student at the art school Burg Giebichenstein in Halle and joined the art class with the teacher Professor Charles Crodel. Felsch became part of group of painters which is now known as the ‚ÄúHallesche Schule‚Äù (school of Halle). It was a movement of modern painting during a period from 1945 until the late 1950s, under the influence of the professors of fine art Charles Crodel and Erwin Hahs. The term ‚ÄúHallesche Schule‚Äù describes a specific regional movement rooted in classic modern art. Felsch had a close personal and artistic bond with the painter Albert Ebert, which started when both met as art students and continued until Ebert died in 1976. This close artistic bond is reflected in many of his paintings. When Crodel was appointed professor for Fine Art at the Munich Art Academy in 1951, he asked Felsch to join him as his assistant and lithographer. After some consideration, he decided to stay in Halle due to family circumstances. In 1949, Felsch married his fellow student Brigitte Reiff. They both met at art school, as Brigitte was part of the same group of students under Crodel. They had a son and two daughters. Felsch and his wife regularly spent the summer months during the late 1940s to the mid-1950s in Ahrenshoop, a little fishing village on the Baltic Sea, known for their artist community. A number of paintings, drawings and lithographic prints originate from this time and reflect the partly rough but also gentle landscapes between the sea, with its dunes and cliffs, and the Bodden laguna. Felsch, with the support of his wife, worked on larger scale commissions of architectural art from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, which were mainly mosaic wall friezes in the lobbies of newly built hospitals and schools. There are still two of the previously three larger wall mosaics in the lift lobbies of the Policlinic Reil in Halle. A further 17-meter long wall mosaic frieze can still be seen in a school in Braunsbedra near Halle. In the late 1970s when their commercial opportunities were not as plentiful, the couple started to produce their own range of small ceramic medallions and ceramic jewellery, which helped to support them financially. Felsch carried on painting right up into his 90s. He particularly took pride in the frames of his paintings, which were meticulously made and most of them applied with a layer of flat silver. In 1951, Felsch became a member of the Landesverband Bildender K√ºnstler Sachsen-Anhalt (National Association of Fine Arts of Sachsen-Anhalt) and in 1952, he became member of the ‚ÄòVerband Bildender K√ºnstler der DDR‚Äô (National Association of Fine Arts of the GDR). He took part in numerous group exhibitions throughout Germany to include earlier participation in the art exhibitions of the GDR. 2014 Participation in exhibition of Crodel students in Halle. 2017 Exhibition of paintings, lithographic prints and drawings In London at STUDIO_13A. 2018 Exhibition \\"Heinz Felsch 1922 - 2016\\" Kunstkaten Ahrenshoop in corporation with Galerie Alte Schule Ahrenshoop. 2018 \\"Heinz Felsch 1922 - 2016\\" published in Hasenverlag Halle/Saale with introduction by Dr Paul Kaiser, Dresdener Institut f√ºr Kulturstudien.

Situation  The estuary of the St. Lawrence River is located downstream of the St. Lawrence River and upstream of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It refers to the place where the fresh and salt waters mix between the river and the gulf. The St. Lawrence Estuary begins at Lake Saint- Pierre and ends at the widening of the shores, at the height of Pointe-des- Monts, Quebec, opposite Les M√©chins, Quebec. It is divided into three sections: the St. Lawrence River estuary at √éle d'Orl√©ans (Orleans Island), the middle estuary to the Saguenay Fjord, the maritime estuary to Pointe-des- Monts, Quebec. The St. Lawrence Estuary is characterized by a saline front at the eastern tip of √éle d'Orl√©ans. The zone of contact between fresh and salt water corresponds to a region of high concentrations of suspended matter causing a zone of maximum turbidity (MTZ) of a length that can vary from , depending on the flow of the river.Silverberg and Sundby 1979 This zone of maximum turbidity is located between √éle d'Orl√©ans (salinity greater than 0 PSU) and √éle aux Coudres (salinity below 10 PSU). The mechanisms of estuarine circulation associated with this environment make it a privileged site of primary and secondary production which shelters many fish nurseries. High environmental turbidity provides shelter against predators while larvae are maintained under optimum temperature and salinity conditions.Sirois and Dodson 2000, North and Houde 2001, Winkler et al., 2003 Large variations in salinity and turbidity result in a wide variety of physicochemical conditions and planktonic communities on the river.  Fauna and flora  An emblematic species is the beluga (beluga whale), but many other species are present.

As a result of her development of a new technique to biopsy the small intestine in children, she has been credited with launching the subspecialty of paediatric gastroenterology. Early life Margot Last was born on 4 June 1923 to a Jewish family in Berlin, where her father worked as a textile merchant. In 1936, her family fled Nazi Germany to Prague; they settled in London in 1938. She attended Parliament Hill School and received a medical degree from the University of Leeds in 1947. She married Alex Shiner shortly thereafter, and they had three sons. Career After qualifying as a doctor, Shiner returned to London to work as a house officer. After completing her Diploma in Child Health in 1949, she became a house officer at Great Ormond Street Hospital and was an assistant medical officer in Hendon from 1951 to 1952. Seeking a career in research, rather than purely clinical care, she secured an appointment at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital, where she began researching paediatric gastroenterology. In 1957, Shiner joined the Medical Research Council (MRC) gastroenterology research unit at Central Middlesex Hospital under the leadership of Francis Avery Jones, and became a consultant gastroenterologist there in 1971. When the research unit was closed, she moved to an MRC research unit at Northwick Park Hospital. She left London for Israel in 1983, establishing a department of paediatric gastroenterology at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine. She was appointed visiting professor of paediatrics at Tel Aviv University and became an emeritus professor of medicine in 1991. In 1956, Shiner designed a biopsy tube that could be used to take biopsies from children's small intestines and could thereby be used in the diagnosis of childhood coeliac disease, Whipple's disease and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. She published the details of her technique in The Lancet. In 1963, she invented a sterile tube that could be used to take uncontaminated bacterial samples from the intestinal cavity; this allowed microbiologists to study the small intestine in greater detail than previously possible. Over her career, she authored 80 original articles, 14 book chapters, and the 1983 textbook Ultrastructure of the Small Intestinal Mucosa. Death and legacy Shiner died on 31 July 1998 in Jerusalem from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. John Walker-Smith credited Shiner's pioneering use of biopsy tubes to diagnose coeliac disease in children with launching paediatric gastroenterology as a distinct subspecialty. He said of Shiner's technique, \\"It offered a whole new era of understanding of disorders of the small intestine in childhood.\\" Her biopsy tube came to be known as the Shiner mucosal biopsy tube.

She created a comprehensive oeuvre of oil paintings and mixed media. She also produced a large number of lithographic prints and prints from wood cuts. The themes of her paintings and graphic oeuvre are landscapes and still lives, as well as portraits and people. She also produced a series of religious works during the 1950s, mainly prints from wood cuts. After completing school shortly after the start of World War II, she completed a combined housekeeping and tailor apprenticeship. In addition, she joined a painting circle in the theatre of her hometown Wei√üenfels, which influenced her to become an artist. Short after the end of the war, she applied to the art school Burg Giebichenstein in Halle an der Saale for the subject of painting and graphics. She was accepted and enrolled in 1947 as a student. She joined the class of the teacher Professor Charles Crodel. Felsch-Reiff was one of the very few women who were students in the class of Professor Charles Crodel at the art school Burg Giebichenstein Halle. This is where she met Heinz Felsch, her fellow student. They married in 1949 and had a son and two daughters. From this time on, the couple's professional lives were closely linked and they both worked on larger scale commissions of architectural art from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. These were mainly mosaic wall friezes in lobbies of newly built hospitals and schools. There are still two of what were previously three larger wall mosaics in the lift lobbies of the Policlinic Reil in Halle. A further 17-meter long wall mosaic frieze can still be seen in a school in Braunsbedra near Halle. Felsch-Reiff regularly spent the summer months during the late 1940s until the mid 1950s with her husband in Ahrenshoop, a little fishing village on the Baltic Sea, known for its artist community. A number of paintings, drawings and lithographic prints originate from this time and reflect the partly rough but also gentle landscapes between the sea with its dunes, cliffs and the Bodden laguna. In 1954, she created a series of lithographic prints about the Christmas story. She stepped into the public eye for the first time with her graphic work at the ‚ÄòFrankfurter Evangelischer Kirchentag‚Äô (Frankfurt Protestant Church Day) in 1956. In the same year she was also represented with a series of woodcuts for passion time at the exhibition of Christian Artists in Weimar. Felsch-Reiff became part of the group of painters known as the ‚ÄúHallesche Schule‚Äù (school of Halle). It was a movement of modern painting during a period from 1945 until the late 1950s under the influence of the professors of Fine Art Charles Crodel and Erwin Hahs. The term ‚ÄúHallesche Schule‚Äù describes a specific regional movement rooted in classic modern art. In the late 1970s, when their commercial work became less plentiful, she and her husband, Heinz Felsch, started to produce their own range of small ceramic medallions and ceramic jewellery, which helped to support them financially. Felsch-Reiff carried on painting right up into her 80s. In 1954, Felsch-Reiff became a member of the ‚ÄòVerband Bildender K√ºnstler der DDR‚Äô (National Association of fine Arts of the GDR).

Many of its buildings are either registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list, or part of Bydgoszcz local history.  Location  The street is located in the north-western part Bydgoszcz Old Town. It runs roughly along an east‚Äìwest axis, connecting the Old Market square () to Przyrzecze Street near Mill Island. It is about 110 m long. History Farna Street was laid out in the middle of the 14th century, during the formation of Bydgoszcz Old Town. It connected the north-western corner of the Old Market Square to the parish church () and to the streets: Jezuicka and Przyrzecze. The current architecture of the church dates back to the 15th century. In the vicinity of the edifice a cemetery had been standing till 1809, which gate and fences gave stood Farna Street. The history of this part of the city is related to the Order of the Jesuits, which owned a majority of the dwellings located between today's Farna, Jezuicka, Nied≈∫wiedzia streets and the Old Market Square. In 1619, the Society of Jesus erected a monastery here and around 1640, the construction of two Jesuit buildings on the Market Square closed one side of this quadrangle area: * St Ignatius of Loyola Church (); * Jesuit College (). During the Swedish Invasions (1660), most of the buildings were burned down, and many others were emptied by their inhabitants before the plague. Properties were then managed by churches, monasteries and hospitals: they were then called tagged as Jesuit. The structure of the street did not change through time, till the outbreak of the Second World War and the Occupation of Bydgoszcz by Nazi forces. In 1940, Werner Kampe, NSDAP Kreisleiter in the city, ordered the following buildings to be razed: * the western frontage of the Old Market square; * St Ignatius of Loyola Church; * the tenement house at the corner of the Old Market and Farna Street, which had been housing the Municipal Museum. Nazi authorities had planned to construct a new city hall, but never completed it. Since that time, Farna street never had houses on its southern frontage, the northern side (even numbers) being visible directly from the Old Market square, as it is today. Highlighted area shows buildings demolished in 1940 In the 1970s, Polish authorities started to revitalize fragments of the Old Town, including Farna Street. Final modernization of the street (pavement) was included in the Revitalization Plan of Bydgoszcz. =Naming= Through history, the street bore the following names: * 16th century - 1st half of 18th century, (Latin: Parish street) * 1750‚Äì1816, Pfarrstra√üe (German: Parish street) * 1820‚Äì1920, Alte Pfarrstra√üe (German: Old Parish street) * 1920‚Äì1939, Ulica Farna (Polish: Parish street) * 1939‚Äì1945 - Alte Pfarrstra√üe * Since 1945, Ulica Farna The street name refers to St. Martin and St. Nicholas Cathedral located at N¬∞ 10.

In the 1930s, it belonged to the Jesuit church of Bydgoszcz. Today, the tenement house belongs to Bydgoszcz parish church. This frontage was facing another one (bearing odd numbers) before the destruction of 1940. The facade, although influenced by neoclassical architecture, displays a nice frieze with stuccoed vegetal motifs. In addition, one can highlight the superb decoration of the main entrance portal, with stuccoes, festoons and a niche overlooking the street.

This frontage was facing another one (bearing odd numbers) before the destruction of 1940. The tenement house has been rebuilt and elevated at the end of the 18th century, then rebuilt again in the second half of the 19th century. File:Farna 4 Bydg.jpgView from the Old Market Square House at N¬∞ 6 1866 Eclecticism On the plot is proved to stand there in 1555 a house owned by a tailor, Wawrzyniec Kl·∫πk. A new house was set up in 1593: grand with deep basements, one storey and an attic under a Mansard roof. In the 19th century, Friedrich Kr√ºger, a tailor, owned the building at then Alte √üfarrstra√üe 5 before it was reconstructed in the 1860s. In the backyard has been found a commemorative plaque in latin with the date 1593 and the initials B.K., in memoriam of an owner of the house, Bart≈Çomiej Bartosz Krapiewski, who had a brewery and a mayor of Bydgoszcz from 1599 to 1603. The Krapiewski family lived in Bydgoszcz till 1672. A copy of the plaque has been put in 1961 in the building of the District Museum, at Gda≈Ñska Street N¬∞ 4.

The first registered landlord at Alte √üfarrstra√üe 4 was Peter Gottlieb Schul√ü, a member of the justice council in 1855. From 1866 to 1920, the tenement belonged to the Vincent family, merchants known in Bromberg, selling tobacco and cigars. Since 1920, the building has been the property of the catholic church () of Bydgoszcz. The edifice features eclectic elements, borrowed from neo-renaissance: adorned pedimented windows on the first floor and corbel tables crowning the facade.

A/783 (May 6, 1992) 1644-1653 Neoclassical architecture The edifice was initially a Baroque architecture building housing the Jesuit College in Bydgoszcz. The institution was established by Bishop Kasper Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski and Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski, Bydgoszcz Starostwo and Crown Chancellor. In the 17th century, there were apartments for Jesuits, a school with four to five classes, an alleyway adapted for school theater performances during school and church ceremonies, and a music hall for members of the school orchestra. Main construction works were carried out from 1644 to 1653, under the direction of Jesuit builder Wojciech Przyby≈Çkowicz. An expansion of the college was performed in 1696, thanks to funds donation made by Jan Stefan Komorowski, Malbork Regent, brother of Wojciech, then rector of Bydgoszcz Jesuit College (1689). Further constructions were carried out in the college between 1697 and 1709 under the direction of Wojciech G≈Çaznowicz, the last major reconstruction happening in 1726‚Äì1740. Jesuit college and St Ignatius of Loyola Church composed one of the most magnificent ensemble in Bydgoszcz. It struck less by the level of decoration than the quality of its various important guests: John II Casimir and his wife, together with Frederick William and his spouse in 1657, officers and generals of the Swedish and Russian armies during armed conflicts in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, the building was used as a Prussian Gymnasium. In the time of the Duchy of Warsaw, there was a Department of Primary School (1808-1812) and later a faculty (1812-1815) faculty. At that time, the school received the visit, among others, of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Tadeusz Czacki; Stefan Florian Garczy≈Ñski Polish poet and friend of Adam Mickiewicz studied there. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), a Prussian royal gymnasium was set up in the building (1871). In 1879, the ensemble was purchased by the municipality and became the seat of the city hall. To fit its need, municipal authorities ordered a reconstruction in 1878, supervised by building counselor Wilhelm Lincke, and helped by chief mason Albert Rose and chief carpenter Heinrich Mautz (who designed in 1845 Buchholz's tannery). Works remodeled the facade and adapted interiors layout to the needs of office activities. The opening ceremony took place on December 19, 1879. As a result of the reconstructions made in 1697, 1702, and during the 19th century, the edifice has gradually lost its original Baroque architecture to display Neoclassical features. The two-storey construction is a brick, plastered edifice with basement. Some rooms are barrel vaulted. The Town Hall is the only preserved fragment of the former Jesuit complex. The monastery and the church have been demolished in 1940. From 1994 to 1996, a general refurbishment of the facility was carried out, including a modernization and expansion of the eastern wing. On April 19, 2017, a new town hall clock has been unveiled on the facade. On the walls of the building are placed several plaques commemorating: * On the northern side, the 600th anniversary of Bydgoszcz (1946); * On the eastern side, the anniversary of the liberation of the city from German occupation (1950).

The house was rebuilt in the 1770s-1780s, in the Polish baroque style, its address was then Neue Pfarrstra√üe 14. In 1899, it was closely linked to the neighboring house at N¬∞ 4, housing offices of the \\"Stadtbriefpost Hansa\\", a post office ran by Mrs Schwarz, a widow. At the end of WWII, the building, then nationalized, fell into disrepair. Renovation only occurred in 1980, as one of the first houses aimed by the city project of restoration of the Old Town. Since that time the building houses the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society, with a scientific library, a reading room, editorial offices, a conference hall and a studio. In the 1990s, moved there the Library of the History Department of Kazimierz Wielki University, the Department of Culture of the City Hall, the Office of the State Service for the Protection of Monuments (), and the Provincial and Municipal Office for the Protection of Monuments. The townhouse has two storey with an attic and eyelid dormers; its horseshoe-shape footprint has wings onto Jezuicka, Farna and Przyrzecze streets. The upper part of the house displays an 18th-century Polish Baroque style, a passageway with an 18th-century preserved courtyard and an open wooden gallery. Front elevation on Jezuicka street is adorned with medallion-shaped sgraffiti designed by Witold Wasik, representing five scientists and artists associated with Bydgoszcz and the region: Emil Warmi≈Ñski, Jan Kasprowicz, Jan ≈öniadecki, Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki and Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski.

The building opened after the middle of the 14th century: first graduates traveled to Krakow to the Jagiellonian University around 1419 The parish school was an institution in the city landscape and in the awareness of its inhabitants, being then housed in a brick building containing several chambers, on the edge of the churchyard cemetery, on the plot of today's house at street in Przyrzecze street 2. In 1532, about 150 boys were registered, making it an important school at the time. It was then managed by the parson of the church. The main task of the school was to educate the youth, who later would perform the duties of priests. However, in the 15th century, its role changed in favor of a more \\"secular\\" curriculum: counting, measuring, reading and writing in Latin. A first level of the curriculum () included latin, grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. The higher degree () covered arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy. Further studies were possible in collegiate, and later at university. In the 17th century, the school declined, victim of the competition of the newly opened Jesuit College and established academic institutions in Gda≈Ñsk, ElblƒÖg, Torun or Che≈Çmno. By the beginning of the 18th century, the building was almost ruined, despite the efforts of the town council to take over the totality of school's costs. The construction in itself was used as a barn, and pupils transferred to a basic house erected on the eastern wall of the sacristy, furnitured with benches and tiled stables. During Prussian times, the actual building was erected (1834-1854) to meet the needs of the parish school, on the site of the older derelict edifice. In 1947 the building, part of Bydgoszcz parish estate, was transformed into a parish kindergarten. In 1982, the newly appointed Vicar of Bydgoszcz, Jan Viktor Nowak, inaugurated in the house the Primate Institute of Christian Culture - Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski (). In 1989, the institute was granted the status of State higher education institution. In 1990, it has been affiliated to the Theological Faculty of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ; since 1998, it is an official section of Pozna≈Ñ Theological University. With the establishment of the Diocese of Bydgoszcz in 2004, and the move, three years later, of the seat of the High Seminary of Bydgoszcz Diocese to the historic building at Grodzka Street 18, it was decided to move also the Primate Institute there. Since that time, the former parish school houses the library of the Primate Institute of Christian Culture. The long and low roof house has been erected in the middle of the 19th century, following wattle and daub technique that reminds of its old history. In the 1990s, the Institute had a thorough renovation carried out to fit its needs.

Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of it with informative tags. For example, a data label might indicate whether a photo contains a horse or a cow, which words were uttered in an audio recording, what type of action is being performed in a video, what the topic of a news article is, what the overall sentiment of a tweet is, or whether a dot in an X-ray is a tumor. Labels can be obtained by asking humans to make judgments about a given piece of unlabeled data. Labeled data is significantly more expensive to obtain than the raw unlabeled data. Crowdsourced labeled data In 2006 Fei-Fei Li, the co-director of the Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute, set out to improve the artificial intelligence models and algorithms for image recognition by significantly enlarging the training data. The researchers downloaded millions of images from the World Wide Web and a team of undergraduates started to apply labels for objects to each image. In 2007 Li outsourced the data labelling work on Amazon Mechanical Turk, a online marketplace for digital piece work. The 3.2 million images that were labelled by more than 49,000 workers formed the basis for ImageNet, one of the largest hand-labeled database for outline of object recognition. Automated data labelling After obtaining a labeled dataset, machine learning models can be applied to the data so that new unlabeled data can be presented to the model and a likely label can be guessed or predicted for that piece of unlabeled data.Johnson, Leif. \\"What is the difference between labeled and unlabeled data?\\", Stack Overflow, 4 October 2013. Retrieved on 13 May 2017. Data-driven bias Algorithmic decision-making is subject to programmer-driven bias as well as data-driven bias. Training data that relies on bias labeled data will result in prejudices and omissions in a predictive model, despite the machine learning algorithm being legitimate. The labelled data used to train a specific machine learning algorithm needs to be a statistically representative sample to not bias the results. Because the labeled data available to train facial recognition systems has not been representative of a population, underrepresented groups in the labeled data are later often misclassified. In 2018 a study by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru demonstrated that two facial analysis datasets that have been used to train facial recognition algorithms, IJB-A and Adience, are composed of 79.6% and 86.2% lighter skinned humans respectively.

In addition to making YouTube videos, Yuri releases rap music videos under the stage name MC Khovansky and used to perform as a stand-up comedian. He is well-known as a scandalous blogger on Runet.  Biography  Yury was born in Nikolsk, Russia, 19 January 1990. Yury was very active all his childhood, he loved playing football, staying at home, Yury spent a lot of time playing online games. Yury got interested in music when he was young and played the bass guitar in amateur rock bands. His parents wanted him to enter the Saint Petersburg State University of Engineering and Economics after school graduation but Yury did not manage to do it. Yury entered the Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics to become a programmer after that. Although he studied only for several years, Khovansky quickly realized that this profession did not suit him and he dropped out. He made a decision to get a higher education and graduated from another university, being a straight A-student, later. His early career has not brought him money or success. He has worked as a promoter, and a waiter, even a courier. Not feeling fulfilled, Khovansky changed his course of actions: it crossed his mind that he could create a channel on YouTube, the decision turned his world upside down.  Internet career  Yury uploaded the videos of foreign Stand-up comedians with his own Russian translation on the created YouTube channel in September 2011. He performed a variety of humorous songs which concerned social life and existence in his project That guy with the guitar (; ). Yury met renowned youtuber Ilya Maddyson (Ilya Davydov in real life), they ended up making videos together. Their collaborative works were an example of Russian modern satyre which manifested the actual problems of society. The first episode of Russian Stand-up became a new step of Yury's career, each video of that show was dedicated to current social problems or just reflections on life. His performances had a tendency to be hilarious and catchy like modern swanky tunes people heard on the radio. Yury's ability to speak his mind without any limits attracted an enormous quantity of YouTube users who considered his humor ‚Äî a new wave in modern art, pertaining to social life of the new generation. This very way of communicating with people made Khovansky extremely famous, the channel commenced gaining a lot of subscribers. Only four seasons of Russian Stand-up were released, as it was explained by Yury \\"he lost interest in the show quickly\\". There were other shows which made Khovansky's sense of humor iconic: Lexplay, Big steaming pile of sketches, Russian Drink Time, [standing], Shawarma-Patrol. After becoming very famous Yury labeled himself as the ¬´Emperor of humor¬ª and strongly emphasized that he was the first Stand-up comedian on the Internet. He is a judge in a rap battle Versus Battle in St. Petersburg. His popularity is still growing owing to his undeniable talent and a series of YouTube conflicts. The conflict with Dmitry Larin (true surname ‚Äì Utkin) ended up in a rap battle with Yury's glorious victory. After the battle Yury began to record satyric music videos in the gangster form, which gathered millions of views on YouTube. His first album My gangsta, released in 2017, caused a lot of commotion among rap singers who called it either good or extremely mediocre. A conflict with Kirill Kalashnikov, a famous producer, broke out in summer 2017. Yury turned down Kirill's invitations and was beaten by an unnamed Kalashnikov's friend. In the police office Yury was offered to deal with Kirill himself due to having a weapon license.

The park been recognized and accepted by the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience. It was thoroughly renovated in September 2018, with an outdoor classroom and a new scrupture, \\"The Spiral of Injustice.\\" Museum researcher Brigitte Sion has written that in seeking to use Anne Frank as a symbol for various universal and parochial issues, the memorial offers a sanitized version of Anne Frank that denies the reality of her history. Sion writes \\"Nothing in the Boise memorial's mission statement, its official literature, or at the site itself directly identifies Anne Frank as a Jewish victim of the Holocaust or explains the reason for her hiding, let alone for her arrest, deportation, and death in a Nazi concentration camp\\". The site not only serves as a convenient staging area for rallies, marches, and protests (and more generally as a contemplative spot), it is where the Boise Police Department takes their newly commissioned officers before field training. Vandalism In early May 2017 the plaque featuring the beginning of the complete Universal Declaration of Human Rights was vandalized with antisemitic graffiti in red marker; more generally two different areas of the site were also defaced over the next few days with racist slurs against black people and Jews causing $20,000 in damage, due in part to the botched initial attempts at repair. The vandalism, the first since the memorial's dedication in 2002, is being investigated as a potential hate crime, and numerous donations for repair have poured in.

The 12-bed Druid City Infirmary was quickly seen to be insufficient to serve the town's medical needs. With land donated by the University of Alabama, a bond issue and public subscriptions were used to fund a new hospital on a nearby site.

She has been described as \\"one of the most important writers who have begun to publish since the end of the Franco dictatorship\\" and has been credited with inaugurating \\"a renaissance in the short story genre in Spain.\\" Cristina Fern√°ndez Cubas  Biography and literary career  Fern√°ndez Cubas studied Law and Journalism at the University of Barcelona, where she met the writer Carlos Tr√≠as Sagnier, whom she later married. They have travelled extensively, and lived in many different cities, including Cairo, Lima, Buenos Aires, Paris and Berlin. Fern√°ndez Cubas practised journalism from an early age and published her first collection of short stories, Mi hermana Elba, in 1980. This was followed by Los altillos de Brumal (1983), El √°ngulo del horror (1990), Con √Ågatha en Estambul (1994), and Parientes pobres del diablo (2006), which won the Setenil Award in the same year. In 2009, her anthology Todos los cuentos was awarded several prizes, including the Premio Ciudad de Barcelona, the Premio Salamb√≥, the Premio Qwerty and the Premio Tormenta. She has written several novels, including El a√±o de Gracia (1985), principally set on the Scottish island of Gruinard, and El columpio (1995), the story of a girl's re-encounter with her three estranged uncles who share a house in a remote corner of the Pyrenees. In 2013 she published the novel La puerta entreabierta under the pseudonym Fernanda Kubbs, in which a sceptical journalist undergoes an unexpected transformation when she visits a clairvoyant. She has also written a play, Hermanas de sangre (1998), a book of memoirs, Cosas que ya no existen (2001), which, much to her delight, won the Premio NH Hoteles for short stories in 2001, and an outstanding biography of Emilia Pardo Baz√°n (2001). In 2016, Fern√°ndez Cubas was awarded the National Literature Prize for Narrative and the Premio de la Cr√≠tica Espa√±ola for her collection of short stories La habitaci√≥n de Nona (2015), translated into English as Nona‚Äôs Room. In his review in the New York Times, the critic Terrence Rafferty comments: \\"In these six elegant stories she‚Äôs most interested in the ambiguities and periodic disturbances that plague the imagination, and reports on them with the appropriate sense of awe, even of dread. In the territory of the imagination, the threat of madness is never too far away, a dark cloud hovering.\\" Another critic, Lucy Scholes, has commented that the author \\"brings darkness to light with uncanny flair\\", also warning that these, \\"off-kilter Gothic short stories are remarkable but not for the faint-hearted\\". In the words of the academic Phyllis Zatlin, \\"her stories tend to explore the mysteries of both external reality and of the human psyche. Most of them, including some that fall outside the fantastic mode, explore inner worlds of fantasy and unconscious desires\\".

Description The length of the shell attains 11 mm, its diameter 4 mm. The shell has a fusiform shape, ovally elongated, acuminate at both ends, with turriculated whorls. The rather thickened shell has a translucent crystal white color, when fresh. Longitudinal ribs originate at the suture. They are rather thin and high. These ribs (numbering 11 on the penultimate whorl), are frail, rounded. Fine and close striae (best seen under a magnifying glass) are distributed over the whole shell The relatively high shell consists of 8 whorls, separated by a sinuate suture. The 3 embryonic whorls in the protoconch are rounded, polished and brilliant. The next whorls are angular in their upper part. The body whorl measures about half the total length of the shell. Obtusely angular at the top, it offers a convex acuminate profile up to the base of the shell where it undergoes a slight compression. The siphonal canal is short, slightly reversed and recurved to the side of the outer lip. The aperture which does not reach half the total height is slightly oblique and narrowly suboval; The peristome is continuous. The columella is entirely smooth and is coated with a light enamel that thickens at the junction of the outer lip Slightly angular towards the suture, the outer lip, seen from the front, has a regular convex profile. In the plane of the aperture it is arched and slightly flexuous. Strongly thickened on the last rib, it has a crenate and sharp lip, and its interior is completely smooth. The sinus, located a little below the suture, is narrow, deeply seated in the apertural aileron, almost perpendicularly at the aperture.Hervier, J. 1898.

Location  Labudovo okno is located east of Belgrade. It is situated along the Danube from the ada of ≈Ωilava to the Serbian-Romanian border. Except for the small patch of the Danube's right bank which is in Central Serbia, all of the reserve is located in the province of Vojvodina, in the municipalities of Kovin and Bela Crkva. It also marks the border between the regions of Banat on the north and Braniƒçevo on the south. The name, Labudovo okno, in Serbian literally means \\"swan's (mine) shaft\\" or more colloquially, \\"swan's basin\\".  Geography  Labudovo okno is situated in the southern rim of the Pannonian Plain, between the Deliblatska pe≈°ƒçara on the north and the Danube's section of Ram Lake in the south. It developed when hydroelectrical plant ƒêerdap I began to fill its reservoir in the late 1960s, due to the backwater of the Danube so the water flooded surrounding plains. The area of the Deliblatska pe≈°ƒçara, which is the major sandplain, is arid and has no springs or creeks but in the alluvial plains of the Danube underground water forms permanent ponds in the hollows made by the wind in the sand. During the high water levels or floods, those ponds merge into larger lakes but also connect themselves to the Danube. The reserve includes the flow of the Danube and the floodplains along the Danube's banks, including the flooded mouths of the rivers Kara≈° (with its upstream meanders) and Nera so as the Danube's arm of \\"Dunavƒçe\\", swamps of \\"Dubovaƒçki rit\\" and \\"Zatonsjki rit\\", plains of \\"Stevanove ravnice\\" and the adas of ≈Ωilava, ƒåibuklija and Zavojska ada. Other features are the sections \\"ƒêurica\\", \\"Stevanova ravnica\\", \\"Mala ravnica\\", \\"Viƒá\\" and the Dubovac Island (Dubovaƒçka ada). The northern, Banat banks are partially made of loess and at some points almost vertical. They are pierced like a \\"sieve\\" with the birds' nests. At the widening section where the rivers of Kara≈° and Nera flow into the Danube, the Danube is almost wide. The entire wetland covers over .  Wildlife  = Plants = Water habitats include the permanent river flows, river shallows, flooded forests, and saltwater marshes. As a result, different plant communities developed in Labudovo okno. They include water and swamp communities of plants, wet plains and steppe pastures. Examples of the plants inhabiting the wet plains include pheasant's eye, glandular globe-thistle, Small yellow onion and mushrooms. The site is among the last one to contain some of the endangered and rarer water and swamp plants in Serbia, including European white water lily and yellow water lily. Hygrophilous forest are populated with the willow, poplar, pedunculate oak and the endangered Hungarian thorn, old man's beard shrubs and fungi. A special species of poplar inhabits the banks. It is locally called mazer, can live up to 300 years and is highly valued as a furniture material as its natural knots appear as dark roses on the white wood. The shallows are overgrown in reeds. = Animals = Labudovo okno is home to many freshwater molluscs, including freshwater clams, red-rimmed melania, and leeches, which make the base of the food chain. Most abundant species are the arthropods, with 1,200 species. Sandy banks are home to digger wasp, fossorial Heteroptera and many endemic beetles. Cross spider lives in the steppe-like sections. Water insects include mosquito, dragonfly, great diving beetle, diving bell spider, and crayfish. The reserve has 22 species of amphibians and reptiles. Given the size of the population of the Ponto-Caspian and Eastern Mediterranean elements, Labudovo okno is the most important center of the diversity of this type of fauna in Europe. It is inhabited by the frogs like Syrian spadefoot and European fire- bellied toad, lizards like Balkan wall lizard and European green lizard, and snakes like Caspian whipsnake. Marshes and shallows are an ideal natural spawning location for some 50 species of fish, which include common carp, northern pike, wels catfish, and sterlet. Labudovo okno is the most important nesting place, winter refuge, and migratory station for the waterfowls in Serbia. There are 55 species of them that nest in Labudovo okno, most of which are rare. It is the most important winter refuge in the Balkans for greater white-fronted goose, greylag goose, common goldeneye, white-tailed eagle, and greater spotted eagle. It is also the most important nesting area for the pygmy cormorant in Serbia and the only nesting location of glossy ibis. Over 20,000 of wading birds live in Labudovo okno, including swans, which gave name to the location. During migration, reproduction and wintering there are over 40,000 of little egrets, common pochards and smews. Sandy banks of the Danube are home to the largest European colony of sand martin with 15,000 couples. Altogether, during Januaries, on the long Labudovo okno, there are 80,000 birds which makes 20% of all winter bird population in Serbia. There are total of 250 bird species in the area, also including Eurasian coot, grebe, gull, water rail, merganser, osprey, cormorant, little bittern, black-crowned night heron, grey heron, shelduck, mallard, Eurasian teal, Eurasian wigeon, gadwall, tufted duck, northern pintail, and northern shoveler. Labudovo okno is also location of the largest European colony of European bee-eater. Geese fly to the surrounding fields in daytime, feasting on grains, while they return to the wetland in the evenings when ducks leave the water and fly to feed inland during the night. There are 39 mammalian species in Labudovo okno. There are several hundreds of jackals, organized in packs of 10-15 animals. The most important mammal is the endangered mole rat, which is on the IUCN Red List. The reserve is their most important reproductive center in the Pannonian Basin. There are also several species of endangered bats and a resident micro- population of otters.  Human history  The oldest human artifacts in the area date from the Bronze Age. According to the popular legend, this location was a stopover on the Jason and the Argonauts quest for the Golden Fleece. They named the Deliblato Sands area Laurion. Later stories involve the mythical wooden temple on the Dubovac Island, built by the ancient Slavs and dedicated to the gods Perun, Veles, and Wodan. The region was a foothold for the Roman army of the emperor Trajan, who progressed into the conquest of Dacia from here, after building the Trajan's Bridge across the Danube. During the Informbiro period in Yugoslav-Soviet relations after 1948, expecting the possible invasion from the Soviet block, the area was adapted into the Belgrade's first line of defense against the potential attack. Bunkers and ditches from the period still survive. The surrounding area is sparsely populated and the population is mostly agricultural. Main activities include fishing, sheep and cattle breeding and beekeeping. Local farmers mostly grow corn, wheat, sunflower, apples and grapes. St. George Shoots the Dragon, a movie directed by Srƒëan Dragojeviƒá and based on the drama of the same name by Du≈°an Kovaƒçeviƒá, was filmed in the area in 2008.  Protection  Labudovo okno habitat is protected by the IUCN Category IV and was declared a Ramsar wetland of international importance on 1 May 2006. Protected area covers . In 2017, Bird Protection and Study Society of Serbia, alarmed the public that Labudovo okno is more and more threatened and that level of protection must be elevated. Environmental agencies from both provincial and state level organized to make a plan to tighten the protection and possibly turn Labudovo okno into the ecotourism destination. The main problems include pollution, poaching, overfishing, sand digging, and urbanization.

He was known as the \\"Jackal of Wall Street.\\" George Graham Rice was born Jacob Simon Herzig in Manhattan to Simon and Anna Herzig. His father was a furrier. In 1890, Herzig was convicted of stealing from his father's business to finance his gambling habits and spent two years in the Elmira Reformatory. In 1895, Herzig was convicted for forgery and spent four years in Sing Sing, also for stealing from his father's business. He changed his name to George Graham Rice, which he took from another inmate. He then worked as a reporter for the New Orleans Times-Democrat. After that he returned to Manhattan and started Maxim & Gay Co., a racetrack tip sheet. However, it was put out of business by the Post Office Department. In 1904, Rice moved to Goldfield, Nevada and started Nevada Mining News Bureau, an advertising bureau, to promote mining stocks in which he had ownership stakes. In 1906, Rice co-sponsored with Tex Rickard a boxing match in Goldfield between Joe Gans and Battling Nelson, which was the longest boxing match in history, lasting 42 rounds. With Larry Sullivan, he opened the L.M. Sullivan Trust Company, which sold stocks. He promoted stocks in worthless mines in towns such as Rhyolite, Nevada, Bullfrog, Nevada, Wonder, Nevada, Broken Hills, Nevada and Greenwater, California. The L.M. Sullivan Trust Company failed in 1907, and Rice relocated to Reno, Nevada, where he published the Nevada Mining News. He started Nat C.

G. Pasteur called this Browerian mimicry, after Lincoln and his first wife Jane Van Zandt Brower. Life Brower studied monarch butterflies for six decades. Brower was born to Bailey and Helen Pierson Brower in Madison, New Jersey in 1931. He was raised in Chatham, New Jersey, where he showed interest in butterflies. In an oral history, he recalled being punished at school, being made to sit all day for skipping a class to go out and collect a species of moth; asked whether it was worth it, he stated \\"Absolutely\\". At high school he met Jane Van Zandt. He was educated at Princeton University where he gained a BA in biology in 1953. He and Jane married and took their PhDs in zoology together at Yale University in 1957, his on speciation in the Papilio glaucus group of butterflies, hers doing the first ever controlled experiments on Batesian mimicry in butterflies. They spent two years at Oxford University, the first as Fulbright scholars, in E. B. Ford's ecological genetics laboratory. He then lectured at Amherst College from 1958, rising to the endowed Stone Professorship in 1976. In 1980 he moved to the Zoology Department at the University of Florida. On retiring in 1997, he moved to Sweet Briar College as a research professor. A butterfly and moth collector from an early age, he began studying the biology of the monarch butterfly while a postgraduate at Yale in 1954, and became a world expert on the species over six decades. He contributed to over 200 papers and 8 films, combining research, public education about the monarch butterfly, and conservation work. Unlike some popular sources, Brower did not suppose the monarch to be in danger of extinction, though he agreed that its migration across America was threatened. He led a team of researchers studying the ecology of the overwintering grounds of the monarch in the mountains of Michoacan, Mexico, starting in the winter of 1977, incorporating aspects of thermal biology, predator-prey interactions, and chemical ecology. In the 1980s, he assisted conservation groups in Mexico and the Mexican government to protect fir forests used by the species from logging. In the last decades of his life, he recorded the sharp decline in the monarch population of North America, down by some 80% in the 20 years to 2018, attributed to herbicides, logging, and weather events. He was the only scientist to sign a 2014 petition to the US government to give the monarch legal protection. He advised the novelist Barbara Kingsolver on butterfly migration for her 2012 book Flight Behavior. Family He divorced Jane Van Zandt in 1974. He then married Christine Marie Moffitt; they divorced in 1980. He married his third wife, Linda S. Fink, in 1990. He had a son, Andrew Van Zandt Brower, who is also a biologist, and a daughter, Tamsin Brower Barrett. He died on July 17, 2018 in Nelson County, Virginia.

BlackBerry Limited, the creator of the BlackBerry brand, decided in 2016 to cease competing in the smartphone market directly, to focus on making security software. Due to this, TCL Communication is now in charge of manufacturing, distributing, and designing BlackBerry- branded devices for the global market. The BlackBerry KEYone is the first device made under BlackBerry Mobile brand, although it was partially designed by BlackBerry Limited. In February 2020, it was announced that TCL Corporation will stop manufacturing the devices on August 31, 2020, coinciding with the end of their access to the BlackBerry license. The last developed phone is the Blackberry Key2LE. Device software Devices made under BlackBerry Mobile will continue to be shipped running Android, along with security software, provided by BlackBerry Limited. This suite of software includes DTEK, BlackBerry Messenger, and BlackBerry Hub. Also, the software has a \\"secure boot\\" at start-up, to ensure that the Android system has not been tampered with. Many of these features are comparable to those from BlackBerry 10, BlackBerry Ltd's former flagship operating system. 2009 Blackberry Curve with BlackBerry OS 5.0 and 2017 Blackberry KEYone with Android 7.1 \\"Nougat\\" History In the early 2000s, Research In Motion Limited, other known as RIM, became dominant in the mobile industry, under the BlackBerry brand. They had a global dominance in the smartphone industry. In 2007, RIM had the highest growth of the BlackBerry brand. Afterward, they slowly lost dominance, as many consumers were moving towards devices like the iPhone from Apple and the Samsung Galaxy, due to their all-touchscreen form factor. Later on, the physical QWERTY keyboard on a smartphone became a significant feature of BlackBerry, which the brand was named after. RIM renamed to BlackBerry Limited, and then set a new strategy, this one focusing on improving their brand. The BlackBerry Priv was launched in 2015, as their first device running Android. The device came with a full touchscreen, with a QWERTY keyboard underneath. In 2016, BlackBerry Ltd outsourced production to TCL to manufacture the BlackBerry DTEK50 and DTEK60. Later on, in 2016, BlackBerry announced that they are moving away from in-house manufacturing and production, and moving to become a software security company. In December 2016, TCL was chosen to be the global licensee of the BlackBerry brand. At CES 2017, TCL showed off the rumored BlackBerry 'Mercury', although not stating any specifications of the device. Ahead of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, TCL officially announced the device, stating its official name is the BlackBerry KeyOne. This device was designed by BlackBerry Ltd. rather than TCL. The device is sold under \\"BlackBerry Mobile\\" brand.

Eucithara diaglypha (Hervier, 1897). In: MolluscaBase (2017). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433715 on 2017-05-13 Description The length of the shell attains 6 mm, its diameter 3 mm. The small shell has an oval shape with a very short turriculated spire. The crystalline shell is thickened. It shows flexuous longitudinal ribs. These are numerous, low, with a rounded ridge, joining to their extended base. They are transversally surmounted by high, numerous, rounded, fairly strong cords. These are polished and shiny, which give them a tuberculous appearance. Between these the surface of the costulae and their intervals is remarkably covered with very fine transverse striations, flowing like wavy lines and latticed by the growth lines. The coloring is a very bright yellow in the interstices of the high ribs, presenting a tuberculate projection of a bright hyaline white. The yellow color tends to disappear on the upper whorls and at the base of the latter. The shell consists of 6 to 7 (?) whorls. The fractured apex did not allow the study of the embryonic whorls. The upper convex whorls are distinctly cone shaped and are very short by a subcanaliculate suture. The body whorl, exceeding 2/3 of the height of the shell, is swollen in its upper part, and its convexity, barely depressed below the middle, advances regularly attenuated to the base. The oblique aperture is narrowly elongated. The continuous peristome forms over all the length of its insertion on the columellar lip one rounded, rather prominent small ridge. The convex outer lip is thickened, with a crenate, sharp margin and shows a series of 7 denticles. The slightly round sinus is lodged a little below the suture, notched in the thickening of the outer lip.Hervier, J. 1898.
