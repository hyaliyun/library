This volatile liquid consists of a cyanide group, that is CN, attached to a trimethylsilyl group. The molecule is used in organic synthesis as the equivalent of hydrogen cyanide. It is prepared by the reaction of lithium cyanide and trimethylsilyl chloride: :LiCN + (CH3)3SiCl -> (CH3)3SiCN + LiCl Structure The molecule exhibits the expected structure of a nitrile-like compound. The compound exists in a facile equilibrium with a small amount of the isomeric isocyanide (CH3)3SiNC. By contrast, the nearly isostructural tert-butyl nitrile does not readily isomerize to tert-butyl isocyanide. Reactions Trimethylsilyl cyanide hydrolyzes to give hydrogen cyanide and trimethylsilanol: :(CH3)3SiCN + H2O -> (CH3)3SiOH + HCN In its principal application, it adds across carbon-oxygen double bonds, for example in an aldehyde, to form a new carbon-carbon bond: : + (CH3)3SiC≡N -> N≡C-Si(CH3)3 The product is an O-silylated cyanohydrin. One use of this reagent is to convert pyridine-N-oxides into 2-cyanopyridine. This transformation is best done in dichloromethane solution using dimethylcarbamoyl chloride as the activating electrophile. It is possible to use benzoyl chloride but the yields and regioselectivity of the addition of the cyano group are lower. Safety This chemical is rated as \\"Fatal if swallowed, in contact with skin or if inhaled\\" as it hydrolyzes in the presence of moisture to give hydrogen cyanide gas.

It previously served as the main feeder prep school of Wimbledon College, a fellow Jesuit school located across the road. Both schools are under the governance of the Jesuits.Key Information Sheet (2010)Jesuit Education Donhead takes boys aged 4 to 11, after which they often continue their secondary education at Wimbledon College or at various independent or grammar schools across London. History =Origins= The name Donhead perhaps originates from the Anglo-Saxon \\"head\\" meaning top and \\"don\\" meaning hill – \\"the top of the hill\\". The building known as Donhead Lodge was built in 1867 and was first occupied by a barrister, one Freeman Oliver Haynes. Mr Haynes died in 1880 and soon after a Miss Elizabeth Arnold became the owner. In 1902 the house was taken over by Henry Smail and remained in the family's ownership until after the death of Mrs. Smail in 1932. By the early 1930s, Wimbledon College was looking for suitable premises in Wimbledon where the junior classes could migrate to form a preparatory school with its own headmaster. Fr Oscar Xavier Withnell SJ, Wimbledon College's rector at the time, was given first refusal to purchase the house immediately opposite the College gates at a purchase price of £6000. This house was \\"Donhead Lodge\\". Donhead's first pupils consisted of three classes named Elements, Preparatory, and Lower Preparatory, and numbered approximately 67 boys in total. They entered the school for the first time at 9:50 Monday morning 5 September 1933 under the guidance of Donhead's first headmaster, Fr Miller.Official Donhead website; accessed 30 September 2014. =Early years= Although the three classes had migrated across the road, the journey to and from the College was repeated many times as Donhead relied on the College continuing to allow it to use certain facilities - chapel, gymnasium, playing fields, etc. A special cap, tie, and blazer did not come into use until the second and third terms. Mr Wiber, with Fr. Rector's final approval, negotiated with the firm Dempsey's of Tulse Hill to supply a \\"Royal Blue\\" uniform, to get away from what was described as \\"the rather drab, College dark-blue\\". The \\"Royal Blue\\" colour was a distinctly lighter shade than what one might be familiar with today – one reason being that the original colour became impossible to get during the war. For many years the College authorities regarded Donhead mainly as a Junior Department and exercised fairly tight control on all aspects of the school. From the beginning the boys in each class were organised into two sides to compete against each other in the marks given for academic work (Romans and Carthaginians). The reward for the winners at the end of term was the \\"Victory Walk\\", originally an afternoon free of classes and taken up with a pleasant walk on Wimbledon Common. In the course of time alternative attractions replaced the walk but the title remained. Sport was an activity which relied on the use of the College fields on Edge Hill or at the recently acquired grounds on Coombe Lane. The recognised sports were Rugby and Cricket and the first school rugby match was against Kings College School (away) in November 1935, the Under 11 team losing by 0-18. Athletics was given a short season in the spring and early summer and Donhead were given some events on the College Sports Day. Other sports that took place were cross-country, boxing, swimming and croquet (on the Donhead lawn). The \\"House\\" system did not start till 1936 and initially there were two houses, Loyola and Xavier, with the first House Tea being held in July 1937, when Xavier beat Loyola by 715-677. For a short period of time, the Lower Preps had their own teams, Aloysius and Stanislaus. =Recent= In 2011, the school's Rugby Union Under 11A team were the National champions. They beat Blundell's in the final with tries from Chris Morris and Joshua Tiernan. Old Wimbledonians Association (OWA) The Old Wimbledonians Association came into being in 1905 and was founded by old boys of its Alma Mater, Wimbledon College.

The text of Libera me asks God to have mercy upon the deceased person at the Last Judgment. In addition to the Gregorian chant in the Roman Gradual, many composers have written settings for the text, including Tomás Luis de Victoria, Anton Bruckner (two settings), Giuseppe Verdi, Gabriel Fauré, Maurice Duruflé, Igor Stravinsky, Benjamin Britten, Krzysztof Penderecki, Antonio Salieri, Lorenzo Perosi, Arnold Rosner and Patrick Gowers (first stanza only). { Libera me, Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa tremenda Quando cœli movendi sunt et terra Dum veneris iudicare saeculum per ignem.

The text is written in the first person singular, \\"Deliver me, O Lord, from eternal death on that fearful day,\\" a dramatic substitution in which the choir speaks for the dead person. In the traditional Office, Libera me is also said on All Souls' Day (2 November) and whenever all three nocturns of Matins of the Dead are recited. On other occasions, the ninth responsory of Matins for the Dead begins with Libera me, but continues with a different text (Domine, de viis inferni, etc).

On the morning of January 1, 1797, the townsfolk witnessed the formal foundation of their town. The ceremony took place in front of the chapel, beside an image of the Virgin of the Rosary. (At the same time, Saint Augustine was chosen to be the patron saint of the town.) The name of the town was altered over time and became Villa de Merlo. One may see, in Marqués de Sobremonte square, plaques which commemorate the ceremonial founding of the town, and he may visit the old communal well and the chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rosario nearby.

The station was built as an addition to the airport to serve TGV trains on the LGV Rhône-Alpes, part of the main line running from Paris Gare de Lyon to Marseille Saint-Charles. It is situated about 20 km east of Lyon city centre. Overview Saint-Exupéry station was designed by Santiago Calatrava, cost 750 million Francs and opened on 3 July 1994, at the same time as the high- speed line to Saint-Marcel-lès-Valence. The building is mostly a combination of concrete and steel. The station has six tracks laid in a cutting. The two central tracks are isolated to permit trains to traverse the station at full speed (300 km/h) and have no platforms. The two external sets of tracks have 500 m long platforms. A small piece of land to the west is put aside for future expansion. Above the tracks, a 300 m long passenger concourse gives easy access to the platforms and is equipped with several travelators. The railway station is linked to Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport by a footbridge equipped with a travelator. This airport is historically the first to be served by a high-speed station. This proximity to the airport has not helped the station and it sees little use as passengers mainly use Lyon-Perrache and Lyon Part-Dieu. =Criticism= Lack of interconnection with Lyon's urban transport network is frequently cited for the station's low usage. The arrival of the Rhônexpress express tram (opened August 2010) is unlikely to change this as Lyon residents will still find it easier (and cheaper) to use the stations within the city. The main \\"advantage\\" of the station is for travellers, arriving by plane, who are travelling onwards to the east. The underutilisation of the station has led to lower access charges than for the busier downtown stations, leading to low-cost operator Ouigo making it part of its network.

Already flourishing in the second millennium BCE, the city was one of the oldest and most prosperous in Lycia; it gradually became one of the finest trade settlements in Greece. In the 4th century BCE Pericles adopted it as the capital of the Lycian League; subsequently it came under control of the Persian Empire. After Alexander the Great ended Persian rule, most of Lycia was ruled by Ptolemy I Soter; his son Ptolemy II Philadelphos supported the Limyrans against the invading Galatians and the inhabitants dedicated a monument, the Ptolemaion, to him in thanks. The five necropolises from this period demonstrate the city's importance. The mausoleum of Pericles is particularly notable for its fine reliefs and exquisite sculptures such as Perseus slaying Medusa and one of her sisters. Limyra is mentioned by Strabo (XIV, 666), Ptolemy (V, 3, 6) and several Latin authors. Gaius Caesar, adopted son of Augustus, died there (Velleius Paterculus, II, 102). The Romans cut a theater into the hill which held 8000 spectators. It was commissioned in the second century AD by important Lycian benefactor named Opramoas of Rhodiapolis. Also from this period are a bathhouse with a complex heating system and the colonnaded streets. The Roman Bridge at Limyra, east of the city, is one of the oldest segmental arch bridges in the world.Sopheone Pétridès, \\"Limyra\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) Ecclesiastical history Limyra is mentioned as a bishopric in Notitiæ Episcopatuum down to the 12th and 13th centuries as a suffragan of the metropolitan of Myra. Six bishops are known: Diotimus, mentioned by St. Basil (ep. CCXVIII); Lupicinus, present at the First Council of Constantinople, 381; Stephen, at the Council of Chalcedon (451); Theodore, at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553; Leo, at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787; Nicephorus, at the Council of Constantinople (879-880).

They are also called pentavalent antimony compounds. Types The first pentavalent antimonial, urea stibamine, was synthesised by the Indian scientist Upendranath Brahmachari in 1922. Though it caused a dramatic decline in deaths due to leishmaniasis, it fell out of favour in the 1950s due to higher toxicity compared to sodium stibogluconate. The compounds currently available for clinical use are: * sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam; manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline; available in United States [through the Centers for Disease Control only] and UK), which is administered by slow intravenous injection. * meglumine antimoniate (Glucantim; manufactured by Aventis; available in Brazil, France and Italy), which is administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection.Lima EB, Porto C, Motta JCO, Sampaio RNR.Treatment of American cutaneous leishmaniasis. An Bras Dermatol. 2007;82(2):111-24. The pentavalent antimonials can only be given by injection: there are no oral preparations available.

Characteristics  The station is a three-bore buttressed tunnel with ten pairs of boarding and deboarding accesses. It is 148 meters long in total, but the boarding platform spans only 100 meters. The walls of the station are covered with brown and gold, anodized, aluminum mouldings. The single lobby under Vinohradská Avenue is 5.6 meters underground. The lobby is connected to the street by three exits with escalators and to the platform by one long tunnel with escalators running in both directions. Behind the station are two hold yards and one reverse track capable of storing an entire train. Extension of the A-line to the Strašnická Station was achieved by boring tunnels from these auxiliary spaces. The reverse track is still used for reversing and storing trains even though the Želivského Station is no longer the terminus of the line. The construction of the station in 1980 cost approximately 301 million Czech crowns. The station has not been renovated since its construction and therefore still exhibits the original design of the first versions of the A-line. The system of overhead lighting units in the escalator tunnel along with the aluminum paneled walls function as a damper against the sound of the escalators which are loud by design. The lower spaces of the station have been subject to leaks which have in turn caused rust on the aluminum panels.

The colored areas are the fast explosive, while the white areas are the slow explosives. In an implosion-type nuclear weapon, polygonal lenses are arranged around the spherical core of the bomb. Thirty- two \\"points\\" are shown. Other designs use as many as 96 or as few as two such points. An explosive lens—as used, for example, in nuclear weapons—is a highly specialized shaped charge. In general, it is a device composed of several explosive charges. These charges are arranged and formed with the intent to control the shape of the detonation wave passing through them. The explosive lens is conceptually similar to an optical lens, which focuses light waves. The charges that make up the explosive lens are chosen to have different rates of detonation. In order to convert a spherically expanding wavefront into a spherically converging one using only a single boundary between the constituent explosives, the boundary shape must be a paraboloid; similarly, to convert a spherically diverging front into a flat one, the boundary shape must be a hyperboloid, and so on. Several boundaries can be used to reduce aberrations (deviations from intended shape) of the final wavefront. Invention As mentioned by Hans Bethe, the invention of the explosive lens device was contributed and designed by John von Neumann Use in nuclear weapons In a nuclear weapon, an array of explosive lenses is used to change the several approximately-spherical diverging detonation waves into a single spherical converging one. The converging wave is then used to collapse the various shells (tamper, reflector, pusher, etc.) and finally compresses the core (pit) of fissionable material to a prompt critical state. They are usually machined from a plastic bonded explosive and an inert insert, called a wave-shaper, which is often a dense foam or plastic, though many other materials can be used. Other, mainly older explosive lenses do not include a wave shaper, but employ two explosive types that have significantly different velocities of detonation (VoD), which are in the range from 5 to 9 km/s. The use of the low- and high-speed explosives again results in a spherical converging detonation wave to compress the physics package. The original Gadget device used in the Trinity test and Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki used Baratol as the low-VoD explosive and Composition B as the fast, but other combinations can be used. \\"Trinity\\" gadget. The alternating high and slow explosives (in purple) are the explosive lens which forces the spherical core to compress into prompt criticality. The illustration to the left represents a cross section through a segment of a polygonal wedge. The wedges are fitted together to form a spherical device. The exploding-bridgewire detonator at the far left triggers a semi-spherical detonation wave through the high-speed outer explosive. (It is semi-spherical because the exploding-bridgewire acts as a point-detonator.) As the wave is transferred to the precisely shaped inner explosive, a new spherical wave—centered on the object—is formed. The successful functioning of this device hinges on the simultaneous initiation of the wave in each segment, uniformity and precision in the speed of the wave, and correctness and accuracy in the shape of the interface between the two explosives. A series of experiments was performed in 1944 and 1945 during the Manhattan Project to develop the lenses for a satisfactory implosion. One of the most important tests was the series of RaLa Experiments. Initially, a 32 \\"point\\" assembly was used (each of which had a pair of exploding-bridgewire detonators). Later, a 92 \\"point\\" assembly was tried, with the objective of obtaining a smaller assembly with improved performance. Finally, with the success of the Swan device, a two \\"point\\" assembly became feasible. Swan used an \\"air lens\\" system in addition to shaped charges and became the basis of all U.S. successor designs, nuclear and thermonuclear alike, and featured small size, light weight, and exceptional reliability and safety, as well as using the least amount of strategic materials of any design. Other uses Lenses using alternate design techniques and producing flat \\"plane wave\\" outputs are used for high transient pressure physics and materials science experiments.

No solvent, water, or heat is needed to activate the adhesive. It is used in pressure-sensitive tapes, labels, glue dots, note pads, automobile trim, and a wide variety of other products. As the name \\"pressure-sensitive\\" indicates, the degree of bond is influenced by the amount of pressure which is used to apply the adhesive to the surface. Surface factors such as smoothness, surface energy, removal of contaminants, etc. are also important to proper bonding. PSAs are usually designed to form a bond and hold properly at room temperatures. PSAs typically reduce or lose their tack at low temperatures and reduce their shear holding ability at high temperatures; special adhesives are made to function at high or low temperatures. Structural and pressure-sensitive adhesives Adhesives may be broadly divided in two classes: structural and pressure-sensitive. To form a permanent bond, structural adhesives harden via processes such as evaporation of solvent (for example, white glue), reaction with UV radiation (as in dental adhesives), chemical reaction (such as two part epoxy), or cooling (as in hot melt). In contrast, pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) form a bond simply by the application of light pressure to marry the adhesive with the adherend. Pressure-sensitive adhesives are designed with a balance between flow and resistance to flow. The bond forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow, or wet, the adherend. The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress is applied to the bond. Once the adhesive and the adherend are in proximity, there are also molecular interactions such as van der Waals forces involved in the bond, which contribute significantly to the ultimate bond strength. PSAs exhibit viscoelastic (viscous and elastic) properties, both of which are used for proper bonding. In contrast with structural adhesives, whose strength is evaluated as lap shear strength, pressure-sensitive adhesives are characterized by their shear and peel resistance as well as their initial tack. These properties are dependent, among other things, on the formulation, coating thickness, rub-down and temperature. \\"Permanent\\" pressure-sensitive adhesives are initially pressure- sensitive and removable (for example to recover mislabeled goods) but after hours or days change their properties, by becoming less or not viscous, or by increasing the bond strength, so that the bond becomes permanent. = Effects of shape = The adhesive bonding of a tape or label can be affected by its shape. Tapes with pointed corners start to detach at those corners; adhesive strength can be improved by rounding the corners. Applications Post-it notes Pressure-sensitive adhesives are designed for either permanent or removable applications. Examples of permanent applications include safety labels for power equipment, foil tape for HVAC duct work, automotive interior trim assembly, and sound/vibration damping films. Some high performance permanent PSAs exhibit high adhesion values and can support kilograms of weight per square centimeter of contact area, even at elevated temperature. These build adhesion to a permanent bond after several hours or days. =Removal= Removable adhesives are designed to form a temporary bond, and ideally can be removed after months or years without leaving residue on the adherend. Removable adhesives are used in applications such as surface protection films, masking tapes, bookmark and note papers, price marking labels, promotional graphics materials, and for skin contact (wound care dressings, EKG electrodes, athletic tape, analgesic and transdermal drug patches, etc.). Some removable adhesives are designed to repeatedly stick and unstick. They have low adhesion and generally cannot support much weight. Sometimes clean removal of pressure sensitive tape can be difficult without damaging the substrate that it is adhered to. Pulling at a slow rate and with a low angle of peel helps reduce surface damage. PSA residue can be softened with certain organic solvents or heat. Extreme cold (dry ice, freeze spray, etc.) can cause viscoelastic materials to change to a glass phase; thus it is useful for removing many types of PSAs. Manufacture Pressure-sensitive adhesives are manufactured with either a liquid carrier or in 100% solid form. Articles such as tapes and labels are made from liquid PSAs by coating the adhesive on a support and evaporating the organic solvent or water carrier, usually in a hot air dryer. The dry adhesive may be further heated to initiate a cross-linking reaction and increase molecular weight. 100% solid PSAs may be low viscosity polymers that are coated and then reacted with radiation to increase molecular weight and form the adhesive (radiation cured PSA); or they may be high-viscosity materials that are heated to reduce viscosity enough to allow coating, and then cooled to their final form (hot melt PSA, HMPSA). Composition PSAs are usually based on an elastomer compounded with a suitable tackifier (e.g., a rosin ester). The elastomers can be based on acrylics, which can have sufficient tack on their own and do not require a tackifier.; bio-based acrylate – recently, a biological-based macromonomer was grafted onto a backbone of acrylate so that the resulting PSA uses 60% bio- based materials, butyl rubber, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) with high vinyl acetate content; can be formulated as a hot-melt PSA, natural rubber, nitriles, silicone rubbers, requiring special tackifiers based on \\"MQ\\" silicate resins, composed of a monofunctional trimethyl silane (\\"M\\") reacted with quadrafunctional silicon tetrachloride (\\"Q\\"). Styrene block copolymers (SBC), also called styrene copolymer adhesives and rubber-based adhesives, have good low-temperature flexibility, high elongation, and high heat resistance. They are frequently used in hot melt adhesive applications, where the composition retains tack even when solidified; however non-pressure- sensitive formulations are also used. High heat resistance, good low- temperature flexibility. Lower strength than polyesters. They usually have A-B-A structure, with an elastic rubber segment between two rigid plastic endblocks. High-strength film formers as standalone, increase cohesion and viscosity as an additive. Water-resistant, soluble in some organic solvents; cross-linking improves solvent resistance. Resins associating with endblocks (cumarone-indene, α-methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.) improve adhesion and alter viscosity. Resins associating to the midblocks (aliphatic olefins, rosin esters, polyterpenes, terpene phenolics) improve adhesion, processing and pressure-sensitive properties. Addition of plasticizers reduces cost, improves pressure-sensitive tack, decrease melt viscosity, decrease hardness, and improve low-temperature flexibility. The A-B-A structure promotes a phase separation of the polymer, binding together the endblocks, with the central elastic parts acting as cross-links; SBCs do not require additional cross-linking, styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), used in high-strength PSA applications styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS), used in low self-adhering non-woven applications, styrene-ethylene/propylene (SEP), styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), used in low-viscosity high-tack PSA applications, vinyl ethers.

The specific epithet eustachya, formed from the Greek words eu (true) and stachys (spike), refers to the racemose structure of the inflorescence.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Botanical history Nepenthes eustachya was probably first collected in February 1856 by Johannes Elias Teijsmann on the Sumatran coast near the port town of Sibolga. This specimen, Teijsmann 529, was designated as the lectotype of N. eustachya by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek in their 1997 monograph.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1–106. It is deposited at the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens along with two isotypes. Nepenthes eustachya was described in 1858 by Friedrich Miquel. In 1908, John Muirhead Macfarlane retained N. eustachya as a distinct species in his revision of the genus, titled \\"Nepenthaceae\\".Macfarlane, J.M. 1908. Nepenthaceae. In: A. Engler. Das Pflanzenreich IV, III, Heft 36: 1–91. B. H. Danser did not support this interpretation and instead treated N. eustachya in synonymy with N. alata in his seminal monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", published in 1928. He wrote: > N. eustachya Miq., only recorded from Sumatra and still distinguished by > Macfarlane, is united with N. alata in the above. In his monograph, > Macfarlane places N. alata in the group with carinate lid, N. eustachya > among the species without keel on the lid ; yet he distinguishes a N. alata > var. ecristata, without keel. For the rest there is hardly any difference to > be stated between these two species and especially the inflorescences are > strikingly alike. Danser also identified Ridley 16097 from the Malay Peninsula as N. alata, extending the species's range even further and making its apparent absence from Borneo difficult to explain. Ridley 16097 is now thought to represent a mixed collection of N. alba and N. benstonei.Clarke, C. & C.C. Lee 2012. A revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from Gunung Tahan, Peninsular Malaysia. Gardens' Bulletin Singapore 64(1): 33–49. Plants belonging to N. eustachya were identified as N. alata by a number of subsequent authors, including Shigeo Kurata in 1973, Mitsuru Hotta and Rusjdi Tamin in 1986, Mike Hopkins, Ricky Maulder and Bruce Salmon in 1990, and T. Sota, M. Mogi and K. Kato in 1998.Sota, T., M. Mogi & K. Kato 1998. Local and regional-scale food web structure in Nepenthes alata pitchers. Biotropica 30(1): 82–91. In 1997, N. eustachya was once again elevated to species rank by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek, who noted a number of differences between the two taxa. Charles Clarke supported this interpretation in his 2001 monograph, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. The specific epithet eustachya has been misspelled several times in the literature, including once by Otto Stapf in 1886 as N. eustachys and once by Jacob Gijsbert Boerlage in 1900 as N. eustachia.Schlauer, J. Nepenthes eustachya. Carnivorous Plant Database. Description Nepenthes eustachya is a climbing plant. The stem attains a length of up to 5 m and a diameter of 0.8 cm. Internodes are cylindrical in cross section and up to 12 cm long. Leaves are coriaceous and petiolate. The lamina is oblong-lanceolate in shape and can be up to 20 cm long and 5 cm wide. It has a rounded to emarginate apex, which may be sub-peltate. The petiole is canaliculate, not decurrent, and generally lacks wings. It clasps the stem for around half of its circumference. Two to four longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins arise obliquely from the midrib. Tendrils reach 15 cm in length. Rosette and lower pitchers are ovoid in the lowermost quarter and cylindrical above, frequently widening just below the peristome. They are up to 20 cm high and 4 cm wide. On the inner surface, the glandular region covers the ovoid portion of the pitcher cup. The pitchers lack wings, bearing a pair of ribs instead. The pitcher mouth is round and has an oblique insertion. The flattened peristome may be up to 5 mm wide. Its inner margin is lined with indistinct teeth. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 29% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90–102. The lid is sub-orbicular and lacks appendages. The spur is up to 4 mm long and generally bifid. Upper pitchers resemble their lower counterparts in most regards. They usually attain a slightly greater size and are infundibular in the uppermost quarter. Nepenthes eustachya has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 40 cm long, whereas the rachis reaches 30 cm in length. Partial peduncles are one- or two-flowered and lack bracteoles. Sepals are lanceolate in form and up to 4 mm long. Immature parts of the plant may bear a sparse indumentum of white, mostly caducous hairs. Mature parts are glabrous throughout. The stem and lamina are green. Pitchers are white to light pink with many red speckles. The underside of the lid is often darker than the rest of the pitcher. The peristome is usually yellowish and may bear red stripes. Ecology Climbing plants growing among ferns Nepenthes eustachya is endemic to the Indonesian provinces of North Sumatra and West Sumatra; its natural range stretches from Sibolga to the Padang Highlands. It has an altitudinal distribution of 0–1600 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Nepenthes eustachya usually grows in open, sunny sites on cliff faces and steep slopes at the forest margin. It is restricted to sandstone substrates and often grows on bare rock.Rischer, H. 2000. Growing Nepenthes in a Completely Inorganic Substrate. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 29(2): 50–53. Where the species does occur it is common and may form dense clumps, such as those growing beside the road from Sibolga to Tarutung in North Sumatra. Nepenthes eustachya grows in close proximity to a number of other lowland species, including N. albomarginata, N. ampullaria, N. gracilis, N. longifolia, and N. sumatrana.Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Another Nice Trip to Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4–10.Russell, G. 1985. Sumatran Expedition, January 1985. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 14(4): 97–101. It is known to hybridise with all of these species. The conservation status of N. eustachya is listed as Least Concern on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Related species Nepenthes eustachya differs from N. alata in a number of morphological features. Jebb and Cheek outlined these differences when they restored the former as a valid species. Nepenthes eustachya has a lanceolate lamina with a rounded to sub-peltate apex, whereas that of N. alata is lanceolate-ovate with an acute or attenuate apex. The petiole also serves to distinguish these species: in N. eustachya it is scarcely or not winged at all, whereas in N. alata it is broadly winged. The pitchers of N. eustachya bear a simple or bifurcate spur, compared to the simple and acutely pointed appendage of N. alata. Mature parts of N. eustachya are glabrous, while N. alata bears an indumentum of reddish or whitish hairs. Jebb and Cheek also compared the structure of the pitcher base: that of N. eustachya is angular and woody, being gradually attenuate towards the tendril. The base of N. alata traps, however, has a similar texture to the rest of the pitcher and is abruptly attenuate towards the tendril. Nepenthes alata exhibits great variability across its range and it is inevitable that some plants will deviate from the characters outlined by Jebb and Cheek. However, the overall combination of morphological differences appears to be stable and it is this that demarcates these species. Nepenthes eustachya bears a superficial resemblance to N. mirabilis. It can be distinguished from that species on the basis of its lower pitchers, which lack wings, its fimbriate leaf margins on short shoots, and coriaceous leaves, as opposed to chartaceous in the latter. Charles Clarke notes that the upper pitchers of N. eustachya, which have a pronounced globose base, may resemble those of N. clipeata from Borneo and N. klossii from New Guinea. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to confuse these species as they have little else in common and are geographically isolated from each other. In 2001, Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is a portion of the resultant cladogram, showing \\"Clade 5\\". It comprises the sister pair of N. eustachya and N. mirabilis with 72% support, as well as a weakly supported subclade (69%) that includes N. longifolia and the sister taxa N. rafflesiana and N. sumatrana with 58% bootstrap support. Natural hybrids Nepenthes eustachya is known to hybridise with a number of other Nepenthes species with which it is sympatric. Nepenthes albomarginata and N. eustachya grow in mixed populations at a number of locations in the Padang Highlands and Tapanuli. Natural hybrids between them appear to be relatively common around the river Tjampo in West Sumatra. A young plant of N. albomarginata × N. eustachya pictured in Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia was observed by Charles Clarke in 1998 on Bukit Kambut in West Sumatra. It grew in secondary vegetation amongst a population of N. eustachya at an elevation of around 900 m. This plant was subsequently destroyed, but Clarke and Troy Davis found a number of other plants on Bukit Tjampo. The hybrids were growing in a dense thicket of ferns (Dicranopteris linearis and Dipteris sp.) at approximately 750 m. Nepenthes albomarginata × N. eustachya often produces reddish leaves and pitchers. The characteristic white band of N. albomarginata is present just below the peristome. In common with N. eustachya, the indumentum is almost completely absent from the leaves, which are sub-petiolate and wider than those of N. albomarginata. No mature plants of this hybrid have been observed and, as such, the upper pitchers and inflorescence remain unknown. Nepenthes eustachya × N. longifolia has been recorded from a number of locations near Payakumbuh and Sibolga, where its parent species are sympatric. It is relatively rare because N. eustachya and N. longifolia occur in markedly different habitats; the former usually grows in exposed, sunny sites, while the latter is more common in dense, shady forest. This hybrid differs from N. eustachya in having fringed lamina margins bearing short reddish-brown hairs. The peristome often has a distinctive raised section at the front, a characteristic inherited from N. longifolia. It can be distinguished from N. longifolia on the basis of its shorter tendrils and the presence of longitudinal furrows on the surface of the lamina, similar to those of N. eustachya. In addition, putative natural hybrids with N. ampullaria,McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. N. gracilis, and N. sumatrana have been observed. References Further reading * Clarke, C.M. 2006. Introduction. In: Danser, B.H. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies.

The founders described the general style of the magazine writers as, \\"gritty, urban, sometimes ironic, sometimes gutsy, erotic, violent, or deadpan, unsentimental rather than 'sensitive' or 'psychological,' playing with form but clearly narrative by intention.\\" In 1984, Anthony Bourdain visited the apartment of the magazine, uninvited, \\"...dressed in chef’s whites and clearly high on heroin.\\" During that visit, he submitted his writing and drawings for publication. While Rose did not like the drawings, he did like the writing of Bourdain. The magazine eventually published a story written by Bourdain, which was about a chef scoring heroin on the Lower East Side. Over the years, Rose helped nurture the talent of Bourdain, and they eventually published a number of books together, including Typhoid Mary, and the graphic novels, Get Jiro!, Get Jiro: Blood and Sushi, and Anthony Bourdain's Hungry Ghosts, in 2018.  Books & Anthologies  In 1988, Penguin published the anthology Between C & D: New Writing from the Lower East Side Fiction Magazine for its Contemporary American Fiction series that included twenty-five writers chosen by Rose and Texier. As written in the book's introduction, \\"If you were living in Manhattan in the early eighties and didn't feel any affinity for the school of 'dirty realism' or weren't writing 'sensitive' narration teeming with believable characters a reader could care for throughout the lens of a novel, you were left high and dry on the Downtown shore. Between C&D; offered an exclusive forum for these writers, both established and emerging, whose voice were not being heard in the usual gamut of conventional literary magazines.\\" The magazine was discussed in the book Up Is Up, But So Is Down: New York's Downtown Literary Scene, 1974-1992 (NYU Press, 2006), written by Brandon Stosuy.

The specific epithet longifolia, formed from the Latin words longus (long) and folius (leaf), refers to the exceptionally large leaves of this species.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Botanical history The first known collection of N. longifolia was made by Willem Meijer in 1957. The specimen Meijer 6913 was collected on August 24, 1957, in a sandstone region of the river Tjampo near Taram in West Sumatra, at an altitude of 500–1000 m. The plant was growing in forest on the slope of a river valley. The specimen is sheet H.L.B. 958.85111 at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden. In 1986, Rusjdi Tamin and Mitsuru Hotta invalidly described Nepenthes rafflesiana var. longicirrhosa. Charles Clarke observed this taxon at the type locality in 1995 and concluded that it is conspecific with N. longifolia.Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Another Nice Trip to Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4–10. Subsequent revisions of the genus have formally synonymised these taxa. Nepenthes longifolia was formally described by Joachim Nerz and Andreas Wistuba in a 1994 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter. The holotype of N. longifolia, Nerz 2801, was collected by Joachim Nerz on September 25, 1992, in the Tjampo Mountains near Taram, West Sumatra, at an altitude of 1000 m. It is deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden. Seven other specimens of N. longifolia were collected on the same day and at the same location; Nerz 2802, 2803, 2804, and 2805 are deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands (L) together with the holotype, while Nerz 2806, 2807, and 2808 are held at the Institut für Biologie I at the University of Tübingen (TUB) in Germany. Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek treated N. longifolia in synonymy with N. sumatrana in their 1997 monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\". The authors tentatively upheld this synonymy in their 2001 revision, \\"Nepenthaceae\\", writing: > Although we treat N. longifolia as a synonym [of N. sumatrana], it is > representative of other specimens from inland Sumatra, at higher altitudes > (c. 1000 m) that show differences from the plants at sea level on the coast. > The inland plants have more slender pitchers which are ellipsoid in the > lower half and cylindrical in the upper (not infundibuliform), with an > elliptic (not a suborbicular) lid. However, intermediates are reported. More > specimens are needed before N. longifolia can be fully resolved. The most recent taxonomic revision by Charles Clarke, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia (2001), elevated N. longifolia to species status once again. Description Nepenthes longifolia is a strong climber; the stem often grows to 10 m and can attain a length of up to 12 m. It is up to 9 mm in diameter. Internodes are sub-cylindrical in cross section and up to 12 cm long. A lower pitcher Leaves are coriaceous in texture. The lamina is lanceolate to lanceolate-spathulate or lanceolate-obovate in shape and up to 55 cm long and 9 cm wide. It has an emarginate apex. The lamina is gradually attenuate into a short petiole (≤7 cm). The petiole is decurrent into a pair of wings (≤2 mm wide) that extend over almost the whole length of the internode. Three to eight longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are numerous but indistinct. Tendrils are usually shorter or as long as the lamina, although they may be as long as 110 cm. Rosette and lower pitchers are infrequently produced and are borne on very long tendrils. They are ventricose or narrowly ovoid in the lower part and cylindrical above. They grow up to 20 cm high and 5 cm wide. A pair of fringed wings (≤5 mm wide) runs down the front of the pitcher. The fringe elements are up 6 mm long and are spaced 1 to 3 mm apart. The pitcher mouth has an oblique insertion and is acuminate towards the lid. The peristome is flattened, up to 6 mm wide, and has a distinct raised section at the front, often with one or two notches. It is broadly cylindrical in cross section and bears a series of ribs spaced 0.2 mm apart. The glandular region covers the ventricose portion of the inner surface. Overarched glands are present at a concentration of around 500 per square centimetre. The pitcher lid or operculum is orbicular or ovate, up to 3 cm in diameter, and lacks appendages. A number of large round to ovate glands are concentrated near the midrib on the lower surface of the lid. An unbranched spur (≤15 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. A light green upper pitcher Upper pitchers arise gradually from the end of the tendril, forming a curve up to 4 cm wide. They are narrowly infundibular in the lowermost parts, slightly ovoid up to the hip, and cylindrical or tubulose above. Upper pitchers are produced on shorter tendrils, but are larger than their lower counterparts, growing to 25 cm in height and 4 cm in width. They have a pair of prominent ribs in place of wings, sometimes bearing fringe elements near the peristome. As in lower pitchers, the mouth is oblique, elevated, and acuminate towards the lid. The flattened peristome is up to 6 mm wide. It has a raised section at the front and is characteristically crumpled into 3 prominent folds. The glandular region covers the infundibulate part of the inner surface, with around 500 glands per square centimetre. The lid and spur are similar to those of lower pitchers. Nepenthes longifolia has a racemose inflorescence. Male and female inflorescences have the same structure. The peduncle is up to 25 cm long and 3 mm wide. The rachis is also up to 25 cm long. Partial peduncles are one- or two-flowered, up to 15 mm long, and may or may not be bracteolate. Sepals are ovate and up to 5 mm long. Stamens are approximately 5 mm long including the anthers. Seed capsules are up to 3 cm long. Most parts of the plant bear a short, sparse indumentum of simple and stellate hairs. However, many of these hairs are caducous and so mature plants appear mostly glabrous. The margins of the lamina are densely lined with short reddish-brown hairs. The stem and leaves are green, the latter sometimes having a reddish lower surface. Leaves of rosette plants often have a red midrib. Lower pitchers are generally brownish-red with a green to reddish-green peristome. The inner surface of the pitcher is usually pale green and the lid is red. Upper pitchers are characteristically light green throughout. Ecology Nepenthes longifolia occurs in the Indonesian province of West Sumatra and may also be present in North Sumatra. It grows terrestrially in dense, shady lowland or submontane forest on steep sandstone slopes and ridges. As a result of developing against such inclined surfaces, the leaves of rosette plants often assume an almost vertical orientation. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 300 to 1100 m above sea level. Around the river Tjampo in West Sumatra, N. longifolia is sympatric with N. adnata, N. albomarginata, N. ampullaria, N. eustachya, N. gracilis, and N. reinwardtiana. However, the species is only known to hybridise with N. eustachya. On Mount Tjampo itself, N. longifolia grows in a number of isolated patches and is sympatric with N. albomarginata, N. eustachya, and N. reinwardtiana. Plants resembling the type of N. longifolia are abundant along the road from Sibolga to Tarutung in North Sumatra. They differ from those of West Sumatra in a number of morphological features and may represent the poorly known N. beccariana. This taxon is sympatric with N. ampullaria, N. gracilis, N. rafflesiana, N. reinwardtiana, and N. tobaica. Nepenthes longifolia is not listed on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the list follows Jebb and Cheek in treating N. longifolia in synonymy with N. sumatrana. The combined conservation status for both taxa is listed as Least Concern.Clarke, C.M., R. Cantley, J. Nerz, H. Rischer & A. Witsuba 2000. Nepenthes sumatrana. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. IUCN 2006. Retrieved on 12 May 2006. However, recent studies have shown that these two taxa are distinct species. In 2001, Charles Clarke suggested a revised status of Vulnerable for N. longifolia based on the IUCN criteria. The habitat of this species may be threatened in the near future by fires deliberately started to clear forest for agricultural purposes. Related species Nepenthes longifolia is thought to be most closely related to N. sumatrana; the stem and lamina of these species are virtually identical in appearance. Nevertheless, N. longifolia can be distinguished from N. sumatrana on the basis of a number of significant and stable morphological differences. The tendrils on rosette leaves of N. longifolia are exceptionally long, reaching 110 cm, while those of N. sumatrana are not known to exceed 60 cm. As a result, the lower pitchers of N. longifolia are usually around 1/10 the length of the tendril, compared to 1/5 in the case of N. sumatrana. Although the lower pitchers on immature rosettes are similar in general morphology, the species differ in the shape of lower pitchers on rosettes sprouting from mature plants. Those of N. sumatrana are ovoid throughout, with an orbicular lid and the hip immediately beneath the peristome, and are contracted at an angle of 45° to the mouth. Those of N. longifolia are ovoid in the lower parts, having the hip around the middle and an ovate lid. In addition, the upper pitchers of N. longifolia do not give off a noticeable smell, whereas those of N. sumatrana have a sweet, fruity fragrance. In addition, the upper pitchers of N. longifolia are only infundibular in the lower parts, compared to the wholly infundibular aerial pitchers of N. sumatrana. Furthermore, the peristome of N. longifolia, although distinctly notched, is never raised at the front like in N. rafflesisna, unlike that of N. sumatrana, which has a very pronounced raised section. In their description of N. longifolia, Nerz and Wistuba also used the structure of the inflorescence to distinguish these taxa, but subsequent observations have shown that both species produce one- and two-flowered partial peduncles. Nepenthes longifolia is also closely related to N. rafflesiana. It can be distinguished from that species on the basis of its fringed leaf margins, very long tendrils of rosettes, upper pitchers that are cylindrical above the hip, and the notched peristome which is not greatly expanded near the lid as in N. rafflesiana. Plants that resemble the type of N. longifolia grow along the road from Sibolga to Tarutung in North Sumatra. They are atypical of the species in that the leaf bases are not decurrent along the internode, some of the hairs lining the leaf margins are caducous, and the plants grow in both exposed sites and amongst dense vegetation. This taxon is also similar to, and may be conspecific with, the obscure N. beccariana. Nepenthes beccariana was described by John Muirhead Macfarlane in 1908 based on a specimen collected on Nias, an island located approximately 120 km from the port town of Sibolga. Twenty years later, B. H. Danser synonymised the taxon with N. mirabilis in his seminal monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", although he did not see the type specimen of N. beccariana.Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, Série III, 9(3–4): 249–438. In 2000, Jan Schlauer and C. Nepi examined the type specimen of N. beccariana and noted significant differences between it and N. mirabilis, suggesting that it should be restored as a distinct species.Schlauer, J. & C. Nepi 2000. Notes on Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). II. Lectotypification of names based on material represented in the Herbarium Beccarianum. Webbia 55: 1–5. Charles Clarke agrees that N. beccariana appears to be distinct from both N. mirabilis and N. sumatrana but notes that if N. beccariana is found to be conspecific with N. longifolia, the latter taxon would become a junior synonym of the former. However, observations of N. beccariana at the type locality would need to be carried out to resolve this taxonomic confusion, since the type specimen of N. beccariana only consists of fragments of three leaves and three pitchers (two rosette pitchers and one upper pitcher) and is in a damaged state; the leaves are separated from the stem such that their attachment is unknown. In 2001, Clarke published a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia based on 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is a portion of the resultant cladogram, showing part of \\"Clade 5\\", which has 69% bootstrap support. The sister pair of N. rafflesiana and N. sumatrana has 58% support. N. beccariana was not included in this study. A rosette plant of N. adnata growing on a cliff face Seedlings of N. adnata and N. longifolia are virtually indistinguishable, although mature plants have few morphological features in common. Clarke writes that N. longifolia is likely to be one of the closest relatives of N. adnata. Natural hybrids Despite occurring sympatrically with a number of other Nepenthes species, N. longifolia appears to hybridise very rarely; only one natural cross with N. eustachya is known with confidence, although it may also hybridise with N. sumatrana.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Nepenthes eustachya × N. longifolia has been recorded from a number of locations near Payakumbuh and Sibolga, where its parent species are sympatric. It is relatively rare because N. eustachya and N. longifolia occur in markedly different habitats; the former usually grows in exposed, sunny sites, while the latter is more common in dense, shady forest. This hybrid differs from N. eustachya in having fringed lamina margins bearing short reddish-brown hairs. The peristome often has a distinctive raised section at the front, a characteristic inherited from N. longifolia. It can be distinguished from N. longifolia on the basis of its shorter tendrils and the presence of longitudinal furrows on the surface of the lamina, similar to those of N. eustachya.

The book is ultimately a digest of civilized life on the site of the Great City and one of the prime examples of a key theme in Argentine literature, first invoked by Sarmiento: the dualistic struggle between Civilization and Barbarism. The first story, \\"El hambre\\" (\\"Famine\\") shows the first European settlers starving behind a flimsy, improvised palisade, as they nervously eye the Indian bonfires in the surrounding darkness. The final tale, \\"El salón dorado\\" (\\"The Gold Drawing-room\\") has a ruined grande dame of 1904 sitting despairingly in the golden salon of her great mansion, awaiting the auctioneers, \\"like gray and black animals, like wolves and hyenas around the great bonfire\\". One need not know that there is precisely such a richly appointed \\"Salón Dorado\\" in Buenos Aires' City Hall building to understand that fate has come full circle for the failed Great City, that barbarism has triumphed, that it always does. Mujica Laínez' cool and urbane tone is slyly deceptive: his manner might be a subtly ironic homage to Octave Feuillet, but his vision is profoundly pessimistic, even chilling, in the classic Spanish desengaño school.

He played at number 8 and lock, as well as captaining the side 46 times (18 of those tests). In 1999, Lochore was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame.  Early life  Born in Masterton on 3 September 1940, Lochore was the son of Alma Joyce Lochore (née Wyeth) and James Denniston Lochore. He was first educated at Opaki Primary School and then Wairarapa College where he was a member of the 1st XV in 1956. In 1963, Lochore married Pamela Lucy Young.  Career  Lochore played domestic rugby for Masterton and Wairarapa, debuting for both in 1959. After playing six tests, including all four tests of the 1965 South African tour of New Zealand, he was selected as captain by coach Fred Allen for the Lions tour in 1966. He continued as captain until his retirement from playing in 1970 (although at the selectors request he returned to play one game in 1971 for an injury-hit All Black side). Lochore was also a Wairarapa tennis representative from 1957 to 1961 and then 1979 to 1980. His involvement in the game did not end with his playing days. He coached Masterton before moving on to coach Wairarapa-Bush in 1980. Lochore became an All Black selector in 1983 before taking the side to victory in the inaugural World Cup during his coaching tenure from 1985 to 1987. Lochore continued to be involved in All Black rugby, firstly managing the team in the 1995 World Cup, and later as one of the All Black selectors.  After retirement  Lochore was also an advocate for conservation and was Chair of the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust for eight years from 2003 to 2011, an independent charitable trust that partners with private landowners to protect natural and cultural heritage sites on their land with covenants. Lochore was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby football, in the 1970 Queen's Birthday Honours. In the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to sport and the community. The Lochore Cup, contested in New Zealand's domestic competition, the Heartland Championship, is named in his honour. On Waitangi Day (6 February) 2007, Lochore was inducted into the Order of New Zealand as an additional member; the Order of New Zealand is the country's highest honour. In his biography, Sir Colin Meads wrote: \\"at the peak of his career, from 1966 through to 1969, he was everything I would want in a number 8. He spared himself, not an ounce working away in the tight-loose, covering, winning us great lineout ball in the deep, backing and filling and playing his part in the rolling drive-and-feed. As a captain he could be self-effacing, for this was the very nature of the man\\".  Death  In June 2019, Rugby Union chief executive Steve Tew announced Lochore had been diagnosed with bowel cancer. Lochore died on 3 August that year, aged 78. Lochore's funeral was held on 8 August at Memorial Park, Masterton, with around 2,500 people attending.

Through the integration of an academic curriculum and a Reformed worldview, they provide students who desire a biblical and academic college experience with the opportunity to live life through the filter of scripture. History Kuyper College was founded in 1939 as Reformed Bible Institute. RBI had a three-year curriculum that offered a track into foreign and domestic missions. In 1970, after a five-year redesign of the curriculum and programs, the Michigan Department of Education gave the school the right to confer a four-year Bachelor degree. As a result, RBI changed its name to Reformed Bible College. On April 21, 2006, RBC once again changed its name, this time to Kuyper College after Abraham Kuyper (1837 - 1920). Kuyper was Prime Minister of The Netherlands from 1901 - 1905 and a theologian. He also played an important role in founding de Vrije Universiteit. Pre-seminary, youth ministry, and cross-cultural missions programs are part of the Bible curriculum, and social work, education, accounting, communication, business and other majors. Academics Kuyper is focused on Christian service regardless of vocation, so it not only offers ministry programs, but a range of degree programs in social work, business, communication, education, and many others all within a Reformed perspective. The student-to-faculty ratio is 11 to 1. In the 2013-2014 school year, 261 students total were enrolled at Kuyper. In 2015, there are 245 students total. Accreditation Kuyper is approved and regulated by the Board of Education of the State of Michigan. It is also accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), and the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). In addition, the college social work program is accredited with the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). The college is a member of the National Association of Christian College Admissions Personnel (NACCAP), and has endorsed that body's “Principles of Good Practice.” Kuyper holds affiliate membership within the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.

Typically quite demanding, these tests measured candidates' ability of writing composition and knowledge of the Chinese classics. The form of writing varied from literature to proposals on management of the state. Technical subjects were also tested to appoint experts on medicine, interpretation, accounting, law etc. These were the primary route for most people to achieve positions in the bureaucracy. Based on the civil service examinations of imperial China, the gwageo first arose in Unified Silla, gained importance in Goryeo, and were the centerpiece of most education in the Joseon dynasty. The tutelage provided at the hyanggyo, seowon, and Sungkyunkwan was aimed primarily at preparing students for the gwageo and their subsequent career in government service. Under Joseon law, high office was closed to those who were not children of officials of the second full rank or higher, unless the candidate had passed the gwageo. Those who passed the higher literary examination came to monopolize all of the dynasty's high positions of state.SNUERI, p. 108. Silla The first national examinations were administered in the kingdom of Silla beginning in 788, at the suggestion of Confucian scholar Choe Chiwon. However, due to Silla's entrenched bone rank system, which dictated that appointments be made on the basis of birth, these examinations did not have a strong effect on the government. Goryeo Under the Goryeo dynasty, the national examinations became more systematic and powerful than they had been under Silla. However, they remained only one among several avenues to power. A man who had reached a position of the fifth rank or higher could automatically have one son placed in a position of rank.SNUERI, pp. 63-64 The examinations were established in 958, during the reign of Gwangjong as a means of breaking the hold which a few powerful families held over the government.Lee (1984), pp. 104-105. Throughout the dynasty, they retained this character of strengthening the throne against the aristocracy. This also took the form of aligning the throne with the provincial elites, and the kings of Goryeo strove to extend educational opportunities to the local elites throughout the country. In fact, any member of the yangin freeborn class was permitted to take the examination, although the descendants of monks, criminals and cheonmin were excluded.Lee (1984), p. 118; SNUERI, p. However, over time government-run educational institutions such as the hyanggyo and Gukjagam lost ground to private institutions like the Twelve Assemblies.Lee (1984), p. 129. The major examinations were literary, and came in two forms: a composition test (jesul eop), and a test of classical knowledge (myeonggyeong eop). These tests were officially to be held every three years, but in practice it was common for them to be held at other times as well.SNUERI, p. 63 The composition test came to be viewed as more prestigious, and its successful applicants were divided into three grades. On the other hand, successful candidates on the classical examination were not ranked. In the course of the dynasty, some 6000 men passed the composition examination, while only about 450 passed the classics examination.Lee (1984), p. 118 The classics examination was revised in 1344, under the reign of Chunghye, on the model of the examination system then employed in Yuan Dynasty. The earlier system based directly on the classics was replaced with one based on Neo-Confucian interpretations of the classics.SNUERI, p. 62 Military examinations were established briefly under the reign of Yejong, and again in the reign of Gongyang just before the dynasty's fall; however, for most of the dynasty, there was no military examination and thus no educational path to military rank. This may have reflected the relative strength of the military elites during this period. Miscellaneous examinations (jabeop) were administered in various fields. One among these was Buddhism; monks who passed received a special clerical title, beginning with daeseon, or \\"monk designate.\\"Lee (1984), p. 133. Separate tests were administered for the Seon and Gyo sects, which dominated the Buddhism of the Goryeo period. Joseon Under the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), the examinations fell under three broad categories: the literary examinations (mun-gwa: 文科), military examinations (mugwa: 武科), and miscellaneous examinations (japgwa: 雜科) covering topics such as medicine, geography, astronomy, and translation. As other roads to advancement were much more closed than during the Goryeo period, the gwageo became virtually the only pathway to a position of rank.Byeon (1996), pp. 277-278. In theory, anyone other than slaves and lowest class called chunmin (those who worked in despised occupations such as butchers) could take gwageo examinations, but in reality only yangban who had the luxury of spending much of their childhood and early adulthood studying could hope to pass the exam. In the case of literary administration, children of remarried women, concubines, and officials who were dismissed for corruption were excluded from taking the exam. Gwageo examinations were very important not only for an individual but for his family because a yangban family that did not produce a government official for four generations lost their status as yangban. When writing the examination, candidates had to record the names and positions of their four great-grandfathers. The higher literary examination was restricted to those who either were already in a position of rank, or who had already passed the lower examination. The miscellaneous examinations were looked down upon by the yangban, and were generally restricted to the chungin class of hereditary technical workers. Criteria for the military examination varied, but over time it became open even to members of the lowest class (the cheonmin).Lee (1984), p. 219 The gwageo provided a basis for various forms of regionalism. Due to the strength of regional factions in Joseon Dynasty politics, scholars from out-of-favor factions often did not bother to take the examination at all. In addition, for much of the dynasty candidates from Hamgyong were forbidden to attempt the gwageo. In the late Joseon Dynasty, an increasing percentage of successful candidates came from the northern province of Pyongan, and the small county of Chŏngju came to produce more successful candidates than any other county. =Administration= The gwageo were originally administered every three years; these regular examinations were known as the singnyeonsi (식년시). However, the singnyeonsi became less important over time, and an increasing percentage of candidates took the gwageo on special occasions. These included the alseongsi (visitation examinations), which were administered when the king visited the Shrine of Confucius at the Seonggyungwan royal academy, the jeunggwangsi (augmented examinations) held during national celebrations, and the byeolsi (special examinations) held on other special occasions.These translations are taken from Lee (1984), p. 181. However, these special examinations were usually limited to the literary and military examinations. Over the course of the dynasty, a total of 581 irregular examinations were held, in comparison to 163 of the triennial singneonsi examinations. The literary and military examinations were administered in three stages: an initial qualifying test (chosi) administered in the provinces, a second examination (hoesi) conducted in the capital (in which the qualifying candidates were selected), and a third examination (jeonsi) in the presence of the king, in which the successful candidates were ranked in order. Each stage was norm-referenced, with a set number of successful applicants. The candidate who received the highest score (jangwon) in the literary examination was given a post of the 6th junior (jong) rank.Lee (1984), p. 181. If the jangwon was already employed in a position of rank, he was raised 4 levels.Byeon (1999), p. 278. The candidate with second and third highest scores were given a post of the 7th junior rank. The rest were not guaranteed a post, but had to wait until one became vacant. The miscellaneous examinations had only the first two stages; their candidates were not ranked. Testing procedures were a frequent flashpoint of controversy, with various factions vying for control of the examination criteria. In particular, the question of whether the first phase of the higher examination should be oral or written became a hot topic of debate in early Joseon. =Literary examinations= The literary examination was divided into a lower and higher examination. In turn, in the lower literary examination some candidates applied for a \\"classics licentiate\\" (or saengwon) and others for a \\"literary licentiate\\" (or jinsa). After passing these lower examinations (saengjin-gwa), they could proceed to the higher examination. This lower examination may have originated in the entrance examinations for the Gukjagam of Goryeo.SNUERI, p. 109. In the lower examination, the literary licentiate tested compositional skill in various forms of Chinese poetry and prose, including shi poetry, fu rhyming prose, piao documentary prose, and ts'e problem-essays.Lee (1984), p. 180. The classics licentiate tested knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics from an orthodox Neo-Confucian interpretation. From each regular administration of the test, a total of 100 successful candidates were selected for each licentiate. These were drawn from a pool of 600 (for each licentiate), of which 200 were chosen from the capital and 400 were apportioned from the various provinces.These figures are given by SNUERI, but Byeon (1996, p. 278) says that the total number from the provinces was 700. The higher literary examination was administered every three years, and a total of 33 successful candidates were selected from a pool of 240. These 240, in turn, were sent from the Seonggyungwan (50), the capital (40), and the Eight Provinces (the number sent from each province varied, with Hwanghae and Yeongan sending only 10 while Gyeongsang sent 30).SNUERI, p. 107 Each of the first two of the higher examination was in turn divided into three parts: in the first section, the candidates showed their understanding of the Confucian canon, in the second part they demonstrated their ability to compose in various literary forms, and in the last portion they wrote a problem-essay which was intended to show their political aptitude.SNUERI, loc. cit. Over the course of the Joseon Dynasty, a total of 14,620 men passed the literary examination. The triennial singneonsi passed roughly 41% of these; the remainder passed in the course of irregular examinations.SNUERI, p. 112. This proportion shifted over time; as the dynasty progressed, the irregular examinations became increasingly important.Lee (1984), p. This may in part have been because the number of candidates in triennial examinations was fixed, while the number in the irregular examinations was not fixed. =Military examination (Mugwa)= The military examination selected 190 candidates in the first stage, of whom 28 were allowed to pass the second stage.SNUERI, p. 110. Byeon (1996, p. 279) gives 200 for the initial stage, but agrees with 28 for the second stage. Of these, 70 came from the capital and the remainder from the various provinces, with Gyeongsang contributing 30, Chungcheong and Jeolla contributing 25, and the remaining provinces 10 candidates each. The military examinations tested a mixture of military and literary criteria. The first stage of the test was a practical test of various military skills, focused on Korean archery but the second stage, in which the successful applicants were selected, was an oral examination of applicants' knowledge of the Confucian canon and certain classics of military thought. Of importance were Sun Tzu's Art of War, as well as Hanbizi and Wuzi.SNUERI, p. 110-111. The third stage, in which the candidates were ranked, was again based on practical military skills. These include horsemanship, and mounted archery. The story of Yi Sunshin failing the Mugwa the first time due to falling off his horse during this phase, at which point he applied a hasty tourniquet using willow branches, and finishing his mounted archery portion is well known. =Miscellaneous examinations= The miscellaneous examinations, or japgwa, were divided into four parts: translation, medicine, natural science (astrology, geography, and others), and recordkeeping. These examinations were overseen by the government office which employed specialists in the field. They were closely connected to the Sahak royal technical academies, which were overseen by the same offices. In the case of translation, the languages tested were the four which the Joseon court maintained translators in: contemporary Chinese, Mongolian, Jurchen/Manchu, and Japanese. This examination was overseen by the Office of Translators, which maintained translators in the capital and in the major border-ports and cities. At the first level, 45 candidates were accepted in spoken Chinese and 4 in each of the other languages; the second level selected 13 successful applicants in Chinese and 2 in each of the other languages.SNUEI, p. 111. The medical examination selected 18 finalists, narrowed to 9 successful applicants in the second round. These were then given positions in the Bureau of Medicine, which sent some of them to the palace and others to each provincial division down to the hyeon level.SNUERI, p. 104 Those who passed the japgwa were originally given a crimson certificate, the same color obtained by those who passed the literary examination. However, pressure from the yangban eventually changed this color to white, signifying a lower level of achievement and entitling the bearer to a position of lower rank. Those who passed this examination became known as chungin. =Historical change= The gwageo were supplemented in the reign of Jungjong of Joseon (1506-1544), at the suggestion of the high official Jo Gwang-jo. The supplementary examination was called an \\"examination for the learned and the virtuous\\" (hyeollanggwa). This was an abbreviated examination, held in the presence of the king. The candidates had to be recommended by their local magistrate as men of the highest integrity.Lee (1984), p. 205. The gwageo system became increasingly corrupt in the later years of the Joseon Dynasty. Scholars who were unable to pass the examination began to form a class of disaffected yangban; notable among these was early 19th-century rebel leader Hong Gyeong-nae.Lee (1984), p. 254) Many of the later Silhak scholars also turned away from state service. The gwageo were finally abolished in the Gabo Reforms of 1894, along with legal class discrimination and the old rank system.Lee (1984), p. 291. However, the tradition continues in the form of university entrance examinations and civil service examinations in modern-day South Korea.

The conference was organized and operated by Expotech, Inc. The final (18th) MacHack conference took place on June 19–21, 2003. In 2004 the conference was renamed ADHOC (The Advanced Developers Hands On Conference). 2005 was the last year of the ADHOC conference.  History  The conference was atypical of computer conferences in many ways. Keynotes were generally delivered at midnight. The focus of the conference was less on attending sessions and more on developing \\"hacks\\": displays of programming, scripting, configuration, or other techie prowess. Hacks were presented in a raucous Friday night show and recognized at a Saturday banquet. The best-received hacks were those developed on-site during the three-day conference, and those that embodied both remarkable technical skill and utter impracticality. Hacks that were perceived as having some utility value were penalized. Rather than being held in a vibrant or popular location, the first MacHacks were held in the Holidome in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After a few years, the conference tried one year at what has become known as the MacHack from Hell. Subsequent MacHacks were held in an indistinct Holiday Inn along the Southfield Freeway in Dearborn, Michigan, adjacent to a CompUSA, a Wendy's, a Chili's, and not much else. One of the key events each year was Bash Apple,Dave Winer MacHack conference reportTidBITS Talking Back to Apple at MacHack, 13 Sep 1999Dave Feldt MacHack conference report, 1987 typically involving one or more brave souls from Apple taking feedback from the angry mob, sometimes for hours on end. Jordan Mattson was one such Apple representative, engaging so regularly and earnestly that the phrase \\"It's all Jordan's fault\\" became a mantra of MacHack. The MacHax Group held the First Annual MacHax Group Best Hack Contest at the second MacHack in 1987.1987 MacHack conference report The Hack Show generally started at midnight, and ran as late as 5AM. Prizes were awarded to many of the contestants, generally inexpensive and tangentially related to the name or nature of the hack. Unbeknownst to most of the attendees, a key goal of prize selection was to see just how outrageous items could be and still have contestants being willing to take them home. During the Dearborn years, the official and beloved hardware store and key purveyor to the contest organizers was Duke's Hardware. Winners were selected by ballot at lunch later that same day, and awards awarded at dinner. The top prize was the coveted Victor-brand rat trap modified to say \\"A-trap\\". A-trap is a reference to the Motorola 68000 A-trap exception mechanism which Apple used to great effect in the creation of Macintosh and provided the foundation for much of the hacking enjoyed by attendees.

Greenblatt. Also known as Mac Hac and The Greenblatt Chess Program, it was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mac Hack VI was the first chess program to play in human tournament conditions, the first to be granted a chess rating, and the first to win against a person in tournament play. Its name comes from Project MAC (\\"Multi-Level Access Computer\\" or \\"Machine-Aided Cognition\\") a large sponsored research program located at MIT. Over time, it became a hack in the sense of Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution,: a book by Steven Levy in which Greenblatt appears. The number VI refers to the PDP-6 machine for which it was written. Development Greenblatt was inspired to write Mac Hack upon reading MIT Artificial Intelligence Memo 41,* or a similar document describing Kotok-McCarthy, which he saw while visiting Stanford University in 1965. A good chess player, he was inspired to make improvements at MIT in 1965 and 1966. In about 2004, he had an opportunity to tell Alan Kotok that searching the 7 best moves at each of the first two plies, and limiting the search depth to 2 would have done better than the default widths of \\"4 3 2 2 1 1 1 1\\", attempting 8 plies in Kotok-McCarthy's \`REPLYS\` subroutine which generated each player's next plausible moves. Greenblatt added fifty heuristics that reflected his knowledge of chess. Mac Hack was written in MIDAS macro assembly language on the PDP-6 computer DEC donated to MIT (the first working PDP-6, serial number 2). Many versions may exist. During this period the program was compiled about two hundred times. Tournament play By the time it was published in 1969 Mac Hack had played in eighteen tournaments and hundreds of complete games. The PDP-6 became an honorary member of the Massachusetts State Chess Association and the United States Chess Federation, a requirement for playing tournaments. In 1966 the program was rated 1243 when it lost in the Massachusetts Amateur Championship. In 1967, the program played in four tournaments, winning three games, losing twelve, and drawing three. In 1967 Mac Hack VI defeated Ben Landy with a USCF rating of 1510 in game 3, tournament 2 of the Massachusetts State Championship. Greenblatt published the program with Donald E. Eastlake III and Stephen D. Crocker in MIT Artificial Intelligence Memo 174 and recorded some games there. Influence Mac Hack played by teletype, was ported to the PDP-10 and was the first computer chess program to be widely distributed. Mac Hack was the first chess computer to use a transposition table, which is a vital optimization in game tree search. Greenblatt and Tom Knight went on to advance artificial intelligence and build the Lisp machine in 1973.

Even torsion-free abelian groups are vastly more varied in their characteristics than vector spaces. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are far more amenable than those of higher rank, and a satisfactory classification exists, even though there are an uncountable number of isomorphism classes. Definition A torsion- free abelian group of rank 1 is an abelian group such that every element except the identity has infinite order, and for any two non-identity elements a and b there is a non-trivial relation between them over the integers: : n a + m b = 0 \\\\; Classification of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 For any non-identity element a in such a group and any prime number p there may or may not be another element apn such that: :p^n a_{p^n} = a\\\\; If such an element exists for every n, we say the p-root type of a is infinity, otherwise, if n is the largest non-negative integer that there is such an element, we say the p-root type of a is n . We call the sequence of p-root types of an element a for all primes the root-type of a: :T(a)=\\\\\\\\{t_2,t_3,t_5,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}\\\\;. If b is another non-identity element of the group, then there is a non-trivial relation between a and b: :n a + m b = 0\\\\; where we may take n and m to be coprime. As a consequence of this the root- type of b differs from the root-type of a only by a finite difference at a finite number of indices (corresponding to those primes which divide either n or m). We call the co-finite equivalence class of a root-type to be the set of root-types that differ from it by a finite difference at a finite number of indices. The co-finite equivalence class of the type of a non-identity element is a well-defined invariant of a torsion-free abelian group of rank 1. We call this invariant the type of a torsion-free abelian group of rank 1. If two torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have the same type they may be shown to be isomorphic. Hence there is a bijection between types of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 and their isomorphism classes, providing a complete classification. References * * Chapter VIII.

After serving in World War II as a Marine officer in the Pacific War where he was both injured and decorated, he led the United World Federalists in the years after the war. In about 1949, he began work with the CIA where he became a high-level operative, retiring in 1977. He married Mary Pinchot in 1945; the couple divorced in 1958, and she was subsequently romantically linked to President John F. Kennedy. Her 1964 murder remains both unsolved and controversial. After his retirement from intelligence work, Meyer wrote as a columnist and book author. Early life Meyer was the son of a wealthy New York family. His father, Cord Meyer Sr., was a diplomat and real estate developer; his mother, Katherine Blair Thaw, belonged to a Pennsylvania family that earned its wealth in the coal business. His grandfather, also called Cord Meyer, was a property developer and a chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee. He was educated at St. Paul's School, New Hampshire, and attended Yale University, where he was a member of the Scroll and Key society. After graduating in 1942, he joined the 22nd Marine Regiment and fought in Pacific War; he took part in the Battle of Eniwetok, and in the Battle of Guam as platoon leader, losing his left eye in a grenade attack. He became a first lieutenant and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. He shared his war experiences, writing for The Atlantic Monthly. On April 19, 1945, in New York City, he married Mary Eno Pinchot, second daughter of Amos Pinchot. He was an aide of Harold Stassen to the 1945 San Francisco United Nations Conference on International Organization, and in 1947, was elected president of the United World Federalists, the organization he helped to fund. CIA career Circa 1949, Meyer started working for the Central Intelligence Agency, joining the organization in 1951 at the invitation of Allen Dulles. At first he worked at the Office of Policy Coordination under former OSS man, Frank Wisner. In 1953, Meyer came under attack by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which claimed he was a security risk for having once stood at the same podium of a \\"notorious leftist\\", and refused to give him a security clearance. An internal CIA inquiry summarily dismissed the claims. According to Deborah Davis in her 1979 book Katharine the Great, Meyer became the \\"principal operative\\" of Operation Mockingbird, a plan to secretly influence domestic and foreign media. Meyer befriended James Angleton, who in 1954 became the CIA's counter-intelligence chief. From 1954 until 1962, Meyer led the agency's International Organizations Division. Meyer headed the Covert Action Staff of the Directorate of Plans from 1962. On 18 December 1956, Meyer's nine-year-old son, Michael, was hit by a car and killed. Meyer and his wife Mary divorced in 1958. On 12 October 1964, his former wife Mary was shot dead by an unknown assailant alongside the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Her sister and brother-in-law Benjamin C. Bradlee, later the executive editor of The Washington Post, caught Angleton breaking into Pinchot's residence. Angleton apparently was looking for Mary Meyer's diary that allegedly contained details of a love affair with John F. Kennedy, the recently assassinated U.S. President. From 1967 to 1973, Meyer was Assistant Deputy Director of Plans under Thomas Karamessines, and from 1973 to 1976 was CIA station chief in London. =Later years= He retired from the CIA in 1977. Following retirement, Meyer became a syndicated columnist and wrote several books, including an autobiography. Some insiders incorrectly suspected that Cord Meyer was Deep Throat, a key informant in the Watergate Scandal.Riebling, Mark, Wedge (2002) Touchstone Meyer died of lymphoma on March 13, 2001. Allegations of involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy After the death of former CIA agent and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt in 2007, Saint John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. In the April 5, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Saint John Hunt detailed how his father drew a diagram of the conspirators: Many presume the \\"French gunman grassy knoll\\" was Lucien Sarti, and William Harvey. The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \\"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\\", to avoid possible perjury charges. According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \\"inconclusive\\".

The novel tells the story of the abduction of a child and the terror of his experience. Plot summary Barton Royal is an overweight man in his 40s who is obsessed with boys. He lives in Los Angeles but travels out of state to find and abduct a suitable young boy so he can be his \\"father\\". When he spots 12-year-old Billy Neary in an Iowa shopping mall, he follows the boy home, abducts him late that night, and drives back to California with Billy strapped into the back of his Aerostar minivan. The narrative includes glimpses of Barton's miserable childhood, especially the physical and sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and his recollections of what he has done to other boys before Billy. Billy tries to escape and also manages to make a few telephone calls, both on the road to and from Barton's home. Barton's behaviour switches between extreme violence and interludes of self-delusion. Billy finds his way into Barton's dungeon, his \\"black room\\", and discovers the remains of many other young boys. Billy's father beats the police to Billy's location, just barely preventing Barton from torturing and killing him. Reception Critical reception for Billy was mostly positive, with the Atlanta Journal praising the novel but the Chicago Sun-Times panning it, saying Streiber failed to \\"walk the fine tricky line between fiction about monsters and monstrous fiction.\\". Entertainment Weekly gave an ambivalent review, rating it a \\"C\\" and stating that \\"For those who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they will like\\". The Dallas Morning News called the book \\"chillingly real\\", Newsday stated that Barton was \\"the most repulsive villain to appear in a popular novel in a long time\\". The Sun Sentinel also praised Billy, citing the book's realism as a highlight.

Prelude Austrian commander Guido Starhemberg The 1710 Spanish campaign opened on 15 May when the Spanish Bourbon army commanded by Philip V in person and Francisco Castillo Fajardo, Marquis of Villadarias, took the field for an attack upon the town of Balaguer.Cust, p. 114 The imperial general Guido Starhemberg, commander of the Allied forces in Catalonia, collected his army and cut the thrust by preventing the Spanish army from fording the Segre river, a success in which the officers of the British contingent had a leading role.Stanhope, p. 297 On June Philip V received reinforcements and made another attempt upon Balaguer with 20.000 infantry and 6.000 cavalry soldiers. On 27 July the Spanish army suffered a sharp defeat in the Battle of Almenara, near Balaguer. The allied troops had taken up a strong defensive position and repelled the Spanish attacks until the British commander, James Stanhope, leading the allied vanguard, broke the Spanish lines. Philip V was forced to leave Catalonia and withdraw to Saragossa, the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. The Castilian Villadarias was afterwards deprived of his rank, which Philip gave to the French general Alexandre Maître, Marquis de Bay.Cust, p. 115 On 9 August the Spanish army reached Saragossa and the Marquis de Bay positioned his troops between the river Ebro (on his left) and the Torrero heights (on his right). On 15 August, an allied cavalry-attack was successfully countered. Five days of skirmishes followed. On 19 August, the allied troops crossed the Ebro unchallenged and were allowed to deploy their army during the night. Battle James Stanhope by Sir Godfrey Kneller The allied left-wing was composed of Spanish and Dutch troops under the Count of Atalaya. The right-wing was commanded by Stanhope and was composed of British, Portuguese and Austrian troops. Starhemberg was in charge of the centre, which was mainly German, Austrian and Spanish infantry. The Allied army consisted, in all, of thirty-seven battalions and forty-three squadrons, while the Spanish-Bourbon army was composed of thirty-eight battalions and fifty-four squadrons.Stanhope, p. 308 On 20 August at 08:00 an artillery-duel started which lasted four hours. General Stanhope began the attack on the Bourbon-Spanish left wing. At first the Spanish and Walloon troops of the Bourbon army seemed to gain the advantage, having defeated a body of eight Portuguese squadrons, which they chased from the field.Stanhope, p. 310 This pursuit opened a gap in the Bourbon army lines which gave Stanhope an opportunity of piercing them. The British general put to flight the disorganized Spanish soldiers, while at the centre and the right their attacks were repulsed.Stanhope, p. 311 The battle was more or less a repeat of the Battle of Almenara. The cavalry of the Bourbon army attacked fiercely and were almost successful, but the allied troops stood firm. Then the Allies counter- attacked with their infantry and the Spanish army was pushed back. In less than three hours of battle the Allied army won a complete victory. All the artillery (20 cannons) of the Bourbon army and all their colours (73 flags) were seized. Between 5,000 or 6,000 Spanish soldiers were killed or wounded, and another 7,000 were made prisoners. The Allied losses were put as 1,500 men dead or wounded.Cust, p. 116 Aftermath Archduke Charles entered Zaragoza the next day. The defeat of the army of Philip V of Spain was severe, the way to Madrid was open. Philip V abandoned Madrid on 9 September and went to Valladolid. Archduke Charles entered a very hostile and almost empty Madrid on 28 September. Charles commented: \\"This city is a desert!\\" In the winter of 1710, Archduke Charles and the allied troops had to abandon Madrid, due to the great opposition of the people of Madrid and the dangerous strategic situation. After this, the British army suffered a defeat at the Battle of Brihuega,Frey 61–62 and the rest of the allied army was defeated at the Battle of Villaviciosa. References Sources * Kamen, Henry.

This includes leishmaniasis of the cutaneous, visceral, and mucosal types. Some combination of miltefosine, paramycin and liposomal amphotericin B, however, may be recommended due to issues with resistance. It is given by injection. Side effects are common and include loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains, headache, and feeling tired. Serious side effect may include an irregular heartbeat or pancreatitis. Sodium stibogluconate is less safe than some other options during pregnancy. It is not believed to result in any problems if used during breastfeeding. Sodium stibogluconate is in the pentavalent antimonials class of medication. Sodium stibogluconate has been studied as early as 1937 and has been in medical use since the 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, it is available from the Centers for Disease Control. Side effects Sodium stibogluconate is exceedingly toxic to veins. One of the practical problems is that after a few doses it can become exceedingly difficult to find a vein in which to inject the drug. The insertion of a PICC does not prevent the problem and can instead exacerbate it: the entire vein along the course of the PICC line can become inflamed and thrombose. Large doses of sodium stibogluconate are often administered as dilute solutions. Pancreatitis is a common deleterious effect of the drug, and the serum amylase or lipase should be monitored twice weekly; there is no need to stop treatment if the amylase remains less than four times the upper limit of normal; if the amylase rises above the cut-off, then treatment should be interrupted until the amylase falls to less than twice the upper limit of normal, whereupon treatment can be resumed. Cardiac conduction disturbances are less common, but ECG monitoring while the medicine is injected is advisable and changes quickly reverse after the drug is stopped or the infusion rate is decreased. The drug can be given intramuscularly but is exceedingly painful when given by this route. It can also be given intralesionally when treating cutaneous leishmaniasis (i.e., injected directly into the area of infected skin) and again, this is exceedingly painful and does not give results superior to intravenous administration. Sodium stibogluconate can also cause a reduced appetite, metallic taste in mouth, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, tiredness, joint pains, muscle aches, dizziness, and anaphylaxis. Dosing Sodium stibogluconate is available in the United Kingdom as Pentostam, where it is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. It is available in the United States on a named-patient basis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As dosage regimens for treating leishmaniasis have evolved, the daily dose of antimony and the duration of therapy have been progressively increased to combat unresponsiveness to therapy. In the 1980s, the use of 20 mg/kg/day (instead of 10 mg/kg/day) of antimony was recommended, but only to a maximum daily dose of 850 mg. Recent research has suggested on the basis of recent efficacy and toxicity data that this 850-mg restriction should be removed. The evidence to date, which is in their research, suggests that a regimen of 20 mg/kg/day of pentavalent antimony, without an upper limit on the daily dose, is more efficacious and is not substantially more toxic than regimens with lower daily doses. It is recommend treating all forms of leishmaniasis with a full 20 mg/kg/day of pentavalent antimony. Treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis usually lasts for 20 days and visceral and mucosal leishmaniasis for 28 days. The dose of sodium stibogluconate is by slow intravenous infusion (at least five minutes with cardiac monitoring). The injection are stopped if there is coughing or central chest pain. The chemotherapeutic index was established by Leonard Goodwin during the Second World War when a treatment was urgently required for Allied troops during the invasion of Sicily. The duration of treatment is usually 10 to 21 days and depends on the species of Leishmania and the type of infection (cutaneous or visceral). Chemical structure The chemical structure of sodium stibogluconate is somewhat ambiguous, and the structure shown above is idealized. Its solutions may contain multiple antimony compounds, although this heterogeneity may be unimportant. It has been speculated that the active species contains only a single antimony centre. Pharmacokinetics Although antimony itself is a cause of heavy metal poisoning, stibogluconate does not appear to accumulate in the body and is excreted by the kidneys. Mechanism of action The mechanism of sodium stibogluconate is poorly understood, but is thought to stem from the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis via a reduction in available ATP and GTP, likely secondary to inhibition of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. Bermann et al. studied the effects of stibogluconate on Leishmaniasis mexicana and demonstrated a 56-65% reduction in incorporation of a label into purine nucleoside triphosphates (ATP and GTP) as well as between a 34-60% increase of label incorporation into purine nucleoside mono and di phosphates (AMP, GMP, ADP, and GDP) following 4 hour exposure to stibogluconate.

The Attan began as a folk dance conducted by Pashtuns in times of war or during weddings or other celebrations (engagements, new year, and informal gatherings). A long customary in the Pashtun culture, it is now considered the national dance of Afghanistan and is popularly carried by all ethnic groups in Afghanistan.\\"attan.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 13 Oct. 2009 . Attan is a special type of dance performed by a troupe of 50 to 100 dancers who wave scarves in the air while musicians beat drums. As time has passed, the special dance has changed from a dance done by troupe dancers only to anyone who wishes to perform this dance at any celebration. Origin Attan is a traditional Pashtun dance. It is said to be one of the oldest forms of Pashtun pagan dance. Some identify attan as a religious ceremony of early Zoroastrians placing its origins as early as 2000 BCE, while others believe it is even older, going back to King Yama's celebration of Nowroz and warriors dancing and circling around the fire. It is usually performed with a Dohol, which is a double-headed barrel drum. The dance can be anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes long. There are many different regional variations of attan, the most famous being Mahsudi, Kabuli, Paktiyaya, Shenwari, Kandahari, Sistani, and Herati. During King Yama's time, attan was performed before going to war because it used to give the army the confidence that they could win the battle. As well as being the national dance of Afghanistan, attan is also a very popular part of festivals, weddings, and other forms of celebrations. Movement To the accompaniment of drums and pipes the dancers form a circle, taking each other by the hand or preparing to revolve in circles of their own. The dance starts with slow steps that gradually get faster and faster until it seems the performers must drop from exhaustion. However, the dance continues, sometimes for two or three hours at a stretch, with no breaks except a lowering of tempo or changes in the tunes and songs.Wilber, Donald N., (1962) Afghanistan, Its People, Its Society Its Culture. New Haven: Hraf Press. What the Attan Dance consists of: The dancers gather in a circle, and then is followed by music which starts slow at first, and then gradually speeds up. There is a consistent beat and rhythm, and during that specific beat is when they clap inside the circle, so the movement of the hands is outside prior to the beat. It is then followed by the dancers bringing their hands out and then clapping inside the circle, and it is the same routine and pattern of movement, which then get faster. As the movements and routine get faster, the one clap turns into two claps, and the dancers who are more advanced, at times will add turns into the movements. All in all, they must keep the circular path with the clap on the beat, every other move added is up to the individuals who originate and add their own personal style to the dance. Common dance moves involve the extending of arms into air and the stretch and extension of legs. When extending arms into air, there are times when the hands are free or there is the waving of the regalia and extension of the attire to show the detail and color. Instruments Most essential instrument of course is the Dohol (Drum). But dohols vary by sizes, for some types the size is relatively small. The reason for that could be geographic but the distinction between dohols is apparent among the various types of Attans. The Dumbak is a single-headed hand-drum found in most Arab music ensembles. The goblet-shaped body (cylindrical with a slightly narrowed waist) was traditionally made out of fired clay, and the sounding head out of goat, calf, or fish skin, stretched and glued permanently on the body. The second most important instrument is the zurna surnay, although very common, the surna is not essential with every type. Attire Attan regalia for a woman, with mirrors on the front, sleeves, and the bottom of the dress. Performers often wear traditional regalia when participating in the lively dance. Usually during the celebratory occasions, men can also be seen wearing suits and ties for a more formal look. The women can be found wearing bright, colorful dresses. These dresses can be accompanied with tiny mirrors on them which are said to symbolize light. The tiny mirrors add great detail and shine under the lights as the women move and dance. Styles and types The Attan is performed differently in many of the different parts of Afghanistan. Some styles of Attan portray themes of war while others portray celebration, especially for events such as marriage, engagements, family gatherings and also as a prelude to the arrival of spring, and the celebration of Nowroz. All different kinds of Attan are danced with the beats of the drums. However they all differ in style. The beater of the drum known as \\"Dum\\", who instantaneously change the rhythm, is circled by the performers. Below is a list of common Attan styles. * Kochai/ Kochyano - Pashtun nomadic style done in Afghanistan. Kochyano Attan literally means Attan of the Kuchi. Women usually perform this Attan during their own occasions, such as childbirth or new years (nou rooz) and coming of spring. The men usually perform with long hair, almost to shoulder length and cut straight across the back, and some may sport a very wild mustache or beard. It is usually performed with handkerchiefs, and involves many spotting movements, with multiple twists and squatting. This dance can be up to ten steps, and also involve men walking with their knees or standing erect and snapping their head in random directions to the beat of the Dhol. The depth and complexity of their Attan may be because of the wide range of valleys they trek, and many other forms may have influenced it. This dance is performed with the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers. * Logarai - From the Afghan province of Logar Logari dancers have always been known for their shyness and also for their rhythmic interruptions and spins during their local dance. Their Attan also has the trademark spins of the Logari style, using the clapping and the full twists in place, as arms are usually in the air and come together medially during the circular dance with one or two claps in the center. It is not uncommon to see one ore two circles in one. This dance typically performed by men and/or women or even young boys and/or girls. The men occasionally wear Turbans and they are taken off usually during the end of the dance when the beats get faster. The sweat on their heads from wearing the Turban, puts added weight to their hair. This dance is performed either with the beat of the musician or the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers. * Paktiawal / Khostai - Notable Attan style originating from the provinces of Paktia and Khost, Afghanistan Paktia/Khosti is typically a 5-7 step and can be longer. Because of the head movements the head is snapped left and right as their long jet black hair fling through the air, and eventually ends with the dancers turned medially and squatting with arms to their sides towards the center. This dance is performed with the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers. * Shinwari - From the Afghan province of Nangarhar. * Wardag/Wardaki - Da Wardag Attan, another famous style of Attan. Wardaki consists of body movements no clapping and many turns and twists, and Spotting, as well as handkerchiefs in their hands to accentuate their spins. The men usually boast wild mustaches, including hair that is greased as to accentuate the spotting and give more weight to the hair during turns. This dance is performed either with the beat of the musician or the musician tuning the beat the technique of the performers. In some regions of Wardak within the wardaki (wardagi) attan the leading men followed by the rest will sing a song at the start of the attan, while they are still moving at a slow pace. Later on as the pace is picked up and the attan gets faster, then they stop singing and they focus all of their energy on the (movement) attan. * Kabuli Attan is a modified Attan with modern music. In this dance, the dancers perform to the beat of the musician. This dance typically performed by men and women. It involves 2–5 steps, ending with a clap given while facing the center, after which the process is repeated again. The hip and arms are put in a sequential movement including left and right tilts, with the wrists twisting in sequence, with ultimately a hand is projected outward and brought in a 'scoop-like' fashion towards the center where the other hand meets it for a clap. This dance is typically performed with the musician dictating the duration and speed. Gender roles Tribal women performing the attan The women, colourfully clad in traditional (Firaq partug) dress, join in the dance. Often, women change into an Attan dress while the men remain in their original clothes at a wedding or gathering. In the past, musicians and singers were mostly men. Dancing by men and women together increasingly gained momentum among the educated and upper- and middle-class urban families in the 1970s and afterward. The Daoud Khan, Zahir Shah and the Communist regimes encouraged young men and women to defy traditional values and participate in these public activities.Emadi, Hafizullah.(2005) Cultures and Customs of Afghanistan.

The series was first broadcast on February 6, 2006. It can be viewed on Saturday at 10:00am and 10:17am on local CBC channels as well as ABC2 (Australia) and HBO Asia. Premise Yam Roll features a cast of animated sushi characters, and other anthropomorphic instances of Japanese cuisine, all living in Happy Kingdom, a prosperous city which is upset quite often by monsters. Quoting from March Entertainment's site: With the help of his wise Zen master, Katcho Miso (an old lump of salty bean paste), his sidekick and best friend Ebi-san (a severely hyperactive shrimp), and the rest of his motley maritime crew, Yam Roll's life is always an exciting ride. Characters * Yam Roll: A taxicab driver by profession who wears a cowboy hat and boots. He is portrayed as an orange yam wrapped in rice, his body being circular in appearance, with stick-like arms and legs. Yam Roll is bestowed with a certain degree of super powers thanks to his instructor Katcho and the powers of Mount Foopi. These powers allow him to fly, lift incredibly heavy objects, and change form (into a door, a table, a potato masher, etc.). But despite his powers, Yam Roll leads a mostly normal life. Well, as normal as life gets in Happy Kingdom. Voiced by Lee Tockar. *Ebi: Ebi-San is Yam Roll's best friend and confidant. He is a boiled shrimp, who wears a band around his \\"head\\" and sandals. Ebi is extremely enthusiastic and excitable, and always tries to force Yam Roll into some escapade or other, often with dangerous and embarrassing results. Ebi is never happy to sit still and is constantly bouncing off the walls with energy. *Edamame: Edamame Legume is another one of Yam Roll's best friends, a soybean lightly dusted with sea salt. Unlike most of the characters in Yam Roll, Edamame has no arms. Instead, he uses his two legs as arms instead. *Tamago: Poor Tamago is forced to wear a very heavy and rare omelette on his back all the time. This unfortunate impediment leaves him bitter and emotional, and he constantly complains about the strain on his back (and any other issues that happen to be plaguing him). He tags along with Yam Roll, Ebi and Edamame on their adventures, but never without his fair share of complaints. Voiced by Joe Pingue. *Minamiko: Minamiko is Yam Roll's main love interest, a spicy tuna roll who draws the eye of almost every man in Happy Kingdom. Unfortunately for Yam Roll, Minamiko is practically unaware he exists, even though he consistently saves her from the clutches of evil monsters. Her popularity nets her many dates around the city, and Yam Roll is often low on her list. Yam Roll's rival, Milk Man — a carton of milk — is usually Minamiko's main boyfriend. Voiced by Sunday Muse. *Katcho: Katcho Miso is \\"an old lump of salty miso bean paste\\" and Yam Roll's Zen master, who lives atop Mount Foopi. He often has wise teachings for his only pupil, and occasionally a good whack or two from his magic staff. But most of the time Katcho watches from a distance as Yam Roll faces his daily tribulations, preferring to observe instead of interfering. *Spicy Tuna Cone: Another boyfriend of Minamiko, Spicy Tuna Cone appears to be mayor of the Happy Kingdom, and sometimes EmCees at Hakamaryoke's Karaoke's bar. He also seems to be a minor friend of Yam Roll. *Genki: A girl who would be happy to date Yam Roll. She is kindhearted and loves stuffed animals. Yam Roll also hosts a large variety of other sushi characters, including Yam Roll's friends, enemies, and random passers-by. Each character is wittingly named after their sushi names (e.g., Ebi, which means \\"shrimp\\" in Japanese).

H. Danser, botanist) is a species of tropical pitcher plant. It is known only from the northern coast of Waigeo Island; plants from Halmahera, the largest of the Maluku Islands, are now recognised as belonging to a separate species, N. halmahera. Nepenthes danseri was formally described in 1997 by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek in their monograph \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", published in the botanical journal Blumea. However, the name N. danseri had already been in use since at least 1994.Jebb, M. 1994. NEPENTHES revision for Flora Malesiana. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, 9 September 1994. Nepenthes danseri most commonly inhabits open scrub or bare soils on ultramafic rock. Plants also occur in forest, but these do not produce pitchers, probably due to the high light requirements of this species. Nepenthes danseri has been recorded from sea level to 320 m altitude.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.

The stadium holds 5,050 people and was built in 1931. It is the home ground for the Veikkausliiga club Ilves and the Kakkonen sides TPV and Tampere United. The Ilves women's team, which plays in the Naisten liiga, also uses the stadium.  History  The stadium's history began in 1926 when the city council made a decision to build a football field in Tammela. Construction, however, advanced rather slowly due to a lack of funds. The situation worsened during the recession of the late 1920s and early 1930s. The field was opened in 1931, but a stadium-like look was reached only in 1937 when the first stand was built. The current stands were built in 1993. Only the main stand has numbered seats, 1300 in all. The attendance record for the stadium was set in October 2, 1994, when 5490 spectators watched a game between TPV and HJK.  Future  The current stadium does not meet the requirements set by Veikkausliiga, and a new one is being planned to replace it. The city of Tampere held an architecture competition in 2014, in which a proposal called Hattutemppu (Hat Trick) by JKMM Arkkitehdit was chosen as the basis for the development project. The new building will comprise apartments as well as office and retail space in addition to the stadium proper. The new stadium will seat approximately 6500 spectators and meet the UEFA Category 3 criteria.

On November 16, 2010, a live three- hour simulcast began airing on NESN at 6–10 AM Eastern time each weekday. The show combines talk of sports and politics, along with current or \\"water cooler\\" issues. The show premiered in 1997 with Callahan and former WHDH Sports Director John Dennis, and it received strong ratings until WEEI received ratings competition in 2009 with the launch of CBS Radio's sports station, WBZ-FM (98.5); ratings have since fallen from their peak. On February 21, 2013, it was reported WEEI.com columnist Kirk Minihane (PODCAST JESUS) would be joining the show as a third co-host. His addition proved to be controversial when he made comments in July 2014 deemed as sexist against Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews, and a later apology which ended with further disparaging comments against her. This caused Minihane to be handed down a further one-week suspension from WEEI, with the show ending up having an \\"unrelated\\"(fairly related) discontinuation of the NESN simulcast in September, and 21st Century Fox pulling all advertising for their film and television properties from the radio stations of WEEI parent Entercom Communications throughout the United States and a blanket refusal by Fox Sports to allow their personalities on WEEI. Program suspension On August 13, 2007, Entercom announced that the program would be suspended indefinitely until contract disputes involving both Dennis and Callahan were settled. The duo were scheduled to return to the air together that day for the first time in over three months after Callahan's long medical absence, and after a one- week vacation by Dennis. The contract dispute was believed to center around the hosts' desire to obtain a pay increase greater than what was being offered by the station, to an amount they believe better reflects the revenue the show generates. Their ratings consistently ranked No. 1 among male listeners in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic. On August 16, 2007, the Boston Globe reported that Dennis and Callahan were in negotiations to move their show to WCRB-FM, a Boston-based radio station that was considering changing its format from classical music to all sports. Just one day later, however, the Boston Globe reported that Entercom had entered into a syndication deal with Nassau Broadcasting putting WEEI programs on 11 of Nassau's New England stations. Part of the deal includes Entercom obtaining a 50 percent stake in WCRB-FM with the intent to keep the station on a classical format, thus preventing a move there by Dennis and Callahan. The show continued to air daily as the Dennis and Callahan Show with rotating guest hosts including Steve DeOssie, Dan Patrick, Bob Lobel, Jon Meterparel, Bob Halloran, Ron Borges, Greg Dickerson, John Rooke, Steve Burton, Butch Stearns, Craig Mustard, Ted Johnson and Larry Johnson. On September 10, 2007, the two returned to the air full- time informing their listeners that they had agreed to 5-year deals. According to local news reports, the contract impasse was resolved after the direct intervention of Entercom President and CEO David Field who reportedly offered the two a substantial increase, reportly in the eight-figure range.

However, he was welcomed back to the show as a guest in May 2015 to discuss Brady in the wake of his Deflategate suspension and the \\"Free Brady\\" rally at Gilette Stadium (though there is no word on whether he will return as a regular guest.) * Celtics head coach Doc Rivers every Thursday during basketball season. Controversies and issues =Boston Globe Ban= In 1999, the Boston Globe's executive sports editor, Don Skwar banned its sportswriters from the Globe from appearing on the Dennis & Callahan morning show because of its perceived lowbrow humor. This came two weeks after he banned Globe sportswriters from appearing on WEEI's afternoon The Big Show after columnist Ron Borges appeared on the show and used a racial slur to describe New York Yankees pitcher Hideki Irabu. After the ban, WEEI retaliated by banning Globe sportswriters from all WEEI programs. It was also about this time that Michael Holley, who was involved with both, chose his side and departed from the Globe to join WEEI full time. However, the show has welcomed Globe stalwart Bob Ryan as a guest host and did welcome former Globe columnist Jackie MacMullan while Ryan and Kathryn Tappen were guest hosting in order to share a story about Whitey Bulger soon after he was caught in the summer of 2011.Dennis and Callahan - July 7th, 2011 - Jackie MacMullan's Whitey Bulger Story with Bob Ryan & Kathryn Tappen WEEI.com =METCO controversy= On September 29, 2003, during a segment called 'headlines', where they read and comment about current news stories, Callahan and his morning co-host John Dennis made racist comments while discussing a story about an escaped gorilla. The gorilla had escaped from the Franklin Park Zoo and had been recaptured at a bus stop. According to newspaper articles, the exchange allegedly was: :Callahan: \\"They caught him at a bus stop, right -- he was like waiting to catch a bus out of town.\\" :Dennis: \\"Yeah, yeah -- he's a METCO gorilla.\\" :Callahan: \\"Heading out to Lexington.\\" :Dennis: \\"Exactly.\\" METCO is a state program that buses inner-city Boston students to nearby suburban schools. The racist comments compared poor, mostly African-American children to gorillas. WEEI general manager Tom Baker suspended both hosts for two days, then extended the suspension to two weeks after the Blue Cross-Blue Shield (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts) pulled $27,000 in ads and in turn donated that money to METCO. Dunkin' Donuts responded by ceasing all advertising that involved the voices of John Dennis or Gerry Callahan. Both hosts apologized and were sent to sensitivity training. WEEI also agreed to provide free advertising for the METCO program on the radio station. In November 2003, WEEI General Manager Tom Baker was replaced by Julie Kahn. Station executives denied there was a connection between the METCO incident and Baker's replacement. =Queer Eye= On June 2, 2005 Callahan, who has been accused of making homophobic comments on the air, upset some listeners during interviews with Red Sox CEO Larry Lucchino and relief pitcher Mike Timlin discussing the upcoming visit of Carson Kressley and the cast from Queer Eye at Fenway Park. Kressley and his co-hosts were scheduled to throw out the first pitch at Fenway Park on Sunday, June 5, 2005 before the Red Sox faced the Los Angeles Angels. In questioning Lucchino, Callahan asked if the team had received any complaints about \\"'fruitcakes sashaying' in front of children and families, and on a Sunday, of all days\\". In a later interview, Mike Timlin voiced his opinion that \\"homosexuals are not living correctly\\". Approached later by reporters from the Boston Globe, station manager Jason Wolfe claimed that Callahan did not object to Kressley being gay, but rather that \\"it's the openness and the flaunting of it\\". =Dennis' irate voicemail to Ryen Russillo= In September 2005, a profanity-laced audio file was posted on Barstool Sports, containing a voice mail message from John Dennis threatening rival sports radio personality Ryen Russillo (then of 1510 The Zone, later the co-host of SVP & Russillo on ESPN Radio with Scott Van Pelt and then of Russillo and Kannell on ESPN Radio with Danny Kannell) In the audio tape, Dennis accuses Russillo of being a drunk and hitting on his daughter. After the incident, the New England Patriots had Russillo removed from WBCN's post- game show with Gary Tanguay & Company. At the time WBCN, which was owned by CBS, held broadcast rights to Patriot games. Dennis denied any responsibility for the Patriots' decision. =Kevin Weeks interview= In March 2006, some listeners of the Dennis and Callahan Show were upset when they conducted an in studio interview with Kevin Weeks, a former member of Whitey Bulger's South Boston based criminal organization. Weeks had admitted to committing armed and unarmed assaults, kidnappings and being an accessory to several murders on behalf of Whitey Bulger and had played a role helping Bulger escape arrest. His appearance on the show was to promote his book, Brutal : The Untold Story of My Life Inside Whitey Bulger's Irish Mob (). Some listeners felt that it was wrong for the show to help Weeks promote his book. Callahan told the Boston Herald that they wrestled with whether to \\"put this thug on air.\\" but the bottom line, he said, \\"It's good radio.\\" =Doyle family apology= In June 2007, Dennis apologized on-air to the Doyle family of Massachusetts to avert a potential lawsuit for defaming the family on the radio. The controversy began in February 2007, when Doyle family member Patrick Doyle was sentenced to five years probation after pleading guilty to child endangerment. Doyle was present when a 9-year-old girl was repeatedly raped by two other men in the bed next to him while he had sex with two women, one of whom is the girl's mother. Doyle comes from a family that includes a serving District Court Judge, a retired District Court Judge and an Essex County Assistant District Attorney. While discussing the sentence which they believed was far too lenient, Dennis and Callahan accused members of the Doyle family of interceding on behalf of Doyle and suggested that \\"the fix was in\\". =Comments on Opie & Anthony April fools prank= On an April 1 show in 2008, both Dennis and Callahan during a top ten April fools prank list made mention to a prank done by Opie and Anthony that caused them to be fired from WAAF, a Boston radio station. The \\"prank\\" which they referred to was done because Opie & Anthony hated radio April fools pranks and felt they are only done by hack radio jocks. As a result, they made five false statements and admitted 4 of them were fake except for the fifth one in which they said the mayor had died after flipping his car on a bridge, the airborne car then went over the dividing jersey barrier and landed into the oncoming traffic lane where it was hit by a tractor trailer truck. They also said there was a hooker of African American descent in the passenger seat at the time of the accident. During the Dennis and Callahan segment, Dennis asked \\"Whatever happened to those guys?\\" Callahan then said that they were working at McDonald's with a pedophile. At the time Opie & Anthony had taken over Howard Stern's syndicated terrestrial radio spot (which was heard in basically every major city in the US), and was also broadcasting at the same time on Satellite radio. This insulted Opie & Anthony, which caused them to play the Dennis & Callahan clip on their air. This ended up bringing national attention to the Ryen Russillo voicemail situation and also caused WEEI to take very few callers during all their shows because of the massive volume of Opie & Anthony fans calling in for weeks to let the station know where Opie & Anthony currently worked. Callers would also complain about the comments and disrespect Dennis and Callahan show for a national show and would pester on air talent by swearing or pranking them causing them to dump out of many calls. =Election joke= In November 2008, the duo drew criticism from the office of Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin after they told listeners that the election had been postponed and that Democrats should cast their votes on November 5 (the day after Election Day). Galvin's spokesperson said the show was doing a disservice to voters and warned them that they could be violating a state law against interfering with elections. In response, Gerry Callahan stated \\"Obviously it was a joke and I think most listeners understood it was a joke\\". =Receiving threatening phone calls= In January 2009, a man from Cambridge, Massachusetts, was charged in relation to a series of obscene and threatening phone calls made to the station over a period of two months. The man, who was apparently upset with the on-air duo's support of Senator John McCain's presidential candidacy, allegedly called the station starting in October 2008 threatening the show's hosts as well as WEEI program director Jason Wolfe and vice president of Entercom New England Julie Kahn. The man who was charged with two counts of criminal harassment, two counts of threats to commit a crime and a single count of making annoying phone calls. In a plea bargain in February 2009, the man pleaded guilty to one of the charges against him and was sentenced to probation for a year. He must also undergo anger management counseling, perform 20 hours of community service and stay away from the victims and never call the station again. =Dennis' alcohol rehab= In April 2015, Dennis wrote in the Boston Herald that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from WEEI in order to enter rehab and address his alcoholism. Callahan and Minihane stated their support on the air, and after a successful stay of roughly a month, Dennis returned to the show sober. Other topics * The show also enjoys talking about the world of entertainment and are fans of the Farrelly Brothers. Not only did they interview them ahead of the releases of Dumb and Dumber To and the Three Stooges 2012 film, but they joined them on the Three Stooges set and Dennis even had a part as an ESPN broadcaster in Kingpin. **Other frequent entertainers who join the show include Boston-area natives Mike O'Malley and Lenny Clarke. Dennis and Callahan also appeared in the episode of O'Malley's show Survivor's Remorse entitled \\"Homebound\\" as themselves as Cam Calloway (Jessie T. Usher) joins them on air at the start of the episode. * The hosts also allow themselves to comment on the attractiveness of women they have seen or know, including Kathryn Tappen, Heidi Watney and Debbie DiMasi. * Since Minihane's arrival, the show has revived one of their old segments, \\"Headlines, Headlines, Headlines\\", led by Minihane, in which the hosts talk about news topics that are not necessarily sports-related and can be either serious or trivial. **The show now also hosts a weekly uncensored podcast called Breaking Balls after Breaking Bad where the hosts can discuss topics without a filter. * As part of the WEEI/NESN Jimmy Fund Radio Telethon, Dennis and Callahan met Avalanna Routh, the same girl with a rare brain cancer known as AT/RT who got to \\"marry\\" Justin Bieber and became great admirers of hers.

He lived and painted in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the United States. As an artist, Berninger has been described as being \\"in the outer ring of the New Hope School\\" and a member of \\"The Baum Circle,\\" the group of artists either taught by, associated with, or directly influenced by Pennsylvania impressionist painter Walter Emerson Baum. Berninger studied under Orlando Gray Wales and Arlington Nelson Lindenmuth, and was a student of Baum's first class in Allentown during the summer of 1926. In 1932, he became an art instructor at the Kline-Baum Art School. In 1934, he was one of four Baum students (along with Joseph Gehringer, Walter Mattern and Melville Stark) accepted into the Circulating Picture Club of the Philadelphia Art Alliance. In 1936, Berninger became the first curator of the Allentown Art Museum (founded by Baum the previous year), and lived with his wife, Mabel, on the museum's second floor until 1956. Mabel Berninger assisted her husband in his role as curator at the museum, and also served as secretary for the Kline-Baum School's Circulating Picture Club, a \\"lending library\\" for art. In 1939, Berninger was made a partner in Wuchter and Berninger, a jewelry store located on Hamilton Street in center-city Allentown. To promote his works, Berninger would often place them in the window of his store. It was here that local publisher and humanitarian Robert Rodale became exposed to Berninger's works. Many years later, the David E. Rodale Gallery at the Baum School of Art, named for Rodale's son, held the first major exhibition of Berninger's work. In the mid-1950s, Berninger's work appeared on a series of calendars issued by the local newspaper, The Morning Call. During this time he frequently vacationed in Bar Harbor, Maine, an area which became the subject of many of his seascape paintings. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, his home - located across the street from Allentown's picturesque West Park (near the intersection of 15th and Turner Streets) - became a frequent meeting place for local artists. Eighth Street Bridge (1933) by John E. Berninger. Now known as the Albertus L. Meyers Bridge in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this painting depicts a neighborhood on Lawrence Street that has long since been demolished. For forty years, Berninger painted with Karl Buesgen, a local impressionist landscape artist, music teacher and church organist. The two spent nearly every Saturday visiting and talking, and every Sunday afternoon painting. This relationship continued until Berninger's death in 1981. Buesgen died later that same year. Berninger also painted with Baum, Melville Stark and Clarence Dreisbach on a regular basis. In 2004, the David E. Rodale Gallery at the Baum School of Art held an exhibition of the Berninger's work. During 2004 and 2005, Berninger's work was included in the Allentown Art Museum's exhibit, \\"Allentown Impressions: Views of City Parks.\\" In 2006, Berninger's work was included in an exhibition at the David E.

Botanical history Nepenthes bellii was formally described by Katsuhiko Kondo in the November–December 1969 issue of the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club.Nepenthes bellii K.Kondo. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). The designated holotype, Kondo 11514, was collected on April 14, 1968, from a \\"[s]wimming pool between Hayangobon & Carrascar\\"Schlauer, J. Nepenthes bellii. Carnivorous Plant Database. in Surigao Province, Mindanao, at an altitude of 800 m.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1–157.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1–106. It was collected by Kondo as part of a 1968 trip to the Philippines alongside J. V. Pancho. The holotype is deposited at the herbarium of the North Carolina Botanical Garden (NCU); isotypes are held at the KC and Nagoya herbaria. Nepenthes globamphora, which is now considered to be a heterotypic synonym of N. bellii, was described by Shigeo Kurata and Masami Toyoshima in a 1972 issue of The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore. The holotype of this taxon, designated as Kurata & Toyoshima 1128, was collected on August 22, 1965, from Mount Legaspi in Surigao del Sur, Mindanao, at an elevation of 270 m. It is deposited at the herbarium of the Nippon Dental College (NDC). A very early mention of N. globamphora (at the time a nomen nudum as the taxon was undescribed) appeared in a 1966 issue (volume 36, page 15) of The Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society. The next detailed treatments of N. bellii appeared in Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek's 1997 monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", and their 2001 revision, \\"Nepenthaceae\\". In the latter publication, Cheek and Jebb noted that little ecological data was known about the species and that it was represented in herbaria by only the two type collections (Kondo 11514 and Kurata & Toyoshima 1128) at the time. Stewart McPherson's 2009 monograph, Pitcher Plants of the Old World, presented an updated description and colour habitat photographs of N. bellii. Description Nepenthes bellii is a climbing plant growing to a height of 2.5 m and occasionally even 10 m. The stem, which may be branched, often scrambles through vegetation but may also grow prostrate along the ground. It is terete or slightly angular and up to 5 mm in diameter, with internodes up to 2 cm long. Leaves are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina (leaf blade) is linear to slightly lanceolate or narrowly elliptic and measures up to 18 cm in length by 3 cm in width. Its apex is acute or obtuse, whereas the base is slightly attenuate and clasps the stem for half to three-quarters of its circumference. It is also slightly auriculate and has an oblique attachment to the stem. The laminar base may be decurrent down the stem to varying degrees or not decurrent at all. Three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib and restricted to the distal third of the lamina. Pinnate veins are abundant and run obliquely to the laminar margin. The tendrils are proportionately very long, especially those bearing lower pitchers, which may be more than 30 cm long. rosette from Dinagat with lower pitchers and a trailing climbing stem visible to the right Rosette and lower pitchers are usually cylindrical or ellipsoidal throughout, but may also be urceolate or subglobose. They are small, reaching only 9 cm in height by 5 cm in width. The basal half of the pitcher cup may be somewhat swollen, forming a slight hip around the middle. A pair of wings (≤12 mm wide) runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. These wings are densely fringed with filaments up to 9 mm long, which may be grouped in clusters of two or three (the clusters spaced up to 1.3 mm apart), but are often borne singly (particularly in young plants). The pitcher mouth ranges in shape from suborbicular to broadly ovate and is more or less straight, being only slightly oblique. The peristome is bulbous and cylindrical, subcylindrical, or flattened. It measures up to 10 mm in width, becoming broader and rising slightly towards the top. The peristome bears ribs up to 1 mm high and spaced up to 1.5 mm apart, which terminate in narrow teeth (≤3 mm long) on the inner margin on the peristome. Its outer margin may undulate slightly. The operculum or lid varies in shape from elliptic to ovate or broadly ovate. It has a rounded apex and may have a somewhat cordate base. It measures up to 4 cm in length by 3.5 cm in width. No appendages are present on the lower surface of the lid, although it bears a small number (5 or 6) of sparsely scattered nectar glands. These nectaries are transversely elliptic to circular in shape and measure 0.2–0.4 mm in length. They are unbordered, pit-like, and deep. An unbranched spur up to 9 mm long is inserted near the base of the lid. A typical lower pitcher from Dinagat Upper pitchers are infundibular throughout, being variably swollen in the upper portion. They are frequently produced, although Cheek and Jebb reported seeing a flowering specimen that lacked upper pitchers. Aerial traps are even smaller than their terrestrial counterparts and some of the smallest pitchers in the genus, reaching only 7.5 cm in height and 3 cm in width. Wings are reduced to a maximum width of only 4 mm with fringe elements up to 3 mm long, but may be absent altogether. The ventral surface between the wings or wing vestiges is usually slightly flattened. The peristome is often cylindrical and bulbous as in lower pitchers, but only up to 5 mm wide. It rises towards the rear, where it is broader. It bears ribs up to 0.5 mm high and spaced up to 1 mm apart, although in some specimens they are inconspicuous. The narrow peristome teeth are up to 1 mm long. The lid, which lacks appendages, is elliptic to ovate and up to 3 cm long by 2 cm wide. The unbranched spur reaches 7 mm in length. Nepenthes bellii has a racemose inflorescence up to 15 cm long by 1 cm wide. The peduncle itself reaches up to 9 cm in length, with a basal diameter of 1 mm. Flowers, which number up to 40 per inflorescence, are borne on one- flowered, ebracteate pedicels up to 4 mm long. Tepals are ovate and up to 2.5 mm long by 1.2 mm wide. The androphore is around 1.5 mm long. Fruits measure up to 20 mm in length. An inconspicuous indumentum of reddish or rust-coloured simple (unbranched) hairs measuring 0.1 mm in length may be present on the pitchers and inflorescence. Tepals are minutely tomentose. The stem, laminae and androphores are typically glabrous. The stem, tendrils and midribs are most commonly yellow to green, but may be tinged orange or red in some specimens; this more intense colouration seems to be associated with drought stress. The laminae are usually green, but may be orange, red, or even purple when young. These developing leaves gradually turn green with age. Plants often consist of 2 or 3 reddish leaves at the top with many green leaves below. Lower pitchers are mostly green, yellow, orange or sometimes red, with darker blotches of orange to purple. The peristome and lid may be any of the base colours of the pitcher exterior, but without blotches. The inner surface is yellow or green and may have reddish speckles. Upper pitchers are similar but often lack blotches, being a solid green, yellow, orange, or red, although reddish aerial traps occasionally do bear some darker markings. Sometimes upper pitchers may have a contrasting combination of colours in the form of a reddish pitcher body and yellow or green peristome, or vice versa. No infraspecific taxa of N. bellii have been described. Ecology Nepenthes bellii is endemic to the Philippines. It is common on Dinagat and northern Mindanao; its presence in southern Mindanao is \\"poorly documented\\" due to ongoing conflicts. As such, it is native to at least the provinces of Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. It has an altitudinal distribution of 0–800 m above sea level. The species grows terrestrially in a number of habitats, including lowland heath forest, exposed sites such as cliff faces and landslides, lower montane forest among stunted vegetation, and disturbed or recovering secondary vegetation (such as previously logged dipterocarp forest). It also often colonises the sides of roads running through the forest. McPherson, S. & T. Gronemeyer 2008. Die Nepenthesarten der Philippinen: eine Fotodokumentation. Das Taublatt 60: 34–78. The known distribution of this species appears to roughly correlate with ultramafic substrate occurrence. Nepenthes bellii is often sympatric with N. merrilliana and N. mindanaoensis. Gronemeyer, T. 2008. Nepenthes auf den Philippinen – ein Reisebericht. Das Taublatt 60: 15–27. Although N. bellii is known to form natural hybrids with both of these species, such crosses appear to be rare. Field observations of these three species suggest that they flower at different times of the year. Stewart McPherson considers the species \\"not currently threatened\\" and writes that it is \\"widespread\\" across Dinagat and northern Mindanao, where it is represented by \\"extensive stands\\". Nevertheless, habitat loss is affecting the species in lowland areas and this problem is particularly severe on Dinagat. Related species The combination of subglobular lower pitchers, densely fringed wings (often with clustered filaments) and proportionately long tendrils separate N. bellii from all other species with the possible exception of the miniature N. argentii. However, the latter species can hardly be confused with N. bellii as it does not produce a climbing stem, differs markedly in the shape of the lamina, and has a uniquely curved peristome that continues along the lower surface of the lid. Nepenthes bellii is closely allied to N. merrilliana and N. surigaoensis and shares with these species a similar morphology of the pitchers and laminae as well as a reddish colouration of the uppermost leaves. It is not easily confused with them, however, because it is much smaller in all respects, particularly in the size of its pitchers and inflorescence. More generally, N. bellii appears to fall under B. H. Danser's classical Insignes group, which also includes N. burkei, N. insignis, N. merrilliana, and N. ventricosa, among others, with N. sibuyanensis, N. barcelonae and N. aenigma being recent additions. Nepenthes bellii was also compared to N. micramphora in the formal description of the latter, in which the authors noted that the stem, laminae and inflorescence of N. micramphora match those of N. bellii \\"almost exactly\\".Heinrich, V., S.R. McPherson, T. Gronemeyer & V.B. Amoroso 2009. Nepenthes micramphora (Nepenthaceae), a new species of Nepenthes L. from southern Mindanao, Philippines. In: S.R. McPherson Pitcher Plants of the Old World. Volume 2. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 1314–1319. Indeed, prior to the description of N. micramphora in 2009, the species was misidentified as N. bellii on its native Mount Hamiguitan.Amoroso, V.B., L.D. Obsioma, J.B. Arlalejo, R.A. Aspiras, D.P. Capili, J.J.A. Polizon & E.B. Sumile 2009. Inventory and conservation of endangered, endemic and economically important flora of Hamiguitan Range, southern Philippines. Blumea 54(1–3): 71–76. Amoroso, V.B. & R.A. Aspiras 2011. Hamiguitan Range: a sanctuary for native flora. Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 18(1): 7–15. Nepenthes micramphora can be clearly distinguished by its distinct pitchers and even smaller vegetative features. In their 2001 monograph, Martin Cheek and Matthew Jebb also noted a \\"remarkable resemblance\\" between the lower pitchers of N. tomoriana and those of N. bellii. Natural hybrids Two putative natural hybrids involving N. bellii have been recorded: with N. merrilliana and N. mindanaoensis. It is commonly sympatric with these species.

Clemence Housman photographed during a suffragist demonstration. The Women's Tax Resistance League (WTRL) was from 1909 to 1918 a direct action group associated with the Women's Freedom League that used tax resistance to protest against the disenfranchisement of women during the British women's suffrage movement. Dora Montefiore proposed the formation of the league in 1897, and it was formally established on 22 October 1909. The league's activities peaked in the years before the First World War but were largely deflated in 1914 by the onset of that war, when the league membership passed a resolution to temporarily suspend their tax resistance. Members saw themselves in a tradition of British tax resistance that included John Hampden. According to one source: \\"Tax resistance proved to be the longest-lived form of militancy, and the most difficult to prosecute. More than 220 women, mostly middle-class, participated in tax resistance between 1906 and 1918, some continuing to resist through the First World War, despite a general suspension of militancy.\\"Nym Mayhall, Laura E. The Militant Suffrage Movement: Citizenship and Resistance in Britain, 1860-1930 Program League member and author Beatrice Harraden said in 1913: > The least any woman can do is to refuse to pay taxes, especially the tax on > actually earned income. This is certainly the most logical phase of the > fight for suffrage. It is a culmination of the Government's injustice and > stupidity to ask that we pay an income tax on income earned by brains, when > they are refusing to consider us eligible to vote. The league was formed > three years ago with the slogan: \\"No vote, no tax\\". It is non-partisan—an > association of constitutional and militant suffragists, recruited from > various suffrage societies for the purpose of resisting taxes.\\"Miss Harraden > Hit In Eye: She Accuses London Police of Standing By While Roughs Assailed > Her\\" The New York Times 3 May 1913 Action In several cases, the government seized and sold at auction items owned by the resisters. The League used these occasions as opportunities for demonstrations and publicity, for instance the \\"Siege of Montefiore\\" in 1906: > The house, surrounded by a wall, could be reached only through an arched > doorway, which Montefiore and her maid barred against the bailiffs. For six > weeks, Montefiore resisted payment of her taxes, addressing the frequent > crowds through the upper windows of the house. Elizabeth Wilks who was the treasurer of the league refused to pay her tax in 1908. Actually married women were not required to pay tax in Britain at that time. According to the law the joint income of a couple was added together and the husband paid the tax. However Elizabeth who earned more than her husband refused to tell her husband how much she earned. This put the authorities into a quandary as Elizabeth was not liable to pay tax and her husband said he was willing to pay the tax but he said that he had no idea how much to pay. In 1910 the authorities illegally seized some of Elizabeth's goods in an attempt to levy the tax on her income. The authorities then tried to claim the tax either from the Wilks or by her husband alone. This was legally unsatisfactory as Mark was being asked for tax on an income of about £600 per annum that he was nominally unaware of. 3,000 teachers signed a petition when Mark Wilks was placed in Brixton prison and there was a demonstration in Trafalgar Square to protest at his treatment. He was released after a fortnight to a celebrations from the supporters of the Women's Tax Resistance LeagueHilary Frances, 'Wilks , Elizabeth (1861–1956)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 Nov 2017 which included George Bernard Shaw.

Women's Tax Resistance in the United States The women's suffrage movement in the United States came to adopt some of the same techniques. Anna Howard Shaw said \\"I hold it is unfair to the women of this country to have taxation without representation, and I have urged [members of the National Woman Suffrage Association] to adopt a course of passive resistance like the Quakers instead of aggressive resistance.

Its sister channels were Carlton Food Network, Carlton World, Carlton Cinema and Carlton Select. It broadcast exclusively on ONdigital, the digital terrestrial pay-TV platform backed by Carlton and Granada, where it timeshared on channel 34 with Carlton World. The channel had limited coverage, reaching only 69% of the population via the lowest-powered terrestrial multiplex D, and newspapers and listings magazines were slow to feature the channel's programming. In the face of competition from several other dedicated children's channels in the UK market the channel ceased broadcasting at the end of January 2000 after 2 years, partly due to the limited uptake of the ONdigital platform where it was exclusively available, where the channel was replaced with Discovery Kids and Discovery Wings. The other Carlton channels closed over the next few years. Carlton Television later merged with Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc, which went on to launch another children's channel, the CITV Channel, in 2006. Programming The channel showcased children's programming from Carlton and other ITV franchisees including Granada Television, Central Television, and Yorkshire Television, short films from the BBC library, as well as programmes acquired from American and overseas distributors.

It is used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of VfL Osnabrück. The stadium currently holds 16,100 people and was opened in 1933. From the 1970s, the stadium consisted of the Grandstand (\\"South Stand\\"), two roofed terraces behind the goals (\\"East Stand\\" and \\"West Stand\\"), and an uncovered terrace opposing the grandstand (\\"North Stand\\"). On 1 April 2008, demolishing works of the very old North Stand started to make way for a modern entirely roofed stand to be built at the site. The new stand was opened in August 2008; however, there has been controversy with a local resident whose property is situated very close to the ground. For this reason, the stand could not be fully completed earlier than 2011. With the construction of the new stand, the overall stadium capacity decreased to 16,667, but seating capacity rose to 6,192. The name, which can be translated as \\"Stadium at Bremen Bridge\\", comes from a neighbouring railway bridge of the Osnabrück–Bremen railway line. In 2004, the local telecommunications company \\"Osnatel\\" bought naming rights for the stadium and it was renamed to \\"Osnatel Arena\\". As the contract expired in 2016, the stadium got back its traditional name.

The film was made immediately prior to Carpenter's theatrical hit Halloween. The film was produced by Warner Bros. and aired on NBC on November 29, 1978. Plot A woman named Leigh Michaels moves to Los Angeles, and finds a job directing live television. An older man sees her on the balcony of her new apartment, through a telescope. He enters her apartment when she's out, and begins to terrorize her with phone calls and strange gifts from a fictional company, \\"Excursions Unlimited\\". Michaels reports the harassment to the police, but because no threat has been expressed, they take no action. The gifts include a telescope, but Michaels does not understand she is being watched until the second half of the film.

Due to its unique pitcher morphology, it is considered to be one of the most spectacular Nepenthes species native to the island.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Botanical history Nepenthes jacquelineae was discovered in July 2000 by Charles Clarke and Troy Davis. The plants were found north of Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, growing at an elevation of around 1700 m. The formal description of N. jacquelineae was published in Clarke's 2001 monograph, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Two collections of plant material were made on July 13, 2000. The herbarium specimen Clarke, Davis & Tamin 1307 was designated as the holotype of N. jacquelineae. It consists of two sheets from two different plants: a portion of a climbing stem with an upper pitcher and a mature female inflorescence; and an immature rosette with lower pitchers and a male inflorescence. The isotype Clarke, Davis & Tamin 1307, collected at the same time as the holotype, consists of a single sheet with a fragment of a sterile climbing stem bearing two upper pitchers. Both specimens are deposited at the Herbarium of Andalas University (ANDA). A third specimen, Nepenthes Team NP 384, is also deposited at the herbarium. The species is named after Charles Clarke's wife, Jacqueline Clarke. Description Nepenthes jacquelineae is a climbing plant. The stem, which is usually less than 5 mm thick, grows to 5 m in length and is cylindrical-angular in cross section. Internodes are up to 10 cm long. Leaves are sessile to sub-petiolate and have a coriaceous texture. The lamina is ovate-spathulate in form and grows to 20 cm in length and 6 cm in width. Three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib together with numerous pinnate veins. Tendrils are up to 30 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers are relatively small, rarely being more than 6 cm high and 4 cm wide. They are infundibular throughout and may or may not have fringed wings. They bear a wide, flattened peristome (≤10 mm wide) which is contracted in the middle. Ribs are barely discernible, except at the front of the peristome. Terrestrial pitchers have ovate lids. Small, circular nectar glands (≤0.5 mm wide) are concentrated on the underside of the lid near its apex. Several very large raised glands (≤1 mm wide) are also present. An unbranched spur (≤5 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid. Upper pitchers are much larger, growing up to 15 cm high and 10 cm wide. Wings are reduced to ribs that run down the front of the pitcher. The greatly expanded peristome may reach 3.5 cm in width in aerial pitchers. The lid does not cover the mouth completely, being narrowly ovate. It is up to 5 cm long and 2 cm wide. The crater-like glands on the underside of the lid may be up to 1.5 mm wide. These glands are so large that they are visible as swellings on the upper surface of the lid. The spur is simple and up to 1 cm long. Pitchers range in colour from light green to dark purple throughout and may be lightly speckled. The most common form of this species has green pitchers with a red peristome. Nepenthes jacquelineae has a racemose inflorescence. In male plants, the peduncle is up to 12 cm long and the rachis up to 20 cm long, whereas in female plants the peduncle is up to 20 cm long and the rachis up to 10 cm long. The rachis bears one- or two-flowered partial peduncles. Sepals are ovate-lanceolate, up to 7 mm long, and 4 mm wide. Each male inflorescence bears approximately 100 flowers, whereas each female inflorescence bears around 60 flowers. Mature fruits are up to 2.5 cm long. The stem and leaves of N. jacquelineae are glabrous throughout. The outer surfaces of the pitchers are covered with short, white stellate hairs. Developing pitcher buds are densely covered with simple, red-brown hairs, most of which are lost as the pitcher develops, with the exception of those on the spur. Female inflorescences usually have a denser indumentum than male inflorescences. Ecology Nepenthes jacquelineae is endemic to the Barisan Mountains that line the western side of Sumatra. More specifically, it is known only from the Indonesian province of West Sumatra. It usually occurs as an epiphyte, but also grows terrestrially. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1700–2200 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The typical habitat of N. jacquelineae is dense mossy forest, which is almost constantly shrouded in fog and experiences daily rainfall. As a result, humidity levels are always high and the climate is cool. Plants are exposed to relatively low light levels, as sunlight is diffused by fog and vegetation. The species is relatively common at the type locality, although few seedlings and young plants have been observed there. This suggests that recruitment rates of this species may be low or episodic. In addition, the spectacular appearance of N. jacquelineae makes its wild populations particularly vulnerable to overcollection. Nepenthes jacquelineae is not listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In 2001, Charles Clarke unofficially evaluated its conservation status as Data Deficient based to the IUCN criteria. Carnivory An intermediate pitcher with a snail visible in the pitcher fluid Like most Nepenthes species, N. jacquelineae is primarily insectivorous, although it does occasionally catch other types of invertebrates. The pitcher fluid of N. jacquelineae is extremely viscous and coats the pitcher walls. It has been suggested that the pitchers of this species function not only as pitfall traps but also as flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid.Rice, B. 2007. Carnivorous plants with hybrid trapping strategies. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 36(1): 23–27. Indeed, this trapping method is employed by the closely related N. inermis, which also produces highly viscous pitcher fluid. Aerial pitchers of N. jacquelineae are often filled with rainwater, which, together with the pitcher fluid, occupies two-thirds to three-quarters of the traps' volume. Conversely, the much wider lids of lower pitchers prevent rainwater from entering the pitchers and diluting the fluid. Most of the plant's prey die as a result of drowning in this fluid. The peristome is often darker than the pitcher cup and it has been speculated that the pitchers of N. jacquelineae may act as light traps. The contrast between the dark peristome and lighter- coloured mouth may serve to attract flying insects. The pitchers of N. jacquelineae frequently catch large flying insects such as blattid cockroaches, bees, and moths. The wide peristome may function as a kind of landing platform for such prey. The unusually large glands on the underside of the lid produce copious amounts of nectar and likely lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth. The lower pitchers of this species are often embedded in thick Sphagnum moss, allowing them to trap small terrestrial animals such as snails. The wide peristome of N. jacquelineae distinguishes it from its closest relatives Related species Nepenthes jacquelineae is thought to be most closely related to N. flava,Wistuba, A., J. Nerz & A. Fleischmann 2007. flava, a new species of Nepenthaceae from the northern part of Sumatra. Blumea 52(1): 159–163. N. inermis, N. jamban,Lee, C.C., Hernawati & P. Akhriadi 2006. Two new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North Sumatra. Blumea 51(3): 561–568. N. talangensis, and N. tenuis. It shares with these species features such as infundibulate pitchers which are wholly glandular on their inner surfaces, bracteate inflorescences, and sessile leaves. All of these Nepenthes produce very viscous pitcher fluid. However, N. jacquelineae has a more robust growth habit and produces considerably larger pitchers than these species. The shape of the pitcher cup is closest to N. talangensis (minus the peristome), whereas the lid resembles that of N. tenuis, although it is broader throughout and contracted towards the base. N. jacquelineae can also be distinguished from N. tenuis by its ovate-spathulate leaf blade, as opposed to linear-lanceolate in the latter. The large glands on the underside of the lid are unique among Sumatran Nepenthes species, and help to distinguish N. jacquelineae from related taxa. N. jamban also possesses very large nectar glands (≤0.5 mm), but differs in having longer and one-flowered partial peduncles, and a narrower lid. Nepenthes flava can be easily distinguished from N. jacquelineae on the basis of its ovate or oblong lid and cylindrical peristome. The most characteristic feature of N. jacquelineae is its greatly expanded peristome, which can be up to 3.5 cm wide in upper pitchers. It is unusually smooth and only has significant ribs at the front where it is contracted. This is in stark contrast to the closely related N. inermis, which produces upper pitchers that lack a peristome completely. The only other species with a similarly expanded peristome is N. platychila from Borneo, although the two taxa are not otherwise related.Lee, C.C. 2002. Nepenthes platychila (Nepenthaceae), a new species of pitcher plant from Sarawak, Borneo. The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore 54: 257-261.Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Natural hybrids A putative natural hybrid between N. dubia and N. jacquelineae In the wild, N. jacquelineae often occurs sympatrically with N. izumiae. It is thus not surprising that it occasionally hybridises with this species.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Pitchers of N. izumiae × N. jacquelineae are reddish in colour and are usually dominated by characteristics of N. jacquelineae. Specimens of a putative natural cross between N. dubia and N. jacquelineae have also been recorded.Wistuba, A. N.d. Strange hybrid with Nepenthes jacquelineae? Wistuba.com.

He fired its last shot before it was sunk off the coast of France at the end of the American Civil War. He was a half-brother of James Dunwoody Bulloch, who served as a foreign agent in Great Britain on behalf of the Confederacy, in part to arrange blockade runners. Childhood Irvine Stephens Bulloch was born in Roswell, Georgia to Major James Stephens Bulloch and his second wife Martha \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. His maternal grandfather was General Daniel Stewart. The Bulloch family had moved from the Low Country to Roswell, Georgia in 1838, and he grew up in the antebellum mansion, Bulloch Hall, which his father had built at his plantation. He also had cotton mills. Among Irvine's siblings was his sister Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch. Mittie married and was the mother of future U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and paternal grandmother of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. Irvine and his elder half-brother James Dunwoody Bulloch served in the Confederate armed forces and as foreign agents for the Confederacy in the Civil War. Naval service in the Confederacy In 1861 Bulloch served as a midshipman aboard the CSS Nashville, visiting the port of Southampton in England. The Nashville returned to the Confederate States of America, and the James River Squadron, where she was renamed the Rattlesnake. Midshipman Bulloch was posted to England for foreign service and he served with distinction aboard the CSS Alabama. His nephew, President Theodore Roosevelt, later said that Irvine fired the last two shots from that vessel. After the loss of the Alabama, Bulloch returned to Liverpool. He was sent out on the Laurel in October 1864 to join the CSS Shenandoah as sailing master. Irvine navigated the Shenandoah from just off San Francisco back to Liverpool, arriving on November 6, 1865. Upon his return to Liverpool, Irvine discovered that he had been promoted to lieutenant, but had no government to serve in that capacity as the Civil War was over and the Confederacy had collapsed into history. James around 1865. Irvine is on the right. Postbellum influence and collaboration with nephew Theodore Roosevelt Denied amnesty, Irvine Bulloch remained in Liverpool after the war. He worked as a cotton merchant with his brother, who also was denied amnesty. In 1869, when his sister Mittie and the Roosevelt family toured Europe, the first port they reached was in Liverpool where a joyous reunion took place. Although T.R. at first seem to show no interest in his uncle's exploits, he was no johnny-come-lately to naval topics and history. In fact, Bulloch's nephew's childhood had been filled with stories told him by Bulloch's sister, Mittie. T.R. would write that his mother used \\"to talk to me as a little shaver about ships, ships, ships and the fighting of ships, until they sank into the depths of my soul.\\" Both uncles were denied entrance to USA, but through family influence they entered through Canada and visited their sister Martha Stewart \\"Minnie\\" Bullock Roosevelt. Filled with his mother and uncle's stories, by the time T.R. went to Harvard, he was already dreaming of writing a book on a neglected aspect of American military history, the role played by the U.S. Navy during the War of 1812. Indeed, right in the middle of classes on mathematics at Harvard, (Morris TR Vol 1, 565) T.R.'s mind would wander from his tedious course work to the accomplishments of the infant U.S. Navy, the clash of the \\"fighting tops\\". When T.R.'s father took the family on their grand tour in 1869, TR spent time with those uncles in Liverpool, their first port of call on the trip. When T.R. graduated from Harvard, he published his first book, the excellent story of the U.S. Navy's origins and actions in the War of 1812 called The Naval War of 1812, which, in part, was an outgrowth of the influence of his two Bulloch uncles and the more direct influence of Irvine's brother, James. Military service Irvine and his elder half-brother James Dunwoody Bulloch, who had served in the U.S. Navy for 14 years before joining a private shipping company, were both seafaring men. When the Southern states left the Union and the Civil War began in 1861, one of the first Union acts was to begin a strangling naval blockade on the Confederacy. With these developments, the two brothers decided to serve the southern cause. In 1861, Irvine Bulloch became a midshipman on the CSS Alabama, its construction having been arranged by James D. Bulloch and a secret purchase made by the Confederacy, to use the ship as a raider to prey upon Union shipping. Irvine fought against the U.S. government long after the surrender of General Lee. He fired the last gun on the cruiser CSS Alabama before it went down in the harbor of Cherbourg, France. Bulloch's sword is in the Merseyside Maritime Museum's collection in Liverpool, England. His nephew Theodore Roosevelt and wife Edith Carow Roosevelt saw it during their visit to the city. At the same museum, President Roosevelt spoke of his uncle with affection and high praise. Final years in Liverpool, England Irvine lived in Sydenham Avenue, Liverpool, and died at the age of 56 at Selby Tower, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Colwyn Bay, Wales. The cause of his death was Bright's Disease and cerebral hemorrhage. He was buried in Toxteth Park Cemetery in Liverpool, in a grave alongside his brother's family. In 2009 a ceremony organised by Sons of Confederate Veterans, allegedly a Neo-Confederate organisation at Toxteth Park Cemetery rededication the grave of Irvine Bulloch Theodore Roosevelt on his uncles In 1905, Theodore Roosevelt toured the South. After spending October 19 in North Carolina and skipping South Carolina, T.R. visited Roswell, Georgia, the next day. He spoke to the citizens there as his \\"neighbors and friends\\" and concluded his remarks as follows: \\"It has been my very great good fortune to have the right to claim my blood is half southern and half northern, and I would deny the right of any man here to feel a greater pride in the deeds of every southerner than I feel. Of all the children, the brothers and sisters of my mother who were born and brought up in that house on the hill there, my two uncles afterward entered the Confederate service and served with the Confederate Navy.\\" \\"One, the younger man, served on the Alabama as the youngest officer aboard her. He was captain of one of her broadside 32-pounders in her final fight, and when at the very end the Alabama was sinking and the Kearsarge passed under her stern and came up along the side that had not been engaged hitherto, my uncle, Irvine Bulloch, shifted his gun from one side to the other and fired the two last shots fired from the Alabama. James Dunwoody Bulloch was an admiral in the Confederate service.\\" \\"Men and women, don't you think I have the ancestral right to claim a proud kinship with those who showed their devotion to duty as they saw the duty, whether they wore the grey or whether they wore the blue? All Americans who are worthy the name feel an equal pride in the valor of those who fought on one side or the other, provided only that each did with all his strength and soul and mind his duty as it was given to him to see his duty.\\" In T.R.'s autobiography, he mentions his uncle Irvine: \\"My mother's two brothers, James Dunwoody Bulloch and Irvine Bulloch, came to visit us shortly after the close of the war. Both came under assumed names, as they were among the Confederates who were at that time exempted from the amnesty... My uncle Irvine Bulloch was a midshipman on the Alabama, and fired the last gun discharged from her batteries in the fight with the Kearsarge. Both of these uncles lived in Liverpool after the war. \\" See also * List of ships of the Confederate States Navy * Martha Bulloch Roosevelt * James Dunwoody Bulloch * Theodore Roosevelt * Eleanor Roosevelt References * * ;Further reading * External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20060308233715/http://www.mersey- gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.101 *http://www.civilwarcourier.com/news/view_article.asp?idcategory=9&idarticle;=261 *http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp? *http://www.bartleby.com/55/1.html Theodore Roosevelt Online Biography Category:1842 births Category:1898 deaths Category:American emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Confederate States Navy officers Category:CSS Alabama Category:Bulloch family Category:People from Roswell, Georgia Category:People of Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War ","title":"Irvine Bulloch"},{"id":"4853100","text":"The Rondanini Pietà is a marble sculpture that Michelangelo worked on from 1552 until the last days of his life, in 1564. Several sources indicate that there were actually three versions, with this one being the last. The name Rondanini refers to the fact that the sculpture stood for centuries in the courtyard at the Palazzo Rondanini in Rome.The Pietà Rondanini Retrieved 4 July 2018. Certain sources point out that biographer Giorgio Vasari had referred to this Pietà in 1550, suggesting that the first version may already have been underway at that time. The work is now in the Museum of Rondanini Pietà of Sforza Castle in Milan. This final sculpture revisited the theme of the Virgin Mary mourning over the emaciated body of the dead Christ, which he had first explored in his Pietà of 1499. Like his late series of drawings of the Crucifixion and the sculpture of the Deposition of Christ intended for his own tomb, it was produced at a time when Michelangelo's sense of his own mortality was growing. He had worked on the sculpture all day, just six days before his death.(11 September 2010), The Rondanini Pieta Retrieved 4 July 2018. The Rondanini Pietà was begun before The Deposition of Christ was completed in 1555. In his dying days, Michelangelo hacked at the marble block until only the dismembered right arm of Christ survived from the sculpture as originally conceived. The elongated Virgin and Christ are a departure from the idealised figures that exemplified the sculptor's earlier style, and have been said to bear more of a resemblance to the attenuated figures of Gothic sculpture than those of the Renaissance.Rondanini Pieta Retrieved 4 July 2018. Some also suggest that the elongated figures are reminiscent of the style used in Mannerism. It has also been suggested that the sculpture should not be considered unfinished, but a work in a continuous process of being made visible by the viewer as he or she moves around to see it from multiple angles. South African visual artist Marlene Dumas based her 2012 painting Homage to Michelangelo on the Rondanini Pietà.

He was responsible for the civil government and military defence of the Duchy of Aquitaine during the War of Saint-Sardos and the early part of the Hundred Years' War. Early life Born about 1287, he was the son and heir of Sir John Ingham (1260-1309) of Ingham, Norfolk, who had served in the wars of King Edward I against the Scots, and his wife Margery. In 1310 he not only inherited his father's lands in Norfolk, Suffolk, Wiltshire and Hampshire but was himself summoned by King Edward II for military service against Scotland. Appointed a household knight of the king, he received many royal grants including the custody of Ellesmere Castle in Shropshire, keeper for the counties of Cheshire and Flintshire, and official positions in Shropshire and Wiltshire. As a knight banneret, he served in Scotland with the king in August 1322.< Subscription or UK public library needed First term in Aquitaine In 1324 he was appointed adviser to the king's half-brother Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, who represented Edward as his lieutenant in Aquitaine. Tensions had led to the outbreak of war with France, which captured much of the ill-defended Agenais. Ingham, dispatched to Aquitaine with a force of Spanish and other mercenary troops, regained some of the losses in the Agenais and in Saintonge. After arranging a truce, the Earl of Kent departed for England in 1325 and in 1326 Ingham was appointed Seneschal of Gascony, the highest post in what remained in English possession, holding extensive powers over the law and finance of the duchy. Though he appears to have earned the confidence of many members of the Gascon nobility, an agreement with the French in 1327 led to his removal from Aquitaine. Crises in England Partly as a result of English losses in the war, the political climate at home had changed dramatically. Edward II had been deposed and replaced by his young son Edward III, under the regency of his mother Queen Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer. As the regents wanted peace, in the final treaty with France the loss of the Agenais was accepted and Ingham’s conquests there abandoned. Although he had been an associate of the Despensers, he largely escaped the retaliations that followed their fall. Becoming an adherent of Mortimer, he was summoned to parliament between June 1328 and September 1330 and was one of the not impartial judges in the trial of the conspirators who attempted to overthrow Mortimer in February 1329. In October 1330, when Mortimer was removed from power, Ingham was captured by the forces of Edward III at Nottingham and sent for trial to London. On 22 October, his lands and goods were declared forfeit. However he was pardoned on 8 December 1330, the new king acknowledging his loyal service in the past, and his property was restored to him with the important exception of grants from the crown. Second term in Aquitaine From this time on, he served the king in Aquitaine and rarely returned to England. On 29 June 1331 he was reappointed as seneschal in Aquitaine, responsible for the peace, order, and defence of the duchy at a time of deteriorating Anglo-French relations, which culminated in the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War in 1337. The defences of the duchy had been undermined by the loss of several key castles in the previous war and the loyalty of the local nobility was divided, as many owned estates on both sides of the border. By August 1336 the duchy was on a war footing again, Ingham being ordered to forbid all Gascon men-at-arms to leave the land without licence and to ensure all major strongholds were properly garrisoned, equipped, and victualled. On 24 May 1337, King Philip VI of France announced that he was confiscating Aquitaine and French commissioners were sent to take possession of the duchy. Ingham met them at Libourne and refused to surrender his territory. He then began military operations, mostly in the Agenais. Overall English strategy concentrated on attacking the north of France, with the result that Ingham in the south-west received neither troops nor funds from England and had to rely entirely on local resources. The income of the duchy depended mainly on tolls and custom dues from goods conveyed along the great rivers, but trade dried up almost entirely with the onset of war. Most of what revenue remained had to be used to support garrison commanders. As a result, Ingham’s government in the capital city of Bordeaux had very limited options over how to conduct the defence. Although losing Penne-d'Agenais, he successfully defended Bonnegarde and other strongholds and fought off a French attack on Bordeaux itself in 1339. Despite financial stringency, he retained substantial companies of Gascon nobles in his service. His services to the crown in Aquitaine were acknowledged when his and his ancestors' debts were written off. Death and burial Leaving Aquitaine in 1343, he returned to England and died, probably at Ingham, on 29 January 1344. The inquisition post mortem recorded that in Ingham he held the manor and the advowson of the church, where he was buried in a tomb that has survived. His widow died on 11 October 1350 and was buried beside him,Holy Trinity Church, InghamNorfolk Churches: Ingham the inscription, in medieval French, having been recorded as: Mounsier Oliver de Ingham gist icy et Dame Elizabeth sa compagne que luy Dieux de les almes eit mercy (Sir Oliver Ingham lies here and Dame Elizabeth his wife; may God have mercy on their souls). Family With his wife Elizabeth Zouche, daughter of William la Zouche, 1st Baron Zouche, and his wife Maud Lovell, he had four children: Oliver (died 1326), John (died 1339), Elizabeth (dead by 1344), and Joan. As three of the children died before him, his inheritance was split between his granddaughter Mary, aged eight, only child of Elizabeth and her husband John Curzon, and Joan, aged 24. Joan had married first Sir Roger Lestrange of Knockin (15 Aug 1301-29 Jul 1349), son of Sir John Lestrange and his wife Isolda Walton, and then, reportedly on 30 Nov 1350, Sir Miles Stapleton of Bedale (about 1318-4 Dec 1364 ), son of Sir Gilbert Stapleton and his wife Agnes (or Maud) FitzAlan. In June 1360 she and Miles founded a chantry at Ingham to commemorate the souls of, among others, her father and mother. She was dead by 1365, leaving as heir her son, Sir Miles Stapleton (1357-1419).

The airport is mainly used by flight schools and for general aviation. It has no terminal.  History  During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, a makeshift strip located around the current airfield, was the main operating base of the Israeli Air Force's 101 \\"First Fighter\\" Squadron between June and October 1948, and the squadron moved to it after un-assembled planes were strafed on the ground on May 30. The airfield was used as it was a bit back from the front-lines, and was clandestine since it was a purpose built strip, that was constructed after the beginning of hostilities, in between the orange orchards around Herzliya, and didn't appear on published maps. During these initial operations, the squadron operated with a few planes versus almost complete Arab theater Air supremacy and the airplanes were parked dispersed between the orange trees. The squadron was moved in October to Hatzor Airbase from the strip in due to its unsuitability in rainy conditions, probable loss of clandestine status, moving front lines which made former British bases safe for use, and a shift in the balance of air superiority towards the Israelis.Herzliya Airfield - first days, AOPA Israel, 2014-04-22Herzliya Airfield: Nostalgia, Yediot Hasharon, 2009-11-26Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center: The base that made history, Walla!, 2003-05-08 In early 2008, a new safety system was installed at the airfield.http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en- US/Rashot/Messages/SpokesMan/Spokesman_En_160308.htm Plans by the Israel Airports Authority and civil aviation managers to expand the airfield southward by 100 dunams (10 hectares) were rejected. Conversely, former Herzliya Mayor Yael German advocated for a complete shut-down of the airport, arguing that its use endangers the local residents. She proposed the land be redeveloped to accommodate the city's growing demand for residential space.http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1235898313690&pagename;=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter The airport was slated to be closed down in April 2015, but was given a six- month extension.

Seen as a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army, it was formed in County Tyrone by Liam Kelly and Phil O'Donnell in 1953. Kelly had been expelled from the IRA in October 1951 for carrying out an unauthorised raid in Derry, and took some of his colleagues with him into the new organisation.Hanley and Miller (2009), p. 11. The new group carried out armed robberies. In 1954, a political wing, Fianna Uladh, was formed. Kelly was later elected to the Seanad in 1954, due mainly to the efforts of Seán MacBride. Unusually for republican groups at the time, Saor Uladh recognised the legitimacy of the Constitution of Ireland and the Dáil Éireann. Saor Uladh were closely associated with the left republican party Clann na Poblachta – then a party in government in the Republic of Ireland, although no formal link was ever established or admitted. Saor Uladh's central political demand was the replacement of the six-county Parliament of Northern Ireland with a nine- county Dáil Uladh that would represent all of Ulster to determine the future of the \\"North of Ireland\\". The group was armed by contacts Kelly had in the United States of America, from whom they received not only guns and explosives but also anti-tank weapons.Bowyer Bell (1990), p. 318. Despite this arsenal, the group confined itself to attacks on barracks and the bombing of bridges and customs posts during its period of activity. Saor Uladh was involved in three high-profile attacks from 1955 to 1957. In 1955, they launched an attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in Rosslea, County Fermanagh in which Volunteer Connie Green was fatally injured.An Phoblacht On 11 November 1956, Saor Uladh and members of a Dublin IRA splinter group destroyed six customs posts along the border in bomb attacks.Hanley & Millar (2009), pp. 11–13. In May 1957, the group blew up the Newry Canal lock with gelignite that they had stolen.Bowyer Bell (1997), p. 316.Hanley & Millar (2009), p. 17. Their military campaign saw the destruction of several customs posts and raids on police installations. Saor Uladh had its main presence in County Tyrone and in this area the IRA was forced to tolerate the group's existence due to the popularity of Kelly.Bowyer Bell (1990), p. 255. At the beginning of the Border Campaign, the group was subsumed back into the IRA. After the attack on the Newry Canal, twelve of the group's members were interned at the Curragh Camp in 1957, where they were ostracised by the IRA internees. During the organisation's brief existence, two of its members were killed.Bowyer Bell (1990), p. 334.

French (May 16, 1919 – April 21, 2000) was an American printmaker, painter, sculptor and artistic innovator. He attended the John Herron School of Art and received his Bachelors and Masters of Fine Arts at the University of Iowa under professor and artist Mauricio Lasansky. While French studied, traveled, and exhibited nationally and internationally, he remained dedicated to his home state of Indiana, which served as a strong artistic inspiration to him. In addition to his artistic career, French was also on the faculty of DePauw University from 1948 to 1984. Following his retirement from university service, French continued to create artwork in his private studio until his death in Greencastle, Indiana. Early life Born in Terre Haute, Indiana on May 16, 1919 to parents Edgar and Radie Mae, French demonstrated his artistic abilities from an early age. For a youth with humble beginnings, art was a luxurious, even rebellious, aspiration. As a child, French was first exposed to art by Mabel Mikel Williams who taught both in Vigo County elementary schools and also private students. His interests grew as he was encouraged further at Woodrow Wilson Jr. High School by art teacher Nola E. Williams. Porcupine, Engraving, 1949 Education After high school, French attended the Indiana University John Herron School of Art on scholarship. During World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Force and was stationed in Colorado developing reconnaissance photos. While in Colorado, he had the opportunity to study watercolor with Adolf Dehn at the University of Colorado. Following World War II, French returned to John Herron School of Art on the G.I. Bill and then transferred to the University of Iowa, where he obtained his BFA in 1947 and MFA in 1948. In Iowa, French evolved under the mentorship of celebrated printmaker Mauricio Lasansky who had established one of the first printmaking MFA programs in the country. French's 1949 engraving entitled Porcupine is indicative of this training and was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in 1949. Always striving to improve his craft, French continued his education at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy and the Hobart School of Welding Technology in the 1960s. Career French was an accomplished artist who excelled in creating engravings, etchings, embossings, graphic constructions, watercolors, pastels, and metal and Plexiglas sculptures. French's 1959 etching Enchantment remains particularly illustrative of his characteristic use of etching and soft ground intaglio. Enchantment was exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1960 and received the Pennell Purchase Prize from the Library of Congress the same year. Throughout this artistic career, French was also Professor of Art at DePauw University 1948-84 where he taught printmaking and art history and was head of the art department 1970-1978. From 1963-64 he and his family lived in Florence, Italy while he attended classes at the Accademia di Belle Arti. He was also Curator of the University Art Collection 1978-1984. In 1980, French opened the Center Street Gallery behind his home near the DePauw campus where he continued his work following his retirement in 1984. Enchantment, Etching, 1959 Legacy French exhibited in national exhibitions since 1944 including 86 one-man exhibitions in the United States and Italy. His work is in over 500 collections including The Museum of Modern Art, the Library of Congress, Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bibliothèque Nationale, the Brooklyn Museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum, the New York Public Library, the Boston Public Library, Midwest Museum of American Art, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and the Syracuse University Art Galleries. Over his lifetime, French also received many grants and honors including over 58 prizes and purchase awards. Specifically, French was awarded an Eli Lily Grant for an extensive tour in Europe in 1961 and received a Ford Foundation Grant in 1969 to develop a new medium in printmaking known as graphic construction. French and his family were also avid art collectors whose collection now comprises 5 percent of the permanent collection of the Swope Art Museum in the artist's hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana. His granddaughter Adrienne French is a fine art photographer.

The film won the Grand Prize at the 7th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1996. It won the audience award at the Tromsø International Film Festival in 1996.Tromsø International Film Festival Plot After a young surveyor, Olda (Petr Forman), watches himself on television, and his colleagues Slezák (Bolek Polívka) steals his love interest Jitka (Tereza Pergnerová), he is suddenly completely without energy and ends up unconscious for three days. In hospital he meets Fišarek (Zdeněk Svěrák), a healer who is visiting his neighbour, Mikulík (Jiří Kodet). After leaving hospital he works on his energy problems with Fišarek, who shows him how to take energy from his surroundings, especially wood. When Mikulík dies, they go to inspect his body. They are interrupted by his daughter Anna (Edita Brychta), who displays antagonism towards Fišarek. Fišarek continues his tests on Olda, with some other healers. They witness a teacher on television, struggling to express himself, as Olda did. We then witness an alternate universe in which alternate versions of people on television party raucously using energy sucked from their real world counterparts. Back in the real world Olda visits Anna at work and they go for coffee together. Despite meeting a drunken Slezák in the cafe, they click, and Olda drives Anna home. They admit their feelings for each other, and progress to the bedroom to make love. However, Olda accidentally turns the television on, and his energy is again sucked from him, at which point he realises the truth. When he visits Fišarek to tell him, he meets the teacher from the television, who has reached the same conclusion. The teacher heads to the High Tatras to escape televisions, while Olda stays in Prague to be near Anna. The teacher comes into contact with a television even in the High Tatras and appeals to Fišarek for help, who joins him. The next time he is at Anna's, Olda suggests marriage, but then discovers that she has a daughter. She tells him to meet her at the opera the next day if he wants to keep seeing her. In the meantime he buys several remote controls as protection. Back at his flat he meets Jitka, who complains about Slezák and propositions him. He rejects her and goes to meet Anna at the opera (Nabucco), where he has trouble staying in his seat due to fluctuating energy levels. After the opera they drive back to Anna's, with Olda struggling to avoid televisions on the way. During a power cut that evening, Olda formulates a plan to overcome his condition by flooding the television with energy. The next day Olda collects as much energy as he can from his surroundings. In the evening Anna and Olda go to her work party, but Olda is preoccupied. Eventually he leaves to carry out his plan. He is interrupted by Slezák, who is looking for Jitka. Olda continues undeterred and on a bridge near his house, uses a stockpile of wood in his flat to overwhelm the television set with energy. When the dust settles his television alter-ego has appeared; they embrace and merge. Slezák, who had broken into Olda's flat by the time of the explosion, is arrested. The next morning Olda phones Anna to apologise and it is presumed that their relationship will proceed normally.

The specific epithet talangensis is derived from the name of Mount Talang, to which it is endemic, and the Latin ending -ensis, meaning \\"from\\". Botanical history =Early specimens= Although only recognised as a distinct species towards the end of the 20th century, N. talangensis was collected as early as 1918 by H. A. B. Bünnemeijer.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Bünnemeijer made three collections from Mount Talang during this time. The specimen series Bünnemeijer 5398 was collected on November 2, 1918, at an elevation of 2200 m. It is deposited at both Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens, and the National Herbarium of the Netherlands (L) in Leiden (formerly Herbarium Lugduno-Batavum, the State Herbarium at Leiden), with all specimens lacking floral material. Bünnemeijer also collected Bünnemeijer 5397 on the same day at an elevation of 2400 m. It is deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense and lacks floral material. N. bongso (freshly opened lower pitcher pictured) Five days later, on November 7, Bünnemeijer 5521 (or Bünnemeijer 2552) was collected from 2500 m on Mount Talang. It is deposited at both Herbarium Bogoriense (male and female floral material) and the National Herbarium of the Netherlands (female floral material; sheet H.L.B. 822.60.920). Bünnemeijer made a fourth collection of N. talangensis from Bukit Gombak on November 16, 1918, at an elevation of 2330 m. This specimen, designated as Bünnemeijer 5748 bis (or Bünnemeijer 6740), is held at Herbarium Bogoriense and lacks floral material. It was collected on the same day as some of the earliest known specimens of N. inermis. =Taxonomic confusion and formal description= Nepenthes talangensis has been confused with N. bongso on a number of occasions. In his seminal 1928 monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", B. H. Danser treated specimens of N. bongso, N. ovata, and N. talangensis all under N. bongso. Shigeo Kurata did the same in an article published in a 1973 issue of The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore. Two early colour photographs of N. talangensis were published by Mike Hopkins, Ricky Maulder, and Bruce Salmon, in a 1990 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, where the species was again confused with, and identified as, N. bongso. Joachim Nerz conducted field studies of N. talangensis on Mount Talang in 1986 and made three collections of the species: Nerz 2501 consists of a short climbing stem with pitchers and floral material; Nerz 2502 includes leaves and pitchers of the climbing stem and is preserved in alcohol; and Nerz 2503 comprises leaves and pitchers of the rosette. All three specimens were collected on September 6, 1986, from an elevation of 2200 m, and are deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands (L) in Leiden. Nerz's field studies, coupled with observations of N. bongso made by Mr. and Mrs. DeWitte on Mount Singgalang in 1993, showed that the two taxa almost certainly represented distinct species. To confirm this and prepare a formal description, Nerz and Andreas Wistuba examined herbarium specimens of both taxa, including Bünnemeijer 5398, 5521, and 5748 bis, as well as material of N. bongso from Mount Merapi (Korthals s.n., the type specimen) and Mount Singgalang (Beccari 268). This research culminated in the formal description of N. talangensis by Nerz and Wistuba in the December 1994 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter.Nepenthes talangensis J.Nerz & Wistuba. International Plant Names Index (IPNI).Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes talangensis. Carnivorous Plant Database. The authors designated Nerz 2501 as the holotype. Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek synonymised N. talangensis with N. bongso in their 1997 monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\". The authors retained N. talangensis as a probable synonym of N. bongso in their 2001 revision, \\"Nepenthaceae\\", writing: > Each mountain peak in C Sumatra appears to support a slight variant of N. > bongso, and we have adopted a rather broad definition of the species. > Specimens from Mt Talang have been distinguished as N. talangensis, which > may well merit recognition on the basis of photographs we have seen. > However, we have not yet viewed the type specimens and for the meantime are > leaving it as a synonym of N. bongso. Nerz and Wistuba disagreed with this synonymisation. Charles Clarke elevated N. talangensis to a species once again in his 2001 book, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. The next detailed treatment of N. talangensis appeared in Stewart McPherson's 2009 monograph, Pitcher Plants of the Old World, which retained it as a separate species. Despite the taxonomic confusion that has surrounded N. bongso and N. talangensis, these two species are easily distinguished by their pitchers, which are quite dissimilar. =Discovery of tetraploids= The discovery of a new population of apparently tetraploid N. talangensis was reported by Kazuhisa Mio in the July 2006 issue of the Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society.

The following year, the same authors published a study on the effect of fertilisation on photosynthetic efficiency in prey-deprived N. talangensis.Pavlovič, A., L. Singerová, V. Demko, J.

Description Nepenthes talangensis is a climbing plant growing to a height of 3 m. The stem is up to 0.5 cm in diameter and has internodes up to 10 cm long that are cylindrical-angular in cross section. The stem may be branched and is yellowish-green in colour. Leaves are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina (leaf blade) varies in shape and may be linear, lanceolate, or slightly spathulate. It measures up to 16 cm in length by 3 cm in width. The lamina has an acute or obtuse apex and an attenuate base that clasps the stem. Two to three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are irregularly reticulate. Tendrils are up to 30 cm long. The lamina is dark green throughout, whereas the midrib and tendril are yellowish-green like the stem. Rosette and lower pitchers are only produced briefly before the plant starts to climb. They are either entirely ovate or only ovate in the upper half and infundibular below. They often narrow just below the peristome. Terrestrial pitchers grow to 10 cm in height by 6 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (≤10 mm wide) usually runs down the ventral surface of the trap, bearing filaments up to 8 mm long, although these wings may be absent altogether or only extend for a portion of the trap's length. The pitcher mouth is round and positioned horizontally in the front two-thirds, rising at the rear to form a short neck. The peristome is flattened, strongly incurved, and measures up to 15 mm in width. It bears ribs up to 0.8 mm high and spaced up to 1 mm apart. These ribs terminate in distinct teeth (≤3 mm long) on the inner margin of the peristome. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 78% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90–102. The peristome forms a short neck at the rear, where the teeth form two parallel rows. The inner surface is wholly glandular; there is no waxy zone. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate to elliptic and has a cordate base. It measures up to 6 cm in length by 5 cm in width. It bears no appendages on its lower surface. A flattened spur measuring up to 5 mm in length is inserted near the base of the lid. It may or may not be branched. Lower pitchers are typically light yellow to olive green and speckled with red or purple. The inner surface is a light shade of yellow. The peristome is generally yellow or orange in freshly opened traps, later becoming dark red to purple as the pitcher matures. The upper surface of the lid is often yellow with orange to purple blotches, whereas the underside may be completely red, although this is not always the case. Upper pitchers are either narrowly infundibular in the basal half of the pitcher cup and swollen above or infundibular throughout. A constriction is present just below the peristome. Aerial traps reach 12 cm in height by 6 cm in width. In upper pitchers, the wings may be partially developed near the pitcher mouth, or they may be reduced to ribs. The peristome reaches up to 24 mm in width and is similarly incurved to that found in terrestrial traps. Other parts of upper pitchers are similar to their lower counterparts. Upper pitchers exhibit a similar pigmentation to lower pitchers, but are typically lighter. Nepenthes talangensis has a racemose inflorescence up to 14 cm long, of which the peduncle constitutes up to 5 cm and the rachis up to 9 cm. The peduncle has a basal diameter of 2 mm. Flowers are borne solitarily on pedicels (≤10 mm long) with simple bracts. Tepals are elliptic and up to 4 mm long. Female and male inflorescences have a similar structure. A sparse but persistent indumentum of simple, white hairs is present on most parts of the plant. The density of hairs on the pitchers may be so low that they appear glabrous. The laminar margins are lined with red, brown or white hairs measuring up to 3 mm. Nepenthes talangensis varies little across its restricted range and has no infraspecific taxa. Ecology Nepenthes talangensis growing in mossy upper montane forest Nepenthes talangensis is thought to be endemic to the area around Mount Talang in the Indonesian province of West Sumatra; it has been recorded from Mount Talang itself and from nearby Bukit Gombak. A population of apparently tetraploid plants is known. Although Nerz and Wistuba wrote in their formal description that N. talangensis is restricted to elevations above 2200 m, the species is now known to have a wider altitudinal distribution of 1800–2500 m.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The typical habitat of N. talangensis is mossy upper montane forest, where it is almost exclusively terrestrial, but rarely may also be found as an epiphyte. It may grow in shady conditions under dense tree cover or among open, stunted shrubs where it is exposed to strong or even direct sunlight. At lower elevations of as little as 1800 m, N. talangensis is found in dense mossy forest, where it is sympatric with N. gymnamphora and N. inermis. Nepenthes talangensis is seldom sympatric with N. bongso, despite the latter being common on Mount Talang. This is because the two species occupy distinct ecological niches; N. bongso is typically an epiphyte in lower montane forest, whereas N. talangensis usually grows terrestrially in upper montane forest. Natural hybrids with all three sympatric Nepenthes species have been recorded. The conservation status of N. talangensis is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, based on an assessment carried out in 2000. This agrees with an informal assessment made by Charles Clarke in 2001, who also classified the species as Endangered based on the IUCN criteria. Since the species appears to be restricted to a single mountain, it would normally fall under the category of Critically Endangered. Stewart McPherson considered the species \\"not seriously threatened\\" in his 2009 monograph, describing extant wild populations as \\"extensive\\". A substantial number of plants persist on Mount Talang despite its recent volcanic activity, which has included large eruptions. Due to its status as an active volcano, Mount Talang receives few visitors and is not a major target for development. Carnivory Nepenthes talangensis produces extremely thick, mucilaginous pitcher liquid, which coats the entire inner surfaces of the traps in a thin film. The pitchers of this species appear to function at least in part as flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid. Similarly viscous pitcher fluid is also found in seven other closely allied Sumatran species: N. aristolochioides, N. dubia, N. flava, N. inermis, N. jacquelineae, N. jamban, and N. tenuis. Together with N. talangensis, these species all share infundibular pitchers that are wholly glandular or almost so. Related species Nepenthes talangensis has a greatly incurved peristome that extends for only a few millimetres on the outside of the pitcher Despite being confused with N. bongso throughout much of its botanical history, N. talangensis is clearly distinct from this species and can easily be distinguished on the basis of its greatly incurved peristome and smaller laminae with hair-fringed margins. In addition, the lower pitchers of N. bongso have a cylindrical upper portion that is non-glandular, whereas the lower traps of N. talangensis lack this cylindrical section and are wholly glandular. Furthermore, the laminar apex is acute to obtuse in N. talangensis and has a simple tendril insertion; N. bongso has a rounded apex, typically with a sub-apical tendril insertion. The funnel-shaped upper pitchers of N. talangensis may also be reminiscent of species such as N. eymae, N. flava, N. inermis, N. pitopangii, and N. tenuis. However, N. talangensis differs from all of these in its combination of a wide lid without appendages and a greatly incurved peristome bearing conspicuous ribs and teeth. The pitchers of N. talangensis may also resemble those of N. jamban, but are not as broad around the mouth and have a much wider lid. Nepenthes aristolochioides is thought to be the closest relative of N. talangensis and these two species share a very similar lamina structure. However, they are easily separated by their pitchers; those of N. aristolochioides are uniquely dome-shaped and have an almost vertical pitcher opening. In their formal description of N. talangensis, Nerz and Wistuba compared it with N. bongso, N. dubia, and N. tenuis. The authors distinguished it from these species on the basis of the shape of the upper pitchers, the lid, and the length/width ratio of the upper pitchers. The ratio was given as 2.3 for N.talangensis; greater than that of N. tenuis (1.75) and N. dubia (1.9), but much lower than that of N. bongso (3.3). Natural hybrids Three natural hybrids involving N. talangensis have been recorded: with N. bongso, N. gymnamphora, and N. inermis.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. =Nepenthes × pyriformis= An upper pitcher of N. × pyriformis Nepenthes inermis is known to hybridise with N. talangensis on the upper slopes of Mount Talang, where the two species grow sympatrically. Since N. talangensis was only described as a distinct species in 1994, some of the older literature identifies this hybrid as N. bongso × N. inermis. This natural hybrid is similar to N. dubia, but can be distinguished on the basis of several stable characters. The hybrid has a wider pitcher lid that is never relfexed beyond 90 degrees and the pitcher cup is not appressed in the lower parts as in N. dubia. In addition, the mouth of N. inermis × N. talangensis is raised towards the back as opposed to being horizontal. Nepenthes inermis × N. talangensis has been the subject of taxonomic confusion in the past. In a 1973 article on the Nepenthes of Borneo, Singapore, and Sumatra, Shigeo Kurata incorrectly identified specimens of this hybrid as belonging to N. dubia. In 1997, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek published their monograph \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", in which they referred to N. dubia plant material from Mount Talang (Kurata s.n. SING). Charles Clarke later identified Kurata s.n. as representing N. inermis × N. talangensis. In 2001, Kurata described this hybrid as a new species, N. pyriformis. Kurata, S. 2001. スマトラ島およびミンダナオ島産ウツボカズラの２新種(英文). [Two new species of Nepenthes from Sumatra (Indonesia) and Mindanao (Philippines).] Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society 52(2): 30–34. Clarke rejected this interpretation in his monograph, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, published the same year. Clarke found that the type specimen of N. pyriformis, Kurata & Mikil 4230 NDC, matches the appearance of N. inermis × N. talangensis \\"in most respects\\".

Easter Cultmalindie is a small hamlet or \\"fermtoun\\" in Tibbermore parish, Perthshire, Scotland. The Bruces of Cultmalindie were a minor branch of the Bruce family in Scotland, and were descendants of Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland (1306-1329). Laurence Bruce was the half brother of Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney. Earl Robert was the recognized illegitimate son of James V, King of Scotland, and Eupheme Elphinstone. About 1571 Laurence Bruce was appointed sheriff (the anglicised equivalent to the actual Norn-Scottish title of Foud or \\"faud\\", coming from the Norse term 'fogde', meaning approximately bailiff) of the Shetland Islands by Earl Robert. Accompanied by his nephew William Bruce of Crail (son of his full-brother Robert Bruce: although he may have been a son of Laurence) and other officials and armed men, Laurence Bruce moved to his new domain and set up his seat on the island of Unst. Once there he rapidly became unpopular due to his oppressive and corrupt rule. For example, it was alleged that he took bribes and that he had altered the official weights and measures to enhance the revenues of Earl Robert. His armed men felt free to seize control of ships and to billet themselves in the homes of the local people. Evidently Laurence Bruce helped himself to the local women, and is believed to have fathered approximately twenty-four illegitimate children beyond his ten legitimate children by his wives Helen Kennedy and Elizabeth Gray. Escalating conflict with the local Shetland Islanders resulted in a petition being sent to the royal court in Edinburgh. In response, a royal commission, the 'Mudy commission', travelled to Shetland and in February 1577 took evidence from 700 male Shetlanders. As a result, Laurence Bruce was removed from office. But by June of the following year, he had returned to the islands as \\"sheriff-depute\\". Laurence Bruce is best known as the builder of Muness Castle, which was completed around 1598. Muness Castle, now a ruin, is the most northerly castle in Great Britain. It was built at the southeast end of Unst, just east of the town of Uyeasound, after Earl Robert was succeeded by his son Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney in 1593. Later events proved that Laurence Bruce had good reason to fear the aggression of Earl Patrick. In 1608 Earl Patrick sent a force to besiege the castle, but the attackers abandoned their assault. In 1610 Laurence Bruce testified against Earl Patrick before the Privy Council in Edinburgh. Following a rebellion in Orkney, in August 1614 the Privy Council appointed Laurence Bruce a Commissioner and charged him with apprehending any rebels who might seek shelter in Shetland. Laurence Bruce died at Muness castle in August 1617 and was buried inside the old church at nearby Sandwick. Ownership of the castle passed to his second eldest son Andrew Bruce of Muness, a quieter and more popular man than his father. Laurence Bruce's eldest son, Alexander Bruce of Cultmalindie, returned to the mainland of Scotland to run the family's property in Perthshire. Illegitimate sons include Scipio Bruce of Meikleure. William Bruce of Symbister, his nephew (possible son) married Marjorie Stewart, a daughter of John Stewart (an illegitimate son of James V) and Jean Hepburn.

The school was founded in July 1990 by Indian born Omani businessman P Mohamed Ali,Dr P Mohamed Ali the managing director of Galfar Engineering and Contracting. Mr. B S Bhatnagar was the principal of the school from 1991 to spring 2006. The present principal is Mrs. Papri Ghosh, who succeeded Mr. G. Thangadurai in 2008. The current vice principal of the school is G. Sreekumar who took over in 2007.  Academics  ISG is a co-educational private grammar school which is under the Central Board of Secondary Education of India. The school offers complete educational services starting from Kindergarten through to the 12th grade senior school in line with the grammar curriculum and syllabus prescribed by the CBSE, renowned world over for its rigorous and meticulously thorough educational standards. The 11th and 12th standard students can choose from two streams of specialisations namely Science and Commerce. The subjects include:Science Stream-Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Computer Science/Economics/Engineering Graphics, Mathematics/Informatics Practices(IP) Commerce Stream-Accountancy, Business Studies, Computer Science/Economics, Mathematics/Informatics Practices(IP). IP has been recent additions to the subject list. The school also offers an array of languages such as Malayalam, French, Arabic, Sanskrit and Hindi as the Second and Third Languages from grade 6 onward till grade 10. =CBSE Nationals= The school takes part in the CBSE national level tournaments in most of the sports. Events they participate in include Athletics, Badminton, Chess, Cricket, Football, Swimming, Table-Tennis etc.  Student Council  The School Council members are elected democratically by the students of each class. The Student Council has two members from each class, a Boy and a Girl, starting from Grade 6. The office bearers of the Student Council are the Speaker, the Vice President and the President are all elected from the final year students. Prefectorial body The prefects are also elected by the students in a democratic way. Every year, the office bearers are the President of Student Council, Headboy, Headgirl,Vice President of Student Council, Vice Headboy, Vice Headgirl, Speaker of Student Council, President of the Round Square, Sports Captain(Girls), Sports Captain(Boys). There is also a body of prefects, whose number vary around 16. The prefects also have to pay extra when contributing towards any event. Houses The students of the school are organised in four houses, which compete against each other in intra-school tournaments, which include sporting and quizzing. The houses are named after significantly famous places in Oman. The houses are Muscat House, Nizwa House, Sohar House, and Sur House. =History= Originally 8 houses competed for the House of the Year award. However, the 4 of the 8 houses have ceased to exist. The houses in alphabetical order preceded by their respective colours are as follows: * Muscat * Nizwa * Sohar * Sur =House structure and governance= A 'House' comprises a quarter of the Senior Student population and a quarter of the Teaching Staff. 'Senior student' is the educational establishment collective term given for the students enrolled in Grade 6 and upwards until Grade 12. The house hierarchy is as follows (in descending order): *Head House Master and Head House Mistress *House Masters and House Mistresses *Male House Captain and Female House Captain *Team Captains for the respective teams *House Members House Masters and House Mistresses Each 'House' is governed by the respective Senior Head Housemaster and Head Housemistress, with the individual specialist tasks (such as Debates, Quizzes etc.) often delegated to the Vice Housemaster(s) and Vice Housemistress(es) mutually acknowledged to be the most in experienced in the concerned field. As of now they are giving a chance to all the teachers in the school every year to learn to be a responsible and experienced teacher in all the fields. House Captain A House Captain, or the Student Head, is often democratically elected by the most senior students and subjective to discretionary approval by the respective Heads of the House. A House Captain is often seen as the person responsible for leading the House up the points table, thereby ensuring that the House procures a strong position and establishes itself as an Award Winner. House Team Captain The respective teams elect their Team Captain. For instance, the members of the Football Team elect their Football Team Captain. The Team Captain has complete freedom to conduct and lead his or her team in any manner he or she wishes, so long as it is in the spirit of healthy competition and in the interests of the House.  House members The house membership is strictly reserved for 'Senior Students' (students in Grade 6 and above). All students are expected to take part in an event of their choice, although this is not mandatory. Nevertheless, extending support to their houses in times of competition is greatly recognised and immensely appreciated by all the teams. =Student support= Every student within the House are assigned an Academic Tutor who will be responsible for the student's academic performance, extracurricular achievements and all other issues of concern that would generally benefit the student's welfare both on-campus and off-campus, thereby ensuring a great educational experience during their stay at school. But this is only done twice in a month. As they go to higher standards the teachers minimise to once in a month. So that the students get more time to study. This system, however is inactive and exists only on public platforms like Wikipedia, in order to improve the image of the school. =Selection criteria= The selection criteria for the choice of the heads of the houses are based on seniority. The selection criteria for the Junior Head Masters and Mistresses is almost always based on the individual's skills and experience within a particular field. For Example: Language Teachers within a particular House usually take on the roles of coaching the Language Debate House Team.  Assembly  The assemblies are usually conducted every day of the week except Wednesdays because Inspection takes place on that day. Each week, 1 class is assigned the task of conducting it and at the end, the principal speaks about the values and the major events / important values / special guests arriving or anything that needs to be changed or anything that has to take place. Department of Information Technology (DoIT) ISG was one of the first schools to incorporate an independent IT department, called the Department of Information Technology or also known as IT department . This allows the school to augment the students existing syllabus with computer education. The department has 164 workstations which are spread over 3 labs. The department is also responsible for maintaining the school's website.  School Song and Motto  The school song was written and composed by Denzel. A.V.Prince.  Quiz teams  The school has produced teams that have won national and international quiz competitions. In 1998, the school won the Times of Oman Quiz and went on to win the All-Asia Bournvita Quiz Contest held in India. The school conducts general knowledge quizzes every month to raise the awareness of world affairs among students. The School has won the Times Of Oman Inter school Quiz the most number of times, and has held the rolling trophy for a record three years and running.

The Public Broadcasting Council also partners with the City of Rochester to operate and program named City12, a Government-access television (GATV) cable channel which airs Public-access television programming and live City Council meetings on a 15-hour daily schedule.  History  It was first formed in 1958 by local educators and community leaders as the Rochester Area Educational Television Association to produce and provide Educational television programming to be seen on the city's commercial broadcasting television stations. During the early 1960s the organization raised funds to build its own independent signal which would furnish daily educational, cultural, and informational programming during both school hours and prime-time evening hours for an all-ages family audience. WXXI-TV signed on in September 1966, from studios in the former East High School building in Rochester. Those facilities eventually proved unable to accommodate the station's growth in audience and local programming, and could not provide room for a planned FM non-commercial Community radio sister station, so WXXI built a new Public Broadcasting Center and opened it in December 1974. It was at that time, that companion station WXXI-FM was opened and became the Rochester community's first full-market-coverage Non-commercial educational and cultural radio station. Demand for full-time Non-commercial radio service in both classical/fine arts and news/talk formats grew beyond the ability of one signal to serve. So in 1984, Rochester AM station WSAY was acquired and became WXXI (AM), a regional service with a signal capable of reaching the six-county Rochester metropolitan region. It opened its news/talk service with local and NPR programming on July 2 of that year. WXXI-FM then became a 24-hour classical and fine arts station. Each station has since built a substantial and growing audience. The WXXI-FM facility now includes not only analog FM service and the Reachout Radio subcarrier service for the blind and visually impaired, but full-market digital coverage on both HD-1 and HD-2 channels, the latter of which simulcasts WXXI-AM in digital stereo. Later on, WXXI joined in partnership with the University of Rochester to operate WRUR-FM as a service with both news and adult alternative music and specialty programming, and took control of WXXY (FM) in Houghton, New York, in the Southern Tier region to provide a mix of classical and news programming for a portion of the state which had previously been outside the range of a public signal. WXXI joined in partnership with Hobart and William Smith Colleges (operators of National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate WEOS (FM) in Geneva, New York) to provide an alternative non-commercial service for the southern Finger Lakes region: WITH (FM) in Ithaca opened during the spring of 2010. WXXI-TV, meanwhile, continued to grow. The Public Broadcasting Center more than doubled in size in 1991, adding additional radio studios and three fully equipped TV production studios. It built a new digital full-service television transmitter capable of simultaneously transmitting four programming streams—the main WXXI- TV public signal in high definition, plus the Public Broadcasting Service PBS World programming schedule and the Create schedule emphasizing and the arts instructional and how-to programming and the PBS Kids schedule children's programming, all of which air 24 hours daily, plus a special training channel serving regional public safety agencies with professional Instructional television programming. In 2012, WXXI announced a long term affiliation with the Little Theatre where WXXI took over operations of the venue. In December 2018, it was announced that WXXI via a for-profit arm was acquiring the main Rochester alternative weekly newspaper City Newspaper from its founders who were going into retirement.

This picaresque Bildungsroman presents, a rich and highly amusing series of pictures from the boy's Seville childhood in the 1570s to the old man's death in early colonial Argentina in the 1650s.

Biography The 13th Duchess of Alba, c. 1805 María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva became the 13th Duchess of Alba in 1776 after inheriting the title from her paternal grandfather, Fernando de Silva, 12th Duke of Alba, who outlived her father. Her marriage the year before to José Álvarez de Toledo Osorio, 11th Marquess of Villafranca (a male-line descendant of Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 2nd Duke of Alba), made her and her husband the wealthiest couple in the Kingdom of Spain. Their only rivals to this status were the House of Osuna. The duchess' relationship with famed Spanish painter Francisco de Goya and her somewhat eccentric personality have contributed greatly to a continuing interest in her life during the two centuries since her death. Goya executed several well-known portraits of the duchess, most of them during his stay at Sanlúcar de Barrameda (one of the Andalusian country seats of the House of Medina Sidonia) shortly after the death in 1796 of her husband, who was also the 15th Duke of Medina Sidonia. Goya's accompaniment of the recently widowed duchess, combined with certain innuendo expressed in his portraits of her, have exacerbated rumors that the two were lovers.http://eeweems.com/goya/duchess_black.html Although this has never been confirmed, the large number of portraits that the artist painted of the duchess suggests, at the very least, a close platonic relationship between the two. The painting La maja desnuda, executed between 1797 and 1800 by Goya, has also been rumored to portray her. The painting, considered scandalous by Spanish society of the time, depicts a fully nude reclining woman. It, together with a companion piece depicting the same model clothed (La maja vestida), was commissioned by Spanish prime minister Manuel Godoy (the known lover of Spain's queen, María Luisa). The true identity of the majas is uncertain. Many art historians over the years have rejected the possibility that the painting depicts the duchess, including Australian art critic Robert Hughes in his 2003 biography, Goya. Those scholars believe that the painting depicts either Godoy's young mistress, Pepita Tudó, or an idealized composite of several different models.The Clothed Maja and the Nude Maja, the Prado Retrieved 27 July 2007 Death and succession The duchess died under somewhat mysterious circumstances in July 1802 at the age of 40. Although her death was ostensibly due to tuberculosis and a fever, more colorful scenarios have been suggested over the years, among them a theory that she was poisoned (this theory was dramatized in the film The Naked Maja). She had no biological children, although she did have an adoptive daughter, known as María de la Luz. After her death, the Alba ducal title passed to a relative, Carlos Miguel Fitz-James Stuart (1794–1835), who became the 14th Duke of Alba.

Career Born and raised in the small town of Panguitch, Utah, Owens graduated from Panguitch High School in 1955, then attended the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, from which he earned his Bachelor's degree in 1961 and his Juris Doctor in 1964. Owens' undergraduate education was interrupted while he served as missionary to France for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church) from 1957 to 1960. In France, he met his future wife, Marlene, a fellow missionary for the church. Owens worked his way through college and law school through working various jobs, including being a night- watchman at the Beehive House. He then worked as a lawyer in private practice and as a staffer for three United States Senators, Frank Moss of Utah, Robert F. Kennedy of New York, and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. He was the Western states coordinator for the presidential campaigns of Robert Kennedy in 1968 and Edward Kennedy in 1980, and served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968 and 1980. U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) (left) holds a press conference with U.S. Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah) (right) in March 1989 as part of their successful charge to win passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which provides for ongoing compensation to Southern Utahns and others damaged by nuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1972, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat by \\"walking for Congress\\" throughout the district to meet voters personally. He unseated incumbent Republican Sherman P. Lloyd with 55% of the vote. During that period, he sat on the House Judiciary Committee which voted for the articles of impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. He ran an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign against Jake Garn in 1974, then served as a mission president of the LDS Canada Montreal Mission from 1975 to 1978, after which he returned to Salt Lake City to practice law. In 1984, Owens lost the Utah gubernatorial race to Republican Norman H. Bangerter, but was re-elected to the House in 1986 and served through 1992, when he ran for the U.S. Senate again. That year, he was defeated by a wider margin than expected by Bob Bennett. Owens was embarrassed that year by his involvement in the so-called House banking scandal,Candidates support House list all names of check- bouncers. Owens was cleared by the House Ethics Committee of any wrong-doing, as the \\"scandal\\" was essentially generous overdraft protection and no taxpayer money was ever at risk. Owens was attacked for his \\"liberal\\" voting record, which his supporters contended actually was liberal only by the standard of conservative Utah politics. Following his Senate defeat, he retired to semi- private life but remained a tireless proponent for the causes he had championed in the U.S. Congress. Throughout his congressional career, Owens was a friend to environmentalists (he would later serve on the boards of several environmental organizations within the state), an advocate for \\"downwinders\\" who had suffered radiation exposure during atomic testing in Nevada in the 1950s, a strong supporter of the Central Utah Project to bring much-needed water to the region, and founder of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation. He always considered his vote, along with the votes of his fellow freshman congressmen, to force the vote that ended the Vietnam War to be one of the highlights of his career. Personal life After serving as a congressman, Owens was selected as a LDS Mission President and served as such for a three year tenure in the Montreal mission in Canada 1975 to 1978.

Karl Henry Buesgen, Sr. (December 25, 1916 – December 14, 1981) was an American landscape painter and Pennsylvania impressionist typically associated with the Baum Circle, a group of artists either taught by, associated with, or directly influenced by Pennsylvania impressionist painter Walter Emerson Baum. Buesgen was born on Christmas Day, 1916 in Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. He was the only surviving son of Joseph Herman and Katherine (née Hörth) Buesgen, both second generation German immigrants who worked in Allentown's silk and textile mills. As a young man, Buesgen studied to become a musician, and trained in piano, organ and voice. His family was involved with Allentown's Sacred Heart of Jesus Roman Catholic Church (his grandfather, Henry Buesgen, was a founding member), and he soon became a student of that church's organist and choirmaster, John Birmelin. When Birmelin retired in 1950, Buesgen was given Birmelin's post - a position he would hold for the remainder of his life. Buesgen also actively worked as a piano, organ and voice teacher in Allentown, and served as organist and choirmaster for a number of local churches. Buesgen was a dedicated student of painting, and studied with both Walter Emerson Baum (1884–1956) and John E. Berninger (1897–1981). Like most impressionist painters, Buesgen painted landscapes en plein air (directly from nature) or from colored slides of photographs he took with his camera. The greatest influence to Buesgen's work was John E. Berninger, his friend and teacher. For 40 years, Berninger and Buesgen spent nearly every Saturday visiting and talking, and every Sunday afternoon painting together. This relationship continued until Berninger's death in 1981. Buesgen died later that same year. From June 2 – July 6, 2005, the Baum School of Art hosted a solo exhibition of Buesgen's paintings. In 2006, his paintings were included in a group exhibition at the Baum School highlighting the works of members of the Baum Circle.

They speak the Gumuz language, which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan family. The Gumuz number around 200,000 individuals. History Flag of the Benishangul-Gumuz Region. The Gumuz have traditionally been grouped with other Nilotic peoples living along the Sudanese-Ethiopian border under the collective name Shanqella (Pankhurst 1977). As \\"Shanquella\\", they are already mentioned by Scottish explorer James Bruce in his Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, published in 1790. He notes that they hunted with bows and arrows, a custom that survives today. Most Gumuz members live in a bush-savanna lowland environment. According to their traditions, in earlier times they inhabited the western parts of the province of Gojjam, but were progressively banished to the inhospitable area of the Blue Nile and its tributaries by their more powerful Afroasiatic-speaking neighbors, the Amhara and Agaw, who also enslaved them (Wolde-Selassie Abbute 2004). Slavery did not disappear in Ethiopia until the 1940s. Descendants of Gumuz people taken as slaves to the area just south of Welkite were found to still be speaking the language in 1984 (Unseth 1985).

Demographics As of 2007, there were around 159,418 Gumuz in Ethiopia. Around 67,000 Gumuz also lived in Sudan. Culture A Gumuz granary in the village of Manjari, Metekel zone, western Ethiopia. The Gumuz practice shifting cultivation and their staple food is sorghum (Wallmark 1981). Cereal crops are kept in granaries decorated with clay lumps imitating female breasts. Sorghum is used for cooking porridge (nga) and brewing beer (kea). All the cooking and brewing is carried out in earthen pots, which are made by women. The Gumuz also hunt wild animals, such as duikers and warthogs, and gather honey, wild fruits, roots and seeds. Those living near the Sudanese borderland converted to Islam and a few are Christians, but most Gumuz still maintain traditional religious practices. Spirits are called mus'a and are thought to dwell in houses, granaries, fields, trees and mountains. They have ritual specialists called gafea. Originally, all Gumuz adorned their bodies with scarifications, but this custom is disappearing through government pressure and education. All Gumuz are organized in clans. Feuds between clans are common and they are usually solved by means of an institution of conflict resolution, called mangema or michu depending on the region. As it used to be among the Sudanese Uduk, marriage is through sister exchangeJames, W. (1975). Sister-Exchange Marriage. Scientific American, 233(6), 84–94. https://doi.org/10.1038/scientificamerican1275-84 James 1986Klausberger 1975. Recent developments Many changes have occurred for the Gumuz people since the 1980s. There has been resettlement of highlanders to their area, particularly linked to the availability of land and water. For instance, settlers were attracted to a large irrigation project along the Kusa or Beles River. Often the Gumuz’ lands have been allocated to transnational or domestic investors. In several parts of the Gumuz area, the settlers’ economy now dominates. Many Gumuz have become sedentary but have maintained their agricultural system. Though a transit road has been built and commercial farms established in the lower basin one should consider the Gumuz people as “peripheral” in regard to the Ethiopian highlands that hold the power in the country.

Like most medical associations, the Academy collects dues, provides continuing education and seminars for its members, including its four-day annual meeting. Outside the medical community it promotes public health information. Also, like most other medical associations, the Academy takes public policy stances on issues through lobbying (carried out by its Washington, D.C.-based Governmental Affairs Division). In 2006, the Academy launched EyeSmart, a program to educate the public about the importance of eye health. The EyeSmart website, which was relaunched in 2016, provides ophthalmologist-reviewed information about eye diseases, conditions and injuries.

Wolfram Media, Inc., May 14, 2002. The code is based on the observation that a table specifying the new state of each cell in the automaton, as a function of the states in its neighborhood, may be interpreted as a k-digit number in the S-ary positional number system, where S is the number of states that each cell in the automaton may have, k = S2n + 1 is the number of neighborhood configurations, and n is the radius of the neighborhood. Thus, the Wolfram code for a particular rule is a number in the range from 0 to SS − 1, converted from S-ary to decimal notation. It may be calculated as follows: # List all the S2n + 1 possible state configurations of the neighbourhood of a given cell. # Interpreting each configuration as a number as described above, sort them in descending numerical order. # For each configuration, list the state which the given cell will have, according to this rule, on the next iteration. # Interpret the resulting list of states again as an S-ary number, and convert this number to decimal. The resulting decimal number is the Wolfram code. The Wolfram code does not specify the size (nor shape) of the neighbourhood, nor the number of states — these are assumed to be known from context. When used on their own without such context, the codes are often assumed to refer to the class of elementary cellular automata, two-state one- dimensional cellular automata with a (contiguous) three-cell neighbourhood, which Wolfram extensively investigates in his book. Notable rules in this class include rule 30, rule 110, and rule 184. Rule 90 is also interesting because it creates Pascal's Triangle modulo 2. A code of this type suffixed by an R, such as \\"Rule 37R\\", indicates a second-order cellular automaton with the same neighborhood structure. While in a strict sense every Wolfram code in the valid range defines a different rule, some of these rules are isomorphic and usually considered equivalent. For example, rule 110 above is isomorphic with the rules 124, 137 and 193, which can be obtained from the original by left- right reflection and by renumbering the states. By convention, each such isomorphism class is represented by the rule with the lowest code number in it. A disadvantage of the Wolfram notation, and the use of decimal notation in particular, is that it makes such isomorphisms harder to see than some alternative notations. Despite this, it has become the de facto standard way of referring to one-dimensional cellular automata.  Generalized cellular automata  The number of possible rules, R, for a generalized cellular automaton in which each cell may assume one of S states as determined by a neighborhood size of n, in a D-dimensional space is given by: R=SS(2n+1)D The most common example has S = 2, n = 1 and D = 1, giving R = 256. The number of possible rules has an extreme dependence on the dimensionality of the system. For example, increasing the number of dimensions (D) from 1 to 2 increases the number of possible rules from 256 to 2512 (which is ~1.341×10154).

The school provides nursery, primary and secondary school facilities. It draws many pupils from surrounding Perth and Kinross and Stirling.  History  Morrison's Academy owes its foundation to Thomas Morison (also spelled Morrison). Born in 1761 in the village of Muthill; his mother belonged to Crieff. Morison trained as a stonemason and, after working some years in Auchterarder, he moved to Edinburgh and set up his own business. He made his fortune as the builder of a substantial part of the city's beautiful Georgian New Town (the sections north of Queen Street). Morison died age 59 on 30 August 1820 in Edinburgh. He had no children and, rather than letting his entire fortune fall into the hands of relatives, directed his trustees in his will to: \\"erect and endow an institution or institutions as to them shall appear best calculated to promote the interests of mankind, having a particular regard to the Education of youth and the diffusion of knowledge.\\" And he continues, \\"although I do not wish to confine this object to a particular place, yet I have regard in my views to the part of the country where I was born, and to the city of Edinburgh, where I long resided and acquired my fortune.\\" He finishes by saying, \\"I rather incline to point at a new institution which may bear my name and preserve the remembrance of my good intentions for the welfare and happiness of my fellowmen\\". After years of searching for a suitable location, his trustees decided on Crieff, near to where Morison was born, rather than Edinburgh which was already well served with schools. They purchased the old market site where the cattle tryst used to be held before it moved south to Falkirk. The school opened for business on 1 October 1860. Morison is buried in the north-east corner of the north extension to Edinburgh's St. Cuthbert's Churchyard.

Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The specific epithet rigidifolia is formed from the Latin words rigidus (rigid) and folia (leaves), and refers to the plant's stiff, coriaceous leaf blades. Tahul-tahul has been recorded as a local vernacular name for this species. Botanical history Nepenthes rigidifolia was discovered by Ch'ien Lee some time before 2001. The species was mentioned as an undescribed taxon in Charles Clarke's 2001 book, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, under the name \\"Nepenthes species A\\". At the time, it was recorded as growing at an elevation of around 1600 m. In 2004, Ch'ien Lee informally named the species N. alpicola and later N. aptera. Cultivated plants were sold under both of these names. Although intended to become scientific names, they were never published with an adequate description and are thus considered nomina nuda.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes rigidifolia. Carnivorous Plant Database. Instead, the species was formally described later that year as N. rigidifolia by Pitra Akhriadi, Hernawati, and Rusjdi Tamin. The description was published on November 22, 2004.Nepenthes rigidifolia Akhriadi, Hernawati & Tamin. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). Two years later, Hernawati and Akhriadi covered the species in their book, A Field Guide to the Nepenthes of Sumatra, and assessed its conservation status.Hernawati & P. Akhriadi 2006. A Field Guide to the Nepenthes of Sumatra. PILI-NGO Movement, Bogor. The holotype of N. rigidifolia—Nepenthes Team (Hernawati, P. Akhriadi & I. Petra) NP 354—was collected on December 11, 2003, near Sidikalang in Karo Regency, North Sumatra, at an elevation of 1000–1500 m. It is deposited at the Herbarium Universitas Andalas (ANDA) of Andalas University in Padang, West Sumatra. An isotype is held at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO) in Java. Stewart McPherson observed N. rigidifolia at the type locality in 2007 and published an updated description of the species in his 2009 monograph, Pitcher Plants of the Old World. Description Nepenthes rigidifolia is a climbing plant. The stem, which may be branched,McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. is cylindrical and up to 1.3 cm in diameter. It can attain a length in excess of 10 m. Internodes are up to 5.1 cm long. rosette plant, showing the shape of the laminae Leaves are sessile to broadly sub-petiolate and have a coriaceous texture. They are noted for being particularly thick and rigid. The lamina is usually spathulate- oblong, but may also be ovate in rosettes. It reaches a maximum recorded length of 20.8 cm and width of 7.8 cm. It is gradually attenuate towards the base, clasping the stem for half to two-thirds of its circumference. The apex of the lamina is usually obtuse-rounded in rosettes and obtuse-acute on leaves of the climbing stem, but may also be acuminate-acute. It may be sub-peltate in some specimens, with the tendril attachment being located subapically, up to 9 mm from the laminar apex. The midrib may be flattened or sunken on the upper surface and bulges outwards on the lower. Two to four longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are distinct on the upper surface of the lamina and indistinct on its underside. Tendrils are up to 32.1 cm long and may or may not have a loop. Rosette and lower pitchers are broadly ovoid throughout, narrowing somewhat towards the orifice. They grow up to 15 cm in height by 6.4 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (≤2 mm wide) extends up to 2 cm below the peristome, before narrowing to ribs. These wings may bear fringe elements up to 5 mm long. The pitcher mouth is elliptic-ovate and has an oblique insertion, measuring up to 6.7 cm by 4.7 cm. The peristome is cylindrical, expanded, and up to 2.1 cm wide. It may be slightly raised at the front, forming a notch up to 1.1 cm long. It bears ribs up to 0.5 mm high and spaced up to 1 mm apart. The inner margin of the peristome is lined with very small but distinct teeth measuring 0.5–1 mm in length. The outer margin is recurved and may be sinuate to some degree. The peristome is elongated into a neck up to 6.7 cm long and 4.7 cm wide. The glandular zone covers the lower half of the inner surface. The pitcher lid is sub-orbicular to elliptic-ovate and may be up to 5.2 cm long by 3.5 cm wide. It often has a cordate base and acute-obtuse apex. Three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the lid. A number of circular or slightly ovate nectar glands (≤ 0.1 mm wide) are concentrated on the underside of the lid, but no appendages are present. A spur measuring up to 12 mm in length is inserted around 2 mm below the apex of the neck. It may be simple (unbranched) or trifid. A typical upper pitcher with a hand for size comparison Upper pitchers are similar in most respects to their lower counterparts. They are broadly infundibular in the lower third and ovoid above, narrowing below the pitcher opening. They are also larger, reaching 21.1 cm in height and 9.4 cm in width. Wings are reduced to narrow ribs that run the whole length of the pitcher cup. The peristome is cylindrical and up to 4.4 cm wide. As in lower pitchers, it bears ribs up to 0.5 mm high and spaced up to 1 mm apart. The lid is up to 7.9 cm long and 5.6 cm wide. The spur, reported to be bifid (with each branch being two-branched itself) and up to 16 mm long, is inserted near the base of the lid. Nepenthes rigidifolia has a racemose inflorescence. Female inflorescences have not been recorded in the wild. In male inflorescences, the rachis measures around 3.9 cm in length and the peduncle around 4.2 cm. Bracts are approximately 9 mm long by 4 mm wide. Flowers are produced on two-flowered partial peduncles bearing filiform basal bracteoles up to 2 mm long. The unbranched portion of the partial peduncles is up to 5 mm long. The pedicels themselves are up to 6 mm long. Tepals are ovate-oblong and measure up to 5 mm in length by 3 mm in width. The androphore is around 4 mm long and 1 mm in diameter. Nepenthes rigidifolia is one of the few Nepenthes species known to occasionally produce multiple inflorescences concurrently on a single stem. This unusual reproductive habit has also been observed in N. alba, N. ampullaria, N. attenboroughii, N. benstonei, N. philippinensis, N. sanguinea, and N. thai.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2009. Kew Bulletin 64(2): 319–325. The development of the indumentum is variable in this species. Some plants are completely glabrous, while others bear a covering of orange to brown hairs (≤1 mm long) on the stem, pitchers, tendrils, and portions of the inflorescence. Developing rosette pitchers and tendrils are often densely pubescent, while developing pitchers produced on the climbing stem are tomentose. The pitcher lid may be glabrous or pubescent. The peduncle is typically slightly pubescent, and the partial peduncles, pedicels, bracts, tepals, and androphores densely pubescent. The laminae are green, whereas the stem, midribs and tendrils range from green, through yellow, to orange or even red. Terrestrial pitchers have a distinctive colouration: their outer surface is black, brown, or purple, with numerous large flecks of greenish-white, brown, or orange. The upper part of the inner surface ranges from white to light green or light yellow, with dark red to black blotches. Both the peristome and lid may be dark red, dark brown, or even black, although the latter is commonly lighter on its lower surface. The pigmentation of the upper pitchers is generally similar to that of the lowers, although typically lighter. The describing authors observed that rosette pitchers typically have a dark brown peristome, whereas that of upper pitchers is often orange to dark red. Herbarium specimens have an almost black stem. Dried leaves are light brown above with a dark brown underside, whereas pitchers are blackish-brown with dark brown blotches and an almost black lid. No infraspecific taxa of N. rigidifolia have been described. A climbing stem with upper pitchers at the type locality Ecology Nepenthes rigidifolia is endemic to Sumatra, where it has been recorded from a single small area near Sidikalang in Karo Regency, North Sumatra province. The only known population of this species grows on a road bank. The describing authors counted 24 mature plants at the type locality. Subsequent field observations suggest that the population has since dwindled in number, with perhaps only two plants remaining.Amazing Species: Nepenthes rigidifolia . IUCN Red List. Nepenthes rigidifolia grows terrestrially in lower montane forest and scrub. Young plants have been observed growing as lithophytes. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1000–1600 m above sea level. It grows sympatrically with N. spectabilis and a natural hybrid between these species has been recorded. Nepenthes rigidifolia has been evaluated as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. This agrees with an informal assessment carried out in 2006 by Hernawati and Pitra Akhriadi, who also classified the species as Critically Endangered based on the IUCN criteria and using field data collected by the \\"Nepenthes Team\\" of Andalas University. Since it does not grow within a protected area, N. rigidifolia is threatened by habitat loss due to land clearing, land conversion, road broadening, and clearing of road banks. Other threats include forest and shrub fires as well as poaching by plant collectors. If the type locality is the site of the last remaining population of this species then it is one of rarest Nepenthes known and \\"threatened with imminent extinction\\". In Pitcher Plants of the Old World, Stewart McPherson wrote that field studies are \\"urgently required\\" to properly assess its conservation status. In 2010, the Rare Nepenthes Collection was established with the aim of conserving N. rigidifolia and three other critically endangered Nepenthes species: N. aristolochioides, N. clipeata, and N. khasiana.Ziemer, B. 2010. Exciting conservation news: the Rare Nepenthes Collection project! Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 39(3): 67.Nepenthes rigidifolia. Ark of Life.Bourke, G. 2010. Captive Exotics Newsletter 1(2): 5–6. Related species The pitchers of N. rigidifolia resemble those of N. bongso to a degree, although their colouration is closer to that of N. spectabilis. Nepenthes rigidifolia differs from N. bongso, N. ovata and related species in having mostly ovoid upper pitchers (compared to infundibular in the others), distinctly thick and coriaceous laminae, and a narrower, cylindrical peristome with very short teeth. In addition, the lower pitchers of N. bongso are considerably larger than those of N. rigidifolia. While recognising N. rigidifolia as a valid species in his Carnivorous Plant Database, taxonomist Jan Schlauer suggests that it may be conspecific with N. densiflora. Terrestrial pitchers of N. rigidifolia may superficially resemble those of N. spectabilis, but it can be distinguished from this species on the basis of its trap colouration, upper pitcher shape (largely ovate in N. rigidifolia versus predominantly cylindrical in N. spectabilis), thinner leaves, and branched spur. Natural hybrids An upper pitcher of the natural hybrid N. rigidifolia × N. spectabilis Only one natural hybrid involving N. rigidifolia (with N. spectabilis) is known. This cross, which is only known from a single open rocky outcrop, may now outnumber N. rigidifolia at the type locality (as observed by Stewart McPherson in 2007). The hybrid differs from N. rigidifolia in having narrower pitchers with a strongly infundibular base and distinct hip around the middle. On the other hand, the pitchers of this hybrid are broader than those of N. spectabilis and have an expanded peristome, as well as a markedly shorter spur. Charles Clarke wrote of this cross: \\"Unlike N. ovata × N. spectabilis (from Gunung Pangulubao), this hybrid seems to combine the more attractive characteristics of both parent species, producing large, beautifully coloured pitchers\\". The richly coloured lower pitchers of N. rigidifolia × N. spectabilis may superficially resemble those of N. macfarlanei. However, since that species is confined to Peninsular Malaysia, the two taxa are not easily confused. Notes a.The Latin diagnosis for N. rigidifolia reads: > Folia sessilia crassa rigide coriacea laminis ovatis ad spathulato-oblongis > 17.8–20.2 cm longis 5.6–7.8 cm latis venis longitudinalibus 3 vel 4, cirrho > subapicali 0.3–0.9 cm infra apicem inserto, ascidium superius ovoidissimum > 20.7–21.1 cm altum 7.2–9.4 cm latum, peristome expanso 2.2–4.4 cm lato, > ambobus lateris 4-lobatis antice incisura, collifero, operculo ovato, > calcare trifido, intus pubescenti, inflorescentiae pedunculus rami pedicelli > bracteoli tepali filamenta pubescentes, pedunculus c. 4.2 cm longus, ramis > 0.4–0.5 cm longis, pedicelli 0.5–0.6 cm longis bifloris. ─ Typus: Sumatra > Utara, Kab.

Madhesh and S. Shankar written, and directed by S. Shankar. The film features Arjun and Manisha Koirala playing the lead with Raghuvaran playing the antagonist while Vadivelu and Manivannan feature in supporting roles. The film featured an award-winning soundtrack composed by A. R. Rahman, cinematography by K. V. Anand and dialogues by Sujatha. The film revolves around an ambitious TV journalist, Pughazhendi, who gets his first interview with the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Pughazh asks harder questions, and the Chief Minister starts trembling and asks him to put his money where his mike is and become his replacement CM for a day. After initially rejecting the offer, Pugazh agrees and does such a great job on his first day, that the actual cabinet collapses and fresh elections are held, where state voters eventually elect him to be their new official Chief Minister. The subsequent unpopularity and jealousy that the old Chief Minister goes through results in him taking revenge on Pugazh, and how he is stopped forms the crux of the story. The film was released on 7 November 1999, as a Deepavali release. The film enjoyed positive critical acclaim and emerged as one of the top grossing Tamil films of 1999. The film ran for over 100 days in theaters and won awards on a regional scale. The film was then dubbed and released in Telugu as Oke Okkadu and later remade in Hindi as Nayak (2001) starring Anil Kapoor. This movie was also unofficial remade twice in Dhallywood (Cinema of Bangladesh) as Minister (2003) directed by Kazi Hayat starring Manna and Top Hero (2010) directed by Montazur Rahman Akbar starring Shakib Khan. The film also loosely remade in Tollywood (Cinema of West Bengal) as MLA Fatakeshto (2006) directed by Swapan Saha starring Mithun Chakraborty. Plot N. Pugazhendi aka Pugzeh (Arjun) is a news reporter working for QTV in Chennai. One day, a riot occurs between the students and the bus drivers in the city following a communal clash which disrupts normal life. The Chief Minister (CM) of the state, Aranganathar (Raghuvaran), informs the police over wireless not to arrest the protesters as they belong to his community and political party. The conversation is recorded by Pugazh in his video camera. Pugazh meets a village girl named Thenmozhi (Manisha Koirala) and falls in love with her. However, her father (Vijayakumar) does not accept the marriage proposal as he wants to get Thenmozhi married only to a government employee. One day, QTV arranges for a live interview with Aranganathar and the anchor in charge does not turn up at the last moment. Pugazh is thrilled and excited as he gets the opportunity to interview the CM. During the course of the interview, Pugazh unmasks many events done by Aranganathar and his party against the welfare of the state, for political reasons with necessary evidences, and he also blames Aranganathar for not taking action while at the riot by evidencing his recorded video taken at the time of the riot. Aranganathar justifies his indifferent stands and challenges Pugazh to accept his post for a day so that he will realize the pressures faced on a daily basis. Pugazh, after a brief trepidation, accepts the challenge provided the constitution permits. Lawmakers confirm that such a provision is possible, and Pugazh is sworn in as the CM for 24 hours. To everyone's surprise, Pugazh does not prefer speaking to the waiting media crew, but he gets into action immediately by collecting a list of irresponsible civil servants and issuing suspension letters immediately. He helps poor people rightfully reclaim houses allotted by the government and requests every Indian citizen to pay all required taxes even if it is for a day, highlighting the effects of avoiding the same. Mayakrishnan (Manivannan), an honest official, is the government secretary and helps Pugazh through his one-day mission. Finally, Pugazh digs a case of corruption against the ruling party leading to the arrest of Aranganathar. The next day, Aranganathar retains as the CM and cancels all orders issued from the previous day. Taking Pugazh's success as his defeat and a demean to his long-standing political career, he plans to take revenge and sends goons to kill Pugazh, who escapes with heavy injuries. Aranganathar's image is tarnished before the public, and the coalition parties withdraw their support, resulting in dissolving the government and leading to another election. A huge crowd gathers in front of Pugazh's house, requesting him to contest in the upcoming election. Other political parties also come forward to offer their support for their own reasons. However, Pugazh is not for it as he wants to have a safe and secure life. Thenmozhi's father advises him not to go in politics, while accepting him to marry Thenmozhi. Mayakrishnan makes him understand how much the people have gathered themselves and shows the plight of people and advises him to sacrifice his comfort zone for the sake of achieving heights in the politics and doing good for the people. Finally, Pugazh accepts to it and contests in the ensuing election and wins by the vast majority of voters ever in the political history of Tamil Nadu. After assuming the office, Pugazh is keen in the state development and gets busy in his schedule of doing welfare to the people, while Aranganathar and other politicians unite as they are worried by the change of events. They hire a hitman to get Pugazh killed, but he escapes with the help of the Z Cadre security guard officials, who shoot the hitman to death. A bomb planted in Pugazh's house to kill Pugazh, instead claims the lives of his parents. Pugazh, on knowing that Aranganathar is behind this, gets enraged and challenges the latter that the law will not spare him. Aranganathar plans to create a havoc in the rule of Pugazh, and hence, he has his men plant bombs across Chennai. Pugazh and Mayakrishnan get to know of this by a tactful inquiry of Chinnasamy (Cochin Haneefa), who is Aranganathar's right-hand henchman. The bomb squad diffuses all the bombs except one. Aranganathar blames Pugazh to be the man behind the entire episode and claims it as a ploy to win public support. Pugazh realizes that he will be prevented from performing his duties and invites Aranganathar to his office. As their conversation progresses, Pugazh pulls out a gun and shoots himself without causing any major injuries. He throws the gun to Aranganathar who catches it out of his reflexes. At the same time, the security guards officials rush in upon hearing gunfire and see Aranganathar pointing the gun at Pugazh. The security guards officials then shoot and kill Aranganathar to save Pugazh. Pugazh feels glad that he can continue his mission without being interrupted, but he also feels guilty for having staged a false incident to kill Aranganathar. He confesses to Mayakrishnan that even he has been forced to play the game of politics. Mayakrishnan supports him by consoling that he played the politics only for a good cause and that Aranganathar deserves this. Thenmozhi's father realizes the greatness of Pugazhendhi and consents to the marriage. The movie ends showing Tamil Nadu as a developed state under the rule of Pugazh with world class infrastructures and free of violence.

The idea for the story was inspired by Indian actor Sivaji Ganesan being named the honorary mayor of Niagara Falls, New York for one day during his visit to the United States.The Penguin-Landmark Quiz Book pp. 60, 173 The lead role was initially written with Rajinikanth in mind, but he was unwilling to star in the film. Vijay was also considered by Shankar for the role, though the actor turned the offer down. Shankar revealed that he even approached Kamal Haasan for the film, but he was doing Hey Ram at that time. Arjun, who had previously collaborated with Shankar in Gentleman (1993), was willing to offer bulk schedule dates for the film and was subsequently signed on. Shankar noted that he was interested in casting Meena in the leading role, but he opted against doing so as the actress was working with Arjun in another film in the same period, Rhythm (2000).https://web.archive.org/web/19991118124233/http://www.screenindia.com/south.htm Subsequently, Manisha Koirala, who worked with Shankar in Indian, was selected to play Arjun's heroine. Raghuvaran was signed to play the chief antagonist in the film, while Vadivelu and Manivannan were also chosen to play other characters. Despite reports that Shilpa Shetty was added to the cast in February 1999, it was later clarified to be untrue. Laila, who had made her acting debut earlier in the year with Kallazhagar, was signed on to portray the role planned with Shetty instead. Originally, her role was supposed to feature throughout the film, but Shankar shortened her character, owing to her call sheet problems. Renowned muralist Natanam and Kalairani were cast as Arjun's parents. S. Sashikanth, who went on to produce films like Thamizh Padam (2010) and Kaaviya Thalaivan (2014), and K. R. Mathivaanan, who directed Aridhu Aridhu (2010), worked as assistant directors. The film was jointly launched by S.Shankar and his co director R. Madhesh in October 1998 at an event attended by actors and technicians from the Tamil film industry, with actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan being the special invitees. Production continued for several months, with reports suggesting that the film was delayed due to Manisha Koirala's unavailability though Shankar later stressed the production work demanded such delay. Parts of the film were also shot in Bikaner, Rajasthan while the team also shot extensively in rural Tamil Nadu. The film's cinematographer later noted that the scenes involving crowds shot on Anna Salai, Chennai were among the hardest and most satisfying scenes he had worked on. The song \\"Shakalaka Baby\\" was the last song to be shot, with Sushmita Sen selected to feature in a special appearance for the song. Stunt master Peter Hein revealed that he worked as a body double for Arjun in the scene where he had to run nude on the streets. Themes and influences The film dealt with the theme of a television cameraman who is forced to take over the duty of Chief Minister for one day. It also dealt with the concept of opportunities for educated people in politics and demonstrated it is possible to bring change in the country. The film's basic idea was inspired from Nixon- Frost interviews which were broadcast in 1977. Music The soundtrack features six songs composed by A. R. Rahman and lyrics penned by Vairamuthu. The song \\"Shakalaka Baby\\" was re-edited by A. R. Rahman and featured on the international musical production Bombay Dreams, which ran in Europe and North America from 2002 to 2005. This version was also released as a single. A Mandarin Chinese remix of the track sung by Singaporean singer Kelly Poon was featured in her album In the Heart Of The World (2007). The release of the soundtrack was held at Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai, on 31 October 1999 with two songs from the film being performed on stage. The special guests for the event were actor Kamal Haasan and actress Sushmita Sen, who performed an item number in the film. The event was well attended by the cast and the crew of the film, with other guests including cinematographer P. C. Sriram, actress Sarika, and actor Suriya. The soundtrack was a success, and the initial day audio sale alone was more than three lakh units. The song \\"Azhagana Rakshasiye\\" is based on Rithigowla Raga. Release The film's release prints were long. Upon release on 7 November 1999, this high-budget production won positive reviews and was successful at the box office. The film was then dubbed and released in Telugu as Oke Okkadu and later remade in Hindi as Nayak starring Anil Kapoor. The film went on to run for over one hundred days in cinemas with an event being held at Kamaraj Hall on 25 February 2000 to mark one hundred days since release. The event, similar to the launch, attracted several people from the film industry with Kamal Haasan, once again, being the chief guest of the event.  Reception  On 21 November 1999, Ananda Vikatan in its review gave 43 marks and appreciated the film stating that: \\"One can see Shankar's grandeur in the way he presented a social problem magnificently. Shankar has approached a serious social issue with usual entertainment elements\\". The Hindu said \\"Shankar scores again\\". In regard to the lead performances, Arjun is described as having \\"acquitted himself with aplomb\\", while Manisha's performance was criticized with claims that she \\"lacks the freshness that one always associates her with\\". The critic also referred to Shankar's direction and Sujatha's dialogs as a \\"positive\\", while drawing praise to the videos of the songs describing that \\"every song and dance sequence seems a magnum opus by itself\\". The New Indian Express described the film as \\"absorbing\\" and praised certain scenes, although it criticized the videos of the songs as a \\"fiasco\\". Indiaglitz wrote: \\"Mudhalvan spoke about current affairs in India. With an absorbing screenplay and conveying the message of change in the political system, the film was a runaway hit.\\" Awards *Filmfare Best Music Director Award - A. R.

Lee, a native of Los Angeles, claimed to be in telepathic communication with an entity known as JW, who lived on the planet Venus, and began to assemble a book of his spiritual teachings as dictated to her. At his direction she founded the Cosmon Research Foundation for the purpose of publication and study of JW's superhuman wisdom, much of which bore some resemblance to the 1882 teachings of Oahspe. Membership in Lee's organization rose sharply after advertisements were regularly carried in Ray Palmer's monthly occult magazine Fate. She hit the contactee lecture circuit and attracted considerable public attention. During her lectures, Lee sold copies of her book of revelations, Why We Are Here! (1959). The year of her death, a second \\"JW\\" book was published, The Changing Conditions of Your World! (1962). She developed a plan for world peace and a space station design and took them to Washington D.C. in late 1962 in an attempt to bring them to the attention of officials. However, after being rebuffed, she launched a hunger strike or protest fast, telling others in the UFO contactee community that she expected to enter a coma resembling death, then \\"return\\" with renewed spiritual energy to carry on her \\"great work\\". However, the press were not notified of Lee's hunger strike until some time after it had begun, and she attracted no publicity.

Trego from 1904–1909, taking lessons at Trego's home in North Wales, Pennsylvania - about 15 miles south of Sellersville. Baum attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and 1906, studying with Thomas Pollock Anshutz, Hugh H. Breckenridge, William Merritt Chase, and Cecilia Beaux. Faced with the responsibilities of a wife and four children, Marian, Ruth, Robert and Edgar, Baum took odd jobs to support his family. He worked in the family's barbershop, and worked as a photographer for The Poultry Item, a magazine which focused on chickens, ducks and geese. He also wrote for the local newspaper, the Sellersville Herald, and was made an editor in 1921 (he wrote columns for the paper until 1942). As his paintings became better known, he taught art classes at his home in Sellersville and at the local high school. =Baum as an educator= Baum was an active art instructor in the Allentown area from 1926 to 1956. Notable students of Baum include John E. Berninger, Karl Buesgen, Joseph Gehringer, Walter Mattern, and Melville Stark. \\"The Baum Circle\\" refers to the artists either taught by, associated with, or directly influenced by Baum. In October 2006, the David E. Rodale Gallery at the Baum School of Art held an exhibition celebrating the work of this group. =Baum as a writer and illustrator= Baum worked as a columnist for the Sellersville Herald. In 1921, he was promoted to editor of the paper, where he worked until 1942. At the Herald, Baum wrote a weekly column in which he discussed the history, culture and ideals of his home town. In 1938, Baum wrote Two Hundred Years (published by the Sellersville Herald, Sellersville Pennsylvania), a book documenting the history of the Pennsylvania Germans in the Sellersville area. Like his contemporaries N.C. Wyeth and Norman Rockwell, whose works graced the covers of The Saturday Evening Post for years, Baum also became involved in illustration. His first cover appeared in Curtis Publishing Company's Country Gentleman magazine in January 1931. In 1948, Baum provided illustrations and an introductory essay for the Selected Short Stories of Thomas Hardy (published by Rodale Press, Allentown Pennsylvania). Baum also worked as an art critic and reviewer for the Philadelphia Evening and Sunday Bulletin, a position in which, as an artist himself, he was able to bring a unique perspective that became popular with readers. In this role, he was also able to promote local art and artists. During the Great Depression, a period during which artists found it extremely difficult to find work, his column was important in keeping the vibrant Philadelphia art community active and informed. The Allentown Art Museum The \\"Allentown Art Gallery\\" was organized by Baum and opened in Allentown's Hunsicker School on March 17, 1934. With seventy canvases by local Pennsylvania impressionist artists on display, the gallery attracted major attention from the local and regional art communities. During the Great Depression, Baum was able to grow the collection through the Public Works of Art Project and through acquisitions and gifts. In June 1936, the City of Allentown granted the museum a permanent home in a Federal-style house located in the Rose Garden in Allentown's Cedar Park. The museum's first curator was local artist John E. Berninger, a student of Baum's, who lived with his wife on the museum's second floor. The Bucks County Traveling Art Gallery In 1949, Walter Emerson Baum and Dr. Charles H. Boehm, Bucks County Superintendent of Schools, established the Bucks County Traveling Art Gallery, a program whose goal was to expose school children of Bucks County to the artwork of the New Hope School and the Pennsylvania Impressionist movement. The county-wide program was formally established by Boehm after positive feedback was received from parents and teachers when a Baum painting was purchased to celebrate the retirement of one of Baum's grammar school teachers. The program was officially unveiled in a ceremony at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Notable Bucks County residents including Pearl S. Buck took part, as did many of the artists whose paintings were purchased for the gallery. The collection, which now includes over 350 pieces of art, has visited all of the thirteen school districts in the county, and is managed by the Bucks County Intermediate Unit and maintained by the James A. Michener Art Museum. Artists represented in the collection include Baum, Walter Elmer Schofield, Sarah Blakeslee, Harry Leith- Ross and Kenneth Nunamaker.History of the Bucks County Intermediate Unit Collection The \\"Bucks County Intermediate Unit Collection\\" is one of the most important collections of Pennsylvania Impressionist artwork outside of the Lenfest collection of the Michener Art Museum. It was the Bucks County Traveling Art Gallery that served as the impetus (albeit it took almost forty more years to come to fruition) for the establishment of a museum in Doylestown, Pennsylvania dedicated to the work of local artists. Family life Edgar Schofield Baum (1916–2006) was Walter Emerson Baum's eldest son. Edgar worked in a wide variety of media, including oil and acrylic painting, dyes, sculpture, and writing (specifically poetry and wit). He published a book of his writings, entitled Jest and Ernest: A Collection of Original Aphorisms and As-Isms. Edgar attended the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, and served as a combat medical officer in the European Theatre during World War II. At the end of the war, he returned to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and established a family practice. For over 40 years, his practice was located at 1624 Walnut Street, in the city's West Park neighborhood. He also served as a trustee of the Baum School of Art In October 2006, the David E. Rodale Gallery at the Baum School of Art held an exhibition celebrating the work of the Baum Circle. A memorial exhibition, celebrating the life and work of Baum, was held at the Baum School during June 2007.

It is characterised by its black mottled lower and upper pitchers. The species is closely related to N. angasanensis and N. tobaica.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The specific epithet mikei honours Mike Hopkins, who co- discovered the species with the describing authors. Botanical history Nepenthes mikei was discovered on Mount Pangulubao in September 1989 by Bruce Salmon, Mike Hopkins, and Ricky Maulder, during a Nepenthes expedition to Sumatra. On this trip, the team also found two other undescribed Nepenthes taxa on the mountain: N. ovata and a plant they named N. xiphioides. The latter is now considered a heterotypic synonym of N. gymnamphora.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes gymnamphora. Carnivorous Plant Database. An early colour photograph of N. mikei was published by Mike Hopkins, Ricky Maulder, and Bruce Salmon, in a 1990 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, where the plant was identified simply as Nepenthes sp. 'New Species'. The authors described it as follows: > We saw another Nepenthes that is different than the others we saw in the > higher highland areas. It has small pitchers slightly similar to N. > tentaculata, N. tobaica and N. gracilis but tougher and thicker. The > pitchers are always nicely colored with blackish lines and markings similar > to N. fusca. There was very little variation with this species as all mature > plants had ample rosettes on the ground and also at intervals up the stem. > The stems were slimbing up to about 7 meters and had upper pitchers similar > in color and shape to the lower pitchers but with the usual differences. The > male inflorescences were about 20 centimeters, peduncle inclusive. Prior to its description, N. mikei was known as N. minutissima among pitcher plant growers.Schlauer, J. 1995. Re: N.xiphioides + N.mikei. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, September 26, 1995. This name is a nomen nudum (naked name), as it was never formally published. Nepenthes mikei was formally described by Bruce Salmon and Ricky Maulder in a 1995 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter. The herbarium specimen B.Salmon & R.Maulder 221719 is the designated holotype, and is deposited at the Auckland Institute and Museum (AK) in Auckland, New Zealand.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes mikei. Carnivorous Plant Database. It was prepared on February 17, 1995, from a plant cultivated in New Zealand, and consists of a vine bearing a female inflorescence, a lower pitcher, and a rosette. The specimen was originally collected in 1989 from a \\"very steep ridge in wet mossy forest\\" near the summit of Mount Pangulubao, at an altitude of 2000 m. The authors described the plant as growing \\"in peaty humus or moss at the base of 5–6 m tall trees\\". Salmon and Maulder also pressed a second specimen of N. mikei from material collected at the same elevation on Pangulubao. Additional herbarium specimens of N. mikei are known and these show slight morphological variability. In 1997, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek published their monograph \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", in which they provided an emended description of N. mikei that encompassed specimens of the closely related, and at the time undescribed, N. angasanensis from Mount Leuser, Goh Lembuh, and the Kappi region. Salmon and Maulder did not support this interpretation and reinstated their original description of N. mikei when they described N. angasanensis in 1999.Salmon, B.R. & R.G. Maulder 1999. Notes on Nepenthes from Northern Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 28(1): 14–18. Jebb and Cheek retained N. angasanensis as a synonym of N. mikei in their 2001 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\", writing: \\"We suspect that it [N. angasanensis] may prove not distinct from N. mikei and here treat it as a synonym.\\" Description A climbing stem with an upper pitcher, showing the lamina shape Nepenthes mikei is a climbing plant growing to a height of 7 m. The stem, which may be branched, is up to 0.4 cm in diameter and has cylindrical to angular internodes measuring up to 9 cm in length. Plants from Mount Bandahara are known to produce offshoots from short underground rhizomes. Nepenthes mikei is noted for rapidly transitioning from a rosette to a climbing stage; sequential internodal lengths of 2–3 mm and 10 cm have been recorded. Leaves are sessile and coriaceous in texture. The lamina (leaf blade) is linear and measures up to 10 cm in length by 2 cm in width. Its apex may be acute or obtuse and it is abruptly contracted at the base, clasping the stem for around half of its circumference. One to two longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib, while pinnate veins are irregularly reticulate. The upper surface of the lamina is typically green, but may be red if exposed to direct sunlight. Tendrils are up to 15 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers are ovate in the basal third to quarter of the pitcher cup, becoming approximately cylindrical above and infundibular towards the pitcher mouth. They are relatively small, growing to only 12 cm in height by 3 cm in width. A pair of wings (≤4 mm wide) typically runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup, with fringe elements measuring up to 8 mm in length. These wings may be reduced to ribs in some plants. The glandular region on the inner surface is restricted to the ovate portion of the pitcher cup. The glands are small (0.2–0.3 mm in diameter) and occur at a density of around 150–180 per square centimetre. The waxy zone is well developed and eye spots may occasionally be present on the rear inner surface, visible through the opening. The peristome is sub-cylindrical to cylindrical and up to 4 mm wide. It bears ribs up to 0.1 mm high and spaced 0.2 mm apart, which terminate in teeth up to 0.4 mm long. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 51% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90–102. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate and has a cordate base. It measures up to 3 cm in length by 2.5 cm in width and does not bear any appendages. The underside of the lid has an even distribution of small (0.1–0.2 mm in diameter) convex glands, occurring at a density of about 40/cm2. The spur, which is inserted near the base of the lid, is up to 7 mm long and may be simple, forked, or fasciculate with up to 12 branches. A typical upper pitcher Upper pitchers are ovate in their basal third to fifth, becoming cylindrical above and infundibular towards the peristome. They are smaller than their lower counterparts, reaching only 8 cm in height by 2 cm in width. Wings are always reduced to ribs. In other respects, upper pitchers are similar to the lower traps. Nepenthes mikei has a racemose inflorescence measuring up to 18 cm in length by 1.8 cm in diameter. The peduncle itself may be up to 8 cm long by 1 mm wide in female plants, and up to 3 cm long in males. The rachis is up to 8 cm long. The inflorescence bears one-flowered pedicels (≤6 mm long), which may be bracteoleate. The oblong-lanceolate tepals measure up to 4 mm in length. Fruits are up to 22 mm long. Most parts of the plant are glabrous. An indumentum of short, white or yellowish hairs is usually present on the tendrils and some parts of the inflorescence. This indumentum is a mixture of simple and stellate hairs. Caducous hairs cover developing pitchers and other parts. Ecology Nepenthes mikei is endemic to the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where it has been recorded from only two mountains: Mount Pangulubao in North Sumatra and Mount Bandahara in Aceh. Its altitudinal distribution extends from 1100 to 2800 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. N. flava and N. mikei The typical habitat of this species is summit scrub vegetation as well as lower and upper montane mossy forest. It always grows terrestrially, often in open sites such as ridge tops and cliff sides, where it is exposed to direct sunlight. The species is rare in blangs, where the lack of surrounding vegetation means the stems scramble along the ground. Nepenthes mikei may be difficult to find on Mount Pangulubao,Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Another nice trip to Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4–10. where it is sympatric with N. gymnamphora (N. xiphioides), N. ovata, and N. spectabilis. On Mount Bandahara, where it is common above 2400 m, it grows alongside N. diatas.Harwood, P., H. Rischer & A. Wistuba 1998. The carnivorous flora of Gunung Bandahara. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 27(2): 59–61. Natural hybrids with all of these species have been recorded. At another location, which is undisclosed for conservation purposes, N. mikei grows alongside N. flava.Wistuba, A., J. Nerz & A. Fleischmann 2007. flava, a new species of Nepenthaceae from the northern part of Sumatra. Blumea 52(1): 159–163. The conservation status of N. mikei is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, based on an assessment carried out in 2000. This agrees with an informal assessment made by Charles Clarke in 2001, who also classified the species as Vulnerable based on the IUCN criteria. However, Clarke noted that since substantial populations of N. mikei lie within protected areas, they \\"are unlikely to become threatened in the foreseeable future\\". Taking this into account, he suggested a revised assessment of Conservation Dependent. The species is threatened by habitat loss and disturbance, as well as over-collection by plant collectors.Hernawati & P. Akhriadi 2006. A Field Guide to the Nepenthes of Sumatra. PILI-NGO Movement, Bogor. Related species Nepenthes mikei is most closely allied to the Sumatran endemics N. angasanensis and N. tobaica, and may be conspecific with the former. In their description of N. mikei, Salmon and Maulder noted many differences between it and N. angasanensis which are now known to be unreliable. For example, the authors wrote that N. angasanensis produces offshoots from underground rhizomes, while N. mikei does not; populations of N. mikei from Mount Bandahara are now known to produce such offshoots. Similarly, N. angasanensis was said to lack a fasciculate spur, but this has since been recorded in lower pitchers of this species. Disregarding these supposed differences leaves only a few stable distinguishing features between the species. Firstly, the teeth lining the inner margin of the peristome are shorter in N. mikei, although both have minute teeth and this difference is minor. Secondly, the pedicels of N. mikei bear simple bracteoles, while those of N. angasanensis do not. Finally, N. angasanensis exhibits a greater density of digestive glands on the inner pitcher surface. Offshoots from an old climbing stem bearing lower pitchers Nepenthes angasanensis and N. mikei are more easily distinguished by their differing ecology. While N. angasanensis is generally found growing terrestrially or epiphytically in shady mossy forest, N. mikei is always terrestrial and favours more exposed sites where it receives strong sunlight. Nepenthes angasanensis also typically produces longer stems, with regular offshoots from the leaf axils, although these have been observed in N. mikei as well. Nepenthes tobaica differs from N. mikei in a number of floral and vegetative features. Whereas the latter has a shorter inflorescence with flowers borne singly on pedicels, N. tobaica has two- flowered partial peduncles. In addition, N. tobaica lacks the fasciculate spur of N. mikei and generally has wider laminae. Salmon and Maulder also compared N. mikei to N. adnata and N. tentaculata. Stewart McPherson noted that the species may also superficially resemble N. eustachya in the shape of its pitchers. In 2001, Charles Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is a portion of the resultant cladogram, showing part of \\"Clade 6\\". The sister pair of N. angasanensis and N. mikei has 79% support. Clarke concluded that the \\"relationships between [these species] are very complex and are somewhat difficult to interpret at present\\". Natural hybrids Four natural hybrids involving N. mikei have been recorded. =N. diatas × N. mikei= Nepenthes diatas is restricted to Mount Bandahara and thus this hybrid only occurs on that mountain. This cross is common between 2300 and 2700 m, where the altitudinal ranges of the two species overlap. It was first reported in 1998. This hybrid is similar to N. mikei and also produces mostly black lower pitchers. It differs in that the terrestrial traps have a wider basal portion. The plant is also larger in stature, having broader stems and leaves, and bears a wider peristome than N. mikei. Nepenthes diatas × N. mikei has only been found at the forest margins in the summit area of Mount Bandahara. It has not been recorded from the mountain's open blangs. =Other hybrids= Three other natural hybrids — with N. gymnamphora, N. ovata, and N. spectabilis — have been observed. All three were first reported in 1995 by Salmon and Maulder from Mount Pangulubao. Nepenthes gymnamphora × N. mikei was given the informal name N. × pangulubauensis in 1996.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes × pangulubauensis. Carnivorous Plant Database. Notes :a.The second specimen of N. mikei, B.Salmon & R.Maulder 221718, was collected at the same elevation as the holotype and pressed on the same day. It consists of two lower pitchers, two upper pitchers, and a short shoot with pitchers. This specimen is also deposited at the Auckland Institute and Museum (AK). :b.The herbarium specimen de Wilde & de Wilde-Duyfjes 13190 exhibits pitchers with forked spurs, unlike the fasciculate spurs of the holotype. It is deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens in Bogor, Java. References * Meimberg, H., A. Wistuba, P. Dittrich & G. Heubl 2001.

Cambridge Online Dictionary, accessed 3 January 2019 It is used to discourage some kinds of activity. The practice occurs both at the domestic and at the international levels where naming and shaming is often used to denounce human rights violations. There is some evidence to indicate that naming and shaming reduces atrocities and causes named and shamed governments to improve their human rights records. Some scholars question whether naming and shaming has the intended effects. Public policy usage Naming offending individuals or businesses (with the implied objective of shaming them) is sometimes used as an instrument of public policy intended to promote compliance with legal obligations or with the obligation to put right the damage caused by non-compliance. Examples are: *The UK government established a scheme in 2010 to \\"name businesses which have failed to pay the National Minimum Wage to their employees. The policy objective of the naming scheme is \\"to raise awareness of minimum wage enforcement and deter employers who would otherwise be tempted to break minimum wage law\\". According to a government policy statement, this practice has been adopted because \\"the government recognises that some employers are more likely to respond to the social and economic sanctions that may flow from details of their payment practices being made public, than from financial deterrents\\".Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, National Minimum Wage Law: Enforcement, published November 2017, accessed 3 January 2019 *In December 2018 the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy introduced a \\"naming scheme\\" to exert reputational pressure on employers who fail to pay Employment Tribunal awards,Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (2018), Naming Scheme for Unpaid Employment Tribunal Awards, published 17 December 2018, accessed 28 December 2018 following publication of government research which found that 34% of employment tribunal awards in England and Wales and 46% in Scotland remained unpaid.Taylor, M.

According to its website, the AGR's mission is to \\"cover news underreported by mainstream media, believing that a free exchange of information is necessary to organize for social change. Since its inception in 1999, the Asheville Global Report received several awards, including 10 Project Censored Awards. Additionally, the American Civil Liberties Union of Western North Carolina presented the AGR with its \\"Champion of Civil Liberties Award\\" and the Utne Reader has nominated the AGR for “Best International Coverage in the United States.” According to anarchist blogger Chuck Munson the \\"AGR is an excellent example of what independent media activists could be doing in their local communities... [It] is mercifully free of the typical leftist rhetoric and jargon that one frequently finds in activist-run community newspapers.\\"Review: Asheville Global Report, Infoshop News “The Global Report is a favorite for International News among the 200 Project Censored students and faculty at Sonoma State University. For a readable digest of important international news stories I cannot think of a more comprehensive source.” —Peter Phillips, Director, Project Censored “A good example of how motivated citizens can provide a hard news alternative to the mainstream media in their communities.” —Adbusters On Sunday, May 20, 2007, AGR editor Eamon Martin announced that the organization would cease publication of its newspaper after eight and a half years due to the \\"difficulties in sustaining a grassroots publishing enterprise.\\" The non- profit news media project continued as a radio program, website, and as a television program broadcast nationwide via Free Speech TV on the Dish and Direct TV satellite networks until April 2011.

It is a systematic, disciplined approach to managing a product category as a strategic business unit. The phrase \\"category management\\" was coined by Brian F. Harris. Category management in a retail context Each category is run as a \\"mini business\\" (business unit) in its own right, with its own set of turnover and/or profitability targets and strategies. Introduction of Category Management in a business tends to alter the relationship between retailer and supplier: instead of the traditional adversarial relationship, the relationship moves to one of collaboration, with exchange of information, sharing of data and joint business building. The focus of all supplier negotiations is the effect on turnover of the category as whole, not just the sales of individual products. Suppliers are expected, indeed in many cases mandated, to only suggest new product introductions, a new planogram or promotional activity if it is expected to have a beneficial effect on the turnover or profit of the total category and be beneficial to the shoppers of that category. The concept originated in grocery (mass merchandising) retailing, and has since expanded to other retail sectors such as DIY, cash and carry, pharmacy, and book retailing.Category Management in Book Retailing Definition of category management (retail) Category management lacks a single definition thus leading to some ambiguity even among industry professionals as to its exact function. Three comparative mainstream definitions are as follows: \\"Category management is a process that involves managing product categories as business units and customizing them [on a store by store basis] to satisfy customer needs.\\" (Nielsen)Nielsen Category Management - Positioning Your Organisation to Win, p9 \\"The strategic management of product groups through trade partnerships which aims to maximize sales and profit by satisfying consumer and shopper needs\\" (Institute of Grocery Distribution)IGD definition \\".. marketing strategy in which a full line of products (instead of the individual products or brands) is managed as a strategic business unit (SBU).\\" (Business Dictionary)Business Dictionary Definition The Nielsen definition, published in 1992, was a little ahead of its time in that customising product offerings on a store by store basis is logistically difficult and is now not considered a necessary part of category management; it is a concept now referred to as micromarketing. Nevertheless, most grocery retailers will segment stores at least by size, and select product assortments accordingly. Wal*Mart's Store of the Community, implemented in North America, is one of the few examples of where product offerings are tailored right down to the specific store.Store of the Community Rationale for category management One key reason for the introduction of category management was the retailers' desire for suppliers to add value to their (i.e. the retailer's) business rather than just the supplier's own. For example, in a category containing brands A and B, the situation could arise such that every time brand A promoted its products, the sales of brand B would go down by the amount that brand A would increase, resulting in no net gain for the retailer. The introduction of category management imposed the condition that all actions undertaken, such as new promotions, new products, re-vamped planogram / schematics, shopper and consumer insights, and the introduction of point of sale advertising etc. were beneficial to the retailer and the shopper in the store. A second reason was the realization that only a finite amount of profit could be milked from price negotiations and that there was more profit to be made in increasing the total level of sales. A third reason was that the collaboration with the supplier meant that supplier's expertise about the market could be drawn upon, and also that a considerable amount of workload in developing the category could be delegated to the supplier.Rationale for Category Management Definition of a category The Nielsen definition of a 'category', used as the basic definition across the industry, is that the products should meet a similar consumer need, or that the products should be inter-related or substitutable.Nielsen Definition of a Category Archived copy The Nielsen definition also includes a provision that products placed together in the same category should be logistically manageable in store (for example there may be issues in having room- temperature and chilled products together in the same category even though the initial two conditions are met). However, this definition does not explain how the process often works in practical retailing situations, where demographic or marketing considerations take precedence. The next step of Category Management is to understand the mechanism of the customer's decision concerning purchases of a given category. The decision-making process is usually analysed by observing customers directly in the store and by direct surveying. The result is recorded in the Customer Decision Tree (CDT) The category management 8-step process (retail) The category management 8-step process The industry standard model for category management in retail is the 8-step process, or 8-step cycle developed by the Partnering Group.The 8-step Category Management process The eight steps are shown in the adjacent diagram; they are : # Define the category (i.e. what products are included/excluded). # Define the role of the category within the retailer. # Assess the current performance. # Set objectives and targets for the category. # Devise an overall Strategy. # Devise specific tactics. # Implementation. # The eighth step is one of review which takes us back to step 1. The 8-step process, whilst being very comprehensive and thorough has been criticized for being rather too unwieldy and time-consuming in today's fast-moving sales environment; in one survey only 9% of supplier companies stated they used the full 8-step process.9% of supplier companies admit to 8-step process The current industry trend is for supplier companies to use the standard process as a basis to develop their own more streamlined processes, tailored to their own particular products Structuring Your Marketing Framework For A Successful Omnichannel Campaign Market research company Nielsen has a similar process based on only 5 steps : reviewing the category, targeting consumers, planning merchandising, implementing strategy, evaluating results. Category captains It is commonplace for a particular supplier in a category to be nominated by the retailer as a category captain. The category captain will be expected to have the closest and most regular contact with the retailer and will also be expected to invest time, effort, and often financial assets into the strategic development of the category within the retailer. In return, the supplier will gain a more influential voice with the retailer. The category captain is often the supplier with the largest turnover in the category. Traditionally the job of category captain is given to a brand supplier, but in recent times the role has also gone to particularly switched-on private label suppliers.The role of Category Captain In order to do the job effectively, the supplier may be granted access to a greater wealth of data-sharing, e.g. more access to an internal sales database such as Walmart's Retail Link. In the UK, the Groceries Code Adjudicator found in her 2015-16 investigation into Tesco plc that some suppliers paid \\"large sums of money in exchange for category captaincy or participation in a price review\\". She found some evidence of benefits which suppliers derive from these arrangements but also recorded a concern, to be investigated further, as to whether the purpose of the Groceries Code was being circumvented by these payments.Groceries Code Adjudicator, Investigation into Tesco plc, published 26 January 2016 Governmental concerns about category management Many governments have viewed increased collaboration between suppliers and retailers as a potential source of antitrust breaches, such as price fixing. For example the UK Competition CommissionCompetition Commission has raised their issues on market distortion in principle. They have also acted on milk price-fixing in Britain.Milk Price Fixing Modified category management For MRP-based manufacturing industries, the predominant cost-saving methodology in category management (CM) involves the integration of market intelligence with leveraged spending (for a given category of product or service). In industries where asset operation and preservation bear more significance to the procurement process than do product manufacturing – such as in an MRO environment – demonstrable benefit can still be achieved with category management but is best approached with some manner of adjustment to CM’s usual processes for analysis and strategy development. The first challenge becomes incorporating analytical processes and value drivers that are largely indigenous to the MRP world in a manner that makes sense to an MRO environment. The second (and no less important) challenge becomes avoiding a trap where the CM processes are perceived to be more important than their outcome – a scenario that can result in significant analytical delay, and even complete process paralysis. An excellent example of an MRO environment warranting adjustment to classical category management is nuclear power generation in the United States, where the adjusted approach to category management has been coined \\"MCM\\" – standing for MRO-based Category Management or Modified Category Management. Not only does electricity generation epitomize an MRO-driven environment, the nuclear energy source adds numerous dimensions of supply and procurement complexity – including federal and state regulatory compliance, nuclear industry standards compliance, nuclear-unique system and component design, and a tightly-audited (and very small) supply base, amongst others. Due to the nature and quantity of discrete characteristics native to nuclear power generation, it can easily be argued that nuclear power generation, in and of itself, should be a distinct category of procurement within a category management project. The fundamental adjustment made between the classical category management approach and the nuclear MCM approach is a shift from procurement strategies focused on leveraged spending to procurement strategies embracing nuclear value drivers, technology innovation, risk management, and strategic sourcing.

The Cardinal Priest of the Titulus S. Andreae Apostoli de Hortis is Ennio Antonelli. History The current church was built over a pre-existing one, erected in 1192, called infra hortes (\\"amidst the orchards\\", whence the name fratte, \\"woods\\") for it was located in a countryside area on the northern edge of the inhabited area of medieval Rome. The church originally belonged to Augustinian nuns.\\"S.Andrea Della Fratte\\", Roma Segreta, February 6, 2016 It became the national church of the Scottish people in Rome, until Scotland became Protestant, when in 1585 Pope Sixtus V assigned it to the Minim friars of Saint Francis of Paola. The Scots College, the seminary for young men studying for the priesthood, was located nearby, on the Via del Tritone, until 1604, when it moved to the Via del Quattro Fontane. In 1942 Pope Pius XII elevated the church to the rank of a minor basilica.Parish of St. Andrew Fratte, Diocese of Rome Fabric of the Church In 1604 the construction of the new church was begun, to the design of Gaspare Guerra. The project, halted eight years later, was revamped in 1653 by Francesco Borromini, who is responsible of the apse, the tambour of the cupola,V. Zanchietti, \\"Il tiburio di Sant'Andrea delle Fratte: propositi e condizionamenti nel testo borrominiano,\\" Annali di archittetura 9 (1997), 112-135. and the square campanile with four orders. After his death, the construction was continued by Mattia De Rossi. The late Renaissance-style façade, with two orders divided by pilasters, was completed in 1826, thanks to funds provided the Testament of Cardinal Ercole Consalvi.Forcella, p. 238 no. 608. Interior The interior has a single nave. The decoration of the cupola is by Pasquale Marini. Along the nave in the first chapel is a wooden ‘’tempietto’’ (temple) (1674) painted by Borgognone and on the wall is a “Baptism of Christ” of Ludovico Gimignani. In the third chapel is the funeral monument of Cardinal Pierluigi Carafa sculpted by Pietro Bracci.Forcella, p. 233, no. 592. In the cloister, the lunettes are frescoed with stories from the Life of Saint Francesco by Marini, Francesco Cozza, and Filippo Gherardi. In the transept, the altar (1736) was designed by Filippo Barigioni, the altarpiece of Saint Francis of Paola was painted by Paris Nogari, the stuccoed angels were added by Giovanni Battista Maini. The presbytery dome has a fresco of the Multiplication of the loaves and fishes by Marini.

The altar in the left transept was designed by Luigi Vanvitelli and Giuseppe Valadier with an altarpiece of Saints Anne, Young John the Baptist, and Mary by Giuseppe Bottani. =Bernini's angels= At the sides of the presbytery are two angels (1667-1699) by Bernini, the \\"Angel with the Crown of Thorns\\" and the \\"Angel with the Scroll\\". They were originally intended for the Ponte Sant'Angelo, but Pope Clement IX considered them too valuable to be exposed to the elements and they were later moved here and replaced on the bridge with copies. In the third chapel on the left is a Madonna of the Miracle by Domenico Bartolini, to commemorate the place where, on 20 January 1842, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to a young Jewish man, Maria Alphonse Ratisbonne, leading him to convert to Catholicism. He later founded the Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion (Our Lady of Sion), a group of Catholic priests, lay brothers and Religious Sisters dedicated to work for the conversion of Jews to Catholicism. In honor of this apparition, the pews of the church are oriented to this altar. In 1950 the chapel was completely renovated by the architect Marcello Piacentini and enriched with precious marble.

It was known as Yatala South up until 1933, which was named for its local government area predecessor, the District Council of Yatala, and known as Enfield thereafter. The seat of the City of Enfield was the township of Enfield, approximately north of Adelaide's centre, named after Enfield Town in the London borough of same name. In 1868, the council area ranged approximately from Dry Creek in the north to the Torrens River in the south east and Torrens Road (unrelated to the river) in the south west. History =Early years= Map showing the boundaries of Yatala North and Yatala South immediately after the 1868 split, with relation to the Hundred of Yatala (shaded in green and yellow) and the Hundred of Port Adelaide (shaded in cyan and orange) The District Council of Yatala South was established on 18 June 1868 when the District Council of Yatala was divided at Dry Creek and the Dry Creek-Port Adelaide railway line into Yatala South and Yatala North. The council office was located near Gepps Cross intersection at the northern end of the suburb of Enfield. In August 1872 the District Council of Prospect was established by severance from Yatala South, reducing the latter in area by about . In 1927 the second Enfield council chamber, located on Regency Road, Enfield, pictured above, was erected. In 1930, the recorded population of Yatala South was 4,979. Well over half a century since its establishment, on 22 June 1933, Yatala South was renamed to be the District Council of Enfield following lobbying from residents. The district council was now named after its major population centre and council seat, the township of Enfield. =Municipality= In April 1944 the Enfield council was granted municipal status, becoming the Town of Enfield. In January 1953, the population had reached a point where the municipality was granted city status and known thereafter as the City of Enfield. The chairman of the council became the mayor from 1944.

The show is known for its satire of American popular culture and especially television culture, but has since its inception covered all types of media such as animation, journalism, commercials, comic books, movies, internet, and music. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town but the town of Springfield acts as a complete universe. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry. Most of The Simpsons media satire focuses on television. This is mainly done through three characters: Krusty the Clown, Sideshow Bob, and until 1998 Troy McClure. The Itchy & Scratchy Show is a show within a show, used as a satire of animation and in some cases The Simpsons itself. Topics include censorship, plagiarism, unoriginal writing, live-action clip shows and documentaries. Kent Brockman, Springfield's principal news presenter illustrates the glibness, amplification, and sensationalism of broadcast journalism. His tabloidization methods include making people look guilty without trial, and invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes.  Background  The Simpsons is known for its satire of American popular culture and especially television culture. It uses the standard setup of a situation comedy, or sitcom, as its premise and centers on a family and their life in a typical American town. However, its animated nature gives The Simpsons an unusually large scope. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. The town has a vast array of media channels—from children's television series to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry. On the radio, the citizens of Springfield have fictional radio stations such as KBBL-AM, KBBL-FM, KUDD, WKOMA, KJAZZ, KFSL, and WOMB. Using The Simpsons as an example of Media literacy education, Jonathan Gray discusses the role that television, and specifically television parody, might play in teaching the techniques and rhetoric of television to audiences.Jonathan Gray reveals his insights in a 2005 article called Television Teaching: Parody, The Simpsons, and Media Literacy Education. Several characters have a role in this satire. Krusty the Clown is a hard- living entertainment veteran, who has his own show: The Krusty the Klown Show, which is aimed towards a children's audience and has many followers, including Bart Simpson. He is sometimes depicted as a jaded, burned out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax. He instantly becomes depressed as soon as the cameras stop rolling; In his book Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as \\"the wizened veteran, the total pro\\" who lives the celebrity life but is miserable and needs his celebrity status. Krusty has been described as \\"the consummate showman who can't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people\\". His television shows are of mixed quality and all of his merchandise is of low quality, to the point of being potentially dangerous. While Krusty represents low culture, Sideshow Bob represents high culture. He began his career as the non-speaking sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show. Frustrated by his early role as the target of \\"Krusty's cheap gags\\", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that \\"Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents.\\" He also tries to \\"manipulate the tastes of the masses\\" by becoming a criminal mastermind. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a \\"mass-culture upbringing\\" and thus is Bob's enemy. Turner writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative Republican so that the writers can continually hit him with a rake and bring him down. Troy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been. He was a star in the early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of a paraphilia involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos and infomercials. Turner argues that \\"the smarmy Hollywood type...has been done to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the apotheosis of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction...has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure.\\" In addition to his in-story appearances, McClure appears as host of \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\" and \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\\". =Network notes= Back when The Simpsons was developed as a half hour show, co-creator James L. Brooks negotiated an unusual provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. He was able to do that, because Fox back then was a minor fledgling network. Former showrunner Bill Oakley considered working on the show to be similar to working in a bubble due to the lack of interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as showrunner Josh Weinstein commented: \\"The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high- concept ones like 'Two Bad Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us.\\" Network notes were parodied at the beginning of the episode \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\". Krusty is shown being pestered by network executives who comment on every choice he makes. He announces his departure of The Krusty the Klown Show after the executives give him notes during filming of a sketch. At the end of the episode, Mr. Teeny is uncertain of where he should throw the plastic explosives that Bart wore. When he sees the two executives discussing in a room, he throws it onto them. Instead of dying of the explosion however, the pieces of the executives reconstitute into what Jean describes as a \\"super-executive\\". These sequences were inspired by Jean's dissatisfaction with some network executives, who he felt took control over a television series he was working on before he returned to The Simpsons in 1999. \\"I had just worked on a show on another network [...] we had a show where there were a lot of notes from executives\\", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes. In \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" The Simpsons writers mocks the notion of network executives forcing ideas onto a show. The interaction between the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them. The writers understand the show's inner workings, but the network executives' approach improvements to the show from a business point- of-view. They try to incorporate what they see as a rebellious character into a failing television show with the comment \\"This is popular with the kids\\", but the viewers later reject the character. The Fox network itself is often the target of jokes. In \\"Missionary: Impossible\\" the episode cuts away from the main story near the end to a telethon, populated by Bender (from Futurama), Thurgood Stubbs (from The PJs), Hank Hill (from King of the Hill), Luke Perry (Dylan in Beverly Hills, 90210), David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (Mulder and Scully from The X-files), and the owner of the Fox network Rupert Murdoch. The host, Betty White, tells the viewers \\"So if you don't want to see crude, lowbrow programming disappear from the airwaves ... please call now\\". In \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase,\\" Troy McClure explains that the Fox network had approached the producers of The Simpsons to create \\"thirty-five new shows to fill a few holes in their programming line-up\\". He then shows the viewers a weekly programming schedule consisting of only The Simpsons, The X-files, and Melrose Place surrounded by question marks. Matt Groening notes in an interview that The Simpsons is in a unique place, and when former producers/writers move to different networks, they are told that \\"We would never have The Simpsons on our network\\". On this issue Robert Sloane concludes in Leaving Springfield that \\"In sum, the show seems to defy certain industry practices.\\" Television =Unoriginal writing= The episode \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\\" was a satire over unoriginal, poor television writing and references and parodies many TV shows. The episode features three spin-off ideas for The Simpsons show, which also functions as a critique of spin-offs in general. Troy McClure introduces the three spin-offs as a host of the episode, something he had previously done in the episode \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\". Creator Matt Groening was uneasy about the idea, feeling that it could be mistranslated as actually poor sitcom writing. He also did not like the idea of breaking the fourth wall and the concept of saying that the Simpsons were just actors in a television show. The three segments were: * Chief Wiggum, P.I. is a parody of police-dramas, such as Miami Vice, Magnum, P.I. and Starsky & Hutch. Seymour Skinner emulates Don Johnson from Miami Vice in order to look scruffier. * The Love-matic Grampa is a parody of fantasy sitcoms such as Mister Ed, I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched as well as having similarities to My Mother the Car. The segment demanded a different approach to directing than a usual The Simpsons episode. Director Neil Affleck had to emulate a three-camera setup, as is normally used in sitcoms. * The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is a parody of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is a parody of The Brady Bunch Hour, a short-lived spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is made to look like The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Catchphrase-based humor was mocked in the episode \\"Bart Gets Famous\\". The writers chose the phrase \\"I didn't do it\\" because they wanted a \\"lousy\\" phrase \\"to point out how really crummy things can become really popular\\". It was also an intentional call back to the first season episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" where it was a catchphrase of Krusty the Clown. When people in the episode eventually got tired of the catchphrase \\"I didn't do it\\", Lisa tells Bart that now \\"you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase\\". The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, Ned Flanders, Nelson Muntz, Mr. Burns and Barney Gumble. The episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\" was a parody of the music documentary series Behind the Music, which was popular during the episode's production. It tells the fictional history of the Simpson family and how they got into show business; from their weak beginnings to their exceptional prosperity. A television show, a recording contract, a lot of awards, and countless wealth follow Homer's inadequate video \\"pilot\\". It took the writers a long time to conceptualize the show, as they were unsure whether to make Homer a filmmaker or make the characters unaware they were being filmed. The writers had particular fun writing over the top, melodramatic lines \\"tortured metaphors,\\" many of which were penned by producer David Mirkin. Part of the imitating of Behind the Music was using the \\"corny, stock interstitial footage to amp up the drama of the situation\\". In the clip show \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\", the entire setup of Troy McClure presenting the episode is a parody of the practice by live-action series to produce clip shows in general. The parody was done by celebrating a completely random milestone and by making exaggerated use of the conventions of traditional highlight shows, such as a grand introduction and relentlessly showbizzy host. Considered a spoof of television clip shows, the episode is seen drawing attention to prevailing televisual conventions and reminds viewers that The Simpsons itself participates actively in that same cultural legacy. Simone Knox referred to it in her article Reading the Ungraspable Double-Codedness of \\"The Simpsons\\" as not simply a clip show, \\"but a ‘clip show’ that looks at the series with a sense of hyper-self-consciousness about its own textuality\\". Since \\"Gump Roast\\", there have not been any more clip shows. The show now instead produces episodes with three adaptations of existing stories for each act, called \\"trilogy episodes\\", rendering a clip show unnecessary. =Self reflectivity= One of the goals of showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein was to create several episodes in each season which would \\"push the envelope conceptually\\". The idea for the episode \\"Homer's Enemy\\" was first conceived by Oakley who thought that Homer should have an enemy. The thought evolved into the concept of a \\"real world\\" co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Grimes, a man who had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it, and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. \\"Homer's Enemy\\" explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In an essay for the book Leaving Springfield, Robert Sloane describes the episode as \\"an incisive consideration of The Simpsons's world. Although The Simpsons is known for its self-reflectivity, the show had never looked at (or critiqued) itself as directly as it does in [\\"Homer's Enemy\\"].\\" In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering \\"real American hero,\\" is relegated to the role of antagonist; it is intended that the viewer be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. The episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\" is also largely self- referential. A series of T-shirts are shown sporting a number of Bart Simpson catchphrases: \\"You bet your sweet bippy, man.\\" \\"Life begins at conception, man.\\" These are parodies of both officially licensed and bootleg Simpsons- themed T-shirts in the early days of the series, usually revolving around Bart. The famous scene of Homer plummeting off the jagged cliffs after trying to jump Springfield Gorge on Bart's skateboard from the season two episode \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" is shown, however, \\"Behind the Laughter\\" shows us the \\"unfunny aftermath\\" of Homer going through physical rehabilitation and becoming addicted to pain pills. The episode states the series turned to \\"gimmicky premises and nonsensical plots\\" as ratings dipped, and uses a clip from the season nine episode \\"The Principal and the Pauper\\" to get that point across: a highly controversial episode that many fans and critics panned. \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" mainly deals with themes commonly known as \\"jumping the shark,\\" instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or twist to boost ratings. Before production of season eight began, Fox executives suggested the staff to add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis. The staff, amused with the idea, decided to write this episode as a commentary on what it was like to work on a television show that had been on the air for several years. Parallel to Poochie being introduced on Itchy & Scratchy, they inserted the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was there, as a reference to the executive's proposal. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involves children who have grown up. This was the case in \\"Oliver\\" in The Brady Bunch or \\"Luke\\" on Growing Pains. The episode was intended to be a commentary on what it was like to work on a television show that had been on the air for a long time but was nearing its end. It was intended to show that The Simpsons could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the \\"shock value\\" it did in the early years. The Simpsons would, in a later episode \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase,\\" mock the addition of The Great Gazoo into some of the final episodes of The Flintstones by stating that, in future episodes, Homer would meet a green space alien named Ozmodiar that only he can see. =Commercialism= Television advertisements are also parodied. As an example there is a song and visual sequence in the episode \\"The Last Temptation of Krust\\" that was modeled after Ford commercials. The sequence is a parody of a commercial for a sport utility vehicle, and Hank Williams Jr. sings a song about the fictional \\"Canyonero\\" accompanied by country guitar music and whip cracks. The song \\"Canyonero\\" closely resembles the theme to the 1960s television series Rawhide. The first verse of the song is: \\"Can you name the car with a four-wheel drive / Smells like a steak and seats thirty-five? / Canyonero! / Canyonero!\\" Turner wrote positively of the Canyonero spoof piece in Planet Simpson, calling it \\"a brilliant parody of an SUV ad\\". In an article in the journal Environmental Politics Steve Vanderheiden commented that the Canyonero reflected an \\"anti-SUV\\" stance by The Simpsons. In an article in the San Francisco Chronicle about SUV owners, Vicki Haddock wrote \\"SUV owners have become something of a punch line, succinctly captured in a \\"Simpsons\\" parody touting the apocryphal Canyonero [...]\\" In his book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray analyses a scene from the episode \\"Girly Edition\\" in which it is announced that Kidz News has been replaced by the children's cartoon The Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Chocobot Hour (a reference to the Mattel toys and the Mars chocolate bar). He says this mocks \\"how many children's programs have become little more than the ad to the merchandise\\". Gray also writes that The Simpsons \\"illustrates how the ad as genre has itself already invaded many, if not all, genres. Ads and marketing do not limit themselves to the space between programs; rather, they are themselves textual invaders, and part of The Simpsons parodic attack on ads involves revealing their hiding places in other texts.\\" Animation The Itchy & Scratchy Show is a show within a show that appears occasionally in episodes of The Simpsons. They typically appear in the form of 15-60 second cartoons that are filled with over-the-top violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat; Itchy is almost always the victor. The show is usually a parody of traditional cartoons or takeoffs on famous films, but the plot and content are always violent. The most direct and obvious example is Tom and Jerry, an animated series which was also about a constant battle between a cat and a mouse, with the mouse usually victorious. Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are often added when a show needs expanding or when there is an issue that the writers wish to satirize. In some cases, notably in \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\", the writers use Itchy & Scratchy as a way to comment on The Simpsons. Several episodes that centered on Itchy and Scratchy dealt with censorship issues. In the episode \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\", Marge successfully forms a protest group that forces network to take Itchy and Scratchy off the air, citing the cartoon violence unsuitable for children. The episode was partially inspired by Terry Rakolta, who protested the Fox network over the show Married... with Children. When Itchy and Scratchy are cancelled, the kids of Springfield resort to playing in a wholesome manner. The montage was a satirical point by saying the opposite of what the writers believed. For the episode, which handles a large issue, the writers tried not to have a point of view and looked at both sides, despite what the writers personally felt. The episode \\"Itchy & Scratchy Land\\" was written as a response to new, more stringent censorship laws that had been put in place. As a result, the Fox network tried to stop the writers from including Itchy & Scratchy cartoons in episodes. In response, the writers created this episode, which they decided would be as violent as possible. The network threatened that if the episode was produced, they would cut the Itchy & Scratchy parts out themselves, but relented when showrunner David Mirkin threatened to tell the media. Mirkin further tried to put \\"as much blood and guts\\" into the episode \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\" as he could. He had received several complaints by the United States Congress about the amount of violence on the show and he did not like their attempt to censor it. The episode was later described as \\"the most [...] disturbing Halloween show ever\\" by Mirkin. The episode begins with Marge warning that the episode that is about to air has so much guts and violence that Congress will not let them show it. The three main segments are linked with Groundskeeper Willie being killed in all three of them. The first segment has Homer attempting to kill the rest of the family, the second segment has Homer killing anything and everything in the prehistoric past, and the final segment revolves around Springfield Elementary eating children. To top it off, the Simpsons do a song and dance number, with their insides turned inside out, over the closing credits. The Itchy & Scratchy Show-related episode \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" functioned as a vehicle for jokes about animation and plagiarism. In the episode, the owner of the Itchy and Scratchy characters is accused of fraud, when the original authorship of the characters comes into question. When the owner pleads his case in court, he mentions that several animated television series and characters were plagiarized from other series and characters: \\"Animation is built on plagiarism! If it weren't for someone plagiarizing The Honeymooners, we wouldn't have The Flintstones. If someone hadn't ripped off Sergeant Bilko, there'd be no Top Cat!. Huckleberry Hound, Chief Wiggum, Yogi Bear? Andy Griffith, Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney!\\" Journalism The character Kent Brockman functions as The Simpsonss main character for news parodies. He was based on Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy, and modeled after anchorman Ted Koppel. Another influence on the character was The Mary Tyler Moore Show's Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. His role on The Simpsons is to host the news as the fictional television channel, Channel 6's anchorman. In addition to the news, he also hosts the programs Eye on Springfield and Smartline. Brockman is joined by Scott Christian and Arnie Pie on the Channel 6 news team. Originally, Scott Christian was the anchor and Brockman was the field reporter, but the show shifted focus to Brockman. Arnie Pie is a helicopter-based traffic reporter that sometimes help with field reports other than traffic. In most of his appearances, Brockman seems more interested in entertaining the viewers than informing them of real news. In \\"Homer Loves Flanders\\" Brockman calls the United States Army a \\"kill-bot factory\\" in a news broadcast. Mirkin said this was a joke the staff \\"particularly loved to do\\" because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly \\"always trying to scare everybody\\" by creating panic and depression. Turner said that \\"in Brockman's journalism, we see some of the modern news media's ugliest biases\\", of which he says are glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors. A real-life journalist named Reid, who Gray interviewed for his book, states that the episode \\"Girly Edition\\" mirrors well how some journalists actually work. She said the episode shows \\"the ludicrous nature of, you know, what we do in a lot of things. The kids news with Bart and Lisa: I mean, you see them do really stupid stories about the news, and 'news you can use,' and 'how to get rid of your sheets when you wet them.' I mean, people really do stories like that.\\" Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that \\"the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do have an impact on the minds of many intelligent members of American society.\\" With that said, the episode parodies the relationship between hard and intelligent journalism championed by Lisa and the \\"Up Close and Personal\\" style preferred by Bart. Similar to the show's parody of the Fox network, The Simpsons also makes jokes about Fox News. Near the beginning of the episode \\"The Fool Monty\\", a Fox News helicopter can be seen, with the slogan \\"Fox News: Not Racist, But #1 With Racists\\". Bill O'Reilly, host of the Fox News show The O'Reilly Factor, aired the clip during the show's \\"Pinheads and Patriots\\" segment, saying \\"Continuing to bite the hand that feeds part of it, Fox broadcasting once again allows its cartoon characters to run wild.\\" After the clip aired, he said \\"Pinheads? I believe so.\\" In response, the producers added a brief scene at the beginning of the opening sequence of the following episode with a helicopter that bears the slogan \\"Fox News: Unsuitable for Viewers Under 75.\\" According to showrunner Al Jean, the producers of the show were pleased that they had annoyed O'Reilly, and that they had never received a warning from Fox about making jokes about the network. He added, \\"Both ends of it benefit the ultimate News Corp. agenda,” Jean said. “We’re happy to have a little feud with Bill O’Reilly. That’s a very entertaining thing for us.\\" Other journalistic media are satirized as well. \\"Homer Badman\\" is a satire of shows like Hard Copy. David Mirkin, the show runner at the time, felt very strongly about the \\"tabloidization of the media\\" and has said that the episode is as current today as it was at the time and things have since gotten worse. Several gags in the episode are based on what real life shows like Hard Copy would do, such as making people look to be guilty without a trial as well as a complete invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes. The talk show \\"Ben\\" reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience. This leads to Homer using public access TV to try to clear his name. The character Birch Barlow, who hosts a conservative radio talk show in Springfield, is a take-off of American talk show host and political commentator Rush Limbaugh. Springfield has its own local newspaper, The Springfield Shopper. The newspaper is often isolated from mainstream media, so the characters do not seem to know of other ones. Dave Shutton is a reporter for The Springfield Shopper. He became less used since the episode \\"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\\" and has been reduced to cameo appearances and appearances in crowd scenes. Other newspapers are seldom mentioned on the show. In his book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray discusses a scene from \\"Homer Defined\\" that shows Homer reading a USA Today with the cover story: \\"America's Favorite Pencil – #2 is #1\\". Lisa sees this title and criticizes the newspaper as a \\"flimsy hodge-podge of high-brass factoids and Larry King\\", to which Homer responds that it is \\"the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine.\\" In the book, Gray says this scene is used by the show's producers to criticize \\"how often the news is wholly toothless, sacrificing journalism for sales, and leaving us not with important public information, but with America's Favorite Pencil\\". Internet Four months after the airing of a first episode \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", the newsgroup alt.tv.simpsons was created by Gary D. Duzan during the third week of March 1990. It was created before there was a world wide web, which emerged in 1993, so those earliest discussions were held on text-only platforms. According to Turner, the newsgroup was among the most trafficked newsgroups of the early 1990s. The comments of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or cited in the writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, Simpsons creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other showrunners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, \\"Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic noggins together\\". Showrunner Bill Oakley used to respond to select Simpsons fans through e-mail in a friendly manner, but by 1996 claimed \\"[t]here are people who take it seriously to the point of absurdity\\". The writers often use the character Comic Book Guy to satirize and respond to the alt.tv.simpsons community. In this scene he is logging on to alt.nerd.obsessive, a parody of alt.tv.simpsons. The writers sometimes make jokes at the newsgroup's expense. Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of alt.tv.simpsons. The first such instance occurred in the seventh season episode \\"Radioactive Man\\", in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive. Comic Book Guy's oft-repeated catchphrase, \\"Worst episode ever\\", first appeared on alt.tv.simpsons in an episode review and writer David S. Cohen decided to use this fan response to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans. In the chapter \\"Who Wants Candy\\" in the book Leaving Springfield, Robert Sloane finds alt.tv.simpsons an example of an \\"active audience ... who struggle to make their own meaning out of the show\\". He mentions that in this context, the fans nitpick the show to an extreme and allow no room for error, where the writers believe that nitpicking leads to an under appreciation of the show's qualities. Turner writes in the book Planet Simpson that The Simpsons appeared tailor-made for a newsgroup in the early 1990s because it includes minor details that reward attentive viewing and can be easily scrutinized. The episode \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\" deals with the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency. When the character Comic Book Guy saw that the television show The Itchy & Scratchy Show added a new character, called Poochie, he immediately goes on the internet and writes \\"Worst episode ever\\" on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nit picks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart: In 2011, the producers let the users of the Internet vote over what direction The Simpsons should take. In the twenty-second season finale \\"The Ned-Liest Catch\\", the characters Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel started dating. The episode ends with Homer and Marge Simpson giving the viewers a link to the official The Simpsons website, TheSimpsons.com, and encouraging them to go on the website and vote over the summer of 2011 on whether Ned and Edna should stay together. Showrunner Al Jean said in an interview that the writers decided it would not be interesting for them to do another episode where a relationship ended, and they thought it would be interesting \\"to see what people think, [...] the Internet certainly has a lot of opinion on the show, might as well have them have their say.\\" When asked why the writers thought Ned and Edna were the right characters for a cliffhanger like this, Jean said that \\"In life, unusual things happen. People couple together in ways you would not expect, and he's single and she's single. We thought it would be funny, the fact that they both have these connections to the Simpsons but they never really met or if they have met it was minimal.\\" The result of the poll was revealed in the season 23 premiere \\"The Falcon and the D'ohman\\". According to Jean, the poll was \\"very strong in one direction\\". He assured in an interview before the result was presented that the poll was authentic and the writers would not undo the viewers' decision, and added that \\"What our fans have joined together, let no writer tear asunder.\\" \\"I Am Furious (Yellow)\\" references the dot-com bubble, a speculative bubble covering roughly 1995–2000. In their article \\"15 Simpsons Moments That Perfectly Captured Their Eras\\", The A.V. Club wrote: \\"By April 2002, the dot-com bubble of the late '90s had been popped for a couple of years, taking with it myriad Internet start-ups. A sobering soul-searching settled in their place, which The Simpsons captured in this episode about Bart creating a popular Internet cartoon called Angry Dad. Touring the laid-back start-up that hosts the cartoons, Lisa asks head honcho Todd Linux about their business model. 'How many shares of stock will it take to end this conversation?' he retorts. Lisa asks for two million, which Linux grabs from a paper-towel dispenser. When Bart and Lisa return later, the company has gone bust, and Linux is stealing copper wire out of the walls.\\" The episode was also partly based on some of The Simpsons staff members' experience with making internet cartoons, such as Queer Duck and Hard Drinkin' Lincoln, both of which were created by former showrunner Mike Reiss. In his article \\"Best Indicator Ever: The Simpsons Foreclosure\\", Jonathan Hoenig of SmartMoney wrote that the twentieth season episode \\"No Loan Again, Naturally\\", an episode in which the Simpsons are foreclosed from their house, could have indicated that \\"the worst of the housing crisis\\" at the time the article was written, was over. Hoenig based this theory on the fact that shortly after \\"I Am Furious (Yellow)\\", which satirizes the dot-com bubble, aired, the dotcom stocks \\"began a massive rebound from bear-market lows\\". In the episode \\"The Computer Wore Menace Shoes\\", Homer buys a computer and creates his own website to spread fake news. He defends his action towards Bart by stating \\"Real news is great, son, but I'm getting a thousand hits an hour with Grade A bull plop\\". In his review of The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that he enjoyed the episode's take on \\"Internet idiocy\\". He wrote, \\"Some parts of it feel dated, but the web features even more ill- informed opinions today than it did nine years ago, so much of it remains timeless and on target.\\" Films Rainier Wolfcastle is an action hero star and a close parody of actor/bodybuilder/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger. The writers invented Wolfcastle as the action hero McBain for the episode \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" and the McBain films were meant to satirize clichés of action movies. In the episode \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\", Bart Simpson tells Wolfcastle that his \\"last movie really sucked\\" with Chief Wiggum adding \\"Magic Ticket, my ass, McBain!\\", alluding to Schwarzenegger's film Last Action Hero, which was panned by critics. Wolfcastle owns a restaurant named Planet Springfield, a parody of Planet Hollywood, which Schwarzenegger co-owned with other celebrities. The episode \\"Radioactive Man\\" sees the film version of the comic book series Radioactive Man set up production in Springfield with Wolfcastle starring as the title role. Radioactive Man is a fictional superhero within The Simpsons, who works as a parody of comic books and superheroes in general. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a \\"wonderful pastiche\\" on the Tim Burton Batman films, and several scenes in the episode reference the Batman television series from the 1960s. In the later episode \\"Homer the Whopper\\", writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg wanted to show how Hollywood generally ruins superhero films. He said that \\"the whole joke is that Homer is cast to play a guy who's an everyman and they try to make him into this physically fit guy.\\" Rogen also noted that the plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet, when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role. Showrunner Al Jean commented that the writers tried not to repeat the comic book film theme from the \\"Radioactive Man\\" episode. Instead they decided to parody the fact that almost every comic book has been turned into a film. Jean commented that that scene in the episode in which the studio executives \\"are trying to think up an idea that hasn't been done really is what they are doing these days [in real life]\\". In the season eleven episode \\"E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)\\", The Simpsons go to a screening of The Poke of Zorro, which is largely a parody of the Zorro film The Mask of Zorro (1998). Jonathan Gray wrote in Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality that The Poke of Zorro \\"ridicules the outlandishness of Hollywood blockbuster fare,\\" especially its \\"blatant historical inaccuracies\\" which sees the film feature Zorro, King Arthur, the Three Musketeers, the Scarlet Pimpernel, \\"the Man in the Iron Mask and ninjas in nineteenth century Mexico\\". The Buzz Cola advertisement shown before The Poke of Zorro is a parody of the opening Normandy invasion sequence from the film Saving Private Ryan (1998). Gray writes that it \\"scorns the proclivity of ads to use any gimmick to grab attention, regardless of the ethics: as an indignant Lisa asks incredulously, 'Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?'\\" Music Michael Dunne analyzed the episode \\"All Singing, All Dancing\\" in his book American Film Musical Themes and Forms, and gave examples from it while explaining that singing and dancing performances are generally not seen as acceptable in the television medium. He notes that Homer calls singing \\"fruity\\" and \\"the lowest form of communication\\" during the episode. However, Dunne also notes the fact that Homer himself sings \\"his objection that musicals are fake and phony\\". Dunne describes the frame narrative as establishing Marge as \\"..more favorably disposed toward musicals than the males in her house\\". Dunne concluded that \\"musicals come out on top in this episode, but the victory is marginal at best.\\" Of the episode itself, Dunne wrote that \\"..the parodies contained in the show demonstrate that its creators are familiar enough with various forms of musical performance to echo them and confident enough that their viewers will catch the references.\\" In the episode \\"The Springfield Connection\\", Homer and Marge went to an outdoor performance by the Springfield Pops orchestra. The orchestra plays the theme to the Star Wars films, and Homer mistakenly believes that the theme's composer John Williams is dead, complaining: \\"Laser effects, mirrored balls--John Williams must be rolling around in his grave!\\". Kurt M. Koenigsberger analyzes Homer's comments in his piece: \\"Commodity Culture and Its Discontents: Mr. Bennett, Bart Simpson, and the Rhetoric of Modernism\\" published in the compilation work Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture edited by John Alberti. Koenigsberger comments: \\"The joke in this opening scene involves a confusion of high and popular artistic production: Marge treats the Springfield Pops as 'culture' and expects that the usually boorish Homer will need to be drawn into the spectacle.\\" However, Koenigsberger notes that Homer actually regards Star Wars as a \\"classic\\", implying that a \\"classic\\" work must have a musical composer that is deceased, and be devoid of light-shows or glitter balls. Koenigsberger uses this example to discuss Homer's application of \\"a strategy characteristic of literary modernism\\".

The film starred Vikram and Abitha in the lead roles. The score and soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film was initially released in a single suburban theater in October 1999, but later became a popular commercial success, as Vikram's breakthrough film. Sethu won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, and the Best Film category at the Filmfare Awards and the Cinema Express Awards. Bala and Vikram also won several awards for their contributions to the film. The film was remade in Hindi as Tere Naam, in Kannada as Huchcha, in Telugu as Seshu, in Bangladesh as Tor Karone Beche Achi, and Odia as Rakate Lekhichi Na.  Plot  Sethu, aka Chiyaan, is a rough and macho college student, and the Chairman of the college's Student Union. He deals with people violently and has a bad temper. He lives with his older brother, a magistrate, and his sister-in-law, who is the only person who seems to understand him. The movie opens with Sethu winning the Chair of the Students' Union election, followed by celebrations and an on-campus fight between the rival candidates. Sethu is shown to have an entourage of loyal friends. He comes across a timid girl, Abitha, who is the daughter of a poor temple priest, and attempts to win her over. When she initially rejects him, he kidnaps her and lures her into falling in love with him. After Abitha falls for him, Sethu is attacked by brothel goons who take revenge on him for interfering in their business. Sethu suffers brain damage as a result and ends up in a temple ashram. He now suffers from amnesia and shows a marked change in his personality, but he slowly begins to recollect his past life. At one point, he is completely back to his normal self and tries to persuade the Swamiji he is fully recovered and can be released. However, Swamiji ignores him and the wardens beat him up. A desperate Sethu attempts to escape from the ashram by climbing over the gates, but he fails and obtains serious injuries. Whilst Sethu is sleeping, Abitha pays him a surprise visit and is distraught to see him in such a condition. As she is about to leave the institution, he wakes up and realizes she had come to see him. He calls out, but she leaves unable to hear him. Determined to meet her, he makes another attempt to escape the institution, and this time is successful, but when he arrives at her house he finds Abhita has killed herself. Sethu is delirious with grief and heartbreak. His friends and family try to help him regain his composure but Sethu pretends to be unconscious and is met by the mental institution's wardens who have come to take him back to the ashram. The film ends with Sethu leaving with them as he has nothing left to live for after his true love's death.

He then chose J. D. Chakravarthy as the lead in the film. He liked the script but was unable to sign the film as he was busy with another project. The film is based on a real-life incident of a friend of Bala's, who had fallen in love, lost his mind and ended up at a mental asylum. Murali was then also considered for the lead role in the project, but did not sign up. In 1997, debutant director Bala offered Vikram the role of Sethu. Keerthi Reddy was initially signed on to play the lead female role, but was later replaced by Rajshri and then subsequently Abitha. To prepare for the character, Vikram shaved his head, thinned down to half his size by losing 21 kilograms and grew out his nails. Bala did not want Vikram to accept any other offers during this period to maintain the continuity of his looks and asked him to cease working as a dubbing artist. The film's launch was held in April 1997, and production lasted close to two years as the film languished in a development hell. The FEFSI strike of 1997 halted filming across the Tamil film industry from June to December 1997, and as a small budget film, Sethu was unable to progress during the period. When the strike was called off, the producer left the project and Vikram and Bala's assistant, Ameer, pled with the producer to return, with filming resuming in January 1998. After further slow progression, the film was finally completed in June 1999. M. S. Bhaskar lent his voice for S. S. Raman who appeared as temple priest in this film. Rathnavelu, who worked as a cameraman, said he gave the asylum scenes a predominantly green tone for the intense psychological impact. Vikram has described the period of production as \\"the worst phase of his career\\", as he was weak economically, and \\"his fire was in danger of dying down\\".  Release  The film struggled to find a distributor and only after sixty-seven screenings did the film manage to find a buyer, with most refusing the film due to its tragic climax. At that time, Bala and Vikram used money from Vikram's wife, Shailaja, to organize press previews. Despite garnering good reviews, no one was interested in purchasing the film and it remained finished but unreleased. Made on a shoestring budget, Sethu was a sleeper hit grossing almost 4 crore ($560,000) at the box office. The film was released on December 10, 1999, and initially began running at a single noon show in a suburban theatre, but gradually built up audiences through word-of-mouth publicity. The film ran over 100 days at several cinema halls across Chennai, with Vikram being mobbed by people on the streets as a result of the film's success. Critics lapped up Vikram's performance with the reviewer Easwaran Haricharan of Indolink stating, \\"Vikram is a revelation\\". Similarly, a critic from the New Straits Times described the film as an \\"unforgettable experience\\" and described Vikram's performance as \\"praise-worthy\\". The following year, Sethu won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, while also securing wins in the Best Film category at the Filmfare Awards and the Cinema Express Awards. Bala won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director and the Filmfare Award for Best Director – Tamil for his directorial debut. The performance also drew accolades for Vikram who won the Filmfare Special Award – South and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his portrayal of the title character, he was nominated for the National Film Award for Best Actor but lost to Mohanlal. Post-success, Vikram has said the film would have been close to him regardless of the commercial success, and it put him on the \\"right path\\", with Vikram choosing to adopt the prefix of Chiyaan to his screen name. Owing to its success, the film was remade in Hindi as Tere Naam starring Salman Khan which became a success, and also in Kannada as Huchcha which gave a major breakthrough to actor Sudeep. Jeevitha then remade the film in Telugu as Seshu with her husband Rajasekhar playing the lead.  Legacy  The film was a milestone in the career of Vikram. The success of the film made Bala one of the most sought after directors in the industry. The film continued the trend of films with themes that focused on realism and nativity. K. Jeshi, a journalist for The Hindu, placed it in the category of films which propagates social issues, like Kaadhal (2004), Veyil (2006), Mozhi (2007) and Paruthiveeran (2007). Sethu was parodied in various films. In a comedy scene from Alli Thandha Vaanam (2001), Vivek, who acted as a Tamil teacher, would lie in a similar way as Vikram while the song \\"Enge Sellum Indha Paadhai\\" played in the background.Allithandha Vaanam DVD The scene where Vikram kidnaps and threatens Abitha to accept his love was imitated by Vadivelu in Style (2002).Style DVD In Ragasiyamai (2003), Karunas who appears as a barber, shows a customer (who asked for the same hairstyle of Kuruthipunal Kamal) another of his customers is lying in a position similar to Vikram from Sethu.Ragasiyamai DVD  Soundtrack  The soundtrack album and background score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The lyrics were written by Arivumathi, Palani Bharathi, Mu Metha, and Ilaiyaraaja.

Among those she carried to Normandy was the actor David Niven. After landing her troops, Empire Battleaxe returned to the United Kingdom to collect a second wave of troops. Empire Battleaxe was then commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Empire Battleaxe. In August 1944, HMS Empire Battleaxe was sent to the Pacific as part of Force X. She sailed in a convoy of seven ships comprising , , HMS Empire Battleaxe, , , and .

After the war ended she was returned to the Ministry of Transport in 1946, her name reverting to Empire Battleaxe. During this time, Empire Battleaxe was employed on trooping duties in the Mediterranean. In July 1946, the crew were told that on arrival at Naples, Italy from Alexandria, Egypt, the ship would sail for Liverpool, United Kingdom. However, on arrival at Naples, orders were received to make another return trip to Alexandria. About three-quarters of her crew refused to sail. The British Consul in Naples visited the ship to warn the strikers of the consequences of their actions. After he had departed, new orders were issued to sail to Liverpool. The explanation given was that the original orders had been issued because it was thought that ships being sent to relieve Empire Battleaxe would not reach Naples in time. Once it was realised that the relief would arrive in time, the order was cancelled. She was returned to the United States Maritime Commission in 1947 and renamed Cape Berkeley in 1948. It was then proposed to sell her to China, where she was to be named Hai C. The sale was subsequently cancelled. She was renamed Empire Battleaxe in 1950 and laid up in the James River, Virginia.

They live around the Tabi Hills, southwest of Ad- Damazin and northwest of Kurmuk in the Blue Nile Province. The capital of the Ingessena area is Bao (11.350797,34.083710) and the government offices are in Soda.  Subgroups  There are 4 major subgroups of the Ingessana: the Jok Kulelek, the Jok Bulek, the Jok Gor, and the Jok Tau. Each of the major subgroups of the Ingessana has an economic specialisation: the Jok Kulelek own great heards of livestock, the Jok Bulek are known for their farming capabilities, the Jok Gor are skilled weavers and the Jok Tau specialise as blacksmiths and iron workers.  History  As Jedrej (1995) explains, the Gaahmg (Ingessana) have historically protected themselves and their hills from many invasions of outsiders. As a result, their culture is much more resistant to change than that of other ethnic groups of the Southern Blue Nile region. Mainly self-sustaining in what they cultivate in the hill area, the Gaahmg are slow to grow cash crops or to migrate for wages. As a result of past conflict with Arabs and other invaders, they have a reputation of being hostile towards strangers and even refugees. Although the origins of the Gaahmg are unclear, the Ingessena hills were alternately raided for several hundred years by the Funj sultans of Sennar to the northwest or by the Abyssinian kings of Gondar to the northeast, the Ingessena hills being a borderland between these kingdoms that plundered for slaves and gold. The Dinka and Nuer to the southwest raided the Gaahmg for cattle during times of drought or flooding in their own areas. From 1820-1855, the ruling Turk-Egyptian Empire demanded heavy tribute of slaves and gold. When they did not receive their demands, they attacked and imprisoned the Gaahmg, taking several hundred prisoners at a time. The Gaahmg fought back with speed and surprise attacks, causing many attacks of the Empire to be unsuccessful. In 1888-1889, the Mahdi government raided the Funj area and the Ingessena hills in particular, to provide for Khartoum during a severe and widespread famine, taking 1000 head of cattle from the Gaahmg on one occasion. The Gaahmg made counter attacks and held Arabs captive for ransom at ten head of cattle per person. From 1903-1934, the Anglo-Egyptian Government was less brutal but continued the same pattern of collecting tribute and squelching resistance. When the Gaahmg attacked tax patrols in protest to tribute collections, the Anglo-Egyptian government conducted ‘military operations’ which, although they did not involve taking slaves, seized livestock and killed those deemed responsible.  Lifestyle  The main occupations of the Gaahmg relate to livestock, cultivation, or craftmaking. In particular, the Gaahmg grow sorghum, sesame, maize, peppers, gourds, and tobacco. They keep cattle, goats, pigs, sheep, hens, donkeys, mules, and camels. During the dry season, young men and boys take herds of up to 50 head of cattle a hundred miles south to the Yabus River for water and pasture. The Gaahmg are also famous for their throwing knives, called koleth. There are two types of these, called \\"Sai\\" and \\"Muder\\".The designs on the blade are fixed and different for both the varieties. The \\"Muder\\" features a scorpion (deit) on the left side and an insect called fil on the other. Fil is a water insect and often stings people who are bathing but the pain is slight relative to that inflicted by a scorpion. The \\"Sai\\" also carries two creatures from nature, the snake (der) and the spider (maras) Both are represented on each side of the blade and spider four times in all,twice on each side. The shank and hilt of each variety are engraved with either pairs of small incisions (representing the footprints of a small deer, mofor) or parallel zig-zag lines called 'the millipede' (dongole) and sometimes combinations of both. The design here reflects the preference of the client or smith. There are reported to be 78 hills in the area, some rising 300 meters above the surrounding flat plains. While the plains are grassland with occasional acacia trees, the vegetation in the hills has a much greater variety of plants and trees, with water sources even in the dry season. Their traditional religion is thought to be based on worship of the Sun, but there is a distinction from the physical phenomenon of the Sun (\\"tel\\") and the creator-deity \\"Tel\\".Okazaki, A. (1984). Living together with \\"bad things\\": The persistence of Gâmk notions of mystical agents. Sudan Sahel studies I, 95-138. Tokyo, Japan: Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa. This confusion may be based on the fact that the Gaahmg language is tonal (that is, relative pitch is used to contrast between different words and/or different grammatical formsStirtz, T. M. (2012). A grammar of Gaahmg, a Nilo- Saharan language of Sudan. Doctoral thesis, Leiden University.). Extensive research on the Gaahmg has been done by anthropologists Charles Jȩdrej and Akira Okazaki, the latter referring to them as \\"Gâmk\\". Writing in 1941, the journalist George Steer, then an officer in the colonial British military force attempting to oust the Italians from Ethiopia, described the Ingessana in his account of the campaign:  Politics  Since the 1980s, the state has become a major battleground for the ideological competition between two opposed models: Khartoum’s attempts at unifying and centralising the country with a dominant Arab-Islamic identity, which South Sudan’s separation is paradoxically reviving, versus the rebel SPLM/A’s and now SRF’s agenda for a more inclusive and devolved Sudan. Attempts to resolve Blue Nile’s past and current conflicts thus very much reflect Sudan’s existential dilemma as to how best it should define itself. By the 1980s, land grabbing and exploitation by the centre led some in Blue Nile to identify more with the South. In 1985, the newly formed SPLM/A was quick to send Southern troops to Blue Nile and recruit from among local communities, including many Ingessana. Some of the most prominent leaders of SPLA/North are Ingessana. As a result of on-going conflict, most of the Ingessana have since 2011 been displaced as refugees to South Sudan.

It was founded between 1339 and 1343 during the Avignon Papacy of the Western Schism, a time of great turmoil for the Catholic Church. The Friends of God were originally centered in Basel, Switzerland and were also fairly important in Strasbourg and Cologne. Some late-nineteenth century writers made large claims for the movement, seeing it both as influential in fourteenth-century mysticism and as a precursor of the Protestant Reformation. Modern studies of the movement, however, have emphasised the derivative and often second-rate character of its mystical literature, and its limited impact on medieval literature in Germany.McGinn, Bernard. The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p408. Name The name \\"Friends of God\\" may have been influenced by various sources. A number of biblical passages use the term (e.g. Judges 8.22, James 2.23, Exodus 33.11, Psalm 138.17, Wisdom 7.27, Lk 12.4, John 15.15) The concept of friendship with God had also been applied by various medieval authors, and particularly among Meister Eckhart and his followers. History The movement grew out of the preaching and teaching of Meister Eckhart, and especially his Dominican spiritual heirs the preacher John Tauler and the writer Henry Suso. An influence on the Friends of God, although remaining in the background, was the secular priest Henry of Nördlingen,Dictionary of German Biography Volume 8, Walther Killy et al., eds; K G Saur Verlag Gmbh & Co; Reprint 2011 ed. Edition p. 493 from the Bavarian Oberland, who met Tauler and Suso in Basel in 1339. Henry had a great deal of interaction with other Bavarian and German mystics Catholic Encyclopedia and introduced the Friends of God to The Flowing Light of the Deity by Mechthild of Magdeburg. The group achieved a nascent institutional form in 1367 when wealthy layman Rulman Merswin purchased and restored a derelict monastery in Strasbourg known as the grünenwörth ('Green Isle'). Grünenwörth served as a refuge for study for the Friends of God and as a “school of prophets” which produced a number of mystical texts.Jones, Rufus M., Studies in Mystical Religion, Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, no date pp. 247-252 (originally published London: Macmillan, 1909) Merswin is suspected of being the anonymous author The Friend of God from the Oberland.Weeks, Andrew. German Mysticism From Hildegard of Bingen to Ludwig Wittgenstein, SUNY Press, 1993, p. 94, The Friends of God, as led by Tauler and Suso, sought a mystical path in line with established Catholic doctrine, following Thomas Aquinas. Rulman Merswin, under the guidance of The Friend of God from the Oberland, wanted to purify the Church. This stress on reform brought The Friends of God into conflict with the Church and not long after Merswin’s death in 1382, they were condemned.Walsh, Reginald. \\"Friends of God.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 December 2017 After Merswin's death, some sources claim that Nicholas of Basel became the leader. He was eventually burned at the stake with two of his followers for heresy at Vienna around 1395.\\"Nicholas of Basel\\", BrillOnLine The relationship of Nicholas of Basel to the Friends of God is unclear as he was condemned as a Beghard.Leff, Gordon.

Texts A number of mystical texts are associated with The Friends of God, most notably the Theologia Germanica and the Book of the Nine Rocks. Many of the works were attributed to The Friend of God from the Oberland, although probably written by Rulman Merswin himself.

It was a free-flowing creek until 1815, when it was channeled to become part of the Washington City Canal. Today, it is located underground in tunnels around the city, including under Constitution Avenue NW. History Originally called Goose Creek, it was renamed by settler Francis Pope. Pope owned a farmstead along the banks of the creek which, in a play on his surname, he named \\"Rome\\" after the Italian city, and he renamed the creek in honor of the river which flows through that city.The Mysterious Mr. Jenkins of Jenkins Hill: The Early History of the Capitol Site - John Michael Vlach (Spring 2004) Using the original Tiber Creek for commercial purposes was part of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's 1791 \\"Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the United States . . .\\".\\"Original Plan of Washington, D.C.\\" U.S. Library of Congress. Accessed 2009-09-16. The idea was that the creek could be widened and channeled into a canal to the Potomac. By 1815 the western portion of the creek became part of the Washington City Canal, running along what is now Constitution Avenue.Cornelius W. Heine (1953). \\"The Washington City Canal.\\" Records of the Columbia Historical Society of Washington, D.C. 53-56 (1953-56) 1-27. Now called Historical Society of Washington, DC. By the 1840s, however, because Washington had no separate storm drain and sewer system, the Washington City Canal had become a notorious open sewer. When Alexander \\"Boss\\" Shepherd joined the DC Board of Public Works in 1871, he and the Board engaged in a massive, albeit uneven, series of infrastructure improvements, including grading and paving streets, planting trees, installing sewers and laying out parks. One of these projects was to enclose Tiber Creek/Washington City Canal. A German immigrant engineer named Adolf Cluss, also on the Board, is credited with constructing a tunnel from Capitol Hill to the Potomac \\"wide enough for a bus to drive through to put Tiber Creek underground.\\"German-American Heritage Society of Washington, D.C.

Many of the buildings on the north side of Constitution Avenue apparently are built on top of the creek, including the Internal Revenue Service Building, part of which is built on wooden piers sunk into the wet ground along the creek course. The low-lying topography there contributed to the flooding of the National Archives Building (Archives I in Washington, DC), IRS, and William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building that forced their temporary closure beginning in late June 2006. In fact, until the mid-1990s, that part of Washington around the intersection of 14th Street and Constitution Avenue was an open parking lot because the underground water was too difficult to deal with. During construction of the Ronald Reagan Building (1990–98), the engineers figured out how to divert the water. But that dewatering then reduced the water level underneath the IRS building which caused the wooden piers to lose stability and part of the IRS building foundation to sink. A pub near Tiber Creek's historic course north of Capitol Hill was named after it.

Life  Rediess was born in Heinsberg, Prussia, German Empire, the son of a court employee. After school, Rediess became an electrician. In June 1918, he enlisted in the German army, serving as an infantryman until the end of the First World War in November 1918. He then worked as an electrician until losing his job in the German economic crisis of 1929. In May 1925, Rediess joined the SA and in December 1925 was approved for membership in the Nazi Party. He led a Düsseldorf SA company in 1927 and was transferred to the SS with his unit in 1930. Promotion swiftly followed for Rediess, achieving the rank of Gruppenführer (Major General) in 1935. At one point, he served as the division commander of SS-Oberabschnitt Südost.  World War II  At the onset of World War II, Rediess was responsible for implementing German racial laws in Prussia, overseeing the deportation of Jews from East Prussia. Rediess was then given the task of eradicating 1,558 Jewish deportees deemed mentally ill. Rediess borrowed \\"gas vans\\" and personnel from other SS units, offering a bounty of ten Reichsmark for each Jew killed. It took nineteen days to accomplish these killings, whereupon Rediess reneged on the payment. Following the German invasion of Norway, Rediess was transferred there to work with Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. In March 1941, citing reports of large numbers of Norwegian women impregnated by German soldiers, Rediess implemented the German Lebensborn program in Norway. This program encouraged the production of \\"racially pure\\" Aryan children, usually sired by SS troops. Ultimately, 8,000 children were born under the auspices of this program, making Norway second only to Germany in registered Aryan births during World War II. Rediess committed suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound upon the collapse of the Third Reich in Norway on 8 May 1945. His remains were destroyed when Josef Terboven killed himself by detonating fifty kilograms of dynamite in a bunker on the Skaugum compound the same day.

However, on May 7, 2012 Nuon announced that Helianthos has been sold to HyET Solar. Process technology The process uses a temporary substrate on which flexible thin- film solar cells are deposited. The use of the temporary substrate allows relatively high processing temperatures while using (semi-)continuous roll-to- roll (or reel-to-reel) production processes and cost-efficient, abundantly available materials. The active layers of such solar cells comprise a transparent conductive oxide layer (TCO), an active absorbent layer (e.g. thin-film silicon), and a back contact layer (e.g. a reflective metal layer). Process sequence The key steps in the process sequence are: # Deposit the TCO layer on a temporary metal substrate foil using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at about 500 °C (932 °F) . # Deposit the active absorber layer (e.g. thin film silicon layer) using plasma enhanced CVD # Deposit the reflective back contact by means of physical vapor deposition # Pattern for monolithic interconnection # Laminate to a permanent carrier foil # Remove the temporary substrate foil by means of wet etching # Confectioning, contact application and encapsulation Applications Using this process, flexible photovoltaic (PV) laminates are fabricated that can substantially reduce the per-kilowatt hour costs of solar electricity. Further, the resulting photovoltaic laminates are lightweight, rugged and offer certain freedoms of design. PV laminates have the potential to be used for a range of applications, including: * Large area roofing and other large area applications to generate electricity * Rural electrification * Industrial applications * Portable applications.

Early life Born in Folkestone, Kent, Sinstadt attended the Harvey Grammar School. Broadcasting career Sinstadt began broadcasting on the British Forces Broadcasting Service in October 1949 and BBC Radio in the 1950s and 1960s – where he was deputy head of sport to Angus Mackay. Whilst at BFBS he met a young 2nd Lieutenant doing his national service by the name of Barry Davies who was keen to try his hand at sports broadcasting. Upon their return to the UK Sinstadt helped Davies to get a foothold in BBC Radio. Sinstadt moved into television in the mid-1960s with Anglia Television. From 1969 to 1981 he was the main football commentator/presenter for Granada Television in North West England, replacing Barry Davies who had moved to the BBC. He presented the Friday evening Granada football magazine preview show Kick Off, and then over the weekend commentated on matches, usually involving Liverpool, Manchester City, Everton and Manchester United which from 1975 until he left were broadcast in Kick Off Match, Granada's regional variation of ITV's The Big Match. He also covered numerous other clubs such as Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers and Preston North End. He often commentated nationally on European matches involving north-west clubs, notably Manchester United's victory over Ajax in the 1976–77 UEFA Cup and Liverpool's defeat of Saint Etienne in the same season's European Cup. Sinstadt covered four World Cups for ITV, from 1970 in Mexico to 1982 in Spain, with the main matches he covered including the live 1978 third-place play-off between Brazil and Italy, and the 1982 semi-final between France and West Germany. He was also part of the ITV team at the European Championships in Italy in 1980. Sinstadt was ITV's number three commentator behind Brian Moore and Hugh Johns, covering the UEFA Cup finals in 1974 and 1976 and the 1978 League Cup Final replay between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool in 1978. During his ITV years he commentated on other sports, including all ball games at the 1972 Munich Olympics, snooker, golf and cricket. Sinstadt left Granada after the 1980–81 season, with his place being taken by Martin Tyler. As well as producing opera programmes, from the beginning of 1982 until the end of the 1982–83 season Sinstadt commentated for TVS. The region had First Division clubs Southampton and Brighton and Hove Albion. Subsequently, he commentated on golf for Channel 4. He rejoined the BBC in the mid-1980s, working as a reporter and commentator for Football Focus and Match of the Day. He also covered other sports such as rowing, including commentating on some of the Steve Redgrave/Matthew Pinsent Olympic successes, and covering the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in the early 1990s, succeeding Harry Carpenter but soon replaced by Barry Davies. While at the BBC, he presented episodes of a BBC2 documentary series Football Fussball Voetbal, a history of European football leading up to Euro 96. He appeared in the Jimmy McGovern television docu-drama Hillsborough (1996), about the football tragedy, having been a BBC television reporter at the stadium while the disaster unfolded seven years earlier. In 1987, he was the first to voice the long-running Trans World Sport. Sinstadt is now retired, but well into the 2000s he continued to report from football grounds for BBC Sport's Final Score programme, broadcast on Saturday afternoons on BBC One and the BBC's interactive digital service. On 22 January 2011 he voiced a short obituary for former Bolton Wanderers and England forward Nat Lofthouse at the end of the BBC's Football Focus programme, and on 16 March 2013 he did the same following the death of his former BBC colleague Tony Gubba. Writing As of 2014, Sinstadt writes a weekly column for The Sentinel newspaper in Staffordshire, reflecting on football and other sports. An author of three published novels in the 1960s, he remains an avid reader and posts book reviews on the Goodreads website, and as a Vine Voice on the Amazon website under the name of GS-trentham. Private life Sinstadt lives in Stoke-on- Trent and is still actively involved in football, as a Staffordshire member of the FA Council and as vice-chairman of the North Staffordshire Youth League.

The canal connected the Anacostia River, called the \\"Eastern Branch\\" at that time, to Tiber Creek, the Potomac River, and later the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O;). The canal fell into disuse in the late 19th century and the city government covered over or filled in various sections in 1871. Built in 1837, the canal's Lockkeeper's House remains today -- at what is now the southwest corner of 17th Street, and Constitution Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D.C., near Constitution Gardens -- as the oldest building on the National Mall.

Boston Public Library Facsimile of manuscript of Peter Charles L'Enfant's 1791 plan for the federal capital city (U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1887). Facsimile of the 1791 L'Enfant plan in Repository of the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division, Washington, D.C. Library of Congress L'Enfant Plan as revised by Andrew Ellicott incorporating the Canal In the early years of the United States there was great interest among political leaders in building canals to support and stimulate economic development. Construction of a canal to run across the city of Washington was supported by local leaders, both in business and government. The plan was to connect the Eastern Branch, which was navigable into Maryland, with the Potomac, which was seen as a gateway to the West. President George Washington had founded the Potowmack Company in 1785 to improve navigation on the Potomac. Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, in designing a master plan for the development of the capital city, supported construction of a canal between the Eastern Branch and Tiber Creek.L'Enfant identified himself as \\"Peter Charles L'Enfant\\" during most of his life, while residing in the United States. He wrote this name on his \\"Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ....\\" (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., Jean Jules Jusserand, popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \\"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic. George Washington University, Washington, D.C. ). The United States Code states in : \\"(a) In General.--The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\\" The National Park Service identifies L'Enfant as \\"Major Peter Charles L'Enfant\\" and as \\"Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant\\" on its website. To raise funds for canal construction, lotteries were conducted in 1796, but these efforts were unsuccessful. There was little additional work done until 1802, when Congress granted a charter for the Washington Canal Company. A small amount of construction was started, but obtaining major financing for the canal continued to be difficult. Congress created a new canal company in 1809 and authorized capitalization of $100,000. A groundbreaking ceremony in southeast Washington, attended by President James Madison and other officials, took place on May 2, 1810. Construction was delayed by the War of 1812 and resumed in 1815. =Canal opening and operation= The Canal in front of the Capitol Building in construction (1860) The Canal in front of the Capitol and the US Botanical Gardens The canal formally opened in late 1815. The canal route began at the Eastern Branch, near the Washington Navy Yard and proceeded north and northwest. Another planned branch proceeded north and northeast from the estuary of James Creek, which divided Greenleaf Point from Buzzard Point but was only constructed in 1866 and never connected with the existing canal.United States Geological Survey topographic map with locations of Greenleaf Point and Buzzard Point in website of TopoQuest. Retrieved 2009-11-17; Wetzel, \\"Buzzard Point\\". Past the point at which these two branches were planned to converge, a single canal channel travelled north towards the Capitol, veered northwestward at the base of Jenkins Hill (Capitol Hill), and then turned again to the north to cross the area in which the National Mall is now located. The canal then turned sharply to the west, joining a straightened and channelized Tiber Creek, which had earlier flowed westward. After traveling westward along the route of Tiber Creek, the canal entered the Potomac River at the mouth of the creek, which was south of the White House. As originally built, the Washington City Canal was shallow and only accommodated boats drawing 3 feet of water or less. The canal's design did not adequately handle tidal variations on the Eastern Branch. As a result, the canal sometimes overran its banks at high tide, and/or experienced insufficient water levels at low tide. Traffic through the canal continued but financial problems persisted, and in 1831 the city purchased the canal corporation. The city effected some repairs during the 1830s and Congress appropriated some additional funds in 1833. Also in 1833, an extension of the C&O; Canal was completed. That extension, designated as the Washington Branch of the C&O; Canal, enabled the C&O; Canal to connect at a new eastern terminus with the western terminus of the Washington City canal at the mouth of Tiber Creek. A lock was built to connect the two canals, and around 1835, a lock keeper's house was built. The lock keeper's house now stands at the southwest corner of Constitution Avenue NW and 17th Street NW, near the National Mall.Coordinates of lock keeper's house: . In 1849, Congress appropriated some additional funds to clean out and deepen portions of the canal, on the condition that the city provide matching funds. The city made some improvements to the canal, but it experienced problems with contractors and staff, and the planned work was not completed in the 1850s. During this period, with the increasing development of railroads, interest in canals waned among both business and government leaders. =Decline= The Canal in 1863 with the Smithsonian Castle and Armory Square Hospital By the late 1850s, the Washington City Canal had fallen into disuse, as had the Washington branch of the C&O; Canal. During the Civil War years the canal deteriorated further and was serving as both a sewer and storm drain system for the central part of the city. Various proposals were circulated to either rehabilitate the city canal or fill it in. Congress appropriated some funds in 1866, but no work was done at that time. In 1871, Alexander \\"Boss\\" Shepherd, the city's head of Public Works, directed that the Tiber Creek portion of the canal be covered over. This work was accomplished over many years, along with other drainage alterations in the central city. A new street that was constructed over this portion of the canal was initially designated as B Street NW. The street was later renamed to Constitution Avenue NW. The southern portion of the Washington City Canal remained open for years afterwards, but eventually was also paved over. The section between South Capitol and New Jersey was filled in in the late 1870s's and the section east of that in the early 1880s. The section east of South Capitol was filled in gradually between 1928 and 1930. A street constructed south of the Capitol over that section of the canal now connects Independence Avenue, Southwest, and E Street, Southeast. Formerly designated as Canal Street, the northernmost section of the street was later renamed to Washington Avenue in commemoration of the state of Washington.Coordinates of Canal Street: Today, the streams flowing under the city in the sewers is often referred to as Tiber Creek though its common past with the Canal is acknowledged.

Early years Clements Kadalie was born in April 1896 in Nkhata Bay District at Chifira village near the Bandawe mission station in Nyasaland, presently Malawi. He was the second born son of Mr. and Mrs. Musa Kadalie Muwamba. He was the grandson of Chiweyu, a paramount chief of the Tonga of Nyasaland. Educated by Church of Scotland missionaries, Kadalie completed teacher training in 1913 graduating from Livingstonia. After a short stint of primary school teaching, Kadalie joined the stream of Nyasalanders seeking employment in neighboring South Africa in early 1915. In 1918, Kadalie settled in Cape Town. Here he befriended Arthur F. Batty, an emerging trade unionist and political activist. In early 1919, with Batty's advice, Kadalie founded the Industrial and Commercial Union (ICU), later renamed the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union of Africa, to protest against unfair labour laws and to protect workers' rights. The ICU spread in the mid-1920s throughout South Africa until 1927, when it could boast a membership of one hundred thousand--the largest trade union ever to have taken root in the continent of Africa. Kadalie headed the ICU from its inception in 1919 until his resignation as national secretary in 1929. In December 1919, Kadalie gained prominence with the success of the dockworkers' strike, which prevented the export of all goods through Cape Town Harbour facilities. The dockworkers' strike lasted fourteen days and involved 2,000 men. The strike laid the foundation for Kadalie's development into a leader known to thousands of people within South Africa. On 24 November 1924, Kadalie was arrested and issued with a deportation order, naming him a prohibited immigrant and ordering him to leave South Africa within three days. In May 1927, Kadalie represented the ICU at the international Labour Conference in Geneva. In 1928, internal fighting within the ICU saw Kadalie being sacked by William G. Ballinger with the full backing of the executive committee of the ICU. In May 1928, Kadalie and six other trade union leaders of the union were arrested under the Native Administration Act. The Act made it a criminal offence to arouse racial animosity towards the white population. Kadalie later formed an independent ICU in East London. On top of that, Kadalie was a provincial organiser of the African National Congress (ANC). He never returned to Malawi and stayed in East London with his wife Eva. With his first wife, Molly Davidson, he had three sons and a daughter. With Eva Moorhead, his second wife, he had one son, Doctor Victor Kadalie. Eva Kadalie also had another son, Robert Joseph Moorhead. Death Kadalie died in 1951. Legacy Kadalie's granddaughter, Rhoda Kadalie, is a prominent academic, columnist and Executive Director of the Impumelelo Social Innovations Centre.

Rankin's parents moved back to Ballywalter, where he grew up, some time after he was born. This was stated when he was the subject of an episode of a short programme named Proud Parents on Channel 4, made in 2006. On the episode of Ready Steady Cook first broadcast on Tuesday 26 February 2008, he himself stated he was born in Scotland. Chef In 1989 Paul Rankin opened Roscoff, the restaurant that was to become the first to win a Michelin Star in Northern Ireland. Soon after opening, it became the favourite meeting place for the Belfast business and arts community, and people travelled from Dublin simply to experience what was considered to be the best cooking in Northern Ireland at the time. Forced by financial difficulties, Rankin sold the restaurant in 2005. The building is now occupied by restaurant CoCo. Many chefs and head chefs, such as Dylan McGrath, Michael Deane and Robbie Millar, have received part of their training there. His first foray into television was in the series Gourmet Ireland, produced by Irish company Waddell Productions, and shown on both BBC and RTE. Both Paul and Jeanne starred in the show that was noted for the banter between the two. Jeanne is a successful pastry chef. He has since been a regular chef on the BBC cookery programme Ready Steady Cook. In 1999 Rankin was the first chef from Northern Ireland to be awarded a Michelin Star. He has written five cookery books & ran The Rankin Group chain of restaurants & cafés, including Cayenne and Roscoff in Belfast. His Canadian wife Jeanne introduced him to cooking and is co-owner of their business. In 2006 Rankin competed in the Northern Ireland heat of the BBC's Great British Menu, a competition to cook for the Queen on her 80th birthday. In 2006, Rankin appeared on The X Factor: Battle of the Stars, along with fellow chefs Jean-Christophe Novelli, Aldo Zilli and Ross Burden. He has also appeared on the TV programme Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is. Rankin has recently sold off most of the Rankin Group to cover business debts, leaving only the flagship Cayenne restaurant under his control, although this too was under negotiation as part of an IVA. This IVA was successful and bankruptcy was avoided. However, the restaurant finally closed its doors on Sunday 24 March 2013 with Rankin citing the economic climate and disruptive protests in the city as being two of the reasons for the closure. The late Robbie Millar made his name while working at Roscoff. Awards * Outstanding Contribution to the Hospitality Industry Award Personal life Paul and Jeanne Rankin were married for more than 25 years. Their marriage ended amicably in 2011. Paul Rankin and Jeanne met in the 1980s, while working in Le Gavroche, a notable restaurant in London. He started there as a dishwasher, while she started as a waitress. Soon they were moved into the kitchen and started their kitchen career. A riding accident left her in constant pain and ended her career as pastry chef. In September 2005 Jeanne publicly acknowledged that she had been heavily dependent upon morphine and other prescription drugs following the accident and had sought help in rehabilitation.Celebrity chef tells of seven-year torment addicted to morphine Daily Telegraph 24 September 2005 In August 2012, Rankin spoke about the devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease. He revealed that his father is suffering from the disease and no longer recognises him.

Some examples of guitar showmanship became trademarks of musicians such as Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Yngwie Malmsteen, Eddie Van Halen, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ace Frehley, and Angus Young. History Blues musicians such as Charley Patton used stunts such as playing the guitar behind their back, and touring R&B; performers further developed these stunts. Jimi Hendrix, who spent his early career touring with R&B; show bands, used some of these gimmicks in his rock sets, such as playing his guitar behind his back, in between his legs, and making it look as if he were playing it with his teeth. Other guitarists such as Joe Satriani and Zakk Wylde employ these techniques and Steve Vai has played with his tongue on several occasions. Buddy Guy has also tossed his guitar up in the air and caught it on exactly the same chord he was previously fretting. Stevie Ray Vaughan also played the guitar behind his head and behind his back. Chuck Berry Chuck Berry's showmanship has been influential on other rock guitar players. He used a one-legged hop routine, and the \\"duckwalk\\", which he first used as a child when he walked \\"stooping with full-bended knees, but with my back and head vertical\\" under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining; he used it when \\"performing in New York for the first time and some journalist branded it the duck walk.\\".Chuck Berry biography at Thomson Gale Pete Townshend The Who's lead guitarist and main songwriter Pete Townshend commonly plays his guitar with a fast windmill motion, inspired by watching Keith Richards' warm- up exercise. At a show in Tacoma, Washington in 1989, he was windmilling so aggressively that he accidentally pierced his hand with the guitar's whammy bar and needed hospital treatment. Townshend also destroys his guitar, usually at the climax of a set. The first occasion was in 1964 at the Railway Tavern in Harrow, which has a low ceiling; he raised his guitar above his head and accidentally drove the headstock into the roof smashing it off. When the audience failed to respond he proceeded to smash the rest of the guitar to pieces. He recalled that, after cracking the headstock: Jimi Hendrix Jimi Hendrix sometimes set fire to his guitar, most notably at the Monterey Pop Festival when, apparently, he felt this was the only way he could upstage the destruction by Pete Townshend and Keith Moon of The Who during their set. On March 31, 1967 at a performance at London Astoria Hendrix sustained hand burns and visited the hospital. Hendrix was also known for having a very erotic stage presence. He would slowly sweep his hand, similar to Townshend's windmill, roll his head, and \\"wipe\\" the guitar's neck to create extra sustain. Hendrix would also make it look as though he were playing guitar with his teeth, such as at the 1967 Monterey International Pop Music Festival during the guitar solo from his popular song \\"Hey Joe\\". Jimmy Page Jimmy Page is famous for playing his guitar with a violin bow, as on the live versions of the songs \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"How Many More Times\\".http://wcbsfm.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/jimmy-page-on-the-violin-bow- whatever-squeaks-i-made-sort-of-intrigued-me/ During Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour, the bow was illuminated and emitted a laser beam from its tip. Page also played part of the solo of the song \\"Heartbreaker\\" holding the guitar over his head while walking across the stage, and then bending a string above the guitar nut to repeatedly change the pitch of the note. He also jumped and opened his legs wide in mid-air when playing \\"Rock And Roll\\". Ritchie Blackmore Ritchie Blackmore often played his guitar in unusual ways during a show—stepping on it with his foot, scraping the strings across the monitors or amplifiers on stage, throwing his guitar and catching it, or swinging it around. An example of Blackmore's onstage antics appears in the California Jam in 1974, where he headlined with Deep Purple. He smashed one of his guitars on a television camera before throwing it into the crowd. In the same show one of his amplifiers blew up and set the stage on fire, but the band finished their set. Yngwie Malmsteen The heavy metal virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen uses a guitar stunt in which he flings the guitar around his body one or more times, held by its strap, for a \\"hula hoop\\" effect, and then brings it back to his hands. This stunt can be seen on the 2003 G3 concert video and in the music video for \\"I'll See the Light, Tonight\\". Other people who have used the \\"hula hoop\\" stunt include Warner E. Hodges as well as Bruce Springsteen during the Super Bowl XLIII Halftime performance. Angus Young Angus Young is famous for his wild onstage antics: intense jumps and running back and forth across the stage while playing his guitar. He scoots across the stage on his back while playing a wild solo. Young would clamber on to Bon Scott's or Brian Johnson's shoulders during concerts and they would make their way through the audience with smoke streaming from a satchel on his own back, while he played an extended guitar solo, usually during the song \\"Rocker\\" with Scott or during \\"Let There Be Rock\\" with Johnson. Young also emulated Chuck Berry's duck-walk while playing in concert.The Guitar Show television documentary, Segment: \\"Upfront with AC/DC's Angus Young\\", 2001 Ace Frehley Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist of the rock band KISS, is known for pyrotechnic guitar gimmicks especially, such as smoke emitting through the neck pickup of the guitar via the use of a trap door, and fireworks that would be shot outward from his guitar neck. Spinal Tap Christopher Guest, portraying lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel of the band Spinal Tap in the film This is Spinal Tap, is shown playing one guitar while playing another with his foot in both a display and parody of guitar showmanship. Parodying Jimmy Page, Tufnel also plays his guitar using a violin, not the bow, but the instrument itself, drawing one stringed instrument across another. When performing live as Tufnel with Spinal Tap, Guest's solos were also known to include playing the guitar with his foot while juggling and playing the guitar from a distance using thrown horseshoes. Stevie Ray Vaughan Stevie Ray Vaughan was known for his aggressive approach to the guitar; he would play his guitar behind his back whilst singing often during his song \\"Texas Flood\\". He also would play behind his head and with his teeth techniques he undoubtedly was influenced to use by his heroes like Jimi Hendrix. Johnny Ramone Johnny Ramone was known for playing in the influential \\"buzzsaw\\" technique, achieved by playing barre chords with rapid downstrokes on all notes in a manner similar to the spinning of a buzzsaw blade. This style later became influential to punk, post-punk, and metal music, with musicians such as Kirk Hammett, Dave Mustaine, and Iron Maiden being influenced by Johnny's guitar-playing. Nils Lofgren Nils Lofgren played guitar while jumping from a trampoline during stage performances, but had to stop following hip replacement surgery in 2008. Rick Nielsen Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick used to play guitar solos on multiple guitars, strapping each of them on top of the previous one. Later, he played a custom-built five-necked guitar instead. Herman Li Herman Li of DragonForce during live performances lifts his guitar with a whammy bar, does hurricane jumps and plays with his tongue. The band itself is well known for its extremely difficult-to-play songs. Sam Totman Sam Totman of DragonForce during live performances, does tornado split jumps from usually tall objects or with a trampoline, and drinks alcohol hands free while playing the guitar.

It signed on in 1939 on 620 kilocycles and broadcast in Wichita Falls until 1994. KWFT was the first radio station to continuously operate in the city and was a regional channel that could be heard across a large geographical area of Texas and Oklahoma during the daytime. The station was a CBS Network affiliate. On December 19, 1947, the Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of KWFT from Mr. and Mrs. Joe P. Carrigan, Laura Lou Carrigan and Mrs. Elizabeth Carrigan Simpson to Edward H. Rowley, H.J. Griffith and Kenyon Brown, operating as KWFT, Incorporated. In 1953, KWFT joined other radio stations in the United States by plunging into the new medium of television. KWFT-TV Channel 6 signed on the air on March 1 and was the first television station in the Wichita Falls. Just as its AM counterpart was a CBS radio affiliate, KWFT-TV was an affiliate of the CBS television network. KWFT sold the TV station in 1956 at which time channel 6 became KSYD-TV and later KAUZ-TV in 1963, continuing as the CBS affiliate for the Wichita Falls-Lawton market. KWFT Radio focused on local and national news, weather, farm reports and middle of the road music. However, as FM radio became more popular for music listening in the 1980s, it cut into KWFT's audience and advertising dollars, leading to the sale of the station in the mid-1990s to a new owner who had other plans for the station. KWFT's last broadcast was at 11:59 p.m. on December 24, 1994. =KAAM and KMKI in Dallas= About two years later, the 620 frequency formerly licensed to Wichita Falls returned to the airwaves licensed to Plano, a suburb in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The new call sign was KAAM. It was owned by Collin County Radio L.C. and it aired an adult standards format.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1997 page B-448 KAAM was sold to The Walt Disney Company for $12 million and switched to the Radio Disney children's radio format in July 1998. KAAM was renamed KMKI (from Disney Character MicKey Mouse). Until Radio Disney's move from Dallas to Burbank, California, KMKI was the network's flagship station. In May 2014, Mediabase moved KMKI, along with other Radio Disney stations, to the Top 40/CHR panel, even though Radio Disney was considered a children's station.Mediabase Announces Panel Changes (Published April 22, 2014, Retrieved August 8, 2014) Final Radio Disney logo for KMKI.

KMKI's affiliation was scheduled to be discontinued on or after September 26, 2014. But the Disney Corp. decided to keep the programming on KMKI until it found a buyer. KMKI has a license to broadcast a digital signal using iBiquity's \\"HD Radio\\" but suspended transmission in the months before the sale announcement.

It means that one should not presume to know the outcome of an event which is still in progress. More specifically, the phrase is used when a situation is (or appears to be) nearing its conclusion. It cautions against assuming that the current state of an event is irreversible and clearly determines how or when the event will end. The phrase is most commonly used in association with organized competitions, particularly sports.  Definition  The phrase is generally understood to be a reference to opera sopranos, who were traditionally overweight. The imagery of Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and its last part, Götterdämmerung, is typically used in depictions accompanying uses of the phrase. The \\"fat lady\\" is thus the valkyrie Brünnhilde, who was traditionally presented as a very buxom lady. Her farewell scene lasts almost twenty minutes and leads directly to the finale of the whole Ring Cycle. As Götterdämmerung is about the end of the world (or at least the world of the Norse gods), in a very significant way \\"it is [all] over when the fat lady sings.\\" The saying has become so well known that it was the subject of an article in the journal Obesity Reviews. Attribution The first recorded use appeared in the Dallas Morning News on March 10, 1976: > Despite his obvious allegiance to the Red Raiders, Texas Tech sports > information director Ralph Carpenter was the picture of professional > objectivity when the Aggies rallied for a 72–72 tie late in the SWC > tournament finals. \\"Hey, Ralph,\\" said Bill Morgan, \\"this... is going to be a > tight one after all.\\" \\"Right\\", said Ralph, \\"the opera ain’t over until the > fat lady sings.\\" In the same newspaper on November 26, 2006, Steve Blow followed up the discovery by contacting Bill Morgan about the incident: > Bill vividly remembers the comment and the uproar it caused throughout the > press box. He always assumed it was coined on the spot. \\"Oh, yeah, it was > vintage Carpenter. He was one of the world’s funniest guys,\\" said Bill, a > contender for that title himself. The 1976 use of the phrase was discovered by Fred R. Shapiro, who published it in The Yale Book of Quotations. It had previously been attributed to sportswriter and broadcaster Dan Cook, who used the phrase after the first basketball game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets (now the Washington Wizards) during the 1978 NBA Playoffs. Cook used the line to illustrate that while the Spurs had won once, the series was not over yet. Shapiro called this a notable example of misattribution. Phrases with similar meanings *\\"It ain't over till it's over\\", a phrase popularized by baseball player Yogi Berra. *\\"Don't count your chickens before they hatch\\", a well-known saying which originated in the 16th century. *\\"The future isn't carved in stone\\", a phrase meaning that the future can always be changed. *\\"Nothing is carved in stone\\" or \\"It isn't carved in stone.\\" a phrase meaning a situation or plans can be changed.

Life Born into an important family in Strasbourg, at the time a free city of the Holy Roman Empire, Rulman Merswin became a banker and amassed a large fortune. Always “a man of watchful conscience and of great fear of God,” he gave up business at age 40, “took leave of the world,” and devoted himself to God as a layman, after the manner of the Franciscan Tertiaries, or the Waldensians. Embarking on his new spiritual life, Merswin was moved to keep his money “to use for God,” a decision which precipitated an experience of ecstasy; he felt himself float off the ground and fly around the garden. Although married to Gertrude of Bietenheim, Merswin resolved to remain celibate. This led to struggles against evil temptation, which he tried to quell through extreme ascetic practices. On the advice of Johannes Tauler, his confessor, Merswin gave up self-mortification. He then fell into severe depression, convinced he was destined for eternal damnation in the fires of Hell; however, he persevered and found, “the joy and peace of the Holy Spirit.” He heard voices and often fell into states of ecstasy. In The Story of the First Four Years of a New Life (which his secretary, Nikolaus von Löwen, claimed was found in a locked cabinet after Merswin's death), Merswin recounts a meeting with a mysterious Friend of God from the Oberland, a confessor, prophet and teacher, to whom Merswin submitted himself completely. Johannes Tauler brought Merswin into the Friends of God, a lay religious society with a mystical focus. In 1367, Merswin purchased an old cloister on an island near Strasbourg to serve as a refuge for study for the Friends of God and as a “school of prophets.” The house, which he called \\"das grüne Wört\\" or Grünenwörth (\\"the green island\\"), produced a number of mystical texts, such as the Book of the Nine Rocks. Many of the works were attributed to The Friend of God from the Oberland, although probably written by Merswin himself.Rufus M. Jones, Studies in Mystical Religion, Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, no date pp. 247-252 (originally published London: Macmillan, 1909) In 1371, Grünenwörth was put under the care of the Knights of St. John. The Friends of God, as led by Tauler and Henry Suso, sought a mystical path in line with established Catholic doctrine, following Thomas Aquinas. Rulman Merswin, under the guidance of The Friend of God from the Oberland, wanted to purify the Church. This stress on reform brought The Friends of God into conflict with the Church and not long after Merswin's death in 1382, they were condemned.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06306a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, The Friends of God See also * Christian Mysticism * Theologia Germanica Notes  External links  * a text containing some biographical information. * The Friends of God * Entry on \\"Friends of God\\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia * Rulman Merswin (in French)'' * http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA007/English/GA007_About.html Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1382 deaths Category:14th-century Christian mystics Category:Roman Catholic mystics ","title":"Rulman Merswin"},{"id":"4853951","title":"Rushaway Stakes"},{"id":"4853952","text":"Herbert Hoover High School is a public high school in Glendale, California, USA.

The school dedicated that issue to Hoover. The school has been the setting for several television programs and movies, most notably Because They're Young, which was filmed at the campus during the summer recess in 1959.http://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Hoover%20High%20School%20-%20651%20Glenwood%20Road,%20Glendale,%20California,%20USA&ref;_=tt_dt_dt The original campus, with the exception of the auditorium and physical education facilities, was demolished in 1966 and replaced with a new facility, which was completed in 1969. In 1990, due to continual and anticipated growth in the number of students entering Hoover High, a 33-classroom facility was built and completed in 1992. In 2001, Hoover High School met its school wide Academic Performance Index (API) and has received over $150,000 in Governor's Incentive Award money. For the past two years, 40% of the graduating seniors planned to attend a four-year college. Some 44.4% of graduating seniors meet the University of California A-G requirements. Hoover High School offers 22 different Advanced Placement (AP) classes which span a wide variety of disciplines including history, English language and literature, science, foreign language, math, economics, art, psychology, and computer programming. In 2010, Hoover High School met its school wide API target with an overall API of 772; an eleven-point gain over 2009. Hoover High's API has grown 158 points in the last 10 years. Fifty students earned recognition from the College Board as \\"AP Scholars\\". Another 15 earned the \\"AP Scholar with Honor\\" designation and 20 students earned the honor of \\"AP Scholar with Distinction.\\" In 2013, Hoover started offering one AP class for 9th graders for human geography, being one of the first high schools to do so. Demographics As of 2010, almost 80% of the students are of Armenian descent, and 15% are Hispanic and Latino. Glendale, California has the largest population of Armenians not in Armenia or Russia.Aghajanian, Liana. \\"Culture Clash: Armenian and Hispanic Relations in the Past, Present and Future \\" (Archive).

Student discipline and culture In 2010 Kevin Welsh, the outgoing principal, stated that there were frequent racial tensions between Armenian and Hispanic/Latino students. In 2000 Jefferey Gettleman and Lee Condon of the Los Angeles Times reported that in the event of disputes between Armenians and Latinos, people take racial lines, and that the groups do not often socially mingle. According to Gettleman and Condon, recent graduates and current students of the school characterized it as \\"polarized\\" between Latinos and Armenians.\\"Glendale Shaken by Slaying of Student.\\" Los Angeles Times. May 7, 2000. Retrieved on January 18, 2016. Tensions between Armenians and Latinos had occurred in other parts of the Los Angeles area. Two violent incidents involving Hoover students were a 1998 shooting of Avetis “Avo” Demirchyan, involving in a dispute between Armenians; and the 2000 stabbing of 12th grade student Raul Aguirre, who attempted to intervene between Armenian and Hispanic gangs but who was not a gang member himself. Both incidents did not occur on campus, but Welsh stated that they damaged the school's reputation. The Aguirre incident was the first death related to Latino-Armenian tensions. On October 3, 2018, a brawl broke out in the school's upper quad during lunch break. Athletics Hoover High School provides a wide variety of sports to students including boys' water polo (3rd place, 2008-2009 season and again 2009-2010 season and reached CIF division VI quarterfinals) and girls' water polo, boys' and girls' volleyball, boys' and girls' soccer (2006-2007 league champions), boys' and girls' basketball, boys' American football (girls are also welcome), baseball, softball, track, cross country, golf, pep squad, swimming and wrestling. The 1975 baseball team won the CIF 4A Championship defeating Lakewood High 2-1 at Dodger Stadium. A significant aspect of the school's history is the long running cross-town rivalry with Glendale High School. \\"BGD\\" known as \\"Big Game Day\\" or \\"Beat Glendale Day\\" is the biggest social/athletic event of the school year. Even though every sport has its own \\"BGD\\" game, American football is the biggest of them all. On the day of the big football game, the school provides events such as \\"The Poster Drop\\", which is a competition for every grade (9-12) taking place on the Friday morning of the game, and spirit assemblies. The game usually takes place at Glendale High School because Hoover High School does not have a \\"proper\\" field. The school's mascot, \\"The Tornadoes\\", was temporarily changed in the past to the \\"Wind Gusts\\" when a Kansas team whose town had just been ravaged by tornadoes came to visit.

Norman Boats were started in 1959 by Ernie Wheeldon. The business started in Shaw Lancs, then moved to Isherwood Street in Heywood Lancs, then back to a new site in Shaw. Other factories were added in Royton and Heywood, and the business expanded into manufacturing windows and windscreens for both Norman Boats and other customers under the name of North West Windows Ltd at the Heywood factory. They also made boat canopies and upholstery under the name of North West Marine Trimmers Ltd at the Padiham & Lancashire factory, where they also made boat trailers (Speedmaster Trailers). At the height of the business in 1971-1973 the business employed approximately 200 people, approximately 120 in boatbuilding and approximately 70 glass fibre laminators, of which approximately 30 were female. Norman Cruisers were in the top three largest pleasure boat builders in the UK, Westerley Yachts being the biggest. In the 1970s approximately 65% of boats were exported. Principal markets (in order of volume) were the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, France and Sweden. Boats in the Netherlands were imported by Internaut of Rotterdam and were sold under the name of \\"Inter\\", hence the 20 was the Inter620. The business ceased trading in December 1979, the Winter of Discontent, and restarted in 1980.

Some moulds were re-built and when the business finally ceased, these were sold and marketed under other names, such as the Atlanta 24. Also some designs were copied and made into hybrids. Mr. Wheeldon once estimated that approximately 7,000 Normans were built. Norman Cruisers went bankrupt in the 1980s.

Abercrombie (August 13, 1930 - April 3, 2006) was a senior staff writer and photographer for National Geographic, well known for his work on Middle Eastern countries. During his tenure at the Geographic magazine, Abercrombie travelled to all seven continents, becoming the first staff photojournalist to travel to the South Pole in 1956 while providing photographs for Paul Siple's coverage of the first overwinter stay at the South Pole Station. Other notable coverage includes his photographs of Jacques Cousteau and his crew aboard Cousteau's vessel the Calypso and the transit of the first white tiger from India to the United States. Abercrombie was the first Western journalist to cover the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in his article Beyond the Sands of Mecca, published 1966. Early life Born in Stillwater, Minnesota, Abercrombie started his career at the Fargo Forum and the Milwaukee Journal. He is an alumnus of Macalester College. His innovative and stunning photographs quickly drew attention and acclaim. By designing an underwater housing (commercially unavailable at the time), Abercrombie pushed the frontiers of photography when he photographed a shipwreck at the bottom of Lake Michigan. Surreal portraits of wife, Lynn Abercrombie, distorted by reflections in stainless steel cook and house ware were published in Life Magazine. His photograph of a robin straining to extract an earthworm from a dramatically low angle caught the eye of Melville Bell Grosvenor at the National Geographic.

He traveled to Japan, Indonesia, Iran and the Asiatic republics of what was then the Soviet Union. He visited nearly every country of the Middle East and became so enamored of the region's people and culture that he converted to Islam in 1964, taking the name Omar. He was the magazine's expert on the Middle East, and reported from Mecca. He covered the region from Morocco to Afghanistan for more than three decades, until he retired in 1994. During his forty years at National Geographic, he published forty stories from all around the world.

He was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 10th round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. Career =1979-1984= He spent his first two professional seasons with the low-A Walla Walla Padres, in the Northwest League. In 64 games, he hit .197/.314/.260/.574, but he put up a .972 fielding percentage. 1979 would see Tingley split his season between the single-A Santa Clara Padres in the California League (52 games, .203/.288/.245/.533) and the double-A level Amarillo Gold Sox (30 games, .256/.356/.356/.711). He joined the Reno Silver Sox for the 1980 campaign, playing in 65 contests for the single-A level California League team, hitting .299/.393/.387/.781. Tingley rejoined the Gold Sox for the 1981 season, playing in 116 games and spending the whole year at the double-A level, hitting .288/.376/.467/.843 with 13 home runs and 60 RBI. He finally reached the triple-A level in 1982, playing in 115 games for the Pacific Coast League Hawaii Islanders (.262/.363/.392/.755). He also made his first major league appearances, playing the final week of the season as San Diego's starting catcher. He batted eighth and collected two hits in 20 at bats. He wouldn't resurface at baseball's top level again for the next six seasons. Tingley played the 1983 season with the Las Vegas Stars, which was the Padres’ new PCL affiliate. He hit .282/.365/.476/.841 in 92 games. Just prior to the 1984 season, San Diego traded him to the Seattle Mariners for Bill Wrona. He spent the season with the Salt Lake City Gulls, mostly on the injured reserve list. He went one-for-two over three appearances. =1985-1991= 1985 would see Tingley spend a season with the Calgary Cannons, Seattle's new PCL affiliate team. He put up a .253/.330/.433/.763 statline with 11 home runs and 47 RBI in 83 contests. He signed on with the Atlanta Braves as a free agent following the season, and appeared in nine games for their Richmond affiliate through the first half of the season before getting released then picked up by the Cleveland Indians. He played 49 games with the Maine Guides in the International League. Between the two clubs, he hit .201/.251/.276/.527with just 13 RBI. Despite this poor showing, Tingley earned a return engagement with Cleveland in 1987, this time with their American Association affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. He played in 57 games through the season and improved his batting line to .269/.376/.467/.843 with five round-trippers and 30 RBI. 1988 would see him join yet another triple-A club for the Indians, the Pacific Coast League Colorado Springs Sky Sox, where he hit .285/.347/.408/.755 in 44 games. That season would also mark his long- awaited return to baseball's top level. He appeared in nine games for Cleveland in August and September. On August 3, in his first game, he hit a two-run home run in his second inning plate appearance. He added a single in the fourth, but the Indians lost to the Baltimore Orioles, 8-3. He started behind the plate seven times and appeared twice as a pinch hitter, but only got two more hits (both singles) to close the season four-for-24. In 1989, Tingley played the majority of the season back with the Sky Sox, appearing in 66 games and hitting .261/.318/.406/.723 with six home runs and 39 RBI. On September 6, the Tribe traded him to the California Angels for Mark McLemore. He didn't spend any time in the minors that season, appearing in four contests for the Angels and going one-for-three from the plate with a walk. 1990 would see him again spend most of the year in the PCL, this time with the Edmonton Trappers, hitting .267/.350/.430/.780 in 54 games. In yet another cup-of- coffee in the majors, he would go hitless in three at bats, drawing a walk over his five appearances. 1991 would mark the season that Tingley finally lost his “rookie” designation, at the age of 32. He played in only 17 games for the Trappers, going .291/.391/.545/.936 with three home runs and 15 RBI. He got called up to the Angels in May of that season, and appeared in a total of 45 games for the club. On May 25, in a 5-0 Angels win over the Toronto Blue Jays, he hit a one out RBI single in the second, later also scoring the second run of the game. He later drew a walk in the fourth and hit a two-out, bases- loaded two-RBI single in the eighth. On June 11, he walked in the second, hit a two-run double in the fourth, later scoring, and walked and scored in the sixth as the Angels defeated the Milwaukee Brewers, 4-3. He finished his season with a .200/.258/.287/.545 statline. Much more impressively, he led the American League by throwing out 52.4% of would-be base stealers. \\"I've played all over in 15 years, from Canada to South America, and it has been an up-and- down journey,\\" Tingley told The L.A. Times. \\"Hopefully I can turn things around and stay on an upswing for the next five years.\\" =1992-1994= In 1992, Tingley stayed in the majors the whole season, appearing in a career- high 71 games and hitting .197/.282/.299/.581. He also ranked fourth in the AL with a 45.1% success rate in gunning down runners trying to steal. On June 16, he hit a three-run home run off Jose Guzman in the second inning of a 4-1 win over the Texas Rangers. On July 25, in a 9-0 win over the Detroit Tigers, he hit a two-out, two-run single in the second inning, also later scoring two runs. 1993 would see Tingley appear in 58 games with California, hitting .200/.277/.278/.555. On August 27, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brewers, he hit a two-out, bases clearing double in the fourth inning of a 7-6 loss. The Angels granted him free agency after the season, and he signed with the Florida Marlins not long afterward for $270,000. Tingley appeared in 19 games for the Marlins, starting 17 of them and appearing twice as a pinch hitter. Halfway through his stay, he became knuckleballer Charlie Hough’s preferred catcher, and played every fifth game. On May 18 he hit his only home run for the Marlins in the second inning of a 4-3 win over the New York Mets. On June 4 he hit a single, a double, and a triple in his three plate appearances against his original team the Padres. The Marlins won, 4-3. Florida granted his free agency on June 30, where he got signed by the Chicago White Sox. =1995-1996= Tingley went 0-for-5 with Chicago, spending the rest of his time with the triple-A Nashville Sounds in the American Association (six games, two-for-16). The 1995 season would see him sign up with the Detroit Tigers, where he played in 54 games and got career highs in most of his hitting stats, with a line of .226/.307/.403/.710, four home runs and 18 RBI. In game two of a double header on September 3, he hit a pinch-hit grand slam in the bottom of the ninth to tie their game with the Indians at eight runs apiece. The Tigers battled back to win in the 10th by a 9-8 final count. He didn't again appear at the major league level. 1996 would mark Tingley's last season of competitive ball, with the Lake Elsinore Storm in the Angels A+ affiliate in the California League, hitting .308/.431/.462/.893 in 13 games.

His name comes from the Bernese Oberland. Identity In Story of the First Four Years of a New Life, Rulman Merswin writes: \\"Of all the wonderful works which God had wrought in me I was not allowed to tell a single word to anybody until the time when it should please God to reveal to a man in the Oberland to come to me. When he came to me God gave me the power to tell him everything.\\" The identity and personality of this \\"Friend of God,\\" who looms so largely in the great collection of mystical literature, and is everywhere treated as a half supernatural character, is one of the most difficult problems in the history of mysticism. The accounts of his life say that about 1343 he was forbidden to reveal his identity to anyone save Rulman Merswin. As all the writings bear the marks of a single authorship it has been assumed that \\"the Friend of God\\" is a literary creation of Merswin.Rufus M. Jones, Studies in Mystical Religion, Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, no date (originally published London: Macmillan, 1909) p. 251, referencing A. Jundt and that Merswin (and his school) produced the entire body of work as tendency literature designed to set forth the ideals of the movement to which he had given his life. Thus \\"the great unknown\\" from the Oberland is the ideal character, \\"who illustrates how God does his work for the world and for the Church through a divinely trained and spiritually illuminated layman,\\" just as William Langland in England about the same time drew the figure of Piers Plowman.Jones, p. 251 Another theory is that Merswin had a dual personality and wrote the works ascribed to The Friend of God from the Oberland while in a dissociative state.Jones, p. 252, referencing A. Jundt A third hypothesis is that the works were compiled by Merswin’s secretary, Nikolaus of Löwen. On Merswin’s death, Nikolaus of Löwen came into a large collection of anonymous mystical works from the library of the Religious House of Grünenwörth, which he and Merswin had founded together, and invented the mysterious Friend of God from the Oberland as the author.Jones, p. 252, referencing Karl Rieder Notes References * Further reading *Rufus M.

From 1972 to 1989 the guitars were mainly produced in Korea by Samick, with the short-lived Professional Series being made in Japan. In 2005, the J.B. Player brand replaced the Hondo name. History The Hondo guitar company was originally formed in 1969 when Jerry Freed and Tommy Moore of the International Music Corporation (IMC) of Fort Worth, Texas, formed a joint-venture with Korean manufacturer Samick Company. IMC's intent was to introduce modern manufacturing techniques and American/Japanese quality standards to the Korean guitar manufacturing industry. The Hondo concept was to offer an organized product line and solid entry-level market instruments at a fair market price. Hondo II banjo played by jazz band By 1975, Hondo had distributors in 70 countries worldwide, and had expanded to producing stringed instruments at the time. In 1976, over 22,000 of the Bi-Centennial banjos were sold. The company also made improvements to the finish quality on their products, introduced scalloped bracing on acoustics, and began using a higher quality brand of tuning machines. Hondo was one of the first overseas guitar builders to feature American-built DiMarzio pickups on the import instruments beginning in 1978. By this year, a number of Hondo II models featured designs based on classic American favorites. In 1979, over 790,000 Hondo instruments were sold worldwide. In 1980, the Professional Series was introduced, featuring higher- end Japanese-made models, produced by Tokai and Matsumoku (Only the Professional Series models were made in Japan, all other Hondos were made in Korea). These models were sold until 1983, alongside the Korean lineup (which became the Deluxe Series in 1981). At that point, the product line consisted of 485 different models. In 1985, IMC acquired major interest in the Charvel/Jackson Company, and began dedicating more time and interest in the higher end guitar market. The Hondo trademark went into mothballs around 1989. However, Jerry Freed started the Jerry Freed International Company in 1989, and acquired the rights to the Hondo trademark in 1991. Freed began distribution of a new line of Hondo guitars produced in India, China and Taiwan. In 1993, the revamped company was relocated to Stuart, Florida. The Hondo Guitar Company was purchased by the MBT International (now Musicorp) in 1995. The Hondo product line was revamped for improved quality while maintaining student-friendly prices. Hondo celebrated their 25th year of manufacturing electric guitars in 1997. Musicorp also owns and distributes J.B. Player instruments which replaced Hondo in 2005.

The character is the daughter of the Red Skull and an enemy of Captain America. Publication history Sin first appeared in Captain America #290 (Feb 1984), and was created by J.M. DeMatteis and Paul Neary. Fictional character biography Sin (left and middle) being aged into adulthood as Mother Superior (right). Art by Paul Neary. Seeking an heir, the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) fathered a daughter with a washerwoman. After the woman died in childbirth, the Red Skull angrily almost killed the child due to being a girl. But follower Susan Scarbo convinced not to, telling him she would raise the girl herself as her nanny. The Red Skull agreed and left the girl now named \\"Sinthea Schmidt\\" with Scarbo to be raised and indoctrinated with the Red Skull's views as she grew up. Red Skull returned when Sinthea was a child and put her in a machine that had her aged into adulthood and gave her superhuman powers.Captain America #298 Marvel Comics, (October 1984) As Mother Superior, she became the leader of a group called the Sisters of Sin, young orphan girls who were accelerated into adulthood and given psionic powers by the Red Skull after being indoctrinated by Sinthea. The Sisters of Sin would have many run-ins with Captain America (Steve Rogers) before being de-aged when they entered a chamber designed to reverse the Red Skull's aging process and they were restored to children (she would later claim she was deaged to the wrong age - but whether this is true or not is unclear). Later, Mother Night reformed the Sisters of Sin and became their new leader, while the de-aged Sinthea herself took the name Sister Sin. Sometime later, she was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and taken to their reeducation facility, where they reprogrammed her with false memories as the \\"normal\\" American girl Erica Holstein. After the Red Skull was seemingly assassinated by the Winter Soldier under Aleksander Lukin's orders, Crossbones broke into the facility, kidnapped her and tortured her to break the reprogramming. After he succeeded, she simply called herself \\"Sin\\" while she entered into a relationship with Crossbones and the two went on a killing spree. She later reunited with the Red Skull while her father was living inside Lukin's mind.Captain America vol. 5 #21 Marvel Comics (October 2006) As the first part of the Red Skull's master plan, Sin disguised herself as a nurse after the Civil War while Crossbones sniped Captain America at the courthouse, even though it meant obeying her father and abandoning Crossbones to his fate. Sin then revealed to Sharon Carter that Carter was the one who had killed Captain America. Now the leader of a new incarnation of the Serpent Squad, Sin breaks Crossbones out of jail. He is later apprehended again and Sin wounded in an attempt to break into the Capitol Building. Sin is later sent to assassinate the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, but is stopped by Captain America (Bucky Barnes).Captain America vol. 5 #42 Marvel Comics In Captain America: Reborn, Sin attempts to assist Norman Osborn to put her father in Steve Rogers's body; however, she is injured by the explosion of her father's mechanical body and her face is hideously scarred.Captain America: Reborn #6 Marvel Comics She is later visited in prison by Baron Helmut Zemo for information on Bucky.Captain America #606 Marvel Comics Sometime later, Master Man springs her from prison, prompting her to take her place as the new \\"Red Skull\\".Captain America #612 Marvel Comics She delivers a video to the media recorded three months before Barnes' trial, declaring that the reformed hero was not brainwashed, but was an accomplice and fully aware of these actions. She, along with Master Man, is later seen on Ellis Island where she pretends to blow up the Statue of Liberty with Falcon and Black Widow bound and gagged inside, unless Bucky is delivered to her. During the Fear Itself storyline, Sin, with Baron Zemo's help, unearths the Hammer of Skadi and becomes Skadi in order to free the Serpent: God of Fear from his underwater prison. Sin vows to do what her father failed to do in taking over the world.Fear Itself: Book of the Skull Marvel Comics She succeeds in her mission in freeing the Serpent and then prepares an army of Nazis to take over the D.C. Capital.Fear Itself #1 Marvel Comics (April 2011) During their battle in Washington, D.C., Skadi mortally wounds the current Captain America.Fear Itself #3 Marvel Comics (June 2011) In the final battle, Skadi battles Rogers. Thor gives Rogers the hammer Mjolnir to make up for the loss of the shield. Thor manages to kill the Serpent and Odin strips the Worthy of their hammers, causing Sin to lose Skadi's powers. This leaves Sin incapacitated.Fear Itself #7 Marvel Comics (October 2011) Sin later returns as one of the villains working alongside Zemo as part of a plot to forcibly sterilize the human race. She battles Captain America (Sam Wilson) and apparently falls to her death after refusing to allow the hero to save her from an explosion.All-New Captain America #1-3 After meeting the mysterious Kobik who was created from a shard of the Cosmic Cube, Sin's face was restored to normal.Captain America: Steve Rogers #2 At the end of the Avengers: Standoff! storyline, Sin was with Red Skull's clone when he re-establishes HYDRA with Crossbones.Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega #1 When Jane Foster is forced to step down from her role on the Congress of the Nine Realms by Cul Borrson, the twisted god attempts to nominate Sin as Midgard's new representative, but Jane has already appointed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Roz Solomon as her replacement. During the Secret Empire storyline, Sin and Crossbones are shown to be in charge of a super- prison that was established by HYDRA. Their super-prison was raided by the Underground in their mission to free their captive friends.Secret Empire #8 Learning of an alternate future where her father took over the world, Sin allies with Miss Sinister and Mysterio, along with the forces of 'Neo-Hydra', with the goal of repeating the feat that led to that victory, in the form of Mysterio manipulating someone- Old Man Logan in the original version of events- into attacking other heroes. However, when Mysterio learns that the other villains plan to kill him once their efforts have succeeded, he turns on the other villains and betrays their location to a group of Avengers, which forces Neo-Hydra to flee.Dead Man Logan #1-#5 Powers and abilities Sin appears to have no superhuman abilities but being trained by her father, the Red Skull, through which she is an expert hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. She is also highly proficient in firearms and explosives, and has a high-level intellect. As Mother Superior, Sin possessed a range of superhuman powers including telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation and intangibility. After she was de-aged, she apparently lost these powers completely - unlike the other \\"Sisters of Sin\\", whose powers were diminished but not eliminated upon de-aging. The reason for this discrepancy has never been revealed. As wielder of the Hammer of Skadi, Sin as \\"Skadi\\" could fly or propel herself through water at great speeds. She could also release large amounts of electricity and energy from the hammer and teleport herself to other places. The hammer could also be used as a blunt-force melee weapon or as a throwing projectile. She eventually lost these powers after the Hammer was apprehended.
