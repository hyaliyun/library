The church grounds include a parish house, cemetery, and pavilion, as well as the church itself. The church is substantially the same as when it was built. Highlights include an altar painting by Sarah Kirkeberg Raugland, and an unusual pressed metal interior in the parish house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. History By the 1870s, the town of Alpena had a sizable Norwegian community, many members of which had recently emigrated from Lier, Norway. With money from their lumbering jobs, members of the community purchased nearby land and founded the community of Leer, with the first permanent settlers arriving in the town in 1879. In 1882, a Norwegian Lutheran Church Society was organized in Leer at the home of Andreas and Gunhild Christopherson. The Reverend Peder lsberg, pastor of the Norwegian Lutheran congregation in Alpena, agreed to travel to Leer four times yearly for services. The Leer congregation met in a local school, and started a building fund with the intention of constructing a church. In 1883, the congregation purchased a plot of land for $1.00 from Karl Burud, on the condition that it be used for a church and cemetery. The first burial in the cemetery occurred in 1885. By 1898, the fund drive was nearing completion, and a building committee was appointed to determine construction details. The final design was based on a German Lutheran church (no longer extant) located in nearby Krakow Township in Presque Isle County. The cornerstone of the church was laid on September 7, 1899, and the remainder of the church was constructed by carpenter Joseph F. Bammel for $3,000. It was completed in 1900. In 1916, a parish house was constructed for $800. The parish house served as the social and educational center of the congregation. The church was modernized in the 1930s and 1940s, with the addition of electrification, a water system, and updated heating. Stained glass windows were installed in 1941-42. A single-story addition to the parish house was constructed in 1963. As of 2014, the church is still being used for services. Description The Norwegian Lutheran Church is a rectangular wood frame vernacular Gothic Revival church, measuring by , with a gable roof and a fieldstone and concrete foundation. It has a centrally positioned, rectangular bell tower high that projects from the front facade. The church entrance is in the base of the tower and is reached via a set of concrete steps. Above the entrance is a single stained glass window. Similar windows line the longer sides of the church. The church was originally constructed of local materials, but is presently clad in white vinyl siding. Inside the church entrance is a small vestibule, along with a cry room and restroom (converted from a former coat room), beyond which is the entrance to the nave. The nave has two rows of eight oak pews with a center aisle. In the front are the chancel, altar, and pulpit, which are flanked by the pastor's dressing room, and another vestibule leading to a rear exit. A balcony is in the rear of the church. The original wood floor is covered with carpeting. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the interior is the altar painting, Crucifixion, by Sarah Kirkeberg Raugland, which is attached to the rear wall of the chancel. A two-story parish house is situated adjacent to the church. It is a wood frame structure with a gambrel roof and concrete block foundation, approximately by . It is clad with vinyl siding, and has a main entrance reached by ten concrete steps. A later single- story addition projects to one side. The upper floor of the historic section of the parish house is a single open space, and is in substantially original condition. The walls and ceiling are covered with elaborate embossed and painted pressed metal panels. The metal panels form wainscoting and an upper rail, and transition to different patterns above the rail. An oak staircase connects the upper floor to the lower. The lower floor, which has been significantly modernized, houses a kitchen, dining and social space, bathroom, and a small office. The cemetery fronts the church property, and contains upright, flat, and obelisk headstones, crafted from granite and marble. Various cedars, yews, pines, and shrubs area scattered throughout the property. A modern pavilion is also located near the church. This structure is an open air gabled structure, with the roof supported by wooden posts sitting on a concrete pad, and an enclosed kitchen and utility facility on one end. The pavilion is modern, built to take the place of the original horse stalls.

Photography Hines first studied photography while in the Royal Canadian Air Force, where he received a diploma in photography, followed by four years of study at the Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, California. In addition to taking and publishing photographs, Hines has lectured extensively on photography throughout Canada and the United States, including fourteen years at the West Coast School of Photography in California. Other activities Hines has an interest in architecture that has had him purchase and restore historic buildings in Nova Scotia, one of which has been converted into a museum: the Rossignol Cultural Centre in Liverpool, which houses the Sherman Hines Museum of Photography. The Sherman Hines Museum of Photography was housed in the former town hall of Liverpool from 1996 - 2014. Currently, it is housed at the Rossignol Cultural Centre. It has four galleries, one of which houses a permanent exhibit of photographs and artifacts of Hines, Yousuf Karsh, Wallace MacAskill, and William Notman. The other three galleries are used for temporary exhibits. Established in 2002, the Rossignol Cultural Centre, located in Liverpool, is housed in a former high school that was to be demolished. The museum consists of five galleries, which includes an apothecary museum, a wildlife art gallery, folk and fine art, a hunting, fishing and guiding museum, a Mi‚Äôkmaq museum, a trapper‚Äôs cabin, and an outdoor cultural village. The Rossignol Cultural Centre also includes a museum featuring another interest of Hines: outhouses. This museum is the only one of its kind in North America. Hines began photographing outhouses in the 1970s, said to have started when he was photographing the oldest remaining house in Mill Village, Nova Scotia which had an outhouse. Hines has published several books featuring outhouses and issues an annual outhouse calendar. One of Hines's architectural finds was a mission and a fortification built in 1699 by the French in Avondale, Nova Scotia, constructed at the request of Abb√© Jean-Louis Le Loutre. According to Hines's research, it is the oldest building in Canada east of Quebec City. Hines purchased the property, which was once owned by George Brightman, in 1982 for $15,000 and spent 30 years restoring the property. In 2012, Hines listed the property for sale for $2 million. Hines is also an avid big game trophy hunter and he publishes photo books about trophy rooms.Brian Cahn, Sherman Hines at the 43rd Annual Safari Club International (2015), Alamy photo Honours Hines has been granted a Fellowship in the American Society of Photographers and been named Canadian Photographer of the Year.

Her book of 1930,Women Workers and the Industrial Revolution, 1750 ‚Äì 1850 was a pioneering effort in women's history, and highly influential in the next half-century. She concluded that women overall gained more than they lost from the Industrial Revolution, as compared to the dangers and unsanitary and harsh working conditions of the previous era.K. Boyd, Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, Volume 1 (1999), pp.921‚Äì2 Life Pinchbeck studied at University of Nottingham, graduating B.A. in 1920; at London School of Economics, M.A., 1927 and Ph.D., 1930. She taught in the Department of Sociology, Social Studies and Economics at Bedford College, University of London from 1929 to 1961.ibid In her classic work, Women workers and the industrial revolution, 1750‚Äì1850, based on her Ph.D. thesis, Pinchbeck argued that in the long run, the Industrial Revolution increased women's employment opportunities, was beneficial to women's social and economic position and therefore was a liberating factor. This conclusion was in contrast to the earlier view of Alice Clark, who believed that industrial capitalism was responsible for the exclusion of women from paid employment, and thus played a crucial role in modern women's oppression. Pinchbeck's two-volume Children in English Society, co-authored with the help of Margaret Hewitt, a former student, described the conditions of poor and orphaned children, from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries, and discussed how legislative and voluntary responses to them had changed over the period.

It has been used as a model organism and has been found to have a very high pulling strength relative to its size.  Morphology  Ecology = Reproduction = Mites in the suborder Desmonomata are thought to have been reproducing exclusively by parthenogenesis for a very long time. All individuals of Archegozetes longisetosus are female and clutches of two to thirty eggs are laid every few days with the reproductive rate averaging 1.3 eggs per day. There are six developmental stages, a prelarval and a larval stage, three nymphal stages and an adult stage. = Food = Oribatid mites differ from other chelicerate animals such as spiders by the fact that they feed on food particles which they digest internally rather than fluid food digested externally. In a feeding experiment, specimens of Archegozetes longisetosus were offered algae Protococcus sp. scraped from tree bark, two fungi, Stachybotrys sp. and Alternaria sp., and some filter papers made of cellulose-rich wood fibres. They fed preferentially on the algae and also consumed the Alternaria but rejected the Stachybotrys and the filter papers. After about ten days they started to secrete chitinase but did not develop cellulase enzymes to break down cellulose under any of the experimental treatments. = Predators = Small rove beetles of the family Staphylinidae live among the leaf litter and largely feed on mites. Archegozetes longisetosus seems to have a chemical defence against being eaten as it has a pair of large oil glands on its abdomen. It was found that the beetles would eat mites from which the oil glands had been removed but would not eat intact specimens. Use as model organism Researchers have found that the pulling strength of the Archegozetes longisetosus equals about 1,180 times its own weight, five times more than might be expected for an animal of this size. As this study was the first to measure the claw forces of mites, other species could well have stronger pulling forces. Archegozetes longisetosus has been used as a model organism for studies in chelicerate morphology, function, behaviour and evolution because of its short life cycle and the ease with which it can be cultured in the laboratory. All the mites of this species used in laboratories around the world are descended from one female collected from the wild in 1993.

This refrigerator was a DIY refrigerator designed around a (Sun-Frost) DC refrigeration unit run on P.V. panels.Earthship Volume 3 by Michael Reynolds Design details The thermal mass used in Michael Reynolds' design is a combination of a liquid (i.e. water or beer) together with concrete mass. Concrete's temperature can be decreased quickly, while a liquid's (such as beer or water) with its higher thermal mass requires more energy to change temperature, holding the cold for longer. In Michael Reynolds' design, the liquid is added in the form of beer cans, placed in the back of the refrigerator. Besides the use of a large quantity of thermal mass, he also made sure that the inside of the box could be in direct contact with the outside air, so as to allow the unit to be cooled without electricity/compressor-assistance during winter. This is done by having the top of the unit openable by placing a skylight on top. A pipe connects the bottom to the outside as well, so as to allow natural circulation of air. The inflow of outside air from the top could be closed off by closing the skylight as well as by closing the removable insulated damper.

The pseudonym Professor Dumpster is based upon his role as part of 'The Dumpster Project', an educational and minimalist living experiment that transformed a trash dumpster into a fully sustainable home. Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project. Jupe Wilson is currently the CEO and co-founder at Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup built for rapid deployment and crisis and humanitarian response. Kasita Kasita Exterior Wilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita. Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking. Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award. Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house. The Dumpster Project Professor Dumpster Wilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)3 non-profit 'The Dumpster Project', a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a environmentally sustainable home. The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources. The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition, but a Kickstarter crowd- funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal. The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \\"poverty tourism\\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity. On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'. Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators. On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster. Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita. No Baggage Experiment Wilson and Bensen in No BaggageTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' No Baggage, in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website. New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones to screen write the film based on a book from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen. American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film. 99 Nights Couchsurfing Experiment Subsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson, launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces. The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen. Academic Work Wilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.

It was edited by Maksim Rayevsky and Nikolai Rogdaev. Nineteen issues of Burevestnik were published during its five years of existence. The name Burevestnik was inspired by Maxim Gorky's poem \\"The Song of the Stormy Petrel\\" (–ü–µ—Å–Ω—è –æ –ë—É—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–µ).

The publication included lengthy debates on the use of terrorism as well as information on the activities of the anarchist movement in Russia. Burevestnik generally adhered to the political line from the Kropotkinite Khleb i Volia group, although anti-syndicalist viewpoints were also expressed in some of its articles (through the participation of Abram Grossman). Between 1906 and 1907, Grossman used the signature \\"A -\\" in Burevestnik. He vehemently accused the Kropotkinists of conflating syndicalism and anarchism, stating that they had been led astray by the French labour movement. Instead, he called for \\"direct, illegal, revolutionary means of warfare\\" to be applied in Russia.Avrich (2005), pp. 84-85.

Although he was generally liked and respected, he was removed from the Bench in 1714, and resumed his political career. He was the grandfather of the Earl of Bellomont (third creation), and a noted bibliophile.Ball, F. Elrington \\" The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 2 p.60 Early life He was the third son of Richard Coote, 1st Baron Coote of Colooney and his wife Mary St. George, daughter of Sir George St. George. Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont (second creation), the controversial governor of New York and Massachusetts, was his eldest brother; Richard was born in 1636, but Thomas, who outlived him by forty years, must have been much younger than his brother. He was the heir of his uncle, also named Thomas Coote, of Cootehill, County Cavan.Ball p.61 Thomas was \\"bred to the law\\":Lodge, John and Archdall, Mervyn Peerage of Ireland Dublin 1789 Vol. 3 p.215 he entered Middle Temple in 1683, returned to Ireland in 1684 to practice at the Irish Bar, and entered the King's Inns the same year. Judge Like his brother Richard, Thomas was a strong supporter of the Glorious Revolution. After King James II, who had been deposed in the Revolution landed in Ireland in 1689, Thomas was attainted by the Patriot Parliament and his property was forfeited. He moved to England and apparently thought of settling there permanently; but in 1690, following the downfall of King James's cause at the Battle of the Boyne, he returned to Ireland. He became Recorder of Dublin later the same year and entered Parliament as member for Dublin in 1692.Ball p.61 In 1693 he was appointed to the Court of King's Bench. In 1697 he was Commissioner of the Great Seal of Ireland.Ball p.61 =Hurley case= In 1701 he presided over the celebrated case of R v. Hurley.For a detailed account of the trial, see Sir James Comyn Irish at Law Secker and Warburg 1981 p.12 Patrick Hurley, a law student at Gray's Inn, was charged with conspiracy and perjury in that he had fraudulently petitioned the Crown for ¬£1000 as compensation for malicious damage for money supposedly stolen from him by highwaymen.Ball p.18 The case aroused a degree of public interest which is not easy now to explain, since the accused, as far as is known, was neither rich nor socially prominent. The trial was treated as a serious one by the Crown, again for reasons which are not clear. The verdict was guilty, after the jury heard overwhelming evidence that Hurley had stolen the money himself.Comyn Irish at Law pp.12-15 Coote, unusually in a criminal case at the time, sat as a single judge, rather than as one of a bench of two or three judges. The rule then was that no trial could go into a second day, and thus the burden on a single judge must have been very great, since it is clear that the court sat from early in the morning, and the jury did not retire until \\"the day was going out\\".Comyn p.15 According to Ball, the trial records indicate that Coote showed himself an active and conscientious judge, questioning all the witnesses vigorously,Ball pp.18-9 although Comyn states that his summing up was rather brief.Comyn p.15 The sentence- a ¬£100 fine or imprisonment in default of payment - was, for the time, relatively lenient.Comyn p.15 =Controversies= In 1705 he caused some controversy by delivering a charge to a grand jury against seditious books, which was thought by his political opponents to be an attack on the Tory party. In 1711, apparently fearing that he was about to be removed from the bench, he went to London to seek a testimonial to his character and political opinions from Jonathan Swift.Ball p.61 In the event he kept his office for another three years, and was drawn into the bitter feud between the Crown and Dublin Corporation in 1713-4, on which, together with some of his colleagues, he signed a number of reports which were seen as partisan. Questioned years later about these reports in the Commons he defended himself on the ground that \\"all men make mistakes\\".Ball p.61 Later career Mrs Crewe, the celebrated political hostess, was Thomas Coote's great-great-granddaughter On the death of Queen Anne, her Irish judges were removed from office en bloc, on account of their political sympathies,Except for Sir Gilbert Dolben, 1st Baronet for reasons which are unclear and some were threatened with impeachment. For most of them, including Coote, the disgrace was temporary:One, Anthony Upton, committed suicide, although it is unclear if this was related to his political disgrace- see Ball p.87 his loyalty to the new dynasty was not seriously in question, and he was extremely popular: the author John Dunton called him \\"a man who was universally loved\\".Ball p.28 He re-entered the House of Commons as knight of the shire for Monaghan in 1723, lost his seat in 1727 but regained it in 1733. He died at Cootehill in 1741, aged about 86.Ball p.61 Descendants He married firstly Frances Copley, daughter of Colonel Christopher Copley of Wadworth and Mary Jones, daughter of Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh, and had a son, Chidley, who died unmarried before his father. He married secondly his distant cousin Eleanor St George, daughter of Sir Thomas St George, Garter King at Arms, of Woodford, Essex and his first wife Clara Pymlowe, and had a son Thomas who died young and a daughter Mary. He married thirdly Anne Lovett, daughter of Christopher Lovett, an Alderman of Dublin, and widow of William Tighe of Rutland, County Carlow, and had nine children of whom at least five‚ÄîCharles, Francis, Elizabeth, Catherine and Anne‚Äîsurvived infancy. Charles was the father of Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont.Lodge and Archdall pp.215-6 Through his daughter Catherine (c.1690-1731) Thomas was the ancestor of the poet Frances Greville and the noted political hostess Frances Anne Crewe. His daughter Elizabeth married Mervyn Pratt MP of Cabra Castle, High Sheriff of Cavan and had issue. Character Coote was a popular and respected figure, noted for his religious piety, charity and love of books.Ball p.28 As a politician he was deeply interested in encouraging the linen trade, and wrote a treatise on the cultivation of flax and hemp.Lodge and Archdall p.215 References Category:1650s births Category:1741 deaths Category:People from County Cavan Category:Members of the Middle Temple Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Recorders of Dublin Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Dublin constituencies Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Monaghan constituencies Category:Irish MPs 1692‚Äì1693 Category:Irish MPs 1715‚Äì1727 Category:Irish MPs 1727‚Äì1760 ","title":"Thomas Coote (Irish politician)"},{"id":"41620426","text":"Josip Kosmatin (born 1897, date of death unknown) was a Yugoslav cyclist.

It lies east of the City of Brownsville, Texas on the Boca Chica peninsula and forms part of the Brownsville‚ÄìHarlingen‚ÄìRaymondville and the Matamoros‚ÄìBrownsville metropolitan areas. It is situated on Texas State Highway 4, immediately south of the South Bay lagoon, and is located about northwest of the mouth of the Rio Grande. In 2014, the village was chosen as the location for the construction of a control facility for the SpaceX South Texas launch site, while the launch site itself was slated to be built just two miles further east, adjacent to Boca Chica State Park on the Gulf coast. History=Early history= The town was founded as Kennedy Shores in 1967 by John Caputa, a Chicagoan property developer, and was initially aimed at working class Polish migrants. Shortly after building a community of about 30 ranch-style houses, the settlement was devastated by Hurricane Beulah later that year, which destroyed the restaurant and public utility systems. Electricity was restored, but many of the homes did not have potable water even decades later. In 1975, local resident Stanley Piotrowicz was voted in as town mayor, who renamed the village Kopernik Shores after Nicolaus Copernicus, and attempted to have the village recognised as an incorporated community, but this was denied. In 1990 and 2000, the population was 26 people. As of 2008, only six people were permanent residents of the village, and that number was down to four people in two homes by 2017, with an average of approximately 12 seasonal residents. =SpaceX= In 2012, private space exploration company SpaceX named Boca Chica as a possible location for the construction of their future private commercial launch site. In August 2014, SpaceX announced that they had selected the Boca Chica area as the location for their South Texas spaceport, and that their \\"control center\\" would actually be on land in the village property, while the launch complex would be located two miles to the east. Limited construction began that year, but more extensive construction activities did not begin until approximately 2018. By May 2018, the site was expected to be used exclusively for launches of the SpaceX second-generation fully-reusable launch vehicle (which was eventually named SpaceX Starship in late 2018), and the launch complex was no longer planned to become a third launch site for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. The launch complex is close enough to the village that‚Äîas rocket tests with propellant loads began to be done in 2019‚Äîresidents were warned to leave their homes during some tests of completed tank structures: \\"at a minimum, you must exit your home or structure and be outside of any building on your property....to avoid or minimize the risk of injury.\\" Flight testing of the SpaceX Starship with a newly designed Raptor rocket engine began in 2019 and have continued into 2020. With the village only a couple of miles from the test site, in August 2019, Cameron County officials‚Äîfollowing requirements set by the US regulatory authority, the FAA‚Äîbegan to request residents to stand outside their homes during any tests that involve loading of propellant fuel, due to perceived danger from shock-wave induced broken windows in the event of a test anomaly and explosion. In September 2019, SpaceX extended an offer to buy each of the houses in Boca Chica Village for three times the fair market value along with an offer of VIP invitations to future launch events. The amount of the offer (3x) was said to be \\"non-negotiable.\\" Homeowners were initially given two weeks for that particular offer to remain valid. Some Boca Chica property owners were happy with the offer and made plans to accept, including one South Dakota owner who was happy to receive 3x what she paid for the property in 2012. But other owners were not, noting that they had made substantial improvements to their properties and that the base valuation used by the September process used county tax assessment valuations and did not look at the specifics of each house so could not be a full appraised valuation. The Houston Chronicle reported that the county seems to be taking a broader view of what is best for the \\"local economy, educational system and quality of living in a region that is one of the poorest in the state.\\" Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevi√±o Jr. specifically mentioned consideration of the \\"450,000, 500,000 people that make up Cameron County, and the other million that make up the Valley, and also all the residents of Texas ... [even though] it is terrible, personally, for those 10 or 20 remaining residential owners\\" in Boca Chica Village. The New York Times reported in late September that SpaceX extended the original two-week offer period by three weeks, in order to allow property owners to work with the county appraiser in order to potentially get their assessed valuations adjusted upward based on improvements beyond what the previous appraisal understood. Many residents who accepted purchase offers had moved away by March 2020. A small number of house owners in Boca Chica Village did not accept the 2019 offer from SpaceX and remained in the village in October 2020, one year after the initial purchase offers from SpaceX were made to residents. > \\"David Finlay, SpaceX‚Äôs Senior Director of Finance, told Boca Chica Village > residents that this would be SpaceX‚Äôs final and best offer and threatened > the company would need to pursue alternate means to obtain the homes if the > people of Boca Chica Village turned down the money. ...

Today, it is used as a shopping mall. It is situated at the Bremer Marktplatz between three streets: Langenstrasse 2/8, Stintbruecke 1 and Bredenstrasse 13.  History  Portal Sculpture at the portal = 18th century = In the 18th century, the region between Stintbruecke, Wilkenstrasse and south-eastern end of Langenstrasse was covered by a mixed variety of small and medium-sized houses, residential and office buildings, two or three storeys high. The image of Langenstrasse was characterised by old packing and storage houses. The smaller houses with gabled roofs behind the Sch√ºtting were pulled down in 1913 when the chamber of commerce building was enlarged. Other buildings were pulled down at the site where the Disconto-Bank was built. = New building in 1912 = The new group of buildings Langen-/Bredenstra√üe/Stintbr√ºcke was designed and built between 1910 and 1912 in neo-Renaissance style by the Berlin architectural practice Richard Bielenberg und Josef Moser on behalf of the Disconto Company. Until 1929, this was an important commercial bank with its head office in Berlin and subsidiaries in Bremen, Frankfurt am Main, London and Hamburg. The new buildings were situated in immediate vicinity of the Sch√ºtting, a traditional building occupied by the Bremen chamber of commerce. The large building is an example of the development of the city of Bremen in the vicinity of the Markt. It was the endeavour of the senate and its group of experts to protect the historical outline of the region around the Bremer Marktplatz. The architects succeeded in designing a modern office building with a fa√ßade decorated with motives of local importance. The impact is created partly by the elaborate use of Muschelkalk freestone in a historicising style. The three-storey building having magnificent proportions has a double-arched pediment on the market side with an open arcade, arched in Gothic style. On top of the arches, ten sculptures, decoratively patterned, are supported on columns. Originally, the longitudinal building fa√ßade at the Langenstrasse was decorated and structured by two dormers which were, however, not preserved. The lower portion of the Langenstrasse fa√ßade consists of clinker-bricks. The saddleback roof originally had several dormers which were replaced later on by more modern, higher dormers. The portal being the representative main entrance to the Disconto Bank at the Langenstrasse consists of three sections. It is framed by columns bearing allegoric sculptures. = Conversion to office building and shopping mall = A major modification of the building was carried out in 1966. Thereafter, the building was used by the Deutsche Telekom as an office. In summer 1999, the building was acquired by the Bremer Investitions- Gesellschaft (BIG). The complex was successively renewed and supplemented according to the design of the architects Manfred Schomers and Rainer Sch√ºrmann. The upper storeys are in use, since 2001, as offices and service centres. The main office of the organisation for the promotion of trade and industry (staatliche Wirtschaftsf√∂rderung Bremen WFB) is situated here. This organisation, together with the real estate company Justus Grosse which is the owner of the adjacent building, reconverted the spaces on floor and basement level into a shopping mall with food and beverage facilities and a light- flooded inner court.  Heritage listings  Since 1994, the buildings Langenstrasse No. 2 to 18 have been listed as an ensemble as historic monument.

The fall is located on Ashgill Beck and is reasonably easily accessible from the B6277 (which crosses a bridge over the beck just above the falls) or from Garrigill village, downstream of the fall. The beck downstream of the main fall is attractive in its own right and features several small cascades. It is a home to several wildlife species, including a much loved staple of British streams - dippers. There are ruins of former industrial buildings nearby, possibly from lead working, which the area was once famous for. While less popular than nearby High Force, Hardraw Force and Cauldron Snout, Ashgill Force is nonetheless an impressive fall, plunging 55 feet over a rocky shelf. A visit to this fall will likely be more tranquil than one to its aforementioned more famous neighbours, as it attracts less tourists to obscure the view. The fall is comparable to the higher Hardraw Force. Arguably Ashgill Force has a greater volume of water tumbling over it. The shelf behind the fall is also much more easily accessible than at Hardraw. Indeed, access behind Hardraw Force is now officially prohibited. Given the forces present on an overhanging cliff with a waterfall, it is perhaps inadvisable to traverse the rear of any unfamiliar fall. Certainly, anyone who does makes that move at their own risk.

As a powerful defender, she represented Australia in the 1995 and 1999 FIFA Women's World Cups as well as at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Tann married Steve Darby in November 1994 and was known as Anissa Tann-Darby until 2001. Captain of the national team between 1991 and 1994, Tann was the first Australian to win 100 caps. She was inducted to the national Soccer Hall of Fame in December 2007. Tann made her debut for Australia at the 1988 FIFA Women's Invitation Tournament, a prototype World Cup. In the first match she suffered a broken arm but played on to help Australia upset Brazil (represented by EC Radar) 1‚Äì0. Tann played in all four games as Australia made a quarter final exit in losing 7‚Äì0 to hosts China. After Australia's poor showing at the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup in Sweden, Tann and Julie Murray were dropped by coach Tom Sermanni. Both were recalled by new coach Greg Brown in 1997. Tann's national team career ended in December 2002 when she tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone and received a two-year global suspension. When Tann appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), her explanation that the substance had been unknowingly ingested through a supplement bought in the United States was accepted but the ban was upheld due to the strict liability nature of the offence.

New Zealand first issued revenue stamps on 1 January 1867 and their general use continued until the early 1950s. The only Revenue Stamp series still in use today is the Game Bird Habitat stamp which is used for payment of the Gun License for the duck shooting season which begins the first weekend of May. There were various types of fiscal stamps for different taxes. Stamp Duty=Queen Victoria= A New Zealand revenue stamp postally used in Christchurch in 1893. New Zealand's first revenues were imperforate long designs portraying Queen Victoria and inscribed STAMP DUTY NEW ZEALAND. This series was issued on 1 January 1867, however some copies are known used in December 1866. In all, the first set consisted of seventy eight stamps with denominations ranging from 1d to ¬£10. In May 1867, these stamps were reissued perforated 12¬Ω, and this time more values were added up to ¬£50. Various changes in the perforation and watermark were also issued around this time. These were replaced by stamps printed by a new die in 1871, with minor differences in the design. On 15 June 1878, a penny lilac revenue stamp was issued in a design based on that of British revenues. On 14 December 1878, this was replaced by a similar stamp in the same design but in blue. In 1880, a new design, also portraying Queen Victoria, was issued. These remained in use for over fifty years, and therefore many printings exist with different perforations, watermarks and papers. Many different denominations were issued ranging from 4d to ¬£1000. From 1 April 1882 these became valid for postal use, and postally used copies generally command higher prices than fiscally used ones. Around 1884, the 1867 imperforate design was reissued in gold, and it was individually printed with the required value at a particular point in time. Government records indicate that the lowest value ordered was ¬£389, and the highest ¬£190,225. =Arms= ¬£5 blue Arms type In 1931, a new design featuring the coat of arms was issued. Fifty values from 1s3d to ¬£1000 were issued, and like the Queen Victoria design, the lower values were valid for postage. Higher values were technically valid for postage as well, but they did not see postal use simply because the denominations were higher than the postal rates. In 1939, some of these were issued overprinted with their face value in large black numerals, in order to help distinguish these values from others which had a similar colour. Twenty eight of these were issued ranging from 3s6d to ¬£1000. In 1935, the Arms design was issued in gold in a larger format and imperforate for use as high values. The value was printed to order, and government records indicate that 1897 different values were issued, many of them unique. The lowest value known is ¬£2192 and the highest ¬£150,000. The Arms design was reissued in decimal currency in 1967. This time only four values were issued: $4, $6, $8 and $10. These were also valid for postal use and were often used to mail parcels. There are various watermarks and papers for this issue. Other types Apart from Stamp Duty revenues, New Zealand also had other types of revenues. These were never valid for postal use. Various types of duty had their own stamps which were either postage or revenue stamps overprinted, or stamp duty designs with altered inscriptions. These were used for: *Ad Valorem - Estate Duty (1868) *Counterpart (1870-1939) *Denoting (1920-1939) *Duty Paid in Full (1868) *Fine Paid (1867-1947) *Mortgagee's Indemnity Fee (1927-1947) *Not Liable (1875-1931) *Passport Fee (1926-1937) *Penalty Paid (1875) Special designs were also issued to pay for the following: *Law Courts (1876) *Lands and Deeds (1877-1879) *Honey Seals (1938-1967) *Fruit Inspection Fee (1950) In 1878 a series of large Beer Duty stamps portraying Queen Victoria was issued. These were replaced by a rectangular design in 1885, again with the Queen's portrait. This was replaced by a similar issue portraying King Edward VII in 1908. Various stamps inscribed UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF, EMPLOYMENT or SOCIAL SECURITY were issued between 1931 and 1958 to pay for wages tax. Many of these were overprinted with a control overprint with the year of issue. Various airports have issued their own stamps to pay for the airport departure fee since 1971. New Zealand has also issued Game Bird Habitat stamps annually since 1994. Despite not being postage stamps, these are marketed by New Zealand Post and first day covers are also produced.

Biography  Vincent Manago was born in Toulon in France in 1880. He migrated to North Africa and then to France and painted landscape views and street scenes. Vincent Manago was a very popular painter in Marseille between 1900 and 1913, where his work was shown at the Foire internationale de Marseille and at the Exposition Coloniale des Paysages d'Afrique et de Provence. He specialised in landscape, marine and genre paintings of the Mediterranean coast (Port de Martiques, La Rochelle, Venice) and in Orientalist painting. The latter showed the influence of his stay in Tunisia and Algeria on his art. He used vivid colors in his paintings.

This excludes the engine or motor that generates the power. In contrast, the powertrain is considered to include both the engine or motor and the drivetrain.  Function  The function of the drivetrain is to couple the engine that produces the power to the driving wheels that use this mechanical power to rotate the axle. This connection involves physically linking the two components, which may be at opposite ends of the vehicle and so requiring a long propeller shaft or drive shaft. The operating speed of the engine and wheels are also different and must be matched by the correct gear ratio. As the vehicle speed changes, the ideal engine speed must remain approximately constant for efficient operation and so this gearbox ratio must also be changed, either manually, automatically or by an automatic continuous variation.  Components  The precise components of the drivetrain vary, according to the type of vehicle.

Only one aircraft was flown during 1936 before it was destroyed in an accident. Design and development The Varivol was an odd looking biplane with a deep and bulky fuselage with a knife edge rear where the rudder was attached and a braced variable-incidence tailplane was mounted on top of the rear fuselage. The unique feature of the aircraft were the two narrow-chord biplane wings in an inverted sesquiplane configuration. The wings were wire-braced and had one interplane strut on each side. The upper wing normally had an area of but additional flexible surfaces inside the fuselage could be extended using an electrical motor to increase the wing area to . It was also possible to change the camber of the wings when extended. The Varivol was powered by a Salmson radial piston engine with a two-bladed propeller. It was first tested in a wind tunnel at Chalais-Meudon before starting test flying in March 1936. The aircraft continued to fly successfully until November 1936 when it was destroyed in a fatal crash, an investigation determined the accident was not due to the variable-area wings. Further developments Further development of the Varivol concept was carried out with the G√©rin 1938 V.6E Varivol Racer a sleek monoplane racing aircraft that was built just prior to and during World War II, being put into storage after the war.

It is a redundant Anglican parish church, formerly in the diocese of Chester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St John's was built in 1832‚Äì33, and was designed by Henry Turberville Edwards; it is his only known work. The church was built on land owned by Sir John Tobin, whose son became the first vicar. The church was consecrated on 31 October 1831 by the Rt. Revd. John Bird Sumner, bishop of Chester, and it opened for worship on 19 May 1833. In 1881 it was restored by Cornelius Sherlock; this included removing the galleries, replacing box pews with benches, moving the organ, enclosing the chancel, and adding two new windows. In 1942 the church was damaged by bomb blast, and was repaired in the 1950s with a new roof. It was declared redundant on 1 July 2004, and approval for conversion into residential use was agreed on 6 December 2006. As of August 2018 the church was put into private ownership with the intention of reopening it as Church again. Architecture=Exterior= The church is built in stone from Storeton quarry, and is in Neoclassical style. On the entrance front is a Doric portico consisting of four fluted columns without bases, carrying an entablature with a triglyph frieze and a pediment. Flanking the portico are windows with architraves and pediments. There are six similar windows along each side of the church, and running round the church above them is a panelled parapet. At the rear, the narrower chancel projects under a pediment. On its rear wall is a blind window with four pilasters and an entablature with wreathes. =Interior= Inside the church is an elliptical chancel arch. When the building was in use as a church, it had a tripartite painted reredos, and there were paintings round the walls of the nave. The font was in alabaster, it stood on three marble steps, and was supported by carved angels. It was decorated with cherubs' heads and gadrooning. The timber pulpit was part of a former two-decker. The ceiling has a span of , which makes it the largest unsupported ceiling in Merseyside. The original pipe organ was made by Bewsher and Fleetwood and had two manuals. This was enlarged to three manuals in 1902 by Hele and Company. It was further enlarged in 1925 by Henry Willis, repaired following bomb damage in the 1950s by Rushworth and Dreaper, cleaned in the 1970s by Cowin, and restored in 1999 by Harrison and Harrison. After the church was closed, the organ was moved by David Wells to St James' Church, New Brighton.

History Highams Park Lake was formed in the early 19th century by the famous landscape gardener Humphry Repton, who diverted the River Ching which flooded the site to create the lake. The lake was part of the grounds of the Large Manor Of Highams, built in 1768 and converted into a hospital for wounded soldiers during the Crimean war of 1853‚Äì1856, and today the Woodford County High School for Girls. The lake was given to the public in the late 19th century. There has been a boating history for over 100 years on this lake with an \\"old boat house\\". The boathouse today is leased from the Corporation of London by Waltham Forest South District Scouts who have spent a considerable amount of money in developing the boathouse and making it functional again. The lake was featured on the BBC \\"Blue Peter\\" children's programme in the late 1970s, when the whole boat house roof had to be lifted off to extract a large yacht, which had been restored inside it by the club members, on to a large craned lorry to take the vessel to the sea. Money was raised by the youngsters collecting old newspapers from the Chingford and Highams Park community once a week and then selling them by weight. The yacht club owner helped them to build the club boats, which were single sailed yachts (mostly Flies) scaled down to child size, and only charged about 45p a week club fees to boys who could afford it ‚Äì for the rest it was free. Other yachts used on the lake in the 1960s up to the 1980s were the Moth IV (a larger boat than the Flies). The Fly class boats were built at the clubhouse by the club owner Ken Ford. The boys who were members of the Lee Avon Sailing Club came from a wide variety of social classes but all learned valuable woodworking, sailing and community skills. The Fly class boats were also built \\"on stand\\" at the London boat show for some years hoping to gain commercial recognition.  Highams Park  Highams Park is a large area of parkland adjacent to the lake. In the 1940s \\"Prefab\\" houses were built and stood above the lake; they were demolished in 1969. The park borders Woodford Green and reaches close to Chingford Hatch.  Maintenance  Following a panel engineer's report major works were planned for the Highams Park Lake area over the following three years. Highams Park had been upgraded to a Category A Reservoir, meaning that flooding at the site has the potential to cause deaths. The Highams Park Forum was concerned to ensure that any work undertaken would be sensitive to the Repton landscape, which is one of Repton's Red Book designs. The existing dam would need to be raised and it was expected to be a challenge to do this work sympathetically to the Repton landscape.Highams Park Forum  See also  *Highams Park School *Highams Park *Highams Park Station *Hale End  References  *Walthamstow memories *Highams Park Society Category:Geography of the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Lakes of London ","title":"Highams Park Lake (Waltham Forest, London)"},{"id":"41620720","text":"Yvonne Nauta (born 21 February 1991) is a Dutch female speed skater who is specialised in long distances and was born in Uitwellingerga.

May 16, 934?Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.The chronology in the Zizhi Tongjian suggested that Meng Hanqiong was executed on May 16, but did not directly state so. In any case, he would have been executed sometime between May 14 (when he fled Luoyang against Li Conghou's orders) and May 18 (when Li Congke, who executed Meng prior to entering Luoyang, then entered Luoyang).), was a eunuch of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Tang. He became powerful late in the reign of its second emperor Li Siyuan, in association with Li Siyuan's favorite concubine Consort Wang, and continued to be during the reign of Li Siyuan's son and successor Li Conghou. He was killed by Li Conghou's adoptive brother Li Congke, who overthrew Li Conghou.  Background  It is not known when, or where, Meng Hanqiong was born. It is known that in his youth, he served as a eunuch servant of Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 72. It appeared that after Wang Rong was assassinated and succeeded by his adoptive son Zhang Wenli, in 921, and then Zhao territory was eventually conquered and incorporated into Jin by Jin's prince Li Cunxu in 922,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. Meng remained at Zhao's capital Zhending (ÁúüÂÆö, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), for he came to serve under Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Siyuan when Li Cunxu, by that time carrying the title of emperor of a new Later Tang, was commissioned by Li Cunxu as the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered at Zhending) in 925.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273.  During Li Siyuan's reign  Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at the capital Luoyang in 926, and Li Siyuan succeeded him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Meng Hanqiong subsequently served in various capacities in Li Siyuan's palace. In 930, when, at the insistence of Li Siyuan's powerful chief of staff An Chonghui, Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke was removed from his post as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Li Congke was forbidden from seeing the emperor, and An was repeatedly trying to find ways to further accuse Li Congke of crimes. Li Congke, however, was spared through the intercession of Li Siyuan's favorite concubine Consort Wang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. She often communicated with Li Congke by sending Meng to see him; Meng therefore considered himself a benefactor to Li Congke. As of late 930, Meng was serving as director of miscellaneous affairs (Ê≠¶Âæ∑‰Ωø, Wudeshi) inside the palace, and both he and Consort Wang were repeatedly accusing An of faults. An, viewing his position as precarious, thus offered to resign. However, when Li Siyuan subsequently sent Meng to consult the chancellors on their opinion on this matter, the results were mixed ‚Äî Feng Dao believe that it was better for An to resign, while Zhao Feng believed that An should remain chief of staff. As a result, Li Siyuan took no action at that time. Later in 930, with the imperial forces boggled down in a campaign that An advocated ‚Äî against the military governors Meng Zhixiang of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and Dong Zhang of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) ‚Äî An departed Luoyang for the front to oversee the campaign. While he was on the way there, though, Zhu Hongzhao the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi); the commander of the forces against Xichuan and Dongchuan, Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang; as well as Meng Hanqiong (who was carrying the title of the director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi) at that point), all submitted petitions suggesting that An may be intent on seizing the command of the army. Li Siyuan thus recalled An, then made him the military governor of Hezhong, then ordered him into retirement, and then killed him. (It was not until after An was killed that the restrictions on Li Congke were lifted.) In 931, Meng Hanqiong was additionally made the acting director of the eunuch bureau (ÂÖß‰æçÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng). It was said that while Fan Yanguang and Zhao Yanshou served as the chiefs of staff, they feared being accused of power-grabbing, just as An had, so they often declined to rule on important matters. The decisions thus often fell into the hands of Consort Wang and Meng. While An was alive, he had put a strict limit on palace expenditures. Now, with Meng being powerful, he often simply had various items retrieved from the government treasury, claiming orders from Li Siyuan's wife Empress Cao, without notifying the office of the chiefs of staff or the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies), and without keeping records of them. However, the one person at the court who was without anyone to control him was Li Siyuan's oldest surviving son Li Congrong the Prince of Qin, who was generally considered the likely heir but who had no respect for any other official or general, including Fan or Zhao. Fan and Zhao, fearing that given their poor relationships with Li Congrong that they would eventually suffer disaster, both sought to leave the chief of staff post and leave Luoyang to serve as military governors. Li Siyuan, however, resisted, believing that they were abandoning him. In winter 932, after Zhao had already been allowed to leave (to serve as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and was replaced by Zhu, Fan had Consort Wang and Meng speak on his behalf, and was finally allowed to leave Luoyang to serve as the military governor of Chengde. He was replaced by Feng Yun. (Despite Meng's intercession for him, Fan, when leaving Li Siyuan, nevertheless cautioned Li Siyuan against Meng's influence, albeit in veiled terms.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. Not long after, Li Siyuan became deathly ill. Li Congrong became concerned whether the high level officials would divert the succession away from him, and therefore informed Zhu and Feng that he was intending to enter the palace forcibly. When Zhu and Feng sent back messages indicating their opposition, Li Congrong launched his guard corps and approached the palace. Feng, hearing the news, quickly convened a meeting with Zhu, Meng, the imperial guard general Kang Yicheng (), and the director of the financial agencies Sun Yue () to discuss what to do. While Feng advocated resisting Li Congrong, the meeting came to a standstill when Kang was not responding to Feng's arguments. Meng, ignoring Kang, broke up the meeting by stating that he was going to enter the palace to protect the emperor, and then left for the palace; Zhu and Feng followed, and Kang felt compelled to follow as well. Subsequently, under Zhu's and Feng's orders, and with Meng personally summoning the imperial guard general Zhu Hongshi () to command the resistance, the imperial guards resisted and defeated Li Congrong's guards. Li Congrong was killed. Li Siyuan, who had recovered slightly, thereafter resolved to summon another son, Li Conghou the Prince of Song, who was then serving as the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). He sent Meng to Tianxiong to deliver the summons, and also to remain there to temporarily oversee the governance of Tianxiong. Meng did so, but before Li Conghou could arrive at Luoyang, Li Siyuan died. Li Conghou subsequently arrived at Luoyang and succeeded Li Siyuan as emperor.  During Li Conghou's reign  Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun remained Li Conghou's chiefs of staff and became the dominant figures in their administration, and they did not trust Li Congke, who was then serving as the military governor of Fengxiang, or Shi Jingtang, who was then serving as the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), as both Li Congke and Shi had had great accomplishments while serving under Li Siyuan and were respected by the army. In spring 934, because they did not want Shi to remain at Hedong for long, and wanted to recall Meng from Tianxiong, they issued a number of transfer orders as chiefs of staff ‚Äî transferring Li Congke from Fengxiang to Hedong, Shi from Hedong to Chengde, and Fan Yanguang from Chengde to Tianxiong, and recalling Meng from Tianxiong. Li Congke, believing that these orders were targeted against him, rebelled. Initially, the imperial forces sent against Li Congke, commanded by the general Wang Sitong, were victorious, and quickly put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege. However, when his officer Yang Siquan () defected to Li Congke, the imperial army lost its morale and collapsed, largely surrendering to Li Congke. Li Congke took the army and headed for Luoyang. Li Conghou sent Kang against Li Congke, but Kang also surrendered to Li Congke, leaving Luoyang defenseless at that point. Li Conghou wanted to flee to Tianxiong, and ordered Meng to go to Tianxiong to first prepare for his arrival. Meng, however, had already decided not to keep his allegiance to Li Conghou by this point and, upon receiving the order, left Luoyang, but did not head for Tianxiong; instead, he headed toward Li Congke's army, then having reached Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), to submit to Li Congke, believing that his old relationship with Li Congke would lead to his being spared. When he rendezvoused with Li Congke just west of Mianchi (Êæ†Ê±†, in modern Sanmenxia), he cried bitterly and tried to speak in his own defense. Li Congke responded, \\"You need not speak. I already know.\\" Believing that Li Congke had forgiven him, he inserted himself into the procession of the officials following Li Congke's march. Seeing this, Li Congke ordered that he be beheaded by the side of the road.  Notes and references  * History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 72. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 277, 278, 279.

The government uses four levels of personnel security controls depending on the level of assurance required. Three of these levels are types of national security vetting clearance. Vetting is intended to assure government bodies that the individual has not been involved in espionage, terrorism, sabotage or actions intended to overthrow or undermine Parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent means. It also assures the department that the individual has not been a member of, or associated with, an organisation which has advocated such activities or has demonstrated a lack of reliability through dishonesty, lack of integrity or behaviour. Finally, the process assures the department that the individual will not be subject to pressure or improper influence through past behaviour or personal circumstances.Hansard, Written answers 15 Dec 1994 Hansard online Vetting is usually carried out by United Kingdom Security Vetting (UKSV). UKSV was created in January 2017 by combining DBS National Security Vetting (DBS NSV) and FCO Services National Security Vetting (FCOS NSV). This change was an outcome of the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555607/2015_Strategic_Defence_and_Security_Review.pdf Types of personnel security check=Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)= The Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks are normally performed when a person is recruited. All those with access to government assets are subject on recruitment to the requirements of the Baseline Personnel Security Standard. This includes all applicants for employment in the civil service and armed forces and applies to both permanent and temporary staff and private sector employees working on government contracts, with access to government assets. The Baseline Personnel Security Standard requires the verification of the following four elements: # Identity # Employment history (past three years) # Nationality and immigration status # Criminal record (unspent convictions only) A reasonable account of any significant periods (a total of 6 months or more in the past 3 years) spent abroad. Prospective employees who have recently come to the UK or lived abroad may be asked to provide overseas police certificates of good conduct. BPSS * Allows access to UK OFFICIAL assets and occasional access to UK SECRET assets * Is required to work in areas where SECRET and TOP SECRET information may be overheard * Allows individuals who require it, access to the Public Services Network (PSN) Employers may initiate the following incremental national security vetting checks on recruits after performing the BPSS check. =Counter Terrorist Check (CTC)= A Counter Terrorist Check (CTC) is required for individuals who are employed in posts that: * Involve proximity to public figures assessed to be at particular risk from terrorist attack. * Give access to information or material assessed to be of value to terrorists. However, it is not designed to manage access to sensitive information. * Involve unescorted access to certain military, civil, industrial or commercial establishments assessed to be at particular risk from terrorist attack. The process for CTC clearance includes: * BPSS check; * Completion of a security clearance questionnaire by the candidate; * Checks against UK criminal records covering both spent and unspent convictions; * Checks against Security Service (MI5) records; * It may also include an interview. A CTC clearance must be formally reviewed after ten years (five years for non-List X Contractors). In the transport sector security vetting requirements, including for Counter Terrorist Check, is regulated by the Department of Transport. A CTC is required for police officers and many associated staff. =Security Check (SC)= A Security Check (SC) is the most widely held level of security clearance. SC is required for posts involving regular and uncontrolled access to SECRET assets and/or occasional, supervised access to TOP SECRET assets, and for individuals who: * While not in such posts, will be in a position to directly or indirectly bring about the same degree of damage. * Will have sufficient knowledge to obtain a comprehensive picture of a SECRET plan, policy or project. * Are being considered for employment where it would not be possible to make reasonable career progress without security clearance for access to SECRET assets. * Require access to certain levels of classified material originating from another country or international organisation. The process for SC clearance includes: * Successful completion of the Baseline Personnel Security Standard. * Completion, by the individual, of a Security Questionnaire. * A departmental/company records check which will include e.g. personal files, staff reports, sick leave returns and security records. * A check of both spent and unspent criminal records. * A check of credit and financial history with a credit reference agency. * A check of Security Service (MI5) records. * It may also include an interview. Checks may extend to third parties included on the security questionnaire. An SC security clearance must be formally reviewed after ten years (seven years for non-List X contractors) or at any time up to that point at the discretion of the vetting authority. A SC holder is issued a yellow coloured badge.Dominic Cummings Doesn‚Äôt Appear To Have The Level Of Security Clearance That Someone In His Role Usually Has =Enhanced Security Check (eSC)= This is similar to an SC but also includes a financial questionnaire. =Developed Vetting (DV)= DV is the most detailed and comprehensive form of security clearance in UK government. It is needed for posts that require individuals to have frequent and uncontrolled access to TOP SECRET assets, or require any access to TOP SECRET codeword material. It is also required for individuals who: * While not in such posts, will be in a position to directly or indirectly bring about the same degree of damage. * Require frequent and uncontrolled access to Category I nuclear material. * Require access to certain levels of classified material originating from another country or international organisation. The process for DV clearance includes: * BPSS check. * Completion, by the individual, of a Security Questionnaire, a DV Supplement and Financial Questionnaire. * A check of both spent and unspent criminal records. * A check of credit and financial history with a credit reference agency. * A check of Security Service (MI5) records. * A full review of personal finances. * A detailed interview conducted by a vetting officer. * Further enquiries, including interviews with referees conducted by a vetting officer. A DV security clearance must be reviewed every seven years or at any time up to those points at the discretion of the vetting authority. Government officials with DV clearance are issued a green coloured badge.Dominic Cummings Doesn‚Äôt Appear To Have The Level Of Security Clearance That Someone In His Role Usually Has =Enhanced Developed Vetting (eDV)= Enhanced Developed Vetting requires additional in-depth interviews, which may be necessary for certain roles. Other UK clearances In addition to national security clearances, other types of roles and organisations stipulate a need for clearances, including: *Vulnerable group access (including children), as operated by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), replacing former Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) checks. *Law enforcement, with a hierarchy of Police Personnel Vetting (PPV) and Non-Police Personnel Vetting (NPPV) levels, which are broadly aligned with national security clearance levels, but differ in focusing predominantly on susceptibility to criminality. Change of personal circumstances A change of personal circumstances (CPC) questionnaire has to be submitted when an SC, DV or CTC clearance holder is \\"marrying, remarrying, entering into a civil partnership, setting up a stable unmarried relationship which includes living with someone as a couple\\". DV clearance holders also have to report the arrival of new \\"co- residents\\" such as a lodger or flatmate. When two cleared persons marry both have to submit CPC questionnaires. Transfer of a clearance A request can be made to transfer national security clearances between organisations, providing they have not expired. Transfers are requested by the \\"new employing sponsor\\". Transfers can be the same level of clearance or lower. No more than twelve months must have elapsed since the holder left the organisation for which the clearance was originally granted and no more than six months living overseas. New completed change of circumstances questionnaires, to bring the UKSV records up to date, may be required. The new sponsor reviews the details of the clearance and decides if it is acceptable for the specific new role.

He was appointed by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as the Special Envoy for Chinese Affairs. He was the recipient of the 4th Dr. Jose P. Rizal Awards for Excellence Lifetime Achievement Award. He is also the past President of the Federation of the Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII), and a Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Chiang Kai Shek College. Education John Ng finished his secondary education at the Chiang Kai Shek College. Professional profile Ng immigrated from China in 1949 when he was 11 years old. At 26, the year after he got married, he took over the business. He then expanded the business and ventured into steel manufacturing, putting up Pacific Steel and Cathay Metal. He later expanded into property development by establishing Cathay Land, Inc., in 1994. The company has over 500 hectares of landbank in Calabarzon and Metro Manila. His son, Jeffrey Ng, is heading the property businesses. Businesses John Ng own include PC Express, a leading computer retail shop, and Eurotile. He was the Presidential Advisor to former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada on steel industry, and was appointed by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as the special envoy for Chinese affairs because of his strong ties to both Mainland China and Chinese Filipino businessmen. He was the past president of the FCCCII and spearheaded the construction of the hundreds of school buildings in barangays all over the country, and the donation of homes to the less privileged through Gawad Kalinga.

When a geometric separator exists, it can be used for building divide-and-conquer algorithms for solving various problems in computational geometry.  Separators that are closed shapes  A simple case in which a separator is guaranteed to exist is the following: :: Given a set of n disjoint axis- parallel squares in the plane, there is a rectangle R such that, at most 2n/3 of the squares are inside R, at most 2n/3 of the squares are outside R, and at most O(sqrt(n)) of the squares are not inside and not outside R (i.e. intersect the boundary of R). Thus, R is a geometric separator that separates the n squares into two subset (\\"inside R\\" and \\"outside R\\"), with a relatively small \\"loss\\" (the squares intersected by R are considered \\"lost\\" because they do not belong to any of the two subsets). = Proof = Define a 2-fat rectangle as an axis-parallel rectangle with an aspect ratio of at most 2\\\\. Let R0 be a minimal-area 2-fat rectangle that contains the centers of at least n/3 squares. Thus every 2-fat rectangle smaller than R0 contains fewer than n/3 squares. For every t in [0,1), let Rt be a 2-fat rectangle with the same center as R0, inflated by 1 + t. * Rt contains R0, so it contains the centers of at least n/3 squares. * Rt is less than twice as large as R0, so it can be covered by two 2-fat rectangles that are smaller than R0. Each of these 2-fat rectangles contains the centers of less than n/3 squares. Therefore Rt contains the centers of less than 2n/3 squares. Now it remains to show that there is a t for which Rt intersects at most O(sqrt(n)) squares. First, consider all the \\"large squares\\" ‚Äì the squares whose side-length is at least \\\\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \\\\sqrt{n}. For every t, the perimeter of Rt is at most 2*perimeter(R0) which is at most 6*width(R0), so it can intersect at most 12 \\\\sqrt{n} large squares. Next, consider all the \\"small squares\\" ‚Äì the squares whose side-length is less than \\\\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \\\\sqrt{n}. For every t, define: intersect(t) as the set of small squares intersected by the boundary of Rt. For every t1 and t2, if t_1-t_2 \\\\geq 1/\\\\sqrt{n}, then \\\\operatorname{width}(R_{t_1})-\\\\operatorname{width}(R_{t_2}) \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{width}(R_0)/\\\\sqrt{n}. Therefore there is a gap of at least \\\\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \\\\sqrt{n} between the boundary of Rt1 and the boundary of Rt2. Therefore, intersect(t1) and intersect(t2) are disjoint. Therefore: : \\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\sqrt{n}-1}{\\\\operatorname{intersect}(j/\\\\sqrt{n})} \\\\leq n Therefore by the pigeonhole principle there is a certain j0 for which: : \\\\operatorname{intersect}(j_0/\\\\sqrt{n}) \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n} The separator we look for is the rectangle Rt, where t = j_0/\\\\sqrt{n}.This proof is based on the more general proof of Chan (2003), but with the better constants of Smith&Wormald; (1998). = Application example = Using this separator theorem, we can solve certain problems in computational geometry in the following way: * Separate the input set of squares to two disjoint subsets; * Solve the problem on each subset separately; * Combine the solutions to the two sub-problems and get an approximate solution to the original problem. = Generalizations = The above theorem can be generalized in many different ways, with possibly different constants. For example: * Instead of squares, the input collection can contain arbitrary fat objects, such as: circles, rectangles with a bounded aspect ratio, etc. * Instead of two-dimensional shapes in a plane, the input collection can contain objects of any dimension, and they can be situated in a d-dimensional torus. * Instead of requiring that the shapes in the input collection be disjoint, we can put a weaker requirement, that the collection is: ** k-thick, i.e., each point is covered by at most k different shapes. ** l-k-thick, i.e., each point is covered by at most k different shapes with a size ratio (size of largest shape divided by size of smallest shape) at most l. ** k-overloaded, i.e., for any subcollection of shapes, the sum of their individual measures is at most k times the measure of their union. * Instead of a rectangle separator, the separator can be any shape that can be covered by smaller copies of itself. * Instead of bounding the number of shapes in each side of the separator, it is possible to bound any measure which satisfies certain axioms. = Optimality = The ratio of 1:2, in the square separator theorem above, is the best that can be guaranteed: there are collections of shapes that cannot be separated in a better ratio using a separator that crosses only O(sqrt(n)) shapes. Here is one such collection (from theorem 34 of ): Consider an equilateral triangle. At each of its 3 vertices, put N/3 shapes arranged in an exponential spiral, such that the diameter increases by a constant factor every turn of the spiral, and each shape touches its neighbours in the spiral ordering. For example, start with a 1-by-Œ¶ rectangle, where Œ¶ is the golden ratio. Add an adjacent Œ¶-by-Œ¶ square and get another golden rectangle. Add an adjacent (1+Œ¶)-by-(1+Œ¶) square and get a larger golden rectangle, and so on. Now, in order to separate more than 1/3 of the shapes, the separator must separate O(N) shapes from two different vertices. But to do this, the separator must intersect O(N) shapes.  Separators that are hyperplanes  :: Given a set of N=4k disjoint axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, there is a line, either horizontal or vertical, such that at least N/4 rectangles lie entirely to each side of it (thus at most N/2 rectangles are intersected by the separator line). = Proof = Define W as the most western vertical line with at least N/4 rectangles entirely to its west. There are two cases: * If there are at least N/4 rectangles entirely to the east of W, then W is a vertical separator. * Otherwise, by moving W slightly to the west, we get a vertical line that intersects more than N/2 rectangles. Find a point on this line that has at least N/4 rectangles above and N/4 rectangles below it, and draw a horizontal separator through it. = Optimality = right The number of intersected shapes, guaranteed by the above theorem, is O(N). This upper bound is asymptotically tight even when the shapes are squares, as illustrated in the figure to the right. This is in sharp contrast to the upper bound of O() intersected shapes, which is guaranteed when the separator is a closed shape (see previous section). right Moreover, when the shapes are arbitrary rectangles, there are cases in which no line that separates more than a single rectangle can cross less than N/4 rectangles, as illustrated in the figure to the right. = Generalizations = The above theorem can be generalized from disjoint rectangles to k-thick rectangles. Additionally, by induction on d, it is possible to generalize the above theorem to d dimensions and get the following theorem: :: Given N axis-parallel d-boxes whose interiors are k-thick, there exists an axis-parallel hyperplane such that at least: ::: \\\\lfloor(N+1-k)/(2d)\\\\rfloor :: of the d-box interiors lie to each side of the hyperplane. For the special case when k = N ‚àí 1 (i.e. each point is contained in at most N ‚àí 1 boxes), the following theorem holds: :: Given N axis-parallel d-boxes whose interiors are (N ‚àí 1)-thick, there exists an axis-parallel hyperplane that separates two of them. The objects need not be boxes, and the separators need not be axis-parallel: :: Let C be a collection of possible orientations of hyperplanes (i.e. C = {horizontal,vertical}). Given N d-objects, such that every two disjoint object are separated by a hyperplane with an orientation from C, whose interiors are k-thick, there exists a hyperplane with an orientation from C such that at least: (N + 1 ‚àí k)/O(C) of the d-objects interiors lie entirely to each side of the hyperplane. = Algorithmic versions = It is possible to find the hyperplanes guaranteed by the above theorems in O(Nd) steps. Also, if the 2d lists of the lower and upper endpoints of the intervals defining the boxes's ith coordinates are pre- sorted, then the best such hyperplane (according to a wide variety of optimality measures) may be found in O(Nd) steps.  Separators that are width-bounded strips between parallel hyperplanes  :: Let Q be a set of n points in the plane such that the minimal distance between points is d. Let a>0 be a constant. :: There is a pair of parallel lines of distance a, such that at most 2n/3 points lie to each side of the strip, and at most 1.3 {a \\\\over d} \\\\sqrt{n} points lie inside the strip. :: Equivalently: there is a line such that at most 2n/3 points lie to each side of it and at most 1.3 {a \\\\over d} \\\\sqrt{n} points lie at a distance of less than a/2 from it. = Proof sketch = Define the centerpoint of Q as a point o such that every line through it has at most 2n/3 points of Q in each side of it. The existence of a centerpoint can be proved using Helly's theorem. For a given point p and constant a>0, define Pr(a,p,o) as the probability that a random line through o lies at a distance of less than a from p. The idea is to bound this probability and thus bound the expected number of points at a distance less than a from a random line through o. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one line through o is the desired separator. = Applications = Bounded-width separators can be used for approximately solving the protein folding problem. It can also be used for an exact sub-exponential algorithm to find a maximum independent set, as well as several related covering problems, in geometric graphs.  Geometric separators and planar graph separators  The planar separator theorem may be proven by using the circle packing theorem to represent a planar graph as the contact graph of a system of disks in the plane, and then by finding a circle that forms a geometric separator for those disks..  See also  * Ham sandwich theorem: given n measurable objects in n-dimensional space, it is possible to divide all of them in half (with respect to their measure, i.e. volume) with a single (n ‚àí 1)-dimensional hyperplane. * Other Separation theorems. * Simultaneous separator: a separator that simultaneously separates the shapes in several collections, while simultaneously intersecting a small number of shapes in each collection, may not always exist.

The Evangeliary belongs to a manuscript group which is referred to as the Ada Group or Group of the Vienna Coronation Gospels. It is part of the church treasury of Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel, now Aachen Cathedral, and is today kept in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury. The Treasury Gospels and the more recent Ottonian Liuthar Gospels are the two most significant medieval manuscripts on display there.  Description and classification = Manuscript = The codex, with a format of on 280 parchment leaves, contains the texts of the four Gospels (each with its prologue), the prologue of Jerome (fol. 2r ‚Äì fol. 5r) and the so-called summary of Damasus. They are all written in a single column of Carolingian minuscule, with titles and headings emphasised by the use of Capitalis rustica. A full page miniature (fol. 14v) and twelve pages of canon tables as a concordance (fol. 8v ‚Äì 14r) precede the gospel texts. These are surrounded by architectural decoration, which reflects a late antique model from around AD 400 and, uniquely in all Carolingian illumination, depicts Classical entablatures. It is unusual, among other things, for showing the Four Evangelists on a side in a hilly landscape with a horizon, which creates the illusion of each of the four being in his own room. The landscape lines the horizon line with shadowy, almost silhouetted, trees in front of a rosy evening sky. Through the differing transparencies of the paint, sketches are visible which show that an architectural background in the form of crenellated walls was originally planned. The Evangelists are depicted with white halos in different stages of life from youth to old age and also as personifications of the four temperaments, wearing loose white togae in the manner of ancient philosophers. With a writing lectern before him, Matthew is writing, Mark is dipping his nib in its inkwell, Luke is reading and John is meditating on what has been written. The evangelists are facing away from one another and seem to carry out their work in isolation, but within a single ornate frame (depicted as if decorated with filigree and gemstones) and in a uniform landscape, conveying the idea that the four authors serve a single purpose, each in his own way, namely the proclamation of the Word of God and the Kingdom of God. Reference is also made to the unity and consistency of the four gospels, as written evidence and manifestation of the a unified body of belief: the Christian Good News. Thus, the imagery has complex theological significations, as is the case in most Medieval art. The arrangement of the four evangelists in the four corners of the landscape recalls the four cardinal points. Just as, according to Augustine, these four cardinal points could only form the single world together, the four authors could only form the single gospel together. This unique depiction derives from an artist mixing Greco-Italian themes with Late Antique painting. Excepting the image discussed above and a decorative page with the title of the Gospel of Matthew in gold and silver capitalis rustica on a purple background in an ornamental frame, there are no further miniatures in the manuscript, which is incomplete. The last pages contain the Capitulare Evangeliorum, a list of gospel verses to read at Sunday services and high feasts (fol. 258r). = Cover = Until 1972 a book cover from Ottonian times (c.1020) with goldsmithery and a Byzantine ivory relief from the late tenth century with a depiction of Mary holding Baby Jesus in the centre was bound to the manuscript. This cover probably belonged to an altarpiece donated by Emperor Henry II, to whom the Pala d'Oro in Aachen Cathedral is also attributed. The centre of the cover is an ivory panel, showing the Theotokos as Hodegetria (Way-pointer), one of the five main iconographic types of the Madonna in Eastern Orthodox art. She indicates Christ as the Messiah. The relief is the midpoint of ridges with gemstones and Cloisonn√© extending in horizontal and vertical axes to form a Crux gemmata. The Hodegetria is framed above and below by four gold sheets in Repouss√© relief with scenes from the Life of Christ: the Nativity, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the Ascension. The four Evangelists' symbols appear on the left and right of these scenes, at about a third the size of the scenes from the Life of Christ, in golden Repouss√©. These eight reliefs are stylistically very similar to those of the Pala d'Oro in Aachen Cathedral, so they were most likely created by a single goldsmithery, probably in Fulda.Ernst G√ºnther Grimme, Der Aachener Domschatz. Schwann, D√ºsseldorf 1973, p. 10. The outer area of the cover contains a wide trimming, richly decorated with gemstones and filigree In its layout, the book cover stands in the tradition of Carolingian illumination. Probably, this Ottonian book cover replaced an older Carolingian cover. Chronologically and stylistically, it is closest to that of the Codex aureus Epternacensis. In the nineteenth century, the binding was redone. At that time, the gold relief was pushed in and as a result the symbols of Matthew and Mark were swapped.  Bibliography  * Frauke Steenbock.

The hypoventilation technique consists of short breath holdings and can be performed in different types of exercise: running, cycling, swimming, rowing, skating, etc. Generally, there are two ways to carry out hypoventilation: at high lung volume or at low lung volume. At high lung volume, breath holdings are performed with the lungs full of air (inhalation then breath hold). Conversely, during hypoventilation at low lung volume, breath holdings are performed with the lung half full of air. To do so, one has to first exhale normally, without forcing, then hold one‚Äôs breath. This is called the exhale-hold technique. The scientific studies have shown that only hypoventilation at low lung volume could lead to both a significant decrease in oxygen (O2) concentrations in the body and an increase in carbon dioxide concentrations (CO2), which are indispensable for the method to be effective.  History  The first known form of hypoventilation occurred in the 1950s during training of the runners of Eastern Europe and former USSR.Xavier Woorons, \\"Hypoventilation training, push your limits!\\", Arpeh, 2014, p. 21 () One of the most famous athletes to have used this method is Emil Z√°topek, the Czech long-distance runner, 4 times Olympic gold medalist and former holder of 18 world records. Z√°topek, who was a precursor in training, regularly used to run by holding his breath in order to harden his training and simulate the conditions of competition. However, at that time, the effects of hypoventilation training were completely unknown and the method was applied very empirically. At the beginning of the 1970s, American swim coach James Counsilman used a new training technique which involved taking a limited number of inhalations while swimming laps in a pool. The effect of this kind of training was determined to decrease the body‚Äôs O2 content and simulate altitude training. Due to the method's efficacy, hypoventilation became a common training method for many swimmers. It is especially from the 1980s that the scientific studies on exercise with reduced breathing frequency began to be published. While the method advocated by Counsilman attracted a following in some runners and athletics coaches, the results of the studies contradicted the hypotheses put forward by the World of Sport. They showed that this training method did not decrease body O2 concentrations and provoked only a hypercapnic effect, i.e. an increase in CO2 concentrations. Both the effectiveness and legitimacy of hypoventilation training were strongly challenged. Since the middle of the 2000s, a series of studies has been conducted by French researchers of Paris 13 University to propose a new approach to hypoventilation training. Dr Xavier Woorons and his team hypothesized that if breath holdings were carried out with the lungs half-full of air, rather than full of air as performed so far, it would be possible to significantly reduce body oxygenation. The results that were published confirmed the hypotheses. They demonstrated that through hypoventilation at low lung volume, that is the exhale-hold technique, it was possible, without leaving sea level, to decrease O2 concentrations in the blood and in the muscles at levels corresponding to altitudes above 2000 m.  Physiological effects  When exercise is being performed, if the exhale-hold technique is properly applied, a decrease in O2 concentrations and an increase in CO2 concentrations occur in the lungs, the blood and the muscles. The combined effect of hypoxia and hypercapnia act as a strong stimulus whose main consequence is to increase lactic acid and hydrogen ions production, and therefore to provoke a strong acidosis in the body. Thus, during exercise with hypoventilation, the blood and muscle acid-base homeostasis is highly disturbed. The studies have also reported an increase in all heart activity when hypoventilation is carried out in terrestrial sports. Cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume and sympathetic modulation to the heart are greater when exercise with hypoventilation is performed in running or cycling. A slightly higher blood pressure has also been recorded. In swimming on the other hand, no significant change in the heart activity has been found. After several weeks of hypoventilation training, physiological adaptations occur that delay the onset of acidosis during a maximal exertion test. The studies have shown that at a given workload, pH and blood bicarbonate concentrations were higher, whereas lactate concentrations had a tendency to decrease. The reduction in acidosis would be due to an improvement in buffer capacity at the muscle level. However, no change advantageous to aerobic metabolism has been found. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), the number of red blood cells and the anaerobic threshold were not modified after hypoventilation training.  Benefits of the method  By delaying acidosis, hypoventilation training would also delay the onset of fatigue and would therefore improve performance during strenuous exertions of short to moderate durations. After several weeks of hypoventilation training, performance gains between 1 and 4% have been reported in running and swimming. The method could be interesting to use in sports requiring strenuous repeated or continuous exertions, whose duration does not exceed a dozen minutes: swimming, middle-distance running, cycling, combat sports, team sports, racquet sports, etc. Another advantage of hypoventilation training is to stimulate the anaerobic metabolism without using high exercise intensities, which are more traumatizing for the locomotor system and therefore increase the risk of injuries. Athletes who return progressively to their sporting activity after being injured, and who therefore have to protect their muscles, joints or tendons, could train at low or moderate intensity with hypoventilation.  Disadvantages of the method  Hypoventilation training is physically demanding. This method is intended for highly motivated athletes, who do not have pulmonary or cardiovascular issues and whose primary objective is performance. Furthermore, exercising with hypoventilation can provoke headaches if the breath holdings are maintained too long or repeated over a too long period of time. Finally, this training method does not seem to be beneficial for endurance sports.

Biography  Ravenna's artistic life began in 1914, with the making of some drawings. During World War I, he was at battlefront and produced some sketches, then collected and published in the autobiography \\"Una vita per la pittura\\".Goldin M., \\"Juti Ravenna, dipinti 1920-1950, catalogo mostra Ca' dei Carraresi\\", 1992 Thanks to a visit to Florence, during a permit, he came in contact with artistic environment and in particular with works by Ardengo Soffici which showed him the Impressionism painting. Since 1920 he moved to Venice and attended the ‚ÄúAccademia di Belle Arti‚Äù. He began showing in 1921, and met Gino Rossi, Enrico Fonda e Pio Semeghini who became one of his good friends and who made three different portraits of his. He began painting in Burano together with painter Seibezzi. In 1924 Nino Barbantini set up a personal exhibit of Ravenna in the ‚ÄùOpera Bevilacqua La Masa show‚Äù in Ca' Pesaro. Then he showed in the Ca' Pesaro exhibits, in the quadrennial exhibits and in the most important exhibits in Italy and abroad, also winning several prices. He also showed at Venice Biennale in 1928, 1930, 1932, 1934, 1948, 1950 and 1972.Dal sito eugeniodavenezia.eu.it ll discepolo \\"Mr Ravenna tendency in that moment was close to Venetian post-impressionism.‚Äù Mesirca G., \\"Pittura di Juti Ravenna\\", La Provincia di Treviso, maggio-giugno 1962, pag. 32 During his job Ravenna constantly contributed to several magazines with texts and designs. Also he helped the Italian editorial renewal and looked after the printing of some books. With the help of Egidio Bonfante in 1943, he published the book 50 disegni di Picasso, and the book Arte Cubista, two years later. Ravenna has always been suggested by the Venetian lagoon background and in particular by Treviso lands. So in 1948 he left Venice (the attic in Palazzo Carminati) and moved to Treviso, town he loved, where a lot of friends of his in the cultural environment were living (Giovanni Comisso, Sante Cancian ‚Äì died in 1947 -, Toni Perolo, Nevra Garatti); in Treviso he married Cancian widow and son Luciano was born. In 1951 he won (together with Virgilio Guidi) the Premio Burano.

It is the only member of the genus Subcoccinella. It has the typical, almost semi-spherical, ladybird shape and is patterned with spots. However it differs from many of the well-known ladybirds in being neither smooth and shiny nor an eater of aphids: the wing-cases look velvety and it eats fungal moulds on plants. Names The common names for this insect in many languages follow the binomial name and mention that it has twenty-four spots,Wikispecies:Subcoccinella vigintiquatuorpunctata but in English there is great variation in how this is written, with little consensus over the use of words or numerals, capitalisation, placement of hyphens and whether to use \\"spot\\", \\"spotted\\", \\"point\\" or \\"pointed\\"; \\"ladybird\\", \\"ladybird beetle\\" or \\"ladybug\\". There is even disagreement about the spelling of the Latin \\"vigintiquatuorpunctata\\" with some authoritative UK lists preferring a double \\"t\\": \\"vigintiquattuopunctata\\". For ease it is often written \\"Subcoccinella 24-punctata\\". Given the multitude of name formations, it is probably best to use just the genus \\"Subcoccinella\\" when carrying out a web search for information about this insect to avoid missing texts that use variant spellings - it's the only species in the genus. In the US it is also known as the \\"Alfalfa Lady Beetle\\", though rarely found on alfalfa in North America. Description The adult 24-spot is a small ladybird, usually 3 to 4 mm long. It has the quintessential ladybird shape, quite domed with the sides forming a smooth curve from head to pronotum to wing-cases. The wing-cases are covered with short pale hairs, and though these are hard to see without a hand lens, they give the ladybird a distinctive matt appearance. The ladybird is dark orange, including legs and antennae. There are black spots on the wing cases. These vary in number and size but there are often about 20 to 24 and usually no more than 26. Sometimes spots are joined together or they can be absent completely. Dark (melanic) forms are very rare. Another extremely rare form has yellow spots. Larvae are 4 to 6mm long and pale grey-green with darker speckles. They are covered with branched spines. These spines are also present in the pupa, enabling the pupa to secrete noxious alkaloids as a defence against predators. There are five European species in the Epilachninae subfamily, all herbivorous and somewhat hairy. The 24-spot Ladybird can be distinguished from the similarly patterned Bryony Ladybird - Henosepilachna argus (6 to 8 mm) by its small size (3 to 4 mm). Cynegetis impunctata, another small ladybird, is browner and has no spots. It also has a black head and this separates it from the form of the 24-spot Ladybird without spots. This ladybird usually has no wings under the elytra (wing cases) and these individuals are unable to fly. A study found no winged specimens in a UK sample whereas 40% of those from Hungary and Romania had wings. However, as even the winged specimens carried the gene that causes atrophy, it is thought that winglessness is a trend that will increase. Distribution This ladybird is an Old World species occurring across Europe, North Africa, European Russia, the Caucasus, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia, Western Asia, Afghanistan, Mongolia, China, North and South Korea.N.

It also has a pecan orchard. Location It is located off of the east side of Mississippi Highway 553 four miles south of Church Hill. It adjoins the Oakwood Plantation. The Hunt Family of Jefferson County, MS: Genealogy and History History Woodland Plantation was created when James G. Wood, who lived on his 1,000 acre Auburn Plantation in Church Hill, Jefferson County, Mississippi, was in the process of setting up each of his children with their own, nearby, cotton growing operations. Oak Grove, The Cedars, Lagonia and Woodland were four of these properties. Woodland belonged to James' son Robert Y. Wood. Robert bought the first 224 acres to form Woodland in 1837 for $18,000, and soon built his residence on the plantation. He married Virginia P. Smith of New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1839. Robert purchased the final six acres of the plantation in 1858. By 1860 Robert had 34 slaves in Jefferson County. 1864 U.S.C.S. Chart of the Mississippi River Grand Gulf to New Carthage ( shows Woods Plantation - Ursino) - Geographicus - MissRive2Col- USCS-1864 Robert also had Ursino Plantation in Warren County, Mississippi that he ran with the help of his brother Edgar. Ursino was formed in 1836 when James Wood and his son Robert purchased a total of 2,083 acres at Davis Bend, located south of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River, for $103,390. This land was bought from James' friend Joseph Emory Davis of Hurricane Plantation. Ursino adjoined Jefferson Davis' Brierfield Plantation which in turn bordered Hurricane Plantation. By 1842 Ursino had 30 head of cattle and 60 slaves. In 1860 Robert had 132 slaves in Warren County. The relationship between the Davis brothers and the Wood brothers became strained over the years, because the Wood brothers would not maintain the levees at Ursino Plantation. By the 1861 outbreak of the Civil War, overseers ran Ursino and the Wood brothers lived in Jefferson County. Edgar Wood married David Hunt's son Abijah's widow and moved to Calviton Plantation in Jefferson County, Mississippi. Due to financial difficulty immediately after the Civil War in 1866, Robert sold Woodland Plantation for $10,000 to Ann L. Foster. In 1871 Robert was bankrupt, and he sold Ursino Plantation for $100,000 to Ben Montgomery - a former slave from Hurricane Plantation. Robert and his wife Virginia moved to Woodburn in the Church Hill area until their deaths in 1882. Woodburn was the plantation of Robert's brother Walter Wood. Somehow, Ann Foster's daughter (Mary A. Foster Lloyd) owned Woodland by 1879. In that year Mary defaulted on a loan and had to transfer ownership of Woodland to Jefferson College in Washington, Adams County, Mississippi, who had provided her financing. From 1889 to 1936 the plantation had several owners and became badly run down. In 1889 Ann L. Foster purchased Woodland for a second time - from Jefferson College for $1,800. In about 1910 the boll weevil destroyed the local cotton farming, which had been the main crop since before the Civil War when slaves worked the land. After cotton farming ended, Woodland is known to have primarily been used to grow hay to supply the neighborhood cattle and to grow pecans. In 1936, Philip Heath Marble (1890‚Äì1965) purchased Woodland Plantation and restored it. His daughter, Phyllis Marble, lived there until she sold it in 1974. Architecture The architectural style of the plantation house is at once Gothic Revival and Greek Revival. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since February 22, 1979. The house is one and a half stories. The house originally had a front and rear gallery, which also connected to the separate kitchen building. A 35 by 15 foot center hall had two 19 by 19 foot rooms on each side. Two of these rooms had marble fireplace mantles and two had wooden mantles. The first floor rooms had 12 and 1/2 foot high ceilings, pocket doors between the front and back parlor, and jib doors under some of the windows to provide direct access to the galleries. A stairway in the center hall rose to the second (1/2) floor, which was originally just one big room.

Miller led his union‚Äôs successful effort to secure fair wages, improve working conditions and better benefits for its members and safety reforms for the riding public. New York City Council Miller was elected in the 2013 New York City Council elections, securing the Democratic nomination from a crowded field of six candidates and then winning the general election with 96.9% of the vote. Miller is currently the only Muslim on the Council. After his first election, he was appointed chair of the City Council Committee on Civil Service and Labor. Miller also became a member of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus and the Progressive Caucus. In March 2014 Miller was named to the Council's new Policy Working Group. In 2016, Miller was arrested with Council Member Inez Barron and 41 others during a union protest outside Governor Cuomo's Midtown office demanding a state budget that includes \\"adequate funding for CUNY and a fair contract for its Professional Staff Congress\\". In 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed two measures introduced by Miller aimed at reining in so-called dollar vans that are either unlicensed or break city laws while operating legally. In partnership with Council Member Donovan Richards, Miller also helped bring $426 million in capital investments to expand access to the New York City sewer system over several years starting in 2014. Miller has been a vocal opponent of the Governor's proposed congestion pricing in New York City, even writing an Op-Ed condemning the idea wholeheartedly. Following Hurricane Maria, Miller joined his NYC Council colleagues to Puerto Rico to survey the damage caused by the hurricane. In 2017, Miller was re-elected to the New York City Council over his Democratic Primary challenger Anthony Rivers and Sondra Peeden. After his re-election, he was continued to serve as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Service and Labor.

He was ordained to the priesthood for the Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross (commonly known as the Crosiers) on May 31, 1958 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1961, he earned a master's degree in cultural anthropology from Catholic University of America. The following year, he became a missionary serving the Asmat people of the Agats region of southwestern Papua, Indonesia on the island of New Guinea, where he taught himself the Asmat language, and worked to eliminate the practice of headhunting and to preserve Asmat culture and art. He founded a church in the town of Sawa Erma on the Unir River. On May 29, 1969, he was appointed bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Agats, Indonesia and was ordained on November 29, 1969. He opposed the exploitation and cultural suppression of the Asmat by foreign logging companies and the military. Sowada wrote books on Asmat art and culture and collected hundreds of artifacts. Common interest in the Asmat culture led to friendships with other collectors and archivists of Asmat art including Michael Rockefeller and the artist Tobias Schneebaum, who described Sowada as having a \\"round, cherubic face\\" and said that \\"I liked him immediately.\\" Sowada was instrumental in founding the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress in Agats in 1973, described by the artist Tobias Schneebaum as \\"a museum designed for the local people, not the nonexistent tourist.\\" After Sowada's retirement and return to the United States, his collection of Asmat artifacts formed the core of the American Museum of Asmat Art, located since 2012 at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. He also co-edited a 2002 book about the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress's collections, Asmat: Perception of Life in Art.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 19 Nov. 2009 The case reached the Supreme Court when Grove City College disagreed with the Department of Education's assertion that it was required to comply with Title IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving Basic Educational Opportunity Grants through a Department of Education program. The Department of Education's stance was that, because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was receiving federal assistance and Title IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program, only that program had to be in compliance. The ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title IX, as it made many institutions' sports programs outside of the rule of Title IX and, thus, reduced the scope of Title IX.Suggs, Welsh.

Career The Honourable Bernard Eric Edward Barrington, youngest son of William Barrington, 6th Viscount Barrington, was educated at Eton College and joined the Foreign Office (FCO) in 1867. He was Private Secretary to two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, Arthur Otway and Viscount Enfield, 1868‚Äì1874. In 1874 he became pr√©cis writer to the Foreign Secretary, the Earl of Derby, and continued under Derby's successor, Lord Salisbury. He accompanied Salisbury to the Congress of Berlin in 1878 and was given the diplomatic rank of Second Secretary for the purpose. When Salisbury became Prime Minister for the first time in 1885, Barrington became Principal Private Secretary to the new Foreign Secretary, Lord Iddesleigh, 1885‚Äì86. He was Principal Private Secretary to Lord Salisbury (in his role as Foreign Secretary) in 1886‚Äì92 and 1895‚Äì1900, and then to the Marquess of Lansdowne 1900‚Äì05. When Sir Edward Grey succeeded Lord Lansdowne as Foreign Secretary in December 1905 Barrington was appointed Assistant Under-Secretary for Africa, but retired in July 1907. :Save during the short period when he was attached to the special British Embassy that attended the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the whole career of Sir Eric Barrington was passed in the Foreign Office. He was a distinguished representative of the class of higher permanent officials who are the custodians of tradition and the wardens of continuity in the great Departments of State. The public at large knows little or nothing of their work. From time to time their names appear as the recipients of a C.B. or a K.C.B., but their contact with the world, outside the walls of their office, is limited and intermittent. Their names and qualities are, as a rule, far better known to foreign Governments and to foreign diplomatists than to their own fellow-countrymen. Their reward consists in the confidence of their chiefs and the esteem of their colleagues. Though they sometimes wield great influence, they have no direct responsibility, and the chief guarantee against any misuse of their powers lies in their own patriotism and conscientiousness. -- The Times, 26 February 1918 Barrington was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1889 Birthday Honours. He was promoted to a Knight Commander (KCB) in the order in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and received the knighthood in a private audience with King Edward VII on 2 August, during the King‚Ä≤s convalescence on board HMY Victoria and Albert.

She is giving a speech to a neurological convention. As she speaks we cut away to scenes with her doctor, phone calls from her estranged daughter, and arguments with her husband who may or may not be divorcing her. Through it all she constantly refers to \\"the other place\\", a cottage on Cape Cod that the family once owned, and a place where Juliana feels she may reunite with her missing daughter and find some peace of mind. Juliana becomes argumentative with everyone around her and appears increasingly confused. The phone calls from the missing daughter may be a delusion. Juliana believes that she has a brain tumor and says that her mother and other relatives all died of brain tumors at an early age. Eventually Juliana actually visits the other place and encounters the current owner whom she mistakenly believes to be her daughter. The woman is initially hostile and has problems of her own. But soon the two women find mutual comfort as Juliana's husband arrives to take her home.

These are the Fables who live in New York. Bigby WolfSnow WhiteBeauty and the Beast Still together after nearly a thousand years, Beauty and Beast escaped from the Homelands with barely more than the clothes they were wearing. Both set up in relatively low-paid jobs, Beast maintaining the Fabletown buildings and Beauty working in a bookshop, earning between them enough to make ends meet, but little more. Their lives were hampered somewhat by Beast's tendency to shift back and forth between his human and beastly forms depending on his wife's mood towards him, but the two were nevertheless a loving couple. With the election of Prince Charming to Mayor of Fabletown during the events of The Mean Seasons, their lives took a turn for the better; as neither Bigby Wolf or Snow White were willing to work alongside Charming, their positions became vacant and the Prince offered Beauty and Beast the available jobs. Beast, now Sheriff, allied himself with Frau Totenkinder, the most powerful witch in Fabletown and finally had his curse fixed, allowing him to transform into his Beast form at will. Whether he's aware that it was Totenkinder who inflicted the curse on him in the first place is unknown; this occurred pre-amnesty, so he would be legally unable to retaliate if he wanted to. While initially reeling at the complexities of the job (much of what Bigby did was covert and unknown to the general Fable population), he has grown into the job and appears to even enjoy it. Beauty took Snow's position as Deputy Mayor, and has learned to cope with all of the responsibility. Early in her tenure, Prince Charming tried to seduce her, but she refused him, threatening to send her husband after him if he tried again. It is notable that Beauty realized, as a result of remarks made by Prince Charming during this seduction attempt, that her actions and words toward her husband were not generally as kind as she herself perceived; she subsequently resolved to be nicer to Beast. After the arrival in Fabletown of the Imperial Emissary, Lord Hansel, during the Sons of Empire story-arc, and the subsequent need to keep track of both him and his staff, Beast asked for, and was given, additional funding and manpower, plus was later assigned zephyrs, provided by Bigby Wolf's father, the North Wind, to act as spies. During the war against the Empire, as depicted in the War and Pieces arc, Beast remained in Fabletown, commanding the troops stationed there in case of a retaliatory assault by the Empire. According to the answers given in the Burning Questions issue, both ask Frau Totenkinder what it is she's knitting. When she answers she's knitting a garment for their firstborn child. To which Beauty laughs saying she's not even expecting, to which Frau answered \\"All things in time\\" and then offered to show them the progress of her knitting. Upon hearing them agree, she presented them a cute light greenish-blue footed pajamas with a lion head sewn on the front. In addition that the footed pajamas had four arms, two legs, and a place for a tail, indicating that their child might be a monster or at least have Beast's transformation problem. Upon seeing her work, this left both Beast and Beauty flabbergasted. However, Frau's predication is shown to be possible. As shown in the Great Fables Cross Over, after having a brief argument with Beast about his behavior with Bigby, Beauty and her husband are shown in their tent together having makeup sex. While Beast was very happy from it, Beauty herself couldn't help but feel that there was something more special about and perhaps magical. Later on in a next issue, she's revealed to be pregnant. The child is a couple of week premature, but Beauty comes with the birth with a few complications. The child, a little girl is named Bliss and appeared to be born normal. However, as Frau had predicted, sometime later it is shown that when she becomes angry, she undergoes a transformation into a six limbed, tailed beast. Since the birth of little Bliss, her father has not been able to transform into his beastly form. When looked over by Ozma with her powers, she could not detect any trace of his ancient curse. In Fables 143 (the third chapter of the Happily Ever After story arc), it is confirmed that the Beast's daughter has adopted his curse as her own. She might have also inherited from her mother's powers (the snake Lamia). In the Fairest story Lamia, it is revealed that Beauty hides a dark secret. She is in fact a lamia who was driven from her home after a man got her in the family way. The man's wife had some friends run Lamia out of town. They followed her to another world, where Lamia met a beautiful woman. Lamia, having so recently been abused for beauty's sake, hated the woman on sight and killed her, because \\"everything beautiful leads to ruin in the end\\". Lamia then took the woman's form in order to adopt her peaceful and simple way of life. She kept the form so long that the woman's personality became her own and she became what she was merely pretending to be. She met Beast, and they fell in love. But every few decades, Beauty becomes herself again and becomes Lamia. Every time, Beast tries to catch her in time and lock her away. But sometimes she escapes, and embarks on a killing rampage, targeting rapists and men who abuse women (going after innocents is \\"not her style\\"). Every time, Beast assumes the identities of famous heroes of detective fiction (such as Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe) and has to play detective and stop her before the mundy authorities can catch her (the fictional identities he assumed may or may not indicate Lamia has already managed to escape to the United Kingdom and France, as well as the United States of America). Bigby Wolf has already threatened Beast to deal with the matter permanently - even if it means killing Beast as well. Beauty never remembers the incidents afterward and Beast never told her the truth (though he tried to write her a letter at least once with a typewriter). Strangely, Beast is capable of transforming at will in that story - decades before Frau Totenkinder allows him to do so (although she may have sold him a charm or a potion for the duration of his mission, as she has occasionally done for other Fables). Nowadays, Beast is considering making a new home for himself, his wife and their daughter in Flycatcher's kingdom in the Homelands, because Beauty will be safer there, as the \\"mundy\\" police keeps getting better and better at investigating and collecting evidence, and will catch Beauty sooner or later. The story's ending suggests that Beauty may be turning into Lamia again sometime in the near future. However, in the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All The Lands, Lamia is gone for good: Beauty becomes the victim of a serial killer, and even though Beauty is brought back to life, Lamia is not. Trusty John The doorman at the Woodland building, Trusty John was almost universally popular. Amiable and good-natured, John enjoyed his job and was always pleased to see everybody. As such, it came as a complete shock to everyone when Kay unmasked John as a spy for the Adversary. Baffled as to how the 'most faithful Fable in history' could turn against them, John was interrogated by Prince Charming, Beauty and Beast; he explained to them that, long before signing up to the Fabletown compact, he had sworn an unbreakable vow of loyalty to his King, who he believed had been killed leading his forces against the Adversary. It turned out that this had not been the case, that his King, now working for the Adversary, had contacted John and ordered him to spy on his fellow Fables. Bound by his vow, which overruled the later compact, John had no choice but to obey and spent the next four years passing information to the enemy before Kay, with newly regrown eyes, caught him. Despite being sorely tempted to forgive him, given the circumstances, Charming realised that treason, no matter what the situation, must be dealt with harshly. Hardening his heart, he gave John the option to jump down the Witching Well under his own power as a gesture of mercy, the alternative being that he would be executed on the spot and his corpse put down there anyway. John accepted the former offer. Few people explicitly know what happened to him, as revealing such a beloved Fable to be a traitor was deemed to be bad for the morale of Fabletown. On his mission into The Witching Well, as depicted in the story-arc The Good Prince, Flycatcher recruited John as his squire, offering him the possibility of redemption by accompanying him. Following the completion of his quest, Flycatcher, now King Ambrose of Haven, announced that John would henceforth be known as Trusty John once more, and appointed him to be Lord High Chancellor of the kingdom, putting him in charge of the day-to-day running of the new realm. Grimble The security guard at the Woodland apartment building that forms the centre of Fabletown, Grimble is the troll from the tale of the Three Billy Goats Gruff and quite possibly many other tales where a troll features. He has possession of an expensive glamour spell. He has been shown to assume troll form for battle. During the Fall of Fabletown due to the actions of Mister Dark, it is Grimble who snaps King Cole out of his melancholy and encourages him to carry on. It is also he who motivates the former mayor during the evacuation to Haven after Mister Dark discovers the location of the Farm. He was turned into a harmless bird by Prince Brandish/Werian Holt when he began to unravel behind his alias. It is unknown if it is a permanent spell or a temporary one, since Brandish didn't want Grimble to reveal that he and Mrs. Sprat weren't Mr. Dark's prisoners. Bufkin A winged monkey from the Oz tales, Bufkin acts as Fabletown's librarian and thus is generally found in the cavernous business office, where he both works and sleeps. Close to Boy Blue, he hid for a week when his friend left for the Homelands, thinking that he would be blamed for not stopping him. Bufkin lacks wisdom, although he is certainly not stupid, is occasionally mischievous and prone to drinking heavily and stealing the Mayor's booze, nevertheless he is generally a good worker and rarely complains. During the events of the Storybook Love arc, when everybody was out of the office, Bufkin came to the conclusion that he was now in charge and decided to rename Fabletown Bufkintown, a change that only lasted as long as it took somebody else to find out about it. He apparently reads a lot of the books in the library, and it is suggested that he has learned skills like lockpicking from this. On learning this Prince Charming threatened to kill Bufkin if he stole his alcohol again, Bufkin is then seen with another book‚Äîone relating to Political assassination. After the magics holding Fabletown together have been unravelled he was stranded in the business office along with all the formerly imprisoned fables. During this time he was able to bottle the Djinn and kill Baba Yaga and her knights by utilizing everything he has read (in this volume, several indirect allusions to the Wicked Witch of the West are made). He was aided by the Magic Mirror, Frankenstein's monster's head, the Barleycorn maidens and several heads of the captured wooden soldiers. After this, Bufkin climbs the Business Office's tree and finds himself in Ev (a neighbor to the Land of Oz). He is accompanied by Lily, one of the Barleycorn maidens who has a huge crush on him. While sitting in one of Ev's magic lunch box trees, he accidentally rescues a group of Oz-Fables from the Nome King enforcers. Bufkin then forms a resistance movement in order to overthrow the evil Nome King. Afterward, he, Lily and Hangy - a hanging rope which Lily brought to life, had many adventures in many different worlds before his as well as Lily retirement and death. It is also stated that he had become Lily's husband three times thanks to a mad scientist experiment, a wishing fork and a transformation gas and has many children in the species which they transform into which includes flying monkeys, Barleycorn and Korob birds. Prince Charming Although charming and handsome, Prince Charming is a pathological womanizer, a liar and an all-around rogue. He was also raised as a prince, to understand sacrifice necessary to be an effective leader, and the kind of king that sacrifices all to safeguard his subjects. His (known) previous wives in chronological order were Snow White, Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) and Cinderella; the latter two of his ex-wives were introduced to him by their shared fairy godmother. It is also revealed in the Jack of Fables' comic that Prince Charming is Jack Horner's father. It is most likely that Charming never knew of their relations to one another. He lived in Europe after leaving the Homelands, living off the kindness of various nobles and ex-nobles. He returned to Fabletown just prior to Rose Red's \\"murder\\". He hatched an intricate scheme, killing Bluebeard in a duel during the Storybook Love arc, putting Bluebeard's substantial wealth directly into Fabletown's treasury, then, during the events of March of the Wooden Soldiers and The Mean Seasons, successfully running for the position of Mayor of Fabletown against Old King Cole, so he would have access to those funds. Unfortunately, he made some false presumptions (and thus promises) and had a difficult time in office with public opinion turning against him. Following his victory, he appointed Beauty and Beast to the positions of Deputy Mayor and Sheriff respectively. Spending a large amount of time with Beauty on the job, he attempted to begin an affair with her; she rejected his advances, threatening to set Beast on him if he persisted. In spite of his persistent unfaithfulness, Prince Charming has a good side few are aware of. During the Storybook Love story-arc, he expressed deep regret that his betrayal of Snow White hurt her so badly, and took it upon himself to kill Bluebeard partly because he knew Bluebeard planned to murder Bigby Wolf, whom Snow had grown fond of. Before the Battle of Fabletown in March of the Wooden Soldiers, he supervised building the barricades, then fought bravely during the battle itself, defying the gun-carrying wooden soldiers while armed with a sword. In the battle's aftermath, he led the firefighters that went into the damaged buildings to extinguish the last blazes. Despite the fact that he took the job of mayor primarily for its economic benefits, he eventually dedicated himself sincerely to the duties of mayor, including setting up defenses for Fabletown against the Adversary and, in the Happily Ever After arc, giving Bigby Wolf land next to the farm in order to live with his new wife, Snow White, and their children. In the run-up to the war against the Empire, Charming resigned as Mayor, returning the job to King Cole, in order to focus on the war effort. During the War and Pieces storyline, he held the position of Combat Commander on the skyship Glory of Baghdad built by the Arabian Fables and commanded by Sinbad, running the offensive and defensive operations of the ship during the war and the Glory's mission to bomb the gates connecting the Imperial homeworld to the rest of the Empire. After the Glory's destruction, Charming, despite serious injuries, dragged a bomb by foot to the last remaining gate, with Sinbad accompanying him to defend against hostile forces. Arriving at their destination against considerable opposition, Charming dragged the bomb into the gatesite, stating that he would set the longest fuse possible to give himself the best opportunity to get clear of the blast. Charming failed to emerge before the bomb detonated. His body was never found, and a coffin containing his uniform, medals and some personal effects was buried at the Farm cemetery in absentia. A statue of Charming in Fabletown is dedicated to his memory. In 1001 Nights of Snowfall, a prequel to the Fables series, the real reason Prince Charming cheated on Snow White with Rose Red in the first place was given. Contrary to popular belief, he had not yet known of his inability to remain faithful in marriage. By request of a wedding gift, he taught Snow fencing lessons and had taken charge of investigating a series of murders around the kingdom (the victims were revealed to be the Seven Dwarves). He states one of the violent of prisoners did it and had him executed. This kept peace with the dwarves. He had known it was really Snow White, as the sword wounds indicated progressive swordsmanship. Because he had lost his trust in her, he had Rose Red move in with them in the castle, and shortly after, cheated on Snow with Rose Red, revealed in the Rose Red story arc to be a result of Rose Red seducing him, despite his initial resistance. Theories both on and off the page speculate that he gives off powerful/magic pheromones, which are responsible for his strong ability to seduce nearly any woman he wishes. According to the answers given in the Burning Questions issue, Prince Charming had no less than 1,412 romantic conquests by the age of fifteen. He stated that he is able to win any courtship, be it that of a single woman, or a political election. In the Fairest story arc The Return of the Maharajah, it is revealed that Charming survived his injuries. Nathoo (from Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book) found him and brought Charming to the Indu (the Homelands version of India), where he was nursed back to health. Because Charming is a popular Fable, his wounds healed quickly. He soon became the leader of a group of villages which joined forces in order to overthrow the Maharajah. Charming then became Maharajah Charming, after killing the original Maharajah. Charming eventually relinquishes his title, and decides to go back to Fabletown. His story will be continued in the pages of Fables. Cinderella Prince Charming's third wife, Cinderella is often seen as loud and rambunctious by her fellow Fables, and usually goes simply by the name Cindy. She is the owner and manager of her own shoe store, the Glass Slipper, in Fabletown. This is her first job, and possibly main income, but she also has another important job: she secretly works for the Sheriff (first Bigby Wolf and then later Beast) as one of his off-the-record spies. Cinderella was recruited as his off-the-books agent shortly after her arrival in the mundane world, approximately two centuries prior to the present-day setting of the comics. Missions shown have included seducing Ichabod Crane in Paris to get him to reveal that he was willing to turn traitor and provide valuable intelligence to the Adversary. She served as an envoy to giants of the Cloud Kingdoms, aiming to forge an alliance with them, a mission that ultimately put her in debt to Frau Totenkinder, but that also cleared the way for Bigby Wolf's covert insertion into the Homelands depicted in Happily Ever After, a mission where Cinderella served as his briefing officer. She also participated in the interrogation of the wooden soldiers captured after the Battle of Fabletown, and later helped with the interrogation of Baba Yaga. Cinderella considers herself to be the finest secret agent who has ever lived, on the grounds that, being immortal, she has had multiple human lifespans to perfect her craft and, uniquely among Fables, has had access not only to the magical resources of the Fables, but also all the technologies and techniques perfected by the mundane population. Her public persona is loud, brash and carefree, with most of her fellow Fables dismissing her as a shallow and largely irresponsible playgirl. On a mission, however, Cinderella is calm, calculating and frequently ruthless, displaying no qualms about killing when required. She has had a long vendetta with Dorothy Gale, both on a physical and ideological level. Whereas Dorothy was a mercenary motivated by the thrill of murder and chaos, Cinderella is motivated by duty and pragmatism. After finally defeating Dorothy, Cinderella took her magical slippers as bounty, and is now presumably also able to use them for assuming disguises. Old King Cole Cole's realm was easily overwhelmed by the Adversary's forces. Only with the assistance of his loyal and loving subjects, was he able to hide in the woods and survive long enough to reach Earth. As Mayor of Fabletown since its foundation, Old King Cole preferred to leave the actual running of the place to Snow White, his deputy, focusing more on the more ceremonial and formal aspects of the role himself, an arrangement that generally worked well. He was eventually challenged for the position by Prince Charming who won after making a series of rash promises that he would prove to be unable to keep. Leaving the Mayor's penthouse apartment, he briefly roomed with Boy Blue, who had lost his roommate Pinocchio during the Adversary's assault on Fabletown. He then moved into Beauty and the Beast's home, they themselves moved into Snow White's old place. A well-meaning and amiable man, King Cole found his defeat profoundly depressing. However, when the Arabian Fables arrived in Fabletown, Cole found renewed importance as one of the few Fables fluent in Arabic, and his diplomatic acumen led to a close friendship with Sinbad. Before this, Cole had been portrayed as a figurehead whose primary duty was glad-handling Fabletown's budget; his diplomatic sessions showed a shrewdness and cunning that he had not displayed before then. He has since become the ambassador to Fabletown East in Baghdad. He returned to Fabletown briefly to preside over the wedding of Snow White and Bigby Wolf. At the start of the war with the Empire Prince Charming resigned his position as mayor, returning the job to King Cole. Cole remained mayor after the war and, as before, delegated official duties over to the Deputy Mayor, who was now Beauty. When Mister Dark escaped his imprisonment, the enchantments upon Fabletown began to fade and caused the entire building structure to crumble. Cole had a brief moment of uncertainty until Grimble gave him an impassioned speech of his responsibility as mayor. Cole led the Fable community to evacuate to The Farm so as to regroup and figure out what to do from there. In addition, he and Beauty have also taken over babysitting duties of Bigby and Snow's cubs while the parents were sent to investigate Jack Horner's claims regarding the Literals as well as Rose Red descending heavily into depression following Boy Blue's death. Mowgli Mowgli was from a Homeland similar to India. Being raised by wolves, he could speak their language, and had a vast knowledge of nature and animals. His training had also trained him in tracking people and combat. When the Adversary attacked, Mowgli fled to Fabletown along with his friends Bagheera and Baloo as well as his enemy Shere Khan. At some point, Mowgli became one of the Tourists, a person who was in charge of keeping track of Fables living outside of Fabletown. From that point on, he spent 20 years wandering the world between visits back to Fabletown. After the revolution on The Farm, Mowgli found out that Bagheera had been imprisoned for his involvement. To free his friend, Mowgli agreed to track down Bigby Wolf. Mowgli was able to track Bigby to where he was hiding in Alaska. When Bigby heard that he could be with his family, he agreed to come with Mowgli back to Fabletown. After tracking Bigby, Prince Charming kept his word and freed Bagheera. Hobbes Originally butler to Bluebeard, Hobbes the goblin stayed on to work for Prince Charming after the Prince slew his former master. Calm and dignified, Hobbes is nevertheless a formidable fighter and fought savagely during the Battle of Fabletown. Hobbes worked tirelessly in Charming's election campaign and has generally proved invaluable to his master. He possesses a glamour for use in public, presumably provided by his masters, and notes proudly that he maintains an unblemished record of reliability with it. His great expertise as manservant leads him to be apparently very well paid; when asked about it, Prince Charming dryly noted that Hobbes was better paid as a servant than he was as Mayor himself. The name Hobbes is an obvious a pun on the word Hobgoblin. He is the first to notice that the gold covering Mr. Dark is cracking. He is also the first to fall to the now freed Mr. Dark. Mr. Dark keeps Hobbe's skull, intending to eat the goblin's teeth later, in order to summon his spirit to serve him. However, Mr. Dark is killed by the North Wind before this happens. He is presumably named after the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes.Nevins, Jess, Willingham, Bill, Buckingham, Mark (2013). Fables Encyclopedia. New York. DC Comics. PinocchioBriar Rose Better known as Sleeping Beauty, Briar Rose was Prince Charming's second wife. She escaped from the Homelands with close to nothing, but a blessing received on her christening day, which promised that she'd always be wealthy, came to her rescue, and she rapidly gained great wealth through successful speculation on the stock market. As such, she lives in a luxurious apartment filled with expensive furniture and decoration. Her curse, however, remains in effect, with the slightest prick of her finger leading to her falling asleep, followed by everybody else in the building, which is then surrounded by rapidly growing thorn-bearing plants. A kiss from a (genuinely) loving \\"prince\\" resets the curse back to the start. It has been revealed during a talk with Bigby that in one incident when her finger was pricked, the police sent in a police dog named \\"Prince\\" and his innocent dog kiss awoke her, the affection of a dog being honest and true (though Briar threatened Bigby never to tell a soul of the incident). While generally a hazard, forcing Rose to take extreme care and wear gloves at all times, the curse has proved useful on at least two occasions. The first was in the story A Two-Part Caper when journalist Tommy Sharp threatened to reveal what he had discovered about the Fables, the curse was employed to put the inhabitants of his building to sleep while a team led by Bigby Wolf ransacked his apartment. However, when it came time to awaken her, Prince Charming's kiss did not work, most likely because he no longer loved her. Flycatcher's kiss woke her up, which ended up with her tasting flies when she awoke. Presumably the love has to be genuine but does not have to be romantic. It has never been revealed if she knew Flycatcher awoke her or not. The second occasion was during the war against the Empire, as depicted in the War and Pieces story-arc, when the curse was deployed within the Imperial capital, putting the inhabitants of the entire city to sleep, depriving the Empire of most of its senior officials and the majority of their combat-ready sorcerers. Recently, the city was burned to the ground, but not before Briar Rose and the Snow Queen were carried away, still asleep, by a mysterious cadre of goblins. It is implied in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love that Briar Rose and Cinderella share the same fairy godmother, but this was later proven apocryphal in the Fables spin-off Fairest. It is also implied, still in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love, that Frau Totenkinder may have been the one who cursed Briar with her sleep spell (also implied in the Fables story arc War and Pieces); even though Fairest shows that the one to actually put the curse on Briar Rose was the evil fairy Hadeon the Destroyer (which could indicate that Totenkinder was merely the spell's creator). It is unknown if Briar knew it was Totenkinder who cursed her. Another theory is that the sleeping girl next to Frau Totenkinder and a spinning wheel is only the miller's daughter (from \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\") - not Briar Rose (Frau Totenkinder might have just put into motion the \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\" events). In the Fairest story arc Wide Awake, a bottle imp tells Ali Baba, who is seeking treasures in the burned down city,about the sleeping girl that is blessed with eternal wealth and riches, but needs to be woken with true love's kiss from a prince. Ali Baba sneaks into the goblins' encampment, and kisses the sleeping Briar Rose, who awakens from the spell, along with the Snow Queen. The Snow Queen is seeking vengeance on Rose for putting her to sleep for years, and takes both of them captive. But instead of killing them, the Snow Queen forces Jonah, the bottle imp to tell her stories of Briar Rose's life, as the Snow Queen \\"is addicted to good stories\\", and Jonah is very good at telling stories. While Ali Baba and Briar are forced to spend time with Lumi, Ali Baba realizes that he has no feelings for Briar after all, but is in love with Lumi. It is revealed that because Ali Baba risked his life to wake and rescue Briar Rose, his actions fell under the definition of true, but not romantic, love. Briar also defeats Hadeon the Destroyer, the evil fairy from the fairy tale. Briar's fairy godmothers then turn Hadeon into a car that can travel to any world, and the spaces between worlds. The car has to serve one thousand times before it will revert to Hadeon. Briar uses the car to travel back to the newly re-built Fabletown, as seen in the Fables story arc Snow White. When the car has been used nine hundred and ninety-nine times, she plans to take it to the junkyard and have Hadeon destroyed once and for all by dropping it into a car crusher. In the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All the Land, Briar Rose was revealed to be having a secret relationship with the dryad Prince Aspen, something no one in Fabletown knew about. Unfortunately for her, a murderous Goldilocks did and murdered the two for apparently giving into \\"carnal\\" desires, burning them both together. Cinderella was able to resurrect her, but unfortunately she could only choose half of Goldilocks' victims; meaning she could not bring back Prince Aspen. Briar's ultimate fate is revealed in \\"Farewell\\": After a long and heroic life, Briar is about to succumb to a zombie's bite. She calls up Hadeon for her final ride, but to Hadeon's disappointment, she instructs her to drive \\"to the end of the universe,\\" pricks her finger, and falls asleep, content that not only will she not be awake to experience becoming a zombie, but her enemy will be unable to harm anyone again. Doctor Swineheart One of The Three Army Surgeons from the Grimm story of that name, Swineheart works at the Knights of Malta Hospital in New York, where the Special Research Section is in fact a cover for the private Fables-only medical facility. Swineheart took charge of Snow White's recovery after she was shot in the head by Goldilocks during the abortive rebellion at the Farm, and also dealt with her extensively during her pregnancy with Bigby's children. A battlefield surgeon without peer, his services proved invaluable during the battle of Fabletown. He appears to have taken on some mundane attitudes, most likely because he deals with mundane patients as well as his work with the Fables, to the extent that he starts to suggest the possibility of abortion when Snow expresses her unhappiness about the scandal her pregnancy has resulted in. The appalled Snow stops him going any further, threatening to throw him out of Fabletown if he persists. Oddly she insists that she must carry the pregnancy to term because of duty to society rather than to herself, although it is unclear why she thinks that society is improved by her children (possibly, it is because Max Piper had cast a curse on Fables, preventing them from bearing children - so the cubs were the first newborns in decades). Rapunzel Cursed by Frau Totenkinder (apparently for displeasing her by being a 'slutty little girl'), Rapunzel's hair is constantly growing, at a rate of four inches an hour, so she has to live under the most restrictive conditions of any of the city Fables, to prevent any mundanes from noticing the fast growth. She has three haircuts each day. She was part of the group of Fables who were part of the last stand in the old territory and she was also present at the Remembrance Day for those who died in the battle at the Last Castle. It is revealed in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love that Cinderella's Fairy Godmother showed Rapunzel's prince the way to the tower she was kept in, mainly to spite Frau Totenkinder. In Fairest it is revealed that Rapunzel knows of Frau and truly doesn't believe she's reformed and has a disdain for her. It is also revealed that in order to survive the winter, Rapunzel's mother sold her for a handful of gold to Totenkinder to be the witch's apprentice. Rapunzel and the prince had a passionate love affair which resulted in Rapunzel's pregnancy. When Totenkinder found out, she threw Rapunzel out. Oddly enough, despite the bad history Rapunzel does call Totenkinder \\"Mom\\", though it could be to get on Totenkinder's good side. After being thrown out by Totenkinder, Rapunzel tried to find her lost lover. Unbeknownst to her, Cinderella's fairy godmother forbade the prince to contact Rapunzel again, as the godmother had \\"plans for her\\". No one would take the homeless Rapunzel in, because of her past as Totenkinder's ward. As Rapunzel was giving birth to her children, a strange woman came to her aid. The woman drugged her, and stole the children, who were twin girls, away. Rapunzel spent centuries looking for her daughters across a hundred worlds. Eventually, she gave up trying to find the children, and sailed off the edge of the world in a ship, planning to die. Instead, she washed up on the shore of one of The Hidden Kingdom, a Fable Homeland populated by people and creatures of Japanese mythology and culture. There, she became a member of the Emperor's court, and had a lesbian romance with a female kitsune named Tomoko; this could mean that Rapunzel's bisexual. It is also revealed that Rapunzel is Okiku from the famous Japanese ghost story; while spending time at the Emperor's court, she took Okiku as her new name. The shogun had Rapunzel's lover banished, along with many other yokai. He confiscated the kitsune's foxfire - her soul, which she kept outside her body. The shogun kept the foxfire in a safe locked with a sliding puzzle. When Rapunzel tried to get the foxfire back for Tomoko, she discovered that she was unable to solve the puzzle slide, and broke a plate in anger. The shogun caught her trying to break her into the safe, and beat her up and threw her limp form down a well. Rapunzel was unable to climb out the well, and ate her hair in order to survive. She coughed up hundreds of bezoars, knots of her own hair forming in her gut. They talked to her with spiny mouths. Rapunzel knotted several of them into her hair, which gave her the purchase she needed to climb out. She escaped from the well, and killed the shogun and his men. Centuries later, in the mundy world, Rapunzel and Joel Crow venture with Jack Horner (before his break with Rose Red) to Japan, where the Japanese Fables have started a new life after the Adversary's invasion. Rapunzel gets caught in a war between Tomoko's group and the other Japanese Fables, but eventually manages to help her former lover and the other Japanese Fables find their way back to their homeland via a magical portal. Frau Totenkinder reveals to Joel Crow that she knows who took Rapunzel's children, and that this person is an enemy of Totenkinder, who would use Rapunzel to bring her and all of Fabletown down. This is why the twins were stolen, and why she can't tell Rapunzel. She persuades Joel to give Rapunzel a memory potion that will make her forget about her daughters, Tomoko and The Hidden Kingdom. It is implied that Joel gives the potion to Rapunzel. Kay Once a captive of the Snow Queen, Kay is now grown and living in New York, away from Fabletown itself. It has never been stated what happened to his friend Gerda or their home. He still has the troll mirror shards in his eye, with the result that he sees all the bad that people have ever done. The pain that this causes him leads him to routinely gouge out his own eyes, although they subsequently grow back over a period of around ten years. Kay has proven very useful in the past at detecting traitors, and it is with this in mind that Beast asked Frau Totenkinder to magically restore Kay's sight to assist him in rooting out Fables who might be secretly working for the Adversary. Because of his ability, Kay is the only other person in Fabletown to know the full details of Bigby's past deeds and how Frau Totenkinder truly gets her powers. Currently, he has been drained of life energy and turned into a witherling by Mister Dark. The \\"bad\\" he sees is defined so by Fabletown morals and not by Mundy justice, as he sees the \\"bad\\" in Bigby (though he was mostly doing what he did because of an understandable (from a wolves perspective) dislike of humans, and from hunger rather than for the sake of evil) and in Frau Totenkinder (though what she does is perfectly legal from a 21st-century Mundy American justice point of view). After seeing the evil in The Adversary, he was so overwhelmed he gouged his eyes out again. Soon afterward, he was killed by Mr. Dark, who devoured his teeth to make him a witherling. When Totenkinder destroyed Mister Dark's teeth by feeding him candy, most likely this ended Dark's control over Kay's body. \\"The Cubs\\" (From left to right) Winter, Conner, Therese, Darien, Ambrose, Blossom Snow and Bigby's seven children are a rowdy, unpredictable bunch of hybrids that seem to have inherited abilities from all facets of their heritage. All, but Ghost, can fly, at first uncontrollably so, flight having been their natural state; they needed to be taught how to ground themselves. They can transform into wolf form. One of the seven, later named Ghost by Bigby, is a zephyr, a rogue wind whose invisible nature meant his parents were initially unaware of his existence. This entity fed off the air of living beings, accidentally killing them before he learned control. Snow White, after a rash of deaths, discovers that they were inadvertently caused by her last child. She sends Ghost to find his self-exiled father. The family has since been reunited. On their fifth birthday, the other six cubs were introduced to Ghost, but were sworn to secrecy as to his existence, as zephyrs are considered dangerous aberrations, and their grandfather Mr. North is obligated by a prior vow to exterminate any zephyrs known to exist. Ghost appears sweet, if anything confused since he cannot feel normal things the others do. He's not hungry, thirsty or sleepy. But he is good at finding people, which was what convinced Snow to find Bigby. Ambrose, the chubby and sweet cub named after Flycatcher, is portrayed as the weak link, often too scared to transform or fly when in danger. Ambrose narrates certain events such as the family's trip to his grandfather's castle, as well as his narrow escape from his six wild uncles, with whom his father later fought. These are done in the form of memoirs. Darien is shown as the leader of the pack, something that Bigby has commented on. Another female cub, Winter (named after Bigby's mother), is portrayed as being shy and cuddly, often shown sucking her thumb or holding a stuffed animal, usually the only one of the cubs to do so. Her brother Darien has referred to Winter as the runt of the litter, despite her being the firstborn. She also stands out because, unlike her other siblings, she was the only one who was born completely human in appearance. The remaining cubs are Conner, who isn't too different from Darien in personality and possesses similar facial characteristics like Prince Charming;Therese, a blonde-headed cub who is observant, but tends to confuse things; and Blossom, who bears a great deal of resemblance to Rose Red, seems to have inherited some stereotypical \\"Fairytale Princess\\" qualities, and is often seen with cute cuddly forest creatures and butterflies following her around. During the Fables Fourm panel in the 2009 San Diego Comic Con, a one-page story was handed out to attendees that would foretell the fate of the cubs possibly within the next one hundred issues. Ambrose meets one of the Thirteenth Floor Witches, Ozma of Oz, the young childlike second in command to Frau Totenkinder, who at his behest tells him of a prophecy she had. She explains: * The first child will be a king. (Winter; see below) * The second child a pauper. (Blossom) * The third will do an evil thing. (Therese; see below) * The fourth will die to stop her. (Darien; see below) * The fifth will be a hero bold. (Connor) * The sixth will judge the rest. (Ambrose; see below) * The seventh lives to ages old, and is by heaven blessed (Ghost) The Witch further explains that her vision made no real detailed specifics as to which child is which and she leaves it up to Ambrose to decide if he should tell the others. When the Cubs approach their ninth birthday, and the first result of the prophecy is revealed. After the death of the North Wind, Bigby's father, a successor is chosen among his grandchildren. After a series of tests are performed, Winter is named the winner and the new king of the North Wind's kingdom. Winter will be sent away soon for her training, but she admits to her father that she's deathly afraid as a result of recently having nightmares of her older self as the North Wind. In her dreams, she is no longer her sweet and shy self and sees herself as a cold and selfish person that hurts people. If this will happen is not known. In the Camelot arc, it seems Winter's future may soon come. She reveals she has surpassed her training and due to her mantle as the North Wind, like Therese, she has already grown. She takes her adult appearance when she kicks out the other cardinal winds from her palace, but reverts to her child form as she believes a battle will happen between her mother and Aunt Rose. In order to protect her mother, she plans to gather a few small allies, among them Santa and the Snow Queen herself. Therese receives a red plastic tugboat (Mr. Steampuddle) as a Christmas gift from an unknown admirer. The mysterious boat starts talking to Therese and convinces her to find some water for it. Therese, acting as if she is under some kind of spell, finds a stream, where she puts the boat in the water; the boat grows in size, convinces Therese to board it. The boat takes Therese to Toyland, a bleak, mysterious land inhabited by discarded toys, where she is thrilled to be crowned the Queen of Toyland. She is quickly dismayed to learn she cannot fly in Toyland, nor can she go home. Therese begins to starve because nothing grows in Toyland and that all of Toyland's inhabitants are toys that caused their child owners to be killed in accidents involving the toys (i.e. choking on a toy, a toy catching fire, etc.). The toys have also brought many other children to Toyland before Therese, and all of them starved to death before they had a chance to restore the toys. Back in the \\"mundy\\" world, Darien realizes that as the pack leader, it is his job to look after the rest of the cubs. With the help of Lord Mountbatten, a magical clockwork tiger capable of taking physical form, he travels to Toyland to rescue his sister. But her army of toys attack them and injure Darien, and take Mountbatten prisoner. Mountbatten is brought before Therese. Whether due to her diminishing condition or the dark influence of the land, Therese coldly orders the toys to kill him (even after he explained he came to save her) and savagely ate at his raw flesh, then ordered the toys to cook the rest, even using the wooden toys to cook her meal. Darien realizes that in order to save his sister, he must sacrifice himself, and impales himself on a broken mini pool cue. His blood goes into a magical cauldron and his body goes into the soil. Because of Darien's magical bloodline, his blood invokes an ancient magic. The grass begins to grow in Toyland, and the cauldron is restored and becomes filled up with food every day, always magically fresh and hot. Therese grieves over her brother for a long, long time, until a now older and more mature Therese decides it is time to put her brother's sacrifice to work and begin the restoration of her kingdom. Because everyone there, including herself, is a killer, they will have to earn their forgiveness, and save one hundred lives for each life they took. Therese commands Mr. Steampuddle to set out on a series of new voyages across the waves: the toys are to save lives instead of taking them. Over the years, the toys save many children from various accidents. Mr. Steampuddle and the toys go back and forth many times, returning often over the years to report their successes to the queen before being sent out again. Gradually, Toyland and its inhabitants are restored and made whole again. In time, when most of the toys have been restored, and thousands of children lives have been saved, Therese returns to the mundy world, and discovers that little time has passed there: her siblings are still children, while she herself is now an adult. She tells her family about Darien's sacrifice. The story arc strongly implies that Therese is the third child from the prophecy, the one who would do an evil thing, and Darien is the one who dies to stop her, although it could also be argued that his actions cast him in the role of a hero bold. By the nature of Ambrose's narration, it appears he does not become a pauper and that in a sense he is judging the others in hindsight (though, to some, it appears he is only providing guidance to Dare - not judging him). Such interpretations have yet to be definitively proven out. In the Fables story The Destiny Game, an adult Ambrose appears to be in a well-established relationship with the Lady of the Lake. In that story, it is also revealed that, no matter their nigh-immortality (due to their nature as Fables and part-gods), they will all die, eventually (as Bigby is fated to outlive them all). Still according to Bigby's new fate, all of his cubs will lay waste to worlds (meaning they will all do terrible things, eventually - though this is contradicted by Dare's noble suicide before he had any opportunity to commit any crime of any kind at all). However, as noted earlier, the Lady can reassign fates. In the Fables story Snow White, the adult Ambrose narrates the events that led to Bigby's death, and reveals he is the child who judges the rest as the witch foretold, by telling the histories. The ultimate fates of other siblings are given in \\"Farewell\\": Winter remains a king. Blossom, though technically a vagabond, is the protector of an entire world. Connor becomes a hero. Ambrose becomes a historian. Ghost, having learned to occupy artificial bodies, outlives all of his siblings. Many of them have descendants, some of whom are present at the large family reunion that closes the series. Other New York Fables *The Forsworn Knight: A human figure in full medieval armor, the Knight hangs from a noose tied to the tree in the Fabletown business office in the early issues of Fables. All that was known about him was that he had apparently killed himself sometime in the 13th century and that, when plied with alcohol, he's prone to singing and uttering prophecies; it is mentioned that things got decidedly messy the last time that this happened. In The Good Prince story arc, it is revealed that the Forsworn Knight is the ghost of Lancelot, who has pledged his service to Flycatcher, as well as knighted Ambrose to become the Once and Future King. *Cock Robin: Was killed by another bird fable during the Farm revolt. Cock Robin's death in the mundane world was final, in spite of reader confusion which suggests that he came back at the end of the 'Animal Farm' story-arc. Mark Buckingham has pointed out that the second robin that appeared later on in that arc was a different robin, and not Cock Robin himself. However, it is unclear if Cock Robin was one of the bird spirits that joined Flycatcher's kingdom the story- arc 'The Good Prince' (as several of the fables killed in revolt at the Farm were shown to, their bodies presumably having been committed to the witching well for disposal.). His appearance in the series is quite controversial, since he only appeared in one nursery rhyme Who Killed Cock Robin ... a story in which we learn he had already been killed even before the very start of the nursery rhyme. *Jack Ketch: The executioner who killed Dun and Posey Pig after the revolution at the Farm. He is named after the infamous executioner. According to Bill Willingham, Jack Ketch in Fables is an office, and not a single person. *Edmond Dant√®s: Better known by his famous alias of 'The Count of Monte Cristo', Edmond owns and runs Fabletown's Chateau d'If Fencing Academy. He can often be found in the Branstock Tavern. He is killed by Goldilocks in the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All the Land, during a fencing lesson with Snow White, who was Goldilocks' intended victim. Although Snow is resurrected by Cinderella, Dant√®s is not, as Cindy can only bring half of Goldilock's victims bring back to life. *Crow brothers: Joel, Vulco, and Ephram Crow are the three survivors of the original twelve brothers. The brothers, warriors all, fought fiercely against the Adversary's forces and the Crows were instrumental in ensuring the escape of the last ship to leave the Homelands, as the then-surviving seven, armed only with daggers, took on and defeated a pair of dragons who were threatening the fleeing vessel, at the cost of four of their number. These days, Joel's sole task is to cut Rapunzel's hair three times a day, Ephram works as a security guard at the Knights of Malta hospital and Vulco runs the I Am the Eggman diner. The three Crows were brought in to assist with the arrest of the visiting Arabian Fables. Vulco is known to date Clara, the former dragon turned bird, in his bird form; as well as a fair maiden named Katrinelje while he is in human form. *The Magical Mirror: Served as an adviser to Bufkin while the latter was stranded in the business office. Other people who have asked the mirror questions are Flycatcher, Prince Charming and Jack Horner. In the Witches story arc, the mirror is also identified as the mirror from the tale of The Snow Queen. *Thrushbeard: Still as hirsute as his name suggests, Thrushbeard apparently managed to escape the Homelands with some of his royal fortune, as observed by Jack when he tried to sell the exiled King the magic beans; Thrushbeard, wise to Jack's ways, wanted nothing to do with it. He can often be found drinking in the Branstock Tavern. Whether his wife escaped the Homelands with him is unknown. *The Boy Who Cried Wolf: Referred to in the March of the Wooden Soldiers story arc. When Snow White does not believe Jack Horner's story about The Wooden Soldiers, Snow asks if he did ever hear about the Boy Who Cried Wolf; Jack replies: \\"Sure Snow. He lives up on the second floor\\" (of the Woodlands building). *Little Miss Muffet and the spider: Now apparently married to the spider and calling herself Mrs. Web, she is Fabletown's biggest gossip. Her husband, the Spider, was one of the victims of Snow's son Ghost. He was later among the ghosts who went with Flycatcher to Haven. *Frankenstein's monster: Was animated by Nazis during World War II. Bigby fought the monster (in a reference to the 1943 film Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man) when he and a squad of Allied soldiers stormed the castle where the experiment was being performed. The Monster's still-animated head is kept in the business office in the Woodlands building where Bigby chats with him from time to time. He often has phantom thirst and is given drinks by Bufkin though the last time this happened, the bottom of his cage rusted out. He is Bufkin's dear friend and ally, he teams up with Bufkin and the others when they discover they're stuck with Baba Yaga. In the March of the Wooden Soldiers story arc, Pinocchio can be seen reading the Frankenstein novel, establishing its existence in the Mundane world of the series; it has yet to be clarified whether the Monster is a true Fable (i.e., a migrant from a Homeland where the events of the novel occurred) or a rare case of a non-Fable paranormal native to the Mundane. *The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs: Believed killed in the Adversary's assault on the Homelands, Gudrun actually escaped and now lives in a secret den within the Woodlands building. Her eggs provided Bigby with an untraceable source of funds for his covert activities. With Bigby moved on, Gudrun now fulfills the same role for his replacement, Beast. *Shylock: In The Mean Seasons, Bigby talks about a man who converts the Goose's eggs into currency. Bill Willingham has identified the person as Shylock, the central character from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. It seems that Shylock still works with money in some unspecified manner. *Jack Sprat: Killed off-screen by Ghost during The Mean Seasons story arc. He is also mentioned in the Jack of Fables story Jack O' Lantern. *Barbara Allen: Referred to in the story arcs The Mean Seasons and Rose Red. The character of a folksong. She was accidentally killed by Ghost. *Hakim: A newly freed Arabian slave, he has had trouble adjusting to modern-day New York. He became the bodyguard to Briar Rose when she agreed to use her curse to disable the Empire's capital city. Years later, he was still asleep together with Mrs. Someone, who acted as Briar Rose's magical guardian. Recently, the sleeping Briar Rose was carried out of the city by goblins, before the city was burned to the ground, and it is assumed that Mrs. Someone and Hakim were killed in the fire. *The Butcher, the Baker and the Candlestick-Maker: Appear in Happily Ever After and The Great Fables Crossover. Jack Horner, having met the revised version of the trio at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village, claims that they are spies of Mr. Revise and not the real ones. When he orders the other Fables to arrest them, the Baker runs for his life.Fables 84: The Great Fables Crossover, part 4 of 9 *Bean Nighe: She was first referred to in a map of Fabletown, printed in the Wolves trade paperback, which says that Ford Laundry is run by \\"the washer woman at the Ford\\". She makes her first appearance in the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All the Land, which reveals that Bean Nighe has the ability to predict the deaths of other people. In this story, Bean Nighe, along with Morgan le Fay, were victims at the hands of Goldilocks. Cinderella is able to bring back the victims of Goldilocks, but she's only allowed to choose half, and chooses Morgan Le Fay, seeing her more valuable an alley for Fabletown. *Fair Katrinelje: Referred to in Burning Questions. She is dating Vulco Crow when he's human. *S.O.S.: The Society of Seconds, a faction composed of Fables who were born in the Mundy world, most likely from before the Pied Piper's Curse. They want to go back, and establish a country in one of the now liberated Homelands. *Seamus McGuire, a member of Boy Blue's band who plays the harp. He is referred to in Peter and Max: A Fables Novel, and can be seen with the band in the Fables story \\"All in a Single Night\\". He has his first speaking role in The Boys in the Band story arc. *Baby Joe Sheppard, a member of Boy Blue's band who plays the drums. He is referred to in Peter and Max: A Fables Novel, and can be seen with members of the band in the Fables stories Single Combat and \\"All in a Single Night\\". He has his first speaking role in The Boys in the Band story arc. *Crispin Cordwainer: The famous shoemaker of The Elves and the Shoemaker, named for St. Crispin, the patron of cobblers. He runs the Glass Slipper while Cinderella is off doing her spy work. The elves still have a working relationship with him, though their magic gifts come with unexpected side effects. This is seen when Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love while Cindy goes on another mission (though she told him it was a business trip) he decides to run the shop his way. He convinces the elves to make magic shoes for the Fabletown women, such as jogging shoes that jog for you. However, despite their warning, he gets what he wants. And it comes with a side effect, as the women (like Rapunzel who bought jogging shoes) can't take the shoes off and it is exhausting them. This causes the angry women to organize a protest where mundys can see, which puts Crispin in trouble with Sheriff Beast. Eventually when Cindy returns, she makes the elves take back the shoes (though Cindy must pay them for their efforts, but she takes it out of Crispin's paycheck). She also makes Crispin give all the Fabletown women long foot massages for their tired feet. The elves decide to send their shoes back to the Homelands for the soldiers that served the \\"Emperor\\". *The Huntsman: From the Snow White fairytale. He first appears in flashbacks during the Rose Red and Camelot story arcs, playing the same role as he does in the fairy tale. In the Fairest story arc Of Men and Mice, it is established that he is a resident of Fabletown. It is implied that he and Crispin are lovers; when Crispin is in a coma after a bomb attack meant for Cinderella, the huntsman remains at Crispin's bedside for days.

While the Fairy Witch's great task was the creation of Fabletown and the Woodland building and Totenkinder's great task was the battle against the Empire, Ozma sees her task as the battle against Mr. Dark for the sake of Fabletown. Was voted the new leader of the 13th floor after Frau Totenkinder went to find Dunster Happ. She participated in a power struggle in The Farm along with Stinky and Gepetto, and in the end was named one of Rose Red's three advisers. With Totenkinder gone to live with her new husband, Ozma is the leader of the thirteenth floor witches. Great Fairy Witch The former leader of the 13th floor who has gone a little crazy. She is the witch from Thumbelina, as seen in flashbacks in the Fables story The Barleycorn Brides. It is hinted that Frau Totenkinder was the one who caused her to go mad after she took over the Fairy Witch's role - besides, when Totenkinder gave her knitting needles and her bag of wool balls their true forms and names back and stopped knitting, the Great Fairy Witch continued to knit with no needles and no wool. She has gone by other names including Ardelia, Cherish, Birdie and Bulah. Maddy A black cat with a demon-like, pointed tail who has appeared in a few panels with Frau Totenkinder and other witches. She is the acknowledged specialist in matters of locating and hiding and is a shape-shifter. Her powers at hiding are so great that Mr. Dark couldn't detect her, when she went to spy on him, although she had trouble keeping away from his detection, calling Mr Dark the most paranoid and dangerous of any subject she had spied on before. Ozma used her to find Frau Totenkinder before she went into seclusion. The character has been revealed to represent both Sycorax from The Tempest and Medea from Greek mythology. Maddy seems to be second in command to Ozma, the same way that Ozma herself was always second to Totenkinder. Mr. Grandours Mr. Grandours (in French, literally \\"large bear\\") is the title character from the French fairy tale The Wizard King (from Andrew Lang's The Yellow Fairy Book), about a shapeshifting wizard king; this is revealed in the Fables Encyclopedia.Nevins, Jess, Willingham, Bill, Buckingham, Mark (2013). Fables Encyclopedia. New York. DC Comics. The local Imperial Governor instructed Mr. Grandours to guard a tower, filled with various treasures, including the magic barleycorns. He helped John Barleycorn and Arrow retrieve the jar and joined Fabletown. He eventually returned to his human form and lives on the 13th floor. He's the man in a big fur coat and hat with bear eyes. He was the one that originally revived Boy Blue and Bigby Wolf when they were almost killed by a magic arrow. Mrs. Someone A witch who stayed with Briar Rose and Hakim during the takeover of Calabri Anagni, the Imperial capital of the Fable Homelands. Her true name is still unknown as she keeps it a secret \\"tucked away where no fell power can discern it.\\" Mrs. Someone and Hakim chose to stay with Briar Rose until the end and fell under Briar's sleeping spell. Recently, the sleeping Briar Rose was carried out of the city by goblins, before the city was burned to the ground, and it is assumed that Mrs. Someone and Hakim were killed in the fire. Prospero Protagonist of William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Prospero is seen agreeing with Mr. Grandours that haste is a \\"mundy quality\\". It is unknown how the relation between Prospero and Maddy is, as he used her son as a slave for years. However, this would fall under the Fabletown Compact which pardons any crimes done before signing. Mr. Kadabra Depicted as a stereotypical Stage Magician wearing a top hat. In earlier appearances, he is seen wearing a button with \\"yog\\" on it which refers to meditation and concentration. His name derives from the magic phrase abracadabra. He has recently been killed by an unknown assailant in the first issue of Cinderella: Fables Are Forever. In the Fables story In Those Days, it is revealed that Mr. Kadabra's real name is Karrant. Karrant was a powerful sorcerer who cast a spell on the Adversary that made the Adversary ignore any land in which Kadabra dwelled. The cost of Karrant's actions was that he forgot all about the spell and his enemy. He wandered from world to world until he ended up in Fabletown in the mundane world, where he made a living as a stage magician, adopting the stage name \\"Master Kadabra\\". He was eventually killed by Dorothy Gale, who needed a dead body to send a message to her archenemy, Cinderella. GeppettoMorgan le Fay Morgan le Fay, from the saga of King Arthur, is the witch with the long dark hair and beauty mark on her face. Her identity was first revealed in the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All the Land, and later in Fables 136 (Camelot, Part 6). She is also known as Mrs. Green, as revealed in Fables 128 (Snow White, Chapter Four). Morgan was part of Ozma's super team put together to defeat Mister Dark, where she was given the \\"superhero name\\" The Green Witch. She has the power to fly. In the Snow White story arc, after the story arc's title character is taken captive by Prince Brandish, Morgan is seen discussing rescue plans with her fellow witches, Ozma and Maddy. Because Brandish has bewitched himself so that any injury inflicted on him will also hurt Snow, the task is easier said than done, especially since the spell is difficult to break. Morgan comes up with a plan. They will not try to break the spell, but add to it instead: She will build in a delay between cause and effect, which will give them some wiggle room between the moment Brandish is killed, and when the same thing happens to Snow. Morgan begins the hard work of casting the spell, while Rose Red rescues Snow while Brandish is distracted. Snow then engages Brandish in a sword fight, while Morgan slowly, but carefully manages to unwind the spell that Brandish has cast on himself, allowing Snow stab him straight through his heart. Unfortunately, the spell is not broken, merely delayed. In the Camelot story arc, Morgan breaks the bad news to Snow: Sooner or later, the fatal wound is bound to be inflicted on Snow herself, which will kill her. In Fairest In All the Land, Morgan, along with Bean Nighe, a Fabled oracle, were victims at the hands of Goldilocks. While Cinderella is able to bring back the victims of Goldilocks; she's only allowed to choose half. She ultimately chooses Morgan Le Fay, seeing her more valuable an ally for Fabletown. Snow White's fate is resolved in the same story; she is stabbed through the heart (as Morgan predicted) by Goldilocks. Fortunately, Cinderella is able to bring her back to life.

The stele was published in 1897 but is now lost.Karl Richard Lepsius: Denkmaler Abtheilung II Band IV Available online see p. 152; Lepsius: Denkmaler, Text, I (1897) 15 In addition, the prenomen of a king who could be Nerikare is attested on a Nile record from Semna, near the second cataract of the Nile in Nubia. The record is dated to the first regnal year of this king, whose name was read as \\"Djefakare\\" by egyptologists F. Hintze and W. F. Reineke.F. Hintze and W. F. Reineke: Felsinschriften aus dem sudanesischen Nubien, Publikation der Nubien-Expedition, 1961‚Äì1963 I; Berlin 1989 Kim Ryholt however notes that the prenomen was misread by the discoverers of the record with Gardiner's sign G14 nry, representing a vulture, mistaken for the sign G42 representing a duck and reading ·∏èf3. Thus, Ryholt and others, such as Darrell Baker, now reads the name as \\"Nerikare\\".  Chronological position  Ryholt points out that known Nile records, which are similar to the one he attributes to Nerikare, all date to the time period from the late 12th to early 13th dynasties. He thus concludes that Nerikare too must have been a king of this time period, and since \\"Nerikare\\" does not appear on the Turin canon, Ryholt proposes that he was mentioned in the wsf lacuna affecting the third king of the dynasty in the Turin canon (column 7, line 6). A wsf (literally \\"missing\\") lacuna signals a lacuna in the document from which the Turin canon was copied in Ramesside times. This would establish Nerikare as the third king of the dynasty, although the lacuna might have comprised two kings and Nerikare could possibly be the fourth ruler, following an unknown king. The duration of Nerikare's reign is reported as exactly 6 years on the Turin canon, however Ryholt has shown that this is true for all kings marked as wsf and that this figure was likely inserted by the author of the king list in order to avoid chronological gaps. Instead, Ryholt proposes that Nerikare reigned for only 1 year. Furthermore, the existence of a Nile record dated to his first regnal year indicates that he accessed the throne at the beginning of a calendar year, before the season of inundation during which such records were inscribed.See Ryholt, p. 321  Nomen  In his 1997 study of the second intermediate period, Kim Ryholt proposes that Nerikare's nomen may have been \\"Sobek\\". This nomen appears on three seals, which can be dated to the 13th dynasty, before Sobekhotep III. Since the nomina of all but two kings of this period are known, he argues that only Nerikare or Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw might have borne this nomen.See Ryholt, note 89 p.34  References  Category:18th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt ","title":"Nerikare"},{"id":"41621636","text":"Simplex is an automobile manufacturer that existed briefly, in France, between 1919 and 1921.

The Adversary Albeit a character that's rarely seen, the Adversary's actions are responsible for the entire premise of the comic book, in that the real Adversary masterminded the conquest of the Fable homelands, and centuries ago forced the Fables to flee into the mundane world. During the Boy Blue's encounter with the heavily armoured and massively imposing figure Adversary, he is shown to be a figurehead and literal puppet, with this fact and the true identity of the Empire's ruler unknown to even most of the Empire's top leaders. The Adversary is eventually revealed to be Geppetto. He was the primary antagonist for a long time in the series, but later on, his role is replaced by Mister Dark. Willingham originally intended for the Adversary to be revealed as Peter Pan. The term \\"The Adversary\\" appears based on \\"The Enemy,\\" the common term for Sauron in the Lord of the Rings. Interview with Bill Willingham Peter Pan did eventually make an appearance in 1001 Nights of Snowfall. https://fbcdn- photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak- prn1/s720x720/537084_831977663135_992932967_n.jpg?dl=1 It has also been theorized that the title \\"The Adversary\\" could be derived from Jewish and Christian literature where the name \\"Satan\\" actually comes from the Hebrew word for \\"Adversary.\\" Goldilocks The girl who broke into the Three Bears' home and ate their porridge has grown up. Now Goldilocks is a gun-toting Leftist political agitator. She leads about half of the Farm against Snow White in an attempted revolution. Despite her claims to be fighting for the 'rights' of the Farm Fables, and even becoming Little Bear's lover, her actions make it quite clear that she does not care about the cause, but rather the power that such a position would provide. After the revolution fails, Goldilocks flees to Fabletown, and hides out with her lover Bluebeard. The two scheme to remove Snow White and Bigby from power by use of a magic potion. Goldilocks is severely injured while attempting to assassinate Bigby and Snow White (being, in order, hit in the head with an axe, knocked off a cliff and then hit by a truck off another cliff into a river). Her popularity as a Fable allows her to regenerate from her injuries and she eventually reappears in the spin-off series Jack of Fables as a prisoner of Mr. Revise. During this time, she once again leads a revolution; this time, she leads her revolutionaries to believe Bookburner and his army is coming to save them from their captivity at Golden Boughs. Ironically, it is Bookburner's army that shoots the revolutionaries when they finally arrive. Goldilocks either survives or comes back to life, and reappears in Fairest. In Fairest In All the Land, it is revealed that Goldilocks may have a taste for, as Reynard puts it, \\"forbidden fruit\\", as she attempts to seduce Brock Blueheart (the Animal Farm story arc had previously revealed that she had a sexual relationship with Boo Bear). It also reveals that she is more psychotic than Fabletown knew. In this story, Cinderella investigates the murders of powerful women (i.e. Snow White, Rose Red, Frau Totenkinder, Beauty, and even Briar Rose). With help from Bo Peep, she discovers it is Goldilocks behind the murders. Goldielocks provides various reasons for the murders: some she had an obvious vendetta against, like Snow; other murders, she justified by finding them \\"tainted\\" in a way. Ultimately, Goldilocks meets in a final showdown with Bo Peep and Cinderella, with Bo losing her life. Goldielocks is killed off for good, and Cinderella is able to bring Bo back to life. Goldilocks is adept at tracking enemies in the wilderness, and is extremely skilled with a rifle, easily incapacitating Bigby in his giant wolf form when ambushed from behind. Contrary to her innocent- looking appearance, she has very keen senses, and is shown to be quite reckless and determined when she intends to kill someone. Cinderella later tells Snow White that Goldilocks had to die because she would have continued murdering like a ravenous animal. Bluebeard The former nobleman and serial killer who has reformed, or rather pretended he had, Bluebeard was involved with various shady dealings in Fabletown. He was enormously wealthy, nearly singlehandedly supporting the Fabletown government (which had no way to levy taxes, and thus relied on donations from wealthy patrons) and was able to afford even the top magical spells (his entire palace was hidden inside a room of his apartment). He considered himself to be the nemesis of Bigby Wolf, using every opportunity to try to put the Sheriff down. When he pointed out to Wolf that his threats lost their value if Bigby didn't follow them through, Bigby responded that he never needed to because Bluebeard, a terror against weaker and/or helpless opponents, always backed down when faced with a stronger one. This observation caused Bluebeard to shed tears, and to hate Bigby even more and he attempted to engineer his assassination and that of Snow White, working in conjunction with Goldilocks. Bluebeard was killed by Prince Charming who, out of some guilt over his own mistreatment of Snow White, sought to prevent Bluebeard from ordering that assassination attempt on Snow and Bigby. However, it had already been put into motion. As well, Charming wanted to seize his vast assets. Contrary to what his name might suggest, he is not, nor ever was, a pirate (though Willingham identified that Bluebeard's character design was supposed to be that of Captain Hook, absent from Fables because of copyright). His body was dropped down the witching well. Bluebeard appears along with other deceased Fables, Bluebeard says that he has learned to be virtuous, though Lancelot and Fly believe that his position of villain has not changed. After being caught conspiring with Shere Khan to kill Flycatcher, his flesh form was taken away. He aided the Adversary's troops in attacking Fly's new stronghold, as Fly anticipated. Afterwards, he stayed with the Adversary, whose magicians are attempting to make him once more corporeal. With the fall of the Empire in the War and Pieces story-arc, his current situation is unknown. Ichabod Crane Ichabod Crane's main appearance is in Cinderella Libertine, where it is revealed that Fabletown's former Deputy Mayor lost his job after he sexually harassed Snow White and embezzled government funds. He spent his years hiding through Europe, then recently France, which was where Fabletown's spy, Cinderella, found him. Cindy tricked Ichabod into believing her to be a spy for the Adversary and coming to Paris with her. Using her wits and feminine charm, she exposed him as a traitor willing to turn to the Adversary for revenge on the Fables. She even seduced him into signing a full confession. Bigby then executed Crane by bashing him in the head with a headless statue of Napoleon Bonaparte. Flashbacks from Crane's time as Deputy Mayor appear in the story Barleycorn Brides, the story arc Sons of Empire, the Jack of Fables story arc 1883, and Peter & Max: A Fables Novel, with the character also playing a role in the events of The Wolf Among Us which takes place during his last days as Deputy Mayor showing how he lost his position and his exile from Fabletown. Baba Yaga One of the Adversary's most powerful sorceresses, Baba Yaga arrived in Fabletown after taking the form of Red Riding Hood. In this disguise, she seduced, interrogated and tortured Boy Blue, and then led an army of wooden soldiers to attack Fabletown. She was defeated in a magical battle with Frau Totenkinder on the roof of the main Fabletown building where Totenkinder had spent years laying down protective spells, giving her the advantage. The rest of Fabletown believes Baba Yaga died in this battle; however, Bigby and Totenkinder kept her alive and restrained, regularly drained of magical power, in a secret prison cell in order to extract information from her. Her legendary chicken-legged hut was sent to the mundane world during the battle between Baba Yaga and the Boxers, an elite team of sorcerers whose mission is to seal away \\"Great old powers\\". To detain the witch, they had to remove her hut, as it protected her from the Boxers' lures. A conjured Field Gate was set up to send the hut to a random world, which turned out to be the mundane world, leaving Baba Yaga behind. Without the hut's protection, she was quickly captured. After fifty years of being \\"boxed away\\" she struck a deal with the Empire to serve it instead of being trapped forever. The hut was stored at the Farm, kept under tight magical control. It awoke during the Baba Yaga's mission, broke through the controlling spells and went on a rampage when Baba Yaga came through in disguise, providing Frau Totenkinder with a clue to her true identity. It was shown tied down on the Farm shortly after Baba Yaga's escape. Baba Yaga is served by the three demigod knights of the Rus, Bright Day, Radiant Sun and Dark Night, who rank among the most formidable warriors in the Empire. All three faced and were defeated by Boy Blue during his return to the Homelands, but due to their irrevocable bond with Baba Yaga, none of the three were able to die. Bright Day represented his mistress at the Imperial conference, appearing only as a head. Later, after Mr. Dark was released and unbound the various enchantments that had drawn on his power, including those holding her, Baba Yaga escaped from her cell, only to find herself trapped in the labyrinth rubble. She summons her knights, fully reformed, and plans her escape. However, before she can flee, she is defeated and killed, by the unlikely Bufkin who had been trapped within the Woodland office as well. The Wooden Soldiers The Empire's main military force consist of Geppetto's living wooden children. Although Geppetto maintains a large number of human troops, the wooden soldiers do the most difficult work, including the invasion of foreign lands, due to their extreme resiliency. Early on in the development of the Empire, they were used to take over kingdoms through trickery, by killing a king and replacing him with a wooden look-alike. Pinocchio was the first one Geppetto created; however, since then his creations have altered significantly. In addition to being created as adults rather than children, in both genders, they are brought to life with spells compelling them to obey Geppetto (these spells are obtained from Geppetto's main power source, the comatose body of the Blue Fairy). Aside from the Emperor, most wooden soldiers are highly derisive of all non-wooden life forms, human, Fable or otherwise, referring to them contemptuously as \\"meat\\" and commenting at great lengths about what they see as the many failures of human anatomy (the need for food and sleep and a relatively low resistance to injury). Sometimes they will even assault and murder \\"meat\\" without provocation, as seen as when Hugh, Drew, and Lou (the first three soldiers to infiltrate Fabletown) murdered a gun salesman. In contrast, they are very close to each other, addressing themselves as \\"Brother\\" and \\"Sister\\"; they also look \\"up\\" to Pinocchio, whom they see as their oldest sibling, since he was the first of their kind (despite the fact that he has since become human). A force of them were sent to Fabletown in March of the Wooden Soldiers; they were defeated in the bloody Battle of Fabletown. Although they were sent ostensibly to collect every single magical item that was taken out of the Homelands and return it to the Empire, they also came with the clear intent to kill as many of the Fables as they could, something that they seemed to take pleasure in anticipating. These soldiers are all identical, with hands and heads enchanted to look human, allowing them to more easily pass through the mundane world without suspicion. These soldiers all appear in matching suits, sunglasses and toupees (one observing mundane assumed they were a procession of Young Republicans). Generally, they are only distinguishable from each other by wig color. Three of the soldiers, Hugh, Drew and Louis are apparently the leaders; they are the first to appear in New York (with Baba Yaga), and are the first to visit Fabletown, warning that they will return to confiscate all magic items. They also steal guns (from the murdered gun salesman) to use in the battle, and oversee the construction and arming of their brothers. When every wooden soldier is assembled into an army of hundreds, they invade Fabletown en masse. Eventually, due to the leadership of Snow White and the nick-of-time appearance by Bigby Wolf, the soldiers are defeated, but not before killing many Fables. The soldiers afterwards are incarcerated as severed heads, and interrogated by Bigby Wolf and Cinderella; each individual soldier, when separated from his brothers, starts talking relatively quickly. Their bodies were thrown down the Witching Well. In The Good Prince a large host of them marched on Flycatcher's kingdom of Haven. After surrendering to them, Fly used his magic to revert them into the Sacred Grove they were carved from. Not only did this supply Haven with its own defensive barrier, it also deprived Geppetto of his resources, as only one Sacred Grove can exist at a time. In \\"Witches\\", the captured and beheaded Wooden Soldiers at least partially overcome the xenophobia they nurture for every flesh being (other than Geppetto and Pinocchio) and assist Bufkin in his quest for survival, because of the kindness he had shown them. The Snow Queen A sorceress of great power, Lumi (Finnish for \\"snow\\"Nevins, Jess, Willingham, Bill, Buckingham, Mark (2013). Fables Encyclopedia. New York. DC Comics. ), better known as the Snow Queen, is the commander of the Emperor's personal guard. According to Jack Horner, she is one of four sisters, each representing one of the seasons, who jointly ruled four kingdoms with each moving in a yearly cycle to bring the seasons in a predictable manner to their subjects. She was once naive and good-natured, with a childlike and somewhat gullible personality. That changed after Lumi had a relationship with Jack. Feeling unwell as the seasonal change approached, she naively gave her powers to Jack, creating the persona of Jack Frost, trusting him to arrange the transfer of the winter season to the next kingdom in the cycle. Jack immediately ignored her wishes, heading off to seek out new women to seduce and generally misuse the abilities given to him, abandoning Lumi, who quickly came to realise that she was not, in fact, unwell, but was instead pregnant with Jack's child. Jack's misadventures quickly wrecked the flow of the seasons, turning the population against her. Eventually, Lumi's three sisters were able to persuade Jack to return the powers that he'd taken. Angered by his betrayal, Lumi grew as cold as the season she controlled. While Jack is a compulsive liar, casting doubt on some of the details, Lumi took offence at a mention of \\"Jack Frost\\" during the War and Pieces story-arc, suggesting that at least some of this backstory is accurate. She was present when Boy Blue cut off the head of the Emperor during the Homelands story-arc and even detected his presence before he revealed himself, but was unable to determine who he was masquerading as and thus prevent his attack. When Blue escaped from captivity, Geppetto swore to send the Snow Queen after him to get revenge. In the Sons of Empire story, she acted as host of the Imperial conference called after Bigby's destruction of the magic grove. At the conference, she set out a four-stage plan for the invasion and destruction of the mundane world, which was generally approved, although she was instructed to make alterations after Pinocchio gave details of the likely response to such an assault. At the climax of the war between Fabletown and the Empire, as shown in War and Pieces, Lumi was present in the Imperial capital when Briar Rose, the legendary Sleeping Beauty, intentionally activated her curse within the city. Lumi immediately fell asleep with the rest of the population. When she fell into slumber, her powers were transmitted to her son, the new Jack Frost. However, he returned them to her shortly afterward, but apparently this was not sufficient to wake her up. Recently, the city was burned to the ground, but not before both Lumi and Sleeping Beauty were carried away, still asleep, by a mysterious cadre of goblins. Lumi eventually awakens when Ali Baba kisses Briar Rose, as seen in the comic Fairest. After killing and torturing all the goblins, who \\"dared to put their warty hands on her and dump her in a cart, like a bag of thrash\\", the Snow Queen, seeking vengeance on Briar Rose for putting her to sleep for years, sends her ice giants after Briar Rose, Noah and Ali Baba. Eventually, both are captured and taken to the Snow Queen. Instead of killing them, she asks the imp Noah to tell her the story of Briar Rose, as Lumi \\"is addicted to good stories\\". It is revealed that Lumi's actions while serving Geppetto were a result of Geppetto giving her his loyalty potions (the same ones he used to bind Pinocchio and all the other wooden soldiers to him) that made her utterly loyal to him. After being asleep for years, the spell has worn off, and she is gradually becoming a more sympathetic person. Ali Baba eventually realizes that he has no feelings for Briar Rose after all, but is in love with Lumi. Lumi discovers that she likes and is attracted to Ali Baba, and believes that love can grow from that. The two go back to Lumi's homeland, and start a new life together. Lumi would make an appearance in the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All the Land, being round up among many female Fables who were possible targets of an unknown murderer. It was eventually revealed that the murderer was Goldilocks. Goldilocks murdered both Lumi and Ali Baba. Cinderella, unfortunately, could only pick half of Goldilocks' victims to resurrect. She chose Lumi because, although Cinderella never knew the Adversary, she saw Lumi as a victim at his hands. The Snow Queen has repeatedly shown a sharp mind and a cunning aptitude. Tall and quite beautiful, she is generally surrounded by an aura of cold, to the extent that it's usually snowing in her vicinity, often to the annoyance of those around her, not that any of them would dare say anything. She is capable of pulling in the winter weather surrounding her if she so chooses, but rarely does so. She commands legions of frost creatures, including giants. She seems to have either always known who the true leader of the Empire was or has known for quite some time, as she has been repeatedly shown as one of Geppetto's closest and most trusted allies. Rodney and June Spies for the Adversary, Rodney and June started out as two of Geppetto's wooden children, Rodney a highly decorated junior officer in the forces assaulting the Arabian Fablelands and June a medic assigned temporarily to his unit. Meeting when Rodney was injured, the pair swiftly grew to enjoy each other's company and began to court each other, despite not really having much of a clue how to go about it. Eventually, Rodney wrote a letter to Geppetto, asking that they be made flesh, so that they could marry and be together properly. The letter was read before dispatch by Rodney's superior officer who was shocked by the content, as it revealed a number of facts about Geppetto's true position within the Empire that would cause immense problems should they get out. He initially locked Rodney up, unsure how to proceed, then ultimately relented. Destroying the letter, he announced that Geppetto should be reassured that there had been no letter and that the situation was under control and dispatched Rodney to do so, with June accompanying him to provide additional witness, observing quietly to the pair that had somebody wanted to ask Geppetto what had supposedly been in the non-existent letter, then it would make much more sense to ask him in person. Reaching Geppetto after months of travel, Rodney and June made their request. Geppetto talked with them for some hours, then told them that such a great gift would always come with a price and asked them to think about whether they'd be willing to pay it. Rodney and June accepted, were made flesh and were married in a grand ceremony presided over by the Emperor himself. They settled down happily and swiftly conceived a child. Shortly thereafter, they were visited by the Snow Queen, who explained the service that was required of them. They were briefed on life in America, then were sent through and were installed in a small apartment in New York under the name Greenwood, only a couple of blocks from Fabletown, with orders to spy on the Fables there and to study up on sabotage and murder techniques in case they're required to take a more active role. They write their reports in a journal which is magically linked to an identical volume in the Homelands. Orders are passed to them in the same way; occasionally they are provided with specific instructions detailing tasks to be carried out, sometimes involving violent acts. Though both appear to be highly ambivalent about what they do, and June in particular worries about how the recent birth of their daughter (Junebug) will affect things, they nevertheless remain loyal to the Empire - the magic that changed them to flesh ensures that. Rodney was one of the attendees at the Imperial conference called after Bigby's destruction of the magic grove. He was apparently horrified by the genocidal plan suggested for the mundane world by the Snow Queen and consulted with Pinocchio about how this could be prevented. In recent events, Pinocchio convinced Rodney and June to surrender to Fabletown authorities. Pinocchio also gave them the ability to defy the loyalty magic of Geppetto by explaining that although they need to do what is best for father Geppetto, they don't need to do what he orders since Geppetto may indeed be mentally unsound, and thus defying the empire might in fact be the best thing for Geppetto, since he is acting in a way that harms himself.Fables 72: Skullduggery Hansel Lord Hansel, of Hansel and Gretel fame, holds the position of Head of the Imperial Inquisition and is one of the most feared men in the Empire. After their misadventure in the Homelands involving Frau Totenkinder, whom the children push into her own oven, Hansel and Gretel emerge from the forests to find their land overrun by the Adversary's forces. They flee, staying ahead of the invading armies and taking sanctuary in one church after another until they learn of the mundane world. Arriving there in the mid-17th Century, they made their way to the newly established Fabletown, where they are shocked to discover Frau Totenkinder among the Fables already present. Hansel immediately demands her execution, only to be informed that, under the terms of the Fabletown Compact, Totenkinder had been granted amnesty for her actions in the Homelands. Disgusted, Hansel announces his intention to live among the mundane population, leaving his sister behind in Fabletown. Hansel moves to Europe, where he swiftly establishes a name for himself as a witch hunter, testifying in numerous trials and taking part enthusiastically in the executions. It reaches the point where his word is considered sufficient to convict a suspect of witchcraft. Hundreds of people are executed at his word. When the Salem witch trials break out in 1692, Hansel immediately returns to America to participate. Reports of his activities greatly concerned the Fabletown authorities, but as he remained within the letter of the Fabletown laws, no action can be taken against him. Nearby for the first time in many years, Hansel visits Fabletown, asking to see his sister. He begs her to leave Fabletown, as it has only been her presence that stops him from assembling the forces required to obliterate the place. Gretel refuses, explaining to him that she has spent time studying with Frau Totenkinder in the intervening years and has gained a new appreciation for the magic arts, seeing them not as the devil's work, but as a useful tool. Horrified and enraged, Hansel strikes her viciously with a chair, snapping her neck instantly. As no witnesses are present, he tries to claim that it had been an accident, but he is not believed. Hansel is stricken from the Fabletown Compact and banished forever. He continues with his witch-finding activities, but as time passes and the witch-hunts cease, his fame becomes infamy and he vanishes from the mundane world. Returning to the Homelands, Hansel is tasked with investigating and punishing any unauthorized use of sorcery. It is implied that his job is not to give alleged sorcerers fair trials but simply to stamp out illegal sorcery through terror. He is one of the attendees at the Imperial conference called after Bigby's destruction of the magic grove, although he is not apprised of the war plans outlined by the Snow Queen so that he could not reveal them were he to be subjected to interrogation. Geppetto designates him as the Empire's official envoy to Fabletown; however, his real mission in the mundane world is to recover Baba Yaga and the wooden soldiers and return them to the Homelands. He is initially given three years to accomplish this, as Geppetto is intent on a full-scale attack on the mundane world in 2009. His initial discussions with Fabletown, however, meet with no success, as Prince Charming, having been informed by Frau Totenkinder that the Empire has no real interest in negotiation and was beginning to mobilise for an invasion, simply stalls Hansel at every opportunity, making demands that the envoy finds increasingly outrageous. Hansel is next seen during the Skulduggery story-arc, where he and his men intercept Pinocchio in Santiago, Chile, as he returns to Fabletown from the Homelands. Pinocchio's escort, Cinderella, while initially also captured, is able to escape and rescue Pinocchio, slaying most of his captors. Uncertain whether Hansel is still officially an accredited envoy to Fabletown, Cinderella elects not to kill him and settles for shooting him in both knees. In The Great Fables Crossover, Kevin Thorn summons Hansel and Sam, hoping they can inspire him in writing his masterpiece. After numerous disagreements, Sam eventually dumps Hansel out of his wheelchair and off a cliff. The Nome King The much feared Nome King, also known as Roquat the Red, is from L. Frank Baum's tales of the land of Oz. He is the current ruler of that land, as well as many of the surrounding kingdoms and Imperial districts. He attended the Imperial conference called after the destruction of the magic grove and was positively delighted by the plans outlined by the Snow Queen for the effective genocide of the mundane population. He did feel, however, that the plan could be improved with his assistance, feeling that he had many minions that could be of great use. In the wake of the fall of the Adversary's Empire, the Nome King creates his own, pan-Ozian empire. He was killed during Bufkin's revolution, when the Nome King's own hanging rope magically came to life and snapped its master's head off. Max Piper The Pied Piper of Hamelin was the antagonist of Peter & Max: A Fables Novel. He was elder brother to Peter Piper, and a sorcerer powerful enough to face Frau Totenkinder in her place of power (Fabletown). Born in Hesse, the Homeland that mirrors German fables, Max and Peter's family were caught in the middle of a goblin invasion (under the supervision of the then-burgeoning Empire). The Piper family had a tradition of woodwinds performance, and passed down an ancient pipe named Frost from generation to generation. When Max was denied the inheritance in favor of his younger brother, he started to exhibit sociopathic tendencies, and ran away after murdering his father, lost during the invasion. During his wandering, he encountered Frau Totenkinder, who gave him the magical flute named Fire, an artifact of astounding potential. Over the course of Frau's trials and teaching, Max increased in power exponentially, which also came from sealing bargains with otherworldly powers. In exchange for the location of Frost from Totenkinder, he stole the children of Hamelin (whose parents had offended Totenkinder), exchanging their lives for the debts of his evil teachers. After a brief battle with Peter and suffering exile after being defeated by Peter, Max returned even more powerful as well as more intent on killing his brother. In the early 20th Century, he cast a curse that increased the lethality of the Spanish flu, at least in mundies. It caused stillbirths and extreme birth defects in Fable children, if not out and out sterility in Fables in general. After a battle with Totenkinder in New York, he was exiled again, only to return in the early 21st Century. He met his end in the mundy version of Hamelin at the hands of his brother, Peter Piper. Max has a brief flashback appearance in the graphic novel 1001 Nights of Snowfall and is referred to in issue 89 (Witches story arc), as well as the Fairest graphic novel Fairest in All the Land. Mister Dark A mysterious and extremely powerful entity with chalk white skin and black hair who later became the primary antagonist replacing the Adversary. Trapped by the Boxing League, a division of Warlocks specialized in capturing and containing the most dangerous of magical threats, during the expansion of the empire, Mister Dark was contained within a stone box which drained his power and transmitted it to be used by the Adversary. Looters mistakenly released the creature who proceeded to drain them of life. Mister Dark reacquired his stolen power including a portion that powered the Witching Cloak, destroyed the enchantments that held the Fabletown buildings together and set off to Fabletown to seek revenge. Upon arrival, he captured and then killed Kay, as well as a few hundred New York residents for the construction of his new palace. A composite character like Jack and Frau Totenkinder, he represents every version of the boogeyman. Other names for him are The Dullahan, The Khokhan, The Buse, M√∂rk√∂, The Dunganga, The Abo Ragl Ma Slokha, Burned man, the lake man, Buback and the Torbalan along with many other names. He is the same \\"kind\\" as Baba Yaga. Mister Dark's primary source of power is the fear of those who surround him. The more that fear him, the greater his power becomes; if he is surrounded by those who possess little fear, he becomes weaker. He can swallow the teeth of any human or human-like Fable, and can later raise them as his loyal Witherling slaves at his leisure by spitting out one of the swallowed teeth. Mr. Dark was killed when the North Wind brought him up into the North Wind's own realm of elemental ice and wind. There, Mr. North entered his Casket of Primordial Winds (a suicide mechanism kept in case he got tired of this life, since nothing much could harm him) and took Mr. Dark with him, killing them both. Fairy Godmother After the fall of the Empire, an unknown, powerful magic user from another realm invaded the Homelands kingdom of Ultima Thule. The usurper eventually turned out to be Cinderella's fairy godmother, as seen in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love. Cinderella, Fabletown's secret agent, was able to uncover the identity of the usurper and put an end to the Fairy Godmother's dictatorship. However, she could not bring herself to kill her, and instead turned her over to Ultima Thule's citizens for punishment. It is unknown what became of her after this. The story implied that Briar Rose and Cinderella shared the same fairy godmother. This seems to have been proven apocryphal in the Fairest story arc Wide Awake (where none of Briar's fairy seven godmothers look anything her); however, the Fables Encyclopedia refers to Cinderella's fairy godmother as a meddler in Briar Rose's life, indicating that there may have been more fairy godmothers involved than what was shown in Fairest. The Fairy Godmother had two sisters, one with green and one with blue wings, while she herself has pink wings (like Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather from Disney's Sleeping Beauty). Her sisters were killed by Frau Totenkinder, who was the Fairy Godmother's enemy who often ruined her spells. The Fairy Godmother also showed Rapunzel's prince the way to the tower that Frau kept her in, mainly to spite Totenkinder. She attacked Ultima Thule because she wanted to make the worlds a better place, and decided it was time to force people to be happy. Her catchphrases are \\"reality is only what we make of it\\" and \\"you can't go to ball without breaking few pumpkins.\\" The Fairy Godmother also appears in flashbacks from Rapunzel's story in the Fairest story arc The Hidden Kingdom. It is revealed that she kept the prince from seeing Rapunzel again, as the godmother had plans for her. It's hinted she may have had a hand in the abduction of Rapunzel's daughters. Although, if she was the one to kidnap them, it is not known where she took them, since they weren't present with her when Cinderella found her in Ultima Thule. Dorothy Gale Dorothy Gale is first seen in Jack of Fables, as one of the many Fable prisoners at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village. Her story is told in the Fables spin off Cinderella: Fables Are Forever, where it is revealed that the former innocent farm girl became a professional killer for hire, going by the code \\"Silverslipper\\". She went on to become Cinderella's greatest nemesis. It is revealed that Dorothy developed a taste for killing for hire after she, as seen in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, killed the Wicked Witch of the West in exchange for a trip back home. She had already killed the Wicked Witch of the East by accident when Dorothy's house landed on her, and was given a pair of magic silver slippers from the Good Witch of the North as a reward. When the Wizard heard that Dorothy had already taken care of one witch, he hired her to kill another. Dorothy took the job, and discovered that she liked it. After Glinda the Good Witch explained to her about the powers of the magic slippers, Dorothy used them to fly home to the Homelands version of Kansas. To her great despair, the slippers fell off over the Deadly Desert of Oz. Dorothy and a few of her friends, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion and Toto made it into the mundy world in the year of 1943. They had fled from Oz years before, ahead of the invading armies of the Adversary, and had been on the run ever since. The Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion hid out on the Jersey pine barrens, while Dorothy sought out Fabletown to find them all a safe haven. However, Dorothy reacted negatively to the terms in the Fabletown compact and stormed off in anger, refusing to let anyone \\"tie her hands like that\\". She left her friends behind and walked off with Toto in her arms, feeling that the others were dead weight. Dorothy created a new life for herself as a killer for hire in the mundy world, and had no trouble finding work. She eventually crossed paths with Fabletown spy Cinderella, who ran into Dorothy during several of Cindy's secret missions for Fabletown. Dorothy repeatedly tells Cindy that they are exactly the same, but that she is better than Cindy. Cindy denies that, stating she killed to protect Fables and humans, while Dorothy kills for fun. The two have several violent encounters over the years, until Cindy almost finishes Dorothy off in Switzerland in 1986 by throwing Dorothy off a cliff. The unconscious Dorothy is found by Mr. Revise's people and is imprisoned at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village where she is thrown down Revise's memory hole. When she emerges, she is stripped of most of her memories and is again the same innocent girl she had been so long ago. The years passed, with Dorothy living in a fog unable to think straight. When the Golden Boughs s destroyed, the memory hole is destroyed with it, reviving all of Dorothy's memories. As mentioned in a conversation between the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man during the final Jack of Fables story arc, Dorothy then struck off on her own. The Lions mentions that she got \\"all dark\\", and the Tin Man responds that Dorothy always was \\"kind of creepy\\". As seen in Cinderella: Fables Are Forever, she begins plotting her revenge on Cinderella. Remembering where she lost the silver slippers, Dorothy returns to the Deadly Desert and retrieves them by hanging off an aircraft on a rope, careful not to touch the deadly sand. She recruits the Spoon Brigade from The Emerald City of Oz, Bungle, the Glass Cat and a Chiss to assist her in her plan for revenge. When Mr. Kadabra is mysteriously killed by an unknown assailant, all signs points to Cinderella's nemesis from the old. Cindy sets out to find her, aided by Ivan Durak of Shadow Fabletown, who claims that Dorothy has been hired to kill him. Eventually, both are abducted and taken to the Deadly Desert of Oz, where Dorothy is waiting. Before they reach their destination, both manage to escape in the middle of the desert. Cindy is ready to face Dorothy, but Ivan drugs her, and she wakes up tied to a chair, Dorothy standing before her with Toto at her side. (Toto had previously been killed during the mass escape from the Golden Boughs, but, as Priscilla Page points out during the Jack of Fables story arc \\"The (Nearly) Great Escape\\", \\"killed Fables often get magically replaced by new versions of the same Fables\\".) In a surprising plot twist, it is revealed that Dorothy was Ivan all along (the real Ivan has been dead for a long time; most likely sometime between the 1980s or her escape from Mr. Revise), disguising herself using her magic silver slippers. Cindy manages to persuade Dorothy to untie her and fight her in a real battle, in which Cindy steals the silver slippers and pushes Dorothy from a great height into the Deadly Desert, apparently killing her, though her body is not seen. Dorothy has a brief appearance in the Fables story \\"In Those Days\\", in a flashback that shows the death of Mister Kadabra. As previously implied, it was Dorothy who killed him. Dorothy is also referred to in the story arc \\"Cubs in Toyland\\". Hadeon the Destroyer The evil fairy from Sleeping Beauty. She appears in the Fairest story arc Wide Awake. She is the ruler of the Forest of Dire Blight, in the Homelands. Even though she was the one to actually cast the curse over Briar Rose, the Fables story arc War and Pieces and Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love implies that Frau Totenkinder was its creator. In Fairest, Briar defeats Hadeon once and for all when the latter shows up to pick a fight with the Snow Queen - because Hadeon likes to pick a fight every century or so, to keep her tools honed. Hadeon nearly defeats Lumi, but Briar, wanting revenge for what Hadeon did to her as a baby, decides to take matters into her own hands. It is revealed that because Hadeon cast the curse on Briar Rose all those years ago, Briar has become immune to her magic. Briar defeats Hadeon with a few solid punches to the jaw. Her fairy godmothers turn Hadeon into a car that can travel to any world, and the spaces between worlds. The car has to serve one thousand times before it will revert to Hadeon. Briar uses the car to get back to Fabletown, before lending it to Bigby Wolf, who is searching for his lost cubs, Darien and Therese. When the car has been used nine hundred and ninety-nine times, Briar plans to take it to the junkyard and have Hadeon destroyed once and for all by dropping it into a car crusher. However, Hadeon is not as helpless as she seems. In the graphic novel Fairest In All the Land, she seeks revenge on the people who enslaved her, and uses her magic to manipulate Goldilocks into murdering several of the powerful women of Fabletown, and other Fables, resulting in fourteen Fables being killed. Cinderella is able to bring the victims back to life, but can only choose half of them. The Thirteenth Floor Fables proceeds to drain most of the magic out of Hadeon (still in car form), rendering her relatively helpless. In the last Briar Rose tale, \\"The Last Big Sleep\\", Sleeping Beauty uses her thousandth ride on Hadeon to ride to the 'end of the universe'. She pricks herself asleep as Hadeon will float through space forever. Prince Brandish/Werian Holt The prince from Snow White and Rose Red. Unlike in the fairy tale, the prince did not marry Snow White, as his father, the king, refused to let Brandish marry a common peasant girl. Also unlike the fairy tale, Brandish's interest in marrying Snow comes from a desire for the magical power that he can sense in Snow and Rose Red rather than from love and gratitude. There is hint that Brandish's dark side extends farther than others imagine. In a flashback, he recalls how he murdered his own mother when he spied on her having sex with his father. Stating that he found what they did \\"nasty\\", that a queen should be pure and chaste; and that his mother shouldn't act like an animal. Centuries later, he assumed the name of Werian Holt, and was brought to the mundy world by Mr. Dark to serve as fencing instructor for Mrs. Spratt. Though his connection is never really explained or how he came to work for Mr. Dark. After Mr. Dark's death, he begins to teach the transformed Mrs. Sprat the art of assassination, and becomes her co-conspirator on an unknown dark plan for Fabletown. When the Fables come to claim Dark's castle as their own, both Spratt and Holt pretend to have been Mr. Dark's prisoners. He has recently revealed himself to Snow, much to Sprat's surprise and disdain (as she knew nothing of his past and was still very bitter to Snow). He forcefully tries to take claim on Snow as his legal wife, because they promised to marry each other back in the Homelands. Snow tries pushing away his advances, but he's very determined to have her and plans to kill Bigby and all of the children she had with him and make her replace the children with his own human children. Somehow, he learned about Ghost's existence (a secret shared only by Bigby, Snow White, their cubs and Frau Totenkinder). It is unknown whether or not other characters present during his confrontation with Bigby overheard him mentioning Ghost's secret existence. While Bigby is away, Brandish takes Snow captive and locks her up in one of the towers in Mr. Dark's castle. He bewitches himself so that any injury inflicted on him will also hurt Snow, making any attempt at rescue complicated. When Snow attacks him in an attempt to free herself, he breaks her arm to teach her a lesson. Snow vows to kill him herself. Bigby eventually arrives to free his wife, but Brandish transforms him into a statue made of glass. Snow eventually manages to escape, while Morgan le Fay manages to break the spell that Brandish put on himself. Snow utilizes the fencing lessons once given to her by her ex- husband, Prince Charming, and engages Brandish in a sword duel. Even with a broken arm, and much to Brandish's surprise, Snow manages to gain the upper hand, and stabs him through the heart--but not before Brandish shatters the statue of Bigby. However, as Doctor Swineheart performs an autopsy on the fallen prince, Brandish awakens just as Swineheart discovers a cavity where the prince's heart should be, with rune-etched brass fittings capping off the various branches of the circulatory system that would normally connect to a human heart. It is revealed that he had his heart magically removed from his own body, making him difficult to kill. Rose Red takes Brandish captive and offers him an ultimatum: He can spend the rest of his immortal life buried in concrete, or serve her and her new Round Table. Brandish accepts. This has caused a great barrier between Rose and her sister. Snow, for obvious reasons, wishes to him gone and possibly vengeance for her husband's loss. Mrs. Sprat Mrs. Sprat, whose first name is Leigh, works as a nurse in the Knights of Malta Hospital special research wing and like the poem says, she is indeed fat. Mrs. Sprat was mostly seen as a dutiful nurse for the most part. She is often nagging at Bigby Wolf for smoking inside the hospital. She was later seen complaining to Mayor Charming that he was behind in financing the hospital and was also invited to Snow and Bigby's wedding. Her husband was another of Ghost's victims. In Fables #100, Beauty goes into early labor and Beast desperately tries to get her to help him and to get the doctor. Though she appears polite, she ignores his pleas, which irritate Beast; something that Snow notices right away. Nearly causing a horrible confrontation, but is nearly evaded. Snow White scolds her for being nasty, spiteful attitude towards Sheriff Beast and Beauty. Snow explains that, while one can get away with being mean if she is beautiful, one can also get away with being hideous if she's pleasant, and since Mrs. Sprat is both ugly and mean she will have to do something about her attitude before someone has had enough of her. On the verge of tears, Mrs. Sprat reveals that she hates all the beautiful Fables, and became a nurse for the chance to have any of them under her care and at her mercy. She reveals she'd like to see all of them end up the way Boy Blue did. When the Fables depart for Haven, Mrs. Sprat stays behind, unbeknownst to everyone else. When Mister Dark shows up at the Farm looking for the other Fables, she offers to reveal their location for three things: to become beautiful, for all the other beautiful Fables to become ugly like her, and for a prince to love her with \\"true love\\". Mister Dark agrees to all three conditions, and the two depart together. Mr. Dark shows Nurse Sprat how to make herself beautiful by exercising and fighting her eating disorder by eating more lean and less fat. Mrs. Sprat is delighted with the great progress, but eventually becomes impatient with her transformation and asks Mr. Dark to speed up the process, however painful it may be. While Mrs. Sprat is screaming and writhing in pain, Mr. Dark transforms her into a beautiful, young woman in a black dress. Mr. Dark then leaves to deal with the Fables, and promises to summon Mrs. Sprat to his side so that she will be there to see the beautiful Fables be made ugly before they die. He also plans to make her his bride and the mistress of Castle Dark, his fortress in New York City. Sprat adopts her maiden name, Douglas, since the name Sprat is from a dead past. However, Mr. Dark is killed by Mr. North, the North Wind, before any of his plans are carried through. When Leigh's fellow Fables come to claim the castle as their own following Mr. Dark's death, Leigh dresses in rags and hides in a dungeon, pretending to have been Dark's prisoner, and claims that the reason for her slim figure is that Dark starved her. The only chance her rouse could have been discovered was through Grimble who found Brandish's tale of them being prisoners false. But since Brandish has transformed him, its unknown how long her secret will remain a secret. Since her transformation she's tried gaining favor with King Cole and has been approached by Dr. Swineheart who has interest in her now, much to her shock. Though she appears to be acting like one of them, she still holds bitterness towards the Fables. At the end of Camelot arc, it is revealed that she has stolen the last glass piece that could help resurrect Bigby. She declares to be embracing the darkness that her intended Mr. Dark did once.

After the Battle of Fabletown, the anchorman on the news show Thorn worked for reported an out-of-control block party, a building fire and a gang fight in the Upper West Side; minutes later, the details were fading from everyone's head but Kevin's. After reporting this to his boss, he was fired for \\"going all X-Files\\". Kevin has now dedicated himself to discovering what exactly is going on in the Upper West Side.

This house is also now occupied by Hansel and his staff, though Kevin seems unaware of their true identities. In Kevin's free time (when not spying on Fabletown residents), he is writing a book describing what it is he has discovered of the Fables. He has been keeping an eye on them for long enough now to be familiar with many of the regulars and has noticed the disappearance of several - Bigby Wolf, Snow White, Boy Blue and so forth - linked with references to \\"The Farm\\". He has come to the conclusion that \\"the Farm\\" is actually a euphemism for execution, giving him the mistaken impression that the Fables willingly kill their own without reservation. He is aware that Tommy Sharp was also investigating Fabletown and was subsequently murdered, which has only served to heighten his misgiving about the Fables. During the Jack of Fables arc The Bad Prince the reason for Thorn being able to see through the Fables' illusions is finally given: he is, in fact, a Literal, beings who are like Fables, but represent literary devices rather than actual characters. Like many Fables, though, he was taken to Golden Boughs Retirement Village and was stripped of his memories so that he could be made into an ordinary human being. When he begins to regain his memories, he is recaptured so that the process can be repeated. In that process, it is implied he is one of the most powerful Literals in existence, and the soldiers sent to capture him imply that even all of them with their guns could only irritate him, at best, if he fought back. Nonetheless, they manage to bring him back peacefully, where it is revealed Revise is actually his son, and the Pathetic Fallacy is his father. It seems that he became a mundane by choice, and doesn't refuse the notion of losing his memories again. It later emerges in the storyline Jack's Big Book of War that Kevin has powers leading to the creation of Fables themselves; however, it has not yet emerged what they actually are. It seems that Kevin refers to Fables as his creations and he consents to the revisions of his son Revise as the lesser of two evils, in an attempt to protect them from his other son Bookburner. In The Great Fables Crossover he's revealed to be truly the creator of the Fables, the embodiment of the storytelling. Having been able to break in a new pen, after destroying the pen (a simple goose- feather) used to write the Fables (and possibly the mundys as well) in the attempt to stop the Writer's Block, he becomes displeased with the current events, as the Fables themselves had grown beyond his control (he explicitly claims that Geppetto's transformation in the dreaded Adversary was something he couldn't even fathom), and decided to uncreate them, rebuilding a new world from scratch. After Jack Frost II is able to stop him from writing the literal word end to the universe, Dex, the Deus Ex Machina and the most powerful of the Literals, creates a new, empty universe for the Literals to inhabit and fill out as they please. Despite having a new occasion to create, Kevin expresses displeasure and worries, as after thousands of years spent dreaming the end of the universe, he's unable to write out a beginning to a new universe. Pathetic Fallacy The Golden Boughs Retirement Village is also home to a man known as the Pathetic Fallacy, although he comes to prefer being called Gary, who has the powers of that concept. His precise status at the facility was somewhat unclear; while he did Revise's bidding, appearing to have his trust and carry out a number of minor staff duties, he was also kind and sympathetic and aided the escape plan. It is later revealed that the Pathetic Fallacy is a Literal, an extremely powerful magical being of a different kind to the Fables, in that he personifies a literary concept rather than being a character from literature. He was the father of Kevin Thorn and grandfather to Revise, although he appears to only be aware of this on occasion. The Pathetic Fallacy traveled with Jack Horner, taking on the role of his sidekick, being somewhat naive and frequently confused, although he had lucid moments when he shows a great deal of knowledge about how stories work. He regards inanimate objects (which are, of course, generally quite animate in his presence) as friends and talks to them frequently. In one of his lucid moments, he refuses to join the Literals in the new universe created for them by the Deus ex Machina and willingly sacrifices his powers. Reasoning that the new universe will develop a Pathetic Fallacy when the need will arise, he returns at Jack's side. After Jack Horner transformed into a dragon, The Pathetic Fallacy hid him in a cave where he had piles of gold. It was revealed he entered a brief marriage with a woman and sold some of the original books in exchange for cows (for Jack to eat, as opposed to other people, namely the women he brings back to the cave). When Jack Frost arrives to slay the dragon (not realizing the dragon is his biological father), the Pathetic Fallacy rushes to Jack Horner's defense, destroying the Fulminate Blade. As a result, Jack Frost shoots him, which kills him since he had been living as a Mundy. Mr. Revise Mr. Revise is in overall charge of the Golden Boughs Retirement Village. His exact status is unclear, but he is descended from Literals, a group of magical beings who, unlike the Fables, who are characters from story, appear to personify literary concepts. He seems to embody the concept of the editor, in that he revises the universe so that it makes perfect sense. He is the son of Kevin Thorn and the grandson of the Pathetic Fallacy, though he appears older than both of them. As such, Revise holds a considerable amount of supernatural power. Revise considers his role to be \\"neutering\\" Fables partly by stripping them of their darker elements, with his ultimate goal being to rid the world of magic. He had been close to accomplishing that before the Fabletown refugees made their way to this mundane world. Tying into Revise's intention to destroy magic, The Golden Bough was originally written by Sir James Frazer to show that even the \\"enlightened\\" faiths of the 19th Century were descended from the most superstitious and primitive. Like Frazer, Mr. Revise appears to be a modernist who wants to abolish superstition. In the end of the Great Fables Crossover, he's revealed in a more sympathetic light, as it is mentioned that keeping the laws of physics constant over time had been his idea, making science possible. It's also pointed out that he's been a stabilizing force against whims of Kevin Thorn, who could justify any event by claiming poetic license. Eventually, he decides to follow his father in the new universe created by the Deus ex Machina. The Page Sisters The three Page sisters serve Revise directly as the senior librarians of the Golden Boughs Retirement Village, each with their own speciality. Robin Page is in charge of security, training the tigers and so forth, Priscilla Page handles retrievals, the capture of Fables and bringing them back to the facility, while Hillary Page runs the research department. It was revealed, in Jack of Fables #26, that the sisters have two different fathers; Hillary is the daughter of Revise, while Priscilla and Robin are Bookburner's daughters. The Page sisters all appear to be relatively young, are attractive and all three have slept with Jack Horner, something that he takes considerable pride in having achieved, though he also shows horror after learning that they are his half sisters. Hillary spends some time traveling with Jack after his escape from Golden Boughs, but left after discovering that he'd slept with both of her sisters before her and is now helping the Bookburner, Revise's brother and the father of her two sisters, track the fugitives. After the revelation that Jack was their half-brother through their shared mother, Prose Page, they were horrified to realize that they'd committed incest. Hillary was disgusted, Priscilla was enraged, and Robin was speechless. Bill Willingham has revealed in an interview that the Page sisters are the embodiment of organizing and codifying (in this case Fables) The sisters have some mystical abilities as a result of their Literal heritage. Libraries are Hillary's place of power, while the open road is Priscilla's. She claims to know \\"shortcuts to anywhere,\\" which she uses to reach Kevin Thorn's hideout ahead of Snow White and Bigby. It is implied that all three sisters give up their powers when they decide to stay in the Fables universe instead of accompanying the other literals into the new one provided by \\"Dex\\" (Deus Ex Machina, the Literal embodiment of the dramatic concept) - however, Robin seems to be able to communicate with a stone lion at the end of Jack of Fables (unless she was just acting crazy and actually found another way to unlock a secret passage). The sisters decide to travel the world with their nephew, the current Jack Frost. Hillary and Priscilla appear to have motherly attitudes toward him to him while Robin seemed to be following along out of reluctance: the former later advises Jack Frost to cast aside his wintry powers and find his way by himself, thus separating from him and paving for their favorite nephew the path of the hero. After becoming mortals, the sisters lived as normal \\"mundies\\" for years. Robin had a baby, Sammy Junior, with Sam after a one- night stand with the former Golden Boughs prisoner. The sisters eventually got tired of life as mere mortals doomed to grow old and die, and started searching for Revise's books of original, unrevised Fable stories, knowing that the original books would make them immortal once more. The search brought the sisters to a dragon, who was in fact a transformed Jack Horner; Jack had stolen the books when the Golden Boughs were destroyed. The sisters arrived at the same times as several former Golden Boughs prisoners, who were on a quest of their own, searching for Fabletown. The sisters went after the books while shooting at the dragon, which made the dragon burn the books - he was tired of them anyway - in anger. The sisters, upset at the loss of the books, started shooting everyone around them, thinking that since they were doomed to die without the books, everyone else could just as well die with them. This made some of the Fables retaliate and all three of the sisters were killed; Humpty Dumpty fired his cannon at Priscilla, the Tin Man killed Hillary by firing a laser through her chest with his tin cannon, and the Cowardly Lion mauled Robin to death. In \\"Fairest : In All The Lands\\", it is revealed that the Page Sisters used to either live in Fabletown or visit it, as they talked to a seer in a laundry who foresaw their death in a cave, as later seen in \\"Jack Of Fables : The End\\" (which led them to just decide to avoid that cave, until they gave up and accepted their fate). This is rather perplexing, as their existence was forgotten by Bigby and Snow White, by the end of \\"The Great Fables Crossover\\" - thus making it impossible for anyone in fabletown to know or recognise them (unless they managed to reintroduce themselves a second time after the crossover). The New Jack Frost - \\"Jack Two\\" or \\"Jack Too\\" His real name is Evelyn-Lawrence-Pinder-Shinks-Cobblepewter, uttered in its entirety once by his caretaker Vrumptus. Son of Jack Horner and the Snow Queen, nephew of the Page Sisters, and so one-quarter Literal and three- quarters Fable himself, Jack Frost is the estranged son of Jack Horner, conceived by Lumi and Jack when Jack Horner, trying to harness the wintry powers and the riches of the Snow Queen for himself, romanced the still naive and gullible Lumi. As a result of his predictable betrayal, Lumi hardened her heart, becoming the cold, ruthless villainess shown in the series, lavishing the young Jack with all her bottled and repressed love. It is unexplained why she would give her son such a name. But whatever the reason for his name, Jack shows no ill will to his mother or his caretaker Vrumptus. He seems to care for and love both as family and knows very well of his father's treatment to his mother. As a result, owing to Lumi's duties as an adviser for the ominous Adversary, young Jack lives a sheltered life along with his majordomo Vrumptus, growing into a sickly, frail child. When at the climax of the war between Fabletown and the Empire, as shown in War and Pieces, Lumi immediately falls permanently asleep because of Briar Rose's curse, her wintry powers seek Jack, turning him into the second Jack Frost (essentially a male version of the Snow Queen), imbuing him with several powers, such as the absolute mastery over cold and snow of his mother, the ability to travel between dimensions and the mystical ability to track Jack Horner. After receiving his powers one of the first things he does is to change his name which he decides to call himself Jack. Although briefly distracted by of the similarities between Wicked John and Jack Horner, Jack Frost manages to find his father at the Farm. Jack Horner, annoyed by his son's childish insistence, tricks him into believing that he must first complete a great quest before he has the right to ask his father any questions. With this objective in mind, Jack Frost takes part in the battle between Fables and Literals, ultimately turning the tide in favor of the Fables by freezing Kevin Thorn before he can write an end for the current universe. When the Literals leave the main universe to write a new one, Jack Frost stays back with his aunts, the Page Sisters, forswearing his bumbling father and unsure of his future. On Hillary and Priscilla's advice, Jack Frost divests himself of Lumi's powers. However, to his great surprise, instead or returning the meek, sickly kid he was, he turns into a quite handsome young man with the stamina and physical prowess of his father and the innate ability to hop between dimensions. Joining forces with Gepetto's wooden owl, briefly tasked by the Adversary in spying the Homelands, whom he names \\"McDuff\\", he starts a career as a hero for hire, with McDuff acting as the brains of the operation, and the good-natured, courageous, but trusty and still naive Jack acting as the brawn. Bookburner Son of Kevin Thorn, brother to Revise and father to Priscilla and Robin Page. Bookburner takes a different approach in dealing with magic to his brother, choosing to burn books completely, effectively removing those characters from existence. He does, however, claim to keep copies in what he refers to as his 'private collection', which appears to give him power over what remains of those characters, allowing him to compel them to act on his behalf. He has not been seen since the destruction of the Golden Boughs Retirement Village. The Genres A group of Literals who are the embodiment of the different genres found in story telling. The known genres are: *Western, who looks like John Wayne. He can sense Bigby's actions, because they both are sheriffs. He likes to play cards (possibly poker) alone. *Blockbuster, a dimwitted, musclebound commando who can sense when explosions happen. He resembles Rambo. *Mystery, a very silent woman whose face is always covered by a black veil. *Horror, a terrifying little girl. She can even scare Kevin Thorne. *Romance, a beautiful red head. *Science-Fiction, twin brother to his sister Fantasy *Fantasy, an elven woman with pointy ears *Super-hero, younger brother of Science-Fiction and Fantasy. Known to be constantly dying and resurrected (like Western). *Literature, who holds the others in contempt. *Noir, who looks and acts like Sam Spade as portrayed by Humphry Bogart. He can solve some cases without needing to be physically present and he also managed to sneak up on everybody in the room, when they were summoned by Kevin. *Comedy, who looks and acts like Groucho Marx. He makes no difference between \\"a muse\\" and \\"amuse\\". *War, who looks and acts like a soldier from World War II. Other Literals *Writer's Block: Kevin Thorne's twin brother. He looks exactly like Thorne, but has the appearance of a mental patient. Writer's Block presence muddles Kevin's creativity and prevents him from writing the end of the world. Though Writer's Block is always close to his brother, Thorne doesn't notice him until he accidentally touches him. In order to continue with his plans, Thorne murders Writer's Block - again, because even if he knows his brother will come back to life later on, he'll be dead long enough for Kevin to finish his work. *Dex (Deus Ex Machina, the Literal embodimement of the dramatic concept), arguably one of the most powerful of the Literals, but only under very specific circumstances. He can solve all problems, but only when doing so is impossible by any other means. He can appear out of nowhere, but he cannot work miracles, as he can only work \\"once per story, usually toward the d√©noument\\". *Eliza Wall: A Literal and temporary narrator of the Jack of Fables series and represents the fourth wall, a theatre concept now also adapted to any storytelling device (Movies, literature etc.). She also has siblings - of whom nothing is known, except that, unlike her, they have no fourth wall awareness, as they do not understand it when she directly speaks to the readers. *Prose Page: Jack Horner's mother, who gave birth to Jack after an affair with a Fable, Prince Charming. She later gave birth to the Page sisters, Hillary with Revise and Priscilla and Robin with Bookburner. *Onomatopoeia: Little is known about Onomatopoeia, though is mentioned by Revise after escaping the Golden Boughs Retirement Village. *Foreshadowing: Little is known about Foreshadowing but that she is a female, though is mentioned by Revise after escaping the Golden Boughs.

In 1544 the art of refining sugar was first practised in England by Cornelius Bussine and four partners, of whom Chester was one. These adventurers set up two sugar bakeries which continued without rivals for twenty years and brought great profit to the proprietors.John Strype, A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster (1720), V.xv, 'The Temporal Government': Refiners of Sugar, p. 244.

In June 1560, with Sir William Garrard and Thomas Lodge (then Sheriff), he was among the principal mourners at the public funeral of Anthony Hussey.Diary of Henry Machyn, pp. 236-37. Hussey's will (in which he further endowed Edmund Campion) shows his closeness to Chester, before whom his final codicil was declared in 1560, but his executors were Thomas Lodge and Benjamin Gonson.Will of Anthony Hussey (P.C.C. 1560 (Mellershe)). On 23 July 1560 occurred the funeral of his first wife, Dame Elizabeth Chester, daughter of Thomas Lovett of Astwell Castle, Northamptonshire. By her he had six sons and eight daughters, three of whom died in infancy. It was a very grand ceremony, with a procession of 100 men in new gowns and women likewise, aldermen and heralds with pennons, and singing clerks to St Edmund, Lombard Street, the street and church hung with black cloth and armorials.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 240. Thomas Becon gave her funeral sermon. For her monument Chester composed Latin verses of valediction.John Strype, A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster (1720), II.ix, pp. 156-57. (HRIonline/University of Sheffield). The verses are shown in correct measure in Waters, Chester of Chicheley, I, at p. 35. The monument was destroyed in the Great Fire of London. Amid these solemnities he was elected Lord Mayor (in succession to Sir William Hewett), assuming office towards the close of that year, and on 3 October his sons Thomas and John were admitted to freedom of the Drapers' Company by patrimony.(ROLLCO). In April 1561 obsequies were resumed when Dame Alice Hewett died and was buried at St Martin Orgar with an immense procession of mourners, heralds, the livery of the Clothworkers, and the aldermen with Chester the Lord Mayor in their midst.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 256.

Queen Elizabeth spoke of Chester in a dispatch of 27 September 1571 as one of her greatest and best merchants trading with the Shah. His last move as alderman, from 1566 to 1573, was to the Langbourn ward,Beavan, The Aldermen of London, II, p. 34. in which stood his house in Lombard Street close by the George Inn.Note, in J.G. Nichols (ed.), The Diary of Henry Machyn, Citizen and Merchant-Taylor of London, Camden Society (London 1848), Original Series Vol. XLII, p. 381. On 2 May 1567 the Senate of the University of Cambridge awarded him an honorary M.A. degree. His fourth and fifth terms as Master of the Drapers were consecutive, in 1567‚Äì68 and 1568‚Äì69.Beavan, The Aldermen of London, II, p. 34. In November 1567, at St Lawrence Pountney, he married his second wife Joan, daughter of John Turner of London, and widow of William Beswicke (died 1567Will of Willeam Beswicke, Draper of London (P.C.C. 1567).), alderman and Draper (a Warden in Chester's Mastership of 1559). This union affirmed their Offley kinship, since Joan's daughter Agnes had married William Offley and Chester's daughter Jane was wife of Richard Offley, Merchant Taylors, both half-brothers of Sir Thomas.Waters, Chester of Chicheley, I, p. 36 and note. In 1571 he was appointed to the special commission of oyer and terminer for the trial for high treason of John Felton, who had published the Papal bull of Regnans in Excelsis against Queen Elizabeth.Fourth Report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records, February 28, 1843, (By Command, HMSO London 1843), p. 265. Dame Joan died in 1572 and was buried on 23 December in St Lawrence's church beside her first husband. Chester became a Fellow-commoner of his college, and subscribed to a petition to amend the university statutes on 6 May 1572. Soon afterwards he retired from business and resigned from the aldermanry. He devoted his last years to the pursuit of classical and theological learning at the University of Cambridge. The date of his death is not known. A litigation noted in the King's Remembrancer, Barons' depositions, dated in the Hilary term of 16 Elizabeth (1574) refers to 'the goods of Sir William Chester deceased, late alderman of the city of London.'The National Archives, Discovery Catalogue, item description E 133/1/199.

They had sons: * William Chester of London, son and heir, Constable of Wisbech Castle, married Judith, daughter and coheir of Anthony Cave of Chicheley, Buckinghamshire. They had one son and heir, Anthony Chester. William and Judith were married in 1558, the year after William was made free of the Draper's Company.(ROLLCO). Judith (born 1542) was cousin to William on the Lovett side: her grandfather Thomas Lovett (1495‚Äì1523) was elder half-brother to William Chester's mother. William and Judith resided mostly in London but Anthony became master of Chicheley, which remained in the Chester family for many generations.Waters, Chester of Chicheley, I, pp. 41-88.

These are the Fables who live in the Fable Homelands. Colonel Bearskin and \\"Bearskin's Free Company\\" These were some of the Fables who died defending the Last Free Gateway from the Homelands, as seen in The Last Castle. Every year, on 15 May, the people who were on the last boat out of the Homelands would get together to drink to the memory of those who died so they could get out to the Mundy World. Among the defenders were: *Colonel Bearskin, the colonel of \\"Bearskin's Free Company\\", the Fables who held back the Adversary's forces and tried to hold their last unconquered territory. It is said that he fought in many famous battles. He was known for his cunning battle strategies which were the reason that the territory held as long as it did. He also cared for the safety of the people who had loved ones and sent them on the boat to Fabletown. Boy Blue was his orderly, and he gave Boy Blue the witching cloak so Blue would live to tell the tale of the battle and so he could escape to be with Red Riding Hood. He was the one of the last of the Fables that stayed to fight to be killed; he was stabbed in the side and died slowly while the Adversary's troops mocked him. *The Valiant Little Tailor, identified through the text on his clothes, which says, \\"seven at one stroke\\". He was killed by goblins early in the battle. In addition, his name can seen on one of Kevin Thorn‚Äôs books in the Jack of Fables story arc The Bad Prince. *The Red Cross Knight, who almost won the battle all on his own, and could not be beaten, \\"not by goblin or troll or giant. Not by the dozens or the hundreds.\\" He was finally killed when the enemy set a dragon against him. *Herman Von Starkenfaust, from Washington Irving's short story The Spectre Bridegroom. According to Boy Blue, he turned out not being a ghost after all. *Britomart: Her final action before being killed, was throwing her magical spear, which would find any target she set for it, killing the general leading the Adversary's forces. *Robin O'The Woods (Robin Hood), aka \\"Loxley\\": When the last ship out of the Homelands was leaving, Robin Hood (previously seen in flashbacks in the Legends in Exile story arc, while fleeing the Adversary's forces) chose to stay behind and defend the Gateway, to avenge his Marian, who was killed when the invaders took his homeland. *The Merry Men, including Friar Tuck and John Small, died side by side with Bearskin's Free Company. *Tam Lin, who was claimed to be the knight loved by the queen of the faeries. He had a reputation of a scoundrel, but after winning a place for himself on the last ship out of the Homelands, he gave it to his young page instead *The King of Madagao and the King of Bornegascar, old enemies, from Fantastic Fables by Ambrose Bierce. *The ancient King Pellinore: His rusty armor kept trying to fall apart during his weeks defending the Gateway, and his squire had to follow him around, retrieving the pieces that were dropped off in his way. The Cardinal Winds=The North Wind= The North Wind, often referred to as Mr. North, is the father of Bigby Wolf. His real name is Boreas Frostheart, as revealed in Fables 110. When traveling the world, he fell in love with a wolf named Winter; they had seven cubs. Mr. North grew bored after several years and abandoned her. He is the only European fable that still holds his kingdom from the Adversary. He arrives in Fabletown when word reaches him about the birth of his grandchildren, and he spends several years at the farm helping Snow take care of them. He treats Snow like she were his own daughter even before she is married to his son, teaching his grandchildren how to fly and shapeshift. He is strong enough to fight Demons and is confident he would be able to beat the D'Jinn, or Genie, that Sinbad's adviser releases, though he tells Snow White and the others the battle would probably destroy most of the planet. He is based on many European wind gods, primarily Boreas (who has his own fable, entitled The North Wind and the Sun). Bigby has never forgiven him for abandoning Winter and considers him a monster. He eventually returns to his kingdom before Bigby returns to Fabletown. Following Bigby and Snow's visit to his castle, he agrees to help Fabletown during the war against the Empire by providing zephyrs trained to act as spies and messengers. It is later revealed that Mr. North and Mr. Dark, although having different purposes, are of similar magic and power (though Mr. Dark claims to be superior). He tried to persuade Mr. Dark to leave the mundane world and the Fables alone - which Dark refused - and offered a challenge of single combat with Frau Totenkinder; it is shown that Mr. North did this in exchange for information from Totenkinder, confirmation that Snow had given birth to a zephyr, Ghost, and that he was living happily as a secret member of the family. Mr. North left, extremely displeased. In Mr. North's kingdom, zephyrs were viewed as predatory monsters. Long ago, following a child massacre at the hands the zephyrs, Mr. North had sworn an oath to his people that as long as he lived, no zephyrs would be allowed to survive. He was now facing a dilemma, as he loved the cubs - his grandchildren - and would never intentionally hurt any of them. Nor did he wish to further exacerbate the slight bond he had managed to form with his son. Desperately trying to find a way to get himself out of the predicament, he realized that the only way he could forsake his vow to kill Ghost was to die, as death canceled all obligations. A grim Mr. North confronted Mister Dark, the Dullahan who had sworn vengeance against the Fables and was out to kill all of them, including Mr. North's family. Knowing that the damages from a battle between the two would be catastrophic for the Fables, Mr. North grabbed Mr. Dark by the throat and brought up him up into the North Wind's own realm of elemental ice and wind, so that even the slightest brush of the Dullahan's death would not touch the world below. There, he entered his Casket of Primordial Winds (a suicide mechanism kept in case he got tired of this life, since nothing much could harm him) and took Mr. Dark with him, killing them both. When informed of Mr. North's death, Bigby felt conflicted, as he had hated his father for so long and now his father had done something so noble as this. His musings were interrupted when one of the North Wind's aides showed up and informed him that now that Mr. North was dead, a new North Wind was needed from his bloodline. Since Bigby is \\"entirely unsuitable\\", they will have to choose from among his children. =The West Wind= Brother/cousin of the North Wind, and great uncle of the \\"cubs\\". The West Wind appears as a Native American, and goes by the name of Yaponcha, the Hopi wind godNevins, Jess, Willingham, Bill, Buckingham, Mark (2013). Fables Encyclopedia. New York. DC Comics. from Native American legends. He is also known as Zephyrus, the Greek god of the west wind. Another reference to Native American mythology is made when he compares wolves (more specifically, Bigby) to the mythological coyote. During the process of choosing the North Wind's heir, the three other cardinal winds arrived, intending to take possession of the ‚Äúcubs‚Äù. They believed that the \\"offspring of one of the great houses\\" should be fostered for a time in the courts of other kings and that the cardinal winds themselves were best suited to determine who might be the most fit to rule Mr. North's kingdom. Bigby, father of the cubs, was furious and would not allow this, and the West Wind then secretly attempted to persuade the East Wind and the South Wind to join him in taking over the North Wind's keep and kill his family, including the children. Thus, they could construct a new north wind from pure materials. However, the South Wind accuses him of wanting to do this out of personal revenge on the North Wind. Both she and the East Wind remind him that he has been on bad terms with the North Wind for some years, even naming the \\"zephyrs\\" after him to insult him. Winter, one of \\"the Cubs\\", was eventually chosen as the new North Wind. When this happened, the West Wind referred to the new situation as \\"a setback\\", but did not interfere. =The East Wind= The North Wind's brother/cousin. The East Wind takes the form of an obese man and goes by the names of Eurus (the name of the Greek deity representing the east wind), Fei Lian (the Chinese god of the wind) and Dragon of the East. He does appear to have some physical traits similar to young Ambrose. Not much is known about him, but unlike the West Wind, he doesn't appear to wish to kill the North Wind's family. And like the South Wind, he believes the West Wind only wants to hurt them out of personal spite. With coaxing from the South Wind, she got them to decide to invite themselves as guests of the Wolf Clan. However, upon hearing the ideas of his fellow winds, the East Wind suggested that they not only killed the entire wolf clan, but the North Wind's attendant winds as well. The others agreed to the plan. However, when Winter (one of the \\"cubs\\") is chosen as the new North Wind, the East Wind appears to accept it, and even tells a disgruntled West Wind to be quiet and mind the occasion. He also wishes to assist in Winter's training. However, Winter becomes soon becomes deathly afraid when she starts having nightmares where she sees a grown-up version of herself as a cold, selfish North Wind that hurts people. The East Wind is very pleased with this new \\"marvelous\\" development in which they will have a \\"timid\\" North Wind, whereas the South Wind, equally pleased, says that their day of ascendancy has come at long last. During \\"Cubs in Toyland\\" arc Bigby asks as humbly as he could for their help in finding Therese and Darien. While of course all the winds at first refuse, Bigby makes a verbal threat that he'd make them pay if they didn't. It is noted, that while he's just as suspicious character as his siblings, he was the only one of them not griping or complaining about searching for them. He notes \\"Sometimes a doing a favor is its own reward\\", meaning he could have some benevolence in him at the most as he saw that while Bigby wasn't a god like them, he wasn't just an ordinary human either. =The South Wind= The North Wind's sister/cousin, and the cubs' great aunt. The South Wind takes the form of an African-looking woman. Even though all the Cardinal Winds have the ability to take the form of both genders, she is the only one of the group who's chosen to take a female form. She goes by the names of Yoruba (after the Yoruba people of West Africa), Notus (the south wind in Greek mythology) and Storm Mother. She could be considered the more compassionate and sensible one of the Winds, although she has been shown to have a more ruthless, cunning side as well. After hearing the West Wind's ideas, the South Wind suggested that they should instead conduct themselves as proper guests until Bigby had another outburst. When that happened, they would be \\"fully justified\\" in stepping in with force. The other winds agreed to the plan, with a few modifications from the East Wind, who suggested that they not only killed the entire wolf clan, but the North Wind's attendant winds as well. The West Wind and the South Wind both agreed. Later, it becomes clear to the winds that the testing might place the children in mortal danger, and the East Wind remarks that if the cubs are killing themselves in the process of testing, the fewer the winds will have to take out when they are compelled to step in. The South Wind reminds the others that their patience is paying off and that they were right to hold off taking a direct hand. One of the \\"cubs\\", Winter, is eventually chosen as the new North Wind. The South Wind watches in silence and appears to accept the new development. However, Winter becomes very afraid when she starts having premonitions of her older self as a cold and selfish North Wind that hurts people. The East Wind refers to the new development as \\"marvelous\\" because the new North Wind will be timid, and the South Wind appears to be very pleased and answers that \\"our day of ascendancy has come at long last\\". However, Winter proved to be stronger than the South Wind expected. In the Camelot story arc, Winter has grown into her role as the new North Wind, and has learned how to utilize her new powers. She has had enough of her guests overstaying their welcome, and banishes the cardinal winds from her palace. Arabian Fables A group of characters living in the Arabian Fable homelands, mostly from One Thousand and One Nights: =Sinbad= Sinbad, the famed mariner of legend, is a prince of the Arabian Fables. He arrived in Fabletown during the Arabian Nights (And Days) story-arc, accompanied by his minister, Yusuf, a host of servants and slaves and, to the consternation of his hosts, a d'jinn secured within a bottle, for a meeting carefully negotiated by Mowgli. Things got off to the worst possible start when Prince Charming forgot completely about the meeting and it was only when King Cole, who both spoke the language and was familiar with the customs, was brought in that things began to calm down. As things progressed, Sinbad began to see that the mundane world represented a new beginning, and decided to free all of his slaves. The enraged Yusuf used this as an excuse to release the d'jinn, giving it commands that would put him in control of both the European and Arabian fable communities. Fortunately, Frau Totenkinder had anticipated the possibility and warped his language, so that the commands he gave were not what he intended, ultimately leading to his own prolonged demise and the recapture of the d'jinn. Sinbad did indeed release his slaves, giving them the option to either accompany him back to Baghdad or to remain in Fabletown. He left Fabletown, taking King Cole with him as the official Ambassador to the Arabian Fables. They returned to Baghdad, where he revealed to Cole that, for the time being, the Arabian Fables still live in the Homelands equivalent of Baghdad, until such time as the Adversary's forces take it. Sinbad has learned from the uncontrolled exodus of the European Fables into the mundane world and has made plans to ensure that their own escape, should it prove necessary, will be much more orderly. During the War and Pieces storyline, Sinbad participated bravely in the war against the Adversary, commanding the skyship Glory of Baghdad, with Prince Charming as his combat coordinator. After the destruction of the ship, he defended the injured Charming while the latter dragged the last bomb to its target and set it off. After the war, he married Rose Red, who divorced him around a week after their wedding to try to be with Boy Blue. Following failed attempt to reconcile, he returned to Baghdad, expressing a wish to build a new airship with which to explore the liberated homelands. =Aladdin= The Arabian Fables' best spy, ostensibly acting under the orders of Sinbad. Aladdin is seen briefly learning English in preparation for the war against the Adversary. He is later seen in Dubai, disguised as a concierge in the Burj al-Arab hotel, holding a knife and preparing to attack an oblivious Cinderella, as seen in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love. Both end up working on the same spy job together, looking for the ones who are selling magical contraband. They eventually discover it is the three girls from Sinbad's harem and find they are in dealing with Cinderella's own Fairy Godmother. Cinderella eventually defeats her grandmother with the help of Hickory and leaves with Aladdin. She reveals she knows about him spying on the other Fable-communities, but states she'll keep quiet because she's attracted to him. Aladdin returns her feelings and they decide to spend a night together. Not living \\"happily ever after\\", but, in Cindy's words, living \\"happily for the moment\\". =Ali Baba= Ali Baba was briefly mentioned during the Arabian Nights (And Days) storyline. He also appears in the first storyline of the Fables spin-off Fairest, where the famous prince of thieves makes his way to the Imperial Capital in the Homelands. The city has recently been burned down by goblins. While looking for treasures hidden among the char and ash, he finds a magic bottle, which he opens, but the bottle does not contain a d'jinn, but a little bottle imp. Although the imp cannot grant him three wishes, it promises to lead him to great riches. The imp leads him to the encampment of the goblins who burned down the city, and where Briar Rose, still asleep, is being held. The imp explains to Ali Baba that the sleeping girl is blessed with eternal wealth and riches, but needs to be woken with true love's kiss from a prince, and that if Ali Baba marries her, he will get everything she gets. Ali Baba sneaks into the camp, and finds both Briar Rose and, Lumi, the Snow Queen, also asleep. Since he doesn't know which woman the imp meant, he first kisses the sleeping Snow Queen. When that doesn't work, he kisses Briar Rose, who awakens from the spell, along with the Snow Queen. The Snow Queen, wanting revenge on Briar Rose for putting her to sleep for years, takes both of them captive, but does not harm them. While Ali Baba and Briar Rose are forced to spend time with Lumi, Ali Baba eventually realizes that he has no feelings for Briar Rose after all, but is in love with Lumi. It is revealed that because Ali Baba risked his life to wake and rescue Briar Rose, his actions fell under the definition of true love, but was not romantic love. Lumi likes and is attracted to Ali Baba, and believes that love can grow from that. The two become a couple, and start a new life together in Lumi's homeland. Unfortunately, this is only temporary, as both of them are killed during the events of the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All The Land at the hands of Golilocks. Cinderella was able to bring Goldilock's victims back to life, but unfortunately, she could only pick half of the victims to resurrect. So she choose Lumi, feeling she was a victim at the hands of the Adversary, and a potential ally for Fabletown. =Other Arabian Fables= *Yusuf: Sinbad's minister who released a d'jinn from a bottle, in order to destroy Fabletown and its citizens and put him in control of both the European and Arabian fable communities. Unfortunately for him, Frau Totenkinder used her magic powers to warp his language, so that the commands he gave were not what he intended, ultimately leading to his own prolonged demise and the recapture of the d'jinn. *Sidi Nouman: The first victim of the d'jinn released by Sinbad's servant, Yusuf, as seen in Arabian Nights (And Days). Appears in the One Thousand and One Night story \\"The Caliph‚Äôs Night Adventure\\" (as Sidi Nu‚Äôuman), which includes the chapter \\"History of Sidi Nu‚Äôuman\\". The d'jinn makes references to the story by calling Sidi Nouman \\"famous abuser of horses\\", \\"celebrated husband of corpse-eaters\\" and \\"a dog who's occasionally a man - or is that the other way around?\\". (Note that the Fables Encyclopedia erroneously states that Sidi Nouman was created by Bill Willingham) *King ShahryƒÅr: In the graphic novel 1001 Nights of Snowfall, Snow White is dispatched to the Arabian sultan's court in the Homelands to enlist his support in the fight against the Adversary. King ShahryƒÅr entraps her, and for a thousand-and-one nights in a row, she must tell ShahryƒÅr a story, each time stopping at dawn with a cliffhanger, thus forcing him to keep her alive for another day so that she can complete the tale the next night, while at the same time wooing his cooperation. *Scheherazade: Makes a brief appearance in 1001 Nights of Snowfall. It is revealed she got the idea of telling the Sultan a new story every night from Snow White, who has been using the same trick herself to keep herself alive for a thousand-and-one nights while acting as an ambassador for Fabletown. *Scheherazade's father: Also makes an appearance in the graphic novel. *Aladdin's father and the d'jinn: From the tale of Aladdin. Mentioned in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love. *Morgiana: Referred to in the Fairest story arc Wide Awake. *Abd Al Qadir: Appears briefly in flashbacks from Ali Baba's life, in the Fairest story arc Wide Awake. A minor character referred to in the One Thousand and One Night story \\"Ala al-Din Abu al- Shamat\\", during the \\"Two Hundred and Fifty-third Night\\" (as Abd al-Kadir). The Blue Fairy The Blue Fairy was the one who turned Pinocchio into a real boy centuries ago. She took his wish too literally and made it so that he would be a real boy, therefore never growing up and experiencing puberty. She lent Geppetto some of her power in order for him to turn more of his puppets into real people, but soon she saw how greedy Geppetto was becoming, and started resisting. This prompted Geppetto to trap the Blue Fairy and use machinery to drain power from her body so he could use her power on his own. Pinocchio stated early on he only went to Remembrance Day celebrations to see when the Blue Fairy would show up, and that he would \\"kick her pretty little azure ass\\" whenever she did. Many years later, in the early period of the power struggle over the Farm, Ozma brought the Blue Fairy to the Farm, obviously wanting revenge on Geppetto for his wicked deeds. The Blue Fairy tried to attack Geppetto, but was interrupted when Pinocchio attempted to beat her up, wanting revenge for being stuck as a boy for centuries. She quickly overpowered him and went after Gepetto, but the Sheriff, Beast, intervened and managed to talk the Blue Fairy into going away for 777 days, at which time she promised to return and expected Beast to have Geppetto ready and waiting to receive her vengeance. If not, she was going to take Beast prisoner for 777 years. Later, Beast is able to stall her by saying that Gepetto wishes to marry her. The Blue Fairy chooses the Lady of the Lake as her intermediary in the wedding negotiations. In the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All The Land, the Blue Fairy and the Lady of the Lake both become victims of a serial killer, who is revealed to be Goldilocks. Cinderella is able to resurrect the victims, but can only bring back half of them, and chooses the Lady of the Lake over the Blue Fairy. The Blue Fairy is cast into what the Magical Mirror calls the \\"stay dead group\\" - meaning even the mirror does not expect her to return to the living (though her severed head can continues to talk). Santa Claus Stationed at the Homelands version of the North Pole, according to Fables 137 (Camelot, Part 6), Santa Claus is a Fable who can magically be at every house in the world at the same time on Christmas night. Following an attempt by Jack Horner to steal the naughty and nice list in 1956, Santa has left the list with Bigby to put in a safe place every year since. He is said to be one of the most powerfully magical of the fables, and plays an important role in beginning Flycatcher's quest to restore his Homelands kingdom. It is also implied by Rose Red that Santa is the guardian of a gateway from the Homelands. Santa has also been revealed to be a Paladin of Hope, specifically the Hope for Justice, and the Hope for Reward as well as the hope that everything will turn out all right in the end, claiming that this is why Christmas takes place at the end of the year. The Camelot story arc reveals that Santa is \\"a creature of the north\\"; a subset of the North Wind, who has always been the North Wind's vassal. Winter, the New North Wind, asks him to expand his primary duties. From now on, Christmas will come to any world where the North Wind resides. *Mrs. Claus *Santa Claus's reindeer, who are intelligent, capable of speech and can magically fly. King Arthur and Camelot King Arthur and his court appears in flashbacks during The Good Prince story arc, where the spirit of Sir Lancelot tells his story to Flycatcher. Camelot and the fabled King Arthur set the standard of \\"true chivalry\\" for all of Christendom and its legend touched much of the pagan worlds beyond. The Fables graphic novel 1001 Nights of Snowfall reveals that Lancelot, Camelot's most gifted champion, was blessed by Frau Totenkinder, who told him that he would be unbeatable in battle as long as he remained pure and honorable. Lancelot was unbeatable, until he lost his honor by having a love affair with the King's wife, Guinevere. The Knights of the Round Table are referred to in Lancelot's story, and Gawain makes an appearance. Lancelot's betrayal, and the \\"unforgivable acts\\" that he perpetrated afterward, split the Round Table and led to the downfall of Camelot. Even though Arthur eventually forgave him, Lancelot couldn't forgive himself. He hanged himself, and became the mysterious Forsworn Knight who appears in the early issues of Fables. Dialog between Flycatcher and Lancelot's ghost reveals that Arthur was eventually laid to rest in a crypt. Arthur appears briefly in flashbacks during the Fables story The Destiny Game. According to the Fables Encyclopedia annotations, \\"Sir Grimauld\\" from The Good Prince is Bill Willingham's creation, as there is no such character in the King Arthur mythos. Based on the color of his armor, he may be the Green Knight from the poem \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" (circa A.D. 1390). King Pellinore makes an appearance in the Fables story The Last Castle, as one of the defenders of the last free gateway. The Lady of the Lake was first referred to in The Good Prince and the Jack of Fables story arc The Bad Prince (in addition, Arthur, Lancelot and Merlin are all referred to in the latter story). She first appears in the story arc The Destiny Game. Also known as the \\"Green Lady\\", she is a messenger of the Fates and has the ability to assign and reassign different destinies to particular individuals. She is a green-skinned woman who sometimes lives in ponds. Initially a sly and conniving woman, she turns more diligently after two encounters with Bigby Wolf. Years later, she is in a well-established relationship with Bigby's cub Ambrose. In later Fables story arcs, Lady of the Lake was shown to be a good friend to the Blue Fairy and came to represent her friend in the engagement to Geppetto. In the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In All the Land, Lady of the Lake and her friend were attacked and apparently murdered at the hands of Goldilocks. Cinderella was able to bring Goldilocks' victims back to life, but was only allowed to choose half of the victims to resurrect, and she chose Lady of the Lake over the Blue Fairy. Merlin appears briefly in flashbacks in the Fables story The Destiny Game. Uther Pendragon, Gorlois and Mordred are mentioned in Fables 136 (Camelot, Part 6). In addition, Arthur's half-sister, Morgan le Fay, is one of the 13th floor witches of Fabletown. Dunster Happ A warlock and former Boxer (hunter of rogue spellcasters and magical beings) for the Empire. Though he did not invent the sealing boxes used by the Boxers to capture their targets, he was able to enchant them so that they would entice their targets to enter them willingly. He had been key to boxing Baba Yaga, Mr. Dark and the last of the Baleful Hernes. Frau Totenkinder (after rejuvenating and using her true name again: Bellflower) asks him to teach her how to box Mr. Dark - despite her initial concerns that such boxes may have been made to capture her as well. During their time, Totenkinder apparently seduced him and became his lover. They would develop a deep relationship and would become engaged. They later came back to The Farm. In the Fairest graphic novel Fairest In all the Land, they were both killed at the hands of the murderous Goldilocks. Cinderella, unfortunately, could only pick half of Goldilocks' victims to resurrect, and ultimately choose Totenkinder over him. King Valemon and his royal subjects Various characters from Norwegian Folktales, as seen in the Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love storyarc. *King Valemon and his queen, rulers of Ultima Thule, one of the Fable Homelands. They were deposed of and killed when an unknown, powerful magic user from another realm invaded their kingdom. The usurper eventually turned out to be Cinderella's fairy godmother. Among the people still loyal to King Valemon include: *Askeladden, now without his ship. *Butterball, always hungry. *Mrs.Gudbrand, widow of the late Gudbrand from Gudbrand on the Hill-side, whose home has become a refuge for dissenters still loyal to the old king. *Little Freddy, from Little Freddy with his Fiddle. Now without his musket. *Little Annie the Goose-Girl. *The ram and pig from The Ram and the Pig Who Went Into the Woods to Live by Themselves. The people of Oz A group of Fables from the books of L. Frank Baum, living in the Fable Homelands of Oz and Ev. (The Nome King is listed under \\"Villains\\".) In addition, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion are prisoners at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village in the mundane world. =Jack Pumpkinhead= Jack Pumpkinhead first appearance was early on in the series, in flashbacks during the Legends in Exile story arc, where he can be seen among a large group of Fables fleeing the Adversary‚Äôs forces. His next appearance took place almost a hundred issues later, in the Fables story The Ascent, where he is on the run from the Nome King‚Äôs (now the ruler of a pan- Ozian empire) enforcers in the Fable Homeland of Ev. It is revealed that he was drafted into one of the Nome King‚Äôs press gangs, but eventually managed to escape with Bungle the glass cat and the Sawhorse. While sitting in one of Ev's native Lunch Box Trees, Bufkin accidentally saves the group from a couple of \\"Rumble Tumble Tom's\\", the Nome King's enforcers. The group joined forces with Bufkin, and went on to appear in the subsequent Fables story arcs, working to overthrow the Nome King. =Bungle, the Glass Cat= At some point, Bungle, the Glass Cat escaped into the mundane world and became one of the helpers of Dorothy Gale, a killer for hire. Bungle was later recruited by Dorothy to aid her in her quest for revenge on her nemesis, Cinderella, as seen in Cinderella: Fables are Forever. Bungle assisted in kidnapping Cinderella and Ivan Durak of Shadow Fabletown and brought them to the Deadly Desert of Oz in an airship. Ivan seemingly manages to overpower their captors and throw Bungle and the other captors out of the ship, rescuing Cindy and himself. Bungle is shown floating down in a parachute, indicating that she's working with Ivan. In a surprising plot twist, it is revealed that Dorothy was Ivan all along, disguising herself using her magic slippers. Bungle's story continues in the Fables series. After Bungle landed, she was drafted into one of the Nome King's press gangs, building a road across the deadly desert. She managed to escape with Jack Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse, also in the press gang. Bufkin came across the group in the Land of Ev, and accidentally saved them from the Nome King's enforcers, who were chasing the fugitives. All four of them then secretly formed a secret resistance movement. =Other Oz- characters= *Glinda the Good: Shown driving her swan chariot during flashbacks in Legends in Exile, while fleeing the Adversary's forces (note that annotations in the Fables Encyclopedia speculate that this may be Apollo, but the figure is clearly a woman). She also appears briefly in flashbacks from Dorothy Gale's adventures in Oz, in Cinderella: Fables Are Forever. *The Sawhorse: One of several Oz-fable who's ended up in the Fable Homeland of Ev while on the run from the Nome King's enforcers. He joins Bufkin's revolution. *The Spoon Brigade: From The Emerald City of Oz: recruited by Dorothy to aid her in her plot for revenge on her nemesis, Cinderella. *One of the Chiss: Also recruited by Dorothy. They are creatures the size of a Volkswagen, covered in poisonous quills which they can shoot out of their body at will. They can only be found in Oz. Dorothy brought one of the Chiss to the mundane world to aid her in her quest for revenge on Cinderella. When Cindy set out find Dorothy, she encountered the creature in Thailand. The creature killed Meng Chiang-Nu (from the Chinese folktale Seeking Her Husband at the Great Wall) of Shadow Fabletown, and then attacked Cinderella, who was forced to kill the creature in self-defense. *The Wicked Witch of the East, assorted munchkins, the Wizard of Oz, the Wicked Witch of the West and the Good Witch of the North: They appear briefly in flashbacks from Dorothy's adventures in Oz. In addition, several allusions to the Wicked Witch of the West are made in the Witches story arc. *Winged monkeys: All working in the Nome King's air corps. One of the monkeys discovers Bufkin's group of revolutionaries in Ev, and is subsequently killed by Bufkin. *The Yoop: From The Patchwork Girl of Oz. Now working in the Pan-Ozian administration of the Nome King, who feeds his enemies to the Yoop. The Yoop eventually got tired of his job as the Nome King's \\"people eater\\", feeling that he could not keep up with the large number of people being fed to him every day. He was sent out to capture Bufkin, Jack Pumpkinhead, Bungle the Glass Cat and the Sawhorse, but decided to join their revolution instead. *A group of Kalidahs: Also working for the Nome King. They joined Bufkin's revolution because they were tired of being made to sleep in filthy cages when off-duty. *General Blug, with his fifty thousand soldiers: From The Emerald City of Oz. Jack Pumpkinhead, Bungle the Glass Cat and the Sawhorse attempt to recruit Blug and his troops in their revolution. Other Homelands Fables *The Jabberwock: Mentioned in the Legends in Exile and Homelands story arcs. Just like in the Jabberwocky poem, the vorpal sword was the Jabberwock's bane. *Don Quijote and his squire Sancho Panza: Appear briefly in flashbacks during the Legends in Exile story arc. *The Great Lion: According to the Fables Encyclopedia annotations, this is a reference to Aslan from The Chronicles of Narnia. The Kingdom of the Great Lion was one of the Fable Homelands that was conquered early on, as seen in flashbacks during Legends in Exile. The lion himself was felled and killed by arrows. King Cole points out that \\"we always found the old lion to be a bit too pompous and holier-than-thou for our tastes\\". The Great Lion also appears in an illustration for The Good Prince, where the ghost of Sir Lancelot refers to the lion as \\"the Great Lion on his stone\\" (Aslan sacrificed himself and was killed on a stone table) and one of the \\"true kings\\". Bill Willingham has commented on the issue, saying: \\"Narnia is my favorite fantasy series, bar none. (...) Problem is, Narnia isn't in the public domain, so we couldn't use it in Fables. So who is the lion mentioned in that one panel [in Legends in Exile] and what kingdom is depicted? I can't say it's Aslan and I can't say it's Narnia. But that doesn't stop any of you from looking at the first lines of this paragraph and coming to your own conclusion.\\" *Thumbelina's mother: Referred to in the Fables story Barleycorn Brides. *Count Aucassin de Beaucaire: From Aucassin and Nicolette. A general leading the Adversary's attack on the Last Free Gateway from the Homelands, as seen in The Last Castle.

According to annotations in the Fables Encyclopedia, she is the woman by Robin Hood's side in flashbacks during the Legends in Exile story arc. *The Queen of Fairies: Also mentioned in The Last Castle. Apparently, Tam Lin, one of the defenders of the last free gateway, was loved by her. *Jack's mother: From Jack and the Beanstalk. Mentioned in the March of the Wooden Soldiers story arc, the Jack of Fables story arc The Bad Prince and in The Great Fable Crossover. In The Bad Prince, it is revealed that Jack Horner is actually an unknowing copy of Wicked John and that John was actually the one involved in the Beanstalk and Giant-killing incidents, thus making the woman the mother of Wicked John, not Jack.

When Blue points out that the cat isn't dead but merely sleeping, the mice reply that \\"nevertheless, we have our plans\\". *The Three Knights of the Rus: Baba Yaga's servants. They appear in the fairy tale \\"Vasilisa the Beautiful\\", from Alexander Afanasyev's Narodnye russkie skazki.

This would turn out not to be the case and John's King was now actually working for the Adversary. The King contacted John and ordered him to spy on his fellow Fables. John was bound by his vow, which overruled the later compact, and had no choice but to obey and spent four years passing information to the enemy before Kay caught him. *Solomon: Referred to as Sulymon the Wize in the comic.

He works with Mr. Porky Pine and Chicken Ripple to steal unguarded pies being put out on a windowsill (or other places) to cool.

Mr. Porky Pine once convinced a human girl to give him a big kiss, claiming he was an enchanted prince. After the girl ran away with both hands stuck by needles, he explained to the Gingerbread Man and Chicken Ripple that he was actually cursed by a witch, only the curse was, in his own words, a perverse attraction to human women. In the Fables story In Those Days, it is revealed that the porcupine was cursed by a young Frau Totenkinder: Mr. Porky Pine angered Totenkinder by calling human women ugly, and she threw a curse on him that made him desire only human women. *Radiskop: The Fables version of Ratatoskr, the squirrel from Norse mythology who lives on Yggdrasil, the tree that spans the world.

It is revealed that it was Cinderella's fairy godmother who showed him the way to Rapunzel's tower. Rapunzel and the Prince shared a passionate love affair, which resulted in Rapunzel becoming pregnant. She then spent months trying to find him, but unbeknownst to her, the fairy godmother now forbade the prince to contact Rapunzel, as the godmother had \\"plans for\\" her. *Baleful Hernes: Apparently a reference to the Wild Hunt. The last of their kind (presumably Herne the Hunter) was boxed offscreen by Dunster Happ during his \\"Boxing Days\\". *Kermit the Frog (maybe): Either he is a cheerleader/mascot who does not need a costume, or an actor is impersonating him, during the Frog Prince's baseball matches in Haven, as seen in the story Out to the Ball Game. *The Scorpion and the Frog: One of the Scorpion's brothers, Ollikandar Strikeswift, appears in the story Out to the Ball Game, and both the Frog and the Scorpion, Gallifar Strikeswift, are mentioned. The brother's testimony plays a pivotal role when a murderer is trialled in Haven, in front of Flycatcher. It was unclear if the Scorpion's existence was genuine fact or pure myth - even within the Fables themselves (besides, the original tale itself was subject to ambiguity, as it is usually wrongly attributed to Aesop). *In the Rose Red story arc, several characters from the fairy tale Snow White and Rose Red appear in flashbacks from Snow White's and Rose Red's childhood: **The girls' mother: A poor widow who is secretly a witch **The wicked dwarf: The father of The Seven Dwarfs **The eagle: After the girls save the dwarf from the eagle, the eagle is angry and says that for one of them, seven evils await, for the other, the loss of one dear **Brandish, the bewitched prince (described in the \\"villains\\" section) **Holben, the prince's brother: Unlike in the fairy tale, the prince does not marry the Snow, nor does his brother marry Rose; Holben makes it clear that he has no wish to marry Rose Red, and their father, the king, is against letting Brandish marry a common peasant girl. *The Evil Queen: Mentioned in Storybook Love and appears in flashbacks in the Rose Red and Camelot story arcs. The queen is actually Snow White's and Rose Red's aunt, and sister of their mother (from the fairy tale Snow White and Rose Red). She is the widowed queen of a distant land, a position that her sister, secretly a witch, helped her achieve. When Snow's mother is forced to send Snow away, she arranges for her daughter to live with her aunt. Years pass, until the queen is one day told by the magical mirror that Snow is lovelier than her. Even though the queen promised her sister that she would love Snow dearly, the queen orders a hunter to kill her adopted daughter. The hunter spares her and Snow flees into the forest. The Queen eventually discovers that Snow White is alive by consulting the magic mirror. Cloaking herself in the guise of an old woman, she visits the cottage of the seven dwarfs and gives her a poisoned apple. Snow eats the apple and falls into a deep coma, but Prince Charming's love is enough to overcome the poison, since all nobles of that world had some degree of magic in them. *The World Turtle: Once the queen of a great kingdom in the Fable Homelands. When the king discovered that she was being unfaithful, he punished her by turning her into a turtle. He transformed her soul into a teacup of delicate ceramic, which she had to carry on her back. The cup contained her entire homeland, an archipelago of \\"surging seas and sun-dappled islands\\", and all of its people. If she let the teacup fall or break, her people and her homeland would be destroyed, and her soul would be lost to her forever. Her horrible trial would end when she found a heroine of low station willing to trade places with her. The heroine would then become the new queen, and the turtle a new peasant. Once, the turtle passed through the woods where a young Rose Red, now without her sister, lived, but the turtle understood quickly that Rose Red, sad and depressed, was not the one she was looking for. The turtle once crossed paths with Bigby Wolf, and was the one who told him about the Lady of the Lake and her powers to assign fates. *Aunt Em: Dorothy Gale mentions her in Cinderella: Fables Are Forever, saying her aunt always said \\"you should find something you love to do and then do it\\". Dorothy, having killed two witches and liking it, was inspired to become a killer for hire. *Prince Lindworm: Was beheaded by the Imperial General Mirant when Lindworm attempted to make himself the new Emperor in the wake of the defeat of the Adversary. He came back to life when his head was reunited with his body by his loyal goblin troops. *Coyote: This mythological character is mentioned by the West Wind in the story arc Inherit the Wind, in which he (Coyote) is described as \\"cunning\\". *The Little Match Girl: One of Hope's paladins and the caretaker of Hope Deferred. Rose Red meets the little girl on Christmas Eve in the Fables story \\"All in a Single Night\\", where Rose is taken \\"worlds away\\", in a Fables takes on A Christmas Carol. The Little Match Girl is still making a living selling matches. Rose asks her to get out of the cold, or else she'll die. The girl answers that she has no home and many matchstick bundles yet to sell. Rose says to her that she will die tonight, as in the fairy tale, but the girl answers that no one knows what will be and that she is young and can stand the cold. She speaks of her hopes for the future, and hopes that her (future) children will have a better life than her. Rose is heartbroken, because she knows that the girl will freeze to death, with all her hopes unfulfilled. *The false bride from the fairy tale The Goose Girl: Another one of Hope's paladins and the avatar for the Hope of Revenge. She wanders at the edge of the living world, night after night, never to know rest. She explains to Rose Red that \\"all those good men and women\\" had their revenge on her; for her crimes, they locked her in a barrel, pounded iron spikes though it and sent her tumbling down the cobbles to her death. The people who sentenced her to death are lying in their graves, but each Christmas Eve, they are freed from their resting places and allowed to walk about as ghosts. They all hope to be released from their confinement and pass on to \\"rewards long delayed\\", but the false bride tells Rose that they hope in vain, because \\"they attend me and I'll never dismiss them\\".

These are the inmates at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village. Little Black Sambo (\\"Sam\\") Mr. Revise did such a good job of revising Little Black Sambo's story that Sam has grown into an old man and few people remember him. He still managed to escape during the mass breakout from the Golden Boughs by turning all of Robin Page‚Äôs tigers into butter. This upset Mister Revise greatly, as he viewed Sam as one of his greatest successes. According to Revise, Sam's story was \\"censored, shunned and forgotten by the oversensitive mundys\\". In The Great Fables Crossover, Kevin Thorn summoned Sam along with Hansel, hoping they could inspire him in writing his masterpiece. After numerous disagreements, Sam eventually dumped Hansel out of his wheelchair and off a cliff. He then attempted, unsuccessfully, to put an end to Thorn's plans by stealing his magical pen. During the final Jack of Fables story arc, it is revealed that he has become a father to a little baby boy, Sammy Junior, as a result of a one-night stand with Robin Page. Sam is one of the few regular characters who survives the Jack of Fables' final issue. The Tin Man The Tin Man was first seen in flashbacks during the Fables: Legends in Exile story arc, while fleeing the Adversary's forces. In the Fables spin-off Cinderella: Fables Are Forever, it is revealed that he, along with the Cowardly Lion, Dorothy Gale and Toto made it into the mundy world in the year of 1943, having been on the run from the Adversary's forces for years. The Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion decided to live out on the Jersey pine barrens rather than staying at the Farm, while Dorothy went on to live as a killer for hire among the mundys. At some point years later, all of them were captured by Mr. Revise's people and imprisoned at the Golden Boughs. The Tin Man used to have all sorts of appendages attached to his body, including tin cannons, a rotating saw and a large drill, which were all removed when he was revised. When Bookburner attacked the Golden Boughs, Mr. Revise reluctantly allowed many of the revised Fables to be restored back to their original self, and the Tin Man magically got all of the appendages back. In the final issue of Jack of Fables, the Tin Man and many former prisoners are caught in the middle of a confrontation between Jack Frost Two and Jack Horner, who has been turned into a dragon. Jack Frost believes that the Tin Man is on the dragon's side and kills him by chopping off his head. The Cowardly Lion Like several other Oz-characters, the Cowardly Lion was first seen in flashbacks during the Fables: Legends in Exile story arc, while fleeing the Adversary's forces. In the Fables spin-off Cinderella: Fables Are Forever, it is revealed the Lion, along with the Tin Man, Dorothy Gale and Toto, was on the run from the Adversary's forces for years, before the group made it into the mundy world in the year of 1943. The Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man decided to live out on the Jersey pine barrens rather than staying at the Farm, while Dorothy went on to live as a killer for hire among the mundys. At some point years later, all of them were captured by Mr. Revise's people and imprisoned at the Golden Boughs. When Mr. Revise reluctantly allowed the revised Fables to be restored back to their original self, and the Cowardly Lion learns that he was actually vicious lion looking for restraint before he was revised. In the series' final issue, in a chaotic battle with Jack Horner, who has been transformed into a dragon, the Lion dies when he is caught in Jack's dragon fire. Humpty Dumpty Humpty Dumpty, also known as Mister D, is a giant egg who can blast away like a cannon, who fought in the Homelands version of the Battle of Colchester. This is a reference to the history of the nursery rhyme; \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was originally the name of a big cannon used during this battle.Nevins, Jess, Willingham, Bill, Buckingham, Mark (2013). Fables Encyclopedia. New York. DC Comics. Humpty attempted to escape the Golden Boughs again and again until he finally succeeded during the mass breakout orchestrated by Jack; only to get himself shattered when blasting several of Robin Page‚Äôs tigers. Since Humpty had promised to lead Jack to a hidden treasure, Jack took the Humpty Dumpty parts with him, and did the impossible by putting Humpty Dumpty back together again, using copious amounts of super glue. They found the treasure eventually, but Humpty was captured by Bookburner and forced to join him in his march against the Golden Boughs. After he got himself broken again, Bookburner had him resurrected as an evil version of his former self. Apparently, Humpty recovered, and was back as his old self again in the final Jack of Fables story arc. He was killed when Hillary Page fired her rifle- mounted grenade launcher in a chaotic fight in the final issue of Jack of Fables. Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox Paul Bunyan used to travel the length and breadth of his Fable Homeland of Americana, with his trusty blue ox at his side. He has been shrunk down to a smaller version of himself by Mr. Revise, but still grows in size when he is angry or when he gets closer to Americana. When Hillary Page cooked up a plan to venture in Americana, she blackmailed Bunyan to go with her, and both were captured by Bookburner when they reached their destination. Bookburner killed Bunyan by burning Bunyan's book and had him resurrected as one of his loyal soldiers, resulting in Bunyan's ox was left on its own. Bunyan was seemingly killed when Gary the Pathetic Fallacy unleashed his powers on him when Bookburner's army attacked the Golden Boughs. Babe the Blue Ox was transformed into a miniature ox by Mr. Revise; after Babe and Bunyan were caught trying to escape the Golden Boughs during the mass escape orchestrated by Jack Horner, Revise had them both thrown down the \\"memory hole\\" as punishment, resulting in the already shrunken Bunyan becoming almost human-sized and Babe turning into a miniature blue ox. Throughout the series, Babe enjoys entertaining the reader with his own private musings. Babe seems to be one of the few characters that breaks the fourth wall, but it is unclear who he talks to exactly (himself, the reader or an imaginary audience). He also seems to be able to find himself in the most improbable situations, without anyone showing any sign of surprise (some characters even mistake him for a dog, though he clearly looks like what he is: a blue ox). Even Bunyan seems a little confused about Babe's identity, as he keeps referring to Babe as a \\"she\\", even though he also refers to Babe as an ox and is deeply insulted when someone calls Babe a cow. Babe is somewhat loyal to Jack, but he is also somewhat delusional in his mind as he likes to talk in his mind about stories he makes up. Babe is also one of the very few characters to have survived in the final Jack of Fables story arc. Wicked John A man who is the spitting image of Jack Horner, except from the dark hair. He used to be best friends with Raven and is shown several times trying to get Alice's attentions, though she's clearly disgusted by him. It is revealed that Jack Horner was never involved in the Beanstalk or Giant-killing incidents, but is actually an unknowing copy of Wicked John. Upon Wicked John's death, some great power decided to write him back into the stories, but got his name wrong, thus creating Jack Horner. John was later revived, and now both Fables exist. Gary the Pathetic Fallacy informs Jack of the facts after a mysterious, old man shows up and plunges the sword Excalibur through Jack's chest (and dies shortly thereafter). Jack, who can't get the sword out, is delighted with the news, since this means that the sword was really meant for John, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù version. Jack is able to pull Excalibur out of his chest and impales John with it, before leaving John behind. In the final story arc of the series, it is shown that John has been at the Grand Canyon, the place where he was left behind, for at least two decades, still living with the sword stuck in his chest. He is now being used as a tourist attraction as the \\"Impaled Wild Man\\". It appears no one's really tried making real interaction with him, beyond trying to pull out his sword for fun. Due to this treatment, he has lost some of his mental stability and has become somewhat delusional. Eventually, he has enough of being an attraction and makes a long journey to find Gary the Pathetic Fallacy. He does eventually find Jack, who has been transformed into a dragon, and Gary. At the same time, Jack Frost Two arrives to slay the dragon Jack, not knowing that the dragon is his father. Gary, rushing to Jack's defense, pulls the sword right out of John in order to defend Jack, and Wicked John dies from the injuries. Raven Raven is a Native American who can turn into a raven and is guided by a bird spirit. He is referred to as a trickster figure, which is true to the mythology. During his time as a prisoner at the Golden Boughs, the spirit instructed him to stay close to the copy of Jack of the Tales. Raven, like so many others, believed that Wicked John, who was the spitting image of Jack except from his dark hair, was a copy of Jack Horner, and Raven and John became close friends. After the mass escape from the Golden Boughs, it was revealed that John was the original Jack of the Tales and that Jack was actually the copy. After hearing the news, Raven chose to leave John behind and become Jack's companion instead, since the spirit had specifically instructed him to befriend the copy and not the original. Staying true to the trickster figure mythology, he was close to turning his back on Jack more than once when trouble arose, but the bird spirit convinced him otherwise, reminding him that he was supposed to help Jack. Jack and Raven's ways eventually parted after the destruction of the Golden Boughs, when Raven chose to stay with a group of former prisoners. Decades later, in the final story arc of the series, the spirit comes to Raven in a dream and tells him that he has forgotten his purpose in life, which is to protect Jack Horner. The spirit commands him to gather together every ally he can muster and save Jack Horner, who, unbeknown to Raven, has been transformed into a dragon. Raven tells the others that the bird spirit has shown him the way to Fabletown, and the group sets off to find the place. The group follows the spirit for days, until they reach their destination, finding themselves in the middle of a battle between Jack Frost Two and Jack the dragon. Raven lies to the others and convinces them to protect the dragon, saying the dragon is the only one who knows the secret way to Fabletown. Everyone soon realizes that they have been tricked when Jacks kills several of them, believing that they are out to steal his treasure. The Page Sisters also show up, and are devastated when Jack burns the books of original Fable stories that they have been looking for. Upset at the loss of the books (the sisters needed them for restoring their immortality), they start shooting everyone around them and Raven is shot through the head and his chest. As he dies, he asks the spirit why it led them into this death trap, to which the spirit replies, \\"No particular reason. I thought it'd be funny\\" (though it realized some other being had been pulling its strings, as well). Alice Alice spent much of her time inside the Golden Boughs fending off the advances of Wicked John, a man she openly despised. She managed to escape with John Henry and Pecos Bill during the big breakout, and the group briefly accompanied with Jack Horner, who told them the story behind his identity as Jack Frost. Jack made a joking pass on her, but Alice rejected him. She was last seen in the Golden Boughs during Bookburner's attack, where Mr. Revise gives her a copy of her original story, an act that is supposed to grant powers back to the character that had been stripped away. However, whatever abilities Alice had returned to her were never shown. Alice was not seen among the Fables who left the Golden Boughs together after its destruction, and she was not present during the series' finale, indicating that she may be one of the few who survived the series. In the series' final story arc, the Page Sisters come across several books of the original Fable stories (from before they were revised by Mr. Revise), one of which is called \\"Alice's Adventures Beyond the Grave\\" (this may or may not indicate that she might be able to return to the living, even though she may or may not have been killed like almost every one in the \\"Jack Of Fables\\" series). In the Jack of Fables series, Alice is wearing her classic knee-length dress with a white pinafore, but the dress is red rather than blue. Like in the drawings of John Tenniel, her hair is blond. In the story Jack Frost, she also is seen wearing the striped stockings and wide ribbon from the illustrations of Through the Looking-Glass. Toto The Fables spin-off Cinderella: Fables Are Forever tells the story of how Toto, along with Dorothy Gale, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion, escaped to the mundy world during the 1940s. While the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion decided to live out in the woods rather than at the Farm, Dorothy took Toto with her when she left to live as a killer for hire among the mundys. At some point, Toto was captured by Revise's people, presumably when Dorothy was captured in the year of 1986. Toto attempted to flee the Golden Boughs during the mass escape orchestrated by Jack Horner, but was killed and eaten by one of Robin Page's tigers. Dorothy remarks that she's kind of relieved, since this is the first time \\"that flea-bitten mongrel has quit yapping in a hundred years\\". But, as Priscilla Page points out, \\"killed Fables often get magically replaced by new versions of the same Fables\\", and a new version of Toto shows up, alive and well, by Dorothy's side in Oz in Cinderella: Fables Are Forever. It is unknown what became of him after Cinderella kills Dorothy in the Deadly Desert. Lady Luck A blonde who feeds on people's luck by eating their brain. She fled the Fable homeland Americana in order to escape Bookburner, and settled in Las Vegas in the mundane world. In Vegas, she had lucky casino winners kidnapped so that she could use them for her grisly rituals. She left a string of bodies in her wake, but was eventually captured by Revise's people and taken to the Golden Boughs. Lady Luck was one of Goldilocks‚Äô revolutionaries, who believed Bookburner and his army was coming to save them from their captivity at Golden Boughs. Ironically, it was Bookburner's army that shot the revolutionaries down when they finally did arrive. Apparently, she survived, as she cropped up in the final Jack of Fables story arc. She was shot and killed by the Page sisters in a chaotic battle in the final issue of Jack of Fables. She remarked that it was \\"not [her] lucky day\\". Other inmates *The Walrus and the Carpenter. Both were killed in the chaotic fight at the end of the Jack of Fables series; the Carpenter is killed by Jack Horner, who has been transformed into a dragon, and the Walrus dies when a van falls on top of him. *The little oysters from The Walrus and the Carpenter, who apparently were not eaten after all. The oysters were killed in the chaotic battle in the series' finale; some were stepped on by Jack Frost Two, and the others were shot down by the Page Sisters. *Daisy-Head Mayzie, first seen when Sam shows Jack up to his cottage. She is also seen among the escaping Fables during the mass escape from the Golden Boughs. *The Black Sheep and boy from Baa Baa Black Sheep *Little Tommy Tucker, seen when Sam shows Jack up to his cottage and as one of the Fables escaping during the mass breakout orchestrated by Jack Horner. *The Cat and the Fiddle. The only character from Hey Diddle Diddle who does not live at the Farm. *The cat with bagpipes, the mouse and the bumblebee from the nursery rhyme A Cat Came Fiddling out of a Barn.Iona and Peter Opie (editor), The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, Oxford University Press, New edition, 1997, , p. 80 The trio can be seen when Sam shows Jack up to his cottage and is later among the Fables escaping during the mass breakout from the Golden Boughs. *Black Caroline, from Edmund Dulac's story White Caroline and Black Caroline, in Edmund Dulac's Fairy Book. The cottage that Jack moves into is referred to as \\"Black Caroline's old place\\". *Goldilocks *The family and some of the cats from the poem As I Was Going to St Ives. When the cats escape from the sacks, Gary the Pathetic Fallacy animates the sacks to go catch the cats again. A few of the members of the family can be seen escaping the Golden Boughs during the mass breakout. *Revised versions of the Tortoise and the Hare, who still like to race, although the Hare usually wins. Another version of the duo exists at the Farm; Jack claims that they are Mr. Revise's spies and that the Golden Boughs duo is the real one. It is unknown whether he is telling the truth or not. The Tortoise is apparently killed when he is run over by a truck in the series' final issue. Ironically enough, by a truck titled \\"Lepus\\", which is the scientific word for hare. *Kiviuq and his Polar Bear. Kiviuq, once a fearless warrior and, in his own words, ‚Äúa trickster greater than any the world has ever known‚Äù. Reduced to a shadow of his former self after his story was revised, but was eventually restored back to his original self (and got his polar bear back) along with several other Fables. After the destruction of the Golden Boughs, Kiviq and Cuchulainn set out on a quest to find Fabletown; it is unknown if they succeeded. *Revised versions of the Butcher, the Baker and the Candlestick-Maker. Another version of the trio lives in Fabletown; Jack claims that they are Mr. Revise's spies and that the Golden Boughs trio is the real one. It is unknown whether he is telling the truth or not. They were killed by Jack Horner the dragon at the end of the series. *Mother Goose, now a real goose, due to the mundys confusing her name. She speaks only in rhymes. She is yet another inmate killed in the series' finale, when a van lands on top of her. *Cuchulainn, who lost most of his strength after being revised. When Mr. Revise allowed Cuchulainn's original story to be restored, the spear of Morrigan magically appeared back in his hand. After the destruction of the Golden Boughs, Cuchulainn and Kiviuq set out on a quest to find Fabletown; whether they did succeed remains unknown. *The Caterpillar (maybe); a violet/pink caterpillar, which may or may not be The Caterpillar, is shown eating a leaf while Humpty Dumpty tries to convince Jack to let him escape with the others. *Mustardseed, Cobweb, Peaseblossom and Moth from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Jack became their great hero after he, inadvertently, saved them from a boggart back in the Homelands. They assisted Jack in the mass breakout from the Golden Boughs. *Lola and Doris the Cottingley fairies, a lesbian couple who also assisted in the escape. *The Tooth fairy, who likes to horde teeth and has a morbid fascination with the process of losing them. She even sleeps on a bed of teeth. *Dorothy Gale *The Scarecrow, previously seen in flashbacks during the Fables: Legends in Exile story arc, while fleeing the Adversary's forces with the Tin Man and several other Oz-characters. *Assorted Munchkins *John Henry, who managed to escape with Alice and Pecos Bill during the big breakout from the Golden Boughs. The group briefly accompanied Jack Horner, who entertained them with the story behind his identity as Jack Frost. *Pecos Bill. His wife, Slue-Foot Sue, is one of Bookburner‚Äôs people. Bill escaped with Alice and John Henry during the big breakout from the Golden Boughs. The group briefly accompanied Jack Horner, who told them his story behind his identity as Jack Frost. He is present in the series' end battle, and is presumably killed off-screen. *The Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse. They joined Goldilocks‚Äô attempted revolution when Bookburner marched against the Golden Boughs. They changed their mind when Bookburner's army started shooting the revolutionaries down, and decided to make a run for it instead. The Mad Hatter and the March Hare are killed by Jack the dragon in the series' final battle. The Dormouse is not present, and his fate is unknown. *Carl the fourth of the \\"Three Little Pigs\\", who made a house out of cloth. He was Snow White's \\"favorite of The Four Little Pigs\\", prior to being eliminated from the story by Mr. Revise before he could find out what happened to his brothers - temporarily making Colin Snow White's \\"favorite of The Three Little Pigs\\". He is shot and killed by the Page sisters in the series' chaotic end battle. *Wy'east, Klickawit and Loo-Wit: Native American mountain spirits imprisoned in a hidden cave deep beneath the Golden Boughs, as a sort of self-destruct mechanism. After the Bookburner's strike on the Golden Boughs, Jack, his fellow Fables, the Literals and the librarians were forced to release the spirits, who unleashed a roaring volcano upon escape, marking the end of the Golden Boughs Retirement Village. *Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, seen in The Great Fables Crossover References Fables characters, List of Characters Category:Characters created by Bill Willingham ","title":"List of Fables characters (Inmates at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village)"},{"id":"41621736","text":"Satyrium latior is a butterfly of the subfamily Lycaeninae.

He was Lord Mayor of London in 1731. Early ife Child was the son of Sir Francis Child. He was born probably in 1684, as the record of his admission to the freedom of the city of London is dated 12 March 1705. On the death of his elder brother Sir Robert Child in 1721, Child became the head of the banking firm, which was then carried on under the style of Francis Child & Co. He was also elected on 10 October in the same year to succeed his brother and father as alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without, and the following year he became Sheriff of London, with Alderman Humphrey Parsons as his colleague. Career In 1722, Child served the office of master of the Goldsmiths' Company, and was returned Member of Parliament for City of London at the 1722 general election. At the 1727 general election, he was elected one of the MPs for Middlesex, and was also returned at the succeeding general election of 1734. Child purchased in 1726 an estate at Northall for ¬£19,501, which now forms part of the Osterley estate. From 1727 to 1740, he was president of Christ's Hospital, and his portrait is preserved in the board-room of that institution; another portrait, painted in his robes as lord mayor, is to be found at Osterley Park. In 1729 Child introduced a new form of promissory note, with a picture of Temple Bar in the left-hand corner. These were worded very similarly to the Bank of England notes of the present day, and were discontinued, as Mr. F. G. H. Price considers, before 1800. Child became Lord Mayor in 1731, and appointed as his chaplain Dr. John Middleton, rector of St. Peter's, Cornhill. Towards the close of his mayoralty, on 28 September in the following year, he attended with the court of aldermen, sheriffs, and other officials to congratulate George II on his safe return from Hanover. On this occasion the king conferred the honour of knighthood upon the lord mayor, Alderman John Barnard, and Alderman Henry Hankey, one of the sheriffs; addresses to the king and queen were read by Mr. Baron Thompson, the recorder, and their majesties returned gracious answers. Child was elected a director of the East India Company in the year of his mayoralty, and was reelected in 1732. Death and legacy Child died on 20 April 1740, and was buried at Fulham on 28 April.

These are the characters who do not belong in any other category. FlycatcherHope Hope is one of the great powers, belonging to the same group as Mr. Dark and The North Wind. Just like others of her kind, she has her own personal magic box artifact, her Pandoran jar. The character, who is from the story of Pandora and Pandora's box, has appeared in several stories; she is the mysterious being who serves as an adviser to Snow White and Rose Red, taking the form of Colin Pig, Boy Blue and Snow and Rose's mother (from Snow White and Rose Red). Her true form is first seen, briefly, in an illustration for the Rose Red story arc, when Dunster Happ explains about the great powers. Earlier in the same story arc, Rose asks the spirit to show her true form, which it does, but the reader doesn't get to see what Rose sees. Hope's identity as the spirit is revealed in the final issue of the Super Team story arc, where she explains to Rose Red that hope is neither destiny nor strategy, but that she tries to champion those who can direct their hopes into actions. Hope has several paladins working for her, including Santa Claus, The Little Match Girl, and the false bride from the fairy tale The Goose Girl. The Devil(s) A group of Devils that Jack Horner made a deal with to prolong his life in the Jack of Fables story \\"Jack o' Lantern\\". According to the final issue of Jack of Fables, they are all The Devil. *Old Nick: An old hermit living in a swamp, Jack first ran into him during the American Civil War, where Jack beat him in a game of cards, as seen in the Fables story Bag 'O Bones. *Old Scratch: A man with pointy ears who wears a carnival-like red suit. He is the same Devil as in the legend of Stingy Jack. *Pan: One of the gods of Ancient Greece, whose appearance led some Westerners to identify him with the Devil. He claims that he is the real Devil and that Old Scratch is \\"just an uncredentialed upstart in a badly stitched suit\\". *Lucifer: The banished angel who became the Devil. He is described by Jack as being \\"poncy\\". *Chernobog: The devil from Modest Mussorgsky's composition Night on Bald Mountain. His home, Bald Mountain, is identified as a place in the Fable Homelands. Chernobog is eager to show off his nature as an embodiment of evil. Red Riding Hood Red Riding Hood was one of the many Fables unable to escape the Homeland when the Adversary invaded. However, unlike many of the Empire's subjects, she appears to have been spared of any violence and was allowed to live quietly in her cottage, where she would often remain undisturbed for long periods. Her peaceful life was occasionally disrupted by summons to the Warlock's Hall, where, unbeknownst to her, magical fetches of her were created, allowing another to take her form in order to infiltrate groups that were against the Adversary. An unnamed sorceress used her form to infiltrate the citadel at World's End during the Fables last stand in the Homelands, and during her stay she became romantically involved with Boy Blue. The sorceress's eventual fate is unknown. More recently, Baba Yaga used her form to infiltrate Fabletown in preparation for an invasion by the Adversary's Wooden Soldiers. Shortly after the incident, Boy Blue went on a covert mission in the Homelands, which eventually resulted in him finding the real Red Riding Hood. Despite her not being the version of Riding Hood that he had fallen in love with, Boy Blue brought her back to Fabletown in order to protect her from the Adversary's possible wrath. However, upon arriving in the Mundane world, Red Riding Hood was meant with considerable animosity from the other Fables and was treated with undue hostility, due to Baba Yaga's previous assault on Fabletown. Upset by her cold reception and confused by the conventions of the modern world, Red latched onto Boy Blue for support, up until Blue was forced to leave for the Farm to serve his sentence there. She subsequently became close to Flycatcher, who was asked by Boy Blue to look after her while he was gone. She soon fell in love with him for his kind heart and thoughtful nature, though she had trouble expressing her love for him, and was often jealous when she thought pretty Fables were flirting with him. Red attended Bigby and Snow's wedding with Flycatcher, but she failed to recognize Bigby as her old foe, though she did admit that he looked oddly familiar. After returning, she ventured out into the mundane city to get a makeover, hoping to attract the attention of Fly. Her plan backfired when Flycatcher, shocked by her new appearance and intimidated by his attraction for her, ran away and reverted back to his frog form. After Ambrose's humanity and memories were restored by Santa and the spirit of his deceased wife, he fell into a severe depression. At first, Riding Hood tried to be understanding of Flycatcher's state of mourning, checking in on him every so often to bring him food. However, after realizing Flycatcher was allowing himself to starve to death, Ride scolds him for giving up on life and encourages him to take action rather than waste away. Ride's message led Fly to start his journey through the Witching Well and to eventually form the Haven. During Flycatcher's heroic quest, Red Riding Hood, along with many of Fly's other friends, regularly watched Flycatcher's adventures through the magic mirror in the business office, which they dubbed \\"Fly T.V.\\". While everyone else watched Fly's journey with excitement, Red Riding Hood was wracked with anxiety and feared for Flycatcher's life, often bemoaning the amount of danger that Flycatcher often found himself in. She kept his favorite hat with her at all times, hoping to return it to him when his quest was over. After Fly's kingdom was established and became safe, Boy Blue brought Ride along with him so she could move there. Upon arriving, she told Fly that she would fill in the roles of Royal Hostess and take on queenly responsibilities until Flycatcher could find himself a proper queen. The two continued to fall in love, though Flycatcher still denied his feelings for her out of fear of betraying the memory of his dead wife. During the Out to the Ballgame arc, Fly finally acknowledges his feelings for Riding Hood and kissed her, which accidentally turns him back into a frog. Riding Hood, tired of living in the shadow of Flycatcher's former wife, tells him that he has let his guilt rule him for too long, and that it is keeping him from finding happiness in the present. Flycatcher, convinced by Riding Hood's words, attempts to take control of his curse and changes himself back into human form. Later that evening, tired of being alone, he asks Red to share his bed with him, to which she delightedly accepts. In the epilogue chapter, \\"The Last Story of Flycatcher\\", Red Riding Hood is revealed to have eventually married Flycatcher and had at least four children with him, and is living a peaceful life as queen of Haven. The Tourists The Tourists are a group of three Fables who originally worked for Bigby Wolf on keeping track of those Fables who have chosen not to live in Fabletown or up at the Farm. Since Bigby's departure, they now work for his replacement, Beast. =Mowgli= The first Tourist is Mowgli, from The Jungle Book. He is assigned the mission of tracking down the missing Bigby and bringing him back to Fabletown. While this is outside the Tourists' normal duties, he accepts the mission when Prince Charming informs him that his friend Bagheera, imprisoned for his role in the Farm revolt, would be freed once his mission was completed. Mowgli is primarily given this assignment because, unlike the other Tourists, he was raised by wolves, and thus knows how Bigby would think. The task takes many months and covered thousands of miles, but Mowgli is ultimately successful. During The Good Prince, Mowgli replaces King Cole as ambassador to Baghdad, as well as running an English-language school for Arabian Fables participating in the war against the Empire. =Feathertop= The second Tourist is Feathertop, the animated scarecrow from a Nathaniel Hawthorne short story. He appeared in \\"A Wolf in the Fold\\", a prose tale in the series' first trade paperback, where he accompanies Snow White on her mission to invite the Big Bad Wolf to join them in Fabletown in approximately 1650. He was chosen because, as an entity made of straw and vegetation, the Wolf would be unable to read his emotions and would find him unpalatable. His identity as one of the Tourists tourist is confirmed in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love, where he appears in silhouette in a single panel. =The Woodsman= Bill Willingham has identified the third Tourist as being the Woodsman from the tale of Little Red Riding Hood He appears in flashbacks from the fairy tale in the March of the Wooden Soldiers story arc and the Fables graphic novel 1001 Nights of Snowfall. In addition, all of the tourists are shown in silhouette in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love, but not referred to by name. The Woodsman is also mentioned in The Great Fables Crossover, in which Bigby implies that he still harbours vengeful feelings for him and is just as mad at him as he is at Jack (which does mean a lot) and that his current whereabouts are unknown. The Woodsman makes an appearance in the prequel adventure video game The Wolf Among Us Tommy Sharp Tommy Sharp was a writer for the Daily News. He somehow got wind that there was something unusual about the Fabletown community and spent several years following it up. He tracked down records detailing the Fables' possession of the area right back to when the city was called New Amsterdam, compiled a number of personal histories and located photographs of several of the Fabletown residents going back to the beginnings of photography, proving that none of them had aged a day. He also secretly trailed Bigby Wolf, a not unimpressive feat, given the Wolf's massively enhanced senses and witnessed him changing to his wolf form in Central Park. In the story A Two-Part Caper, Sharp came to Fabletown and asked to speak to Bigby, with the aim of giving the Fables a chance to respond to his story prior to publication as a journalistic courtesy. Explaining to a visibly amused sheriff that he believed them to be vampires, Sharp stated that he would shortly be publishing his story. The concerned Wolf, realizing that even if nobody official believed the story, they'd be inundated with goths and vampire-wannabes, quickly formulated a plan to steal all of Sharp's research, using Briar Rose's enchantment to put all the occupants of the building to sleep while they ransacked his apartment. It quickly became apparent, however, that Sharp had backed all his information on the internet. Bluebeard, who was supposed to be keeping watch downstairs, insisted that they should simply shoot Sharp, belittling Bigby when he chose a different course of action. Kidnapping Sharp, the Fables took a number of photographs of him posed with Pinocchio, in such a manner to make it appear that Sharp was a pedophile. They then informed Sharp that if he published his story, they would release these photos, plus a videotape of an interview with Pinocchio where he explained what Sharp had supposedly done to him by pointing out on a teddy bear where Sharp touched him, thus destroying Sharp's reputation completely. Sharp had no choice but to cooperate. Bluebeard, however, felt differently. Believing, as always, that he knew best and probably in no small part to spite Bigby, he summoned Sharp to Central Park where he asked Sharp if he had destroyed all his research; when Sharp confirmed he had, Bluebeard executed the journalist. Gretel After Hansel and Gretel's misadventure in the Homelands involving Frau Totenkinder, whom the children pushed into her own oven, Hansel and Gretel emerged from the Black Forest to find their land overrun by the Adversary's forces. They fled, staying ahead of the invading armies and taking sanctuary in one church after another until they learn of the mundane world. Arriving there in the mid-17th Century, they made their way to the newly established Fabletown, where they were shocked to discover Frau Totenkinder among the Fables already present. When informed that, under the terms of the Fabletown Compact, Totenkinder had been granted amnesty for her actions in the Homelands, a disgusted Hansel announced his intention to live among the mundane population, leaving his sister behind in Fabletown. Many years later, Hansel visited Fabletown, asking to see his sister, begging her to leave Fabletown. Gretel refused, explaining to him that she has spent time studying with Frau Totenkinder in the intervening years and has gained a new appreciation for the magic arts, seeing them not as the devil's work, but as a useful tool. Horrified and enraged, Hansel struck her viciously with a chair, snapping her neck instantly. As a result, Hansel was stricken from the Fabletown Compact and banished forever. Gretel's body was cast down the witching well. Her spirit remained there in a sort of limbo for centuries, until Flycatcher, his memory restored and finally ready to face his past, went down the well, finding all the ghosts of those who had previously been thrown there. Gretel was one of the many spirits who were given flesh and blood and followed Flycatcher to Haven. Civilized Apes (maybe) In Jack'n Apes of Jack Of Fables, Jack Horner claims that his own adventures inspired Edgar Rice Burroughs to write the whole Tarzan legend (which would then mean that either Tarzan does not exist in the Fables series, or he was just Jack) - and that, in turn, inspired Jack to go to Hollywood, which led to the creation of his own series. Apes and monkeys he claims to have met are: *Kong: \\"A gorilla of note\\" *Magilla: \\"Another gorilla of no consequence\\" *George: \\"Too curious by half\\" *Jane: From whom Tarzan's Jane has been inspired ... still according to Jack *\\"Clint the orangutan\\": A possible reference to the pet orangutan Clyde of the Clint Eastwood films Every Which Way but Loose and Any Which Way You Can *\\"Edgar the other orangutan\\": Presumably the murderous orangutan from Edgar Allan Poe's short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue *Aesop: \\"Wise beyond his years\\". Presumably the ape of Aesop's Fables The Wolf, the Fox and the Ape and The Apes and the Two Travellers *Saunders: A sock monkey. A possible reference to A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh; a sign over the door at Pooh's house says \\"Mr. Sanders\\", the name of the person who resided at the very address prior to Pooh making it his house. Winnie the Pooh and several other characters from the books were actually based on the stuffed toys of Milne's son. In addition, a character looking remarkably similar to Winnie the Pooh (but drawn slightly differently, as Winnie the Pooh is currently under copyright) can be seen in flashbacks from the Homelands, barbecuing marshmallows with Saunders in what appears to be the Hundred Acre Wood. Jack being an unreliable narrator and a pathological liar, it is impossible to tell for sure if he was telling the truth. On the other hand, he has told the truth on several occasions (about the Wooden Soldiers, about his days as Jack Frost and about the Literals, to name just a few) - besides, the insistence he displays when telling he did not have an affair with the female ape Jane may be proof that his tale is true ... at least partially. Shadow Fabletown A network of hidden Fable communities, scattered throughout the world, as seen in the Fables spin-off Cinderella: Fables Are Forever. Among the Fables of Shadow Fabletown are: *Ivan Durak, a character from Russian folklore. One of many Fables who fled the Fable homeland of Rus when the Adversary invaded, and escaped into the mundane world, adopting the Soviet Union as their new home. At some point, perhaps after a failed attempt to kidnap Snow White in the 1980s, he was killed and Dorothy Gale assumed his identity. She may have most likely killed him, herself, after her escape from Golden Burroughs Community. *Tugarin Zmeyevich, a dragon who can take the shape of a man. He is the ruler of Shadow Fabletown in Russia. *Meng Chiang-Nu, a character from Chinese folktales. An old woman who is the former head of the Shadow Fabletown in China. According to Cinderella, Meng Chiang-Nu \\"sought her husband at the Great Wall, went through a lot of trouble to get him buried after he died, and ended up turning into a fish. She refused to give up when an emperor and his whole empire told her no.\\" Meng Chiang-Nu was killed by a Chiss, when she was about to tell Cindy how to locate Dorothy Gale. *The Seven Chinese Brothers: The associates and possible bodyguards of Meng-Chiang-Nu. From the anonymously written Chinese folktale \\"The Five Brothers\\" (circa A.D. 300). In some versions of the story, there were seven, or even ten, brothers. In the west, the tale was popularized by Claire Huchet Bishop's Five Chinese Brothers (1938), and Margaret Mahy's Seven Chinese Brothers (1889) more or less permanently changed the number of brothers to seven in the West.Nevins, Jess, Willingham, Bill, Buckingham, Mark (2013). Fables Encyclopedia. New York. DC Comics. *Anansi, a West African Fable who is a high-ranking member of one of the hidden shadow Fable communities. He may have been part of Dorothy's schemes to trap Cinderella. Though what became of him afterward was never stated. Japanese Fables A group of characters and creatures from Japanese folklore. They live in a hidden Fable community in Tokyo, as seen in the Fairest story arc The Hidden Kingdom. *Kuchisake-onna, the slit-mouthed woman from Japanese urban legends, appears in the Fairest story arc The Hidden Kingdom. Her real name is Mayumi. Before the Adversary's invasion, she was a member of the Heika's court in the Fable Homeland of the Hidden Kingdom. Unbeknown to her, the Seii Taishogun was secretly laying the way for the invasion and planned to become the new ruler of the Hidden Kingdom. He offered to make her Mayumi his Empress, but she rejected him and called him \\"a parasite on the court\\". He responded by slitting Mayumi's cheeks in anger. Unable to live with her face mutilated like that, she committed seppuku (a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment) - \\"or someone faked it\\". Her ghost began lurking in the washrooms and corridors of the Heika's palace, haunting mirrors. Eventually, she managed to take on a physical form and escaped the Homelands with a group of yokai who had been banished from the court. The group started a new life in a hidden Fable community in Tokyo. Centuries later, she has become the enforcer of Tomoko, a powerful female kitsune who is a Yakuza leader. Mayumi wears a surgical mask to hide the disfigurement. She enjoys scaring people by asking them, \\"Am I beautiful?\\", before removing the mask and asking \\"How about now?\\". Eventually, with the help of Rapunzel, the fugitives manage to find their way back to their homeland via a magical portal. *Assorted yokai: Including various kitsune, kappa, rokurokubi, bakeneko, funayurei and tanuki (only referred to as \\"raccoons\\"). Others *Count Dracula: The prose story A Wolf in the Fold mentions a Transylvanian count who had befriended Bigby Wolf, before he was taken to Fabletown. The count was rumored to be some fell spirit returned from the dead. In the Fables story The Ascent, Frankenstein's monster (\\"Frankie\\") specifically makes references to a vampire count back in Transylvania. Frankie had actually fought the count once, years before he fought the \\"wolf man\\" (Bigby) during World War II. Most (if not all) of the killings traditionally credited to vampires and werewolves in the Dracula mythos were Bigby's doing in the Fables series (though Dracula let local peasants believe they were his own doing, to enhance his fearsome reputation) - making it hard to judge if vampires and werewolves are Fables and if this Dracula is a real Fable or just the historical Vlad Tepes. During Bigby's adventures during World War 2, Nazis revealed that they had knowledge of at least one werewolf - which, according to \\"Werewolves of the Heartland, was actually Bigby. In \\"Werewolves Of The Heartlands\\", it is revealed that there used to be werewolves in the homelands and in the mundane world - also, a new breed of werewolves is created. *The Grim Reaper: Has a run-in with Jack Horner in the Fables story Bag 'O Bones, in which Jack finds a way to cheat death. *Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein: Referred to in War Stories, a Fables story set during World War II. A team of German Nazi scientists is using Frankenstein's monster talks about how they tried to create more of the monster in World War I, but when it didn't work, they realized that the secrets of Doctor Frankenstein's process had died with him. It is unknown whether he was a Fable or one of the unmagic \\"mundys\\" of our world. After defeating the Nazis, Bigby kept the monster's still-living head and returned it to Fabletown. In the March of the Wooden Soldiers story arc, Pinocchio can be seen reading the Frankenstein novel. *Jill: The Jill from Jack and Jill (not to be confused with Jill the Lilliputian, who helps Jack steal some of Bluebeard's fortune). Jack phones her before going to Hollywood. It is unknown if she lives in Fabletown. *The Lone Ranger and Tonto: The duo makes an off-screen appearance in the Jack of Fables story arc 1883, which is set in the Old West. A gunsmith sells a special order of silver bullets to the Lone Ranger instead of Jack Horner, believing the Ranger to be part of Jack's gang of robbers. The Ranger is described as a mysterious masked rider with a faithful Native American companion. Jack kills the gunsmith in anger and sets out to find the Lone Ranger in Montana, following his trail. Jack is apprehended by Bigby before he has the chance to catch up with him. *Elves from The Elves and the Shoemaker: still offering their services to the shoemaker (Crispin, who lives in Fabletown) from time to time, as seen in Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love. They have also been secretly working for Beauty in making the Fable comics sold at Nod's bookstore, while Beauty was working there. *The Cricket on the Hearth: In \\"All in a Single Night\\", the cricket from Charles Dickens' novella takes Rose Red on a journey on Christmas Eve, in a Fables takes on A Christmas Carol. \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" is also the name of one of the issue's chapters. The cricket repeatedly calls Rose \\"Boz\\", which was Dickens's family nickname and occasional pen-name. *Noah the bottle Imp: A small, less powerful version of a genie, who specializes in information. He helps Ali Baba achieve his dream of wealth and love by hooking him up with Lumi, the Snow Queen, after Ali Baba wakes Briar Rose from enchanted sleep and realizes that Briar is not the girl for him. *Saint George: Appears as a detective in the Fairest story Lamia, tracking down the issue's title character - the Lamia, a.k.a. Beauty - in a story set in 1940s Los Angeles. With the sword Ascalon, he had slain the dragon in his Fable homeland of Silene. With it he also slew the beast Chim√¶ra, the dragon Illuyankas, the dragon Tiamat and the serpent Vritra. It is strongly implied that Beast kills him in order to protect Beauty. *Dragon from Saint George and the Dragon: Referred to in the Fairest story Lamia. *The Chim√¶ra: Referred to in the Fairest story Lamia. It was slain by Saint George. *Illuyankas the dragon: Referred to in the Fairest story Lamia. Slain by Saint George. *Tiamat: A dragon referred to in the Fairest story Lamia. Also slain by Saint George. *The serpent Vritra: Referred to in the Fairest story Lamia. Yet another beast slain by Saint George. *Lady Maeve: From Irish mythology. She is from the Fable Homeland Dunhollow, and is one of Rose Red's new Knights of the Round Table, as seen in the Camelot story arc. The Wolf Among Us Fables first introduced in the prequel video game The Wolf Among Us. *Faith, a prostitute who was found murdered in the first episode of the game, \\"Faith\\". After the Woodsman attacks her, Bigby steps in and saves her. When she's found murdered later, Bigby finds her ring stuffed in her severed head, which bears a symbol that lead to her identity. Her story states that she escaped her father, the king, by using a magic coat made from his prize donkey; she married Prince Laurence before the exodus from the Homelands. Fallen on hard times in Fabletown, Faith estranged from Laurence and turned to prostitution, and Laurence, out of guilt for burdening her, tried to commit suicide (based on the player's actions, he has a chance to survive and appear at Lily's funeral in episode 3). *Toad Jr., or \\"TJ\\". The son of Mister Toad, who is the landlord of tenement building the Woodsman lived in. Helps Bigby and Snow find a clue in Faith's donkey-skin coat, which she wore to the Woodsman's apartment and left behind after he and Bigby fought. In episode two, TJ witnesses the dumping of a woman's corpse into the east river by two unknown men, and Snow retrieves it by herself. *Dee and Dum Tweedle. Twin brothers who claim were hired as private detectives by an unknown employer to investigate Faith. Dee roughs up Mr. Toad while looking for The Woodsman and something thought to be in his possession; Dee is pursued and caught by Bigby when they meet at Faith's and Laurence's apartment, but Dum saves him. At the Trip Trap Bar, Dee encounters Bigby again, and the player has to choose whether to arrest Dee or the Woodsman. If the player arrests Dee, he reveals in his interrogation that Faith stole something of value from his unknown employer and Beauty later reveals that Dee and Dum had been harassing her to pay back a loan she owes to The Crooked Man; this implies that The Crooked Man sent Dee and Dum to get back something Faith stole from him. In Episode 3, Dee and Dum interrupt Lily's funeral and threaten Bigby into not pursuing Crane, and this ends with the Tweedles shooting and injuring Gren and Holly. If Bigby investigates the brothers' office, he learns that they are indeed working for the Crooked Man to get money Crane owes to him, which he embezzled from Fabletown. Bigby also learns that Dee and Dum hired Flycatcher as their janitor when Crane fired him from the Woodlands, and Bigby can offer his position at the Woodlands back to him when Flycatcher realizes they're hitmen and decideds he doesn't want to work for them anymore. Episode 3 ends with the brothers and Bloody Mary cornering and shooting Bigby, which prompts him to go full-wolf and attack (the player can also choose whether or not to kill Tweedledum). *Holly, a female troll who owns and runs the Trip Trap Bar; friends with the Woodsman, Gren, and Jack Horner. Gren says that her sister is missing. Snow later finds the corpse of a female Fable using a black-market glamour to appear as Snow, and the body is revealed to be Lily, Holly's sister. Holly is informed of her sister's death by Bigby, and what she says next sends Bigby to investigate her pimp Georgie Porgie. In episode 3, Holly is outraged at Bigby when she learned that Lily's corpse was thrown down the Witching Well, even when Snow tells her that was Crane's doing; Holly and Gren are then injured fighting the Tweedles when they interrupt the proceedings. At the Trip Trap in episode 3, Holly, rendered confused and lethargic due to the medicine Dr. Swineheart gave her for her injuries, has a conversation with Bigby while he roots through Lily's possessions for a clue to the witch Crane had hired. *Grendel, or Gren, a barfly who regulars the Trip Trap Bar. He first appears waiting in line to see Acting Mayor Ichabod Crane and calls Bigby a \\"fucker\\". He later appears at the Trip Trap Bar. When Bigby meets the Woodsman at the Bar, Gren drops his glamour (appearing as a giant, shark-like beast with pale skin and eyes) and attacks Bigby; Bigby wins by partially morphing into his wolf form and targeting Gren's right arm, implying it was reattached after Beowulf ripped it off in the old legend. After beating Gren in the fight, the player can choose to rip off his arm or not (this choice persists in the remaining episodes). In episode 3, Gren helps Holly fight the Tweedles when they interrupt Lily's funeral, and both are injured. When Bigby goes to the Trip Trap later in episode 3, Gren is high on the medicine provided by Swineheart for his injuries and gets into a fight with Woodsman about how he was hiring Lily to have sex with him and that Holly found out after she died; Gren later passes out from the drugs. *Georgie Porgie, the pimp who employed Faith and Lily. He is introduced in the second episode, \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\". Georgie is first seen yelling at one of his girls, Narissa, at his strip club, the Pudding And Pie. Bigby intimidates Georgie into handing over a planner his girls use to record their \\"jobs\\" and uses it to find the hotel room Lily had with a client before she was killed. In episode 3, when Bigby and Snow barge into the club to find and arrest Crane, Georgie calls someone on his phone and says \\"We have a problem\\" (presumably the Crooked Man). *Clever Hans is the handyman, janitor, and bouncer for the Pudding And Pie. A well-meaning simpleton, Hans accidentally reveals the planner the prostitutes use when Georgie was arguing with Bigby. Georgie threatens Hans with a cricket bat for revealing the book, but Bigby takes the bat and threatens to trash the club with it for the book. *Narissa, once known as The Little Mermaid, is a stripper and prostitute working for Georgie Porgie. Unable to break her code of silence (\\"these lips are sealed\\"), Narissa gets Bigby to pay for her services so she can give him a room key for The Open Arms Hotel, where Georgie's girls use to service their johns. Bigby goes to The Open Arms to find the room Lily last used and investigate what he later learns is the site of her murder. Narissa appears at Lily's funeral in episode 3, and is later attacked by Crane at the Pudding And Pie. *Auntie Greenleaf is a witch living outside of the Thirteenth Floor of the Woodlands, and the one providing illegal glamours for Ichabod Crane to have sex with Lily in the form of Snow White. When Bigby and Snow find her apartment, she glamours herself into the form of a little girl named Rachel (presumably her deceased daughter) in an attempt to throw the duo off the trail. When they uncover the ruse, Greenleaf refuses to help them find Crane, warning them of \\"forces beyond their authority\\". When Snow threatens to burn down her ancient tree, which is both a family heirloom and what she uses to create her back-alley glamours, she tells them that Crane was at her apartment to take from her possession the Ring of Dispel, so he could undo the spell that keeps Georgie's girls from breaking their silence so Crane could prove himself innocent of Lily's and Faith's murders (Greenleaf says that the Ring lost its power decades ago). After they get this info out of Greenleaf, the player can decide whether or not to continue with destroying the tree. * Vivian is Georgie's lover and second-in-command at the Pudding & Pie. Her origin fable is shrouded in mystery for much of the story, but her true identity as The Girl with the Ribbon is revealed, when Georgie explains that she found a way to duplicate her magic ribbon and transfer its curse to the women she and Georgie employed. Filled with regret over the murders, she decides to break the spell on the women by taking off the ribbon, killing herself in the process. *Bloody Mary is an assassin working for the Crooked Man. She appears as a woman with short black hair with a red-dyed streak in it, and she claims that she kills mundane children for fun. She and the Tweedles corner Bigby, Snow, and Crane in an alley so they can kidnap Crane. After she gets Dee and Dum to shoot at Bigby until he transforms into a wolf- man, she shoots and disables Bigby with a silver bullet from her revolver so she can chop off his head with an axe (heavily implying that she is the one who killed Faith and Lily, at the Crooked Man's behest); Snow surrenders Crane, so the Crooked Man signals Mary to spare Bigby (she breaks his arm instead). * The Crooked Man is the main antagonist of the game's storyline. Back in the Homelands, he killed his wife and child, not wanting to share his fortune with them. In Fabletown he has become a crime boss who claims to be legitimate businessman who provides help to downtrodden Fables by offering them cheap glamours and employment, but in reality, his organisation is a thinly disguised racketeering ring which muscles in on other businesses and keeps its members in forced servitude through heavy debts, threats and acts of violence, and even torture. The Crooked Man is articulate, cunning, and manipulative, and likes to put on airs of sophistication, but when he loses his temper he reveals a terrifying and unrelenting ruthlessness. At the end of the game's storyline, he is found guilty of murder and either thrown down the Witching Well, turned into a caged raven by Aunty Greenleaf and send to the Farm, or brutally decapitated by Bigby.

Early years Lionel D√©sir√©- Marie-Ren√©-Fran√ßois, Marquis de Moustier was born in Paris on 23 August 1817, son of Cl√©ment-√âdouard, Marquis de Moustier (1779-1830). His mother was Marie- Caroline de La Forest. His father was an ardent legitimist. Lionel inherited a large fortune. He married Fanny de M√©rode, niece of Philippe-F√©lix-Balthasar- Othon Ghislain, Count of M√©rode (1791-1857), whose daughter Marie-Anne married Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert. Lionel de Moustiere and Fanny had two daughters, one of whom married the Marquis de Marmier. Under King Louis- Philippe he was a member of the general council of the department of Doubs. In 1848 he was a candidate for election in Franche-Comt√©, his native land. He was elected to represent the department of Doubs on 13 May 1849 by conservative monarchists. He sat on the right, and continued to support the administration until the coup of 2 December 1851. He was appointed to the Advisory Committee, but soon resigned. Ambassador On 10 March 1853 Lionel de Moustier was appointed minister plenipotentiary in Berlin, where he helped to ensure the neutrality of Prussia during the Crimean War. He had a scandalous affair in Berlin with the daughter of M. Delaunay, the minister of Sardinia in Prussia. Moustier was in Berlin during the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, when France and the Kingdom of Sardinia were at war with Austria in Lombardy. Moustier was warned that Berlin would intervene if France failed to accept mediation. Moustier provided statistics that showed that Prussia was mobilizing a force that could readily defeat France's army on the Rhine. He remained in Berlin until November 1859, when he was appointed Ambassador of France at the court of Austria. On 28 August 1861 he was appointed Ambassador in Constantinople, a difficult position. Foreign Minister On 1 September 1866 de Moustier replaced √âdouard Drouyn de Lhuys as Minister of Foreign Affairs. During an 1866 crisis in Romania, Moustier counselled the emperor to advise and support the Porte in Constantinople, but to avoid interfering in internal affairs in the Turkish empire, and to work together with England in this, since England had essentially the same policy. While in office he also had to handle the question of the annexation of Luxembourg with Prussia. In the Roman question he enforced the convention of 15 September and opposed the concessions proposed by General Federico Luigi Menabrea, Italian Prime Minister. He was willing to submit the issue to Congress, but did not succeed. Speaking in Senate he responded to Cardinal de Bonnechose and to Baron Charles Dupin that the government would support the rights of the Pope as well as Italian unification. Last years In 1867 Lionel de Moustier was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. With failing health, he left office in December 1868, and on 17 December 1868 was appointed senator. He continued to support the imperial regime in the senate. He died on 5 February 1869. His son, Pierre Ren√©, was deputy for Doubs from 1889 to 1921, and senator from 1921 to 1935. His grandson L√©onel de Moustier was also deputy for Doubs, elected in 1928. L√©onel was active in the Resistance during World War II, was captured by the Germans and died in 1945.

He was made Sheriff of London for 1453‚Äì54, an alderman from 1456 and Member of Parliament for the City of London in 1460 and 1470. He was elected Lord Mayor of London for 1462‚Äì63 and knighted in 1465. In 1467 he began to build a mansion called Gidea Hall, near Romford in Essex, which was only completed by his descendant, Sir Anthony Cooke. In 1467 he was charged with high treason for lending money to Margaret, the queen of the deposed Lancastrian King Henry VI, on the strength of a confession of a statement obtained under torture from one Hawkins. Chief Justice Markham directed the jury to find it only misprision of treason, whereby Cooke's lands and life were saved, though he was heavily fined and long imprisoned. While awaiting his trial in the Tower his effects, both at his town house and at Gidea Hall, were seized by Lord Rivers, then treasurer of England, and his wife was committed to the custody of the mayor. On his acquittal he was sent to the Bread Street compter, and afterwards to the king's bench, and was kept there until he paid eight thousand pounds to the king and eight hundred pounds to the queen. Lord Rivers and his wife, the Duchess of Bedford, also obtained the dismissal of Markham from his office for having determined that Cooke was not guilty of treason. He died in 1478 and was buried in the church of the Augustine friars, within the ward of Broad Street in London. He had married Elizabeth, the daughter and coheiress of Alderman Philip Malpas, one of the leaders of the Lancastrian party within the city. They had one daughter and four sons, the eldest of whom was Philip, who was afterwards knighted. Thomas Cooke's will stated that he owned at least four brewhouses, taverns, and beerhouses, besides fishing-weirs on the Colne, a large farm at Gidea Hall, and numerous properties and manors in London, Surrey, Essex, and Kent.

The doctrine states that since the skull is incompressible, and the volume inside the skull is fixed then any increase in volume of one of the cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another. Previous research about George Kellie (1720‚Äì1779) may have been hampered by a widely cited incorrect year of birth, by the spelling of his name as Kellie or Kelly and by confusion with his father, also a surgeon in Leith, with the same name and subject to similar spelling variations.  Early life  George Kellie was born in Leith, the seaport for Edinburgh which was at that time the fifth largest town in Scotland.Webster Census His parents George Kellie (1742‚Äì1805), originally from Dunbar, East Lothian, and Catherin [sic] McCall of Haddington, East Lothian had married in South Leith in August 1769Scotland's People On his baptismal entry in the parish of Dunbar, East Lothian for 6 October 1742 George senior's surname is spelt Kellie, as is that of his father. In the South Leith parish records of his marriage to Catherin McCall in August 1764 and the record of the birth of his son, the spelling is given as 'Kelly'. George Kellie senior practised as a surgeon and while there is no record of his registration as a surgical apprentice in Wallis's extensive listing of British medical and surgical apprentices that listing showed that he trained three apprentices between 1771‚Äì75.Wallis PJ, Wallis R, Whittet T. Eighteenth century medics: subscriptions, licenses, apprenticeships. Newcastle. University of Newcastle. 1985 The Street directories for Edinburgh and Leith for the years 1773‚Äì1805 show that ‚ÄòGeorge Kelly‚Äô senior practised as a surgeon in Tolbooth Wynd, Leith, the only Kelly or Kellie listed in Leith for that period. In 1774 he published a paper describing a case of extensive surgical emphysema which, after consulting with Alexander Monro secundus, he had successfully treated by inserting of a cannula into the thoracic cavity.Kellie G., An Account of the Paracentesis Being Performed in the Thorax for the Cure of an Emphysema, Medical and Philosophical commentaries 1774;2:427-3 George Kelly senior died at Leith on 3 April 1805, the spelling of his name on the death notice reverting to 'Kellie'. George Kellie junior followed his father into a career as a surgeon in Leith after serving a five year apprenticeship to the Edinburgh surgeon James Arrott (1760‚Äì1818).  Naval service  As Arrott had done before him Kellie joined the Royal Navy in 1790 as a surgeon.The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany 1818;81:500 During this naval service he published papers in the form of letters to his father ‚ÄòMr Kellie, surgeon, Leith‚Äô. A letter to Edinburgh Medical Commentaries dated 21 May 1794 show that he is now surgeon on HMS Iris, a 32 gun, fifth rate frigate. In this letter he records experiments on himself, describing the effects of compressing the arm by tourniquet.Kellie G.

On 21 November 1805 he married Ann Wight, daughter of Robert Wight of the Murrays near Ormiston in East Lothian, maintaining his family links with that region. He now published a series of papers on a diverse range of medical and surgical topics.Macintyre I. A hotbed of medical innovation: George Kellie (1770‚Äì1829), his colleagues at Leith and the Monro‚ÄìKellie doctrine J Med Biogr 0967772013479271 16 September 2013 doi:10.1177/0967772013479271  Paper on intracranial circulation  In the paper which was to give Kellie lasting eponymous fame he describes the post mortem appearances in the bodies of two individuals found dead after lying outside after a storm.Kellie G. An account of the appearances observed in the dissection of two of three individuals presumed to have perished in the storm of the 3rd, and whose bodies were discovered in the vicinity of Leith on the morning of the 4th, November 1821 : with some reflections on the pathology of the brain. Transactions of the Medico- Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh 1824;1:82‚Äì169 He was asked by local magistrates to try to establish the cause of death. Kellie noted that the veins in the meninges and surface of the brain were congested and the associated arteries were relatively bloodless while the brain was otherwise normal. In concluding that the individuals died from exposure he quotes a similar case described by Samuel Quelmalz (1696‚Äì1758) where exposure results in a progression through weariness, lassitude, drowsiness, coma and death which he ascribes to disordered cerebral circulation. He concluded 'When the cavity of the cranium is encroached upon by depression of its walls compensation may be made at the expense of circulatory fluid within the head; less blood is admitted and circulated'. Kellie gave credit to two of his Edinburgh contemporaries for their contributions in the shaping of this concept, Alexander Monro secundus (' ‚Ä¶ my illustrious preceptor in anatomy, the second Monro') and John Abercrombie. Monro had stated that since the healthy cranial cavity is rigid and of constant volume and the brain 'is nearly incompressible, the quantity of blood within the head must remain the same'.Monro A. Observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system: illustrated with tables. Edinburgh: Printed for, and sold by, William Creech 1783 Later in the paper Kellie described how Monro, aware of his interest, invited him jointly to examine the brains of executed criminals and sent him descriptions of autopsy findings in other similar cases. He gives Abercrombie particular credit when he writes 'the argument has already been taken up and illustrated by Dr Abercrombie, in his ingenious analysis of apoplexy ‚Ä¶ '. In 1818 Abercrombie indeed had ‚Äòproposed a doctrine‚Äô clearly setting out the hypothesis. Abercrombie was largely responsible for the doctrine becoming widely known and accepted around the world. His authoritative book Pathological and Practical Researches on Disease of the Brain and Spinal Cord first published in 1828 was a milestone in neuropathology which ran to three British, two American and French and German editions.Abercrombie J. Pathological and practical researches on disease of the brain and spinal cord. Edinburgh: J Carfrae; 1828 In it Abercrombie linked the theories of Monro and Kellie and gave them full credit for the hypothesis  Testing the doctrine  As Abercrombie had done before him, Kellie went on to test his theories with a series of animal experiments where he studied the cerebral circulation of sheep and of dogs immediately after exsanguination or death induced by cyanide. He found that in many instances while the tissues outwith the cranium were drained of blood, the brain was not affected in this way, retaining blood volume. He concluded that where the circulating blood volume was depleted, the volume circulating within the cranium remained constant, with the increase in arterial tone and consequent reduction in arterial blood volume being compensated by venous engorgement thus keeping the total blood volume constant. The English physician Dr (later Sir) George Burrows (1801‚Äì1887) later tested the hypothesis with CSF included in the equation. Burrows G. On disorders of the cerebral circulation and on the connection between affections of the brain and diseases of the heart. London: Longman; 1846 He repeated Kellie‚Äôs experiments using animal exsanguination and concluded that a depletion of CSF volume was compensated by an increase in intracranial blood volume and vice versa, so validating the hypothesis. Harvey Cushing (1869‚Äì1939)and his researcher Lewis Weed (1886‚Äì1952) tested the theory in the light of increasing knowledge and Weed found that ' ... in every way Monro-Kellie doctrine must be considered essentially correct'.Weed L. Some limitations of the Monro‚ÄìKellie hypothesis. Archives of surgery 1929;18 The development of techniques to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP) have allowed more sophisticated testing of the doctrine and shown that the hypothesis formulated by Monro, Kellie and Abercrombie still holds good.Mokri B. The Monro-Kellie hypothesis: applications in CSF volume depletion. Neurology 2001;56:1746-8 Later life and death Kellie went on to achieve local distinction in his lifetime. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in December 1823. In 1827 he was elected President of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society and was succeeded in that office by John Abercrombie. George Kellie collapsed and died in Leith on 28 September 1829 while on his way home from visiting a patient.Martine J. Reminiscences of port and town of Leith.

She was initiated into the dance form at five and flowered as a professional dancer while in her teens. She worked in England for several years as a dance educator, choreographer and performer. She has also founded an arts centre called Srijati in Kolkata where she has trained several dancers and formed her own dance troupe. Her innovative choreography has received positive reviews both in India and abroad. Recently she has performed extensively in France and has introduced many dancers to the form of Odissi in Paris. She has also performed and held workshops in Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Romania, US and Canada. Early life and education  Srinwanti was born in Bardhaman in West Bengal and later moved to Kolkata with her family. She studied at St. Xavier's school in Bardhaman and at Auxilium Convent in Kolkata. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Presidency College, Kolkata and then her Master of Arts degree in the same from the University of Calcutta. Even in her childhood Srinwanti had a penchant for dancing; she started dance training under her mother and was inducted into the Odissi dance form when only five. She was first guided and groomed by Smt. Sutapa Talukdar and Smt. Nandini Ghosal. Her talents flourished under the tutelage of Kelucharan Mohapatra who helped her immensely in learning the intricacies of the dance form. Her father was a major inspiration behind her choosing a career in Indian classical dance which is not very usual in India in families with no other professional performing artist. Srinwanti was also interested to pursue her doctoral studies for which she started researching on dance movement therapy and the application of traditional dance in bringing social wellness. Earlier she wrote a paper titled Hindu temple Women (Devdasi) - The Divine Prostitution as part of her master's thesis. Due to her commitment in her professional career as a dancer she could not pursue her doctoral studies further.  Career in dance  Srinwanti identified her life with the rhythm of Odissi and she dedicated herself to the arduous practice of the classical genre from young. As a prodigy Srinwanti acquired a high level of expertise in the dance form even when a teenager. By the age of 15, Srinwanti was a professional dancer. She included her own innovative choreography in her performances. In 2000, she started her own dance institute called Srijati in Kolkata, and her own dance troupe, mainly of her students. Both as a solo artist and along with her dance troupe, Srinwanti gave a series of dance shows and launched her productions throughout India. From 2006, Srinwanti worked intensively in England with the company Kala The Arts. She also conducted series of educational workshops and lecture demonstrations in schools, did choreographic productions which were commissioned by Anvil Arts and launched in various theatres and art centres. In 2010 she moved to Paris where she started her own dance association, Srijati. She has trained several dancers both at Kolkata and Paris. Srinwanti has performed and given workshops in USA, Canada, England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Romania and Sweden. She has performed both classical Odissi and her own experimental choreographic works.

It stands in the forecourt of the Sunday School that Whitaker established in 1814, and was placed there in 1846 to commemorate the school's fiftieth anniversary. The memorial was sculpted by Alfred Gatley in stone and marble, and contains a bust of Whitaker in a medallion on the south face. The monument is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History John Whitaker (1772‚Äì1820) was an alderman of Macclesfield Borough Council and a local magistrate. In 1796 he opened a free Sunday School in Pickford Street, which accommodated about 40 children. In doing this he was inspired by Robert Raikes who had initiated the Sunday School movement, and by David Simpson, a local Anglican priest who had earlier provided schools for poor children in the town. Unlike most Sunday Schools, Whitaker's school was non- denominational. In 1814 he followed this by opening a much larger purpose- built Sunday School in Roe Street. The school was financed by public subscription and by the children paying a small weekly fee. Whitaker died in 1820, but the school continued to flourish, and in 1844 a Day School was opened in the same building. These schools continued to function until they were closed in 1973. The fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the school was celebrated on 6 May 1846 by processions, speeches, feasting and unveiling a memorial to Whitaker in the forecourt of the school; the sculptor was Alfred Gatley. Since the closure of the school, the building has been converted to become Macclesfield Heritage Centre. There was a previousr memorial to Whitaker, which was created by Samuel Franceys and Son of Liverpool and was placed in the Sunday School in 1821. It consists of a bust of Whitaker surrounded by grieving scholars. This memorial is now in the auditorium of the Heritage Centre. Description The memorial is constructed in stone and marble, and stands about high. It consists of a tapering pedestal standing on steps, above which is a cornice decorated with acroteria. On top of this is a plain block surmounted by a draped urn. On the south face of the block is a medallion containing a bust of Whitaker in low relief. On the south face of the pediment is an inscription reading as follows. Appraisal The monument was designated as a Grade II listed building on 28 October 1994. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". In the Public Sculpture of Britain series, Morris and Roberts comment that it \\"has the design of a typical classicist church monument enlarged for an outside location\\".

Biography The son of a Cumberland mine owner, Miller was educated at Rugby School and Oxford, where he gained a double first, and was called to the bar in 1889, but never practised law. He married Ada Mary Wright in 1895, and in 1896 published The Balkans, followed in 1898 by Travels and Politics in the Near East. In 1903 he and his wife left England for Italy, and despite an effort by Ronald Burrows to recruit Miller as the first incumbent of the Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language, and Literature at London University, he and his wife spent the rest of their lives abroad. They lived in Rome (at Via Palestro 36) until 1923, when Miller found Benito Mussolini's rise to power distasteful, and they moved to Athens. There he was associated with the British School at Athens until the German invasion of Greece in 1941. During his time in Rome and Athens, Miller also served as correspondent of the Morning Post. Together the couple lived in the Ocean View Hotel in Durban, South Africa, for the rest of their lives. Miller died there in 1945, while Ada Mary surviving him by five years. They had no children. Works Miller was particularly interested in the Frankish period of Greek history, covering the Crusader principalities established on Greek soil following the Fourth Crusade. He was among the most eminent scholars of the field in the early 20th century, and produced a number of \\"landmark\\" studies. Although his work displays a \\"romantic view of the Crusades and the Frankish expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean\\" typical of 19th-century Western trends on the subject, and is considered \\"clearly outdated\\" given the research produced in recent decades, it has had a major influence and remains widely used to this day.

Fallize Johannes Olav Fallize, Ph.D., D.Th. (9 November 1844, Bettelange, Luxembourg, Belgium ‚Äì 23 October 1933, Luxembourg, Luxembourg ), was the first Roman Catholic bishop in Norway since the Reformation. As the head of the Catholic Church of Norway for 35 years, he was the Prefect Apostolic of Norway from 1887 to 1892 and the Vicar Apostolic of Norway from 1892 to 1922.  Background  Jean-Baptiste Fallize was actually born in Belgium to Luxembourger parents on 9 November 1844. In his autobiography, he wrote that his birth and baptism were both recorded in Belgium in Villers-la-Bonne-Eau, Malget, Fallize, pages 614 ff. (since 1977, a neighborhood of the city of Bastogne ) in the province of Luxembourg but his birth certificate showed that he was actually born in the nearby village of Bettelange Jean-Baptiste Fallize, Birth Certificate No. 22, dated 9 November 1844, Villers-la-Bonne- Eau, Province of Luxembourg, Belgium, in: FamilySearch, \\"Belgium, Luxembourg, Civil Registration, 1608‚Äì1912\\", Naissances [ Births ] 1841‚Äì1860, Villers-la- Bonne-Eau, Image 33, Item 1. ( , ), where his father had been working for a tannery. But the parents, Jean Fallize and Th√©r√®se Pfeffer, were Luxembourgers from Arsdorf ( ), now a part of the Municipality of Rambrouch ), in the canton of Redange. In 1850, when Jean-Baptiste was six years old, they moved with their children across the border to Harlange ( , , now in the municipality of Lac de la Haute-S√ªre ), in the canton of Wiltz, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In Harlange, Jean opened his own tanner's workshop and, in Harlange, the children would spend the rest of their childhood. One of them was Philippe-Michel Fallize, C.S.C. (1855‚Äì1920), a priest and missionary who served the Diocese of Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangladesh ) as its Vicar General for 21 years (1889‚Äì1910). Jean-Baptiste's parents sent him to the Ath√©n√©e de Luxembourg, the Grand Duchy's seminary for the priestly candidates in Luxembourg. After graduating in 1866, he accepted the request of Nicolas Adames, the first Bishop of Luxembourg, and went to Rome to study philosophy, theology and other subjects at the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum, the German-speaking seminary, and at the Pontifical Gregorian University, the Jesuit school. He was ordained as a priest at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran in Rome in 1871 and, in the following year, he earned his doctorates in philosophy and theology. When Fallize returned to Luxembourg in July 1872, he was appointed as the Associate Dean and Director of the new diocesan boarding school for boys. In 1876, he was consecrated as the priest of the parish of Pintsch ( ) in the canton of Wiltz in northern Luxembourg.  The Priest, The Journalist, The Politician  From the beginning, Fallize was politically active. He began as a journalist. He founded and edited two weekly newspapers, the Luxemburger Sonntags-bl√§ttchen f√ºr Stadt und Land [ Luxembourger Sunday Digest for the City and State ] (1874‚Äì1887) (renamed two years later as the Luxemburger Sonntagsblatt f√ºr Erbauung, Unterhaltung und Belehrung [ Luxembourger Sunday Journal for Edification, Entertainment and Education ] ), for the Catholic readers, and the Luxemburger Volksblatt [ Luxembourger People's Journal ] (1880‚Äì1885) for the political readers. To them he added the Luxemburger Marienkalendar [ St. Mary's Calendar ] in 1877. He had already written for another calendar before ‚Äì the Luxemburger Hauskalendar [ House Calendar ] in 1874. For his new calendar, he would write for the next ten years, until 1887. Within a few years, he had the control of most of the Catholic press and publishing operations of the Grand Duchy. Always a conservative and an ultramontanist, he criticized Freemasons, the liberals, the Kulturkampf, anything that threatened the Catholic Church. Some of his editorials annoyed the Prime Minister, F√©lix Baron de Blochausen, a Liberal, so much that the priest got thirty days in jail in 1880. But he also won on 14 June 1881 a seat with the Chamber of Deputies of the Grand Duchy to represent the canton of Clervaux ( , ) in northern Luxembourg. However, to claim his seat, he had to be given the honorable discharge on 21 September 1881 from his parish because his new career was not compatible with his old career. He moved to the capital, Luxembourg City, where he supported the Catholic Right party for six years, from 1881 to 1888. Because of his activities, Fallize was appointed in 1884 by the new Bishop of Luxembourg, Johannes Joseph Koppes, as the economus (responsible for the finances and logistics) and general vicar of the Diocese of Luxembourg. In the following year, he also founded the Sankt- Paulus Publications (now Saint-Paul Luxembourg ) to publish magazines and pamphlets in the support of the Catholic Church. He also became the editor of a national daily, the Luxemburger Wort (now d'Wort ), and he served in this position for two years, until 1887. On 6 February 1887, because of his successes in both media and politics, Fallize was named by Pope Leo XIII as the second Prefect Apostolic of Norway as well as the Protonotary Apostolic and the Prelate of the Papal Chambers.  The Bishop of Norway  Fallize arrived in Christiania (now Oslo ) three months later, on 18 May 1887, to begin his term. As the saying goes, he went from a big fish in a small pond to a small fish in a big pond. It had been 350 years since the Reformation chased the Catholic bishops and priests out of Norway but the priests had already been ministering in Christiania since 1843 and Bergen since 1854. They were joined in 1869 by the first Prefect Apostolic, Bernard Bernard, a Frenchman. When Fallize succeeded him, there were only 800 believers and 16 priests in just 4 parishes and most of them were foreigners in the cities. With characteristic energy and efficiency, Fallize, assisted by a group of priests imported from Luxembourg, set out to organize a Catholic community throughout Norway. He founded parishes, schools, hospitals and associations and built eight new churches. He introduced Roman Liturgy and Gregorian chants. He travelled extensively throughout his vast diocese, from Kristiansand to Svalbard, and, in his visits to other countries, he raised funds for his diocese. In 1889, his second year in Christiania, he founded the weekly Catholic magazine, St. Olaf Katholsk tidende [ St. Olav Catholic Magazine ], and the St. Olafs Trykkeri [ St. Olaf Publications ] and, four years later, he had more than 50 titles published in Norwegian. In 1901, he created the Franciscan Sisters [ Franciskuss√∏stre ], a congregation of nuns named in honor of St. Francis Xavier, to look after his hospitals and schools. He was so active that, whenever the Lutherans of Norway thought of the Catholic Church at all, they saw two faces ‚Äì Fallize and the Pope. Although he was Luxembourger, Fallize was loyal to his adopted country. He placed a great importance on Norwegian patriotism and praised the Norwegian ways of democracy and tolerance. He wrote books and articles about Norway for his readers in Luxembourg, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. To his former newspapers, the Luxembourg Wort, he sent 24 letters about Norway between 1887 and 1898. In 1913, he ensured that the Vatican would be the first to recognize the Norwegian sovereignty over Svalbard and added the archipelago's German name, \\"Spitsbergen\\", to his episcopal titles. He was even naturalized as a citizen of Norway on 22 April 1891 ‚Äì with a new and properly Norwegian name ‚Äì Johannes Olav Fallize, in the honor of his adopted country's patron saint, St. Olav. Six years later, in 1897, for the first time since the Reformation, the feast of St. Olav was celebrated in Trondheim. \\"Norway\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume 11, edited by Pius Wittman (New York City : Robert Appleton Co., 1911), no page listed, retrieved 9 January 2014. But Fallize was not without faults. He was strong, sharp and intelligent, a good businessman and administrator, but, as he often proclaimed from the pulpit, \\"I cannot tolerate contradictions! [ Jeg t√•ler ikke motsigelser! ]\\"Langslet, \\"Johannes Olaf Fallize\\", Norsk Biografisk Leksikon He was a shepherd of the old school, who demanded total obedience in the name of the Church, so he got into conflict with just about everyone ‚Äì the people, the sisters, the civil authorities and even the Vatican. He would give his priests detailed instructions on everything, including clothes, sports (he did not want them in sports) and bicycles. He told the Catholic parents to send their children to Catholic schools only under the threat of excommunication, even as the Vatican pleaded him to keep a softer line. But Fallize also had failures. The Constitution of 1814 had enshrined the ban against \\"the Jesuit and other monkish orders\\" for all of Norway. Bernt T. Oftestad, \\"Norway and the Jesuit Order : A History of Anti-Catholicism\\", in: Yvonne Marie Werner and Jonas Harvard, editors, European Anti-Catholicism in a Comparative and Transnational Perspective ( Amsterdam and New York City : Editions Rodopi B.V., 1994), , page 210. \\"Norway Ends Ban of Jesuits\\", Catholic Herald, London, England, United Kingdom, 16 November 1956, page 5, column 10. In 1894, Fallize tried to persuade the Storting [ Parliament ] of Norway to lift the ban against the Jesuits by writing and publishing a pamphlet, Munken og Jesuiterne : Apologetisk Afhandling [ Monks and Jesuits : Apologetic Essay ], in which he debunked the myths about the Jesuits and explained the misunderstandings about their doctrines and practices.Oftestad, op. cit., page 215. The Storting refused ‚Äì for the next three years. In 1897, \\"other monkish orders\\" were allowed to enter Norway but the Jesuits had to wait until 1956.Oftestad, op. cit., page 220. Nevertheless, Fallize was so successful in his endeavors that, on 11 March 1892, Pope Leo XIII was able to upgrade the status of Norway to \\"Apostolic Vicariate\\", promoting Fallize to the rank of Vicar Apostolic. Although he was still the head of the Catholic Church of Norway, the new title did not have the gravity and authority of a regular bishop so, on 19 March 1892, he was consecrated as the Titular Bishop of Elusa. The ceremony was performed in Rome by Paul Ludolf Cardinal Melchers, the former Archbishop of Cologne, with the assistance of Archbishop Tancredo Fausti and Bishop Victor- Jean-Joseph-Marie van der Branden de Reeth. So Fallize was effectively the first Catholic bishop ever to govern Norway since the Reformation. On 18 May 1912, Fallize was awarded the Commander of the Order of St. Olav for his philanthropic activities and his writings about Norway. 23 days later, on 31 May, Pope Pius X made him an Assistant to the Throne of St. Peter and a Papal Count of Rome for his missionary efforts and achievements in growing the Catholic Church in Norway.  Retirement  Portrait from the Archbishop's tombstone at St. Nicholas Cemetery in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. On 21 June 1922, Fallize was allowed to resign from all his duties in Norway. Old age and illness were given as the official reasons but one of the biographers believed that his resignation was made at the request of the Vatican, which had found him \\"a little too willful\\" and difficult. However, he had made the Catholic Church bigger, better and stronger in Norway, with about 2,600 believers (in 1920) in ten parishes, so, for that, he was made the Titular Archbishop of Chalcis in Graecia on 9 October 1922. He stayed in Bergen for the next two years but, on 25 April 1924, he moved back to Luxembourg, where he retired to the convent of St. Zita in Luxembourg City. He died there on 23 October 1933 at the age of 89. With a funeral at the Cathedral of Our Lady in Luxembourg City, he was buried at St. Nicholas Cemetery ( , ) in the Limpertsberg quarter in the same city on 31 October 1933.  Works  Fluent in five languages ‚Äì German, French, Norwegian, Latin and Dutch, Fallize was more than just an editor and publisher of newspapers and a copywriter for calendars. He also penned poems, editorials, lectures, reports, memoirs, travelogues but his subjects were not limited to the Catholic Church, Norway and Luxembourg. Father Martin Blum, \\"Litterarische Arbeiten von Johann Baptiste Fallize [ Literary Works of Johann Baptiste Fallize ]\\", Om H√©mecht : Organ des Veriines f√ºr Luxemburger Geschichte, Litteratur und Kunft [ Our Homeland : Organ of the Association of Luxembourger History, Literature and Culture ], Volume 4, No. 6 (1 June 1898), pages 329‚Äì331; Volume 4, No 8 (1 August 1898), pages 395‚Äì400, for a complete list of the Archbishop Fallize's publications. Between 1864 and 1869, when he was still a student at the Ath√©n√©e, Jean-Baptiste created about a hundred poems, in all styles ranging from ghazals to sestinas, about certain aspects of his homeland ‚Äì the Moselle River, Vianden, emigration to America (his brother Philippe-Michel had gone to America), and others, including the Blessed Virgin Mary.Conter, \\"Fallize\\", Dictionnaire des Auteurs Luxembourgeois. But, after 1870, he switched to travelogues. He wrote about his university years in Rome in Eine Reise nach Rom [ A Journey to Rome ], published in the first volume of the Luxemburger Volksbibliothek [ Luxembourger People's Library ], a series of Christian literature he had founded to be read daily at home. When he was in Norway, Johannes Olav wrote long travel stories, which were translated into German, Norwegian and Portuguese, and descriptions of wildlife, cities, villages and landscapes. He published four books about his trips in the Land of the Midnight Sun, three in French ‚Äì Tourn√©e pastorales en Norv√®ge [ Pastoral Tour of Norway ] in 1895, Promenades en Norv√®ge in 1900 and Excursions en Norv√®ge et chez les Lapons [ Excursions in Norway and with the Lapps ] in 1912 ‚Äì and one in Dutch, Verkenningstochten in Norwegen [ Expeditions in Norway ] in 1904. He also edited Papal letters and directives in a book, Kirkelige Bekjendtgj√∏relser [ Ecclesiastical Announcements ], as well as works of edification and school textbooks. He also contributed to magazines such as Katholische Missionen in Freiburg im Breisgau, Les missions catholiques in Lyon and St. Olav Katholsk tidende in Christiania. Altogether, his publications totaled more than 50 titles. One of them is Der kleine Jesus als Applicant, a jubilee pamphlet published in Norwegian in 1895 and German in 1898 to encourage the Catholic youth to become priests, monks and nuns.  Legacy  There is a monument honoring Fallize, with an accompanying chapel, on the spot of the former tannery, where his father once worked, in the valley of the B√´tlerbaach ( ), on the Belgian border.

For instance, Female competition in Japan includes promotions such as DEEP Jewels. Now defunct promotions that featured female fighters were Valkyrie, and Smackgirl. Professional mixed martial arts organizations in the United States that invite women to compete are industry leader Ultimate Fighting Championship, the all female Invicta Fighting Championships, Resurrection Fighting Alliance, Bellator Fighting Championships, and Legacy Fighting Championship. Now defunct promotions that featured female fighters were Strikeforce and EliteXC. There has been a growing awareness of women in mixed martial arts due to popular female fighters and personalities such as Megumi Fujii, Gina Carano, Cristiane \\"Cyborg\\" Santos, Ronda Rousey, Miesha Tate, Holly Holm and Joanna Jƒôdrzejczyk and among others. Carano became known as \\"the face of women's MMA\\" after appearing in a number of EliteXC events. This was furthered by her appearances on MGM Television's 2008 revival of their game show American Gladiators. The UFC's decision to allow female fighters in the organization, to promote the dominant fighter Ronda Rousey, is often cited as the reason women's mixed martial arts became known to the general public. Rousey won the Best Fighter ESPY Award at the 2015 ESPN ESPY award's, beating out noted fighters such as Floyd Mayweather Jr., and becoming the first UFC and MMA fighter to win the award. History In Japan, female competition has been documented since the mid-1990s. Influenced by female professional wrestling and kickboxing, the Smackgirl competition was formed in 2001 and became the only major all-female promotion in mixed martial arts. Other early successful Japanese female organizations included Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling, ReMix (a predecessor to Smackgirl), U-Top Tournament, K-Grace, and AX. =United States= In the United States, prior to the success of The Ultimate Fighter reality show that launched mixed martial arts into the mainstream media, there was little major coverage of female competitions. Some early organizations who invited women to compete included, International Fighting Championships, SuperBrawl, King of the Cage, Rage in the Cage, Ring of Combat, Bas Rutten Invitational, and HOOKnSHOOT. The first recorded US female competition was at an IFC 4 on March 28, 1997. This was soon followed by an IFC four women tournament sanctioned by the Louisiana Boxing and Wrestling Commission on September 5, 1997 in Baton Rouge. From the mid-2000s, more coverage came when organizations such as Strikeforce, EliteXC, Bellator Fighting Championships, and Shark Fights invited women to compete. Zhang Weili of China became the first ever women's Strawweight champion after knocking out then Strawweight champion, Jessica Anderade of Brazil in 34 seconds in round number one at UFC Fight Night 157 where she became the first ever women's champion from China. She'd go onto fight Joanna Jedrzejczyk of Poland on March 16hth in Las Vegas, where Weili Zhang won via split decision. Jessica Anderade of Brazil, then still the Strawweight champion fought then underdog, Zhang Weili defeated Anderade in 42 seconds of the first round at UFC Fight Night 157. Following Zuffa's acquisition of Strikeforce in March 2011, there has been much speculation concerning the future of women's competition, in term both of relevance and popularity. The next step was for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to pick up women's MMA, however UFC President Dana White was resistant. He has said, \\"There is not enough depth to create a women's division.\\" However, Dana White warmed up to the idea of including women in the UFC and solely credits Ronda Rousey as the reason women are fighting in the UFC. =Europe and Japan= Outside Japan and the United States, female competition is almost exclusively found in minor local promotions. However, in Europe some major organizations have held select female competitions, including It's Showtime, Shooto Europe, Cage Warriors, and M-1 Global. Africa Africa's first female professional mixed martial arts bout was held in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2015. South Africa's Danella Eliasov defeated Zita Varju ( Hungary) by first round submission. Rule differentiation The traditional MMA rules have often been adjusted for female competitions because of safety concerns. In Japan, ReMix prohibited ground-and-pound and featured a 20-second time limit for ground fighting. This rule remained following ReMix's 2001 re-branding as Smackgirl, though the time limit was extended to 30 seconds. The rule was abolished in 2008. In the United States, women's bouts organised by EliteXC saw three-minute rounds while those of Strikeforce were originally of two minutes' duration. These lengths compare to the more usual five minutes for men. Strikeforce later changed this rule to allow for five- minute rounds. Another form of rule differentiation is a change in both weight limits and weight classification. This has been seen in a number of organizations including, Strikeforce, Smackgirl, and Valkyrie. While men are required to wear a groin protector, women are forbidden from doing so. Women must wear a top and chest protector, while men are allowed neither. Milestones First female MMA fight in United States held on March 28, 1997 by the International Fighting Championships between Becky Levi and Betty Fagan. Strikeforce became the first major promotion in the United States to have held a female fight as the main event on August 15, 2009. The fight between Gina Carano and Cristiane Santos, known professionally as Cris Cyborg, attracted 856,000 viewers. Santos made history with her victory over Carano as she became the first Strikeforce Women's 145 lb Champion. Invicta Fighting Championships in early 2012 became one of the first major women's pro mma organisations. Ronda Rousey became the first woman fighter signed to the UFC on November 2012, and was promoted to the division's bantamweight champion. She successfully defended her title in the first UFC women's fight against Liz Carmouche at UFC 157. Miesha Tate and Cat Zingano fought at the Ultimate Fighter 17 Finale on April 13. On December 11, 2013 the UFC picked up the contracts of 11 female fighters to fill up their 115-pound division. The Strawweights took part in the 20th season of The Ultimate Fighter, the season winner will be the first UFC women's strawweight champion. Some of the fighters include Felice Herrig, Claudia Gadelha, Tecia Torres, Bec Hyatt, Joanne Calderwood, and even Invicta FC's Strawweight Champion Carla Esparza and many more. Carla Esparza became the first UFC strawweight champion after defeating Rose Namajunas at The Ultimate Fighter: A Champion Will Be Crowned finale. Esparza lost her title to Joanna Jƒôdrzejczyk at UFC 185. Disagreement Since its inception the role of women in mixed martial arts has been a subject of debate. Some observers have treated women's competition as a spectacle and a taboo topic.

BAli-Phy achieves high accuracy in alignment estimation by using information from the co-estimated phylogeny. BAli-Phy takes alignment uncertainty into account while estimating the phylogeny by averaging over possible alignments. Unlike most phylogeny inference software, input sequences need not be aligned beforehand. This differs from traditional approaches to alignment and phylogeny estimation, which first estimate the alignment without a high-quality tree estimate, and then estimate the tree given the alignment. BAli-Phy produces a Bayesian posterior distribution on both the alignments and the tree. The software shows uncertainty in both the alignment and the tree. BAli-Phy uses Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimation. It can take several days to run.  Alignment uncertainty  Alignment uncertainty stems from two main sources: near-optimal alignments and evolutionary parameter uncertainty. Evolutionary parameters include branch lengths, substitution rates, insertion/deletion rates, and the phylogeny itself. If the exact value for these parameters is unknown, and the alignment estimate is sensitive to the parameter, then the alignment cannot be known with confidence. Even when evolutionary parameters are fully known, many different alignments may be optimal, or nearly optimal. In this case, the researcher cannot have confidence in any single alignment, but must average over the cloud of near-optimal alignments. BAli-Phy can handle both near-optimal alignment uncertainty and evolutionary parameter uncertainty by integrating over possible alignments and parameter values.  Input and output  BAli-Phy accepts nucleotide, amino acid, and codon sequences in FASTA format. Input sequences need not be aligned. Ambiguous nucleotides such as R and Y are supported, as are the ambiguous amino acids B, Z, and J. Trees are output in Newick format. Alignments are output in FASTA format.

It is the most complete remaining farm complex in the town, and is also notable for its long association with the locally prominent Towne family, which owned the surviving farmland and surrounding land from 1777 until the 1930s. The was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. John Towne first came to Boxford, then a rural agricultural town, in 1777, buying half of a parcel of land belonging to his brother-in-law. He lived in the c. 1756 house on the property until 1790, when his son built the current farmhouse; the old house was demolished. Towne died in 1830, at which time his property passed to his son Samuel. Samuel sold the farmstead and to his son Henry in 1845. These three generations of Townes appear to have been subsistence farmers, although Henry appears to have supplemented his income by engaging in the manufacture of shoes. Henry Towne sold the property (now ) to his son Hiram, who was principally in the lumbering business, but continued to maintain the farm. It is during his ownership that a number of the surviving outbuildings were built: a windmill and water tower were built in the first decade of the 20th century, but a henhouse, cottage, and camp house have not survived. He also made some modifications to the farmhouse, adding bay windows and a single story porch to its front. Hiram Towne died childless in 1932, and the farm was transferred out of the family two years later. Much of the Towne's land was given to the state, and forms part of Boxford State Forest. The farm portion went through a succession of owners in the 20th century, during which time additional neighboring parcels were sometimes added to the property. One large tract () was sold in 2001 to a conservation organization, and others have been subdivided for residential development. In 2009 the farm complex and about of land were acquired by i-Farm LLC, which has been working to restore the farm to working order.

Originally founded as Roxbury High School, the school was situated at 26 Townsend Street, in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States from 1926 until its closure in 1960. History Roxbury High School (for boys) was established in 1852, in what was then the independent City of Roxbury, Massachusetts on Kenilworth Street. In 1854, Roxbury High School for Girls opened, and in 1861, both schools were united into a single co-educational school. The City of Roxbury was annexed by the City of Boston in 1868, and the administration of Roxbury High School was assumed by Boston Public Schools. In order to \\"abolish coeducation and the elective system in all high schools\\", in 1911 the school committee voted to make the Roxbury High School exclusive to girls. In 1926, the school moved from its second home on Warren and Montrose Streets (thereafter housing the Boston Clerical School) to a new building on Townsend Street and became known as the Memorial High School. Prior to being erected, the Townsend Street building had been named as such in 1925 by members of the Boston School Committee \\"in commemoration of the Boston schoolmen who lost their lives during the World War\\". The school building was built in two phases, a girls' portion completed with classes started for the 1926-27 school year, and a boys' half completed with classes started in September, 1928. The two halves were treated as separate institutions, Memorial High School for Boys and Memorial High School for Girls, both with its own headmasters and set of teachers. The school was the first in the City of Boston to feature a swimming pool. Prior to the 1929 school year, the name of the school was changed to the Roxbury Memorial High School.The Warren Branch of the Boston Public Library (BPL) moved to the building in 1926 and was renamed the Memorial Branch. In December 1970, the branch relocated to the corner of Warren and Crawford Streets and dubbed the Grove Hall Branch of the BPL. The school closed in 1960. The building was later occupied by Boston Technical High School from 1960 to 1987, and since 1991 by Boston Latin Academy. Headmasters * BOYS ** Robert B. Masterson (1928‚Äì1953) ** Paul B.

In 1869, construction began for a purpose-built school building, located on Newton Street between Tremont and Shawmut Avenue. That building was designed for just under 1000 students, with 8 classrooms, 15 recitation rooms, 3 studios, chemical, physical, and botanical laboratories, and a hall, as well as facilities dedicated to the Girls' Latin School. This building was formally dedicated on April 19, 1871. By 1903, the high school's share of this space was described as insufficient in the Boston Globe. The school became coeducational in the latter half of the 20th century. By spring 1974, the school housed 500 female students and 200 male students.

Description Acropora millepora is a small colonial coral that grows in clumps. The short branches are cylindrical. The radial corallites are all the same size and have projecting lower rims, giving them a scale-like appearance. The colour is variable and may be green with orange tipped branches, or pale pink, orange, plain green or blue. Distribution and habitat Acropora millepora is a common species and is found in the western and central Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from the Red Sea, Kenya and South Africa to India, Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and Australia. This coral grows in shallow water, between two and twelve metres (six and forty feet) deep, mostly on reef flats, but also on upper reef slopes and in lagoons. Ecology Acropora millepora is a zooxanthellate species of coral and harbours symbiotic dinoflagellates in its tissues. The larvae of Acropora millepora preferentially settle on vertical surfaces and on encrusting coralline algae. It has been found that at lower temperatures () the larvae were less specific as to their choice of settlement sites and that their survival rates were lower. Surprisingly, the choice of substrate for settlement was modified by the strain of symbiont present in the locality even though it had not yet infected the tissues. Status The main threat affecting Acropora millepora is the destruction of the coral reefs where it lives. Although relatively common it is a shallow water species and susceptible to bleaching and coral diseases. It is also collected for the reef aquarium trade. Corals in general are expected to be impacted by rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification. For these reasons, the IUCN has listed Acropora millepora as being \\"Near Threatened\\".

This case has remained unsolved.  Background  The person posing himself as Mon Singh or Mohan Singh had placed a classified advertisement in the 17 March 1987 issue of The Times of India, asking for \\"Dynamic Graduates for Intelligence Officers Post and Security Officers Post\\". Applicants were told to report to the hotel Taj Intercontinental between 10 am and 5 pm the next day. He rented an office at Mittal Towers in Nariman Point to interview the candidates. Singh selected at least 26 candidates and asked them to report to the Taj the following day and were briefed about the 'mock raid' by Singh. They arrived at the Opera House branch of Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri & Sons Jewellers around 2:15 pm. Singh introduced himself to the owner, Pratap Zevari, and produced a 'search warrant'. He ordered the owners to turn off CCTV cameras and surrender a licensed revolver held on the premises. Singh and the fake contingent of Central Bureau of Investigation officers did not allow any phone calls and took samples of ornaments for assessment of the quality of the gold. Singh picked 'samples' of jewellery and had them sealed in polybags. Cash was also collected. After 45 minutes Singh asked two men to put the briefcases in the bus. He asked others to keep watch on the shop and left in the bus to 'supervise' another raid. After about an hour, the owners called the Bombay Police.  Investigation  Police investigation revealed that he booked room number 415 at the Taj on 17 March and he put an advertisement in the newspaper. Police found that Singh reached the hotel after leaving the jewellery shop and hired a taxi from there. The taxi dropped him at Vile Parle where he hired an auto. He was last seen there and there was no trail. The police put out a nationwide alert. They sent a team to Kerala as his hotel record showed that he hailed from Trivandrum.

Biography  Addison was born in Adelaide in 1885. Between 1906 and 1911, she won numerous titles at the tennis championships of Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. She was champion of South Australia in 1906 and from 1908 to 1911. In 1909 and 1911, she won the title at the Victorian championship. In 1910, she won all three events ‚Äì singles, doubles and mixed doubles ‚Äì at the championships of New South Wales. In 1911, she could defend her singles title at Sydney again. By 1910, Addison lived at Melbourne. In late 1913, Addison started nursing training at the Melbourne Hospital which she finished in early 1917. Her brother J.J., also a successful tennis player, was killed in action in Northern France in May 1915. In August 1917, she enlisted in the Australian Army Nursing Service and served in British military hospitals in Salonika, Greece. Because of lung problems, she was transferred to the 3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital at Dartford in February 1919. In England, Addison took the chance to play at the 1919 Wimbledon Championships. In singles, she lost her second round match against Winifred McNair. In mixed doubles, partnering Max D√©cugis, she could reach the semifinals where the pair was stopped by Dorothea Lambert Chambers and Albert Davis Prebble. After the tournament, Addison returned to Australia. She was selected into the Victorian tennis team to play against New South Wales in November 1919. In 1921, she worked at Melbourne Hospital again, but was able to win the Victorian championships for a last time. In 1924, she played at the Australasian Championships. In doubles, she lost the first round 4‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 partnering J. Hope. In singles, she retired before the match against Edith Johnson. Addison nursed at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 1937. By 1940, she had returned to Melbourne and lived at Mont Albert. In 1972, she is recorded as living in Kew. Addison, who apparently never married, died at an age of 96 in 1982.

Despite Earle's broad success with elevating the quality level of the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra, he has publicly criticized the local government for its lack of support. In an interview with Vladislav Davidzon, editor of The Odessa Review, he explained that the orchestra was forced to be self-sufficient in the face of a lack of support: \\"We even did dental work for wind players so that they could continue to play fifteen years ago. It turned out to be a very important issue, I had one horn player who had a number of teeth pulled by an idiot dentist and so he could not put his dentures in and was completely unable to play. We were very fortunate and found a French-Swiss dentist who told us he could fix this. Our man is still playing the horn, his son is our principal horn player. While we were at it, we decided to do the same for all the other wind players as they all had serious dental issues.\\" His festival credits include the Bregenz, Budapest, and Lugano Spring Festivals as well as Perth International and Nuits Musicales du Suquet in Cannes, among others. At the Greek National Opera in Athens, he conducted new productions of The Snow Queen and Don Quixote. While conducting the State Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation in Moscow he received a message on June 27, 2013 that the President of Ukraine had signed a decree naming him People's Artist of Ukraine. Thereafter he had an interview with Kyivan American Embassy where he talked about his friendship with Bohdan Stupka. Earle speaks seven languages.

It provides free independent advice and support to people affected by medical accidents (lapses in patient safety) through a specialist helpline, written casework and inquest support services. It also works in partnership with health professionals, the NHS, government departments, lawyers and, most of all patients, to improve patient safety and justice (in the widest sense) for people affected by medical accidents. AvMA is a registered charity in England & Wales (No: 299123) and in Scotland (No: 2239250). History AvMA was originally established in 1982 as ‚ÄòAction for the Victims of Medical Accidents‚Äô following public reaction to the television play ‚ÄòMinor Complications‚Äô, by AvMA‚Äôs founder, Peter Ransley. The name was changed in 2003 to ‚ÄòAction against Medical Accidents‚Äô. Since its inception, AvMA has provided advice and support to over 100,000 people affected by medical accidents, and succeeded in bringing about massive changes to the way that the legal system deals with clinical negligence and in moving patient safety higher up the agenda in the UK. The legal reforms of Lord Woolf and the creation of agencies such as the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) and Commission for Health Audit and Inspection (now the Care Quality Commission) followed years of AvMA raising these issues and campaigning. AvMA is also responsible for making clinical negligence a specialism within legal practice, and continues to accredit solicitors for its specialist panel and promote good practice through comprehensive services to claimant solicitors. In 2000, AvMA‚Äôs first chief executive, Arnold Simanowitz, was awarded the OBE in recognition of his achievements with AvMA. In 2003 the current chief executive, Peter Walsh was appointed and the charity was relaunched under the new name Action against Medical Accidents. AvMA helped scores of families affected by the Stafford Hospital scandal, campaigned for the public inquiry which eventually happened, and were a core participant in the inquiry. AvMA are extensively quoted in Sir Robert Francis QC‚Äôs report and most of AvMA‚Äôs suggestions were taken up in his recommendations. Most notably, AvMA‚Äôs arguments for a statutory duty of candour were supported by Sir Robert. Campaigns Duty of Candour: In January 2014 David Behan, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, threw his weight behind a wide definition for the statutory duty of candour which was recommended by the Francis Report. The statutory duty of candour now applies to all health care organisations in England which are registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), and is under consideration in Wales and Scotland. Access to Justice: When something goes wrong and causes harm, it is vital that patients or their families are dealt with fairly and honestly and can get the support, answers and outcomes they are entitled to expect. AvMA campaigns to remove barriers to access to justice.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Lo√überg was instrumental in conceiving the concept of Zahme Sau (\\"Tame boar\\"), a night fighter tactic of the Luftwaffe. Career Lo√überg was born on 14 March 1904 in Posen, present-day Pozna≈Ñ in Poland, at the time in the Province of Posen, a province of the Kingdom of Prussia in the German Empire. He joined the military service of the Wehrmacht in late 1933 at Braunschweig. The Treaty of Versailles signed after World War I had prohibited Germany from having an air force. Before the Luftwaffe was unveiled in 1935 he was trained as a pilot at civilian flight schools.Kaiser 2011, p. 26. Lo√überg was involved in the testing and evaluation of various aircraft for use as night fighters. Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch favored the conversion of aircraft like the Junkers Ju 88 or Junkers Ju 188 because it did not influence production numbers. Josef Kammhuber preferred the new Heinkel He 219. The Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM‚ÄîReich Air Ministry) ordered a comparison test which was held 25‚Äì26 March 1943 at Rechlin. Lo√überg was ordered to fly the Ju 188 E-1 in mock combat against the He 219 piloted by Werner Streib. The test proved the He 219 to be superior to the Ju 188.Remp 2000, pp. 54‚Äì55. Lo√überg played a significant role in the development and introduction of the Zahme Sau night fighter system in mid-1943, which began the recovery of the German night defences against the increasing size of attacks by Royal Air Force Bomber Command and eventually replaced the Himmelbett (canopy bed) of the Kammhuber Line. In the introductory phase of Zahme Sau, Lo√überg flew 39 night fighter missions from airfields operated by I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1. In total he flew 39 missions without claiming any victories.

The low budget picture was financed partly by Herman Schueremans, organizer of the Flemish rock festival Rock Werchter. The film was named after a 1979 song by Raymond van het Groenewoud, who also wrote the soundtrack for the movie. Brussels by Night was important in Belgian film history because its bleak, grey atmosphere and stream of consciousness structure were a sharp contrast with the more conventional films the country produced up to then.  Plot  Brussels 1983. Max, an assassin, is seriously depressed. He tries to commit suicide by sticking a gun in his mouth, but when the gun jams he cries nevertheless. We follow him as he travels through Brussels without any goal and provokes everyone he meets. His mood changes at the most unpredictable moments.

Published in the Urdu literary journal Adab-i-Latif, it led to much controversy, uproar and an obscenity trial, where Ismat had to defend herself in the Lahore Court as well for this work. She was asked to apologize which she did not and also won the case, after her lawyer pointed out that the story makes no suggestion to a sexual act, and prosecution witnesses could not point out any obscene words, and the story is suggestive and told from perspective of a small girl. In the coming decades it was widely anthologised, and became one of her most known works, besides Angarey which remained banned for several decades. Years later, she mentioned in detail the court trial in her noted memoir, Kaghazi Hai Pairahan (A Life in Words: Memoir). Though it received attention for its suggestion of lesbianism, it also deals with the insulated and suffocating life of a neglected wife in the feudal society. It became a landmark for its early depiction of sex, still a taboo in modern Indian literature, let alone Urdu literature.  Storyline  The story is told from the point of view of a small girl who is the niece of the protagonist, Begum Jan. Begum Jan has had a very depressing life after marriage. Her husband, the Nawab, was much older than her and was thought to be extremely respectable for never having had any encounters with prostitutes. But it is soon revealed that it is because his interests lie in the other gender. The lonely Begum starts to wither but is saved by Rabbo, her masseuse. Rabbo is a servant girl who is not so pretty but very deft with her hands. When the narrator is left at Begum Jan's place by her mother, she realises that despite her past admiration of love for Begum Jan, there lie many secrets with her. At night, the great shadows formed by the quilt of Begum Jan and her odd behavior in the absence of Rabbo bring to light their hidden relationship, traumatising the narrator. In popular culture Fire 1996 Hindi film directed by Deepa Mehta and starring Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das was loosely based on the short story. The short story was adapted to short film by the same name directed by Rohan Sonawane. Bibliography * The Quilt and Other Stories, New Delhi, Kali for Women, 1996.

Ukrainian Heraldry Society. Coat of arms of four counties of Kingdom of Hungary in Carpathian (Bereg, M√°ramaros, Ugocsa, Ung) The coat of arms were created after the end of the First World War, when local councils of Eperjes, Ung, Huszt of the region of Carpathian Ruthenia signed memorandum on leaving the First Hungarian Republic following Bolshevik coup-d'√©tat led by B√©la Kun and joining the newly created state of Czechoslovakia as an autonomous land. The arms was designed by Gustav Friedrich, a head of heraldic commission of the Czechoslovak government. During negotiations with the central government in Prague as the representatives of Ruthenian political elite were not able to arrive to final conclusion, creation of the coat of arms was directed to specialists in heraldry in Prague. A technical task for development of emblem however anticipated, possibly, to consider wish of local political elite of the land. The Rusyn community firmly was standing on positions that were adopted back at the First Slavic Congress in Prague that took place during the 1848 Spring of Nations about the use of \\"Pan-Slavic\\" colors: blue, white, and red, while the supporters of Uniate (Greek Catholic) clergy were standing on position of use blue-yellow colors. Therefore professor Gustav Friedrich presented a compromised decision. That is, by using the four main colors, to offer an emblem \\"with an image of a bear which earlier was depicted on coat of arms of Uzhhorod city\\". The arms is parted per pale show three gold bars on blue field in its first (dexter) field and a red bear rampant on silver in its second (sinister) field. In 1924 Czech professor Ir≈æi Kralj, a specialist of ethnography expressed his opinion that the bear is a symbol for the Carpathian wildlife (fauna). For sometime it was thought that professor Friedrich was mistaken about existence of bear in heraldry of Uzhhorod or its vicinities, yet in 1991 a Polish economist Andrzej Wocia≈Ç who was interested in history of wars proposed a version that bear may have derived from old heraldry of Peter Petrovics coat of arms who was an overlord of Zemplin and Ung in the 14th century. There also was found an old seal from Ung county (megye) belonging to village of Kostrino which starts with inscriptions \\"Ung. M.\\" and then another \\"Kostrina\\". On the Kostrino village seal is depicted a bear rampant. It also should be noted that on the coat of arms of Bereg County is also depicted a bear rampant, but it is a bear rampant to sinister (\\"facing left\\"). The arms were also used by the short-lived state of Carpatho-Ukraine in 1939, but with the addition of the Ukrainian trident in the uppermost blue field, used previously by the Ukrainian People's Republic. The idea of adding the seal of St. Volodymyr the Great came from Dr. Stefan Rosocha, a native of Maramoros. Since the territory is the same for the current Zakarpattia Oblast, the oblast uses the arms as its own.

It is native to the western and central Indo-Pacific where it is found in shallow reef habitats. Like other corals of the genus Acropora, it is susceptible to coral bleaching and coral diseases and the IUCN has listed it as being \\"Near Threatened\\". Description Acropora nasuta is a small colonial coral that grows in clumps which tend to develop flat tops. The branches are tapering and up to wide. The radial corallites usually form neat rows, sometimes being long and slender and sometimes appressed. The axial corallites may be larger or the same size as the radial corallites. The colour of this coral is creamy-white or pale brown and the branch tips are sometimes bluish. File:Acropora nasuta (Hard coral).jpgFish often hide among the branches File:Acropora nasuta Maldives 3.JPGA. nasuta in the Maldives File:Acropora nasuta, isla Johnston.jpgClose up Distribution and habitat Acropora nasuta is a common species and is found in the western and central Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the east coast of Africa to India, Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and Australia. This coral grows in shallow water, between three and fifteen metres (ten and fifty feet) deep, mostly on upper reef slopes and reef edges. Ecology Acropora nasuta is a zooxanthellate coral. This means that it has symbiotic dinoflagellate algae living within its tissues and these employ photosynthesis to make complex carbohydrates from which the coral benefits. Besides this, the coral gets nourishment from the polyps which project from the corallites at night and extend their tentacles to feed on plankton. There are usually barnacles of several species growing on the branches of the coral and certain species of small fish, crabs and shrimps live permanently among the branches. The crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) preferentially feeds on Acropora species corals. Status The main threat affecting Acropora nasuta is the destruction of the coral reefs where it lives. Although relatively common, it is a shallow water species and susceptible to bleaching and coral diseases. It is also collected for the reef aquarium trade. Corals in general are expected to be impacted by rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification. For these reasons, the IUCN has listed Acropora nasuta as being \\"Near Threatened\\".

He established the African Development Center in 2004, which provided microloans and technical expertise to recent immigrant businesses. Personal life Samatar was born in 1964 in Somalia. He grew up in a diverse area in Kismayo, situated in the southern Lower Juba province. Samatar's father had originally moved down from the northeastern Puntland region at the age of twelve, and his mother hailed from the southern town of Afmadow. Samatar attended high school in Mogadishu. He later studied at the local Somali National University, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1991. His initial goal was to work as an economist, but postponed this following the outbreak of the civil war four days after his graduation. Samatar then moved to the United States, part of the first wave of Somali emigrants to Minnesota in December 1991. He learned English with the help of a Minneapolis librarian. Samatar was later accepted at the University of St. Thomas, earning an MBA in Business Administration from the institution. In 2003-2004, he was selected as a Humphrey School of Public Affairs Fellow, and later as a German Marshall Memorial Fellow in 2007. Samatar had also enrolled in the Achieving Excellence in Community Economic Development program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, which he successfully completed. Samatar was married to Ubah Jama, with whom he had four children. On August 25, 2013, Samatar died of complications from leukemia. Career In 2002, Samatar was hired by Wells Fargo into their management training program and became a business banker in 2002. He also worked at Northwest Banks. In 2004, he launched the African Development Center, with assistance from the McKnight Foundation and the Pan- African Community Endowment. The organization's purpose was to provide education and financial services to recent immigrants. In 2009, the ADC had a loan portfolio of $10 million. Samatar later entered public office in 2006, when he was appointed to the Minneapolis Library Board of Trustees by Mayor R.T. Rybak. Four years on, he became the first Somali American in Minnesota and most likely the country to be elected to public office, winning a seat on the Minneapolis School Board. He was inaugurated into the office on 11 January 2011. Samatar also served on the boards of a number of civic and development organizations. Among these were the Citizens League, Dean's Advisory Board of the Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota, CommonBond Communities and Minneapolis Foundation. Additionally, Samatar was actively engaged in politics within Somalia. He often wrote on the domestic political scene, endorsing the Hiil Qaran Party as a possible national party to contest elections in the autonomous Somaliland, Puntland, Khatumo, Galmudug and Himan and Heeb regions. Legacy In a statement after this death, Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak said one of his greatest pleasures as mayor was getting to know Samatar, whom he described as \\"an extraordinary leader and a real friend.\\" Praising Samatar's public work, Rybak also said the city planned to name a re-purposed stretch of 5th Street in Samatar's honour. In 2018, Minneapolis opened the highly anticipated mixed-used pedestrian path, naming it Samatar Crossing, to provide greater connection for Cedar-Riverside area residents and visitors to Hiawatha LRT Trail, downtown Minneapolis, and other city neighborhoods. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey remarked at the dedicated ceremony, ‚ÄúThis [crossing] is an honor to Samatar who worked to bridge communities.

It was the first racially integrated orchestra in the United States. The Symphony gave its debut concert on 6 May 1965 at Carnegie Hall, conducted by Benjamin Steinberg, who said of the orchestra, \\"We have a lot of talent in this city, and we have to create the opportunities to present it to the public\\". The symphony's musicians were graduates of such respected music schools as Juilliard, Eastman School of Music, the Manhattan School of Music, and the New England Conservatory. Its performances were broadcast on the Voice of America and Armed Forces Radio to audiences worldwide. Ebony Magazine pronounced it, \\"for both artistic and sociological reasons, a major development in the musical history of the United States\\". Steinberg continued as music director and conductor until 12 December 1971, when a dispute between him and some of the orchestra's members resulted in his resignation backstage shortly before the start in order for the concert to continue under his baton. Financial difficulties, caused by the general economic situation and by a delay in receiving $100,000 of scheduled grants led to the rest of the 1971-72 concert season being cancelled. The Symphony gave its last concert on Sunday, 9 April 1978.  Founding  In 1940, Steinberg had begun to work with conductors Dean Dixon and Everett Lee to establish the first fully integrated professional symphony orchestra in the U.S. The dream never materialized because of insufficient funds. When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed on July 2, flutist Harold Jones remembers, \\"There was a nucleus of people: Elayne Jones, Harry Smyles, Joe Wilder, Wilmer Wise, Kermit Moore, Lucille Dixon. We all got together and had these meetings. 'Are we interested?' Everyone jumped to the idea. 'Yes. Let's do this. We're going to do it -- have an integrated orchestra.' The standards of the musicians were very high. We had to deal with personnel. Designating the spots to play was a big-time meeting. Benny organized who was going to be first chair, who was going to be second. Then he asked, 'How many concerts would you like to do?' We discussed it, and he took it to heart. Benny went out and got the money. He asked Zero Mostel, who was doing A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum on Broadway at the time.\\" The series of meetings produced the mission statement for the Symphony of the New World, an orchestral expression of the Civil Rights Movement. The name was chosen to reflect the conviction that segregated ensembles were \\"not of today's world\\". The mission statement was written by Benjamin Steinberg as Music Director and 11 founders: Alfred Brown, Selwart R. Clarke, Richard Davis, Elayne Jones, Harold M. Jones, Frederick L. King, Kermit D. Moore, Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, Ross C. Shub, Harry M. Smyles, and Joseph B. Wilder. The goals of The Symphony of the New World were: # To create job opportunities for the many talented non-white classical instrumentalists who have so far not been accepted in this nation's symphony orchestras. # To present qualified conductors and, as a basic responsibility, qualified non- white conductors under professional standards. # To give concerts of the highest artistic and professional standards in communities of low-income families, such as Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem areas of New York City. However, the orchestra will periodically appear in Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, and in many of the city's schools and colleges. # To so establish the Symphony of the New World as to make it our nation's cultural beacon in the eyes of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The orchestra debuted with 36 black and 52 white musicians.Boutwell, Jane, sidebar to Eisler, Edith (1993). \\"Music in the New World: The Manifold Talents of Kermit Moore\\". Strings. Cited in: (subscription required) Beyond the mission statement, the Symphony wanted to integrate the symphonic stage with female musicians, as well; in 1975 the then director said it was 40% black, with most of those being black women. Among the orchestra‚Äôs original sponsors were Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, Paul Creston, Ruby Dee, Langston Hughes, Hershy Kay, Gian Carlo Menotti, Zero Mostel, Ruggiero Ricci, and William Warfield. A gift of $1000 from the Equitable Life Assurance Society, a grant from the fund of Martha Baird Rockefeller, and many small donations from Black supporters provided the initial backing for the Symphony of the New World. Zero Mostel also contributed.  Performances  On 6 May 1965, two months after the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery and exactly three months before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 took effect, the Symphony of the New World performed its debut concert at Carnegie Hall. Soprano Evelyn Mandac sang Francesco Cilea's aria \\"Iu son l'umile ancella\\" from his opera, Adriana Lecouvreur and \\"Depuis le jour\\" from Louise by Gustave Charpentier. Allan Booth was the piano soloist, and Joe Wilder played the trumpet solo for Stravinsky's Petrouchka. Trumpeter Wilmer Wise recalls, \\"Some people were crying because it was something we had dreamt about and it had finally come to fruition. I never felt in my life the way I did when I sat on the stage with Benjamin Steinberg in a fully integrated orchestra ‚Äì because, usually, I was the one integrating it.\\" Gloria Agostini and Harold Jones, artists of the Symphony of the New World, rehearsing for a concert at the Community Church, 40 East 35th Street in New York City, 23 January 1966 George Walker going over his Address for Orchestra with Benjamin Steinberg, director of the Symphony of the New World The program notes stated: > At this period in our history, when the problem of racial integration has > become crucial to our nation's internal well-being as well as to its > position in the world, the debut concert tonight of the Symphony of the New > World is a historic event in the music life of our time. Under the direction > of the noted conductor and music director Benjamin Steinberg, the Symphony > consists of 36 Negro and 52 white musicians. Never before in the musical > history of the nation has such a completely integrated symphonic ensemble > been created. Following its Carnegie Hall debut concert, the Symphony of the > New World will repeat its program in Harlem on Sunday afternoon, May 9, at > the High School of Music and Art, 135th Street and Convent Avenue. This > concert will be the first in the Symphony's long-range plan of performing in > communities of low-income families and in reaching a public outside the > orbit of the traditional concert world. The idea of the symphony has long > been a hope of conductor Steinberg, who has over the past 25 years worked > closely with the American Negro conductors, Dean Dixon and Everett Lee, as > well as with innumerable nonwhite instrumentalists. In May 1964, Mr. > Steinberg and a group of 13 prominent musicians organized a founding > committee to create a symphony in which the principle of racial integration > would find complete expression. It has taken almost one year for this > artistic project to reach fruition. From its inception, the symphony has > maintained a strict policy of accepting only thoroughly trained, top-flight > performers. In creating job opportunities for the many talented nonwhite > instrumentalists who hitherto have not been widely accepted in this nation's > symphony orchestras, the Symphony of the New World aims to serve as an > example of the principle of racial-equality-in-action to musical groups > throughout the country. In the belief that so many of our symphony > orchestras are not of today's world, it has called itself the Symphony of > the New World. The Symphony has been granted tax exempt status by the > Department of Internal Revenue so that tax deductible contributions can be > made to support what may well be the most important culture venture of our > time. On October 11, 1965, Leonard Bernstein wrote to Donald L. Engle, Director of The Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund for Music. > Dear Mr. Engle: It is a pleasure for me to be able to recommend The Symphony > of the New World for a sizable grant. I have not actually heard the > orchestra perform. But I have heard and known Mr. Steinberg, who conducted > one of my theatre works 15 years ago (1950 Broadway production of Peter > Pan). He is extremely able and gifted; and I am sure that under his guidance > the orchestra will flourish. Most important of all, of course, is the > sociological impetus behind the project ‚Äì a truly integrated symphony > orchestra. The success of this project will certainly stimulate more of the > same, and may provide us with our first big step out of the unfair and > illogical situation in which we now find ourselves with the Negro musician. > Respectfully yours, Leonard Bernstein The Symphony received a grant of $5,000 \\"to be matched two for one\\", and was able to raise the required $10,000 with help from American Airlines (which gave $1,000) and the National Endowment for the Arts (which gave $25,000 in 1967); the New York State Council on the Arts undertook to subsidize concerts in low-income New York City neighborhoods. During its lifetime the orchestra was also supported by the Ford Foundation, the Exxon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. Many successful concerts and collaborations followed. James DePreist was the Symphony‚Äôs principal guest conductor. John Hammond was President of the Board of Directors, which included Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, and Zero Mostel. Anderson and Mostel were also patron artists, along with the Modern Jazz Quartet, George Shirley and William Warfield. There were also breakthroughs. Marilyn Dubow, a soloist with the symphony, won a seat in the New York Philharmonic as the first female violinist. Elayne Jones, one of the founders, joined the San Francisco Symphony as its first black woman timpanist. Thinking back on her days with the Symphony of the New World, Jones remembers, \\"The legitimacy of our organization was not acceptable until we had people who were supporting us. We had to have donations to begin to establish as a viable organization and to get union support! We had to begin getting players for this orchestra. All I remember is how complicated it was and what we went through. We had to also deal with those who said it couldn‚Äôt be done.\\" In 1968 the Symphony of the New World performed the premiere of Address for Orchestra, composed by concert pianist and Smith College professor George Walker, at the High School of Music & Art in Harlem. They performed it again the following day at Lincoln Center. In a special concert for Black History Month in 1974, the Symphony premiered Wade Marcus' A Moorish Sonata and also, with Ruggiero Ricci, the 1864 Concerto for Violin and Orchestra by the Cuban composer Joseph White that had been rediscovered by Paul Glass, a professor at Brooklyn College. (subscription required) In a 1969 concert, Mostel occasioned hilarity, including reportedly among the orchestra players, in his conducting debut with Rossini's overture to Semiramide.  End of the orchestra  By 1971, the orchestra and its supporters had great hopes for the season, but the 1971 season was never completed. One of the things Steinberg used to do was ask principal players to sit second chair, so an up-and-coming musician could have a chance to gain experience. Everyone was happy to do it, until one person changed his mind. Two factions emerged. Eventually Steinberg had to resign backstage at Philharmonic Hall just before a concert on 12 December 1971, so the concert could go on. He conducted the concert nonetheless. The dispute went to arbitration, and control of the Symphony of the New World was taken away from Steinberg on 12 June 1972. \\"Egos\\", said Joe Wilder. \\"It was all about egos. I had been very proud to be a member of the orchestra, but I was annoyed at some of the racial overtones to Ben Steinberg‚Äôs resigning.\\" Jazz writer Ed Berger‚Äôs biography of Joe Wilder also quotes founding member and violist Alfred Brown: \\"There were some people ‚Äì not the majority ‚Äì who had a problem with him. Some of them felt the conductor should be black. I was not one of them. I liked him very much. He was very idealistic.\\" On 1 February 1972, Benjamin Steinberg wrote his last fundraising letter. It said: \\"It is with sincere regret that we must advise that, due to an internal controversy as well as unforeseen financial difficulties arising from the current general economic situation, the Symphony of the New World is canceling the rest of the 1971-1972 concert season. Not only have we sustained the economic pinch facing all non-profit cultural institutions this season, but because of the difficulties, some $100,000 in scheduled grants could not be received in time to permit the completion of this concert season.\\" Later that year, after an arbitration process, the symphony regrouped under a new board of directors and new music director Everett Lee, who had been one of the African American guest conductors brought in by Steinberg. Over the following few years, the orchestra persevered with an ambitious series of concerts, making its debut in Washington, D.C., in October 1975 and returning to Carnegie Hall as its home base the same month. In March 1977, a New York Times reviewer praised the performers' \\"technical security\\", judging the twelfth season the orchestra's best. However, funding remained a perennial problem. In February 1975, the orchestra was forced to cancel a scheduled concert for financial reasons. Conductor George Byrd, who had led the symphony in an October 29, 1972, concert, remarked, \\"It seems to me macabre that the Black Panthers find it easier to raise money than the Symphony of the New World.\\" The 1977‚Äì78 season seems to have been the symphony‚Äôs swan song. The New York Times Arts and Leisure section lists a Symphony of the New World concert for Sunday, April 9, 1978, and no dates beyond that. The groundbreaking orchestra seems to have dissolved without fanfare or even an announcement. Despite its inglorious end, the musicians who were part of the Symphony of the New World felt proud to be a part of the project. \\"It built hope where there was very little\\", flutist Harold Jones said. \\"It showed that, as black people, we had paid our dues and we could do it as well as anyone else. It was such a moment in life that I‚Äôm overwhelmed with it. I just wish it could have lasted. The inspiration that this could be done [remains] in all of us.\\" A commemorative exhibit on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Symphony of the New World was held at the New York Public Library in 2014. The orchestra's papers reside at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

They received their name from the incorrect spelling of Whakatu, the Maori name for Nelson. Being bred from the Hallertau hop, they are often semi-correctly referred to as Hallertau hops. Wakatu and Hallertau hops are often interchangeable in beer recipes due to their close ties. History The Wakatu hop variety was created by HortResearch as an attempt to breed a new aroma hop. Female Hallertau Mittlefr√ºh was pollinated by the male of a native New Zealand hop variety. The resultant hop was suited as a dual-purpose hop and was released from HortResearch's Riwaka Research Centre in 1988.Hallertau dual purpose hop data sheet Use in the brewing of beer Because Wakatu is a dual-purpose hop, it can be used in Single Malt and Single Hop (also known as SMaSH) beer recipes with excellent results. Because of the middle road that was taken between this hop possessing high aroma and high alpha rating, it has a slightly lower alpha rating than some other hop varieties, generally in the range of 6%-9%. Put simply, this translates to a lower bittering potential when compared to dedicated bittering hops, but also offers the advantage of being able to contribute aromatics to the beer, to which non-dual-purpose bittering hops aren't so well suited.

An English translation was published in 2017. Summary Syberberg criticises the German post-war culture, and argues that Germans need to revive the cultural expressions found in the works of artists such as Richard Wagner, Friedrich H√∂lderlin and Heinrich von Kleist, an aesthetic tradition which to a large extent has been expulsed from public life since 1945. He argues that the current cultural establishment is dominated by leftists and Jews, who use World War II and the Holocaust in order to ostracise important parts of the German cultural heritage. Reception The book gave rise to an infected debate in German newspapers, known as the \\"Syberberg debate\\", which lasted throughout the summer and autumn of 1990. The liberal press was highly critical of the book and Syberberg's opinions. Hellmuth Karasek of Der Spiegel reviewed the book under the heading \\"Neo-Nazism\\" and condemned both Syberberg as a person and his oeuvre in its entirety. In Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Werner Fuld described the essay as a \\"frontal attack against democracy and art\\". Although critical of the views presented in the book, Susan Sontag and other critics who in the past had praised Syberberg continued to defend his films as great and important works of art.

The project went viral and gained considerable media attention via social media and was published by many international websites, magazinesLa Repubblica Magazine (PRINT), La Merkel nel pantone ce ne fa vedere di tutti i colori (August 10, 2012)Le Monde Magazine (PRINT), Vur sur le Net ‚Äî Affaires Classees (October 26, 2012)The Irish Times Magazine (PRINT), The measure of Merkel (September 14, 2013)To Vima Magazino, (PRINT) 24 Œ†ŒüŒõŒôŒ§ŒôŒöŒó ŒπœÉ Œ§ŒóœÉ (September 25, 2013) and newspapers, including The Guardian, The New York Times, and The Telegraph.  Background  The Pantone Merkel was created as part of the project \\"The Spectacle of the Tragedy\\", a website with collected and repurposed images identifying the politicians who navigate the Eurozone crisis. The project was made as part of van Eekelen's Master of Design at the Sandberg Instituut Amsterdam, and is generally described as a satire of the crisis. The project approaches the Eurozone crisis through a wide variety of disciplines, such as fashion, art, design,Graphic Design Festival Chaumont, Search / Find / Like / Share (May 25 2013, France) journalism, politics,La Repubblica (IPAD), Le Giacche della Merkel (July 22, 2012) and economics. The purpose of The Spectacle of the Tragedy is to generate a platform to reflect on the euro crisis, by \\"[telling] a visual story about the politicians that navigate the Euro crisis\\" and giving readers \\"an insight into their irresponsible behavior\\". The project can be interpreted as an entertaining diversion and commentary on how our European leaders are trying to secure financial security in the eurozone. In contrast to many female celebrities and public figures, Merkel is known for purchasing and repeatedly wearing her own formal clothes. In 2014 the newspaper Bild praised Merkel for attending a formal event in a tunic she had owned since at least 1996.  Imitation  In (online) discussions, the \\"Pantone Merkel\\" is often compared to the \\"Diamond Jubilee Colour Guide\\" by Pantone and Leo Burnett London. The Pantone Merkel has been imitated several times by various parties, including Reuters and the German Bild;[Bild, Merkels Farbenlehre (July 18, 2012) (PRINT) ] it has also been shown in different exhibitionsThe Cultural Centre of Belgrade Search/Find/Like/Share (March 28 2013, Belgrade) West Texas A&M; University, GDFB 2012 (February 22 2012, United States) and lectures.Mezz Breda, Pecha Kucha (February 28, 2013, The Netherlands) The artistic approach of the Pantone Merkel was followed by the Dutch image editor Frank Schallmaier, who reached a large audience in December 2013 with a series of photos called \\"De hand van Hollande\\".

As a 10-year-old in Versailles, Kentucky, she wrote a series of charming essays that were kept in a scrapbook by her mother, Jessie Gregory Hudson. Her daughter Virginia Cleveland Mayne copied the essays in the spring of 1952 before a disastrous attic fire destroyed the originals in October 1952. Virginia succeeded in publishing the essays with the Macmillan Company as O Ye Jigs and Juleps! The book reached the New York Times Bestseller List for 66 weeks and sold over a million copies. Early childhood and education Virginia Cary Hudson was born in Versailles, Kentucky. She attended Margaret Hall School in Versailles, Kentucky as well as the Bristol School in Washington, DC. Both were Episcopal church schools for girls. Personal life Virginia Hudson married Kirtley S. Cleveland on May 7, 1914, in Versailles. They had three children: Virginia, Ann, and Richard. Virginia and Kirtley first lived in Versailles and then in Louisville. In 1938 they took up residence at 1453 St. James Court, in a house designed by George Tachau. Virginia served as secretary and treasurer and then president of the St. James Court Association. Virginia visited her mother's hometown of Cloverport often. Her father, Richard N. Hudson, President of the Louisville, Henderson & St. Louis Railway, built a country home near there overlooking the Ohio river. He and Jessie Gregory Hudson lived in Versailles, then moved to Cloverport, and kept a residence in Louisville as well. Richard N. Hudson died on January 25, 1937 during the Great Flood and Jessie died five years later on January 22, 1942. Kirtley was an owner and trainer of thoroughbred horses, and Virginia traveled with him to racetracks in North America, Cuba, and Mexico. At home Virginia was a feisty president of the St. James Court Association who solved the problem of people parking on the center green by letting the air out of their tires in the dead of night.\\"\\"George Tachau House\\". Domin√©, David. Old Louisville: Exuberant, Elegant, and Alive. 2013. University of Georgia Press. Pages 110-111. Writer Virginia gave talks to the Women's Auxiliary at Calvary Episcopal Church, to adult Sunday classes, and to other women's groups in Louisville. She also preached at the Goodwill Chapel and the Salvation Army Chapel in Louisville. She always wrote out the text of what she wanted to say, a practice she developed as a child with the encouragement of one of her teachers. Thanks to that discipline, her effusive love of writing, and her daughter Virginia's care to preserve everything her mother wrote, extensive writings by Virginia are extant. The essays she had written when she was ten years old were published by Virginia Cleveland Mayne as O Ye Jigs & Juleps! The book became a nationwide bestseller in 1962. The essays include: Sacraments - \\"What you are doing and saying when other people are listening. What you are thinking is your business.\\"; Etiquette at church; Gardening; Education - \\"What you learn in books, and nobody knows you know it but your teacher.\\"; Everlasting life - \\"God gives it to you and you can't get rid of it.\\"; Spring; The library; Personal appearance - \\"Looking the best you can for the money. If you're born pretty that helps also.\\"; An afternoon's stroll; China and religion. 14 editions of the book were published between 1962 and 1996 in English and are held by 1,326 libraries worldwide. They were a charming ten-year-old girl's interpretation of religion, education, spring, and a variety of other topics. A Swiss German translation as Respektlose Betrachtungen eines aufgeweckten Kleinstadtm√§dchens aus dem Amerika der Jahrhundertwende was published in 1968, and a Dutch edition, O gij polka's en perendrups in 1963. A musical, O Ye Jigs and Juleps: a play with music by Don Musselman, was published in 1992 in English and is held by 6 libraries worldwide. The title of the book is inspired by a traditional canticle, sung in English in Episcopal worship, the Benedicite omnia opera Domini. : \\"O ye children of men, Bless ye the Lord, Praise Him and Magnify Him Forever.\\" Virginia's daughter published three more books of her mother's writings: Credos & Quips (1964), held by 313 libraries worldwide; Flapdoodle, Trust & Obey (1966), a collection of Virginia's letters, held by 439 libraries worldwide; and Close Your Eyes When Praying (1968), lessons about the Bible and the people in it, from a woman's point of view. The book is held by 352 libraries worldwide.\\"Hudson, Virginia Cary. OCLC Authorities List.

The Green Party of Mexico joined as a signatory to the agreement on January 28, 2013. The pact's framework is composed of 95 public policy proposals based on three guiding principles: * The strengthening of the Mexican State * The democratization of the economy and politics, as well as the expansion and effective implementation of social rights * The participation of citizens as key actors in the design, implementation and evaluation of public policies. The pact is divided into 5 parts: Vision, Agreements, National Budget Agreements 2013, Work Method, and Commitments for the Reforms.  Signing  The signing of the Pact for Mexico was held on December 2, 2012, one day after the inauguration of the Pe√±a Nieto administration. At the official ceremony held at Chapultepec Castle, guests other than the main signatories included Jes√∫s Murillo Karam, president of the Chamber of Deputies; Ernesto Cordero Arroyo, president of the Senate of the Republic; the parliamentary coordinators of the various parties of the houses of the Congress of the Union; members of the Mexican Executive Cabinet; state governors; the head of government for the federal district; and the leaders of the Green Party. Agreements The Pact contains five major agreements on different topic areas. These major agreements in turn contain individual agreements that all together add up to 95 commitments. = Achieving a Society of Rights and Freedoms = This first section of the Pact deals with agreements on proposals to address economic and educational inequality, as well as Mexico's positions on human rights.  Addendum  On May 7, 2013, Pe√±a Nieto and the leaders of the three largest national political parties ‚Äì C√©sar Camacho Quiroz of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Gustavo Madero Mu√±oz of the National Action Party, and Jes√∫s Zambrano Grijalva of the Party of the Democratic Revolution ‚Äì signed an addendum to the Pact with two parts containing eleven additional proposals.  Results  The Pact has so far resulted in the passage of an education reform bill, a legal reform bill, and a telecom reform bill. An energy bill was also completed after the Party of the Democratic Revolution left the Pact in November 2013. = Education Reform = In February 2013, education reform outlined in the Pact for Mexico and written into the Official Journal of the Federation entered into force. The February reforms included laying out the composition, selection, and governance processes of Mexico's national education evaluation system, as well as introducing a competitive process for the hiring, promotion, recognition, and tenure of teachers, principals, and administrators and declared that all previous appointments that did not conform to the procedures were null.  Reviews  The Pact has been lauded in The Christian Science Monitor as breaking down difficult parliamentary gridlock and leading to needed reforms. Shortly after the Pact was announced, it was criticized as \\"seek[ing] to replace necessary public debate on the future of the nation with back-room negotiations among politicians committing business as usual,\\" by legal scholar John M. Ackerman in Proceso.

Founder of the experimental Gate Theatre Studio in 1925, he staged London's first expressionistic production in the following year. Eventually moving to Hollywood, he established a career as a film actor and director. Life and career Godfrey began his career as a conjuror, clown, actor and director in repertory theatres around the United Kingdom. However, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the standard repertory plays, being himself attracted to the experimental works of American and Continental directors, and the avant-garde playwrights of the 1920s. To stage such plays, he and his wife, the actress Molly Veness, rented a room in Floral Street, Covent Garden, which they were forced to run as a private club since London City Council refused to grant a licence for their \\"theatre\\", which, according to Edna Antrobus, had only \\"one entrance and exit and a rickety wooden staircase\\". The Gate Theatre Studio opened on 30 October 1925, and after staging plays by Moli√®re and Strindberg established its reputation with a production staged in 1926 of Georg Kaiser's From Morn to Midnight, London's first expressionistic production. In 1927 the theatre club moved to Villiers Street, where it reached the peak of its success in the 1930-31 season. Godfrey directed two British films in the early 1930s. In 1936 he directed a production of C. L. R. James's play Toussaint Louverture - The story of the only successful slave revolt in history at the Westminster Theatre.\\"Toussaint L'Ouverture By CLR James\\", Black Plays Archive, National Theatre. Godfrey moved to New York City in around 1937, where he continued to write and produce plays. In 1939, now in Hollywood, he took up directing more permanently. In 1942 he became a dialogue director for RKO and Columbia Pictures. By the late 1940s Godfrey was a prominent director, working on films such as the Errol Flynn vehicles Cry Wolf and Escape Me Never.McNulty, p. 322. In the 1950s he switched to television and directed episodes for a variety of shows. He died on 4 March 1970, at the age of 70.

Adapted from Mildred Cram's 1925 short story \\"Sadie of the Desert\\", the film focuses on a relationship between New York salesgirl Sadie Hermann (Dorothy Mackaill) and subway guard Herb McCarthy (Jack Mulhall), who meet on the subway and become engaged. However, after Sadie receives a promotion, she must choose between her new job and marrying Herb. The cast also includes Charles Murray, Peggy Shaw, Gaston Glass, and Bernard Randall. The film began production in May 1926. Arthur Edeson served as cinematographer, shooting around Central Park in areas like casinos and nightclubs. Distributed by First National Pictures, the film premiered in New York on September 12, 1926. Many publications wrote positively of the film, praising its acting and Santell's direction. Today, it remains unknown if a print of Subway Sadie has survived. Plot Salesgirl Sadie Hermann (Dorothy Mackaill), employed in a New York City fur store, has always dreamed of traveling to Paris. While riding the subway to work one morning, she meets Irish subway guard Herb McCarthy (Jack Mulhall), and the two strike up a conversation before Herb eventually arranges to have them meet at Cleopatra's Needle that Sunday. Herb and Sadie are soon engaged to be married, but as Sadie has been promoted from saleslady to firm buyer she must cancel the wedding date to sail to Paris for the job, saddening Herb. Sadie prepares to leave, but then receives a message from Herb, which informs her that he is in the hospital as the result of an accident. Sadie chooses to visit him, and she decides to forgo her new job and marry Herb instead, Herb revealing that his father is the president of the subway company. Production Alfred Santell directed Subway Sadie, from a screenplay written by Adele Comandini and Paul Schofield. The pair adapted a short story by Mildred Cram entitled \\"Sadie of the Desert\\", which had first been published in an October 1925 issue of The Red Book Magazine. On May 3, 1926, the film entered production. Santell and Al Rockett, the film's producer and production manager, selected the actors to appear in the film. Jack Mulhall was cast in the lead as Herb McCarthy. Although he had ridden on a subway many times, he did not take notice of the guards, so as preparation for playing the character he rode on a subway for \\"practically an entire day\\" to observe them. Mulhall said of Santell: > That man's a great director. He can make people feel perfectly natural. He's > got what Chaplin did when he directed A Woman of Paris‚Äîhe and Lewis > Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the > new school of directors, it seems to me. They're not so busy thinking about > technique that they have actors turning into marionettes. Chosen to play female lead Sadie Hermann, Dorothy Mackaill opined that the film would appeal to \\"every girl in America\\". She believed that \\"there is not a situation in this picture which could not happen to any girl. That is one of the things I like about it. There is nothing in it that could not be true.\\" The rest of the cast includes Charles Murray as a driver, Peggy Shaw as Ethel, Gaston Glass as Fred Perry, and Bernard Randall portraying Brown. Arthur Edeson served as the cinematographer for Subway Sadie, shooting the silent film in black-and-white. Filming took place at several locations in Central Park, including Cleopatra's Needle and a local casino inn, which marked the first time the location had been filmed. A nightclub scene was also shot in New York. Hugh Bennett served as the film's editor, while Al Rockett Productions produced. Rockett told Motion Picture News in June 1926 that the film had been completed. First National Pictures filed a copyright for the film on August 18, 1926. The finished product was seven reels long, and comprised of film, running for about 70 minutes. Release and reception A scene from the film, featuring Mulhall and Mackaill. Their successful pairing in Subway Sadie led to them appearing in several other films. First National Pictures handled distribution for Subway Sadie, with the film premiering in New York on September 12, 1926. It received positive reviews; a journalist for The New York Times enjoyed the film, calling it \\"an amusing photoplay\\". Although the review branded the ending unsurprising, they described it as \\"nevertheless pleasing\\". The Evening Independent praised the film, lauding it as \\"one of the cleverest and most interesting pictures that has been here this season\\". A review from Photoplay applauded Mackaill's performance and described the film as \\"a true and human story\\". The review in the Motion Picture Herald assessed it as \\"a nice little feature, nothing big, but will go over on bargain nights\\", with praise directed to Mulhall's performance. A Berkeley Daily Gazette review wrote of the film by saying \\"sheer brilliance rarely has been equalled\\" and praised the story, direction, and acting. The Morning Telegraphs review said that Subway Sadie would \\"delight the majority of straphangers\\" and that \\"it is what the boys call excellent box-office\\". The New York American review was similarly positive, describing it as \\"a light but charming comedy\\". In the New York World, the review described the film as \\"a consistently decent affair\\" which featured good direction by Santell. A review in The Daily Mirror wrote positively of Mackaill's performance and complimented Santell's directing abilities, while Reading Eagle praised the performances of the leads, calling them \\"a stellar combination\\". Not all reviews were positive; a negative review came from The Educational Screen, whose reviewer found the film to be \\"pretty trite stuff\\". In June 1927, a Southeast Missourian journalist wrote that the film had since become \\"very successful\\". The pairing of Mulhall and Mackaill was described as \\"such a perfect team\\" that plans to have them star in many further films occurred. Films they appeared in after Subway Sadie include Smile, Brother, Smile (1927), Ladies' Night in a Turkish Bath (1928), Lady Be Good (1928), and Children of the Ritz (1929). The 1933 drama Curtain at Eight marked the final film they appeared in together. Screenings of Subway Sadie occurred as late as January 12, 1928. As of November 2007, it is unclear whether a print of the film exists; it has likely become a lost film. A poster of the film can be seen at the New York Transit Museum.

It was released on 17 January 2014 via Prophecy Productions. The album's name is related to the album's overall concept of shelter, \\"a safe place to escape, this secret thing we all have when life is going too fast and you are full of anxiety.\\" The album marks a significant stylistic shift for the band, fully embracing the band's shoegaze and dream pop influences while eliminating the previous metal influences, with Rolling Stone writing that the album has \\"more in common genetically with Sigur R√≥s than Satyricon.\\"  Musical style, recording and writing  The album's style sees the band delving deeper into their shoegaze influences and \\"leaving metal behind\\" entirely. Rolling Stone compared the album to \\"If the Cocteau Twins discovered a long-lost triplet who had slugged it out in space-pop groups and post-rock bands\\", comparing the style to Slowdive, Mogwai, and Sigur R√≥s. According to AllMusic's Thom Jurek, \\"It is deeply indebted to its '90s British inspirational sources and wholly invested in the melodic sensibilities this group has displayed from the very beginning.\\" Other critics have highlighted the post-rock influence on the album, comparing the closing track 'D√©livrance' to This Will Destroy You, God Is an Astronaut, and similar bands. The concept of the album is encapsulated in the album's title: Shelter. In an interview with Spin, Neige explained that It's just a safe place to escape, this secret thing we all have when life is going too fast and you are full of anxiety\\", adding that \\"This shelter could be anything ‚Äì a person, a movie, music. It's something that reminds you in a way of who you are, like a mirror, and convinces you to get lost.\\" In a separate interview, he explained that \\"We all have things that are helping us. I wouldn't say that I‚Äôm a depressive person because I‚Äôm not, but I can have darker moments, and it really helps me. ‚ÄòShelter‚Äô is about that.\\" Neige found his shelter in the sea, saying \\"I love to spend time by the sea, just having very simple moments disconnected from the stress of everyday life and sitting on the beach and watching the waves.\\" Neige has discussed their choice to work with Birgir J√≥n Birgisson and record the album in Iceland, explaining that previous recording studios specialized in metal, whereas the band were interested in pursuing a different sound on this album. \\"We wanted to change our habits, and to take a bit more risks. On the previous record, we had this very clean, metal sound, very regular.\\" He cited the studio's experience in recording with Sigur R√≥s as a factor in their decision. Neige also explained that \\"Iceland fit well with this concept of Shelter. It is a place that is isolated from everything, and it feels like being in a creative bubble all the time.\\"  Touring and promotion  The band premiered the first single 'Opale' on 29 November 2013 with a music video. In support of the album, the band toured across Europe in early 2014, as well as the United States and Mexico from September‚ÄìOctober 2015 with Emma Ruth Rundle.  Critical reception  Shelter was met with positive reviews from music critics upon its initial release. At Metacritic (a review aggregator site which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from music critics), based on 13 critics, the album has received a score of 76, which indicates \\"generally positive reviews\\". While many critics praised the dreamy atmosphere, guitar textures, and overall beauty of the album's style, the stylistic move away from the band's earlier blackgaze sound was a common point of contention. Exclaim! critic Dean Brown wrote a very positive review of the album, \\"Neige's ever-growing confidence as a songwriter has undoubtedly influenced his songwriting decisions for Shelter. And to call this album a \\"progression\\" for Alcest may be a bit of a leap‚Äîand so too would be calling Shelter a \\"brave\\" album. Shelter is less of a progression and more of a magnification of the beauteous, gentile side of Alcest and a complete suppression of the blackness at the heart of the band.\\" In contrast, Pitchfork contributor Jason Heller argued in his review of the album that \\"Still capable of great feats of mood and beauty, Alcest have transformed themselves, although not always in the best way. They‚Äôve gone from being a remarkably innovative, influential, and singular force in a subgenre they helped create to being just another shoegaze act. That doesn't make Shelter a bad album. As an aural analgesic, it goes down smooth and numbs what it needs to. But instead of tearing open the passageway between this world and whatever lies beyond, it shrinks that portal to the size of a keyhole.\\" By contrast, writer Thom Jurek from AllMusic felt that there wasn't enough progress with their new direction in sound: \\"If there is criticism for Shelter, it's that it sounds as if Alcest are inching rather than stepping forward and stasis has a hold on them; but with the band's catalog as argument, that's deliberate. Musical movement aside, it's a lovely sounding record. Even in its self-conscious worship of shoegaze it could easily become a late addition to that genre's canon. Shelter is well-crafted, vulnerable, and honest.\\" Track listingPersonnel Adapted from liner notes. ;Alcest * Neige ‚Äì vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion, glockenspiel * Winterhalter ‚Äì drums, percussion ;Additional musicians *amiina ‚Äì strings *Hildur √Års√¶lsd√≥ttir ‚Äì violin *Neil Halstead ‚Äì vocals *Billie Lindahl ‚Äì choir, vocals *Edda R√∫n √ìlafsd√≥ttir ‚Äì viola *Maria Huld Markan Sigf√∫sd√≥ttir ‚Äì violin *S√≥lr√∫n Sumarli√∞ad√≥ttir ‚Äì cello ;Other personnel *Birgir J√≥n Birgisson ‚Äì arrangement, engineering, mixing, production *Elisabeth Carlsson ‚Äì assistant *Andy Julia ‚Äì picture *William Lacalmontie ‚Äì band photo *Joe LaPorta ‚Äì mastering *Metastazis ‚Äì layout *MK ‚Äì production *Antoine Nouel ‚Äì assistant *Valnoir ‚Äì layout ReferencesExternal links * Category:2014 albums Category:Alcest albums Category:Dream pop albums by French artists Category:Post-rock albums by French artists ","title":"Shelter (Alcest album)"},{"id":"41623798","title":"Jean-Pierre Kutwa"},{"id":"41623799","title":"Chibly Langlois"},{"id":"41623821","text":"The Indian Signing System or Indian Sign System (ISS) is a convention for manually coded language used in India.

Many of the buildings he designed are listed on the heritage registers in Australia. Early life Andrea Stombuco travelled widely and was involved in various business enterprises, including stone quarrying at Cape Town in South Africa. Career=Victoria= Andrea Stombuco emigrated to Victoria in 1851. After trying his luck on the goldfields, he established himself in Victoria as a sculptor, monumental mason, builder and architect, and found a patron in the Roman Catholic Church. He was the contractor for a number of Catholic churches in Victoria and for most of the stonework of Ballarat Cathedral. =Career in New South Wales= In 1869 Stambuco was appointed Architect for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Goulburn in New South Wales. In 1874, the foundation stone of St Matthais' Anglican Church, Currawang, was laid by The Venerable Archdeacon Puddicombe of Goulburn. The design was by Stambuco. Stambuco at the time conducted a practice in Verner Street of that city. =Queensland= Stombuco moved to Queensland in 1875 on the advice of Rev. Patrick Dunne of Goulburn, and may have been appointed Catholic Diocesan Architect, receiving a number of important architectural commissions from the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James O'Quinn. These included St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace at Brisbane (1875‚Äì76), St Mary's Presbytery at Ipswich (1876), St Francis Xavier Church at Goodna (1880‚Äì81), part of All Hallows at Petrie Bight (1880‚Äì82) and St Patrick's Church at Fortitude Valley (1880‚Äì82). With his eldest son, Giovanni Stombuco, whom he took into partnership in 1886, he also designed St Joseph's Christian Brother's College at Nudgee, erected 1889-90. Among his more prominent non- Catholic works were St Andrew's Anglican Church at South Brisbane (1878‚Äì83) and Her Majesty's Opera House in Queen Street (1885‚Äì88). Stombuco designed a number of large houses in Brisbane, including Friedenthal (1886‚Äì87) at Eagle Farm for WH Heckelman; and Rhyndarra (1889) at Yeronga for W Williams. He also designed several speculative ventures for himself, including Bertholme at New Farm (now the Moreton Club). San Souci  Sans Souci (meaning 'without care', now known as Palma Rosa) is a three-level sandstone house built in 1886-87, possibly as a speculative venture for, and to the design of Andrea Stombuco. It is one of Stombuco's most flamboyant residential designs, erected at the pinnacle of his success in Queensland. Ironically, construction of the building may also have been a strong contributory cause to his near insolvency in the late 1880s/early 1890s. Stombuco had obtained title to the Sans Souci site in 1886. At that time it comprised 3 roods 19.2 perches, and was part of the Toorak Estate subdivision. The house was designed in 1886, the year Giovanni Stombuco entered into partnership with his father, but it is not known to what extent he contributed to the design. The house was constructed in 1886-87 by Brisbane contractors JAM O'Keeffe (who possibly had the overall supervision), A Petrie (who supplied the stone) and J Watson (presumably of the plumbing firm Watson Brothers), and builders Bell & McLaughlan. On completion in late 1887, Sans Souci was described in the local press as undoubtedly one of the finest residences in or about Brisbane. The building was of three storeys, and constructed of stone from Petrie's Quarry (probably the nearby Petrie's Quarry, on the northern side of Crosby Road). The rooms were all generously proportioned, with elaborate French-polished joinery and highly decorative cornices and ceiling roses in the principal rooms. The main hallway was decorated with an arch supported by fluted columns with corinthian capitals, and had tessellated Minton tiles on the floor. Sicilian marble was used for the steps at the front door and at the porch entrance, and for most of the mantelpieces, which also had Minton tiles in the hearths. Whether San Souci was built as a speculative venture, or whether it was intended as the Stombuco family home, is not clear. If the Stombucos occupied the house, it was very briefly. The house was completed by mid-December 1887, when Stombuco hosted an entertainment at Sans Souci to mark the completion of the building, but from 1888 to 1891, the Queensland Post Office Directories list Stombuco's private residence as Lechmere Street, New Farm. In September 1888, Stombuco took out a mortgage of ¬£4,500 on Sans Souci from the Queensland Investment and Land Mortgage Company Ltd, of which Sir Arthur Hunter Palmer, Premier of Queensland from May 1870 to January 1874, was a director and principal shareholder. When Queensland's boom economy crashed in 1890, Stombuco was forced to auction his then residence, Briar House - a more modest residence in Lechmere Street, New Farm, which he had erected in 1888. Some time before 1891, it appears that the mortgage company controlled San Souci, although Stombuco technically retained title until 1913. Later life Following his financial collapse, Andrea Stombuco left Queensland for Perth, Western Australia in 1891. His wife and son remained in Queensland, but Stombuco never returned, and died in Perth in 1907. Giovanni Stombuco retired from architecture when his father left Queensland in 1891, moving with his mother to Spring Vale Farm at Kuraby.

These German immigrants came the same route as the earlier migration from Bremen, Germany, to New Orleans and then on to Perry County, Missouri. However, they did not arrive with the earlier migration in April, 1839. They left in September, 1839 and arrived in Perry County on December 12, 1839. Since many of the German settlers came from Pastor Gruber's congregation in Paitzdorf, Germany, the fifteen people who organized the church on February 2, 1840, decided to name the church \\"The Old Lutheran Church of Paitzdorf, Perry County, state of Missouri.\\" The term \\"Old Lutheran\\" refers to the German usage \\"Alt-Lutheraner\\" and describes those Lutherans who remained independent and did not join with the state churches that combined both Lutheran and Reformed churches in one single organization. Worship and education were carried out in the homes of families until the first log school was built in 1856. The congregation joined the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod in 1852, and became a charter congregation of the Western District of that synod. In 1874 plans were made to construct a new church at an estimated cost of $5,000. However, costs would exceed the initial $5,000 by another $1,000. The plans called for a building long, wide, and tall with a tower and steeple of . Clay for the bricks was dug and fired nearby. The Young Men's Club contributed to the purchase of the bell. The church was dedicated on January 9, 1876. In 1880 a new brick parsonage was built and served the congregation until 1951 when a new parsonage was constructed. Changes were made to the church in the late 1800s. In 1897 the church steeple from the roof up was covered with corrugated metal sheeting. The following year the ceiling was treated to a tin covering. A new school was built in 1906 and served that purpose until a new school was built in 1954. An addition to the rear of the church was constructed in 1913 to serve as both a vestry and room for confirmation instruction. In 1921, a teacherage was purchased and used until the construction of a new teacherage in 1946. From the beginning services were conducted in German. In 1927, English services were conducted once a month. Sunday Christian instruction (Christenlehre) continued to be conducted in German until at least 1943. In 1929, the congregation adopted the name \\"Grace Evengelical Lutheran Church\\" as its official name, with the term \\"Evangelical\\" deriving from German and meaning \\"Protestant.\\" In 1938, a new third cemetery was laid out and the church‚Äôs pipe organ was purchased. In the 1940s events in Europe and World War II brought a growing desire to hold more English services than German. On August 11, 1963, Grace formed a dual parish with Zion Lutheran Church in Longtown due to a shortage of pastors. A tornado struck the church on December 15, 1971, toppling the tower and steeple onto the roof after first removing most of the roof. The interior suffered minor water damage. On May 21, 1972, a new fiberglass steeple was constructed on top of the bell tower, and the tower and steeple were raised to above the roof top. The repairs amounted to almost $10,000. The school closed in 1985, with students attending other Lutheran schools in the area. The teacherage was sold in 1986. In 2008, a new narthex and porch were added to the front of the church.UNIONTOWN - A SHORT HISTORY AND SOME STATISTICS OF GRACE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CONGREGATION AT UNIONTOWN, PERRY CO., MO. http://www.lutheransonline.com/servlet/lo_ProcServ/dbpage=page&GID;=20073437268641384901111555&PG;=20083394741486876101111555 School Grace Lutheran Church operated a parochial elementary school between 1856 and 1985.

Early life  Tracz was born in 1940 in Poland. He studied Mathematics in Warsaw and Jerusalem, before studying cinema at the Slade School of Fine Art. He collaborated with Israeli writer Hanoch Levin on the 1978 feature film Fantasia Al Noseh Romanti.  Business career  In academic publishing, Tracz is known as the founder of the Current Opinion journals (which, along with the research journal Current Biology and the early scientific community websites BioMedNet and Chemweb, were acquired by Elsevier in 1997), and open access publisher BioMed Central (acquired by Springer Science+Business Media in 2008). In 2004, Tracz was invited to give oral evidence to the House of Commons Science & Technology Committee as part of its inquiry into scientific publishing and open access. Tracz's Science Navigation Group (SNG) previously published The Scientist (a popular science magazine with all print and web content freely available online), and currently publishes Faculty of 1000 (a subscription-only current awareness service highlighting recent biological and medical research), Global DataPoint, Telmap and People's Archive. Other companies that have been part of SNG in the past include Current Medicine Group, which publish medical books, journals, websites and the Images.MD medical image database (both acquired by Springer in 2005), Current Drugs (acquired by Thomson Reuters), and Current Biology and the Current Opinion journals (acquired by Elsevier). Other businesses founded by Tracz include Current Drugs (acquired by Thomson Corporation in 2002), and Telmap, a mobile phone navigation company (acquired by Intel in 2012). Tracz remains chairman of Science Navigation Group, which acts as an incubator for his new businesses. Tracz's businesses have been largely self-funded, without external investment. Tracz's current business is now focused on activities under the Faculty of 1000/F1000 brand. Faculty of 1000 began as a literature evaluation service, but more recently has allowed the publication of original scientific posters (F1000 Posters) and research articles (F1000 Research). F1000 has generated some controversy with its use of an innovative and rapid form of peer review. Web of Stories consists of a collection of multi-hour video interviews with leading scientists and other major cultural figures, looking back at their career and work. Each video is divided into short segments which are connected together to create a \\"web of stories\\", showing differing perspectives on major themes such as the Manhattan Project.

It is also variously known as the Hawaiian common gallinule, Hawaiian moorhen, Hawaiian common moorhen, mudhen, or \`alae \`ula (‚Äúburnt forehead‚Äù - for its prominent red frontal shield) in Hawaiian, and sometimes misleadingly as the Hawaiian red coot. It is a subspecies of the common gallinule that is endemic to the tropical Hawaiian Islands of the north-central Pacific Ocean. It is dependent on freshwater wetland habitats with dense emergent vegetation for nesting. Once found on most of the main islands of the Hawaiian archipelago, it has undergone a major population and range decline and is now a resident breeder only on Kaua'i and O'ahu. Causes of the decline were mainly loss of habitat, hunting and predation by introduced animals, with numbers subsequently stabilised at a low level through legal protection and conservation management. Despite being hunted for food, it was mythologised as the keeper of fire in Hawaiian religion. Taxonomy It is likely that the Hawaiian gallinule is descended from stray migrant common gallinules from North America. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the common moorhen, and subsequently as a subspecies of the common gallinule when that species was split from the common moorhen in 2011. It is distinguished from other subspecies by a larger frontal shield and a red blush on the front and sides of the tibiotarsus. Description The Hawaiian gallinule has dark grey-brown upperparts, black head and neck, dark slate-blue underparts, with mostly white undertail coverts and white flank stripes. It has a large red frontal shield over a red, yellow- tipped, bill. The long, sturdy legs and long-toed feet are mainly yellowish- green. Sexes are similar. The body length of the gallinule is about 33 cm. The average body mass of adult birds is 350 g. Immature birds are olive- to greyish-brown, with duller pale yellow to brown bills. =Identification= The gallinule is easily distinguished from the only similar bird in its range, the Hawaiian coot, by the latter's white frontal shield. Its vocalisations have been described as ‚Äúchicken-like cackling calls and croaks which are louder and higher pitched than the coot‚Äôs‚Äù. Behaviour The gallinules are secretive birds, spending much time in dense wetland vegetation. While feeding in the open they will quickly seek cover when disturbed. At some locations, however, individuals are quite tame and will even approach humans. Despite the lack of webbing or lobes on their toes, the birds are good swimmers. They moult over a period of about 25 days each year, normally between June and September, when they are unable to fly and so more vulnerable to predation. =Breeding= Breeding may occur throughout the year, peaking from March to August; it is affected by water levels and vegetation growth. Nesting pairs are territorial, with territory size measured at 850‚Äì2400 m2. Nests are generally sited inconspicuously within dense vegetation above shallow, standing, fresh water not more than 60 cm deep. The nests are constructed on platforms of flattened or folded vegetation close to the water surface, with flooding being a major cause of nesting failure. Nests are about 26 cm across, with an inside diameter of 16 cm and a depth of 5 cm. Average egg size is 44.1 mm x 31.5 mm. Clutch size is usually five or six, with an incubation period of 19‚Äì22 days. When the chicks hatch, the adults eat or remove the eggshells from the vicinity of the nest site. The chicks are precocial, and are able to walk and swim soon after hatching, but depend on their parents for protection and feeding for some 21‚Äì25 days, after which they begin to feed independently. =Feeding= The birds forage in and near dense wetland vegetation. They are opportunistic feeders, consuming a variety of plant material (such as algae, grass and seeds) and invertebrates (including molluscs and aquatic insects). Distribution and habitat The gallinule used to occur on all the main Hawaiian Islands except Lanai and Kahoolawe, though it is now resident only on Kaua\`i and O\`ahu, with each island holding roughly half of the remaining population. The population on Kaua‚Äòi (which has been mongoose-free) occurs in lowland wetlands and valleys, especially the Hanalei and Wailua River valleys, and in irrigation channels on the MƒÅnƒÅ Plains in the south-west of the island. A stronghold is the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge. The O‚Äòahu population is widespread on the island but is mostly found on the northern and eastern coasts between Waimanalo and Haleiwa. Smaller numbers occur at Pearl Harbor and the Lualualei Valley. The gallinule inhabits mainly freshwater lowland wetlands, usually below 125 m elevation, such as streams, springs or seeps, natural ponds, marshes, wet meadows, lotus and taro fields, reservoirs, sediment basins, sewage ponds, and drainage ditches. It prefers dense emergent vegetation near open water, often with floating mats of vegetation, with water depths of less than a metre. To a lesser extent it will visit brackish or marine wetlands such as lagoons and shrimp aquaculture ponds. Although the birds are non-migratory, banding studies show that some dispersal occurs in spring between wetlands (and possibly between islands), in response to changes in water levels. Status and conservation Population numbers and range of the Hawaiian gallinule declined during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. By the late 1940s the conservation status of the subspecies was considered ‚Äúprecarious‚Äô‚Äô. On Hawai\`i Island gallinules were last reported in 1887; subsequent attempts to reintroduce them in the late 1920s, and again in the 1950s, failed. They disappeared from Moloka\`i sometime after the 1940s; a 1983 reintroduction was also unsuccessful, with five of the six reintroduced birds being shot for food. In 1967 the gallinule was listed as endangered under the US Federal Endangered Species Act. It is also classified as endangered by the State of Hawai'i. Surveys in the 1950s and 1960s estimated that there were no more than 57 individual birds, though numbers have increased since then. Annual counts of gallinules indicate that recent population numbers are low but relatively stable. Counting such cryptic birds is not easy; over the decade from 1998 to 2007 the average total recorded in the biannual count program was 287 birds (with numbers fluctuating between about 100 and 450), while assessments during the 1970s ‚Äì 2000s have estimated the total population at 750 birds. Causes of the decline include agricultural, residential and recreational development leading to the loss, fragmentation and modification of wetlands. Introduced animals such as bullfrogs, rats, cats, dogs and mongooses prey on the gallinules, especially at their nests. Hunting was also a major factor, at least until it was banned in 1939. Ongoing threats include illegal hunting and the destruction of nests by vandals. As well as occasional attempts to reintroduce gallinules to islands within their former range from which they have been extirpated, conservation efforts focus on the protection and management of wetlands, predator control, the enforcement of strict hunting laws, public education, and working with private organisations and landowners. Mythology and cultural use According to Hawaiian historian David Malo the gallinule was regarded as a deity and was worshipped. One version of a legend is that the bird was the keeper of fire for the gods, until the culture hero Maui extracted the secret of firemaking from it; an alternate version is that the bird, taking pity on humanity, stole fire from the gods so that people could keep warm and cook their food. Both versions attribute the red frontal shield of the bird to scorching by fire. Hawaiians also believed that hearing the cry of the bird at night was an unlucky omen, foretelling death. The gallinules were eaten, captured by being run down or by stone-throwing; the flesh is supposedly tasty, though gamey and tough.

She and her sister ship Aconcagua ran between Valpara√≠so and New York via the Panama Canal until 1932, when CSAV was hit by the Great Depression and surrendered the two ships to the Scottish shipbuilder Lithgows to clear a debt. In 1935 the Egyptian company KML bought and renamed both ships and put them on routes across the Mediterranean. Teno was renamed Mohamed Ali El-Kebir after a former Egyptian monarch. In 1940 the British Government requisitioned both liners and had them converted into troop ships. Within months of being converted, Mohamed Ali El-Kebir was sunk in the Western Approaches by a German submarine with the loss of 96 people. However, her escort drove away the submarine and rescued 766 survivors. Teno In April 1920 the Chilean Compa√±√≠a Sud Americana de Vapores (CSAV) ordered a pair of passenger and cargo liners for service between Valpara√≠so and New York via the Panama Canal. Construction was delayed, the ships were not completed until the latter part of 1922, and CSAV lost money as a result. The first ship, Aconcagua, was launched on 11 February 1922 and completed in August. Her sister ship was launched on 5 September 1922, completed in December and reached Chile in January 1923. She was to be named after the Chilean city of Boroa, but she was launched as Teno after the Chilean city of that name about south of Valpara√≠so. The two ships were built by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock on the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. Each had 18 corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of that heated six single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of . These fed steam at 215 lbf/in2 to four steam turbines that drove twin propeller shafts by single-reduction gearing. The turbines had a combined rating of 1,469 NHP and gave the ship a speed of . By the time Aconcagua and Teno entered service they faced strong competition from Grace Line, and CSAV reported losses in 1922 and 1923. However, from 1922 the Chilean government introduced protection measures for Chilean companies operating shipping services along the country's -long coast, and in 1923 global shipping rates stabilised. The Wall Street Crash of October 1929 started the Great Depression, which sharply reduced the export market for Chilean mining products and hence the country's ability to buy goods from overseas. CSAV lost trade, and especially on its Valpara√≠so ‚Äì New York route, so in June 1931 the company suspended the service. It sold Aconcagua and Teno to Lithgows of Port Glasgow, and in August 1932 both ships returned to Scotland. Aconcagua was sold to William Hamilton and Company, run by Lord Ernest Hamilton, but Teno was laid up at the Kyles of Bute, first at Kames, Argyll and then off Tighnabruaich. Lowden Conner and Company of Liverpool were appointed to manage both ships. Mohamed Ali El-Kebir In 1935 the Khedivial Mail Steamship and Graving Dock Company of Alexandria, Egypt bought both Aconcagua and Teno. The company, which traded as the Khedivial Mail Line (KML), renamed each ship after a former Khedive of Egypt. Teno became Mohamed Ali El-Kebir, after Muhammad Ali Pasha who reigned 1805‚Äì48.

King Farouk and Queen Farida at their wedding in 1938, before their honeymoon aboard Mohamed Ali El-Kebir In 1938 King Farouk of Egypt married his first wife, Queen Farida. They took part of their honeymoon aboard Mohamed Ali El-Kebir. After the Second World War broke out in 1939, Mohamed Ali El-Kebir sailed to Britain. En route she called at Gibraltar where she joined Convoy HG 4, which left on 22 October and reached Liverpool on the 29th. She then returned to the Mediterranean and ran a regular service between Alexandria and Marseille until March 1940. Although Egypt was supposedly independent, in practice the British Empire controlled the country. In 1940 the UK Ministry of War Transport requisitioned seven KML ships and placed two of them, and Mohamed Ali El-Kebir, under the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Company. Initially the Admiralty used Mohamed Ali El-Kebir as a Royal Navy stores ship, but then she was converted into a troop ship, which increased her gross register tonnage and net register tonnage by more than 200 tons. Loss In 1940 Mohamed Ali El-Kebir again left the Mediterranean for Britain. En route she joined Convoy HG 36 at Gibraltar, which left on 28 June and reached Liverpool on 8 July. At the beginning of August 1940 she was in Avonmouth, where she loaded mail and government stores and embarked 697 troops bound for the Mediterranean. There were six officers and 243 men of the 706th Construction Company, Royal Engineers, six officers and 289 men of the 15th Company, Royal Pioneer Corps, two officers and 44 ratings of the Royal Navy, 20 Royal Marines, and 97 officers and men of the Royal Artillery and the Intelligence Corps. As Mohamed Ali El-Kebir sank, defended her from further attack and rescued 766 survivors. The ship left Avonmouth on 5 August, escorted by the G-class destroyer . At 2140 hrs on 7 August the convoy was in the Western Approaches about west of Bloody Foreland in Ireland, making a zigzag course at when fired two stern- launched torpedoes at her. One hit Mohamed Ali El-Kebirs starboard quarter, and she started to settle by the stern. Griffin attacked and chased away the submarine and then went to rescue survivors. Mohamed Ali El-Kebir had launched 11 lifeboats and more than 20 liferafts, and Griffin then launched her two whalers. The sea was rough, some of the lifeboats were swamped and some men were swept off the liferafts. Mohamed Ali El-Kebirs civilian ship's doctor, Stuart Liston, and a military medical officer remained aboard to treat many wounded men and prepare them for evacuation. Her Master, John Thompson, remained aboard until after the last lifeboat was launched. He was last seen in a liferaft but did not survive. Dr Liston did not survive either. Griffin continued to release depth charges to keep U-38 away. Mohamed Ali El-Kebir sank at 2340 hrs; two hours after she was hit. Griffin rescued 766 survivors, including 62 wounded. They were 549 troops, 154 Merchant Navy crew, 62 Royal Navy personnel and one DEMS gunner. Some men were in the water for up to seven hours before they were found, and a number died of hypothermia after being rescued. She continued to search the area for survivors until the next morning. She then took the survivors to Greenock, where she arrived on 9 August. 96 men were lost: 82 troops, four Royal Navy personnel, Captain Thompson and nine Merchant Navy crew.

National politics After the dissolution of the National Socialist Movement of Chile (MNSCH) in 1938, notable former members of MNSCH migrated into Partido Agrario Laborista (PAL), obtaining high charges. Not all former MNSCH members joined the PAL; some continued to form parties of the MNSCH line until 1952. A new old-school Nazi party was formed in 1964 by school teacher Franz Pfeiffer. Among the activities of this group were the organization of a Miss Nazi beauty contest and the formation of a Chilean branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The party disbanded in 1970. Pfeiffer attempted to restart it in 1983 in the wake of a wave of protest against the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Historically Nazism had also detractors in Chile. Example of this is the telegram sent by Salvador Allende and other members of the Congress of Chile to Adolf Hitler after the Kristallnacht (1938) in which they denounced the persecution of Jews. German Chilean community Even before the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933 there was a German Chilean youth organization with strong Nazi influence. Nazi Germany pursued a policy of Nazification of the German Chilean community. These communities and their organizations were considered a cornerstone to extend the Nazi ideology across the world by Nazi Germany. It is widely known that albeit there were discrepancies most German Chileans were passive supporters of Nazi Germany. Nazism was widespread among the German Lutheran Church hierarchy in Chile. A local chapter of the Nazi Party was started in Chile. While Nazi Germany did pursue a policy of nazification of overseas German communities the German community in Chile did not act as an extension of the German state to any significant degree. Racial ideologies Nicol√°s Palacios considered the \\"Chilean race\\" to be a mix of two bellicose master races: the Visigoths of Spain and the Mapuche (Araucanians) of Chile.Palacios 1918, p. 35-36 Palacios traces the origins of the Spanish component of the \\"Chilean race\\" to the coast of the Baltic Sea, specifically to G√∂taland in Sweden, one of the supposed homelands of the Goths. Palacios claimed that both the blonde-haired and the bronze-coloured Chilean Mestizo share a \\"moral physonomy\\" and a masculine psychology.Palacios 1918, p. 37 He opposed immigration from Southern Europe, and argued that Mestizos who are derived from south Europeans lack \\"cerebral control\\" and are a social load.Palacios 1918, p. 41  See also  * Colonia Dignidad * Antisemitism in Chile * German influence in Chile * Nazism in the United States and South America * Seguro Obrero massacre ReferencesBibliography * * Identidad, ideolog√≠a y pol√≠tica en el Movimiento Nacional Socialista de Chile, 1932-1938* * El nacionalismo chileno entre el fascismo y el autoritarismo conservador * Documentos sobre actividades nazi en Chile (1937 y 1944) Category:Far-right politics in Chile Category:German-Chilean culture Chile Chile ","title":"Nazism in Chile"},{"id":"41624486","text":"Jane Priestman OBE (born 7 April 1930) is a British designer who has performed a number of high-profile roles in design and architecture. She was appointed an OBE in 1991 for her work in design and an honorary doctorate from Sheffield Hallam University in 1998. Background She is the daughter of Reuben Stanley Herbert and Mary Elizabeth Ramplr. She married Arthur Martin Priestman in 1954. She was educated at Northwood College and Liverpool College of Art. At the Liverpool College of Art, Priestman was trained as a textile designer, as opposed to architecture. Her interest in architecture, led her to become even more interested in interior design. She relocated to Australia in 1951, with her loom by her side, in hopes of launching a career in the textile industry. Priestman quickly realized that the textile industry, for her, short lived. Before getting her career started, she balanced raising a family, and doing freelance work for clients. Career Priestman qualified as an interior designer. Priestman ran her own design practice in the mid 1950s and became extremely successful in that for about 20 years. She began this business shortly after graduating university. She subsequently became General Manager in Architecture and Design for the British Airport Authority from 1975 to 1986 and then Director of Architecture, Design and Environment for British Rail from 1986 to 1991. Her goal while doing so, was to expand upon what attitude the buildings portrayed when guests walked in. This is where her skills shined the most, because this led her to be one of the most reputable designers. Collaboration was the way Priestman taught other designers to work. Being a mentor to young designers, Jane Priestman was able to become an influential piece of the design world. She spent 18 years, until 2010, as chair of Open City (the organisation behind Open House). She also became an Enabler, in 2001, for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE). Priestman is credited for opening doors for women all over the UK, and potentially the world. Her accomplishments in design, and her authority that she was able to hold, gave women a higher standard than what they were perceived as during that time. This is extremely significant, because Priestman had no management training or experience in her field. She was able to successfully perform her duties with excellence, in the way any man could. Her portfolio consisted of over 2,800 stations that she completed during her entire career. She was shortlisted for the Jane Drew Prize in 1998, for inclusiveness in architecture.  Awards and Accomplishments  Jane Priestman, due to her successes with her career, has been recognized with many prestigious awards. In 1985, Priestman was officially recognized as an honorary member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). She was also awarded the Ada Louise Huxtable Prize award in 2015 for her accomplishments in design. She won this at age 85, because she had the vision that architecture could change lives. Priestman accomplished recognition and control and prestige in the design community, for women in specifics. Current and future generations are able to be seen differently due to the work that Jane Priestman has accomplished. References 7\\\\.

It was the first and only musical film produced by Gainsborough Studios. Commissioned by the British Ministry of Information, it was set at the beginning of the 20th century, and was about the composers of popular music hall songs fighting for a new copyright law that will protect them from having their songs stolen.Murphy p.202 Copyright scholar Adrian Johns has called the film \\"propaganda\\" and \\"a one-dimensional account of the piracy crisis [about sheet music in the early 20th century] from the publishers' perspective\\", but also highlighted its value as historical document, with large parts of the dialogue \\"closely culled from the actual raids, court cases, and arguments of 1900-1905.\\" Plot In 1900 Bob Fielding arrives in London from the north of England determined to make it as a song publisher. He visits a music hall where he hears Edie Story singing \\"Oh Mr Porter\\" by George Le Brunn. Songwriters Kahn and Kelly sell their latest song, \\"I'll Be Your Sweetheart\\" to Jim Knight, who also wants to be a publisher. Knight doesn't give them an advance so they sell it to Jim. This causes a rivalry between Bob and Jim, which is increased when both men fall in love with Edie. Bob leads a movement to smash the music pirates. He asks Edie to speak out against them but she refuses, reluctant to get involved with what she sees is a political issue. However when composer Le Brunn dies impoverished, Edie makes an on-stage appeal to her audience to fight piracy. Eventually the copyright bill is passed with the help of MP T.P. O'Connor. Bob leads a group of song writers to smash the printing presses of the pirates, resulting in a large brawl where Bob and his allies are victorious. Bob and Edie decide to get married.

The history of surveying in early America included the mapping of large, unknown territories and the layout of the District of Columbia. Several presidents were involved, including George Washington. The Founding Father as surveyor George Washington was not only a founding political father of the U.S., he was a founding surveyor of Virginia, as well. At the age of eleven, he inherited Ferry Farm. When George reached school age, instead of a career in the Royal Navy, George went to school to study surveying and geometry. His first surveying tools were from his own storehouse on Ferry Farm.Frontiers: George Washington, surveyor and mapmaker At the age of 17, under the tutelage of Joshua Fry, he surveyed the northern neck of Virginia and became the county surveyor for Culpeper County, Virginia. By the time of the French and Indian War, he had laid out most of northern Virginia, and this knowledge would contribute to his success during the war. From 1747 to 1799, he surveyed 200 tracts of land, and due to his also being a land speculator, he amassed of land. During the Revolutionary War, he appointed the first geographer of the Continental Army, Robert Erskine. Surveying the District of Columbia Surveying was not only for the wealthy plantation owners, but the entire new nation needed to be surveyed, and resurveyed. Most of all, the proposed new capital city, bearing Washington‚Äôs name, needed to be surveyed. A two-man team would survey what became the District of Columbia in 1791. The first was Benjamin Banneker, a free ex-slave, who learned to read, write, and do math from his grandmother. Banneker would go on to be a leading astronomer, mathematician, clock maker, and most of all, a surveyor. The second man was Andrew Ellicott. He would go on to do several prominent surveys of the area and assist Lewis and Clark in planning their expedition. The training of a naturalist Statue of Jefferson surveying a site for the University of Virginia Prior to independence, Peter Jefferson, along with his son Thomas Jefferson, were land surveyors for the crown. At this time, surveyors used a system known as the metes and bounds system, which used \\"monuments\\"; identifiable objects such as rocks, trees etc., as property markers. The surveyor would measure from monument to monument. The major problem with this system was the fact that these monuments were not necessarily permanent. As a result, Thomas Jefferson was involved in the creation the Public Land Survey System. A comparison of county boundaries in the various states graphically displays the difference between the systems, as counties in the Eastern states are irregularly shaped whereas counties in the Midwest tend to be square or rectangular. Needing money to pay the debts for the Revolutionary War, Jefferson began selling land in the Northwest Territory in plots of for $2.50 an acre. Soon after, he sold the land in plots of for $1.25 an acre. The NW Territory was surveyed using the Rectangular System. This system used a central point determined by a Principal North-South Meridian Line and an East- West Base line. Jefferson convinced Congress to accept the land deal with Napoleon. As a result of the Louisiana Purchase and Jefferson‚Äôs love for nature, Jefferson organized the Lewis and Clark expedition. Andrew Ellicott taught Lewis and Clark how to use a sextant to map their position. Lewis and Clark would leave from Wood River, Illinois and document the wilderness all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Lincoln: politics and surveying Abraham Lincoln came to New Salem in 1831, and shortly after in 1832, he lost in his bid to become a state representative. The Sangamon County Surveyor, John Calhoun, then offered Lincoln a job as Deputy Surveyor due to the high volume of resurveying. As Deputy Surveyor, Lincoln surveyed five towns, four roads, and thirty properties. The first was the plat for Huron, a proposed town North of Springfield that never came to be. The proposal was that county would build a canal to straighten the Sangamon River, but the canal was never built. The last town Lincoln laid out was New Boston, a town at the confluence of the Iowa River and the Mississippi River. Instead of payment for his work, Lincoln had his surveying equipment repossessed and sold. Unknown to Lincoln, Jimmy Short, a friend, bought all of his equipment, his horse, and his saddlebags. Short returned Lincoln‚Äôs surveying equipment and later, as president, Lincoln returned the favor by making Short the Indian Agent of the Round Lake Indian Reservation.

GJ 526 is smaller than the Sun, with 28% of the mass and 58.2% of the radius. It shines with just 1.1% of the luminosity of the Sun, with its stellar atmosphere radiating at an effective temperature of 3,474 K. GJ 526 has been examined for an excess of radiation in the infrared. The presence of an infrared excess can be taken as an indication of a debris disk orbiting the star. However, no such excess was discovered around GJ 526.

It constitutes a town and locality within the Redland City. The south/east side of Lamb Island sits within the Protection and Conservation park zone which is home to protected species of marine life including dugong, dolphins and leatherback turtles. In the , Lamb Island had a population of 432 people.  History  Lamb Island has a rich history of food production dating back to the early 1900s. The island consisted of numerous small farms which supplied produce to the mainland Brisbane market. Due to the unique micro climate created by the islands geographic location, its extremely fertile volcanic soil and the pure sand aquifers that run beneath it, the farmers were able to supply superior produce to the mainland market earlier than their mainland competitors. There were several boats (including the well known historic vessels \\"Roo\\" and \\"Amazon\\") which travelled from the upper reaches of the Brisbane river out to the island to transport the produce. The Roo would also transport supplies from Brisbane for the island's residents and weekend trippers who would visit the island. One of the well known attractions was Peggy Saunders' garden parties. Peggy Saunders was the wife of one of the original farmers and was well known for her beautiful garden which was located on the Western waterfront of the island. In the late 1970s Lamb Island, like much of South East Queensland, was developed into small residential allotments. The majority of the original farm land was subdivided with only a handful of small farming lots remaining. The island has remained largely undeveloped with the majority of the small residential lots being left as vacant land. Residential development has been limited largely due to transport costs of materials for building. The small lot sub division is, to some degree, being undone, as a result of the Redland City Council's 2020 initiative to promote land buy buy back by residents who own neighboring lots to those held by the Council. Additionally, due to the low price of land preceding 2020, it was not uncommon for resident land owners to buy multiple adjoining lots to increase lot sizes. In recent years, with the popularity and resurgence of organic food, the island is gaining a reputation for its unique micro climate and organically grown produce. In addition to commercial organic growing ventures on the island, there are a number of small community garden groups engaged in organic food and ornamental plant production together with a local artisan industry with an emphasis on Permaculture values. The Island has a very active incorporated residents' association (LIRA - Lamb Island Resident's Association) which is regularly engaged in community improvement projects which have included native tree planting, heritage site restoration/maintenance and general facility upgrades. Heritage listings Lamb Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Lavender Street: Dam and melaleuca forest * 109-123 Lucas Drive: Lamb Island Pioneer Hall * Road Reserve at end of Lucas Drive: Jetty Shed which has been restored by the local island community group and was used for loading local produce onto the merchant boats * At the end of Lucas Drive: Thomas Lucas‚Äô Grave * :Tina Avenue: Mango trees which were planted over 100 years ago by the acclimatisation society * Home located on Tina Avenue which was one of the original farm houses, then served as the local post office and telephone exchange  Demographics  In the , Lamb Island recorded a population of 427 people, 50.4% female and 49.6% male. The median age of the Lamb Island population was 51 years, 14 years above the national median of 37. 69.4% of people living in Lamb Island were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 6.8%, New Zealand 6.5%, Philippines 2.3%, Netherlands 1.6%, Germany 1.2%. 90.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 2.8% Tagalog, 0.9% German, 0.9% French, 0.9% Samoan, 0.9% Spanish. In the , Lamb Island recorded a population of 432 people, 49% female and 51% male. The median age of the Lamb Island population was 59 years. The number of private dwellings on the island was 330.  Transportation  Transportation to Lamb Island is by high speed passenger ferry and vehicular barge service. The high speed passenger ferries run approximately every half hour from approximately 4 am ‚Äì midnight, 7 days per week (subject to changing timetables) and numerous residents commute daily to the mainland. The transport terminal is located on the Southern end of Lucas Drive which is the central main road. The high speed passenger ferry takes approximately 15 minutes from the mainland. The vehicular barge transports all motor vehicles and is capable of transporting large semi trailers. The barge takes approximately 45 minutes from the mainland. The cost of travel on the high speed ferry between the other Southern Moreton Bay Islands is free of charge. The high speed ferry service utilizes the Queensland Government's Translink go card system. In late 2019 a private locally operated mini bus service was introduced to the island to provide transport to and from the island's ferry terminal. Also in late 2019 trials of Australia's first driverless bus were conducted on the smaller neighboring Karragarra Island with a view to introducing the service to the islands' communities.  Services  *Electricity - mainland power supply *Water - mainland water supply *Sewer - all recent and new builds must comply with advanced secondary water treatment standards *Internet/Telephone - reliable broadband internet is available and in early 2020 NBN became available. *Groceries - The island has its own small convenience store open 7 days per week and in addition, Woolworths provides an online home delivery weekly grocery service equivalent to that of the mainland. *Alcohol - a bottle shop is located at the Lamb Island Recreation Club *Entertainment - the Lamb Island Recreation Club incorporates a casual club style dining venue and hosts regular performing artists including musicians and comedians *Sport - a public tennis/basketball court is located next to Pioneer Hall and the Recreation Club Residents also have access to an online car share service located on the mainland. Share cars are available at the mainland ferry terminal, using a mobile phone app.  Arts & Culture  Lamb Island was the title and subject of a 2010 short film by film maker Tim Marshall. Peter Ludlow's book entitled \\"Moreton Bay People\\" features historical figures and features of Lamb Island. The island forms part of the Redland City Council's heritage trail which identifies significant local heritage sites. Numerous art installations are located around the island including artist Antone Bruinsma's \\"Island Girl\\" which is located close to the ferry terminal. The \\"Girt by Sea\\" visual arts competition is held annually with a prize pool of approximately $90,000. The competition is supported by the Redland City Council which has acquired several of the entries in the Girt by Sea competition and located them on Lamb Island.

Taxonomy The description of Solatisonax cabrali by Ten√≥rio and colleagues, in 2011, was initially based on four young and eroded juvenile shells. The subsequent discovery of two well-preserved empty shells from southeastern Brazil (a juvenile and an adult specimen) brought new information on the species' distribution, ontogeny and morphology, which culminated in a redescription by Cavallari and colleagues in 2013. A few mix-ups involving type specimen figuration and measurements in the original description were also stressed and rectified in the redescription. S. cabrali was named after Brazilian government employee Enilson Cabral, an analyst of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) responsible for collecting the materials used in Ten√≥rio's study. Description Solatisonax cabrali has a small, relatively thick-walled shell, with a maximum known diameter of and up to 5 whorls. The outer surface of the shell is almost thoroughly ornamented by spiral and axial nodose cords and threads. Its outline changes along the ontogeny, from disk-shaped during the earliest stages of development to depressed cone-shaped in adult specimens. Similarly, the shell's basal region is more inflated than the upper side in younger specimens, but in adult individuals this relationship is inversed. The dome- shaped, inflated protoconch is considered small for an architectonicid as defined by Bieler (1993), ranging from to at 1.5 whorl. It has a glossy surface and a strong terminal varix marking the protoconch-teleoconch transition. Shell color is variable from pale beige to white, with scattered beige spots. Since no living specimens of S. cabrali were collected to date, the operculum, as well as any details of the animal's soft parts are yet to be described. Ecology ;Distribution and habitat Solatisonax cabrali is known only from Brazilian waters, ranging from Pernambuco and Alagoas to Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo states. It can be found at depths of 230‚Äì720 m, usually on sandy and muddy bottoms. The species' range was greatly expanded in the redescription, and includes petroleum extraction sites such as the Campos Basin.

Lhasa became the capital of Tibet in the beginning of this period, with all temporal power being conferred to the 5th Dalai Lama by G√ºshi Khan in Shigatse. After the expulsion of the Dzungars, Tibet was under administrative rule of the Qing dynasty between 1720 and 1912, but the Ganden Phodrang government lasted until the 1950s, when Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China. Kashag became the governing council of the Ganden Phodrang regime during the early Qing rule. Name \\"Ganden Phodrang\\" was named after the residential quarters of the holder of the Dalai Lama lineage in the Drepung Monastery since the 2nd Dalai Lama. When the 5th Dalai Lama came to power and the expansion of the Potala Palace began, the Dalai Lama moved away from the actual quarters Ganden Phodrang and stayed at the Potala in the winter and Norbulingka in the summer. According to some, the Ganden Phodrang is represented by the Central Tibetan Administration or Dalai Lama's government- in-exile in Dharamshala, India after 1959. However, this is \\"Ganden Phodrang\\" in a different sense, the personal service or labrang of the Dalai Lama. History The Potala Palace in Lhasa =Background= Altan Khan of the T√ºmed Mongols chose the Gelug order of Tibetan Buddhism as his Buddhist faith. In 1577 he invited the leader of this order, Sonam Gyatso, to come to Mongolia and teach his people. He designated Sonam Gyatso as \\"Dalai\\" (a translation into Mongolian of the name Gyatso, meaning \\"ocean\\"). As a result, Sonam Gyatso became known as the Dalai Lama. Since this title was also posthumously given to Gendun Drup and Gendun Gyatso, who were considered Sonam Gyatso's previous incarnations, Sonam Gyatso was recognized as being already the 3rd Dalai Lama. =Early era= The 5th Dalai Lama (r. 1642‚Äì1682) is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were successful in part because of aid from G√ºshi Khan, the Oirat leader who established the Khoshut Khanate. With G√ºshi Khan as a completely uninvolved patron, who had conferred supreme authority on the Dalai Lama for the whole of Tibet at a ceremony at Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. All power and authority lay in the hands of the Dalai Lama right up to his death and G√ºshi Khan did not interfere in the administration nor tried to control its policies. The core leadership of this government is also referred to as the \\"Ganden Phodrang\\" or \\"Ganden Podrang\\", derived from the name of the estate of the Dalai Lamas at Drepung Monastery. The 5th Dalai Lama initiated the construction of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, and moved the centre of government there from Drepung. It remained the chief residence of the Dalai Lama until the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. From 1679 to 1684, the Ganden Phodrang fought in the Tibet‚ÄìLadakh‚ÄìMughal War against the Namgyal dynasty of neighboring Ladakh, with the 5th Dalai Lama overruling the advice of his Prime Minister. The 5th Dalai Lama died in 1682 and the subsequent Prime Minister, Desi Sangye Gyatso, agreed on the 1684 Treaty of Tingmosgang with the King Delek Namgyal of Ladakh to end the war. The original text of the Treaty of Tingmosgang no longer survives, but its contents are summarized in the Ladakh Chronicles. =Qing protectorate= In 1717, the last khan of the Khoshut Khanate, Lha-bzang Khan, was killed by the Mongol Dzungar Khanate forces invading Lhasa. The Dzungar forces were in turn expelled by the expedition forces of the Qing dynasty from Tibet in 1720, thus beginning the period of Qing rule of Tibet. The Kashag, the governing council of Tibet also lasted in Lhasa until the 1950s, was created in 1721 and set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty in 1751. In that year the Tibetan government was reorganized after the riots in Lhasa of the previous year. The first Europeans to arrive in Tibet were the Portuguese missionaries Ant√≥nio de Andrade and Manuel Marques in 1624. They were welcomed by the King and Queen of Guge, and were allowed to build a church and to introduce the Christian faith. The king of Guge eagerly accepted Christianity as an offsetting religious influence to dilute the thriving Gelugpa and to counterbalance his potential rivals and consolidate his position. All missionaries were expelled in 1745. Stein 1972, pg. 83 =Post-Qing era= After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, which ended Qing rule over Tibet, the 13th Dalai Lama declared himself ruler of an independent Tibet. It was considered by the Republic of China as a part of the new republic, which gave Tibet the status of an \\"Area\\". This would last until the 1950s, when Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China. The Kashag state structure remained in place for a few years but was formally dissolved in 1959 after the 1959 Tibetan uprising. The Tibet Autonomous Region was established by China in 1965 out of a part of the Tibetan ethno-cultural area. The Central Tibetan Administration was established by the 14th Dalai Lama and based in McLeod Ganj India since 1959.

Each axis has 20 positions representing the 20 amino acids. There are 400 possible 2 amino acid proteins (dipeptide) which can be arranged in a 2D grid. the 8000 tripeptides can be arranged in a 3D cube. Most proteins are longer than 100 amino acids and so occupy large, multidimensional spaces containing an astronomical number protein sequences. How directed evolution climbs fitness landscapes. Performing multiple rounds of directed evolution is useful not only because a new library of mutants is created in each round, but also because each new library uses better mutants as templates than the previous. The experiment is analogous to climbing a hill on a 'fitness landscape,' where elevation represents the desired property. The goal is to reach the summit, which represents the best achievable mutant. Each round of selection samples mutants on all sides of the starting template (1) and selects the mutant with the highest elevation, thereby climbing the hill. This is repeated until a local summit is reached (2). In evolutionary biology, sequence space is a way of representing all possible sequences (for a protein, gene or genome). The sequence space has one dimension per amino acid or nucleotide in the sequence leading to highly dimensional spaces. Most sequences in sequence space have no function, leaving relatively small regions that are populated by naturally occurring genes. Each protein sequence is adjacent to all other sequences that can be reached through a single mutation. It has been estimated that the whole functional protein sequence space has been explored by life on the Earth.http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/25/953 Evolution can be visualised as the process of sampling nearby sequences in sequence space and moving to any with improved fitness over the current one. Representation A sequence space is usually laid out as a grid. For protein sequence spaces, each residue in the protein is represented by a dimension with 20 possible positions along that axis corresponding to the possible amino acids. Hence there are 400 possible dipeptides arranged in a 20x20 space but that expands to 10130 for even a small protein of 100 amino acids arranges in a space with 100 dimensions. Although such overwhelming multidimensionality cannot be visualised or represented diagrammatically, it provides a useful abstract model to think about the range of proteins and evolution from one sequence to another. These highly multidimensional spaces can be compressed to 2 or 3 dimensions using principal component analysis. A fitness landscape is simply a sequence space with an extra vertical axis of fitness added for each sequence. Functional sequences in sequence space Despite the diversity of protein superfamilies, sequence space is extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Most random protein sequences have no fold or function. Enzyme superfamilies, therefore, exist as tiny clusters of active proteins in a vast empty space of non-functional sequence. The density of functional proteins in sequence space, and the proximity of different functions to one another is a key determinant in understanding evolvability. The degree of interpenetration of two neutral networks of different activities in sequence space will determine how easy it is to evolve from one activity to another. The more overlap between different activities in sequence space, the more cryptic variation for promiscuous activity will be. Protein sequence space has been compared to the Library of Babel, a theoretical library containing all possible books that are 410 pages long. In the Library of Babel, finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order. The same would be true of protein sequences if it were not for natural selection, which has selected out only protein sequences that make sense. Additionally, each protein sequences is surrounded by a set of neighbours (point mutants) that are likely have at least some function. On the other hand, the effective \\"alphabet\\" of the sequence space may in fact be quite small, reducing the useful number of amino acids from 20 to a much lower number. For example, in an extremely simplified view, all amino acids can be sorted into two classes (hydrophobic/polar) by hydrophobicity and still allow many common structures to show up. Early life on Earth may have only four or five types of amino acids to work with, and researches have shown that functional proteins can be created from wild-type ones by a similar alphabet- reduction process. Reduced alphabets are also useful in bioinformatics, as they provide an easy way of analyzing protein similarity. Exploration through directed evolution and rational design DNA libraries generated by random mutagenesis sample sequence space. The amino acid substituted into a given position is shown. Each dot or set of connected dots is one member of the library. Error-prone PCR randomly mutates some residues to other amino acids. Alanine scanning replaces each reside of the protein with alanine, one- by-one. Site saturation substitutes each of the 20 possible amino acids (or some subset of them) at a single position, one-by-one. A major focus in the field of protein engineering is on creating DNA libraries that sample regions of sequence space, often with the goal of finding mutants of proteins with enhanced functions compared to the wild type. These libraries are created either by using a wild type sequence as a template and applying one or more mutagenesis techniques to make different variants of it, or by creating proteins from scratch using artificial gene synthesis. These libraries are then screened or selected, and ones with improved phenotypes are used for the next round of mutagenesis.

It was designed by Andrea Stombuco and built from 1878 to 1932. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Andrew's Anglican Church at South Brisbane was constructed in several stages: 1878-1883, 1887, and 1931-1932, as funds became progressively available. The first Anglican church in South Brisbane, St Thomas', had been built on the corner of Grey and Melbourne Streets. The construction of St Andrew's reflected the growing population of the area and the general move of residential and public buildings up the hill away from the flood-prone area of first settlement. Flamboyant Italian architect Andrea Stombuco was commissioned to design St Andrew's, which was to be a substantial structure in stone. Stombuco, who had designed a number of ecclesiastical buildings for the Catholic Church, including St Joseph's Christian Brothers' College on Gregory Terrace (1875-1876), Rathbawn (a house built for Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James Quinn) at Nudgee (1875-1878) and St Mary's Roman Catholic Presbytery in Ipswich (1875), envisaged a grand structure for St Andrew's, with a prominent tower and spire. The foundation stone for St Andrew's was laid on Saturday 30 November 1878 by Queensland Governor Arthur Kennedy. Work commenced in 1878, but was abandoned when the walls had reached a height of only . Stombuco's design had proved beyond the financial means of the parish, and work did not resume until 1882. The chancel, transepts and first bay of the nave were completed in the following year by the builder James O'Keeffe. The church was officially opened and dedicated on Wednesday 6 June 1883 by Bishop Matthew Hale assisted by Archdeacon Benjamin Glennie with over 500 people present. An 1887 extension was designed by architect Hezekiah Watson King Martin, who had recently arrived in Brisbane from London, and was an active member of the St Andrew's congregation. In 1887, architect John H. Buckeridge designed the rectory for St Andrew‚Äôs Church and also extensions to it in 1892. The rectory was later relocated to 112 Airlie Road, Pullenvale and is used as a private home. The parish hall was built in 1909 to a design by architect William Alfred Caldwell. Stombuco's original design included a tower and spire, which were never built The continued growth in the congregation led to the completion of the nave in 1931-1932, under the supervision of architect Lange Leopold Powell. The tower and spire of Stombuco's design were never completed.  Description  St Andrews is a large Gothic-style church, cruciform in shape and made of Brisbane tuff. In addition to the nave and transepts there is a portico at the front and a chancel at the western end. Both of these wings have a lower roof line than the nave. A small vestry is located to the north of the chancel and the half-built tower is to the south. There is a substantial subfloor beneath the church. The steeply pitched gable roof is of slate. A notable feature of the building is the large stained glass windows, especially those located at the end of the chancel, portico and transepts. The timber hall consists of a core surrounded by enclosed verandah wings. The core has a steeply pitched gable roof in corrugated iron and fine timber ceiling supported by timber trusses.  Heritage listing  St Andrews Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Andrew's Anglican Church is significant historically in demonstrating the expansion of the Anglican Church in Queensland, and the evolution of South Brisbane as a rival to North Brisbane in terms of commerce, municipal development and population increase, in the second half of the 19th century. The construction of St Andrew's illustrates the move away from the river flats after the 1860s flood, and the growing popularity among the middle-class of the higher ridges in South Brisbane and Highgate Hill. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is important as a rare example of a substantial, stone gothic-style church in Brisbane, with particularly fine stained glass windows, and is a well-known South Brisbane landmark which has contributed to the Brisbane townscape for over a century.

It is endemic in western North American stands of Douglas fir, but was first discovered in Douglas fir trees planted Switzerland. When trees in America were checked, it was found that the fungus was common but apparently caused no disease. However, in the 1980s and 90s the disease became noticeable and problematic. Abstract The classification of Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii within the Venturiaceae has been questioned, with molecular studies placing it in the Mycosphaerellaceae (Capnodiales), close to species of Mycosphaerella and Rasutoria, such as Rasutoria pseudotsugae and Rasutoria tsugae. The fungus infects trees in the spring, and continues to develop over the following winter. The fungus causes yellowing (chlorosis) of the needles, with eventual necrosis and premature needle-drop. In some heavily diseased stands of trees, the only needles remaining are those of the current year, in which the disease has not yet had time to fully develop. The overall result for the infected tree is reduced growth. The fungus is temperature dependent within the Douglas fir range, with the highest level of infection in the warmest part of the range.

On 10 May 1852 he was promoted to brigadier general. He was given command of the 3rd infantry brigade at the Helfaut camp near Saint-Omer. He married Mary Festugi√®re of Bordeaux in 1853, with whom he had three children. At the start of the Crimean War he led the 1st Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division. He distinguished himself in the Battle of the Chernaya and the Battle of Malakoff. He was promoted to major general, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division of General Pierre Bosquet's 2nd Corps. On return to France, Espinasse became inspector general of infantry in 1857. The emperor appointed him Minister of the Interior and Public Security after the assassination attempt by Felice Orsini on 14 January 1858. He held this position from 7 February to 14 June 1858, when he was appointed senator. Espinasse joined the army of Italy on 2 April 1859 as commander of the 2nd Division of the 2nd Corps of General MacMahon's army. Espinasse was killed in the village of Magenta, Lombardy on 4 June 1859, during the Battle of Magenta.

It was designed by George Henry Male Addison and built from 1888 to 1889 by Thomas Pearson & Sons. It was originally known as Albert Street Methodist Church and Central Methodist Mission. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The first Methodist church in Brisbane, a modest brick chapel, was constructed in 1849 on the corner of Albert Street and Burnett Lane. It was replaced in 1856 by a larger building. By the early 1880s the congregation had grown substantially and in 1884 purchased a site on the corner of Albert and Ann Streets. A competition was held for the design of a new church which was won by G H M Addison. The church was built for a cost of by contractor Thomas Pearson & Sons. Other tradespeople included Petrie & Son (joinery), and Exton and Gough (stained glass windows). In keeping with the importance placed on music in Methodism, a large pipe organ was installed. It was built by George Benson of Manchester for a cost of . Five foundation stones were laid by prominent congregation members on 18 August 1888 and the church was officially opened on 8 November 1889. In the 1920s a marble honour board was erected in the front entrance vestibule commemorating the members of the congregation who served in World War I. Additional stained glass windows were installed as memorials in 1944 and 1947. Restoration work was undertaken in 1974-75 and involved the replacement of the slate roof. Further repair work on the building has been undertaken over the years. In 1907 the church became known as the Central Methodist Mission in recognition of its wider responsibilities as the main Methodist church in the city. The congregation has been involved in a variety of welfare activities and has developed an extensive network of accommodation and other services for aged people. The church served as the symbolic centre of Methodism in Queensland. The Annual Conference was opened each year in the church and significant occasions for Methodists were celebrated there. With the formation of the Uniting Church in 1977, the church was renamed Albert Street Uniting Church.  Description  thumb View from Ann Street, 2013 Albert Street Uniting Church is built of red brick with trimmings in white Oamaru limestone, now painted, and has a slate roof. It is an example of a Victorian Gothic Revival church with its cruciform plan shape, steeply pitched roof forms, the imposing spire beside the entry, and the heavy buttressing of the facades. The entry to the church is from an open porch with three Gothic arches at the end of the nave. Similar arcades exist down the sides of the church. A single large Gothic opening with fine tracery is located above the entry porch. To the right of the entry is a tower rising to the octagonal spire which has tall dormers on four of its faces and four pinnacles at the corners of its base. The top of the spire has a wrought iron finial. The roof on the nave also has small dormer ventilators. A side entry is to the right of the base of the tower and has a broad Gothic arch with a steeply pitched parapet topped by a Christian cross. The end of each transept has a rose window in the gable end above a pair of Gothic arched windows that in turn are above groups of smaller openings. Internally, the nave floor slopes down towards the pulpit and the walls are rendered, with a timber boarded dado. The galleries contain tiered seating and are supported on cast iron columns with ornate capitals. The main ceiling and gallery soffits are diagonally boarded and finely carved timberwork is incorporated into the gallery railings, roof structure and furnishings. The focus of the interior is the pulpit and organ. The pulpit is raised several metres above the floor, and reflects the importance in the Methodist tradition that was given to preaching. Above and behind the pulpit is a large decoratively painted pipe organ which reflects the value placed by Methodists on music and singing.

His father undertook missionary work in West Africa but it damaged his health and he died in 1863 and Addison was raised by his maternal grandfather, Henry Male in Somerset. His sister, Emily Jane Addison (1855‚Äì?) worked as a governess to the family of Alexander McArthur in Brixton and, in 1834 married their son John Percival McArthur (1858‚Äì1901). He was articled to architect Edmund Isles Hubbard at Rotherham and studied at the Royal Academy in London. Addison immigrated to South Australia to work on a number of large government projects. After that, he moved to Melbourne and worked for the firm Terry and Oakden, later forming the firm Oakden, Addison and Kemp. There he was one of the founders of the Melbourne Art Society along with John Mather, Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin and other well-known artists. In 1884 he married Emily Alice Maude with whom he had four children: *Lily Isabel Maude Addison (1885‚Äì1968) *Edward James Addison (1887‚Äì1956) *George Frederick Addison (1889‚Äì1985) *Edith May Addison (1892‚Äì?)

Each node represents a gene sequence and each line represents the mutation connecting two sequences. Neutral networks can be thought of as high, flat plateaus in a fitness landscape. During neutral evolution, genes can randomly move through neutral networks and traverse regions of sequence space which may have consequences for robustness and evolvability. Genetic and molecular causes Neutral networks exist in fitness landscapes since proteins are robust to mutations. This leads to extended networks of genes of equivalent function, linked by neutral mutations. Proteins are resistant to mutations because many sequences can fold into highly similar structural folds. A protein adopts a limited ensemble of native conformations because those conformers have lower energy than unfolded and mis-folded states (ŒîŒîG of folding). This is achieved by a distributed, internal network of cooperative interactions (hydrophobic, polar and covalent). Protein structural robustness results from few single mutations being sufficiently disruptive to compromise function. Proteins have also evolved to avoid aggregation as partially folded proteins can combine to form large, repeating, insoluble protein fibrils and masses. There is evidence that proteins show negative design features to reduce the exposure of aggregation- prone beta-sheet motifs in their structures. Additionally, there is some evidence that the genetic code itself may be optimised such that most point mutations lead to similar amino acids (conservative). Together these factors create a distribution of fitness effects of mutations that contains a high proportion of neutral and nearly-neutral mutations. Evolution Neutral networks are a subset of the sequences in sequence space that have equivalent function, and so form a wide, flat plateau in a fitness landscape. Neutral evolution can therefore be visualised as a population diffusing from one set of sequence nodes, through the neutral network, to another cluster of sequence nodes. Since the majority of evolution is thought to be neutral,Kimura, Motoo. (1983). The neutral theory of molecular evolution. Cambridge a large proportion of gene change is the movement though expansive neutral networks. =Robustness= Each circle represents a functional gene variant and lines represents point mutations between them. Light grid-regions have low fitness, dark regions have high fitness. (a) White circles have few neutral neighbours, black circles have many. Light grid-regions contain no circles because those sequences have low fitness. (b) Within a neutral network, the population is predicted to evolve towards the centre and away from ‚Äòfitness cliffs‚Äô (dark arrows). The more neutral neighbours a sequence has, the more robust to mutations it is since mutations are more likely to simply neutrally convert it into an equally functional sequence. Indeed, if there are large differences between the number of neutral neighbours of different sequences within a neutral network, the population is predicted to evolve towards these robust sequences. This is sometimes called circum-neutrality and represents the movement of populations away from cliffs in the fitness landscape. In addition to in silico models, these processes are beginning to be confirmed by experimental evolution of cytochrome P450s and B-lactamase. =Evolvability= Interest in the interplay between genetic drift and selection has been around since the 1930s when the shifting-balance theory proposed that in some situations, genetic drift could facilitate later adaptive evolution. Although the specifics of the theory were largely discredited, it drew attention to the possibility that drift could generate cryptic variation that, though neutral to current function, may affect selection for new functions (evolvability). By definition, all genes in a neutral network have equivalent function, however some may exhibit promiscuous activities which could serve as starting points for adaptive evolution towards new functions. In terms of sequence space, current theories predict that if the neutral networks for two different activities overlap, a neutrally evolving population may diffuse to regions of the neutral network of the first activity that allow it to access the second. This would only be the case when the distance between activities is smaller than the distance that a neutrally evolving population can cover. The degree of interpenetration of the two networks will determine how common cryptic variation for the promiscuous activity is in sequence space.  Mathematical Framework  The fact that neutral mutations were probably widespread was proposed by Freese and Yoshida in 1965.Freese, E. and Yoshida, A. (1965). The role of mutations in evolution. In V Bryson, and H J Vogel, eds. Evolving Genes and Proteins, pp. 341-55. Academic, New York. Motoo Kimura later crystallized a theory of neutral evolution in 1968 with King and Jukes independently proposing a similar theory (1969). Kimura computed the rate of nucleotide substitutions in a population (i.e. the average time for one base pair replacement to occur within a genome) and found it to be ~1.8 years. Such a high rate would not be tolerated by any mammalian population according to Haldane's formula. He thus concluded that, in mammals, neutral (or nearly neutral) nucleotide substitution mutations of DNA must dominate. He computed that such mutations were occurring at the rate of roughly 0-5 per year per gamete. A simple genotype-phenotype map. In later years, a new paradigm emerged, that placed RNA as a precursor molecule to DNA. A primordial molecule principle was put forth as early as 1968 by Crick, and lead to what is now known as The RNA World Hypothesis. DNA is found, predominantly, as fully base paired double helices, while biological RNA is single stranded and often exhibits complex base-pairing interactions. These are due to its increased ability to form hydrogen bonds, a fact which stems from the existence of the extra hydroxyl group in the ribose sugar. In the 1970s, Stein and M. Waterman laid the groundwork for the combinatorics of RNA secondary structures. Waterman gave the first graph theoretic description of RNA secondary structures and their associated properties, and used them to produce an efficient minimum free energy (MFE) folding algorithm.M.S. Waterman. Secondary structure of single - stranded nucleic acids. Adv. Math. I (suppl.), 1:167‚Äì212, 1978. An RNA secondary structure can be viewed as a diagram over N labeled vertices with its Watson-Crick base pairs represented as non-crossing arcs in the upper half plane. Therefore, a secondary structure is a scaffold having many sequences compatible with its implied base pairing constraints. Later, Smith and Waterman developed an algorithm that performed local sequence alignment. Another prediction algorithm for RNA secondary structure was given by Nussinov Nussinov's algorithm described the folding problem over a two letter alphabet as a planar graph optimization problem, where the quantity to be maximized is the number of matchings in the sequence string. Come the year 1980, Howell et al. computed a generating function of all foldings of a sequence while D. Sankoff (1985) described algorithms for alignment of finite sequences, the prediction of RNA secondary structures (folding), and the reconstruction of proto-sequences on a phylo-genetic tree.David Sankoff Simultaneous solution of the RNA folding, alignment and protosequence problems. 1985/10 SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics Volume 45 Issue 5 Pages 810-825 Later, Waterman and Temple (1986) produced a polynomial time dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for predicting general RNA secondary structure. while in the year 1990, John McCaskill presented a polynomial time DP algorithm for computing the full equilibrium partition function of an RNA secondary structure. M. Zuker, implemented algorithms for computation of MFE RNA secondary structures based on the work of Nussinov et al., Smith and Waterman and Studnicka, et al. Later L. Hofacker (et al., 1994), presented The Vienna RNA package, a software package that integrated MFE folding and the computation of the partition function as well as base pairing probabilities. Peter Schuster and W. Fontana (1994) shifted the focus towards sequence to structure maps (genotype-phenotype) . They used an inverse folding algorithm, to produce computational evidence that RNA sequences sharing the same structure are distributed randomly in sequence space. They observed that common structures can be reached from a random sequence by just a few mutations. These two facts lead them to conclude that the sequence space seemed to be percolated by neutral networks of nearest neighbor mutants that fold to the same structure. In 1997, C. Reidys Stadler and Schuster laid the mathematical foundations for the study and modelling of neutral networks of RNA secondary structures. Using a random graph model they proved the existence of a threshold value for connectivity of random sub-graphs in a configuration space, parametrized by Œª, the fraction of neutral neighbors. They showed that the networks are connected and percolate sequence space if the fraction of neutral nearest neighbors exceeds Œª*, a threshold value. Below this threshold the networks are partitioned into a largest giant component and several smaller ones. Key results of this analysis where concerned with threshold functions for density and connectivity for neutral networks as well as Schuster's shape space conjecture.

Relations between France and Japan prior to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 had been chilly. France was a member of the Triple Intervention, which Japan had felt humiliatingly limited her gains in the First Sino-Japanese War. France was also a vocal supporter of Russia in the recent conflict, although had been constrained by the Entente cordiale with the United Kingdom and the foreign policies of Th√©ophile Delcass√© from taking an open role. However, with Japan emerging as victor in the Russo-Japanese War and with France increasingly becoming estranged from an increasingly belligerent Germany, French foreign policy shifted.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 124. In the Franco- Japanese Treaty of 1907, both parties stated their commitment to the territorial integrity of China, as well as their support of the Open Door Policy, but also stated that both parties had a ‚Äúspecial interest‚Äù in maintaining peace and order in areas of China adjacent to territories where both parties had rights of sovereignty, protection or occupation. The non- public supplement of the agreement defined these areas as Manchuria, Mongolia and the province of Fukien for Japan, and the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong for France. The treaty implicitly recognized France‚Äôs position in French Indochina and one of the results of the treaty was a crackdown on the activities of Indochinese independence supporters and Vietnamese exiles in Japan by the Japanese police. However, the wording of the supplemental portions of the treaty were leaked to the French press, causing concern in the United States and in China regarding French and Japanese territorial ambitions in China, and the future of the Open Door Policy. Further negations between in Japan and the United States to clarify their respective positions contributed to the Root‚ÄìTakahira Agreement of 1908. The treaty was part of building a coalition as France took the lead in creating alliances with Japan, Russia and (informally) with Britain. Japan wanted to raise a loan in Paris, so France made the loan contingent on a Russo-Japanese agreement and a Japanese guaranty for France's strategically vulnerable possessions in Indochina. Britain encouraged the Russo-Japanese rapprochement. Thus was built the Triple Entente coalition that fought World War I.Ewen W.

It was designed by Lange Leopold Powell of Atkinson, Powell and Conrad and was built from 1928 to 1930 by George Alexander Stronach & Son. It is also known as the Masonic Memorial Temple. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Masonic Temple was constructed between 1928 and 1930. In April 1921 the United Grand Lodge of Queensland was formed by the union of the 281 Freemasons' lodges in Queensland. To commemorate the union the Grand Lodge agreed to construct a centrally located temple. In December 1921 land in Ann Street, with a frontage and depth of , was purchased. In December 1922 an additional was acquired to make the site symmetrical. The total cost of the land was ¬£6 874. In June 1923 a competition was held to produce a design for the temple. On 8 December 1924 the plans of Lange Powell (a freemason) of Atkinson, Powell and Conrad, were chosen from the 16 entries submitted. Tenders were called on 12 March 1928 but the plans were drastically modified. The tender of ¬£101,171 from Messrs George Alexander Stronach and Son, builders, was accepted. On Anzac Day (25 April) 1928 the Most Worshipful Brother Justice Charles Stumm laid the foundation stone. A time capsule was placed beneath the stone which contained copies of the 4 metropolitan newspapers of 24 April 1928, duplicate cheques contributed by Lodges and Brethren, a copy of the Grand Master's speech and coins. The construction of the Masonic Temple commenced in May 1928. The temple was completed in 1930 at a cost of ¬£103 000, plus ¬£10 000 for furniture. Freemasons throughout Queensland contributed towards the expense. The design provided a four storey building, with a basement for the caretaker and storerooms. The ground floor held the executive offices of the Grand Lodges of Queensland, a library and a museum. In the centre of the large circular vestibule was the Urn of Remembrance to Brethren who died in the First World War. The first floor comprised supper rooms and the second held the lodge rooms. The Grand Lodge room, approximately , on the top floor, seated 1100 people, and was described in the Architecture and Building Journal in February 1928 as the \\"largest and finest of its kind in Australia\\". The total cost of the project summed up to which included for the land and for furniture. Although the cost of the project was considered somewhat high, it was constructed to be able to take three more floors when this became necessary. On 9 December 1930 Sir John Goodwin, Governor of Queensland, unveiled and dedicated the memorial urn and on 10 December 1930 the Temple was opened by Most Worshipful Grand Master (Brother William Herbert Green) and dedicated as a memorial to fallen Brethren, a symbol of Masonic unity in Queensland and as a monument to Freemasonry in Queensland. Since 1930 the hall has been the centre of Masonic activity in Queensland.  Description  Foundation stone laid on Anzac Day, 25 April 1928 The Masonic Temple located in upper Ann Street is built in the Classical Revival style. It is rectangular in plan form with its short elevation facing Ann Street. The front facade features six fluted giant order Corinthian columns, each five feet in diameter at the base, supporting a rich entablature and pediment. Between the two central columns are leadlight steel framed windows and the main entry door at the base of the building. The sliding entry doors are bronze and heavily studded. In the bays between columns to either side of the entry are two bronze flagstaffs. The lower portion of the front is a grey granite base containing the foundation stone. The rest of the building has a concrete frame structure encased with both brick and sandstone. The front facade above the granite base is sandstone from Yangan. The initial structure was designed to allow for the possible addition of extra storeys at a future date. The position of the entrance door was described as \\"unfortunate\\" as it cuts into the columns rather than coming between them. Internally on the ground floor level directly behind the entrance is the Hall of Remembrance with its central Urn of Remembrance mounted on a black marble base surrounded by eight free-standing Tuscan columns arranged in a circle with a star-shaped pattern on the floor. The offices, library and museum open off the circular vestibule. Above the ground floor is the first floor with lodge rooms arranged around a central corridor, and on the second floor above there are supper rooms arranged in a similar fashion. Grand Hall, 2011 The third (top) floor mainly taken up by the Grand Hall, a large symmetrical open space with a vaulted coffered ceiling and stepped seating facing the centre. The interior walls have been rendered and given a sand float to give the appearance of sandstone and are surrounded by evenly spaced paired Corinthian pilasters. The organ chamber claims twenty eight feet of this floor space and the pipe organ was supplied by Messrs. B.B. Whitehouse and company. In front of the organ chamber is a gallery seating twenty-two choir members. The hall seats 1200 people.There is a beautifully curved vaulted coffered ceiling lightly decorated in blue and gold. The Grand Hall is used for many masonic ceremonies including Grand Installations and is reputed to be the finest of its kind in Australia. The floors are connected by a staircase consisting of varying coloured marble, white Carrara and black Buchan for the main stair with a green dado. A multi-coloured marble mosaic is a feature of the landing. The stair also features a wrought iron balustrade with polished timber handrail, and is top lit from above. The corridors have parquetry floors. The furniture throughout is silky oak, maple and cedar, all from Queensland, and particularly from Atherton. The symmetrical facade and overscale columns give the building great presence as part of the streetscape in this portion of Ann Street.  Heritage listing  Masonic Temple was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Masonic Temple was built as a monument to Freemasonry in Queensland and as a World War I memorial and is held in high esteem within the Masonic community.

The next year at the International Maritime Conference he accepted limits on the use of economic blockade, a considerable concession as Britain was at the time the world's greatest naval power. According to the naval historian Andrew Lambert: > He was a man of much charm and no little literary ability, a good linguist, > and a fluent, convincing, and persuasive speaker. Despite his many talents, > however, he was not a leader. He made the committee of imperial defence a > highly effective secretariat and co-ordinating body, but never achieved the > influence or eminence of his successor.
