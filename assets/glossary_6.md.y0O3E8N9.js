He was the son of Reformed Church pastor Conrad Steiner. The family is believed to have moved to the Thirteen Colonies from Switzerland, settling in Philadelphia. After completing an apprenticeship with the United Lutheran Ministry's printing operation, Steiner formed a partnership with Charles Cist, a Moravian American originally from St. Petersburg. For nearly two years Cist and Steiner published the Philadelphisches Staatsregister, which was very similar to other contemporary papers like Die Pennsylvanische Gazette published by John Dunlap, and Das Pennsylvanische Zeitungs-Blat, published while the British were still occupying Philadelphia during the first half of 1778. The first issue of Philadelphisches Staatsregister was published on July 21, 1779. By then, it may have been the only German language paper in America. Steiner and Cist dissolved their partnership in 1781. Steiner went on to publish Gemeinnützige Philadelphische Correspondenz. Melchior died in 1807.

A third suspect, Detective Voster Netshiongolo, involved in the shooting appeared before the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. Julies was shot meters away from his home in the Eldorado Park area of Johannesburg.  Incident  It was initially reported by Gauteng premier David Makhura that Julies was killed in crossfire between police and gang members. The Julies family have stated that he was at a local tuck shop buying biscuits when the shooting occurred. Officers allegedly involved in the shooting stated that Julies was shot after allegedly failing to respond to police questioning. Media reports stated that Julies died before reaching hospital. = Witness accounts = An unidentified family member told the media that after purchasing two packs of biscuits he joined other nearby children in front of the Hillbrow flats where the police first approached him. Julies father stated that Julies was approached by police officers who tried to question him. The officers were unable to understand Julies due to his down syndrome and so moved on to questioning another person nearby. After officers had finished questioning and searching the second person nearby officer Ndyalvane got out from a vehicle and shot Julies close range with a shotgun. The force of the shot propelled Julies' body under a truck. Shortly after the shooting police dragged his body out from under the truck and removed it from the scene. Eye witnesses stated that there was no gang presence in the area.  Aftermath  The shooting resulted in violent protest action in the Eldorado Park area with two SAPS officers and one Johannesburg Metro Police officer injured amidst threats by the community to burn down the local police station. A petition calling for the prosecution of those involved in the fatal shooting was signed by over 120,000 people. The incident highlighted long running community grievances with the way the local police station is run. Minister of Police Bheki Cele said that the actions of the officers implicated in Julies' death were \\"uncalled for\\". Eldorado Park community members criticised the EFF for trying to politicise the event and \\"disrespecting\\" the funeral procession. A tweet from American musician Solange Knowles increased awareness of the incident outside of South Africa. Mentioning Julies death along with the death of Oluwatoyin Salau and shooting by police of Breonna Taylor. At the time Julies was the second child to have been killed by police action in South Africa within the past month. The investigative journalism organisation, Viewfinder, found that 39 children died in police custody or due to police action between April 2012 and March 2018 and that very few officers where held accountable for the deaths.

Family  McPherson is the son of James Quar (1862–1932), who first gave himself the surname McPherson when he married in 1888. His family moved to Kilmarnock when he was still young, and he was a printer by profession. He is reported to have won about a hundred prizes in foot races over distances between 100 and 1,000 yards. From 1890 onwards, he was a part- time trainer at Kilmarnock F.C., which was accepted into the Scottish First Division in 1899 after participating in a Scottish Cup final (1897–98) and winning two second division championships in succession. The job, for which he was paid £25 a year, included taking care of the players' fitness twice a week and generally taking care of them. He had nothing to do with team line-ups or even tactics and had no specific expertise of football, which he only got to know as such in Kilmarnock. In 1903, McPherson Sr. became trainer at the English Football League first division club Newcastle United, where his Scottish compatriot Frank Watt was club secretary and thus generally speaking had the function of today's 'manager'. McPherson remained in the job until 1930, and Watt until his death in 1932. Their time at the club is described as Newcastle's \\"golden era\\": in this period the Magpies won four English First division titles and two FA Cups. McPherson Jr. had two brothers: John, who died at the age of 22, and Robert, known as \\"Mac\\" (1901–1969), who in the 1920s was manager of HBS-Craeyenhout in the Hague, Netherlands, leading them to the national championship in 1925. After a year or two in the Dutch East Indies, he became the last trainer of Ipswich Town before the club turned professional. McPherson Jr. also had two sisters, one of whom, Mary (1893–1973), married German international footballer Edwin Dutton who was with Newcastle shortly before the Great War. McPherson Jr. had several children. His eldest son, also named James Quar McPherson (following Scottish traditions), was on Newcastle United's playing staff without playing in a first-team match; he served in the Royal Air Force during World War II and was killed in an air crash at Pembrokeshire in Wales on a return flight from a mission in March 1942.  Career  = Beginnings = McPherson was not very prominent as footballer. Prior to World War I he played in the north east of England for North Shields Athletic and the Houghton Rovers in the North Eastern League. In 1911 he completed an unsuccessful trial with Newcastle United. He then worked for a while as his father's assistant at Newcastle United, which was the start of his coaching career. = 1919–1920: Start in the Netherlands - Olympics with Norway - Wales = McPherson took up his first position as chief coach in December 1919 at the Dutch club Vitesse in Arnhem, where the former player and president of FC Bayern Munich Willem Hesselink was then president. The club played in the eastern group of the first division. In March 1922, when relegation was avoided thanks to a 4–1 victory over PW from Enschede, a club named after the extraordinarily graceful Princess Wilhelmina, he was honored with a wreath. He then left the club. His successor was the former coach of Bayern, Charles Griffiths, under whom the club was relegated in 1922.Sport, Arnhemsche Courant, Arnhem, 1919-12-20, p. 2Oostelijke eerste klasse, Algemeen Handelsblad, Amsterdam, 1920-03-22 McPherson then led the Norwegian national team through the football tournament at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. At the tournament Norway defeated Great Britain in the first round 3–1, but lost 4–0 against Czechoslovakia in the subsequent quarter-finals. In the tournament for the silver and bronze medals, Norway lost 2–1 after extra time against Italy. Statistically, Norway finished the tournament fifth out of 15 participants. Between April 1922 and summer 1923 he was with Merthyr Town in Wales which played in the Football League Third Division South. The club finished eleventh in his first season (he took over towards its end) and 17th out of 22 clubs in the second. The following season he coached Workington in England's North Eastern League, which improved under his stewardship from seventh to fifth in the league. = 1924–1929: FC Bayern - VfB Leipzig and HRC in Holland = In 1924 McPherson became coach of the South Bavarian champions of 1923, FC Bayern Munich. When Bayern was only fourth in the district league, Bayern President Kurt Landauer wanted to replace him at the beginning of January 1925 with the Hungarian coach Imre Pozsonyi, who had become redundant at FC Barcelona in December, but Pozsonyi went for an offer from DFC Prague. In May 1925, on the occasion of its 25th anniversary, FC Bayern welcomed Boca Juniors from Buenos Aires and drew with them 1–1, the only one of seven matches played by the Argentines on their European tour in Germany which they did not win. For the 1925–26 season, FC Bayern established a very generous expenses scheme for the players, which was probably contrary to the statutes of German amateurism: when training twice a week, the players the players received 2.50 marks per day of practice; for every game in Munich the players received 10 marks, away it was 25 marks. With good players, that would have added up to 100 to 150 marks in good months, and at that time the average worker was receiving 200 marks per month for his labour. The team repaid the club by winning the Bavarian Championship ahead of the reigning German champions 1. FC Nürnberg (which was to win the national title again in 1927). After this, Bayern also won the Southern German championship for the first time, ahead of SpVgg Fürth. In May, Bayern was eliminated in the first round of the play-offs for the 1925–26 German championship with an unexpected 2–0 defeat at SV Fortuna Leipzig 02, a club little known in Munich. Bayern gave away two penalties before the Saxons scored their goals. Fortuna lost 6–2 in the next round, the quarter-finals against eventual winners Hamburger SV. The stars of Bayern of those years included the technically highly gifted centre-forward Josef Pöttinger and the winger Ludwig \\"Wiggerl\\" Hofmann. Both made their national team debuts in 1926. Defender Emil Kutterer also played for Germany in this period. From 1927 McPherson was replaced by the Hungarian Leó Weisz (who came from local rivals Wacker Munich) and also won the South German Championship with the club in 1928. From September 1927, McPherson was in Saxony with the reigning Central German champions VfB Leipzig, without winning any further titles during his time there. In April of 1928 he was again in the Netherlands, this time as the successor of the Englishman Herbert \\"John\\" Leavey as coach of second division Heldersche Racing Club, usually abbreviated to \\"HRC\\", in Den Helder. In the 1928–29 season he finished second behind AVV Zeeburgia. He was succeeded in 1929 by another former English professional James Moore, who opted to become a greengrocer after only one year.Duncan Holley, Gary Chalk: The Alphabet of the Saints. ACL & Polar Publishing. 1992, p. 246–247. = 1930–1938: Newcastle United = After this, McPherson returned to England where he became his father's successor as trainer of Newcastle United from 1930; a position he kept until his resignation in May 1938. Under the club's first manager Andy Cunningham, Newcastle won the 1932 FA Cup Final against Herbert Chapman's Arsenal, but that only partly masked the ongoing decline of the fortunes of the club which two years later was relegated for the first time. After World War II, McPherson made his living in Newcastle as a podiatrist and massage therapist.  References   Further reading  * Paul Joannou: Newcastle United: The Ultimate Who's Who 1881 - 2014.

The painting measures 25.2 x 20.9 inches (64 x 53 cm) and is part of the permanent collection of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. This painting is one of the last portraits by Ingres. There is a similar portrait housed at the Uffizi in Florence, realized some six years earlier than the Antwerp painting. Both paintings reportedly are based on a 1855 photo. The paintings are different in many respects, such as the objects depicted therein (hat, state decorations), the sitter's posture, and the lighting. The Antwerp version also differs from the apparently near- identical Fogg Painting (a self-portrait by Ingres realized in 1859, currently housed at the Fogg Art Museum) both in execution and structure; in the Antwerp version the lighting differs, and Ingres' hat produces no shadow. In the Antwerp painting, produced five or six years after the Fogg painting, Ingres made himself look younger. The 1864 Self-Portrait was realized for the Academy of Antwerp, upon Ingres' joining of the latter in old age. The portrait shows the painter’s self-regard. Ingres was 84 at the time, but painted a handsomer, younger and slimmer version of himself. The painting is the complacent confirmation of the status Ingres had achieved. Ingres signed the portrait emphatically: J. Ingres peint par lui, pour la Célèbre Academie d’Anvers. Context The French painter Ingres was a gifted painter, draftsman, etcher and violinist. This may be why art scholars have described his painting as having a musical character because of its melodic flowing lines and soft, harmonic coloration. Art scientists consider Ingres, after Jacques-Louis David , to be the head of the French Classicist school . Ingres mainly sketched genre scenes, mythological scenes and portraits.Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van België. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Moderne meesters, 1958, nr. 2. Before his effective entry into the Antwerp Academy in 1857, Ingres was an additional member of the academic corps. He could only officially join after the death of Paul Delaroche, and was asked to provide a work of art and a self-portrait. His artwork would hang in the Museum van de Akademiekers, which was founded by the Academy in 1852. The sick old artist found it difficult to comply. On July 3, 1865, he wrote a letter to the Academy to apologize: Je regrette d'avoir tant tardé à envoyer mon portrait à l'Académie d'Anvers, comme je l'avais promis. J'espère que l ' Académie et vous, Monsieur le Président, voudrez bien m'excuser en égard à mon âge et à l'irrégularité de ma santé, qui ne m'ont pas permis de remplir plus tôt cet engagement.Dorine Cardyn-Oomen, in Van Delacroix tot Courbet, 2004, p. 54-55; Peter De Laet, in Vouwblad Educatieve Dienst Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen.

The black cloth of the jacket contrasts with the silk collar, just as the hard nose of his fleshy face stands out against his fine, sleek hair. What is striking about the portrait is the self-satisfied, penetrating and slightly mocking look. The confrontation between the painter and the audience is very direct. The painter clearly shows his self-pride in this portrait. The portrait is a smug confirmation of Ingres' acquired status. Yet it is also an expression of his fear of death and decline. The portrait is Ingres' ultimate attempt to avert inevitable fate. He wrote: “I think a lot about my old age: it will take revenge on me”. Notes Sources * * Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van België.

The \\"Diurnall\\" of Thomas Rugge, which is preserved in the British Museum, corroborates Pepys in many ways. > MERCURIUS POLITICUS REDIVIVUS or, A Collection of the most materiall > occurrances and transactions in Public Affairs since Anno Dni, 1659, untill > 28 March 1672, serving as an annuall diurnall for future satisfaction and > information, BY THOMAS RUGGE. Est natura hominum novitatis avida.—Plinius. Thomas Rugge's Diurnall is preserved in the British Library, where it forms Add MSS 10116-10117. It belonged in 1693 to Thomas Grey, second earl of Stamford, and was purchased by the British Museum at Heber's sale in February 1836. It was published as The diurnal of Thomas Rugg, 1659-1661 by William Lewis Sachse ed. in 1961. Tea Urn The journal is important, early source for the drinking habits of the English of hot drinks, including a strange, new trend that would later have great cultural impact. English Tea Set 18th century. Tea service, tea spoons and sugar nippers, set out on a tripod table According to Thomas Rugge's Diurnall, in London 'Coffee, chocolate and a kind of drink called tee' were 'sold in almost every street in 1659'. > And theire ware also att this time a Turkish drink to bee sould, almost evry > street, called coffee, and another kind of drink called tee, and also a > drink called Chacolate, which was a very harty drink. Thomas Rugge paid hearth tax for nine hearths when he lived in Covent Garden, Middlesex in 1666. He lived in King Street 1651–c.1663. «Thomas Rugge was descended from an ancient Norfolk family, and two of his ancestors are described as Aldermen of Norwich. His death has been ascertained to have occurred about 1672; and in the Diary for the preceding year he complains that on account of his declining health, his entries will be but few. Nothing has been traced of his personal circumstances beyond the fact of his having lived for fourteen years in Covent Garden, then a fashionable locality.» This was the same ancient Norfolk family that William Rugge, Bishop of Norwich, belonged to. He may have been the Thomas Rugge of St. Paul, Covent Garden whose will was probated on 31 March 1670, though this seemingly predates the end of the journal entries. That would make him the Thomas Rugge who was buried on 16 March 1669/70 at St. Paul's, Covent Garden. At St. Paul's, Covent Garden, we find the following baptisms: * Elizabeth, baptised 26 October 1653, daughter to Thomas and Elizabeth Rugg, born on 26 October, the first entry of The registers of St. Paul's church, Convent garden, London * Ann, baptised 11 December 1654, daughter to Thomas and Elizabeth Rugg, born 11 December 1654, buried 9 May 1657 at St. Paul's, Covent Garden, Anna, daughter of Tho : Rugg * Mary, baptised on 27 June 1659, daughter to Thomas and Eliza : Rugg, born on 26 June 1659, buried 12 October 1659 at St. Paul's, Covent Garden, Mary, daughter of Tho : Rugg * John, baptised 16 April 1662, son of Thomas and Elizabeth Rugg, buried 17 October 1673 at St. Paul's, Covent Garden, John, son of Thomas Rugg At the time of the Commonwealth of England date of birth had to be registered in the parish registers. Half the entries in the journal, which spans more than a decade, are after the death of Mary in late 1659 and before the birth of John in early 1662. ODNB identifies the preceding marriage as that between Thomas Rugg and Elizabeth Cox at St. Clement Danes, in the City of Westminster, London, both of Covent Garden.1650: [...] July: Thomas Rugg & Elizabeth Cox both of Covent Garden Married – 4th The will of the widow of Thomas Rugge, Elizabeth Rugge née Cox (d.1695) of Saint Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, England, does not mention any children, but does mention her nephew, John Rugge of Bugden in the County of Huntingdon. This was the John Rugge (d.1720) of the Inner Temple, London and Stirtloe, Buckden, Huntingdonshire, gentleman, who married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir Robert Wright, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Their grandson was the Reverend William Rugge, Rector of Buckland (16 May 1740 – 2 November 1786). From his monument in Buckland Church, the coat of arms of the Reverend William Rugge, Rector of Buckland is described as: > Arms: Gules a chevron engrailed between three mullets pierced Argent. Of the arms of William Rugge, Bishop of Norwich, it is said: > William Rugge, Esq. of Felmingham, is said to have changed his arms, per > fess, sable and argent, and unicorn saliant, counterchanged, armed, mained > and unguled or, to that of gules, a chevron engrailed, between three mullets > pierced, argent; but Richard de Rugge, who lived in the 2d of Richard III. > and the Bishop of Norwich, bore, as it appears, this last coat. William Rugge, Rector of Buckland and William Rugge, Bishop of Norwich, were of the same family. So also were the Reverend's Rugge relations, amongst them his great-granduncle Thomas Rugge, the diarist.  The Coat of Arms  Chevron engrailed Arms: Gules a chevron engrailed between three mullets pierced Argent In heraldry: Gules is the tincture with the colour red Chevron engrailed Mullet pierced A star with straight-sided rays is usually called a mullet, and which may or may not be pierced Argent is the tincture of silver, and belongs to the class of light tinctures called \\"metals\\". It is very frequently depicted as white and usually considered interchangeable with it. In engravings and line drawings, regions to be tinctured argent are either left blank, or indicated with the abbreviation ar The Rugge coat of arms can be seen on the monument of Francis Rugge (1535–1607), Mayor of Norwich at St. Andrew's Church in Norwich, though the chevron does not appear to be engraileded. Francis Blomefield, Rector of Fersfield in Norfolk, writing some three hundred years prior to this, however, confirms this to be the coat of arms of Rugge in his An Essay Towards A Topographical History of the County of Norfolk: Volume 4, Containing the History of Norwich, Part II. The coat of arms of Rugge quarters, 1st, arg. a chevron ingrailed between six keys sab. 2d, arg. a chevron ingrailed sab. between three birds. 3d, Brome. There is a crescent for difference. The said quartered coats impale Aldrich, and there is a shield of Aldrich single. Of the other coats of arms the Rugge coat of arms is quartered with, Argent, a chevron, between three birds (martlets), sable, appears to be the coat of arms of Elizabeth Wood, Francis Rugge's mother. The Reverend Edmund Farrer in his The Church Heraldry of Norfolk : A Description of All Coats of Arms on Brasses, Monuments, Slabs, Hatchments, &c.;, Now to Be Found in the County writes that at Hoveton St. John can be found coloured shields on the screen, one of which is: > Gules, a chevron engrailed between three pierced mullets argent, Rugge The Rugge family owned property in Hoveton from at least 1533, when William Rugge, abbot of St. Bennet's, conveyed the manor of Greengate to Robert Rugge, his brother, alderman of Norwich. Robert still owned the manor of Greengate in 1558, with that of Spicer's, alias Berds, in Hoveton St. John, and St. Peter, Tunsted, Below, and Ashmanagh, the last sold to him also by the late abbot, his brother. The family held property there until at least 1618.

The riot came at a time of food shortages and rising prices in England. Violence broke out when local citizens intervened to prevent Lincolnshire merchants taking away Nottinghamshire cheeses they had bought at the fair. A warehouse, shops and a cargo boat were looted; and hundreds of cheese wheels were rolled through the streets. The army was deployed when the mayor was unable to restore control. One man was killed and others wounded as soldiers opened fire on the crowds. Order was eventually restored after some days of unrest.  Background  The Nottingham Goose Fair has its origins in the Feast of Matthew the Apostle, which was first celebrated in the city around 1,000 years ago. The feast became a livestock market where many geese were traded, and later became associated with the sale of horses, but by the 18th century it was most closely associated with foodstuffs including cheese, of which many tons were sold at the fair each year. The cheese manufactured in Nottingham at this time was sold in wheels and is believed to have been similar to Red Leicester. The poor harvest in 1766 led to fears of impending food shortages. That year's fair, beginning on 2 October, saw a larger than usual quantity of cheese for sale, but at inflated prices. There were recorded prices of 28 to 36 shillings (roughly £140–£180 in modern currency) per hundredweight (), around twice that recorded at Coventry market just a week earlier. As a result of the shortages, people across the country were anxious to keep foodstuffs in their local area; there were instances of merchants being overpowered and forced to sell their goods at pre-shortage rates.  Riot  An officer of the 15th Light Dragoons circa 1768 The riot broke out on 2 October 1766 after some Lincolnshire merchants purchased a large quantity of cheese with the intention of selling it in their county. They were then surrounded by a group of \\"rude lads\\" who demanded they not take away the cheese and instead share it out in Nottingham. Violence broke out and there was widespread looting of cheese; shop windows were broken and hundreds of cheese wheels were thrown and rolled down the streets including Wheeler Gate and Peck Lane. The mayor of Nottingham attempted to restore order but was knocked over by a rolling cheese. Some locals armed themselves and set up roadblocks on the city streets to prevent merchants from carrying away cheeses. A boat near Trent Bridge was seized and its cargo of cheese looted, despite its owner offering to pay the crowd or to sell his wares at a low cost. One warehouse was attacked and, though its defenders eventually drove the crowd off with firearms, some of the cheese was taken. The warehouse owner organised a mounted posse to track down the cheese, which had been taken to Castle Donington. The local magistrate refused to sign search warrants for houses in the village so the posse instead detained several citizens on suspicion of rioting and beat at the gates of the magistrates house, demanding justice. The posse was driven away by a mob of women and children throwing stones and withdrew, the cheese lost. In Nottingham the authorities called for military support to help restore peace. Nottingham at that time was a garrison town and the 15th Dragoons, together with militia infantry and cavalry, were deployed. Some shots were fired into the crowd causing injuries and the death of one man, William Eggleston of Car Colston who was standing near a pile of cheese. Eggleston was a farmer and it appears he was killed while protecting his own wares, having been mistaken for a looter. Several people were detained and brought before magistrates in a private residence, but were freed after the house was attacked by the mob, who smashed windows to gain access. The unrest continued overnight. Aftermath and legacy  Violence continued in Nottingham for several days until the military restored order. For a while, wagons carrying cheese were formed into convoys and provided with an armed escort. A local newspaper, the Leicester and Nottingham Journal, accused the rioters of having caused a cheese shortage in the city. There were other riots in England in late 1766 caused by food shortages and increasing food prices. The disorder was particularly severe in Devon and Cornwall but there were also serious outbreaks in Gloucester, Bristol, Derby, Birmingham, and Norwich; the South East was largely peaceful. The 250th anniversary of the riot was marked in 2016 by the Lord Mayor of Nottingham, Mohammed Saghir, in conjunction with a local cheese shop.

He was convicted of the killings and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is serving at the Polar Owl Colony. Early life Elistratov was born in Ulyanovsk in 1954, but moved to the Kazakh SSR at an early age. In 1990, he returned to Russia, settling in Moscow's Federal Avenue with his wife, who gave birth to two sons. The couple later divorced, with the woman claiming that Alexander never paid for anything, but they still decided to live together as a family. Elistratov was described very positively by his acquiantances, especially by his blind neighbor Alesya, who claimed that he would drive her for free around the city and even buy her family salmon, despite being a man of modest means. Unbeknownst to them, Alexander had four criminal convictions: two for illegal possession of weaponry, and one each for theft and robbery, but due to negligence of the authorities, he was presented as a first-time offender during his trials for the third and fourth convictions, for which he was given a 4-year suspended sentence in 2004. Crimes That same year, Elistratov bought a rusty, old VAZ-2101, whose previous owner had recently passed away, signing it in the dead man's name. He presented himself as a private taxi driver, despite the fact that his passport, which was issued in the former Soviet Union and was now invalid since the country had dissolved, was never reported to the authorities, and he was allowed to continue his illegal practice undetected. One day, while browsing through the Cherkizovsky Market, he bought himself a homemade hunting rifle, which was modified to function like a sawn-off shotgun, stashing the weapon under the driver's seat. His modus operandi was to pick up potential victims in Moscow's Eastern and Northeastern Districts, always at night and near his home. As a rule of thumb, he would only attack victims whom he thought had considerable riches, threatening to shoot them if they didn't give them up. If the victim resisted, he shot them with the sawn-off, dropping off the bodies on the side of the road and rummaging through their valuables, stealing only money and discarding the rest in garbage containers. He would use the stolen rubles to finance his family, saving up for a new car and apartment as well. =Chronology= * April 14, 2005: Elistratov picked up engineer Timofey Topolev-Soldunov on Zeleny Prospekt, with his destination being the Tverskaya Metro Station. He drove him to Zolotnoy Street, where he stopped the taxi and threatened him with the sawn-off shotgun. Topolev- Soldunov left behind 34,000 rubles and was frightened by the encounter, but was left unharmed, with his assailant quietly driving away. * October 16, 2005: 54-year-old Armenian national Leyla Ismailovna Ioanesyan, the owner of a small café on Basmannaya, was hitchhiking to get home and was picked up by Elistratov. He stopped the car on the Okruzhny Passage and demanded Ioanesyan give up her valuables. When she refused, he shot her and dumped the body under a railway bridge along the Entuziastov Highway, where it would later be found by another taxi driver. Her bag contained 43,000 rubles, the café's weekly earnings, along with dirty cloths and towels, which were thrown out. * March 6, 2006: he picked up haidresser Lyudmila Blokhina near the Entuziastov Highway, driving her to Sokolina Gora, where he stopped the taxi and threatened her. The frightened Blokhina left behind all her belongings and jumped out of the vehicle. She later contacted the police, but mistakenly identified her attacker as a Caucasian. Elistratov's bounty from this incident was a measely 700 rubles. * May 16, 2006: Elistratov picked up Armenian karate coach Artak Petrosyan on Spartakovskaya Street. When Artak resisted the mugging attempt, Alexander shot him in the stomach, tearing it apart. He then dumped the barely-alive Petrosyan near the All-Russian Exhibition Center in Prospekt Mira, driving away with the man's bag, which contained 1,000 rubles and some gym clothes. While Petrosyan managed to crawl to the nearby roadway to alert passers-by, whom called an ambulance, the doctors couldn't save him, and he died from his injuries in the hospital. According to the people who found him, he kept repeating something about the rubles, and the Russian taxi driver who had shot him. * August 9, 2006: he picked up saleswoman Anna Kuznetsova on Marshall Biryuzov Street, where he attempted to rob her. Kuznetsova actively resisted, causing Alexander to whip out his shotgun and shoot her. Despite her injuries, the woman continued to cling onto her bag, but was pushed out of the car and left to die. Miraculously, she was found by passers-by, who drove her to the hospital, where she managed to survive her near-fatal injuries. Elistratov's loot amounted to only 400 rubles. * August 10, 2006: the following day, the body of a young woman, believed to be between 20 and 25 years of age and possibly Armenian, was found on Novolesnaya Street. Despite the authorities' efforts, they couldn't establish her identity, and the victim remains unidentified. * October 17, 2006: Elistratov picked up 32-year-old Marina Tretyakova, from Kabardino-Balkaria, on Vlamirskaya Street, with her destination being Skhodnenskaya Metro Station, where her brother was waiting for her. Originally, a friend of hers had offered to call for a taxi, but Marina had decided to save some money by boarding the cheaper private ones. Along the way, she was shot, killed and robbed, with Elistratov dumping her body in a ditch near the Putilkovskoe Highway. * October 29, 2006: while driving around the Semyonovskaya Metro Station, Elistratov picked up 19-year- old Olga \\"Olya\\" Baydakova, a Muscovite of Greek descent who was a student at the Institute of Physical Education. An actress and fashion show participant, she was returning home after being appointed a toastmaster at a wedding. When the taxi reached the Entuziastov Highway, Elistratov shot and killed her, robbing her of her rubles and removing the body from the car, before calmly driving away. * January 16, 2007: on that night, Elistratov picked up his final victim on Chermyanskaya Street: he was Andrey Zhukov, the general director of a local publishing house. While on the way, Alexander demanded that he hand over his cash, and when Zhukov resisted, he was shot in the stomach. Noticing that a police patrol car was just across the road, he jumped out of the taxi and began waving his arms at the officers, shouting that the driver had hit him with a stun gun. Realising that he had been seen, Elistratov drove away in an attempt to escape, but was pursued by the officers. He accidentally found himself in a dead end, leaping out of the car and climbing over a fence with barbed wire. However, he got caught up in the wire, and the policemen arrested him on the spot. Meanwhile, Zhukov, who was left behind to wait for an ambulance, had already passed away as a result of his injuries. Trial and imprisonment The hunt for the so-called \\"Bloody Taxi Driver\\" stirred great controversy in the city, as, it would later turn out, the agencies could've captured the criminal much earlier and prevented any further bloodshed. On the body of one victim, a bloody newspaper was found which detailed the then-recent arrest of Alexander Pichushkin. In it, investigators noticed that an apartment number, 39, was stamped by a postman, and they subsequently checked every single apartment in the city which had that number. Astonishingly, they also visited the Elistratov family's home, but since Alexander wasn't officially registered as a citizen living in Moscow, but instead as still living in his hometown of Ulyanovsk, he managed to avoid arrest. During the subsequent investigations, Elistratov partially admitted guilt, claiming that he had killed the last victim, Zhukov, by negligence: according to him, Andrey started arguing with him, and had attempted to pull his sawn-off away from him when the weapon accidentally discharged. However, his claims were disregarded, and not long after, several blood samples which were found on his car were connected to the various murder victims. Elistratov was ordered an examination at the Serbsky Center, where he was found to be sane and completely aware of his actions, but was determined to have an aggressive personality. During his trial, he kicked a Kommersant journalist who was filming him. His refusal to divulge his motive for the murders led the Russian media to peddle various theories, varying from ethnic hatred (as the majority of his victims were foreigners or looked like ones) to envy against the working class, with some claiming that he prayed for his victims' soul in front of the icons in his home, and even that he had seen some of his future victims in his dreams, appearing before him in the forms of pigeons and doves. However, none of these were confirmed. On March 26, 2008, the Moscow City Court sentenced Alexander Elistratov to life imprisonment, with the verdict upheld by the Supreme Court of Russia. He is currently imprisoned at the Polar Owl Colony, from where he tried to unsuccessfully escape on June 3, 2011.

She is the co-founder and co-executive director US Youth Climate Strike; the nonprofit organization is dedicated towards raising awareness and demanding action concerning the climate crisis. She established it together with youth activists Alexandria Villaseñor and Isra Hirsi. She also writes for Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Haven Coleman is based in Denver, Colorado. She is a student of Denver Public Schools. Activism Coleman first felt the pull towards environmentalism when she was ten years old; after learning that her favorite animal, sloths, are diminishing due to deforestation. She then made significant lifestyle changes inspired by sustainable living. Her training at Climate Reality Project educated her further. After seeing the bold environmental activism of Greta Thunberg and youth climate strikes in Europe, she was inspired to do the same. Thus, since January 2019, at 13 years old, she began protesting in front of businesses or government buildings, such as the Colorado State Capitol. Every Friday she goes on strike to demand political action regarding air quality, coal plant retirement, renewable energy, etc. She also e-mailed elected officials concerning the issue. She was massively bullied by peers in school who thought her stark activism was strange. Coleman would protest alone until she was able to establish the US Youth Climate Strike together with Isra Hirsi and Alexandria Villasenor. Since then, climate strikes have been conducted across many states in the USA. On March 15, an international youth protest with over 120+ countries involved was held. Coleman went viral after speaking to state Senator Cory Gardner about carbon polluters on a public forum at the town hall. She implored him to take action and offered to organize a grassroots movement to facilitate, however, Gardner refused. As she made headlines, she caught the attention of Al Gore, and he invited her presence on his project, 24 Hours of Reality. It is a TV program that deals with climate change. Coleman is presently working on Arid Agency, which is geared towards accelerating environmental and social justice campaigns.

She was a radio and music hall singer releasing a great number of records. Early years Hamiyet Yüceses was born in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, to Halil and his wife Kadriye in 1915. She had an older sister Hayriye and a brother Emin. An older sister Saime, the daughter of her mother from her former marriage, lived with the family. She was schooled in (Bala Primary School) in Fatih district of Istanbul. Her father was in the hookah hose business. She was a young girl when her father's business failed and he went bankrupt. The family fell into poverty, and all their possessions were sold. Hamiyet acquired fame in the neighborhood for her beautiful singing voice. Encouraged by people around her, she took the stage in Burhaniye Balıkesir in 1927, at the age of eleven.. Her stage appearances continued in many places throughout Anatolia. She became famous in Gaziantep. The citizens of that southeastern Anatolian place liked her very much as she was their own and did not want her to move away. Career In the beginning of 1932, she returned to Istanbul, where her fame had spread. In 1934, she won a nationwide song contest. She signed a three-year contract with the (\\"London Brewery\\"), one of the city's two big musical halls. In the winter season she appeared in the music hall, and in the summer season at (\\"Small Farm\\"), the open-air music garden inside the Maçka Park, run by the same businessman. During this time period, she took the stage in a program of the soloist Safiye Ayla. She signed her first recording contract with the label His Master's Voice (EMI). Later, she sang for Columbia Records and Odeon Records. At the same time, she had weekly programs on the state-owned TRT Radio Istanbul, which was on the top floor of the Grand Post Office. She sang on around 500 gramophone records, 37 singles and 8 LP records. Meanwhile, she took singing lessons from notable musicians like Selahattin Pınar (1902–1960), Sadettin Kaynak (1895–1961), Mustafa Nafiz Irmak (1904–1975), Yesari Asım Ersoy (1900–1992), and Artaki Candan (1885–1948). Sadettin Kaynak composed songs suitable to her voice type such as \\"Kirpiklerinin Gölgesi güllerle Bezenmiş\\" (\\"The shadows of your eyelashes are adorned with roses\\"), \\"Kalplerden Dudaklara\\" (\\"From hearts to lips\\"), and \\"Benim olsan seni bir gül gibi koklar sararım (Yasemen)\\" (\\"I would scent you like a rose if you were mine (Jasmine)\\"). Between 1950 and 1956, she served on the executive committee of Turkish classical music at the Istanbul Conservatory. Private life In 1934, after the enacting of the Surname Law in Turkey, she adopted the family name Yüceses (\\"Almighty voice\\"), insistently recommended by Sadettin Kaynak and Selahattin Pınar. In 1940, she married Petty Officer Fethi. Her husband died in the disaster of submarine , which went down at Dardanelles on 14 July 1942. After her husband's death, she lamentingly sang \\"Gitti de Gelmeyiverdi Gözlerim Yolarda Kaldı\\" (\\"He's gone and did not show up, I have been waiting for a long time \\"), composed by Dede Efendi (1778–1846); many people thought that the classical song was her own work. She married businessman Kemal Mollaoğlu in 1944. The couple separated at the end of 1955. She married in 1956 to Osman Sabuncu, a young student of medicine, who asked her to sing the love song \\"Dîl harâb ı Aşkınım Sensin Sebep Berbâdıma\\" during a performance at Cumhuriyet Music Hall. Her third marriage lasted 40 years until her death. She was a mother of two. Later years and death Yüceses used the service of an artist manager for the first time in Turkey, a service provided by Mithat Babur which lasted from 1948 to 1955. As well as appearing on the stage in almost every city in Turkey, Yüceses gave concerts abroad, including in Beirut, Lebanon (1952), Israel (1959), Cyprus (1960), London, New York City (1971), and Germany. She made her last stage performances at Istanbul Hilton in 1981. She occasionally sang during an event at Pera Palace Hotel organized in 1987 to honor her. She gave her last concert during the (\\"Golden Butterfly\\") award ceremony of the newspaper Hürriyet held at the Atatürk Cultural Center. She ended her singing career in 1988. In 1995, she appeared in a television talk show of Halit Kıvanç and sang with renowned female singers Safiye Ayla, Müzeyyen Senar, Perihan Altındağ Sözeri and Zehra Bilir. This television program was her final performance. She spent her last years in Datça district of Muğla Province at the Turkish Riviera.

He was the first person to publish the only existing contemporary report of Vasco da Gama’s first trip to India. Background In the mid-17th century, the Kopke family controlled a significant portion of trade in Hamburg and, consequently, enjoyed considerable prestige in the context of the Hanseatic League, then composed of the free cities of Bremen, Lubeck, Danzig and Hamburg. In 1636, Nicholas Kopke became the first Consul General of the Hanseatic League in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, and soon after he established a branch of his business in Porto. Around 1730, Christian Kopke took up permanent residence in Porto, and became the Hanseatic League consul there. He married there and the many members of the Kopke family who have since lived in Porto are descended from him. The family became particularly well-known as exporters of port wine. The family’s records were destroyed by a fire in 1888 but it appears that Diogo Kopke was born in Porto on 16 February 1805, although other sources suggest 1808. He was the son of Diogo Kopke and Ana Barbosa Ayalla. He went to school in England and continued his studies at the University of Coimbra, where he graduated in Mathematics. Military career After schooling Kopke joined the army. In 1828 he went into exile, after having participated in the Liberal revolt in Porto on 16th May of that year. While in exile in France and England, he used the library at Rennes and collaborated with a local newspaper in Plymouth. Back in Portugal, he commanded several batteries during the Siege of Porto (1832-1833) and distinguished himself at the Battle of Asseiceira, being promoted to become Captain of the IV Artillery. Mathematics Kopke worked as a lecturer in mathematics at the Academica Politecnica do Porto. His particular interests were trigonometry, geodesy and theoretical and practical navigation, together with the use of astronomical instruments. He also taught at the Royal Academy of Navy and Commerce of Porto. It is likely that he was the source of Joseph James Forrester’s knowledge on trigonometry. He accompanied Forrester on trips up the Douro river that led to the preparation of two well-received topographical maps of the region and he reviewed Forrester’s work. Publishing Kopke was active as a journalist and wrote for various magazines, such as Diario do Governo, Gazeta Medica do Porto, and Museu Portuense. His teaching work gave him the time to edit and publish various historical texts. He made a catalogue of unpublished documents in the Porto Municipal Library and then, together with António da Costa Paiva, published the most notable. These included a text by João de Castro the fourth Viceroy of Portuguese India and one by the mathematician José Anastácio da Cunha. In 1838 he was the first person to publish the Journal of Vasco Da Gama's trip of 1497. Added to the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2013, this is the only surviving text about the journey, purported to have been written by two sailors who accompanied Da Gama, Álvaro Velho and João de Sá. Kopke often wrote long forewords or afterwords to the documents he published. =Editorial work and other publications= The publications written or edited and published by Kopke included: * Catalogo da Bibliotheca publica municipal do Porto. (Catalogue of the Public Municipal Library of Porto) * Carta Fisico matematica sobre a teoria da polvara em geral, e teoria do melhor comprimedo dos peços em particular.

Haywood wrote the play in roughly four weeks, and dedicated it to Frederick, Prince of Wales who had recently arrived in Britain from the country from Hanover. It was an effort to secure patronage from the royal family, based on the life of their Guelph ancestor, and was intended to coincide with the celebrations of Queen Caroline's birthday. However it was not a success, lasting for only three nights, something Haywood partly attributed to its lack of royal backing.King p.56-58 The original cast included Thomas Walker as Frederick, Lacy Ryan as Duke of Wirtemberg, Thomas Chapman as Ridolpho, James Quin as Count Waldec, William Milward as Anspach, Henrietta Morgan as Sophia, Elizabeth Buchanan as Anna and Anne Berriman as Adelaid.

He is a member of the Barghouti hamula. Barghouti is presently professor of Theoretical Space Plasma Physics at Al-Quds University, and resides in Beit Rima near Ramallah. A leading researcher in his field, he has authored 42 papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals. He has been arrested by Israeli authorities on several occasions and, in 2020, placed without trial under administrative detention, an Israeli military measure which allows the authorities to detain suspects without laying formal charges or providing public evidence. The measure can be renewed repeatedly without bringing the subject to trial, and is considered by the United Nations a violation of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Numerous scientists and scholars around the world have demanded his immediate release on several occasions. Career Barghouthi was born in 1962. After earning a doctorate in physics at Utah State University, he was employed and funded by NASA for a number of projects before taking up positions in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. He started teaching at al-Quds University in 2000 and gives courses on Advanced nuclear theory, Atomic and Molecular physics, the Theory of Electromagnetism and the Theory of relativity. His research papers, which concentrate on plasmic physics cover several topics ranging from the phenomenon of polar wind and ion outflow, Ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling to Coulomb collisions. He has written several papers on upper atmosphere ionosphere reactions. He has also set forth an hypothesis to explain the way oxygen ions are propagated from the earth's surface into space. History of arrests Barghouthi has voiced support for Hamas, the Palestinian authority ruling the Gaza Strip. He has been arrested for his stated opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on three occasions. =2014= During the Israel invasion on Gaza in 2014, at a rally on the 14 August in support of Hamas, Barghouthi called on Palestinians to \\"take up arms to defend their homes\\". A video of his comments was subsequently uploaded to YouTube. The comments were used to justify his arrest at the time. Palestinian figures after the war stated that of the 2,251 Gaza fatalities during the 51-day conflict 1,462 were civilians. Two months later, in October, he praised Hamas's Izz ad-Din al- Qassam Brigades, called upon Palestinians to resist the occupation and liberate Muslim holy places such as Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa. Later that year, on 6 December, while he was en route to attending the 11th Arab Conference on Astronomy and Space Sciences (an organization he helped to found,) at the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, Israeli border authorities arrested him at the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan. He was released on 18 January 2015, after the directors of Euroscience addressed a letter of concern to the then Israeli ambassador to France, Yossi Gal, stating that in the absence of public evidence, the group considered his detention as a serious infringement of academic freedom. The group also requested that the Israeli government come forth at short notice with information as to where he was being held, his state of health and the reasons for his detention. The nature of the reasons for his detention at this time were, according to Middle East Eye, unknown. In a later interview with the journal Nature, Barghouthi stated that his problems started when he began to express his opposition to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and when he uploaded on his Facebook profile a picture of himself wearing the green scarf and hat of Hamas. =2016= Barghouthi was re-arrested on 24 April 2016 at an Israeli checkpoint close to the village of Nabi Saleh, as he was travelling home, and held without charges. Eventually he was kept in detention for three months. In early May the army clarified that they considered him a 'significant security threat' and, as such, thereby warranted being kept under administrative detention. An Israeli court dismissed the case on 26 May for lack of evidence and stated he was to be released on the following Sunday. 29 May. Just three days before his release date Israeli military authorities filed charges that he was culpable of incitement and argued he be moved to Ofer Prison. His release order was cancelled and he was subsequently transferred to a facility run by the Shin Bet for further interrogation, and eventually prosecuted for incitement on Facebook. According to the Palestinian Information Center, at the time there was no statute in Israeli law allowing criminal charges to be laid for what people write online. His lawyer later revealed that the evidence produced in court included the number of 'likes' and shares' his Facebook posts received. He was sentenced in September to six months in prison by an Israeli military court for incitement on Facebook and fined $500 (6,000 shekels), becoming one of 150 Palestinians arrested or imprisoned for comments on that medium since October 2015. After an international uproar, he was released after serving one month. =2020= On 16 July 2020, Barghouthi was detained at an Israeli checkpoint near 'Anata while driving home. No charge was laid against him at the time, but a court hearing was arranged for July 23. On 2 August he was arraigned before a court on a double charge of incitement and support of organizations hostile to Israel. One element in the indictment listed as evidence an allegation that Barghouthi had praised a member of his family connected to the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing two decades earlier. On 10 August he made public a letter requesting either his release or conditions of detention that would enable him to teach online and continue to supervise his graduate students in the academic year beginning September. The presiding judge in his case ruled for his release on bail on 2 September. Some hours before his scheduled release the Israeli West Bank military commander placed him under the administrative detention regime for another four months. He is scheduled to appear before a military judge on 15 November, in a session closed to the public. Reactions Barghouthi's arrest in late 2014 stirred protests as an infringement of such fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of movement from the French Association of Academics for the Respect of International Law in Palestine, the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine, and the US-based Committee of Concerned Scientists. Barghouthi's most recent arrest has been interpreted as part of a wider pattern, with the administrative detention of American Palestinian academic Ubai Aboudi, executive director of the Bisan Center for Research and Development in late 2019, and the arrest of Suhail Khoury and Rania Eliaa, a couple who direct classical music cultural associations in East Jerusalem and of writer Ahmad Qatamesh. Sahar Francis of Addameer ('Conscience') a Palestinian Prisoner Support and Human Rights NGO has claimed that the detention of major Palestinian cultural figures reflects an objective to repress civil society in Palestine, undermine the growth of its soft power by systematically erasing anything east of Jerusalem that expresses symbolically or otherwise a desire for self-determination. Barghouthi's arrest in 2016 was the occasion for an international petition protesting his treatment and demanding his immediate release. Over 350 academic and professional colleagues signed the petition, among them Freeman Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton; Fields Medal laureate David Mumford, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Brown University; Chandler Davis, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of Toronto and Noam Chomsky. The recent (2018) Nobel laureate in Chemistry George P. Smith has stated that:- > \\"The repeated arrest of one of Palestine's most active and prominent > scientists is a direct attack to Palestinian's right to science protected > under article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which > Israel is a signatory, as well as the article 15 of the International > Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The violation of the right > to science anywhere is an attack to scientists everywhere\\". Personal Barghouthi is the father of five children and has one grandchild.

He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the United States for his service during World War II in the Solomon Islands campaign and the New Guinea campaign. His experiences and reports have become an important source for historians regarding the history of the coastwatchers. Early Life Read was born on 18 September 1905 in Hobart to William George Read and Eleanor Elfridine, (née Absolom). He attended Hobart State High School and after worked as a bookkeeper. In 1929, he married Gwenneth Ballantyne in 1929 before leaving for public service in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. He and Gwen had one child together, Judith. Read served his cadetship in New Britain; in 1932 he was promoted to patrol officer and stationed in Madang. In 1936 he was promoted to assistant district officer and continued to serve in Madang, as well as Wau and Lae in the Morobe Province. World War II Madang Province and its capital was first colonized by Germany in the late 19th century and German colonial rule lasted until the end of World War I. When World War II began in Europe, Australia began interning foreign nationals suspected of Axis sympathies. Read was involved in taking German and Italian miners into custody in preparation for their deportation and internment in Australia. He applied for release from colonial service to enter the military, but this was denied and he assigned to the Buka Passage sub-district and sent to Bougainville Island where his duties included coastwatching. Read had risen to the rank of sergeant in the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit; he was initially inclined to join the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1942 but was convinced by Eric Feldt, the naval intelligence officer in charge of the Coastwatcher service in New Guinea and the Solomons to remain in his post. Feldt had also been a district officer at Madang, and knew Read well from their mutual service. Shortly after this he was appointed as a lieutenant in the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve. In this position he created a coastwatching network in Bougainville to gather intelligence on Japanese movements. Due to his ideal position along the coast, his intelligence was to be especially valuable to the Allies during the initial phase of the Solomon Islands campaign. Ian W. Toll writes in The Conquering Tide: War in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944: > For the second consecutive day, a coastwatcher had provided vital > forewarning of an incoming airstrike. It was a pattern that would continue > throughout the Solomons campaign. Every day, or nearly so, the Japanese sent > airstrikes down from Rabaul—and every day, Jack Read or Paul Mason spotted > the southbound formations overhead and relayed the warning. Read was > especially well situated for this purpose because his vantage point at > Porapora commanded a panoramic view of all of Buka Island to the north, the > eastern sea channels leading down the “Slot” (the body of water between the > double file of islands that formed the Solomons archipelago), and the skies > through which Japanese aircraft must pass. This vital information denied the Japanese the advantage of a surprise attack and gave the Allies time to prepare for the incoming Japanese airstrike, by defensively dispersing their ships, manning anti-aircraft stations, and having their fighters in the air and ready to defend the fleet and the landings against the attack. The Japanese were aware of the intelligence-gathering activities of the coastwatches and it became a top priority to find and capture them; as spies, they would have been quickly executed if they weren't killed during their capture for their activities. Read was nearly killed on one occasion and had to change locations often. He was constantly assisted by local villagers who both helped him evade capture, assisted with his intelligence-gathering activities, and provided him with priceless knowledge of the local environment. Eventually with the Japanese closing in on him, he was evacuated by the United States in July 1943 on the submarine USS Guardfish, which also rescued other coastwatchers and Australian civilians. One of Read's final acts before being evacuated was to coordinate and assist with the evacuation of the civilians who had assisted him. On July 24, the day he was supposed to have been evacuated he discovered that no plans had been made to evacuate the indigenous police and civilians who had served with him. Having risked their lives for him, Read stated \\"There was no way I was going to leave without them.\\" The Guardfish returned on July 30 and Read, along with the indigenous peoples who had assisted him, were evacuated. On October 7, 1942, Read was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the United States for \\"extraordinary heroism\\" in service to the United States for his intelligence gathering during the Solomon Islands landing. Admiral William F. Halsey, the United States Navy commander for the South Pacific, stated that the intelligence gathered by Read on Bougainville had \\"saved Guadalcanal and that Guadalcanal had saved the South Pacific\\" Read was never honored by Australia or Britain for his service, a slight he attributed to prejudice against irregulars by the Australian Navy. Read was commissioned as a Major by the Australian Imperial Forces in September 1944 and served in the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit as acting district officer on Bougainville. Post World War II After the war, Read joined the administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in the position of assistant district officer. He was stationed in Kavieng, New Ireland. He remained in this position until May 3, 1951, to take up a civilian appointment in Melbourne with the Department of the Navy. However, he was unsatisfied with life away for Papua New Guinea and returned in 1952 to take up a position as Native (indigenous) Land Commissioner. In this position, he researched local indigenous histories and determined the land rights of individuals or communities based on hereditary or customary rights. He retired from this position in 1975 and left for Australia when Papua New Guinea gained independence. He retained his commission with the Australian Naval Reserve, was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1950 and eventually retired from naval service in 1963. In Australia, he would live in Melbourne with his wife pursuing his interest in photography. After over 50 years of marriage, his wife Gwen passed away in 1980 and he moved to Ballarat to be close to his only child Judith. After an extended illness, he died of lung disease on 29 June 1992 at Ballarat and was cremated. Further reading Books * Feldt, E. (1946). The Coast Watchers.

The 1,400 MW HVDC connector would link Kingsnorth National Grid substation in north Kent, England, with RTE Warande substation in Bourbourg (Nord) near Dunkerque in northern France. Description Electricity interconnectors are high-voltage transmission links, linking two electricity grids. Electricity can flow in both directions, allowing a grid to import electricity when it is running short so it does not have to fire up up old, inefficient fossil fuel power stations. Renewable sources are dependent on the time of day and on the weather conditions; the required load can be balanced by interconnecting grids over a large region, in this case over the Northern Seas Offshore Grid, and the North–South Western EU Interconnections. The project to build this 1400-megawatt (1.4 GW interconnector) comprises of *140 km submarine cable (108 km in UK waters and 32 km in French territorial waters) working at a DC voltage of approximately 525 kV. *Underground cables from the shoreline to the convertor station at Kingsnorth and Warande. *Convertor stations in Kingsnorth and Warande where the HVDC voltage is converted to 400 kV AC, which is the working voltage of both the networks. *Underground high-voltage connector cables from the convertor stations to the UK and French networks *An additional substation in France. The projected timescale is: :Awarded Project of Common Interest status (PCI) by European Commission 23 November 2017 (Commission Delegated Regulation 2018/540) :Application for UK development consents September 2020, and in France November 2020. :Construction contracts to be awarded July 2021, detailed planning consents September 2021. :Construction starts December 2021 :Commissioning June 2024 :Commercial operations start December 2024 Route The undersea cable connects two national grids, so must run from locations, close to the coast, capable of injecting the extra 1.4 gigawatts of power into the grid. Three points in Northern France were considered Penly, Les Attaques and Warande. Only Warande had sufficient capacity. On the UK side sites along the south coast were rejected as there was not sufficient infrastructure available to transport the electricity to the main network, while the North Kent coast and the banks of Thames Estuary was well supported. The following seven suitable sites were considered before Kingsnorth was selected: Cleve Hill, Coryton, Grain, Kemsley, Kingsnorth, Northfleet East and Rayleigh Main. The existing Kingsnorth sub-station already had the capacity, as the Kingsnorth coal fired power station had been decommissioned, and was 1.5 km from the shore. The 400 kV AC link from the substation at Kingsnorth passes though a 1.5 km underground duct to the converter station which is on the shoreline. The two HVDC undersea cables enter a trench under the sea perpendicular to the shore and under the shipping channel where it follows the southern bank until off Grain where it crosses the channel and leaves the Medway passing to the north of the Sheppey anchorage berths. The 140 km cable lies on the seabed protected by a covering of rocks or in a trench so shallow but not too shallow water is desirable; other users must not be disrupted, and a series of hazards must be avoided: anchorages, navigation channels, environmentally sensitive areas, known wrecks, moving sandbanks, unexploded ordnance, windfarms and other subsea cables. The route was chosen to take all this into account, and to turn south on the most western route to minimise cable length. In the Thames, it runs to the south of the Pan Sands sand bank and south of the BritNed interconnector cable. In France the HVDC cable crosses the coastline in an industrial area owned by the Grand Maritime Port of Dunkerque (GMPD) and passes under their land for 10 km to a site alongside the RD11 junction (52a/b) with the A16 autoroute to the new converter station. The 400 kV AC link travels 3 km underground to the new Warande substation that is to be built adjacent to the existing RTE Bourbourg substation; they will share connection to the 400 kV AC overhead lines of the RTE.

It was published in 2020, initially by the micropublisher Monstrograph, and later by a major publishing company, Éditions du Seuil.  Contents  In the 96-page booklet, Harmange aims to \\"understand misandry and to give it back the right to exist.\\" According to her, feminists have always needed to pretend not to hate men so as not to lose them as allies. But in her view, misandry is not only \\"perfectly justified, but also necessary\\". She advises women to reduce their relationships with men and toxic masculinity, in order to rediscover the benefits of the \\"sisterhood\\" among women.  Publication history  In September 2020, Mediapart reported that Ralph Zurmély, a special adviser to the French ministry for gender equality, wrote to the publisher demanding a retraction of the essay, threatening criminal prosecution for \\"incitement to hatred on the grounds of gender\\". Monstrograph refused to do so, and the government disavowed Zurmély's demand as a \\"personal initiative\\". The French media response to the attempt at censorship was largely negative. NouvelObs called it an example of \\"cancel culture\\" and wrote that the state had not so far attempted to suppress the publication of misogynist texts. In an example of the Streisand effect, the controversy led to skyrocketing demand for the book, which had initially been printed in only 400 copies. It is republished by a major publisher, Éditions du Seuil, in october 2020.

It can be a career that combines multiple paid and/or voluntary roles. The philosopher and organisational behaviourist Charles Handy popularised the \\"portfolio\\" concept in works like his 1994 book The Empty Raincoat. Handy's recognition of the portfolio career-path came about when he realised that individuals would be required to develop portable skillsets to meet the needs of a fast-moving future workplace. https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/how-to-become-a-portfolio-worker/ His prediction foresaw what is now known as the gig economy.https://www.ft.com/content/8d6bad56-d42a-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77 Portfolio careers are often found in the creative industries where freelancing is the norm.

The season began on 12 September 2020 and the ten teams will compete in a 36-game regular season ending in February 2021. The season marks the return to play for the SDHL after the 2019–20 season championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden.  League Business  = Background = Both Modo Hockey and Göteborg HC had survived relegation in 2019–20 SDHL season, having defeated the Skellefteå AIK and the Malmö Redhawks of the Damettan in the 2020 promotion to the SDHL playoffs. HV71 had finished at the top of the league table during the 2019–20 regular season, and were due to face-off against Luleå HF/MSSK in the playoff championships before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. = Partnerships = During the 2020 summer off-season, the league announced the extension of the sponsorship with DHL, the league's main sponsor. In October 2020, the league launches an online merchandise store in collaboration with DHL. Spendrups brewery Norrlands Guld extended their sponsorship rights over the SDHL Goal of the Week, voted for by the public. In August, the league announced an expansion of its partnership with the men's Swedish Hockey League (SHL) through 2024, with an increase in investment of several million kronor. = Collective bargaining = In September, the players' association, SICO, announced the league's first-ever collective bargaining agreement between the players, the league and the Swedish national team, providing injury insurance for both league and international games along with aid for education and job- finding post-retirement. The agreement enters into force on the 1st of October 2020.https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/a/weEKrA/historia-skrivs-i- svensk-damhockey = Media Rights = C More Entertainment acquired the broadcasting rights for the season's games, with 20 regular season games and 10 playoff games (including the championship finals) to be broadcast live by the national broadcaster SVT. The C More broadcasting team will include former Olympic silver medal winnter Pernilla Winberg, along with former NHLer Staffan Kronwall, and journalist Kajsa Kalméus. = COVID-19 impact = Along with the men's SHL and HockeyAllsvenskan, the SDHL presented a plan to allow a limited audience for games. The league will implement personalised tickets as well as blocking off rows of seats to ensuring physical distancing, and fan associations will not be allowed to organise trips to away games. Several clubs, including HV71 and Djurgården, opted to keep matches closed to the public, whether others opted to go ahead and sellup to 50 tickets.https://hockeysverige.se/2020/09/12/enkat-sa-loser-sdhl-klubbarna- publikfragan The Swedish Ice Hockey Association further set guidelines that a minimum of five players should be suspected of infection with COVID-19 before a match can be suspended.https://www.aftonbladet.se/senastenytt/ttsport/sport/a/KyvzX5/beskedet- sa-blir-hockeyns-coronariktlinjer In October, the Swedish government announced plans to allow up to 500 spectators to attend sporting events, but soon backed down from the plan due to increasing case numbers in the country.https://hockeysverige.se/2020/10/08/bakslaget-inget-nytt-besked-i- publikfragan Later that month, the SDHL announced a partnership with Dynamic Code to improve testing for players and personnel.https://www.sdhl.se/artikel/9xabakfza-5nfcdd/sdhl-i-samarbete-med- dynamic-code-for-testning-av-covid-19 Because the average SDHL salary is 5,500kr (compared to 121,000kr for the SHL), many SDHL players have second jobs outside of hockey and have been affected by cutbacks in the COVID-19 recession.  Regular Season  = Format = Each team plays 36 games, with three points being awarded for winning in regulation time, two points for winning in overtime or shootout, one point for losing in overtime or shootout, and zero points for losing in regulation time. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points is crowned the regular season champion, and the top eight teams proceed to a playoff tournament. The two bottom-ranked teams proceed to a relegation tournament against the top two teams from the Damettan. The top two teams from the tournament qualify for the SDHL and the bottom two teams play in the Damettan in the next season, meaning that it is possible for one or both of the SDHL teams to be relegated and one or both of the Damettan teams to be promoted. = Significant Events = * Pre-season: SDE Hockey goaltender Sofia Reideborn leaves the league after making a controversial podcatst;https://www.theicegarden.com/2020/7/13/21322608/goaltender-sofia- reideborn-leaves-sdhl-sde-after-controversial-podcast Luleå HF/MSSK all-time scorer Michelle Karvinen leaves the league to sign in Switzerland; former NHLer and Sveriges Radio commentator Per Svartvadet suggests that the SDHL could limit the number of foreign players per teamhttps://hockeysverige.se/2020/09/10/vill-begransa-antalet-utlandska- spelare-i-sdhl * Week 1: Linköping HC beat AIK 3-2 in the first match of the season; Luleå HF/MSSK beat HV71 4-0 in first rematch of the cancelled 2019-20 playoff finals; Modo Hockey forward Marion Allemoz scores first hat-trick of the season in 5-1 victory against Göteborg HC; SDE Hockey goaltender Lindsey Post posts 52-save shutout against Djurgårdens IF; newly appointed Swedish Ice Hockey Association general-secretary Johan Stark called for the men's and women's national teams to receive equal conditions;https://www.svt.se/sport/ishockey/nya-hockeypampen-forbundet-maste- kanna-ett-ansvar-for-damerna Brynäs IF forward Anna Meixner earns the Goal of Week awardhttps://www.sdhl.se/artikel/qq02akfck-5nfcdd/vinnare-av-veckans-mal- vecka-37-anna-meixner * Week 2: HV71 forward Danielle Stone posts 5-point game against Göteborg HC; the first collective bargaining agreement between the players and the league is announced;https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/a/weEKrA/historia- skrivs-i-svensk-damhockey SDE forward Kayleigh Hamers earns the Goal of the Week awardhttps://www.sdhl.se/artikel/tax0akfm8-5nfcdd/vinnare-av-veckans-mal- vecka-38-kayleigh-hamers * Week 3: Brynäs IF defeats Luleå 7-4 to become the sole remaining undefeated team on the season; 19-year old Göteborg goaltender Frida Axell posts 51 save game as Göteborg earn their first point of the season; Ulf Lundberg is announced as new head coach of the Swedish national teamhttps://www.svt.se/sport/ishockey/nya-forbundskaptenen-klubbarna-maste- anstranga-sig-for-att-valja-svenskor * Week 4: The Swedish government announces its intention to relax COVID-19 restrictions, allowing up to 500 spectators for sporting events starting from the 15th of October, but ultimately cancels the relaxations due to a rise in cases * Week 6: Göteborg head coach Stefanie McKeough is forced to leave the club and return to Canada due to visa issues;https://www.svt.se/sport/ishockey/ordforanden-hon-mar- javligt-daligt the SDHL launches its webshop;https://www.sdhl.se/artikel/ih9hakg84-5nfcdd/dhl-skapar-unik-webbshop- samtliga-intakter-gar-oavkortat-till-flick-och-tjejhockeyn = Standings =  See also  * Women's ice hockey in Sweden  References   External links  * League website (in Swedish) Category:Current ice hockey seasons Category:2020–21 in women's ice hockey Category:2020–21 in Swedish ice hockey Category:2020–21 in European ice hockey leagues Category:Women's ice hockey competitions in Sweden Category:2020–21 in Swedish ice hockey leagues ","title":"2020–21 SDHL season"},{"id":"65277250","text":"Leukomyelitis, also known as acute spasmodic paraplegia, is a disorder of the central nervous system.

History Breitenbush Hot Springs Sweat House in 1923 Upper hot spring pool, Breitenbush Hot Springs The hot springs in this geothermal area were used for centuries by the Indigenous people in the region, the Kalapuya, Wasco, and Molalla, for medicinal and spiritual purposes. Settlers began using the springs in the 1840s. In 1873, a Williamette Valley farmer John Minto, a Willamette Valley statesman and farmer began developing a transportation route over the Cascade Mountains, wrote in a 1903 memoire, that Henry States, Frank Cooper, and himself had named hot springs after meeting a one-armed hunter named John Breitenbush, who was camping near the hot springs. In 1938, a man named Frederick Breitenbusher claimed that this was his pioneer father, Lewis Breitenbusher. Since 1873, the shortened name Breitenbush rather than Breitenbusher has been used for the springs. In 1897, John Hollingsworth began managing the hot springs and in 1904 the upper and lower pools became two separate soaking areas. In the same year a grant for the upper hot springs was issued to Claude Mansfield by president Theodore Roosevelt. In the 1910s, a Salem resident, Mark Skiff, was issued a Forest Service permit to develop the lower hot springs into a commercial establishment, named Skiff's camp. The upper springs were purchased in 1927, by the Bruckman family who further developed the springs to include a large pool and local amenities. In the 1970s the upper and lower facilities were destroyed in a flood. In 1977, the upper springs were purchased by Alex Beamer, and later rebuilt into a retreat and conference center. The lower springs remain in a primitive state with the remains of the soaking pools as well as natural rock pools. Water profile The geothermally heated water emerges from over thirty springs at 356 °F (180 °C), and cool to between 198 °F (92 °C) and 150°F (65°C) at the surface. The mineral content includes analcime, anhydrite, calcite, calcium, chalcedony, lithium, magnesium, microcline, muscovite, sodium, sulfate, potassium, and quartz. Geology The Breitenbush hot springs geothermal area is located on the boundary between the Western Cascade late-Tertiary rocks and the High Cascade rocks which are younger in geological age. The Western Cascade rock formations include the pumice-rich, crystal-vitric Breitenbush Tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, the Detroit Beds, and mudflow breccia. The Breitenbush Tuff is covered by the basaltic lava and breccia of the Outerson Formation. Erosion has occurred in many of the volcanic landforms, but the residuum of the High Cascade volcanoes are still recognizable. Location The springs are located in the Willamette National Forest. The Lower Breitenbush hot springs area us are on public land managed by the USDA Forest Service; and are not to be confused with the resort establishment, Breitenbush Hot Springs, where some of the the upper hot springs are located on private property and are accessible only to paying guests of the commercial establishment.

According to the British Medical Journal, the programme aims to deliver 10 million tests per day by 2021. The programme has raised concerns because of its expected cost—£100bn according to a leaked government document, which is about three-quarters of the total annual cost of NHS England. Statisticians have moreover warned that given the inaccuracies inherent in any test, mass testing at this scale is liable to cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told that they are infected when they are not. Description The test being proposed for the programme relies on saliva samples to give a positive or negative reading within minutes, rather than requiring analysis at a laboratory, a process that can take several days. In this way, it is described by media, including the Sheffield Telegraph, as being similar to a pregnancy test. In making a test of this type available, it is projected to negate the need for people to travel to a test centre, something that can require a lengthy journey. Oxford Nanopore has been contracted to deliver millions of tests based on a novel testing method called Transcriptase Loop Amplification (LAMP) that is currently under development; it is hoped that these tests will be able to deliver a result in less than an hour. History The project was announced at a Downing Street briefing by Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, on 9 September 2020. Johnson suggested that mass testing would be a way to allow sports and entertainment venues to reopen again following their closure at the beginning of the pandemic, and for the possibility of people to gather for Christmas parties. Up to that point, scientists had used testing to identify people giving a positive result for the virus, but Johnson outlined what he described as \\"the 'Moonshot\\" approach\\", a test that would show people who are negative and do not pose a potential risk to others, thus giving them a \\"freedom pass\\" to attend events and gather with others \\"in a pre-Covid way\\". A pilot scheme was announced for indoor and outdoor events in Salford, Greater Manchester, set to begin in October, with plans for a national rollout after that. About a week before Johnson's announcement, Matt Hancock, the Secretary of State for Health, had announced that the government would provide funding worth £500m for the development of a saliva test that would produce a result within 20 minutes. Such tests would be used at work places and leisure venues to regularly test those entering the facility. The programme has a target of providing 10 million tests per day by 2021, giving it the capacity to test the entire population of the United Kingdom each week, with GP surgeries and pharmacies utilised to make public access to testing much easier. Several private sector firms were signed up to the programme, including GSK for the provision of tests, AstraZeneca for laboratory capacity, and Serco and G4S for storage and logistics. One of the government's advisers on rapid testing is Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina, who suggested a similar \\"moonshot\\" in the United States. By 13 October 2020, the Salford pilot scheme – originally envisaged to involve regular testing of all 254,000 residents – had been significantly scaled back, with government sources saying it would now be \\"focused on high-risk environments and groups\\", with testing offered to residents \\"in some areas of high-density housing\\". Reception The announcement quickly attracted scrutiny from scientists and health experts, who voiced their doubt as to whether testing several million people daily with a quick turnaround was achievable with laboratory capacity as it stood at the time. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser said it would be \\"completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk that can definitely happen\\", while Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, said the programme's success would depend on how it was handled. Opposition politicians, including Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health, questioned the programme's feasibility when the system was already struggling to cope with the volume of tests required of it. Responding to concerns, Grant Shapps, the Secretary of State for Transport, said that the technology to implement the system did not yet exist. =Programme cost= On 10 September 2020, the British Medical Journal quoted a leaked document that forecast the process would cost £100bn—relatively close to the £130bn total annual cost of NHS England. The fact that the plans appeared to involve a substantial proportion of this sum being paid to private businesses attracted comment. Devi Sridhar (University of Edinburgh) said, \\"There is a case for giving the extra billions to the NHS and asking it to deliver. I have concerns around the bidding process for these contracts. The procurement process isn’t clear, and it allows for a lot of people getting rich off this crisis.\\" Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization, spoke on Twitter of \\"waste/corruption on a cosmic scale\\". Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, wondered what parliamentary scrutiny there would be on spending. The Good Law Project initiated legal action against the government, arguing the programme is unlawful because it \\"involves potentially huge private contracts that may not have been tendered and breaks the government's own value-for-money rules. The government's own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said, in a Consensus Statement dated 31 August 2020, it was important \\"to ensure that any mass testing programme provides additional benefit over investing equivalent resources into (i) improving the speed and coverage of NHS Test and Trace for symptomatic cases [...] and (ii) the rate of self-isolation and quarantine for those that test positive (currently estimated to be <20% fully adherent)\\"; it added that \\"mass testing can only lead to decreased transmission if individuals with a positive test rapidly undertake effective isolation.\\" Martin McKee said the programme \\"focuses on only one part of the problem, testing, and says nothing about what will happen to those found positive, a particular concern given the low proportion of those who do adhere to advice to isolate—in part because of the lack of support they are offered.\\" The government said in response to queries that £500 million had been committed so far, and that final costs were as yet unknown. =Danger of false positives in mass testing= Another issue raised by statisticians such as David Spiegelhalter (University of Cambridge) is that mass testing is known to generate false positives. Professor Jon Deeks (University of Birmingham, Cochrane) stated that even if a test were to achieve a very good specificity of 99%, meaning that only 1% of healthy people would be wrongly identified as infected, testing the entire population of the UK would result in over half a million people being told they had to self-isolate, along with their contacts. False positives might end up outnumbering actual infected people at a ratio of 1,000 to 1, according to Deeks' estimates. A paper published by SAGE suggested the programme could lead to 41% of the UK population having to self-isolate needlessly within six months due to false positives, and warned of potential school closures and workers' losing their wages through incorrect test results. On 11 September 2020, these concerns were echoed by the Royal Statistical Society, which warned in a letter to The Times that the plan \\"does not seem to take account of fundamental statistical issues\\" and risked \\"causing personal and economic harm to tens of thousands of people.\\" =Expertise= Academics seeing the leaked documents expressed concern about the apparent lack of input \\"from scientists, clinicians, and public health and testing and screening experts.\\" On 11 September 2020, The Guardian reported that the National Screening Committee, which normally advises government and the NHS on \\"all aspects of population screening\\", had not been consulted on the plans. Allyson Pollock (Newcastle University) stated she found this incomprehensible as many UK experts were available. Jon Deeks added, \\"There is massive cause for concern that there is no screening expertise evident in the documents. They are written by management consultants.\\" References Category:COVID-19 pandemic in England Category:2020 establishments in England Category:National Health Service (England) Category:Scientific and technical responses to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Medical responses to the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"Operation Moonshot"},{"id":"65277574","text":"The 2019–20 Guam Soccer League (slso known as the Budweiser Soccer League for sponsorship reasons) is the 31st season of Guam Soccer League, Guam's first- tier professional soccer league.

The name refers to its construction, which combines a traveling wave tube, or TWT, with a klystron, producing a tw-ystron. The name was originally a trademark of Varian Associates, its developer, and was often capitalized. In recent times has become a generic term for any similar design. The twystron amplifies a source signal using a conventional klystron, which consists of a series of cylindrical resonant chambers fed with the source signal. An electron gun at one end of the tube produces electrons that flow through a holes in the centers of the resonators. As they pass through the holes, the signal within the resonator causes the electrons to \\"bunch up\\", a process known as velocity-modulation. The resulting electron beam is an amplified version of the original signal. In a conventional klystron, this signal is then captured and used as the output. In the twystron, the output instead flows into a TWT for further amplification. The advantage of this approach is that while the multi-resonator klystron is an efficient amplifier, its bandwidth is reduced as one adds additional resonators, which makes high- power klystrons have a relatively low bandwidth generally less than 10% of the design frequency. In contrast, the TWT has a wider bandwidth response but are generally very long. By combining a klystron with a TWT, the result is a relatively compact device with improved bandwidth; typical twystrons have bandwidth up to 15% of the design point. The device was developed by Albert La Rue and Rodney Rubert in the early 1960s and was quickly adopted by many radar designs in order to improve frequency agility and thereby improve performance against radar jamming systems. The twystron was generally replaced by the extended interaction klystron and solid state amplifiers.

The book deals with the difficulty some children might face when learning how to write. Alexander was awarded the Young Readers' Schneider Family Book Award in 2013 for her work.  Premise  Students in a reading circle are invited to the principal's birthday party. Their teacher suggests they write the principal a \\"Happy Birthday\\" card. While trying to write the card, one of the students realizes his letters will sometimes be back to front, sometimes upside down and sometimes won't look like letters at all.  Reception  The book received mixed reviews, with one of them noting that it could be specially useful for students with dyslexia. Writing for Kirkus Reviews, the author comments that the handwritten letters found throughout the book can be hard to read, and shouldn't be emulated by readers. They also note that the character's fast improvement is \\"too good to be true\\", but ends the review by saying the book's message that everyone needs to ask for help sometimes is very clear. Alexander was praised for using progressively darker colors for the drawings to convey the character's \\"emotional turmoil and isolation\\" due to their inability to write the card and fear to ask for help. In 2013, Back to Front and Upside Down! was awarded the Young Readers' Schneider Family Book Award. The book also received the Paterson Prize for \\"Continued Excellence in Children's Literature\\", awarded by the Passaic County Community College's Poetry Center.

The release has been met with positive reception by critics, particularly with the album's ability to face mortality and aging in a profound manner. Recording and release Springsteen assembled the E Street Band at his home studio for five days of recording in November 2019 but finished after just four. The recordings were produced by Ron Aniello and Springsteen and come after a period of writer's block that the musician had which spontaneously broke over the course of a week and a half of intense songwriting in April 2019. The album was recorded live in studio, with no overdubs and features three tracks that were originally written prior to Springsteen's 1973 debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, N. J.: \\"If I Was the Priest\\", \\"Janey Needs a Shooter\\", and \\"Song for Orphans\\". Springsteen came across earlier recordings of these songs with John Hammond while assembling a compilation album. \\"If I Was the Priest\\" has not previously been released by Springsteen but was covered by Allan Clarke in the 1970s. Photography for the cover and liner notes was captured by Danny Clinch in late 2018 as Springsteen was in New York City for his stage show Springsteen on Broadway. The band assumed they would tour to support the record starting in early 2021 but those plans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic; by the time of the release, Spingsteen estimated that the earliest they could perform live would be 2022. EStreet drummer Max Weinberg continued touring with his group Max Weinberg's Jukebox and use those dates to promote Letter to You. The release was announced on September 10, with a music video for lead single \\"Letter to You\\" released simultaneously. Streaming audio and a music video for \\"Ghosts\\" followed on September24. A documentary on making the album, which was directed by Thom Zimny, is scheduled to be released to Apple TV+ on October23. An emoji in the shape of Springsteen was released via Twitter to promote the album on October14. Critical reception With three reviews, aggregator Album of the Year sums up critical consensus as a 90 out of 100. Alex McLevy of The A. V. Club gave the album an A rating, calling it \\"one of the finest achievements of Bruce Springsteen’s career\\" for the songwriting's profound look at loss and the fact that listeners can hold up \\"nearly any track as a microcosm of its overall scope\\". Kory Grow of Rolling Stone awarded this four out of five stars for Springsteen's deep ability to express his emotions in the \\"self-therapy\\" of the lyrics and sums up the music as \\"the sound of Springsteen accepting that for himself\\". Richard Williams of Uncut devotes a lengthy review of Letter to You that places it in the context of Springsteen's career as a milestone release that is ultimately about Springsteen, his relationship with his band, and their relationship with the audience, particularly in their ability to interpret American culture, history, and politics; he gives it a nine out of 10. Writing for the Associated Press, David Bauder has a mixed take on the material, noting how it's ironic that the composer of \\"Glory Days\\" spends so much time looking back and while Springsteen \\"is not, by any means, a nostalgia act\\", between this album and his Broadway show, his current output \\"is less about pulling out of here to win than pulling back in to appreciate what he has\\"; the review praises some songs but notes that Springsteen sometimes slips into cliché. IndieWire's David Ehrlich reviewed the documentary, characterizing it as a \\"rockin’ meditation on death\\" which is also \\"an upbeat portrait of someone who isn’t going anywhere, even when he leaves us\\"; he gave the film a B rating. In Time, Stephanie Zacharek also gave a positive assessment of the film, calling it \\"captivating\\" in its perspective on aging and as a retrospective on Springsteen's career.

He, along with Keshavrao Jedhe, first emerged as a young leader of non-brahmin movement in Pune, and later gained state-wide reputation for his scathing critic of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Vishnushastri Chiplunkar in his book Deshache Dushman (Enemies of the Country). Started as a principled follower of Mahatma Phule, he further turned more towards communism and worked to bring communist principles together with teachings of Satyashodhak Samaj. Early Life Javaklar was born in a Maratha peasant family in 1898 at Alandi (Chorachi) near Pune. His family owned 5-6 acres of land, which they had to sell in 1926. He got married in the same year. Without any other source of steady income, his livelihood mainly depended upon writing and patronage. He completed his education till matriculation. Around this time, he came in contact with Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur who got impressed by his fierce writing and oratory and asked him to come Kolhapur. At Kolhapur, he managed a newspaper Tarun Maratha (Young Maratha). He left Kolhapur in 1921 and settled at Pune. At Pune, he started working with Keshavrao Jedhe, a prominent non-brahmin leader of his time. Background to Deshache Dushman The Pune of early 1900s was notably divided in orthodox conservatives and reformers. The reformer faction was led by various leaders of Satyashodhak Samaj, most prominently by Shahu Maharaj, while Tilak was the leader of the conservatives. The conservatives would oppose any measures of social reforms that the reformers would try to achieve. notes that many leaders of Tilak party suggested that \\"only boys should be brought under the scheme of free and compulsory education and not girls.\\": \\"In a meeting of the municipality convened on 31 July 1925, Keshavrao Jedhe moved a resolution seeking to throw open the public tanks and taps maintained at the cost of municipality to all the touchables and untouchables alike. The resolution was opposed by Brahmin members..\\" Even after the death of Tilak in 1920 and of Shahu Maharaj in 1922, the two groups often resorted to fierce criticism of each others. notes an almost vulgar nature of the abuses hurled by the two groups at each others. The conservative Tilak followers would call the reformers as येडझवे (fucktards) and the reformers would call the conservatives as षंढ (impotent). Nalawade (1989) also quotes examples like \\"अहो हे सुधारक नव्हे। पण असती येडझवे ।। यांचे कळेनात कावे । मारा यांना पैजार ।।\\", \\"आला आला छत्रपती मेळा। पळा भटांनो पळा।।\\", and \\"ज्या नराला चाड नाही। जो निर्लज्ज भाड खाई।। जो सदा द्रव्यास पाही।। तो एक षंढ जाणा।।\\" In 1924, Pune Municipality erected statues of two prominent Brahmin figures - Tilak and Chiplunkar - in the city. Against this backdrop, the non-Brahmin group proposed a statue of Mahatma Jotirao Phule to be installed at a suitable public place in the city. This proposal was vehemently opposed by the Brahmin group. B. B. Bhopatkar, a prominent Brahmin who ran a newspaper Bhala (Javelin) argued \\"what service Jotirao Phule rendered to Pune as to set up his public memorial? He was not a public figure but a sectarian.\\"Quoted in Deshache Dushman Javalkar wrote his most famous work Deshache Dushman, literally Enemies of the Country in July 1925. The book was published by Keshavrao Jedhe and printed by R. N. Lad. Introduction to the book was written by Keshavrao Bagade, a non-brahmin lawyer. The book was a blistering critic of Tilak and Chiplunkar in a tone that was intensely aggressive. Its language was fiery, sometimes even obscene.At one instance, he called Tilak mentor-in-chief of the dogs He stated that Tilak and Chiplunkar were not national heroes as they were generally considered, but indeed enemies of the country. He further stated that Brahmins desired to consolidate their power and caste superiority by dividing the masses and keeping them trapped in the fabricated ideas of superiority and inferiority by birth. He concluded the book with an appeal to all Hindus that they should free themselves from the slavery of Brahmanism and from the chains of caste system. He stated that only those Brahmins who stop considering themselves superior and unite with the masses with flesh and blood should be considered an ally. Though he heavily criticized the Brahmin caste, he also wrote favourably about some progressive Brahmin leaders of those times - Agarkar, Gokhale, Ranade - in the book itself. While the book was admired by certain non-brahmin leaders like Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, it created an instant furore among the Brahmin group. In September 1925, one Shrikrishna Madhav Chiplunkar, nephew of Vishnushastri Chiplunkar filed a suit against Javalkar, Jedhe, Lad, and Bagade for defaming his family. The case was trialed before City Magistrate who gave his verdict on 15 September 1926. Javalkar and Lad were sentenced to imprisonment for one year. Jedhe and Bagade were sentenced for six months. The court also imposed monetary fine on all four of them. All of them were sent to Yerwada Jail and remained in jail until bail was achieved after two weeks. Javalkar and others appealed in a higher court in October 1926. In the appeal, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar appeared for Javalkar and won the case resulting in acquittal of all four accused. The Deshache Dushman case was one of the first cases pleaded by Dr. Ambedkar who further went on to become an eminent jurist and first law minister of India. Because of its pugnacious language, Deshache Dushman turned out to be a very controversial book. Javalkar tried to publish its second edition; however, by that time differences grew between Jedhe and Javalkar, and the second edition could not happen. Even after his death, the book could not be republished until 1984 and its republished copies suffered mass burning in 1991. Politics The results of Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms in 1919 provided that seven seats would be reserved for non-Brahmin castes in Bombay presidency. During the same time, some non-brahmin leaders whose works were previously restricted to social activities started taking part in active politics. Javalkar extensively travelled during this period. In May 1927, he along with Jedhe, toured Central Province and Berar and gave speeches at many places. The same year, he declared his support to Mahad Satyagraha by Dr. Ambedkar and also participated in burning of Manusmriti. In 1927, British government appointed Simon Commission to consider giving more political rights to Indians. As the commission had no Indian members, the non-brahmin party, along with Indian National Congress, decided to boycott this commission. However, there was an alternate view that held leaders of depressed communities should participate in working of the Commission and press upon their issues. Dr. Ambedkar testified in front of the commission in October 1928. Javalkar decided to cooperate with the commission. This, however, created a riff between him and his long-time colleague Jedhe. In 1927, Javalkar took upon editorship of a Marathi newspaper Kaivari from Bhaskarrao Jadhav, another non-brahmin leader and a member of legislative assembly of Bombay Presidency. Jadhav was already opposed by Jedhe for participating in electoral politics. Collaboration with Jadhav created further differences between Jedhe and Javalkar. However, his work at Kaivari brought him to support red flag movement of mill workers at Mumbai. He actively supported the workers' union and came to an opinion that the workers should struggle equally against both British government and against capitalism. Javalkar visited England in 1929-30 to further his cause of non-brahmin movement. Back home in India, he was being criticized by Jedhe- led group of non-Brahmins for his alliance with Jadhav, who in turn was in collaboration with the British. His visit to England intensified his nationalist feelings and also brought him in contact with the British Communist Party. He came back to India in 1930 as a nationalist and a Marxist ready to spread socialist ideas and to form a radical anti-capitalist and nationalist peasant's movement. He also proposed that non-brahmin party to change its caste-demonstrating name and assume Shetkari Paksha (Peasant Party) as its new name. Javalkar continued with his writing after coming back from England. He wrote Krantiche Ranashing (The War-cry of Revolution), one of the earliest Marxist books in Marathi. In this book, he drew upon themes of Satyashodhak Samaj as a starting point and came to a conclusion that there would be no emancipation until religious bondage was broken. He strongly held that Indian peasants should come together under principles of socialism and form a peasant swaraj. Javalkar edited a newspaper Tej for few months in 1931. His writing turned more towards socialism and their tone turned more revolutionary. In Tej, he wrote articles some radical articles like \\"The Raising of a Peasant Army\\" and \\"Preparations for the First War of Freedom.\\" Here he took a clear position that three chief enemies of masses were capitalism, feudalism, and imperialism. In these three, he maintained that feudalism and imperialism were already on decline and capitalism was the primary enemy. Javalkar had, through his writing and speeches, had created strong connect with masses of rural Maharashtra like no other communist leaders of his time. Within the non-brahmin party, he was trying to form a group with a well-defined constitution, anti-capitalist ideology, and a new flag with a plough as its symbol. On 16 January 1931, Javalkar was arrested for giving a speech at Azad Maidan Solapur in spite of prohibitory orders by the government. He was sentenced to imprisonment for one-and-a-half year. Though, he was released in March as a result of Gandhi–Irwin Pact. Death and legacy Javalkar mostly remained sick after his return from England. Meanwhile, his tours and speeches were still ongoing. After his release from prison in March 1931, he visited Nagpur on invitation of the non-brahmin movement there. He fell sick at Nagpur. On his way back, he participated in Kalaram Temple satyagraha at Nashik under the leadership of Dr. Ambedkar. At Nashik, his health deteriorated further and he returned to Pune where he saw no improvement. He died of consumption on 3 May 1932. He was survived by his wife Indutai and son Shivajirao. Javalkar strived to create a well-organized peasant's organisation within the non-brahmin party. notes \\"though the radical peasant organisation that Javalkar projected did not come to fruition, but it's beginnings were suggestive.\\" Indeed, Peasants and Workers Party of India was formed about a decade and a half after his death by the very own non- brahmin leaders - Keshavrao Jedhe and others - that were part of Indian National Congress during his lifetime.

The club was founded in 1919 and competed in the first official season of the Slovenian football, the 1920 Ljubljana Subassociation League. It was renamed to MAK in 1921, before disbanding in 1922. History The club known as the Rote Elf already existed prior the World War I, and was one of the two major German sports clubs in the city of Maribor at the time; the other being Marburger Sportvereinigung. After the war, in 1919, the club was reestablished. It remained faithful to its pre-war principles, as the club was non-nationalistic and was based on Austro-Marxism, and is one of the first workers' clubs in the area of Slovene lands. The team was composed of both the German and Slovenian footballers. Rudolf Winkler was the team's captain and is considered as the all-time best player of the club. In 1920, Rote Elf inaugurated their renovated football pitch called Sportplatz Kreuzhofwiese, in a match against Slovan from Ljubljana. However, only less important matches were played there; the team played more important matches at the bigger Sportplatz Rapid im Volksgarten, which was owned by SV Rapid Marburg. In the inaugural season of the Ljubljana Subassociation League in 1920, Rote Elf finished in sixth place out of seven teams. As the Austro-Marxism lost its sense in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, it was getting harder and harder for the club to attract footballers from the working class. To solve this problem, the club was renamed to MAK (; ) in May 1921, however, this move did not help in achieving better recognition among the players and the citizens of Maribor. The club entered the 1922–23 Ljubljana Subassociation League, but withdrew from the competition in late 1922 and ceased all operations.

Various Indigenous controlled fire practices have been curtailed and outlawed since European colonization of the Americas, such as through the Weeks Act, which brought paradigmatic changes in ecosystem priorities and management. Land was protected from fire, and vegetation accumulated near settlements, increasing the risk of explosive, smoky conflagrations. Karuk and other aboriginal fire-keepers have passed down knowledge of vegetation clearing practices. In the last few decades, these cultural memories has been acknowledged by the United States Forest Service, NOAA, and other agencies in American colonial nations. While non-human-caused ignitions are typical of fire-prone ecosystems, higher human population and settlement extending into the wildland–urban interface has brought with it increased accidental and intentional sparking of fires.

The Oregon Department of Forestry declared fire season beginning July 5, 2020, signaling the end of unregulated debris burning outdoors, a major cause of wildfires. Between July 16 and 30, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and many county governments – including Mason, Thurston, King, Pierce and Whatcom Counties – issued fire safety burn bans due to elevated risk of uncontrolled fires. In late July, a brush fire in Chelan County, the Colockum Fire, burned at least and caused homes to be evacuated. A fire on the Colville Reservation near Nespelem called the Greenhouse Fire burned at least and caused the evacuation of the Colville Tribal Corrections Facility and other structures. Between August 14 and 16, Northern California was subjected to record-breaking warm temperatures,  due to anomalously strong high pressure over the region. Early on August 15, the National Weather Service for San Francisco issued a Fire Weather Watch highlighting the risk of wildfire starts due to the combination of lightning risk due to moist, unstable air aloft, dry fuels, and hot temperatures near the surface. Later that day, the Fire Weather Watch was upgraded to a Red Flag Warning, noting the risk of abundant lightning already apparent as the storms moved toward the region from the south. In mid-August, the remnants of Tropical Storm Fausto interacted with the jet stream, resulting in a large plume of moisture moving northward towards the West Coast of the U.S., triggering a massive siege of lightning storms in Northern California, and setting the conditions for wildfires elsewhere. * * Due to abnormal wind patterns, this plume streamed from up to off the coast of the Baja Peninsula into Northern California. This moisture then interacted with a high-pressure ridge situated over Nevada that was bringing a long-track heat wave to much of California and the West. These colliding weather systems then created excessive atmospheric instability that generated massive thunderstorms throughout much of Northern and Central California. Such thunderstorms are rare for California, but were more typical of Midwest garden-variety storms, with one location near Travis Air Force Base going from around in nearly 1–2 hours. Additionally, much of these storms were only accompanied with dry lightning and produced little to no rain, making conditions very favorable for wildfires to spark and spread rapidly. As a result of the fires, on August 19, Governors Kate Brown and Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency for Oregon and Washington respectively. = Growth of fires = Six of the twenty largest wildfires in California history were part of the 2020 wildfire season. Five of the new wildfires ranking in the top 10 were all a part of the August 2020 lightning fires. By August 20, the Palmer Fire near Oroville, Washington – which started August 18 – had reached and forced evacuation of up to 85 homes. The largest of the fires in the Olympics reached by August 20. View of the Bobcat Fire from a kitchen window in Monrovia, California The Evans Canyon Fire, a few miles north of Naches, began around August 31 and expanded to tens of thousands of acres, shut down Washington State Route 821 in the Yakima River Canyon, burned several homes and caused hundreds of families to evacuate, and caused unhealthy air quality in Yakima County. By September 6, it had burned almost . The August 2020 lightning fires include three of the largest wildfires in the recorded history of California: the SCU Lightning Complex, the August Complex, and the LNU Lightning Complex. On September 10, 2020, the August Complex became the single-largest wildfire in the recorded history of California, reaching a total area burned of . Then, on September 11, it merged with the Elkhorn Fire, another massive wildfire of , turning the August Complex into a monster wildfire of . In early September 2020, a combination of a record-breaking heat wave, and Diablo and Santa Ana winds sparked more fires and explosively grew active fires, with the August Complex surpassing the 2018 Mendocino Complex to become California's largest recorded wildfire. The North Complex increased in size as the winds fanned it westward, threatening the city of Oroville, and triggering mass evacuations. During the first week in September, the 2020 fire season set a new California record for the most area burned in a year at . As of September 13, had burned in the state. On September 5, heat from the Creek Fire generated a large pyrocumulonimbus cloud, described as one of the largest seen in the United States. Carbon monoxide hotspots show locations of the wildfires On September 7, a \\"historic fire event\\" with high winds resulted in 80 fires and nearly burned in a day. Malden, in the Palouse Country of Eastern Washington, was mostly destroyed by one of the fires. By the evening of September 8, the Cold Springs Canyon and adjacent Pearl Hill Fires had burned over and neither was more than 10% contained. Smoke blanketed the Seattle area on September 8 and caused unhealthy air conditions throughout the Puget Sound region, and affected Southwest British Columbia. The cities of Phoenix and Talent in Oregon were substantially destroyed by the Almeda Drive Fire. State-wide, at least 23 people have been killed. On September 11, authorities said they were preparing for a mass fatality incident. As of September 11, 600 homes and 100 commercial buildings have been destroyed by the Almeda Drive Fire.Benda, David. \\"Southern Oregon wildfires update: 700-plus homes, businesses destroyed as officials' investigate fire's cause \\", Redding Record Searchlight. September 11, 2020. Retrieved September 11, 2020. Officials stated that the Almeda Drive Fire was human-caused. On September 11, a man was arrested for arson, for allegedly starting a fire that destroyed multiple homes in Phoenix and merged with the Almeda Drive Fire.Deliso, Merideth. \\"Man charged with arson in connection with Almeda Fire in southern Oregon \\", ABC News. September 11, 2020. Retrieved September 12, 2020. A separate criminal investigation into the origin point of the Almeda Drive Fire in Ashland is ongoing. Around September 11–12, wildfires were starting to encroach upon the Clackamas County suburbs of Portland, Oregon, especially the fast-moving Riverside Fire which had already jumped the nearby community of Estacada, but shifting wind directions kept the fire away from the main Portland area. Through much of September, at least 8 large wildfires, each of or more, were burning in Washington and Oregon, with 3 in Washington and 5 in Oregon. This was unprecedented for those two states, which combined only saw a total of 26 large fires from 1997 to 2019. On September 22, 10 large fires, each of at least 100,000 acres, were burning across California, including 5 of the 10 largest wildfires in the state's history. = Evacuations = The Government of California's video about COVID-19 protocols in place at wildfire evacuation centers The first evacuations began on September 4, when almost 200 people were airlifted out of the Sierra National Forest due to the rapidly exploding Creek Fire. Then on September 9, most of the southern area of the city of Medford, Oregon was forced to evacuate and almost all of the 80,000 residents living in the city were told to be ready if necessary because of the uncontained Almeda Drive Fire, which was fast encroaching on their city. As of September 11, about 40,000 people in Oregon had been instructed to evacuate, and 500,000, accounting for about 10% of the state's population, had received instructions to prepare for evacuation, being under a Level 1, 2, or 3 fire evacuation alert.

Wildfires have been aggressively suppressed in recent years, resulting in a buildup of fuel, increasing the risk of large uncontrollable fires. There is broad scientific consensus that there should be more controlled burning of forest in California in order to reduce fire risk. Controlled burning is hampered by wildfire litigation models that present wildfires in court cases as the result of careless ignition events while discounting underlying forest conditions. A 2020 ProPublica investigation blamed the culture of Cal Fire, greed on the part of fire suppression contractors, and risk aversion on the part of the U.S. Forest Service from preventing appropriate controlled burns from taking place. = Climate change = Secretary of California's Natural Resources Agency Wade Crowfoot urges President Trump to not ignore the science on climate change to which Trump responds \\"I don't think science knows, actually\\" and \\"It'll start getting cooler. You just watch.\\" Climate change has led to increased heat waves and the risk of drought in California, creating the conditions for more frequent and severe wildfires. It has been observed that since the early 1970s, warm‐season days in California warmed by ca. 1.4 °C. This significantly increases the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, the difference between the actual and a maximum moisture content for a certain temperature. These trends are consistent with human-induced trends that were simulated by climate models. Summer forest‐fire area reacts to the vapor pressure deficit exponentially, i.e., warming has grown increasingly impactful. David Romps, director of the Berkeley Atmospheric Sciences Center summarizes the situation as follows: \\"To cut to the chase: Were the heat wave and the lightning strikes and the dryness of the vegetation affected by global warming? Absolutely yes. Were they made significantly hotter, more numerous, and drier because of global warming? Yes, likely yes, and yes.\\" Similarly, Friederike Otto, acting director of the University of Oxford Environmental Change Institute states, \\"There is absolutely no doubt that the extremely high temperatures are higher than they would have been without human-induced climate change. A huge body of attribution literature demonstrates now that climate change is an absolute game-changer when it comes to heat waves, and California won't be the exception.\\" Susan Clark, director of the Sustainability Initiative at the University at Buffalo, states, \\"This is climate change. This increased intensity and frequency of temperatures and heat waves are part of the projections for the future. [...] There is going to be more morbidity and mortality [from heat.] There are going to be more extremes.\\"  Obstacles to fire control  = Rumors about political extremist involvement = In Oregon, false rumors spread that antifa activists allegedly involved in arson and rioting accompanying the nearby George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon, were deliberately setting fires and were preparing to loot property that was being evacuated. Some residents refused to evacuate based on the rumors. Authorities urged residents to ignore the rumors and follow evacuation orders, noting that firefighters' lives could be endangered rescuing those who remained. QAnon followers participated in spreading the rumors, with one claim that six antifa activists had been arrested for setting fires specifically amplified by \\"Q\\", the anonymous person or people behind QAnon. Days earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr had amplified social media rumors of preceding months that planes and buses full of antifa activists were preparing to invade communities. Rumors also circulated that members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys had started some of the fires. However, authorities labelled the claims as false, saying that people needed to question claims they found on social media. There have been a number of arrests for arson surrounding the wildfires, but there is no indication that the incidents were connected to a mass arson campaign, according to multiple law enforcement officers. For example, a man allegedly set fires in Glide, Oregon, after a Douglas Forest Protection Association member refused to give him a ride to town. = COVID-19 pandemic = The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges for firefighters fighting wildfires due to measures intended to reduce the transmission of the disease. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL Fire) implemented new protocols such as wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing while resting, and reducing the number of occupants in the pickup trucks used to transport firefighters. California relies heavily on inmate firefighters, with incarcerated people making up nearly a quarter of CAL FIRE's total workforce in 2018–2019. Coronavirus measures within the prison system, such as early release and quarantine policies, have reduced the number of inmate firefighters available, necessitating the hiring of additional seasonal firefighters.  Impacts  = Fire = In Oregon, wildfires throughout the whole year, with most occurring in September, charred a record of , destroying a total of 4,800 structures, including 1,145 homes, and killing 9 people. In Washington, 2020 wildfires burned , with 418 structures, including 195 homes, burned. In California, about burned from wildfires in 2020, the highest burned acreage ever recorded in a fire season. About burned in the August lighting wildfires and more in September. 4,200 structures were destroyed the whole year in California, and 25 people were killed. = Smoke and air pollution = The fires resulted in worsened air pollution across much of the western U.S. and Canada, from Los Angeles to British Columbia. Alaska Airlines suspended its flights from Portland, Oregon, and Spokane, Washington, due to poor air quality. Some cities in Oregon recorded air quality readings of over 500 on the AQI scale, while readings of over 200 were recorded in major cities. Smoke from the fires were carried to the East Coast and Europe, causing yellowed skies but having little impact on air quality. The heavy smoke had resulted in several smoke-related incidents. In California, for example, a San Francisco resident was hiking through Yosemite National Park on September 5 when suddenly the sky turned a dark, ugly color and the temperature dropped greatly, reminiscent of a thunderstorm. Ash and smoke started falling, and this erratic weather was caused by the nearby Creek Fire. In another incident, on September 14, an Oakland A's player was at a game at the Seattle Mariners' stadium, when suddenly in the middle of the game he started gasping for air. It is estimated that as many as 1,200 to 3,000 indirect deaths have been caused by the adverse effects of smoke inhalation. Red skies have appeared over many cities over the West Coast, due to smoke from the wildfires blocking lighter colors, created from light infraction. = Ecological effects = The unique sagebrush scrub habitat of the Columbia Basin in Washington was heavily affected by the fires, devastating populations of the endemic Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit and endangered, isolated populations of greater sage-grouse and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse. About half of the pygmy rabbit population and over 30-70% of the grouse population may have been lost to the fires, reversing decades of conservation work. Aside from climate change, the spread of the fires may have been assisted by the intrusion of invasive cheatgrass into the habitats. Fires in old-growth forests of Oregon may negatively affect the populations of the endangered northern spotted owl and pine marten, and the resulting ash from the fires may be washed into streams and threaten endangered salmon. Climate change also reduces the likelihood of forests re-establishing themselves after a fire.

Life  Born in Bonn, Ley attended the Königliches Gymnasium in Bonn (today the and studied Classical philology, German studies and history at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universität Bonn. Afterwards he worked as a grammar school teacher in Emmerich and Essen and finally became headmaster of the Städtisches Gymnasium in Boppard, current ).There, he aroused the displeasure of the French occupying forces and was expelled. He then returned to teaching and taught at grammar schools in Wipperfürth, (Oberbergischer Kreis) and Linz am Rhein. After his retirement in 1932, he returned to his home town. Ley published six highly acclaimed books and a total of 85 essays on Ludwig van Beethoven. For his great services to Beethoven research he was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz first class by the then Federal President Theodor Heuss in 1958. Ley's most important legacy is an extensive collection of the surviving pictorial evidence. Today this estate is located at the Beethoven House in Bonn.

His work was primarily focused on bodegóns and paintings from the first half of the 17th century, especially by Juan van der Hamen. He organized exhibitions and catalogs at various museums and art institutes worldwide. His research and books expanded upon the knowledge of works and lives of many artists. He worked as an art expert and helped in acquisition of various paintings. Jordan became the founding director of the Meadows Museum at Southern Methodist University the year he completed his doctorate, and is credited for turning its collection into the most prominent collection of Spanish art outside Spain. He later became the chair of fine arts at the Meadows School of the Arts, and then the deputy director of the Kimbell Art Museum. He was on the board of various art institutes and museums, as well as an honorary trustee of the Prado Museum. He also maintained a private collection with his husband, from which they donated a number of works to various institutes. Early life Jordan became interested in art while working at the McNay Art Museum during summers. William B. Jordan was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1940. He had two sisters, Sue Rodarte and Frances Jordan Hearn-Rigney. He spent his childhood in San Antonio, Texas, and attended Alamo Heights High School. During summers he would work at the McNay Art Museum, where his mentor was its first director John Palmer Leeper; his work at this institute made him interested in art. He completed his bachelor's degree from the Washington & Lee University. He received his master's and doctorate in the history of Spanish art from the New York University Institute of Fine Arts, in 1964 and 1967 respectively. His collaborations with his teacher got him interested in Spanish art history and he started researching Juan van der Hamen from early 1960s. In his two-volume dissertation Juan van der Hamen y León, a Madrillenian Still-Life Painter from 1967, he presented an early monograph on the painter. In this publication, he expanded upon the knowledge of van der Hamen of the time and described his \\"three-stage composition type\\" for the first time. For his thesis he evaluated archival sources, which enabled him to write the first comprehensive biography of van der Hamen. Later, Jordan made several stays in Spain to publish another and more extensive monograph on van der Hamen. However, this project was not completed. He curated several exhibitions about van der Hamen and was able to update the knowledge of van der Hamen in the associated publications instead. Career =Meadows Museum and Southern Methodist University: 1967–1981= When Meadows Museum opened at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, it was struggling with an art scandal that had damaged its reputation; forty-four paintings in the museum had turned out to be forged, including a dozen forgeries by Elmyr de Hory. In 1966, while still a doctorate student, Jordan was offered the position of its director. He visited the place with López-Rey and assessed that a lot of old paintings in the collection were falsely attributed. He commented that their collection \\"was not very good\\" and that he would have to \\"essentially build from scratch\\". He agreed to take the job if Algur H. Meadows would agree to make changes to their collection; Meadows put aside a million U.S. dollars for his suggested changes, and he took the job. In 1967, he became the founding director and chairman of the division of fine arts of the Meadows Museum. He was appointed for the position with no prior work experience and in the year he had completed his doctorate. The museum closed down for a few months, and he started evaluating their collection with help from López-Rey and Diego Angulo Íñiguez. He started auctioning away paintings he deemed insignificant for a museum collection and put others in reserve for study purposes; thirty-five of them were auctioned, which garnered only US$35,000. He then revamped their collection by buying a new set of paintings before the museum reopened. His collection included works from Francisco Goya, Francisco de Zurbarán, and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Jordan split his time teaching and collecting. He taught courses on history of Spanish art and \\"Museums and Collecting\\" at the Southern Methodist University. While they would initially purchase paintings together, Meadows eventually trusted Jordan and would acquire paintings without seeing them if they were vetted by him. In 1976, he was given additional posts of the adjunct curator of European art at the Dallas Museum of Art and the chair of fine arts at the Meadows School of the Arts. Throughout his term, he acquired a number of prominent works form auctions and art dealers with financial support of Meadows, and significantly expanded their collection. He acquired around 75 works during his tenure, which included important paintings by Murillo, Diego Velázquez, Jusepe de Ribera, and de Zurbarán. His collection also included six significant works of Goya from the 18th and 19th century, and notable 20th century paintings by Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Juan Gris. He also helped develop the museum's \\"modern sculpture collection\\", with works from Auguste Rodin, Alberto Giacometti, Henry Moore, and Aristide Maillol. Jordan is credited for turning the Meadows Museum's collection into the most prominent collection of Spanish art outside Spain. =Kimbell Art Museum: 1981–1990= Portrait of a Man (presumed self-portrait of El Greco; 1595–1600); Jordan helped organize the \\"historic\\" 1982 exhibition, \\"El Greco of Toledo\\". Jordan left the Meadows Museum to serve as the deputy director, chairman of the scholars committee and chief curator of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth in 1981. He joined after his former colleague and director of the museum, Ted Pillsbury offered him the position. Pillsbury and Jordan worked together to acquire paintings and created an exhibitions program at the museum. As the chairman of the scholars committee, he helped organize the \\"El Greco of Toledo\\" exhibition in 1982. The exhibition was being planned since 1978 to commemorate passing of the 400th anniversary of the painter's move to Toledo, Spain. The exhibition was called \\"historic\\" and had the most extensive collection of painting done by El Greco; it included 66 paintings, 32 of which were from Spain and the rest from museums across the US. The exhibition was shown at the National Gallery of Art, Toledo Museum of Art, Dallas Museum of Art, and Prado Museum. John Russell for The New York Times commenting on the catalogue said that \\"the exhibition fulfils, in fact, a dream that has haunted the human imagination for more than 100 years.\\" In 1985, he curated the \\"Spanish Style Life in the Golden Age 1600–1650\\" exhibition at the museum. It focused on works of de Zurbarán, Juan Sánchez Cotán, and van der Hamen. He wrote labels for the paintings at the museum and descriptions for works in In Pursuit of Quality, a 1987 book by the museum. Jordan was provided with a bigger budget at the museum, which he used for exhibitions and acquiring prominent paintings such as Portrait of Don Pedro de Barberana y Aparregui (1631–1633) by Velázquez and Four Figures on a Step (1655–1660) by Murillo. He is credited for making its collection \\"considerably more meaningful to the public\\". =Retirement and independent work: 1990–2018= Jordan left the Kimbell Art Museum and retired at age 50 in 1990—following his father's footsteps, who had retired at 49. He worked as an independent art consultant and became a board member of institutes such as The Foundation for the Arts, Dallas Museum of Art, and Meadows School of the Arts. His advice on acquisitions and exhibitions was sought by different institutes, including the ones he was affiliated with in the past; he continued to work with them at his discretion. He also published books and helped organize exhibitions worldwide. He was involved in organizing the catalog for \\"Spanish Still Life from Velázquez to Goya\\" at the National Gallery, London, in 1995. It was published the same year as an eponymous book. In 1997, he published An Eye on Nature: Spanish Still-Life Paintings from Sánchez Cotán to Goya, a book analyzing still life paintings and artists. He was appointed as an honorary trustee of the Prado Museum in 2016. In 2001, he joined the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas as a member of the board of directors and played an active role in various projects. He would then serve as the trustee of the center and the Nasher Foundation. In 2005 and 2006, Jordan curated the \\"Juan Van Der Hamen Y León and the Court of Madrid\\", the first monographic exhibition on the artist; it was on view in Madrid and Dallas. He showed van der Hamen's work as a history painter and portraitist on an equal footing with his bodegóns, and discussed some of works that he attributed to van der Hamen. In 2005, he published an eponymous catalog on the occasion of this exhibition, focusing on new assessments and research on artist of the 1620s. In 2010, he headed the search committee to find a new director of the Chinati Foundation—where he was a member of the board of directors and past president—which led to the appointment of Thomas Kellein. He worked with Olivier Meslay to create an exhibition and catalog of modern European paintings that were in private collections locally at the Dallas Museum of Art in 2013. They published their work in Mind's Eye: Masterworks on Paper from David to Cézanne the next year. In 2016, he was appointed as an honorary trustee of the Prado Museum. He died on January 22, 2018, at the William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital, Dallas from complications of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Art acquisitions San Sebastián (1506) by Yáñez, one of his prominent acquisitions. Jordan was frequently called upon as an art expert; he made a name for being able to tell reproduced copies from authentic paintings. Sam Holland, the dean of the Meadows School of the Arts commented on Jordan's abilities: \\"He had a brilliant gift for art. There's something that's hard to quantify that sets somebody apart from the rest of us — his ability to spot authenticity on the highest level of the art world.\\" He was considered to have an \\"eye\\" for significant paintings that were unattributed at the time and acquiring them at auctions for relatively little money. In 1976, Jordan noticed San Sebastián (1506) by Fernando Yáñez de la Almedina in Manuel González's gallery in Madrid. The painting was not attributed to Yáñez at that time and there were no records in Spanish sources to prove that. However, Jordan was confident, and he made the purchase with Meadows' support. Research confirmed that the painting was indeed a work by Yáñez, and it was \\"universally regarded as one of the artist's masterpieces\\" and became one of the more important works in the Meadows collection. He helped acquire Fox in the Snow (1860) by Gustave Courbet in 1979 for the Dallas Museum of Art, an acquisition of a painting that was outside his area of expertise. In 1990, he was called as an expert by the San Diego Museum of Art during acquisition of The Adoration of the Shepherds (1572–74) by El Greco and St. Sebastian (1604) by Juan Sánchez Cotán. He had noticed St. Sebastian at an auction in New York, where it was bought by a local dealer. The painting was vaguely attributed to a \\"Flemish master\\" during the auction, but he recognized that it was a work by Cotán. The museum purchased the work after the painting was vetted and its attribution confirmed by Jordan. =Private collection and philanthropy= Jordan maintained a collection of art with his husband Robert Dean Brownlee at their residency in Turtle Creek, Dallas; it included works of artists like Eugène Delacroix and Paul Cézanne. His most notable acquisition was of Portrait of Philip III (1623–1631) by Diego Velázquez in 1988. He found the piece at a London auction, where it was attributed to Justus Sustermans. He suspected it to be a work by Velázquez and acquired the painting after a bid of £1,000. He had it restored at the Kimbell Art Museum by Claire Barry, and kept the painting in his private collection for almost 30 years. In 2016, the Prado Museum vetted and confirmed that the painting was indeed a work by Velázquez. The painting was subsequently valued at around US$6 million. Later that year, he donated it to a non-profit organization called American Friends of Prado Museum, which then gave the painting to the museum as a long-term deposit. The Dallas Museum of Art established a Works on Paper Department with contributions from the William B. Jordan and Robert Dean Brownlee Endowment in 2019. Jordan and Brownlee also donated over 80 different art works to the museum; fifty-eight of them were works on paper. Their donation also included oil paintings and furniture from the 19th and 20th century respectively, and other antiquities such as silver works, ceramics, and sculptures. They had also acquired a number of sculptures for their private collection. In 2020, Brownlee donated works by John Chamberlain, David McManaway, Joan Miró, and Claes Oldenburg to the Nasher Sculpture Center on behalf of him. A Baby Rolling Over by Agustí Querol Subirats was donated to the Meadows Museum by art historian Michael P. Mezzatesta in honor of William B. Jordan in 2020; Jordan had previously donated a sculpture of Saint John the Baptist by Luisa Roldán, which was similar in style, to the museum in 1999.

One of the most widely used forms of community-engaged research is community-based participatory research (CBPR), though it also encompasses action research and participatory action research.  History  Community-engaged research arose in response to historical abuse of marginalized people by researchers, who failed to consider the needs of the community and potential benefits of the research. Types of CEnR include action research, community-based participatory research (CBPR), and participatory action research (PAR). The field of CEnR has grown rapidly since 2005.  Process  Community-engaged research is planned in partnership with the community that is the intended target of the research. It requires the development of partnerships between researchers and the community, cooperation and negotiation between parties, collaboration, and a commitment to addressing local health concerns. This can create additional steps not traditionally found in research projects, such as jointly creating a mission statement or a memorandum of understanding to establish terminology, timelines, and expectations. These planning steps typically occur before funding is secured for the research project. Community members may be skeptical of research conducted without compensation; researchers and the community can collaborate to define fair compensation for participation. CEnR projects exist along a spectrum of the level of community involvement. In order from least- to most-involved, examples are investigator-driven research, community-placed research, community-based research, community-based participatory research, and community-driven research.  Scope  Reviews of community-engaged research indicate that this type of research predominantly occurs in the US and the Americas. Europe is represented chiefly by studies in the United Kingdom, and some studies have been conducted in Australia as well. Few reviews of community-engaged research have included work done in Africa or Asia.

Feldman (1925–2017) was a modernist American painter, printmaker and mosaicist who spent most of his life and career in Providence, Rhode Island. He is best known for his expressionist paintings, woodcuts, and public commission mosaics and stain glass windows. He became a student at the Yale School of Art in 1942.. After graduating from the Yale University of Fine Arts (BFA 1950) and Yale University School of Design (MFA 1951), he became an art educator at Brown University for over 5 decades. In 1990, Feldman founded and was the principal designer of art books of Ziggurat Press in Providence. Early life Walter Feldman was born in 1925 in Lynn Massachusetts. His parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe and Feldman grew up in Chelsea “... a Russian-Polish-Jewish community surrounded by Irish”.Walter Feldman: Notes on His Life and Work by James Schevill, p.13. Walter Feldman, Bell Gallery, List Art Building, Brown University exhibition catalogue, 1978. While Feldman’s parents hoped he would enter one of the practical professions like law, they appeased his interest in art as a youngster by allowing him to take art classes on Saturday afternoon at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. .Walter Feldman: Notes on His Life and Work by James Schevill, p.13. Walter Feldman, Bell Gallery, List Art Building, Brown University exhibition catalogue, 1978. After high school, Feldman was admitted as a student at the Yale School of the Fine Arts in 1942. World War II service From 1943 through 1946, Feldman served in the 330th Infantry Regiment of the 83rd Infantry Division, a unit that saw significant combat in the European theatre. During his tour of duty Feldman was awarded 4 battle stars, the Purple Heart and the combat infantry badge and reached the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. His service included action in the Allied Forces defense of the Ardennes forest during the German counter- offensive action known as the Battle of the Bulge. On January 6th, 1945, while under heavy mortar and artillery fire, Feldman sustained shrapnel wounds to his lower back and lay strapped on the top of an Army jeep for five hours awaiting evacuation and treatment. His near death and harrowing rescue experiences left impressions that would manifest in the artist’s work over the decades, as well as leaving him with a life-long injury. Told he would likely never walk again while recuperating, he overcame the pain and injury turning to painting as a form of healing. “Through the pain I learned how to paint too. Pain and painting, I learned the strange verbal connection”Walter Feldman: Notes on His Life and Work by James Schevill, p.14. Walter Feldman, Bell Gallery, List Art Building, Brown University exhibition catalogue, 1978. World War II themes played a prominent role in Feldman’s art throughout the decades. A study titled The Soldier is an early example of Feldman’s sobering war experience. It is a macabre image of a skeleton-faced soldier, completed in 1946 when he returned from service. “I had many moving experiences during the war. One of them happened at a time when we were having two meals a day during combat. We were in line getting food, and we were pleased because we had cold rations for weeks. After I got my food, I started to walk down the steps of a nearby quarry to find a place to sit, and there was a dead German soldier with just his toes sticking out of his boot. Dead and cold. That was the memory I had when I did this painting tempura on cardboard”.Points in Time: Walter Feldman Selected Works. The artist talks about his work. An edited interview conducted by Kathryn de Boer in April 2010 in the artist’s studio in Providence. Published by Ziggurat Press, Providence, RI, August 2010. Feldman dealt with the pain of war regularly in his art over the course of his career. Ardennes Skirmish a dark, brooding abstract painting he created in 1958 is another example that Feldman never ceased painting the haunting aftermath of his war experiences. During an oral interview in 1998 with Robert Brown from the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art, Feldman explained \\"You never forget it, and unfortunately it's true. I sit here and tell you that it happened more than fifty-- fifty years ago! And I remember every nuance, every smell, everything about it. It's unbelievable that you can have such a memory\\".Oral history interview with Walter Feldman, August 10, 1998, Smithsonian Archives of American Art. Art education Feldman re-enrolled at Yale in the Fall of 1946, he completed his BFA in 1950. he was awarded the Alice Kimball English Traveling Fellowship and spent a few months after graduation traveling in France and Italy and furthering his exposure to past masters and modern European artists. He returned to Yale as a graduate student, where his teachers included Willem de Kooning and Josef Albers, and received an MFA in 1951. As an undergraduate art student (1946-1950), Feldman worked on mastering technical painting skills in a realism style. The work, The Mother, is a “memory portrait” from this period. Points in Time: Walter Feldman Selected Works. The artist talks about his work. An edited interview conducted by Kathryn de Boer in April 2010 in the artist’s studio in Providence. Published by Ziggurat Press, Providence, RI, August 2010. Feldman joined the Yale faculty as an Instructor of Painting for the next two years. In 1953 he was appointed to the Brown University art department where he stayed until his retirement in 2007. 1950s-1960s Feldman achieved his first major professional critical success when he received the print prize at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s American Watercolors, Drawings and Prints exhibition in 1952 for his woodcut The Final Agony.Falk, Peter Hastings, ed., Who Was Who in American Art, 1564-1975, Vol. I, Sound View Press, 1999, p. The print is now in the collection of Yale University, which also acquired the carved wood block. The year 1953 marked the artist’s first solo exhibition at the Artists’ Gallery on Lexington Avenue in New York City, and the inclusion of his paintings in a group show at New York’s Kraushaar Galleries. The exhibited works demonstrated Feldman’s stylist drift towards abstraction. Art Critic Dore Aston of Art Digest reviewed Feldman’s 1953 exhibit and wrote “In his first one-man show, this young painter hovers between French cubism and German expressionist, using the flat decorative shapes of the former and the vigorous distorted figures of the latter. The two languages are agreeably synthesized in smaller still-lifes”.Aston, Dore, Review of Kraushaar Galleries Exhibition, Art Digest, September 1953. Critic Howard Devree of The New York Times wrote “the paintings exemplify the main concern of many modern painters—the reconciliation of subject matter with idiosyncratic and abstract painting language”. He concluded the show was “a remarkably mature first one- man exhibition of paintings…”.“Group Exhibitions Top Week in Art: Review of show at Artists’ Gallery”, The New York Times, Sept. 26, 1953. In 1957, Feldman received a Senior Fulbright Fellowship working in Rome with painting and studying mosaics as an apprentice to an Italian master.Prof. Walter S. Feldman Wins Fulbright Award, The Chelsea Record, June 4, 1956. During the year, Feldman also traveled to Spain, the Middle East, Turkey, and Israel to study various mosaic styles. Feldman’s self-portrait was awarded the gold medal at the Mostra Internazionale in Milan, followed by a solo exhibition at Milan’s Grattacielo Gallery.Walter Feldman Wins Top Prize in Italy, The Chelsea Record, May 1, 1957. His knowledge of mosaics permeated much of his future art: many of his new paintings incorporated an impasto paint technique that gave the canvas a mosaic texture. Sicilian Cathedral is a work that demonstrates Feldman’s use of small shapes with their own secondary directions to control a large area, similar to tesserae in a mosaic. That same year he completed two major commissions: a multicolor woodcut for the International Graphic Arts Society and a series of exterior mosaic pavements for the Temple Beth-El in Providence.Providence Practitioner of Ancient Art: The Beth El Mosaics, The Rhode Islander, Providence Journal Magazine, April 25, 1954. Feldman 's work was the subject of multiple solo exhibitions at Kraushaar Galleries in New York, as well the Decordova Museum in Massachusetts, the Providence Art Club, the Obelisk Gallery, Pace Gallery, and Kanegis Gallery in Boston, the Mexican- American Institute in Mexico City and the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. His themes included subject matter like death, war and spiritual redemption and atonement. He continuously sifted and incorporated his translations of these themes onto his canvases with serious and provocative imagery. Lot's Wife, The Final Agony, Job and The Sacrifice of Isaac are some of Feldman's biblically themed works from the 1950s. But like many modernists of his day, Feldman sought a new expressive vocabulary for these themes on his canvases. Poet James Schevill wrote of Feldman in a 1978 essay, “During the 1950s, although his work grew much freer, he hovered between the influence of the Abstract-Expressionists and his instinctive desire, from his Jewish, humanistic background, for symbolic subject matter”.Walter Feldman: Notes on His Life and Work by James Schevill, p.16. Walter Feldman, Bell Gallery, List Art Building, Brown University exhibition catalogue, 1978. Feldman executed a large exterior mosaic mural for Temple Emanu-El in Providence, and that was followed by a commission to create seven stained glass windows for the Sugarman Memorial Chapel in Providence (1961). He was awarded the George A. and Eliza Gardener Howard Fellowship and spent 1962 painting in Mexico where he absorbed a great deal of the pre-Columbian imagery and culture. In 1968, Feldman designed and painted a 32-panel mural for the new meeting hall of Temple Emanu-el in Providence. Later years Feldman was promoted to Professor of Art at Brown University in 1961 while continuing to create and exhibit his art in multiple media—painting, printmaking, sculpture and mosaics. From 1985 on, he divided his time between painting and as a designer and publisher of artists' books under the Ziggurat press imprint. Feldman was the founder of the Ziggurat Press in Providence. His works are in over 100 public collections including the Holocaust Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, Archives of American Art in Washington, DC, Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum , the Yale University Art Gallery , and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. Feldman retired from teaching at Brown University in 2007, but he kept creating art and publishing prints and books up until his death in Providence in 2017. In 2013, he endowed the Walter Feldman Fellowship for Emerging Artists at the Arts & Business Council of Greater Boston. The Fellowship supports the professional career of a visual artist through providing a solo exhibition with curatorial and professional development guidance for their career. Upon his death he also created the Walter S. Feldman Trust for Artwork at Brown University to maintain his works and provide funds for the institution.

In 1973 he broke off his studies and started manifesting himself as a designer and printer of activist printed matter. In the 1980s he developed into a publisher (Gerards & Schreurs, Huis Clos Publishers) and as a designer of literary books, by authors such as Louis Paul Boon, Gerard Reve, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vladislav Khodasevich, Anatol Stern and Daniil Kharms. One of the characteristics of his book designs is the varied use of typefaces. Besides the use of classic typefaces like Bembo, Baskerville, Futura, Gill Sans and Neue Helvetica, Gerards turned out to be an advocate of the new Dutch digital typefaces such as Trinité (Bram de Does), Scala (Martin Majoor), Quadraat (Fred Smeijers), Caecilia (Peter Matthias Noordzij) and Offline (Roelof Mulder). de Jong, Ralf (2015) Boeken van nu, terug naar de toekomst.

Three years later he settled in Amsterdam under the name ‘Piet Gerards Ontwerpers’. In his studio he organised a series of meetings under the name ‘25 chairs’: Marita Mathijsen, Jan van Adrichem, Henk Hoeks, Bart Sorgedrager and Saskia Asser were some of the sixteen speakers who discussed their favourite ten books with the attendees. He gave lectures about his work in Vienna, Raabs, Essen and Heerlen. In the academic year 2010-2011 he taught book typography at the Plantin Institute for Typography in Antwerp. Before he decided to stop in 2018, he made exhibitions in the Province Hall Limburg (‘Complot rond een vierkant. De goodwill-reeks van drukkerij Rosbeek’), for Special Collections of the Amsterdam University Library (‘Afsetters en meester-afsetters. De kunst van het kleuren’) and for the Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam. (‘25 years Huis Clos Publisher’). Now, living in Arnhem, The Netherlands, he occasionally designs under his own name.

Born in Dighton, Massachusetts, Talbot worked for the American Tract Society and other evangelical Christian organizations in New York City before becoming a professional artist, first exhibiting in the National Academy of Design in 1838. His work was often favorably compared to that of Thomas Cole and other leaders of the Hudson River School of American landscape painters. Talbot developed a friendship with Walt Whitman in the 1850s. The notebook in which Whitman first wrote down the ideas for Leaves of Grass is known as the “Talbot Wilson notebook” because Talbot’s name and address (Wilson Street in Brooklyn, New York) are written on the inside front cover. Talbot died in relative obscurity in 1879.  Biography  = Early life and career = Jesse Talbot was born April 1, 1805, in Dighton, Massachusetts, the youngest child of Josiah Talbot and Lydia Talbot (née Wheaton).Vital records of Dighton and Rehoboth, Massachusetts, accessed through ancestry.com. Around the age of 15, he moved to Dedham, Massachusetts, to work in the pharmacy of his mother’s youngest sibling, Dr. Jesse Wheaton (1762/3 – November 5, 1847).D. Hamilton Hurd, ed., History of Bristol County, Massachusetts, with Biographical Sketches of Many of Its Pioneers and Prominent Men (Philadelphia: J. W. Lewis & Co., 1883), 250. US Census records from 1820 show a “free white male” between the ages of sixteen and twenty-six residing in Wheaton’s home, probably Talbot, although he would have been only fifteen in 1820. By 1829, Talbot had moved to New York City, where he was employed by the American Tract Society at its headquarters on Nassau Street in Manhattan, then the center of the New York publishing world.The Fourth Annual Report of the American Tract Society (New York: Printed for the Society by D. Fanshaw, 1829) lists Talbot as the “Assistant” for the Executive Committee and as one of many “directors” on the masthead. It also lists him as a member of the Shipping and Steam-Boat Committee, the City Committee, and the Division of Labor, with responsibility (with four others) for the fourth district, from Burling Slip to India Wharf. He began by distributing tracts along the city’s wharves, but by 1834 he had been promoted to “Assistant Secretary.”Ninth Annual Report of the American Tract Society (New York: Printed at the Society’s House by D. Fanshawe, 1834), 23; Religious Intelligencer (May 1834), 807. He served as “Recording Secretary” of the New- York Tract Society, an affiliate of the national organization.Ninth Annual Report of the New-York Tract Society (New York: New-York Tract Society, 1836), 3. He also became involved with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.In 1836 and 1837, Talbot appears on the rolls of the “Receiving Agents of the Board” for the organization. New York as It Is, 6th edition (New York: T. R. Tanner, 1840), 78–79. Through that organization, he came into contact with the Reverend Richard Sluyter of Claverack, New York, whose daughter Mary Augusta he married in the Dutch Reformed church in that town in 1836.Sluyter is listed as a member of the organization’s board in 1835: Report of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Read at the Twenty-Sixth Annual Meeting (Boston: Printed for the Board by Crocker & Brewster, 1835), 14. Richard Wynkoop, Schuremans, of New Jersey (New York: Knickerbocker Press, 1902), 95; Christian Intelligencer of the Dutch Reformed Church, October 29, 1836. = Artistic career = After Jesse Talbot, Rockland Lake, in The Token and Atlantic Souvenir: An Offering for Christmas and the New Year (Boston: David H. Williams, 1842). Talbot’s artistic career began at the 1838 annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in New York, in which he exhibited two portraits and a landscape (all unlocated).Mary Bartlett Cowdrey, National Academy of Design Exhibition Record, 1826–1860, vol. 2 (New York: New-York Historical Society, 1943), 150. All subsequent indications of when a work was shown at the National Academy are from this source; the source for American Art-Union exhibition records is also Cowdrey, American Academy of Fine Arts and American Art-Union Exhibition Record 1816–1852 (New York: New- York Historical Society, 1843). His earliest known extant work is a portrait frontispiece for a biography printed by the American Tract Society in 1840.Rev. Miron Winslow, Memoir of Mrs. Harriet Winslow, Thirteen Years a Member of the American Mission in Ceylon (New York: American Tract Society, 1840). Other notable early works include the paintings Rockland Lake (1840; unlocated), which was reproduced in The Token and Atlantic Souvenir of 1842,The Token and Atlantic Souvenir, An Offering for Christmas and the New Year (Boston: David H. Williams, 1842). Talbot’s engraving illustrates a poem by H. T. Tuckerman. and The Happy Valley (1841), based on Samuel Johnson’s Rasselas (private collection). These paintings caught the attention of the critics and fellow artists, with many praising his use of atmosphere and comparing him to Thomas Cole.Jessica Skwire Routhier, “Fellow Journeyers Walt Whitman and Jesse Talbot: Painting, Poetry, and Puffery in 1850s New York.” Walt Whitman Quarterly Review 38 (2020): 9. https://doi.org/10.13008/0737-0679.2386.Wendy Jean Katz, Humbug! The Politics of Art Criticism in New York City’s Penny Press (New York: Fordham University Press, 2020), 115–18. The painter Jasper Francis Cropsey said that Talbot was “third in excellence” among American landscape painters, after Cole and Asher Brown Durand.Jasper Francis Cropsey, “Natural Art,” lecture to be given at the Art ReUnion, August 24, 1845, transcription in the collections of the Newington-Cropsey Foundation. He became an Associate Member of the National Academy in 1845.\\"National Academicians,\\" National Academy of Design, https://www.nationalacademy.org/academicians In 1844 Talbot moved to Paterson, New Jersey, on the falls of the Passaic River.Cowdrey’s National Academy of Design Exhibition Record lists his address in Paterson from 1844 through 1847 (150–51). His 1845 painting of the falls is in the collection of the New Jersey Historical Society. While based in Paterson, he continued to submit works for the annual exhibitions of the National Academy and the American Art- Union. His 1847 painting Christian at the Cross (private collection), based on John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress, was exhibited at both venues in that year and received critical acclaim from the New York press.Routhier, “Fellow Journeyers,” 14–17. Two years later, in 1849, he produced another canvas based on The Pilgrim’s Progress, entitled Departure of Christian from the Palace, Called Beautiful, which he exhibited at the National Academy. Although he completed both of these paintings when other National Academy artists were conceptualizing a major moving panorama based on The Pilgrim’s Progress, Talbot was not credited as a contributor to that project.Jessica Skwire Routhier, Kevin J. Avery, and Thomas Hardiman Jr., The Painters’ Panorama: Narrative, Art, and Faith in the Moving Panorama of Pilgrim’s Progress (Hanover: University Press of New England, 2015). This may suggest that, despite his critical success, he was not part of the inner circle of New York–based landscape painters at the time. = Friendship with Walt Whitman = Jesse Talbot (American, 1805–1879), Christian at the Cross, 1847, oil on canvas, 29 x 57 in. Private collection. Photo by Bif Hendrix By 1850, Talbot returned from Paterson to New York, where he lived in Brooklyn and maintained a studio in Manhattan.By 1850, Talbot appears on the King’s County census records with his wife, three children, and a servant. His Manhattan studio address is provided in his listing in the New York Mercantile Union Business Directory for 1850, under “Painters, Landscape.” At this time he began a friendship with Walt Whitman, then a 31-year-old journalist. Whitman wrote about Talbot three times in 1850, including a retrospective of the artist’s career to date in which he discusses Rockland Lake, The Happy Valley, and Talbot’s two paintings based on The Pilgrim’s Progress.[Walt Whitman], “April Afternoon Ramble,” Brooklyn Evening Star (April 30 1850); “Works of Beauty and Talent—The New Art Union of Brooklyn,” Brooklyn Daily Advertiser (April 4 1850); and “American Art—Jesse Talbot.” Whitman also visited Talbot’s home in Brooklyn, a fact that is supported by Talbot’s name and address (on Brooklyn’s Wilson Street) inscribed on the front cover of Whitman’s so-called “Talbot Wilson notebook,”The Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1842–1937, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., available on the Walt Whitman Archive (www.whitmanarchive.org): https://whitmanarchive.org/manuscripts/notebooks/transcriptions/loc.00141.html in which the poet first wrote down the ideas that would become his celebrated volume Leaves of Grass, first published in 1855. In 1891, Talbot’s daughter Mary Augusta (Talbot) Burhans wrote to Whitman on his deathbed, recalling his repeated visits to the Talbot family home: “Believe me Honored Sir, I can see the Yorkville Stage stopping at our door pleasant summer afternoons in 1852 and Walt Whitman and Jesse Talbot getting down from the upper most [stage?] and then the long and instructive chats, over good coffee, and paintings.”Routhier, “Fellow Journeyers,” 17–18. Whitman wrote about Talbot at least three more times in 1851, 1852, and 1853, in a series of articles criticizing the National Academy for not accepting Talbot’s 1851 painting Encampment of the Caravan (unlocated).Wendy J[ean]. Katz, “Previously Undocumented Art Criticism by Walt Whitman.” Walt Whitman Quarterly Review 32 (2015): 215–29. . The articles are “Encampment of the Caravan,” Evening Post, April 21, 1851; “An Hour at the Academy of Design,” New York Sunday Dispatch, April 25, 1852; and “Talbot’s Pictures,” American Phrenological Journal, February 1853. An earlier article in the American Phrenological Journal 15, no. 1 (January 1852), entitled “Talbot, the Painter,” also mentions the Encampment painting and may be by Whitman. The last of these, published in The American Phrenological Journal of 1853, confirms that Whitman owned a smaller version (unlocated) of Talbot’s Christian at the Cross. Whitman later surrendered the painting to creditors.Walt Whitman to William D. O’Connor, September 28, 1869, The Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., available on the Walt Whitman Archive (www.whitmanarchive.org): https://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/tei/loc.01689.html. = Decline and death = Jesse Talbot, Tropical Scenery–Early Morning, 1850, oil on canvas. Collections of the Dyer Library and Saco Museum, Saco, Maine. Photo by Martha Cox. Talbot continued to produce major paintings in the early 1850s, including Tropical Scenery—Early Morning, now at the Saco Museum; two paintings depicting the mythical “Phantom Ship” of New Haven, Connecticut, now at the New Haven Museum; and, all currently unlocated, On the Juniata (engraved to accompany a text by Bayard Taylor for The Home Book of the Picturesque); Discovery of the Hudson; and Indian’s Last Gaze.For the engraving of On the Juniata, see Bayard Taylor, “The Scenery of Pennsylvania,” in The Home Book of the Picturesque: Or American Scenery, Art, and Literature (New York: G. P. Putnam, 1852), between pages 94 and 95. Several small-scale versions of Indian’s Last Gaze have appeared in public art sales at Christie’s and Sotheby’s. An unidentified painting of his was also the subject of an 1855 poem by Park Benjamin.Park Benjamin, “On a Small Landscape,” Ballou’s Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion 9 (1855), 59. However, as the decade wore on, Talbot participated in fewer public exhibitions, apparently suffering a career setback with the 1852 dissolution of the American Art-Union. His series on the sons of Noah, exhibited at Brooklyn’s Polytechnic Institute in 1862, was his last artistic effort to draw significant critical attention.The sons of Noah paintings were presented alongside a lecture by the Rev. Samuel Hanson Cox, “Chancellor of the Ingham University, Leroy, New York.” “Talbot’s Great Paintings,” Brooklyn Daily Eagle, April 17, 1862. There is some evidence that Talbot may have suffered from alcoholism, hastening the decline of his career. Cropsey had described Talbot, in 1846, as the “drunkest man in Passaic [County],”Jasper Francis Cropsey to Maria Cooley, November 12–17, 1846, transcription in the collections of the Newington-Cropsey Foundation. and some remarks made by the painters Daniel Huntington and Jervis McEntee after Talbot’s death suggest that he died in poverty brought on by his “lack of severe discipline.”Minutes of the National Academy of Design, February 10, 1879, quoted in Dearinger, Paintings and Sculpture, 383. In the 1860s and 1870s, Talbot changed home and studio addresses frequently and lived for some time with his married daughter Mary Augusta, in Rondout, New York, in Ulster County.Routhier, “Fellow Journeyers,” 25. By 1879 Talbot was back in Brooklyn, where on January 24 he slipped on the ice at the corner of DeKalb and Broadway.“Fatal Effects of a Fall,” Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 30 1879. He died as a result on January 29 at his home on Lafayette Avenue. His funeral was held there on January 31 and attended by Huntington, McEntee, and the artists Sanford Robinson Gifford and Richard William Hubbard. McEntee’s diary entry from that day suggests Talbot’s straitened circumstances at the time of his death: “There were quite a number of very nice looking people at the funeral. I feared there would be but few. . . . The house looked poor enough but much better than I feared it would.”Jervis McEntee Diaries, entry for January 31, 1879, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, https://aaa.si.edu/collection-features/jervis-mcentee-diaries/diary- entry?date=18790131. Talbot was buried in the cemetery of the Dutch Reformed Church in Claverack.“Jesse Talbot,” https://findagrave.com/memorial/55213429/jesse-talbot. In memorial remarks made at a meeting of the National Academy on February 10, 1879, Huntington, then the Academy’s president, said that Talbot’s “first brilliant promise as an Amateur was not fulfilled in later years from the lack of severe discipline.”Minutes of the National Academy of Design, February 10, 1879, quoted in David B. Dearinger, ed., Paintings and Sculpture in the Collection of the National Academy of Design, Volume 1, 1826–1925 (New York and Manchester: Hudson Hills Press, 2004), 383. McEntee attended the same meeting and wrote in his diary that members of the Academy voted to provide financial assistance to the Talbot family by defraying funeral expenses and reducing the commission on his paintings sold through the Academy.Jervis McEntee Diaries, entry for February 10 1879, https://aaa.si.edu/collection-features/jervis- mcentee-diaries/diary-entry?date=18790210.

A printer by trade, Ford had been a president of the Toronto Labour Council and was its secretary when he was first elected to the Board of Control in the 1951 Toronto municipal election after an unsuccessful bid the previous year. However, one of the reasons he lost the mayoral race for working curb the right of civic workers to strike by having them declared essential services under the Ontario Labor Relations Act, which earned him the ire of the labour movement.

The full installation of the work will run about 1,680 feet in length. Die Plage (English: The Plague) is a large-scale photomontage installation by artist and composer Harley Gaber (1943–2011) consisting of roughly 4,200 canvases that interpret German history from the Weimar Republic to the end of World War II. Gaber worked on Die Plage between 1993 and 2002, incorporating paint, charcoal, and xerography into his photomontage technique, and exhibiting the work in several stages of completion. As of September 2020, Die Plage has not yet been exhibited in its entirety, which would run over long were it displayed as intended in a series of panels, five canvases high, about . Gaber distinguished Die Plage from other art historical Holocaust renderings in that this work \\"arises out of the collision between external circumstances and internal, personal circumstances,\\" as it seeks to individualize perpetrators and victims of the Holocaust alike. Eight years after Gaber's death in 2011, the Gaber estate gifted Die Plage to the Chicago-based Dan J. Epstein Family Foundation. The Foundation subsequently commissioned the digital scanning and cataloging of the work by Art Authority, and is seeking exhibition opportunities.  Background  Gaber began work on Die Plage in November 1993, shortly after the death of his close friend and mentor, composer Kenneth Gaburo. Gaburo had been Gaber's music professor at the University of Illinois. Gaber was a highly trained musician and composer who had published several CD's of electronic music with acclaim, but never formally studied visual art. He worked exclusively on Die Plage until 2002. During those nine years, he moved four times, serving as primary care-giver for his father until he died in 1998. Gaber had a lifelong fascination with German culture: historical references recur throughout the entirety of his creative output, in visual arts and music alike, though nowhere more thoroughly than in Die Plage. Gaber's Die Plage may refer to Albert Camus' 1947 work of the same name, La Peste, a novel about political morality and humanity during a plague in Algeria as an allegory of the French resistance to Nazi occupation in World War II.  Technique and organization  To make the canvases in Die Plage, Gaber used a range of techniques including collage, photomontage, painting, xerographic manipulation, pastel, and charcoal. Razor blades and scissors were Gaber's primary tools. Although it was available, Gaber did not use photoshop in his alterations. Gaber gathered historic images and iconography from books, archives, and magazines; he then xeroxed, cut, spliced, and adhered images to the canvas with gesso or a heat gun. He gathered these materials from libraries and archives in the U.S., and from his many trips to Germany. The canvases, each measuring 16 by 20 inches, are framed with thin, light wood. Aside from the occasional application of blue paint, Gaber confined all of the other 4,200 canvases to a black-and-white palette. Die Plage as a whole (running across the walls in five straight, continuous lines) mimics the form of sheet music, while the blank canvases create the sensation that the work is shaped in part by blank canvases that act as notations for \\"pause and counterpoint,\\" as rest notes would. Gaber's approach to Die Plage draws inspiration from German photomontage pioneers Hannah Höch, John Heartfield, and George Grosz, whose influence is acknowledged in several canvases within the series. Höch, Heartfield, and Grosz, as artistic collaborators in the avant-garde Dadaist and New Objectivity movements, were credited with inventing the \\"anti-art\\" technique of pasting together pre-existing photographs, text, and clippings. Several of these works are themselves cut and pasted into Die Plage, including the notable example of Adolf Hitler's head in Heartfield's Adolf, the Superman: Swallows Gold and Spouts Tin (1932). Gaber separated Die Plage into four discrete parts or movements, much like a symphony. The first section is dedicated to the Weimar Republic (1918–1933) and the first seven years of the Third Reich, including Hitler's rise in popularity, propaganda campaigns, the political defamation of modern art, the 1936 Olympics and the 1937 Entartete Kunst exhibition. Section II depicts persecution of the Jews. In this section, Gaber painted directly on the collages with abstract strokes of gray and blue. Section III reimagines the events in the prior two sections from more subjective points-of-view, and Section IV serves as an epilogue. The density of images within the canvases, and the rhythm of canvases within panels, change notably in each section. Jonathan Saville of the San Diego Reader described the relationship between Die Plage's movements, writing, \\"images are introduced like musical themes, reappearing again and again, continually transformed.\\" The sections and their sub-themes, according to Gaber, \\"flow\\" as they move between \\"broad historical premises and a private, intimate nightmare. Someone goes through this and finds his or her own way through it.\\" From the photomontage installation of \\"Die Plage\\" by Harley Gaber, exhibited at Half Moon Bay Coastal Repertory Theater, 1997  Artistic intention  Gaber wrote in the program for his Half Moon Bay Coastal Repertory Theater exhibit: Gaber believed photomontage had the effect of \\"reenergizing\\" historical photographic subjects, altering them and therefore humanizing the victims and perpetrators alike. In returning humanity to the people involved in carrying out the Holocaust, Gaber wanted to articulate a repudiation of the Holocaust as an \\"abberation,\\" or \\"a part of history so terrible as to be disbelievable.\\" Gaber explained, \\"People have removed the event from history... I'm acting in the spirit of trying to explain how it did happen. I'm asking, how do things happen, and how did this thing happen.'\\" [emphasis added].

In response to the 1995 Southwestern College exhibit of Die Plage's first 950 canvases, Johnathan Saville, writing for the San Diego Reader wrote: Saville labeled Die Plage \\"a major work of art of great splendor and profundity,\\" adding that the work is among \\"the most searing and poignant treatments, in any genre, of the Nazis' extermination of the Jews,\\" and \\"one of the supreme aesthetic statements of the 20th Century.\\" John Oxendine, writing in the San Mateo Times on October 1, 1994, understood Die Plage as the representation of individuals within a collective historical moment. According to Oxendine, Gaber \\"puts forth his argument for humanity as the images eviscerate and gush forth with a deep desire to bring the importance of the subject (not the event) before us, showing us the saddening plight of the victims, as he re-lives their despair when he brings them back to life.\\" More broadly, \\"The Holocaust is the central event through which Gaber filters his vision of the consequences of our concerns for technology and power rather than humanity.\\" From September 23 to October 25, 2000, The Laboratory gallery in Los Angeles displayed about 700 of Die Plage's canvases. Los Angeles Times art critic Leah Ollman described the work this way: Not all critics were ready to praise Gaber's work. Mark Shlim, after seeing the installation at The Laboratory in Los Angeles, critiqued Die Plage in an essay in Artists' News in April 2000, alleging that Gaber's art- historical collages amounted to an appropriation of the Shoah's place in the Jewish 20th century identity. Shlim posited that Gaber's decision to alter \\"images sacred to the Jews\\" lacked artistic justification.

Monatsschrift für Gemüt und Geist was the name of a National conservative, Protestant cultural journal, which appeared first in Stuttgart and then in Berlin from 1898 to 1943 and was published for a long time by the Baltic German writer , who lived in Bad Oeynhausen. The name was intended to refer to the tower keeper from Faust, Part Two: \\"Zum Sehen geboren, zum Schauen bestellt.\\" (Born to see, ordered to look.)  History  The journal sought to give a view of the entire intellectual and social culture of the present day; since 1902 the \\"Türmer-Jahrbuch\\" (Türmer Yearbook) had been published alongside. Grotthuß made der Türmer a central cultural and political medium of the Wilhelminian period. From 3000 (in 1899), the number of copies printed per month climbed to 17,500. In the section \\"Türmers Tagebuch\\" Grotthuß attacked the social democracy, court nobility, money aristocracy and industry, which he accused of \\"Byzantinism\\", and \\"political eunuchy\\". In 1918, he sided with the old order against the republic and became a fierce advocate of the Stab-in-the-back myth. When he died in 1920, der Türmer was \\"well on his way to becoming one of the strongest and most dangerous opponents of the Weimar system\\". Grotthuß oriented himself towards the movement. His successor was the Alsatian Heimatkünstler Friedrich Lienhard, who steered the magazine into völkische waters. In 1929, the early National Socialist Friedrich Castelle took over the publication and brought in the two völkisch magazines Deutsche Monatshefte and Die Bergstadt. In 1943, the magazine was integrated into the Westermanns Monatshefte. The printing and publishing of the magazine was done by Greiner and Pfeifer in Stuttgart until 1930, then by the national socialist Beenken-Verlag.Neuauflage (Mikrofiche) bei Harald Fischer Verlag Walter Ehrenstein, Hedwig Forstreuter, Stephan Ley, Otto Rennefeld, Otto von Taube, Karl August Walther and Reinhold Zimmermann were among the authors writing for der Türmer.

She came to wider prominence through her television and radio appearances after 1962. By the time reunification arrived in 1990 she had become a leading star of the small screen in East Germany. She fell terminally ill and then died shortly afterwards, possibly because of the extent of her addiction to cigarettes: she was 54. Her death left unanswered the question of how successfully her performances might have captivated pan-German television audiences post unification. The annual \\"Goldene Henne\\" (literally \\"Golden Hen\\") prize was inaugurated in 1995 to celebrate and commemorate her. (One of Helga Hahnemann's informal soubriquets among fans was \\"Henne\\".)  Life and career  Helga \\"Henne\\" Hahnemann was born in Berlin-Wilhelmsruh, the youngest of her parents' four children, a couple of years before war broke out. Wilhelmsruh was a central quarter of Berlin which after 1945 would find itself administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. The zone was rebranded and relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). She later told an interviewer that she discovered her talent for comedy while still at school. Passing her Abitur (school final exams) opened the way for a university-level education: between 1956 and 1959 Hahnemann studied at the Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts in Berlin- Niederschöneweide. In 1959 she made her stage debut with Die Pfeffermühle (literally, \\"The Pepper Mill\\"), a mildly edgy cabaret ensemble established five years earlier in Leipzig. She found Leipzig did not suit her, however, and returned in 1961 or 1962 to Berlin, where she concentrated on cabaret and comedy genres, working on a freelance basis, primarily with one-woman programmes. Increasingly, however, she found herself undertaking work for DFF, East Germany's party-controlled monopoly broadcaster. Her work covered television and radio work as well as voice-acting assignments. Some of her best remembered appearances from this time were on the regular satirical comedy show, \\"Tele-BZ\\". Her appearances as the main attraction on \\"Tele-BZ\\", which soon won a nationwide audience of several million for the shows in which she appeared, continued for three decades, earning her the prestigious arts prize of the East German Trades Union Federation. Eventually, in 1969, Hahnemann joined the broadcaster's payroll as a member of the \\"DFF Drama Ensemble\\" (\\"Schauspielerensemble des DFF\\"). She remained on the payroll for the next 21 years, despite an annual salary of 1,500 Ostmarks, which even then was a relatively modest amount: by 1990 it had increased to 2,100 Ostmarks. 1974 marked the start of a productive seventeen partnership with the scriptwriter Angela Gentzmer who worked with her on song lyrics and sketches. At least one source describes the two women as a \\"dream team\\". Where the dream team needed a new tune, the composer Arndt Bause would produce another from his apparently endless stream of new dance music melodies. The material Hahnemann was now using made her \\"the voice of the little man\\". There are suggestions that she was allowed a certain measure of license that a more overtly political performer would have been denied. At the end of the 1970s she began working with the Berliner Rundfunk (\\"East Berlin Radio\\") as a moderator-presenter on her programme \\"Helgas Top(p)-Musike\\", which also formed the basis for three television programmes. Success as a singer continued with \\"Schlager\\" numbers - many employing local Berlin dialect - such as \\"Wo ist mein Jeld bloß geblieben\\", \\" Jetzt kommt dein Süße\\", \\"U-Bahn-Beat\\", \\"100 mal Berlin\\", \\"Clärchens Ballhaus\\" (sung as a duet with Hartmut Schulze-Gerlach), and \\"Een kleenet Menschenkind\\". Another much loved programme which Hahnemann regularly presented was Ein Kessel Buntes, a Saturday evening television variety show. She performed with actor-comedians such as Alfred Müller, Herbert Köfer, Dagmar Gelbke and Ingeborg Naß in a wide variety of television comedy sketches. She appeared regularly alongside Rolf Herricht, Gerd E. Schäfer, Margot Ebert, Traute Sense and Heinz Behrens in her role as \\"Erna Mischke\\" in the long-running light-hearted television drama series Maxe Baumann. She teamed up with Ingeborg Naß to head up workers' cabaret in Berlin. Hahnemann also progressed her career as a voice-over artist. Of particular note in this context was the use of her voice for Yvonne Jensen, the main female protagonist in the popular German-language versions for 3 of the 14 (filmed in Danish) Olsen Gang movies. The changes which led the German Democratic Republic to democracy were followed, formally in October 1990, by German reunification. Hahnemann set about trying to win over audiences in a very different kind of Germany, in which western social and economic norms tended to trump those that had emerged in the east under Soviet socialism. However, she was already terminally ill. There were well advanced plans for a new years eve \\"television spectacular\\" on 31 December 1990 / 1 January 1991 with Helga Hahnemann presenting it. In the event she was too ill to participate. It remains unclear when she realised the seriousness of her physical problems. Sources indicate that \\"Big Helga\\" had long been noted as a big eater, and she was a heavy smoker. There are indications that for several months she held off visiting a doctor in pursuit of a diagnosis. She was keen that \\"the public should say she was 100% fit when she died\\". According to at least one source the late-stage lung cancer diagnosis came through in November 1991, when only a couple of weeks of life were left to her.  Celebration (selection)  * In 1982 Hahnemann was a recipient of the Art Prize of the German Democratic Republic. The National Prize (Arts and Literature: class III) came in 1987. * The annual \\"Goldene Henne\\" audience prize, organised and awarded since 1995 by the magazine Superillu, along with the broadcasters Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (Leipzig) and RBB (Berlin), is dedicated to her. * A new community activities centre was opened in Schöneiche, where Hahnemann made her home for many years, in 2000. It is named \\"Helga-Hahnemann-Haus\\" in her honour. Appropriately, one of the uses made of the hall is as a music school. In 2014 the municipality unveiled a proposal to sell it in response to a desperate shortage of municipal funds, but following a public uproar the council voted down the idea. * A footpath in the centre of Berlin carries her name. * A street in Schönefeld carried her name. * A star on Berlin's expanding Boulevard of the Stars was dedicated to Helga Hahnemann on 10 September 2010. * The artist Joachim Tilsch has created a large mural image entitled \\"Schöneicher Frühstück\\" (\\"Schöneicher Breakfast\\"), depicting three recently deceased celebrity entertainment artists, for the main shopping centre in Schöneiche.

February 8, 1957) is a Japanese prosecutor who served as chief of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office from January 2019 to May 2020. The extension of his term of office by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in February 2020, followed by his resignation for misconduct in May 2020, sparked political controversy in Japan.  Early life  Kurokawa was born in Tokyo and graduated from the University of Tokyo Faculty of Law in 1981. He completed legal training in 1983 and thereafter worked as a prosecutor in various posts throughout Japan.  Roles under Shinzo Abe government  Japan's highest prosecutor, the Prosecutor-General, customarily serves for two-year terms. Kurokawa and Makoto Hayashi were known as the two best prosecutors of their class, and were considered leading contenders to become Prosecutor-General as of the mid-2010s. However, Kurokawa was promoted to Vice-Minister of Justice in September 2016, placing him in a coordination role with senior Cabinet members such as Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, while Hayashi was placed in charge of the prosecutors' office in Nagoya. Kurokawa was the top bureaucrat in the Justice Ministry during the investigation of Moritomo Gakuen, a private school that was embroiled in a scandal surrounding a purchase of land from the government. Shukan Bunshun reported in December 2018 that Kurokawa helped to quash the investigation despite the top prosecutor in Osaka wanting to pursue indictment. Kurokawa was appointed Head of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office in January 2019, at the initiative of former Justice Minister and prosecutor Takashi Yamashita. At the time, authorities saw Hayashi as the most likely candidate for next Prosecutor-General, as Kurokawa's mandatory retirement would come at the age of 63 in February 2020, months before incumbent Prosecutor-General Nobuo Inada's scheduled retirement in July, which coincided with Hayashi's turning 63. According to a Nikkei report, the government came to consider appointing both Kurokawa and Hayashi to one-year terms so that they could both serve as Prosecutor-General, but this would require an extension of the retirement age. = Retirement controversy = In late January 2020, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided to extend Kurokawa's term to August 2020. The government argued that the extension was legal under Japan's National Public Service Act, while the opposition argued that this was inconsistent with past interpretation of the law, and that the extension was a political move meant to allow Kurokawa to replace Japan's Prosecutor-General Nobuo Inada. Constitutional Democratic Party leader Yukio Edano described Kurokawa as controlling judicial administration in compliance with Abe's directives. The extension resulted in a no confidence motion by the opposition against Justice Minister Masako Mori, which was voted down by the ruling parties. Following the controversy over Kurokawa's retirement, Prime Minister Abe and Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai agreed to a bill that would extend the mandatory retirement age of all prosecutors; however, the bill was abandoned due to a lack of understanding among the public. The legislation had been publicly opposed in a Twitter campaign involving a number of Japanese celebrities, including Arata Irua, Tadanobu Asano, Sayaka Akimoto, Chica Umino, Kotobuki Shiriagari, and Kayoko Okubo. Former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara publicly commented that the Cabinet sought to appoint Kurokawa as Prosecutor- General in order to gain greater control over the public prosecutor's office, which had historically operated with a great deal of independent power, most notably its takedown of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka in the 1970s. Gohara also commented that incumbent Prosecutor-General Inada preferred Hayashi as his successor and resented the Cabinet's support of Kurokawa. = Resignation = Kurokawa resigned from office in May 2020 after admitting to gambling on mahjong with reporters in violation of social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. He was formally warned about his conduct, which Justice Minister Mori described as \\"truly inappropriate and extremely regrettable.\\" The Asahi Shimbun reported that the Justice Ministry initially planned to issue a formal reprimand, but that the Cabinet decided to impose a lesser punishment. Kurokawa was also accused of bribery with regard to taking luxury taxis hired by the Sankei Shimbun newspaper. Prosecutors decided not to indict Kurokawa or the reporters for these offenses, on the basis that the amounts involved were not large and that Kurokawa had already been socially punished. Public dissatisfaction over Prime Minister Abe's handling of the resignation led to Abe's support levels falling from 40% to 27% in May 2020, a record low since he took office in 2012. Abe announced his resignation later that year.

Later the collapse of the Empire brought with it a collapse of Anagni's population and parts of the lower town became overgrown. = Bishops and Popes = Front and Campanile of the Anagni Cathedral. Nevertheless there has been a Bishop of Anagni, since at least the 5th century, while the present Anagni Cathedral, known to have been built on the emplacement of a temple dedicated to the Goddess Ceres, dates to the 9th century. The Popes, too, were active at Anagni. It was in Anagni in 1122 that Pope Callistus II promulgated the Concordat of Worms and the Englishman Pope Adrian IV, born Nicholas Breakspeare, died there in 1159. In 1160, Pope Alexander III excommunicated the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in Anagni Cathedral. This presence continued in other centuries, for in 1255 Saint Clare of Assisi was canonized in in the same Cathedral by Alexander IV (1254–1261), who likewise chose the same location to move in the dispute between the University of Paris and the Mendicant Orders by condemning, on 5 October 1256, William of Saint-Amour's work De periculis novissimorum temporum (On the Dangers of the Last Days). This papal presence, as shown below, in later times intensified. = The Counts of Segni = It is difficult to disentangle the different construction phases of the various parts on the palace as it now exists. Some Teresa Rinaldi. suggest there were seven phases in the construction: in the late 12th, century or early 13th a late medieval fortification with two towers would have been incorporated into the main block, which would have led to a structure with transversed by arches surmounted by wooden ceilings. The fact that the measurement employed seem to be French, has lead to the hypothesi that the workforce was French or French trained, possibly through the Cistercensian Order. In fact, not far away, at Fossanova, Cistercensian monks from outside Italy were working on the construction of Fossanova Abbey, consecrated in 1208 by Pope Innocent III,who was born Lothar of Segni at Gavignano near Anagni. Olivier Hanne, De Lothaire à Innocent III. L’ascension d’un clerc au XII siècle, Presses universitaires de Provence, Aix-en-Provence, 2014; Achille Luchaire, Innocent III, Rome et l’Italie, Hachette, Paris, 1904, pp. 1-12. Arms of the Counts of Segni Were this suggestion true, it would lend support also to the notion that Innocent had a role in the earliest structure on the site, though the construction of the southern wing and two floors resting on the previous fortifications, along with the heightening of the wing to the north, would have been undertaken in the time of Innocent’s next-but- one successor, Pope Gregory IX Conti, like Innocent, and a total of seven other popes, (including Clement III, Alexander IV and far later Innocent XIII),Jane Sayers, Innocent III: Leader of Europe 1199–1216, London 1994, p. 16; Eamon Duffy, Saints and Sinners, History of the Popes, Yale University Press, 1997, p. 110. a member of the noble clan of the Counts of Segni. The enlargement of the east wing, on the other hand, was presumably the work of the Caetani. Other hypotheses have proposed that most of it was simply built by Pope Boniface VIII, Rossana Ferretti, ‘I palazzi di Gregorio IX e Bonifacio VIII’, in Storia della Città 18 (1980) 62-76. while others Giovanni Carbonara, 'Sul cosiddetto Palazzo di Bonifacio VIII in Anagni. Dalla storia al restauro', in Palladio 3 (1989) 19-60. have thought it possible to identify no less than fifteen different phases of construction, nine traceable to the 10th-11th and 15th centuries, others in the earlier 13th century effected the joining together of two separate residences of the end of the 12th century, thus creating a modest romanesque palazzetto with an adjacent tower. This would then have been modified later in the same century according to Gothic tastes and enlarged by powerful arches mounted on tall columns. Sala delle Oche, west wall. The sources leave no doubt as to the existence of a building already about the beginning of the thirteenth century, but archeological analysis of the stratification of successive constructions on the site suggest the presence of far earlier structures. The site certainly housed the residence of Ugolino Conti, Pope Gregory IX, Eamon Duffy, Saints and Sinners, History of the Popes, Yale University Press, 1997, pp. 115-116. which was referred to as maius (greater) given its prominence. Gregory, Eamon Duffy, Saints and Sinners, History of the Popes, Yale University Press, 1997, pp. 115-116. had been born in Anagni and that construction was linked to a piece of land that had been owned by Pope Gregory’s father, Matthias, and must have been completed by the first quarter of the thirteenth century, a period marked by an upsurge of building throughout Anagnil. Upon his election as Pope in 1227, Gregory assigned his possessions, including the palace, to his niece Maria, daughter of his brother Adinolf, while specifying his own right and that of his family members to live there. A gold “augustale” (1231-1250) depicting Frederick II as Emperor Another of the first acts of Gregory’s pontificate, one which reverberated far more widely, was his decision to excommunicate the Emperor Frederick II for failing to see through his participation in the Sixth Crusade in breach of a vow. This was accomplished by means of a solemn declaration made in Anagni Cathedral on 29 September 1227. Stung by this, Frederick attempted the following year an invasion of the Papal States. Its failure then forced him to seek reconciliation with the Pope. Pascal Montaubin, 'Entre gloire curiale et vie commune: le chapitre cathédral d'Anagni au XIII siècle', in Mélanges de l'École française de Rome 109 (1997) pp. 303-442. As a result, around 20 or 23 July 1230 the Treaty of San Germano was signed Frédéric Schoell & Franz Xaver Zach, Cours d'histoire des États européens, vol. IV, Gide, Paris, 1830, pp. 190-193. and the Pope’s rescinding of the excommunication was not long in coming. This whole complex episode was played for all it was worth by both sides, the Pope displaying his triumph and the Emperor putting a brave face on events in as far as he could. On 1 September 1230 came the politically necessary personal encounter between Gregory and Frederick. In all this, it should be recalled that while the scion of a German dynasty, Frederick had been born in central Italy, at Jesi, near Ancona. The setting for this particular meeting between Pope and Emperor was the palace at Anagni, when it is said that the two 'sat together at table, in a splendid gathering of princes and notables',Vita Gregori IX, cf. Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores 19, 362. convoked to highlight the earnestness of their reconciliation. Frederick would not forget that visit, and in a letter of 1239, after a new clash with Gregory, accused the Pope of having lost sight of the poverty of the Apostle Peter, the proof being the residence he had created for himself at Anagni, a truly opulent royal palace. '[...] ut testatur Anagnia, mandasti statim domum fieri mirabilem, sicut regia solis erat, oblitus prorsus Petri inopiae qui dudum non habuit, nisi rete', Pier della Vigna, Epistolario, VI, I, 1 . In this new clash of 1239, Gregory again launched an excommunication against Frederick, but the Pope did not see the end of the armed hostilities that followed, dying on 22 August 1241. = The 1243 Anagni Conclave = It was at Anagni, after the sede vacante of no less than 19 months which followed the 17-day pontificate of Celestine IV (died 10 November 1241), that Cardinal Sinibaldo Fieschi was elected Pope on 25 June 1243. Eamon Duffy, Saints and Sinners, History of the Popes, Yale University Press, 1997, p. 116 Though apparently with considerable reluctance, he accepted the election and on 28 June was crowned as Pope Innocent IV. Eamon Duffy, Saints and Sinners, History of the Popes, Yale University Press, 1997, pp. 110-115, 127. He left Anagni immediately, and when it became clear that not only was the struggle with the Emperor Frederick II not coming to an end but was intensifying, he fled Rome on 7 June 1244Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), p. 969. in disguise for his native Liguria and four months later journeyed on to the city of Lyons, where he was received rapturously by the people and the civil authorities on 29 November 1244. There on 27 December that same year he convoked what became the 13th General (Ecumenical) Council of the Church, the first to be held in Lyon.Ioannes Dominicus Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio Tomus 23 (Venice 1779), pp. 606-686. The connection between Innocent IV and Anagni was not at an end, for a decade or so later another important political summit of the papacy and the civil power took place there in 1254, when Innocent IV received there the ambassadors of the Kingdom of Sicily, in the presence of the cardinals and the people. Bartolommeo Capasso, ‘Historia diplomatica Regni Siciliae’, in Atti della Reale Accademia di archeologia lettere e belle arti Societa reale di Napoli 6/2 (1872) 77. The sources record that this took place 'in palatio domini Matthiae', Matthias was the son and heir of Maria Conti, to whom Gregory IX had in 1227 made over the palace. = Under Boniface VIII = The Caetani arms during the time of Boniface VIII Despite the association of the building with the name of Pope Boniface VIII, Eamon Duffy, Saints and Sinners, History of the Popes, Yale University Press, 1997, pp. 119-122 it became the property of the Pope’s family, the Caetani, only in 1297, some three years after Boniface (born Benedict Caetani) became pope. The property was purchased, perhaps with constraint, from Adinolf and Nicholas, described as the sons of Matthias de Papa, himself the son, as we saw, of Gregory IX's niece Maria Conti. The purchaser was the Pope Boniface’s nephew Peter II Caetani, son of the Pope's brother Roffredo, Count of Caserta, and the purchase was part of a determined campaign by the family over decades to acquire plots of land and houses around the area of Anagni Cathedral. As Benedict Caetani, Peter’s uncle had already long been at work on this project and after his election he continued it, acquiring from 1283 by purchase or exchange an entire area of the town and building on a considerable scale, including the sizeable edifice known today as the Palazzo Traietto, the Caetani Chapel to the south of the Cathedral, the residence of the canons, and enlargements to the bishop’s residence (the Episcopio), whch recent studies have shown was where the notorious Outrage of Anagni (Sciaffo di Anagni) took place. It follows, then, that the Palace of the Popes in Anagni, otherwise known as the Boniface VIII Palace (Palazzo Bonifacio VIII), with a few structural modifications, should be viewed in the context of an urbanistic programme that aimed at the creation of a family fortification on a site protected by the still visible ancient walled defences of the local acropolis, on the model of similar constructions contrived by the families of the Roman nobility. It also aimed at a prestigious display of status by means of the richness of its decorative features. = The Career of Boniface VIII = Formerly a chaplain to the pope, later a legate in France (1265) and in England (1266), a nuncio entrusted with the collecting of taxes (1269), notary to the pope (1276), Benedict Caetani, the future Boniface VIII drew notable levels of finance from the ecclesiastical benefices he managed to acquire, Thomas S.R. Boase, Boniface VIII, Constable, London, 1933, pp. 5-43. including a canonry and further benefice at Anagni Cathedral from 1250 onwards, a canonry at Todi from 1260 and another at Saint Peter’s, Rome, from 1281. The various roles he exercised and the benefices allowed him to amass notable amounts. It is said that on 3 May 1297, when Stefano Colonna carried off the treasure that Boniface was having something in the region of 160,000 florins transported so as to purchase various lands from the Annibaldi family, in pursuit of the plan to piece together a personal estate. The Colonna later accused him of having extorted money from his subjects precisely for that purpose. Without evidence this remains a brazen calumny and the hostility of the Colonna family was demonstrated later. Boniface had entered into conflict with King Philip IV of France in 1296 starting with taxes the king imposed on the clergy, but escalating over time till the moment troops attacked the pope's residence in Anagni on 7 September 1303 and held him prisoner. Boniface was held for three days and beaten badly until the local people of Anagni rose against the invaders and released him. The pope pardoned his captors and returned to Rome on 13 September 1303, badly shaken physically and psychologically, and died a month later, of a high fever or of \\"profound chagrin\\". Barbara Tuchman, A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century, Knopf, New York, 1978, p. 110. The personal assault on Boniface is known as the Outrage of Anagni (Sciaffo di Anagni).

Un Languedocien au service de la monarchie capétienne, Lucie éditions, Nîmes, 2012, pp. 101-128. An ultimate ignominy was Philip’s pressurizing Pope Clement V of the Avignon Papacy into staging a posthumous trial of Boniface. Jean Coste, Boniface VIII en procès: articles d'accusation et dépositions des témoins (1303-1311), L'Erma di Bretschneider, Roma, 1995. Clement also obliged Philip in 1312 by suppressing the king's creditors, the Order of Templars, who were similarly vilified. Despite the sad end of Boniface VIII, it should be recalled that he declared the first great Roman Jubilee or Holy Year in 1300, an innovation that would mark the Catholic Church and European society, and impact permanently for centuries the economy of Rome and its environs. Rome was already the destination for large numbers of pilgrims who were overwhelmed by misfortune but spurred on by their Christian faith. In response to this phenomenon, Boniface VIII issued a bull, Antiquorum habet fida relatio, on 22 February 1300, granting a plenary indulgence (in the terms of Catholic doctrine) to pilgrims or Rome residents undertaking certain visits to the basilicas of St. Peter and St. Paul in Rome. As news spread, this lead to tens of thousands of pilgrims visiting [Rome], including Dante Alighieri and the artists Cimabue and Giotto. Although not used in the document, this came to be described as the “jubilee year”, and later still popularly as a \\"holy year\\", which Pope Boniface VIII intended to recur every hundred years, though the interval has varied over the centuries. Herbert Thurston, The Holy Year of Jubilee: An Account of the History and Ceremonial of the Roman Jubilee 1900, Sands, London, 1900, pp. 1-27; Arsenio Frugoni, Il giubileo di Bonifacio VIII, 1950, republished Laterza, Rome, Bari, 1999. = After the Caetani = Mother Claudia De Angelis The palace remained in the Caetani family till 1690, when it passed by the terms of the will of Marquis Orazio Caetani to the noble but impoverished Astalli family, with whom the Caetani had connections through intermarriage. In 1764 the last of this family, Tiberio degli Astalli the Younger, died in debt and it was then that the Cistercian Sisters of Charity, founded within living memory by the local woman Claudia De Angelis (1675-1715), acquired ownership, making it part of their adjacent motherhouse, a relatively recent construction. This operation, which created a property of no mean size, included turning some of the halls into grain stores and others into part of a girls’ convent school and of other works run by the Sisters. Other than the museum and the convent, the building continues to house an elementary school. From the early eighteenth century onwards the basic structure of the palace did not undergo further modifications of any importance, but merely maintenance work and occasional changes of use. The Museum Groundplan of the museum areas in the Anagni Palace of the Popes. In 1950 the archeologist Giuseppe Marchetti Longhi created on the site a permanent exhibition about Pope Boniface VIII and the the first great Christian Jubilee of 1350. From these beginnings the exhibition gradual grew after 1953 with additional archeological finds, plaster casts, photographs, maps and historical documentation and was given the name Museo bonifaciano e del Lazio meridionale (Boniface Museum of Southern Lazio). It was the first museum properly so called open to the public in Anagni. In the decade after the year 2000, it was reorganized to become a distinct section within a larger museum of the Anagni Palace of the Popes. This latter was designed to bring out in a clearer way the architectural structure of the building, its historical importance and its consistent religious character down the centuries, by organizing an interesting route for those visiting the complex of buildings. Apart from the inherent historical significance of the older rooms, a certain number of collections are included which are linked to episodes that intervened down the long centuries. Interior of the museum. = Collection of Inscriptions = An example of these can be found on the ground-floor, in what is named the Sala delle Lapidi. This contains unexpectedly a collection of marble slabs or substantial memorial plaques in marble, of which many display inscriptions or occasionally depictions of figures. The inscriptions, in Latin and Greek, whether pagan or Christian, were found in various of the Roman catacombs, including those of Calepodius, Commodilla, Domitilla, Callixtus, Saint Agnes, and Priscilla. Traditio legis, depiction on marble These marble pieces were brought to Anagni from 1720 onwards and incorporated into the pavement and along the walls of the Sisters’ church. The initiative came from Marcantonio Boldetti and Giovanni Marangoni, both involved in the foundation of the Cistercian Sisters of Charity, and both official overseers of the Roman catacombs in the years 1700-1753. In the early years of the twentieth century the slabs were moved once more and located as at present on the instruction of the Bishop of Anagni, Antonino Sardi (1849-1917). One of the most notable and exquisite pieces in this collection is a depiction, dated to about 390 A.D., of the iconographical topos, the Traditio legis, with Christ handing down the New Law to the Apostles Peter and Paul. The slab bearing this image was apparently not used to close a tomb, but was a decorative feature within the tomb where it was discovered.Dimitri Cascianelli, 'Pasquale Testini e la Traditio legis di Anagni.

His PhD was supervised by Mark Bradley.  Research and career  Upon graduation in 2005, Wong worked as a Postdoctoral researcher with Jason Micklefield at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology investigating on the application of chemical biology and surface chemistry to biomolecular-array technologies. He later received an EPSRC Life Science Interface research fellowship in 2008 where he worked with Chad A. Mirkin at the International Institute for Nanotechnology in Northwestern University before returning back to the University of Manchester as a lecturer in 2011. He was later promoted to the position of senior lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at The University of Manchester. Wong's research in general is based on industrial biotechnology and materials chemistry, specifically on nanofabrication and biocatalysis. = Notable work = In 2008, Wong took part in a research with Jason Micklefield where they developed a new method to manufacture protein microarrays at a much faster and efficient rate than what has been previously published. The research also showed that the new technique was protein friendly, with the critical tag fused to the protein being smaller thus reducing requirements of alternative techniques such as protein capture. This also showed that this reduced the likely hood of disruption to the protein’s folding. In 2015, Wong also demonstrated the use of the substrate set benzaldehyde and furan in a Paternò–Büchi reaction. In 2017, Wong also showed how the enzyme silicatein from the sponge Suberites domuncula can hydrolyze a variety of organosiloxanes and form others without chlorosilanes, and further demonstrated the enzymes ability to carry out this task in organic solvents at relatively high temperatures, sometimes with yields between 80 and 90%. Organosiloxanes are used in a wide variety of lubricants and coatings, and chemists use the molecules as protecting groups in organic synthesis and the previous known technique of forming Si-O bonds from chlorosilanes require a lot of energy to make and can lead to acidic waste. The material is also not recyclable as there is no way to break down these bonds in polymeric organosiloxanes. In 2018, Wong and his research team developed a new sophisticated hydrogel system (using polyacrylamide polymers with azobenzene cross linker) with reversibly tuneable physical stiffness, controlled by either near-UV or blue light exposure which allow the control of stiffening of a cell's external environment via irradiating the hydrogel with specific wavelengths of light. The research showed that the use of polyacrylamide polymers with azobenzene cross linker's in this system also negated the need for cell behaviour- altering treatments.

The genus contains a single species, Beg tse, known from a partial skull and very fragmentary postcrania. Beg represents the most basal neoceratopsian currently known.  Discovery and naming  The holotype, IGM 100/3652, was discovered in 2015 near the town of Tsogt-Ovoo in the Ömnögovi Province of Mongolia. Described from the Ulaanoosh Formation, the specimen is dated to 113 to 94 million years ago, at the boundary of the Lower and Upper Cretaceous. Beg is named after Beg-tse, a Himalayan deity who is the god of war in Mongolian culture. The deity is often depicted with a rugose face and/or body, similar to the appearance of the preserved skull of the dinosaur.  Description  Skull from behind Based on the size of the skull, about long, Beg was most likely a medium-sized basal ceratopsian, similar in size to Yinlong and Liaoceratops. It shows transitional features between basal ceratopsians and other neoceratopsians because it is phylogenetically intermediate between them. Other fossil material, though fragmentary, includes a rib, partial left scapula, partial right ischium, and many bone fragments that cannot be identified.  Paleoecology  Beg is known from the Ulaanoosh Formation of southern Mongolia. Sauropods, turtles and dinosaur eggs assigned to Parafaveoloolithus sp. are also known from the formation.

For the following two decades, the Romanian state would apply a policy of colonization in the southern part. The population exchange between Bulgaria and Romania was a population exchange carried out in 1940 after the transfer of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria by Romania. It involved 103,711 Romanians and Aromanians living in Southern Dobruja and 62,278 Bulgarians from Northern Dobruja. After this operation, the application of a population exchange in other cases such as Transylvania was considered. History In 1913, the Kingdom of Romania conquered Southern Dobruja after the Bulgarian defeat in the Second Balkan War. The country had already acquired Northern Dobruja in 1878. This sparked revisionalist feelings in Bulgaria. Following the occupation of the Romanian regions of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina by the Soviet Union in June 1940, Romania searched for protection in the Axis powers, but it was demanded to first resolve its territorial disputes with its neighbors. Thus, on 30 August, Romania ceded Northern Transylvania to Hungary in the Second Vienna Award, while at the Treaty of Craiova of 7 September, Romania returned Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. Unlike Northern Transylvania, Southern Dobruja was seen as much less important by Romanian nationalists. Those ethnic Romanians who remained in Northern Transylvania were encouraged to remain there, and some nationalists promised to reconquer the region. On the other hand, in Southern Dobruja, the Romanian authorities insisted on carrying out a population exchange with Bulgaria. A total of 103,711 Romanians living in the region were transferred to Romania, while 62,278 Bulgarians native to Northern Dobruja were evacuated to Bulgaria. The Aromanian settlers, most of whom were native to Greece, were counted as Romanians and therefore left the zone as well. The population exchange was carried out in compliance with the international laws of the time. Romania also proposed to exchange the rest of their respective minorities still residing outside Dobruja in the two countries, but Bulgaria did not approve this. After the population exchange, in Romania, out of the 21,897 mostly peasant families that arrived, 11,678 were settled in Northern Dobruja, while the rest were settled in groups all over the country where land was available for them. Aftermath The population exchange, perceived by some as a success, gave the idea more popularity in Romania. In fact, some persons like Sabin Manuilă planned to carry out another one between Hungary and Romania to solve the Transylvanian dispute, but this never happened.

It was Gilbert's 15th novel and falls into the category of police procedurals, although it is undoubtedly more hard- boiled in tone than the usual procedurals. Its protagonist is a new character from Gilbert, the tough Inspector Bill Mercer, and a secondary character, Chief Superintendent Morrissey, also makes his first appearance. Gilbert, who created many series characters over his long career, later used both of them in various short stories. Plot Three separate plot elements eventually come together in Body of a Girl. First, New Scotland Yard and high government officials are concerned about an alarming rise in organized gangster activities, particularly from the Crows, and, under the command of Chief Superintendent Morrissey, determine ways to combat it. One step, apparently related to this, involves promoting Inspector Bill Mercer to Chief Inspector and posting him to the small city of Stoneferry on Thames, an upriver station of Q Division of the Metropolitan Police. (Q Division, it will be recalled, was the division in which Gilbert's better-known Inspector Patrick Petrella spent most of his career.) Not long after arriving in Stoneferry, the tough, scar-faced, and rather enigmatic Mercer becomes a drinking companion of John Bull, the one-armed but extremely rugged proprietor of the town's leading garage; somewhat to the puzzlement of his fellow policemen, Mercer takes a peculiar interest in the operations of the garage and in the history of how it came to have its predominant position on the High Street. The third component also shows up soon after Mercer's arrival: the discovery on a small island in the Thames of the body of a young woman; she has been completely buried and been there long enough now that only her clothes and bones remain. Mercer, as a divisional detective, takes charge of the investigation, supervising the local uniformed branch. Because of a handbag found buried nearby, it becomes nearly certain that the remains are those of Sweetie Sowthistle, a teenage girl who was a well-known and very well-liked local prostitute and who had suddenly vanished two years earlier. An inquest is called to formally identity the remains but, to the chagrin of the local police (and the apparent indifference of Mercer), evidence is unexpectedly introduced to indicate that the victim was a somewhat older woman who could not have been the missing Sweetie. A second young woman, the clerk from a local solicitor's office, who also apparently left Stoneferry two years earlier is soon brought into the picture but it proves curiously elusive to determine her actual status: Were those her bones in the sand or had she simply moved to London? While Mercer and his fellow policemen attempt to solve this riddle, Mercer's interest in John Bull's garage continues to grow and, in a sudden change in the narrative flow, the story becomes less of a procedural and more of a study in violence as it pivots back to Superintendent Morrissey and his determination to smash the criminal gang the Crows. In a final, carefully planned ambush of the Crows with a deadly shoot-out in London, Mercer plays a key role, bringing him face to face for a final time with John Bull, the one-armed garage proprietor. And then, on the final page, almost as an anti-climax, we learn the apparent story behind the disappearances of the two Stoneferry girls two years before. As one of Gilbert's editors said after his death in 2006, \\"He's not a hard-boiled writer in the classic sense, but there is a hard edge to him, a feeling within his work that not all of society is rational, that virtue is not always rewarded.\\".Douglas Greene of Crippen & Landrau, quoted in The New York Times, 15 February 2006 Such is the case here.

It concerned the jurisdiction over and administration of civil affairs in Dutch East Indies territory liberated by an Allied expeditionary force during WWII. Background The Constitution of the Netherlands of 1922 had abolished any juridical distinction between the European territories of the Dutch Empire and the former “overseas” or “colonial” territories. Constitutionally, therefore, the Kingdom of the Netherlands was an integral whole consisting of four administrative areas: *The Netherlands *Suriname *Territory of Curaçao *Dutch East Indieshttps://www.tweedekamer.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/hoogers_karapetian_het_koninkrijk_tegen_het_licht_3_mei_definitief.pdf Under normal conditions, the Crown was charged by the Constitution of the Netherlands with the “supreme administration” over the Dutch East Indies, while the “general administration” of the East Indies was entrusted to the Governor General. Since the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, both the supreme administration and the general administration of Indies affairs (Both Dutch and West Indies) rests with the Dutch government-in-exile acting with the advice of various agencies such as; *Ministry for Overseas Territories, *Ministry for the Coordination of Warfare of the Kingdom *Netherlands Indies Commission for Australia and New Zealand (NINDICOM) Agreements “We have let you down after you went to war for us. It is my duty to restore you to Indonesia ”, General MacArthur declared a month after the capitulation of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in Java to Lieutenant Governor General of the Dutch East Indies Huib van Mook. This happened during an interview in Melbourne, April 4, 1942.https://75jaarvrij.nl/cms/view/57991930/indie-06-2020-macarthur-en-de- herovering-van-nederlands-indie The first agreement for postwar policy planning in regard to Japan and areas under Japanese control, between the United States and the Netherlands, were signed at London, May 16, 1944. It was agreed that the Allied forces in the liberated areas would be utilised for NICA's administrative tasks, but due to political conflicts with the American State Department - which wanted the Netherlands to commit to a date for the colony's independence or full autonomy according to the Atlantic Charter, signed by the Dutch government - it took until 10 December 1944 for the parties (Hubertus van Mook and Douglas MacArthur) to sign the Van Mook- MacArthur Civil Affairs Agreement. Its key provision was that areas recaptured by Allied troops would revert to Dutch rule via the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA).https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1944v05/d1186 The first NICA detachments landed at Hollandia in New Guinea, April 1944. Their commander was Colonel C. Giebel, Staff Officer NICA (SONICA). The CONICA was authorised to execute emergency measures and to carry out the orders of the Military Authority. By the time Japan surrendered, NICA units and 1st Infantry Battalion (KNIL) had landed in New Guinea (Hollandia, Biak, Numfur and Manokwari), the Moluccas (Morotai) and Borneo (Tarakan and Balikpapan).https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79036227.pdf On August 15, 1945, it was announced that the entire Dutch East Indies would be transferred from the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) to the South East Asia Command (SEAC). The liberation of Sumatra, Java, Bali and Lombok was now the responsibility of the British. The Australian troops were assigned to the occupation of Borneo, Celebes, the Moluccas and the other islands in the eastern East Indies.

It is named after Margaret Heckler, who was Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services from 1983 to 1985. The Heckler Report investigated racial and ethnic disparities in health in the United States. History In 1977, the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools was formed by Louis Wade Sullivan, Ralph Cazort, Anthony Rachal, and Walter Bowie. In the early 1980s, they commissioned a study by Ruth Hanft which was published as \\"Blacks and the Health Professions in the 1980s: A National Crisis and A Time for Action\\". In March 1983, members of the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools met with Margaret Heckler, who was Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Heckler was said to be disturbed by the \\"Blacks and the Health Professions...\\" documentation of life expectancy disparities, calling it an \\"affront to our ideals and to the genius of American medicine\\". A month later, Heckler contacted them to let them know that she had commissioned a taskforce to be led by Thomas E. Malone and Katrina Johnson. The Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health was published in August 1985. Findings The Heckler Report found that in the US, 60,000 deaths occurred each year due health disparities. It outlined the six causes of death that accounted for more than 80% of mortality among ethnic and racial minorities. The report included recommendations to reduce these health disparities, as well as to collect data of a higher quality for Hispanics, Asian Americans, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. Legacy The Heckler Report was the first effort by the US government to investigate health inequality among racial and ethnic minorities. It has been called a \\"landmark\\", \\"groundbreaking\\", and \\"a transformative, driving force for change\\". It has served as the \\"anchor\\" of federal efforts to reduce and eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities. It directly led to the creation of the Office of Minority Health in 1986. Offices of minority health were additionally established in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as a result of the report.

Made on a budget of MVR 2,000,000 the directors were provided with a 45 days timeline to complete their respective segment. In 2016, a controversy arises when the producer criticizes the director Ravee Farooq and Abdul Faththaah for \\"failing\\" to complete their segments during the stipulated time period. Unable to \\"contact and mutually agree\\" on an extended deadline, producer took over the project from Farooq and continued from where he left; post-production work only. Farooq replied to the statement of Fuad and considered his act as a \\"personal vendetta\\" against him. According to Faththaah, the laptop in which he stored the project data was lost and had to re-work on his segment from the provided raw files which costed him an unforeseen delay. Soundtrack Release The film was initially scheduled to be released theatrically in 2013. However, the producer having issues in appointing a party for the marketing of the film, the project was delayed indefinitely until Baiskoafu acquired the rights to digitally stream the film.

Odekunle is a British neurobiologist and antibody engineer. Her research focuses on identifying and removing risks from antibodies to improve their development into medications. She also promotes the visibility of diverse professionals in STEM.  Early life and education  Odekunle was born the youngest of her siblings and raised in the United Kingdom by Nigerian parents who had emigrated to the UK. She was inspired by her teachers while growing up and by books on animals and the human body, encouraging her interest in science from a young age. After initially considering a career in medicine, she earned both the B.S. in biochemistry and Ph.D. in neurobiology from Queen Mary University of London. Her doctoral work focused on neuropeptide systems in starfish. She chose to work on starfish because of little-understood abilities such as regeneration. After having worked with mice and rats as an undergraduate, she was also encouraged by the fact that starfish do not bite. She took a year off between degree programs and received full funding for her doctoral work from the Society for Experimental Biology.  Career  Odekunle's goal in academia was not to remain there as a professor, but rather to \\"explore a specific scientific area in great depth and contribute to the scientific field\\" and eventually to apply her scientific skills to therapeutics. As an antibody engineer, she works to clone antibodies from B cells and develop them as potential treatments for specific disease targets such as cancers, viral infections, and bacterial infections. Because of the limitations placed on what scientists in her position in the pharmaceutical industry can say about their work, Odekunle had to develop a voice within the scientific community apart from speaking about things that are confidential. This led her to speaking out on racism in academia and science and to helping to encourage and make more visible those in science who are underrepresented. This she does on various social media platforms. Some of her content, such as her episode on Henrietta Lacks on her YouTube channel has been shared with students at early as well as advanced levels of education.

Early years Walther von Corswant was born in 1886, the son of an estate owner. After attending elementary and high school and a year in the military, he attended six semesters between 1904 and 1907 at the Deutsche Kolonialschule in Witzenhausen that trained people in agriculture for resettlement in Germany’s overseas colonies. He then worked as a planter in Cameroon and New Guinea. Due to a stomach illness, Corswant left the tropics and returned to Germany. After regaining his health, he studied for a semester at the agricultural college in Jena. Following a one-year unpaid internship in agriculture, Corswant took over his parents' estate, of Kuntzow in the Greifswald district of Pomerania. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Corswant enlisted in the army as a member of the 2nd Guards Infantry Regiment but soon was medically discharged due to a recurrence of his stomach ailment. He returned to agricultural work. Nazi Party career In 1923 he joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) but when it was outawed following the Beer Hall Putsch, he associated with the German Völkisch Freedom Party. After the ban on the Nazis was lifted, Corswant rejoined the Party on 10 June 1925 (membership number 7,342). He was made Bezirksleiter (District Leader) in Vorpommern (Western Pomerania). By 1927, Adolf Hitler was replacing several early Party leaders whom he considered to be too socialistic or not to have the necessary attributes to be effective administrators. Consequently, on 1 May 1927 Corswant was appointed Deputy to Gauleiter Theodor Vahlen of Pomerania who was placed on indefinite leave, and von Corswant effectively was left in charge. On 21 August, Vahlen was formally relieved of his position and Corswant officially became Gauleiter. In November 1929, Corswant became the parliamentary group leader of the NSDAP bloc in the Provincial Landtag of the Province of Pomerania. At the same time he was also a member of the Provincial Committee. Also in 1929, he founded a weekly Nazi newspaper, Die Diktatur. In the election of September 1930, Corswant was elected to the Reichstag for electoral constituency 6 (Pomerania) and remained a member of the German parliament until his death. Corswant remained Gauleiter of Pomerania until 1 April 1931 when he was succeeded by Wilhelm Karpenstein. He then took up a position in the Economic Policy Department of the Party central leadership (Reichsleitung) in Munich. Until the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Corswant acted as the department's representative to the Weimar Republic. On 1 October 1935, Corswant became a member of the Reich Farmers’ Council (Reichsbauernrat) serving until April 1941, when he became a member of the Reich Advisory Council for Food and Agriculture. Also in 1935, Corswant was made a member of the Prussian Provincial Council for Pomerania, and on 27 February 1936 he was appointed District Administrator of the Greifswald Landkreis (District). He retained both of these positions until his death. On 23 April 1936, Corswant was named to the Supreme Court of Honor and Discipline of the German Labor Front (DAF). Corswant died on 12 December 1942 and was buried in the chapel of the family’s Kuntzow estate.

British Columbia [2020 BCSC 1310] is a high- profile, multi-year Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC) case against the province of British Columbia and its Medical Services Commission, launched in 2006 by \\"private health-care advocate\\", Brian Day, who runs the Vancouver, British Columbia-based private clinic that challenged the constitutionality of two provisions of British Columbia's Medicare Protection Act under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The September 10, 2020 decision for the four-year trial—which began in 2016—was handed down by Justice John J. Steeves of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC). In his 880-page decision, Justice Steeves dismissed both the charter claims. Background Brian Day, A \\"private health-care advocate\\", who founded and serves as the medical director of the private clinic Cambie Surgery Centre and Specialist Referral Clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia, was the spokesman for the high-profile case, sometimes called 'The Day Case'. The plaintiffs' claim The plaintiffs, which included Cambie Surgeries Corporation, Chris Chiavatti, Mandy Martens, Krystiana Corrado, Walid Khalfallah by his litigation guardian Debbie Waitkus, and Specialist Referral Clinic (Vancouver) Inc., claimed that sections 14, 17, 18 and 45 of the British Columbia's Medicare Protection Act (MPA) were in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms the \\"right to life, liberty and security of the person\\" and Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, equality rights. Specifically, Day argued that the MPA injunction that prohibits patients from accessing private \\"diagnostic and surgical services\\" if public health services fail to provide service within a \\"timely fashion\\", results in patients suffering \\"prolonged pain and disability, serious psychological harm or deterioration and irreparable harm.\\" Day had argued that patients have a constitutional right under the under the Charter to access private surgery and diagnostic tests. Under B.C.'s Medicare Protection Act doctors and other care providers are prohibited from \\"charging patients directly for services that are insured through the public system\\" through \\"user fees or extra billing\\". This is a protection to ensure unimpeded \\"reasonable access\\"—regardless of income—to \\"universal\\" medical services care. The plaintiffs referred to the 2005 Supreme Court of Canada case Chaoulli v Quebec (AG)—a similar case in the province of Québec. Defendants and Intervenors Defendants included Attorney General of British Columbia and a Coalition of Intervenors who oppose the plaintiffs' claim. The Patient Intervenors included four \\"ordinary British Columbians\\" who \\"claim to have experienced harm while being treated by physicians engaging in dual practice and extra billing.\\" The Coalition Intervenors represent four individuals and two organizations, Canadian Doctors for Medicare and the British Columbia Friends of Medicare Society, also known as the BC Health Coalition. The intervenors include medical doctors, Duncan Etches and Robert Woollard and two low income patients who use British Columbia's public health care system. Trial proceedings The trial which took place over a four-year period, from 2016 to 2020, included over a hundred witnesses. Decision In his 880-page decision, which he handed down on September 10, 2020, Justice John J. Steeves, of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC), who presided over the trial, found that the \\"impugned provisions do not deprive the right to life or liberty of the patient plaintiffs or similarly situated individuals.\\" Justice Steeves also found that there was a \\"rational connection between the effects of the impugned provisions and the objectives of preserving...the universal health care system and ensuring access to necessary medical services is based on need and not the ability to pay.\\" Appeals It is expected that the case will be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Prior to which, it will first need to be appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Media response According to a 2014 article in The Tyee, the case has been described as one of the most significant challenges in Canada's legal history. Business Wire called the ruling a \\"victory for public health care in Canada\\". See also *Chaoulli v Quebec (AG) References External links * *2010 BCSC 396 Cambie Surgeries Corp. v.

The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Portuguese, putting an end to Castilian ambitions to take over the Portuguese throne. Azulejo tile image of Brites de Almeida killing Castilian soldiers The legend Brites de Almeida is said to have been born in Faro in 1350, to poor parents. According to the legend she had six fingers on each hand. After both of her parents died, she sold her few possessions and began to travel. There are many stories about her life after she left home in her twenties. One says that she became a muleteer and that she killed a suitor in a fight. Another that she was on a boat attacked by Algerian pirates who sold her as a slave to the Imperial Harem in Algiers, from which she escaped. It is also said that she travelled in Portugal disguised as a man. She ended up settling in Aljubarrota, where she became a bakery owner and married a local farmer. Her bread was supposed to be the best in the country. After their defeat in the Battle of Aljubarrota, the Castilian soldiers in flight were attacked and killed by the local inhabitants. According to the story, seven or eight of them found shelter at Brites' bakery, which was empty because she had gone out to help to kill the soldiers. On her return she found the door closed and suspected the presence of enemies. She found the men hiding in her baker's oven and killed them with a shovel. She then cooked them in the oven along with the bread. Although it is undeniable that the story was a legend, Brites de Almeida came to be celebrated by the Portuguese in their songs and traditional stories and her deeds have remained as a symbol of Portugal's independence. She was commemorated in a 1927 Portuguese postage stamp.

She studies how vegetation impacts the dynamics and pathways of streams. In 2020 Barnard was awarded a $7 million National Science Foundation grant to set up a Critical Zone Observatory at the University of Colorado Boulder.  Early life and education  Barnard earned her bachelor's degree in forestry and ecosystems at the University of Washington. After being inspired to work in environmental science, Barnard moved to Colorado State University to work toward a master's degree in forest engineering, where she worked on tree physiology with Tom Hinckley and Linda Brubaker. Barnard was first introduced to ecological methods whilst working in their research labs. After graduating, Barnard worked in environmental consulting, completing ground- and surface water sampling. She was certified as an ecologist by the Ecological Society of America in 2004. Barnard eventually joined Oregon State University as a doctoral student, where she worked under the supervision of Barbara J. Bond on a Ford Foundation fellowship. She studied the relationships between vegetation water use, hydrology and the climate. As a graduate student, Barnard was selected to take part in the national Minorities Striving and Pursuing Higher Degrees of Success in Earth System Science (MS PHDs) programme, which supported her to attend the American Geophysical Union annual conference and complete work experience at NASA. In 2009 Barnard was made an National Science Foundation Minority Post-doctoral Fellow, allowing her to join the University of Wyoming to study water loss from forest vegetation.  Research and career  Barnard looks to understand how vegetation impacts water flow and how water flow influences vegetation function in mountainous terrain. She has studied the fairy circles of Namibia using a combination of experimental investigations and computational modelling. In 2017 she visited Namibia with an all-women research team, conducting a series of experiments in the Namib desert to better understand their origin. As part of this work, Barnard and co-workers showed that grazing animals play an important role in maintaining the circles. She has investigated the impact of climate change on coniferous forests by studying the exchange of carbon dioxide between forests and the atmosphere. At Colorado, Barnard is involved with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) education and outreach program, which looks to strengthen environmental literacy and support the next generation of scientific researchers in training for careers in sustainability. In 2020 Barnard was awarded a $7 million National Science Foundation grant to establish the University of Colorado Boulder Critical Zone Observatory. The observatory looks to understand how vegetation, water and rocks change in the fire- and drought-prone ecosystems of the West Coast of the United States. As part of this effort, Barnard developed low cost, low power, easy to assemble devices capable of measuring photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). A network of so-called PARduinos can be assembled across ground, providing constant measurements of PAR and allowing for Barnard and co-workers to model tree growth.

He was active in establishing the intendancy in Congo Free State. Early years (1850–1884) Camille Théodore Joseph Van den Plas was born in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Brussels, Belgium on 5 January 1850. His parents were Pierre Joseph Van den Plas, a teacher at the Brussels Athénée, and Anne-Marie Holzemer. He studied at the Middle School of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, and learned to speak and write French, Flemish, English and German. In 1865 he enlisted as a volunteer with the 8th Line Regiment. He was appointed sergeant in 1867 and sergeant major on 21 December 1868. On 31 December 1874 he left the army and then held several jobs as an accountant. First term in the Congo (1884–1887) On 1 April 1884 Van den Plas was hired an agent by the International Association of the Congo. He left Liverpool on the Roquette on 17 April 1884, bound for the Congo. He spent several months at Vivi, then on 31 July 1884 was appointed first commercial agent in Léopoldville. On 11 November 1884 Guillaume Casman left for Équateur in an expedition with three steamers: the Royal, A.I.A. and En Avant. The members included Charles Liebrechts and Van den Plas. They arrived at Equateur Station on 12 December 1884, where Alphonse van Gèle handed over command to Casman in a ceremony before the native chiefs. Van Gèle then left for a visit to the Stanley Falls accompanied by Van den Plas and the Swedish lieutenant Edde Gleerup. The mission reached the Falls on 26 January 1885, where they found a very precarious situation due to the actions of the Zanzibar Arab trader Tippu Tip. They managed to get Tuppu Tip to agree not to interfere with the Belgians, but he did not keep this promise. Van Gèle charged Van den Plas with establishing an accounting service in the Upper Congo. On 1 July 1885 Van den Plas was appointed head of Equateur station. He replaced Casman, and in December 1885 was replaced by Edward James Glave. On 28 December 1885 he was appointed commercial agent among the Bangalas. He was then responsible for leading a first contingent of 84 Bangala soldiers, with 11 women to Boma. He was responsible for training them under the orders of Lieutenant Léon Roget. In December 1886, as assistant to Lieutenant Henri Avaert, he took part in the expedition to Manyanga and was responsible for the evacuation of Vivi. He returned to Boma on 14 January 1887, embarked at Banana on 17 January 1887 and reached Belgium on 15 February 1887 at the end of his term of service. Subsequent terms (1887–1901) Van den Plas signed a new three-year engagement and left Belgium of 21 August 1887, reaching Boma on 28 September 1887. He started work as an administrative agent of the Congo Free State. On 9 January 1888 he was named director of the general supply depot in Boma, and on 28 September 1888 was appointed commander of Boma station. On 27 October 1888 he was promoted to district commissioner 2nd class. On 10 June 1890 he was appointed deputy secretary general. After completing his term, he returned to Belgium on 19 September 1890. On 18 March 1891 Van den Plas was appointed intendant. He arrived in Boma on 15 April 1891, where he organized and led the intendancy until leaving from Banana on 24 September 1893. He signed up for another three-year engagement, reached Boma on 30 July 1894 and resumed his duties on 1 August 1894. He carried out multiple audits and inspections during this term. Governor General Théophile Wahis took him as deputy on his inspection tour to Kasongo. Van den Plas returned to Boma on 25 February 1897 and left for Belgium on 5 April 1897. He returned on a special mission in the Congo from 2 July 1898 to 26 June 1899. He was sent on another special mission, arrived in Boma on 21 September 1901, but fell sick and suffered from severe ophthalmia.

Stemming from a six plane detachment assigned to Venice's defense on 15 August 1915, after its foundation in June 1916, Escadrille Spa. 561 would defend Venice until 1 January 1918. Detached then to support the French X Armee during its sojourn in Italy, the squadron remained on the peninsula after the X Armee had returned to France. By war's end, Escadrille Spa.561 was credited with destroying 12 enemy aircraft and four observation balloons. History Escadrille Spa.561 stemmed from an aviation detachment posted at Mestre, Italy on 15 August 1915 for the defense of Venice. Its original inventory was six aircraft. In December 1915, the unit relocated to Lido; moving nearer Venice made it easier to defend it. In June 1916, the squadron's name was dubbed Escadrille N.92; the unit's designation denotes a Nieuport airplane inventory. Then, for no discernible reason, it was redesignated as Escadrille N.392.Over the Front: The Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914–1918, p. 109 By the beginning of 1917, the escadrille had 18 airplanes on hand. On 1 July 1917, the squadron was renumbered Escadrille N.561. On 1 January 1918, the squadron was attached to X Armee for their Italian operations. After X Armee returned to France, Escadrille N.561 remained in Italy, though at reduced strength. In April 1918, it had 10 Nieuports. It can be inferred that by some date after April 1918, the squadron had re-equipped with SPADs, as it ended the war as Escadrille Spa.561. Whatever the unit's name or aircraft, by war's' end it was credited with destruction of 12 enemy aircraft, as well as four observation balloons shot down.

The plains are from sediments on the floor of Lake Missoula during the glacial epoch. The last part is bottom lands, created by recent erosion of the old lake plain. =Mountain reach= The mountainous or hill country, reaches from the headwaters above U.S. 2 to north of Lone Pine. The river is surrounded by hills rather than mountains. The hills and mountains on the east side of the valley are nearly treeless, but those on the west side apparently receive more rain and snow, for they support a forest of large trees. The sides of the mountains are marked with horizontal lines that show the levels at which the water stood when Lake Missoula extended over this region. The Little Bitterroot begins at pass above Marion on U.S. 2 where Forest Road (FR) 5344 and FR 538 or Griffin Creek Road. From this pass at above sea level (asl), the basin collects into Little Bitterroot Lake, asl. The south end of the lake drains into the Little Bitterroot River, flowing southward. For a few miles, the river shares its valley with U.S. 2. Here, Sickler Creek joins the Little Bitterroot, draining the basin of Lake Rogers to the east. Highway 2 continues west over a shallow pass into the McGregor Lake valley and the Little Bitterroot continues south, entering a narrow canyon and Hidden Lakes. Before reaching Hidden Lake, the river drops over a rapidly losing in elevation, reaching the lake which stands at asl. Through the Hidden Lake area, the canyons are flat bottom, evidence of glacial ice scouring this area. As the canyon opens into a wide flat bottom valley, Tamarack Creek enters from the west, just before reaching Hubbart Reservoir.

Its name is derived from the Greek word acanthos meaning \\"spine\\" and the Greek suffix for spine, -rhachis. This is due to the spine- like dermal denticles and their subsidiary spines, which coated the exterior of the animal. The authors who erected this genus suggested the common name \\"The Spiny Spined Shark.\\" It is closely related to Listracanthus. It differs from it in the size, structure, and distribution of dermal spines. It is currently monotypic, containing only the species A. spinatus. This shark is thus far only described from the British Isles. Acanthorhachis was first described from the Westphalian-aged lower coal measures of Yorkshire, England.

It is a fully featured recreation of the 2003 game Eve Online, developed for mobile operating systems. Eve Echoes includes a number of in-game professions and activities, such as mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player), in which a player can participate. The game is free to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play and is free to play. It also features paid subscriptions and items that can be purchased for real currency. The game was launched worldwide on August 13, 2020 and by August 25 the player population had surpassed 1 million.  Gameplay  At the start of a game players either select a previously created character or create a new one. Each Eve Echoes account allows for up to three characters. When a player creates a new character, they start by choosing one of the four playable races – Amarr, Gallente, Minmatar, or Caldari. Each race is further divided into bloodlines that give characters different pre-defined appearances from which players can choose. The races, bloodlines and appearances do not have any effects on the gameplay and are merely cosmetic. Eve Echoes is functionally a single-universe game, in that all players play on the same server, unlike many other MMOs where numerous copies of the game exist on regional servers. = Universe = The character that players play as is called a clone. Gameplay in Eve Echoes is in an environment of more than 8000 solar systems, taking place in 23341 C.E. Solar systems may contain planets that can be mined, stations at which players can dock to perform various trade and industry functions, asteroid fields or belts that can be mined, stargates allowing movement between solar systems, and anomalies at which players encounter hostile NPC ships. Stations can also be designated as a \\"home base\\" for a clone, in which case if the clone is destroyed during a battle a new clone will be generated at the home base. Solar systems are classified on a System Security scale from -1.0 to 1.0, which determines the response from the NPC law enforcement units called the Consolidated Co-operation and Relations Command (CONCORD). In systems with security levels of 0.5 - 1.0, classified as \\"high security\\" (\\"high sec\\"), any unauthorized/unprovoked attack by a player on another player anywhere in the system will result in the appearance of law enforcement. The CONCORD law enforcement will attack and destroy the aggressor and are designed to always to win any confrontation. However, as the system is reactive, not preventative, player's ships can be destroyed by other players before the CONCORD response can be initiated. In addition, unattended mining containers launched from planets cannot be stolen (\\"looted\\") by other players in \\"high sec\\". In \\"low security\\" (\\"low sec\\") systems (0.1-0.4) CONCORD monitors unprovoked attacks but does not destroy aggressors unless they are within range of sentry guns found in various parts of the system. Unprovoked attacks will temporarily flag the aggressor, allowing other players to attack the offending player without repercussion. Looting of unattended mining containers in low sec systems results in a similar temporary flag being applied to the player. Systems with -1.0 to 0.0 security rating (known as \\"no security\\", \\"null sec\\" or \\"zero space\\") feature no CONCORD security response. Such systems may be controlled by player alliances, who may enforce their own set of regulations. = Travel = The majority of gameplay involves flying around in a space ship. Players can dock these ships at stations where they are safe from attack. At these stations the ships can be repaired, ship components can be purchased and fitted to the ship, items mined or looted can be stored, and the regional market is available for purchases and sales. Depending on the play-style of the player and their intentions, flying around in the game can be for several different reasons, including combat (PvP and PvE), asteroid mining, planet mining, and even goods delivery. There are three forms of travel, namely stargate jumps, warping and approach speed. Within star systems and at distances of less than 150 km approach speed movement is used. This is the rate of travel used to approach stations for docking, to approach asteroids for mining or mineral crates for recovery, and is also used during combat. For travel within systems at distances in excess of 150 km, a warp drive is used and all ships have such a drive. The player issues a command to warp to an object and an automated system aligns the ship towards the object and the ship then enters warp. During warp certain fittings on the ship, such as additional shielding, cannot be activated but the ship also cannot be locked onto for attack. The ship's warp drive can be deactivated temporarily by warp disruptor weapons, which can be use by an opponent to prevent a ship from fleeing during combat. When travelling between solar systems players use stargates. Each stargate is linked to another stargate in the destination system forming a network through which players can travel. = Combat = Combat takes place in space in real time at sub-light speeds of around 100 m/s up to more than 1000 m/s, depending on the type of ship and its configuration. Combat involves locking on to a selected target and allowing automated systems to fire the ships weapons. The results of the firing depend on factors such as range, velocity of the target, type of weapon, type of shielding or armor on the target, and weapon tracking systems and includes a degree of randomness. Some characters operate as mercenaries or pirates, paid to attack or defend other profitable enterprises such as asteroid mining. = Economy = The in- game economy of \\"Eve Echoes\\" is a player driven, open economy in which player characters and NPC merchants buy and sell most items including ships, modules, trade goods, blueprints and other items. Players can gather raw materials, by planetary mining, asteroid mining and salvaging from NPC ships after battles, to reverse engineer blueprints and manufacture items based on them or to sell on the markets. The in-game currency is ISK (Interstellar Kredits) and the value of the ISK and the prices for materials and goods are not fixed within the game but are determined by supply and demand economics. As a result, although the game provides an estimated market price for any item, the actual price that the player might pay could be significantly different. The economy is balanced by the automatic introduction of extra materials in underpopulated areas, which is an attempt to encourage players to spread out throughout the Eve universe. However, Alpha clones are able to buy goods from any station but are only able to sell goods at regional centres, whereas Omega clones are able to buy and sell at any centre. This means that regional centres and the adjacent star systems tend to be more congested than other parts of the Eve universe. The other form of in-game currency is Plex (Pilot Life Extension) which is used to purchase the monthly subscriptions to play Eve Echoes as an Omega clone. Some players within Eve Echoes chose to not engage in battles but rather trade goods or services. Such trading includes asteroid mining, planetary mining, refining and goods delivery. In both asteroid mining and planetary mining the goods can be sold on the in-game market. The ore that is obtained by mining asteroid can be refined into minerals. This is can be done by the player that mined the ore, or the ore can be refined for a fee by a player with a higher efficiency in refining. The goods obtained from planetary mining are different to those obtained from asteroid mining and there are ships dedicated to the transportation of asteroid ores and planetary minerals. Generally these goods are used to manufacture ships and fittings for the ships. Goods delivery involves the transportation of goods bought by other players from the station at which they bought the goods to the destination chosen by them. A third class of industrial ships is dedicated to the transportation of these goods. The recovered wreckage of ships and their fittings can also be processed into yet another class of trade goods. The wreckage and the processed materials from them are used in reverse engineering attempts in which the player attempt to produce a blue print from the salvage materials.  Advancement in the game  Player characters in Eve Echoes advance continuously by training skills, a passive process that occurs in real world time even when the player is not logged in. There is a skills training queue in which skills can be queued up to the point at which 24 hours or more of training has been scheduled. If no training is scheduled the character earns skill points, at a rate determined by the Alpha or Omega status of the character and the level of \\"Cognitive Neuroscience\\" that the character has been trained to. These two factors also affect the rate at which the character acquires skills.  Ships  There are more than 100 ships to pilot in Eve Echoes. The ships are separated into several categories based on various criteria. For example, combat ships are categorised based on size as \\"Frigate\\", \\"Destroyer\\", \\"Cruiser\\", \\"Battlecruiser\\" and \\"Battleship\\". Industrial ships are classified by function as transport ships, expedition frigates and mining barges. Individual factions have their own versions of some or all of these categories of ships. Ships have an associated technology level (tech level). Player characters cannot access the ships if their tech level is below that of the ship. Fittings for ships, such as weapons, armor, warpdrive, batteries, control systems, drones, etc. each have a tech level and can be fitted only to ships with the same or greater tech level by a player with the same or greater tech level. Some ships also have a class designation, such as class I, II or III. The higher the class the better the ship and higher the tech level of the ship. Ships can also have \\"Trainer\\" class, which is the lowest class of ship. These ships can also be insured for replacement in the case that they are destroyed in battle, even if the equivalent class I is not insurable. Other class designations include Navy Issue, Defender and Stealth and have specific advantages over the standard ships of the same class when used in certain situations.  Skills  Skills are abilities and knowledge that affect the game in several ways. All basic skills can be studied by any player but certain skills require prerequisites to be fulfilled such as a certain tech level or Omega status of the clone. There is one set of skills called \\"Biology\\" that cannot be learned but need to be purchased using one of the in-game currencies, called Plex. The biology skills encompass cognitive neuroscience, advanced cognitive neuroscience and expert cognitive neuroscience. Each of these skills improve the rate at which a clone learns new skills. There are two broad categories of skills: \\"Ship\\" and \\"Clone\\" = Ship skills = Ship skills affect the performance of the ship that the character is using. Ship skills have four categories, namely \\"Cruising technology\\", \\"Maintenance technology\\", \\"Electronics\\" and \\"Weapon technology\\".  Cruising technology  Included in these skills are * Spaceship Command - affects the speed and manoeuvrability of specific classes of ships * Navigation - impacts warpdrives and afterburners.  Maintenance technology  These skills include * Shield Operation - affects shield boosters * Armor Operation - affects armor boosters and repairers * Defense Upgrade - improves the shield, armor and structure of specific classes of ships.  Electronics  These skills cover ship electronics, namely: * Engineering - affects available energy to be used for offence or defence for specific classes of ships. * Electronic Systems - improves electronic warfare systems such as warp disruptors * Targeting - improves the range, resolution and number of targets that can be locked onto by the ship. * Fleet support  Weapon technology  These skills improve the operation of the different classes of weapons available for each ship, including lasers, railguns, cannons, missiles, drones and decomposers. Improvements include optimal range, range falloff, damage, rate of fire, range of control, tracking speed and accuracy and are specific to each type of weapon and the size of the weapon (small, medium or large). = Clone skills = Clone skills affect asteroid mining and planetary mining, industrial production, management, trade, manufacturing and reverse engineering and exploration. The skill categories are: * Industrial technology - improves production of ships, components and structures, and improves asteroid mining and resource processing. * Social Science - improves corporation management skills and trade and accounting skills. * Applied Science - improves speed and success rate for reverse engineering of the race and faction ships. * Natural Science - improves planetary mining skills and exploration skills. Includes the Cognitive Neuroscience skills which have to be purchased.

History Alpha Epsilon Iota was established as a medical fraternity for women on February 26, 1890 at the University of Michigan. It was thereby one of the earliest of the professional medical fraternities to serve women. It quickly expanded to a Beta chapter at the University of Chicago that same year, cementing its national intentions.Early chapters noted in the 1922 Alpha Epsilon Iota Directory, from the collection of the Medical College of Pennsylvania, accessed 10 Sept 2020. By the turn of the century two additional chapters had formed, with seven more added by 1910. Later, growth slowed for the most part, with a flurry of new groups in the 1920, but no new chapters after 1949. The fraternity dissolved as a national organization in March, 1963. Some chapters continued on as local entities. Minnesota's Epsilon chapter remained active through the 1970s at which time there was a marked expansion of female enrollment in the growing medical school there, but ΑΕΙ sold its properties in 1979, splitting then into two groups, the AEI Foundation which continues to provide scholarships, and a networking organization called Minnesota Women Physicians.As noted in the University of Minnesota Academic Health Center Archives, accessed 10 Sept 2020.

His portraits of 1980s pop musicians lead to him being named the \\"photographer of the decade\\" by The Guardian in 1989. His work is held in the permanent collections of the Arts Council, British Council, Victoria and Albert Museum and National Portrait Gallery, London. Early life Griffin was born in Birmingham on 13 April 1948. He grew up in Lye, a town in the Black Country, an area of the British Midlands, and attended Halesowen Technical School. At age 16, he began working in a factory as a trainee draughtsman. He spent the next few years working in engineering for the British Steel Corporation, first making conveyors and later manufacturing and installing pipework in nuclear power stations. After joining a local camera club, Along with contemporaries Daniel Meadows, Peter Fraser and Martin Parr,, PARC Projects, Photography and the Archive Research Centre. Griffin studied photography at Manchester School of Art, which became part of Manchester Polytechnic whilst he was there and from which he graduated in 1972. Career After college, Griffin moved to London to work as a fashion photographer but instead took a job as a corporate photographer for the London-based business magazine Management Today, and later other publications, including Accountancy Age, Computing, and Marketing. His 1974 photograph \\"Rush Hour, London Bridge\\" brought him national recognition; a print is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. By the 1980s, Griffin had become known as a corporate photography expert. His first solo show was in London in 1981. Around this same time, Griffin began working in the music industry, landing his first music gigs with Stiff Records. His work shooting businessmen translated well to many of the groups of the time who also dressed in suits and ties, such as The Jam and Elvis Costello and the Attractions. Over the next few years, he photographed such as acts as Depeche Mode, R.E.M., Iggy Pop, Ringo Starr, and Peter Gabriel. His work appeared on many album covers of the era, notably that of Depeche Mode's A Broken Frame, often cited as one of the best color photographs ever shot. The photograph also appears on the cover of Lifes 1990 edition of \\"World's Best Photographs 1980–1990\\". His work appeared in publications such as Esquire (US), Rolling Stone, Radio Times, The Sunday Times, The Sunday Telegraph, The Observer, and Car. Griffin, whose father died from lung cancer related to his factory job, drew upon the backgrounds of his photographic subjects, many of whom were workers and tradesman. This led to his developing a photographic style that has since been referred to as capitalist realism. Although the term has been used to describe other forms of art, he is credited with being the first to develop the style in photography. Griffin himself is unsure of who came up with the term. His work has been described as being influenced by Renaissance masters, Symbolism, and Surrealism, with \\"film noir\\" lighting, and he cites David Lynch as an influence. In 1989, The Guardian named Griffin \\"photographer of the decade\\". In the same year he left still photography behind to focus on TV commercials, music videos, and films. For many years, he owned a production company, where he worked as a commercial director.

No above- ground structure survives but the earthwork features remain visible of building platforms, ditch system, outer enclosure and fish ponds.

It served as the administrative centre of the manor of Harewood and as the residence of the lord of the manor. The site was abandoned in about 1366 when the Lisle family built Harewood Castle nearby, of which much of the ruined stone structure survives, also hidden in overgrown woodland. Harewood Castle itself was abandoned as a residence soon after 1600 when it was owned by Sir William Wentworth of Gawthorpe Hall. The estate of Harewood containing both ruined castles was purchased in 1738 by the Lascelles family, which built there as its seat the surviving palatial 18th-century mansion known as Harewood House, still owned by the family, which was created Earl of Harewood in 1812.

Career  He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Government from the College of William & Mary, and a Master’s degree in Islamic studies from Columbia University. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Murphy began his FBI career in 1998 and worked there for 20 years, culminating in a position responsible for the FBI’s national level counterterrorism programs. He later moved to DHS as Acting Principal Deputy for Intelligence and Analysis, and in May 2020 became Acting Under Secretary for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. He was removed from that position two months later after it was found his office had compiled dossiers of public information about journalists who were reporting on the George Floyd protests.  Whistleblower complaint  Murphy filed a whistleblower complaint in September 2020 alleging episodes of misconduct by top DHS officials. Murphy asserted that DHS secretary Chad Wolf and his deputy Ken Cuccinelli instructed him “to modify intelligence assessments to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump on the subject of ANTIFA and 'anarchist' groups” and to downplay the threat posed by white supremacists. Murphy stated he declined to comply. Murphy also claimed Wolf told him to \\"cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the US, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran.” Murphy said Wolf told him this directive came from White House national security advisor Robert O'Brien. He had also submitted prior complaints. In early 2020, he had submitted six internal complaints to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence about the way the intelligence program was addressing Russian disinformation. He had also filed two Office of the Inspector General reports about “attempted censorship of intelligence analysis.” Days before his September 2020 complaint, ABC News reported that DHS had withheld the July release of an intelligence bulletin to law enforcement that warned of Russian efforts to promote “allegations about the poor mental health” of Joe Biden. DHS chief of staff John Gountanis halted the release pending review by secretary Wolf. The bulletin stated that analysts had “high confidence” of the Russian efforts, which were similar to efforts by Trump and his campaign to depict Biden as mentally unfit. A DHS spokesperson said the bulletin was “delayed” because it did not meet the department’s standards. The bulletin had not been released as of the date of the ABC News report. Murphy asserted in his complaint that Wolf told him “the intelligence notification should be ‘held’ because it ‘made the President look bad.’” DHS flatly denied the allegations.They said they expect that any internal investigation by the DHS inspector general will reveal no retaliatory action against Murphy.

The number of new > cases continues to accelerate upwards and is exceeding the ability of > testing and case investigation to control the spread of illness. Contact > tracing capacity is significantly strained.  Government responses  The first person in the county testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus received confirmed test results on March 30, 2020. Out of Wisconsin's 72 counties, 44 already had confirmed cases as of that date, and on March 31, Door County was added to the Coronavirus disease 2019 map on the state Department of Public Services website, along with three other Wisconsin counties which also reported confirmed cases of the disease for the first time. Prior to this, a local politician had been infected during a vacation elsewhere and returned infected on March 13, although it was unknown at the time. Prior to the first confirmed case, hundreds of vehicles with out-of- state license plates were seen across multiple communities, even though the shops were still boarded up for the winter. The president of the county visitor bureau complained, \\"It seems like everybody thinks this is the hiding place and they all want to come here.\\" As the county under ordinary circumstances only has capacity to support twenty-five hospital patients (including four intensive care beds), the county government along with multiple community governments advised seasonal residents not to come to the county yet, or if they do anyway, to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. The mayor of Sturgeon Bay advised, \\"There's nothing to do, so you're probably better off staying at home because you’re not going to find any entertainment here.\\" Postal address change records indicated that prior to April 3, 2020, at least 420 seasonal residents relocated to the county. That was considered unusual as usually seasonal residents tend to arrive later on. The publisher of several county related periodicals argued that locals should stop being so mean to those who support the local economy and advised people not shoot the golden goose. He also wanted locals to remember that resources such as the hospital were available to the community because of donations from seasonal residents.Door County Tourism Zone Executive Committee Meeting April 16, 2020, page 2 Private campgrounds were permitted to allow people with sufficiently advanced campers to camp beginning on April 24.

The school was established in 1935. History =1935-1955= Montego Bay High School was established in 1935 by the Government of Jamaica to fill the need of an all- girls high school in St. James. It was the first government-owned high school for girls established in the country. The school is owned by the Ministry of Education and administered by a local Board of Management. Prior to the establishment of Montego Bay High School, St. Helena’s High School (a private school for girls run by the Anglican Church) and situated at 46 Market Street in Montego Bay had been closed due to lack of funding. The then Custos of St. James, Sir Francis Kerr-Jarrett, along with Archdeacon E. S. Harrison of the Anglican Church, and the Hon. Phillip Lightbody, sitting member of the Legislative Council for St. James, successfully petitioned the Government to start a school for girls. The Government subsequently purchased the former Beaconsfield Hotel, located at 51 Union Street. It consisted of a two-storey house and outbuildings situated on approximately two acres of land. Because of the name of the property, the school became known as Beaconsfield School and the girls were colloquially called \\"Beacs\\" girls. Students from St. Helena were relocated to this new school which was officially named Montego Bay High School for Girls. Archdeacon Harrison became the first Board Chairman, and the affiliation with the Anglican Church has been maintained to the present day. The school started with forty (40) students and three teachers, under the leadership of the first headmistress, Miss Blanche Jeffrey-Smith. Students at the time prepared for two British-based examinations, the Junior and Senior Cambridge examinations. The Junior Cambridge was taken at the end of the fourth year and Senior at the end of the fifth year. The school could not field a sufficient number of candidates to warrant its own examination centre, so the girls wrote their examinations at Cornwall College along with the boys from that institution. The Higher School Certificate was introduced in 1949, and the first set of students sat their examinations in 1950. At that time, some of the sixth-form students had classes with the students at Cornwall College for some subjects and a number of boys from that school took classes at Montego Bay High School. The school had no science laboratories at the time, so practical work for the Cambridge Examinations was conducted at Cornwall College. Like many high schools in Jamaica during that period, most of the teachers at the time were expatriates from the United Kingdom. During the 1940s, the government discussed the idea of amalgamating the school with Cornwall College. However, it was decided to allow the school to continue its independent existence. During that decade, the leadership of the school was shared between Miss Ritchie (later Mrs. Croskery), Mrs. Marjorie Grahame, and Mrs. Janet Morrison. However, each headmistress would later hold the post for extended periods. As the student body increased, the need arose for new buildings to be erected. The current Needlework room was built in the forties and provided two classrooms. The present-day second-form block was erected soon after and subsequently, the outdoor stage area made way for the teachers' hostel with two classrooms on the ground floor. =1955-1980= In 1955, two temporary buildings were erected: one of bamboo and the other of corrugated aluminium. The former was called \\"Tattoo\\" and the latter the \\"Oasis\\". The \\"Tattoo\\" was demolished in the late fifties to make way for what is now the Main Building which contains administrative offices, staff room and lounge, chemistry, biology, as well as food and nutrition laboratories, art room, twelve classrooms, sanitary facilities and a large auditorium with a seating capacity of approximately one thousand persons. Mrs. Janet Morrison was the incumbent Headmistress when this building was constructed. =1980-Present= In the decade of the eighties, the parent-teacher association and past- students association spearheaded the construction of another building and so the aluminum structure gave way to the building which houses a library, physics and computer laboratories, a cafeteria and the Bursar’s office, along with sanitary facilities and store-rooms. The Ministry of Education recently added two classrooms to make room for a large number of grade nine students who were admitted in 2019. House system Upon initial enrollment in the school, each student is assigned to one of five houses. The house system was implemented in the fifties. Originally there were three houses: Jeffrey-Smith (named after the first Headmistress); Harrison (named after Archdeacon Harrison - the first board chairman); Denham (named after Sir Edward Denham, Governor of Jamaica at the time the school was established).

Āciṇṇa ordained as a novice in 1944, receiving full ordination in 1954. Immersed in the study of the Pāli Canon from his days as a novice, Āciṇṇa gradually broadened his scope of attention to include meditation, initially training under Mahasi Sayadaw and U Paṇḍitā. Not long after, Āciṇṇa would also decide to become a forest monk. In the months and years to follow, he would deepen his meditation abilities under the Kathitwaing, Thanlyin and Shwetheindaw sayadaws, eventually developing his own set of meditation methods, often collectively referred to as the \\"Pa-Auk method\\". On July 21, 1981, Āciṇṇa succeeded the Ven. Phelhtaw Sayadaw Aggapañña, at the latter's invitation, as the abbot of the Pa-Auk Forest Monastery. The monastery would then grow into a network of meditation centres across Southeast Asia and beyond, and is currently the largest network in Myanmar. Awards and honours In 2010, the national government awarded Āciṇṇa the title of Aggamahā Saddhammajotikadhaja (). In 2018, his title was raised to that of Abhidhaja Aggamahā Saddhammajotika (). In May 2017, Āciṇṇa was conferred an honorary doctorate of philosophy from Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University in Bangkok, Thailand.

It is currently owned by the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. The painting has been certified a real Rembrandt. The painting was listed in 1727 in the catalog of the Duke of Orléans collection, as a portrait of an Amsterdam mayor by Rembrandt. It remained in the noble family's possession until 1792, when Duke Louis-Philippe-Joseph sold the entire collection to finance his political career and pay off debts. The painting passed through several English collections into the hands of the Bourgeois brothers, art dealers from Cologne, who sold the painting as an original Rembrandt to the museum in 1886. The painting was stored away for a long time due to doubts cast over its authenticity. In the late 2000s, after works of restoration were conducted on the painting, scholars recognized it as an original Rembrandt. Subject matter The painting has long been thought to be a portrait of an Amsterdam mayor. It was listed thusly in the collection of the Duke of Orléans at the Palais Royal of Paris in 1727. However, the painting depicts the preacher Eleazar Swalmius, who was born in Rhoon, but operated in Amsterdam. Rembrandt painted this portrait in 1637, when the pastor was about 55 years old.Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van België. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Oude meesters, 1959, nr. 44 en in 1969 nr. 54. Swalmius was born in Rhoon to Hendrick van de Swalme, or Henricus Swalmius. Hendrick van de Swalme's family was probably originally from Flanders. His father spent time in England before becoming a preacher in the late 16th century. Like his father, Eleazar became a preacher too (Counter- Remostrant). Swalmius was active as a pastor in Poortugaal and Hoogvliet near Rotterdam since 1605 and in Schiedam between 1612 and 1622. In 1622 he settled in Amsterdam, where he would live up to his death, and be buried in the Oude Kerk in 1652. The Van der Swalme family must have known Rembrandt well. Carel, a brother of Eleazer and \\"dike count\\" (dijkgraaf) of Oranjepolder, for example, witnessed the drawing up of the will of Rembrandt van Rijn and Saskia van Uylenburgh. Composition Detail, Swalmius' nose In the dim brown background, with only a few, barely visible books on a table, the preacher seems to take up an imposing but nonostentatious volume. Rembrandt depicted the Amsterdam preacher almost life-size, in an extremely sober way. He sits relaxed on a low wooden armchair. He was painted three-quarter view. Swalmius doesn't look at the viewer penetratingly. The character's appearance gives the painting a relaxed ambience of confidentiality. His eyes are kind, his nose rubicund. Rather than showing his wisdom, his long white beard enhances the friendliness of his appearance, especially to the modern viewer. There was probably a relationship between the painter and the sitter. As mentioned, Rembrandt knew his client and his family personally. Provenance In the eighteenth century, the canvas was located in the Palais Royal in Paris, where the art collection of the Duke of Orléans, brother of Louis XIV, was kept. The painting was recorded in 1727 in the catalog of this collection and described as a portrait of a mayor by Rembrandt. The painting remained in the family's possession until 1792, when Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orléans sold the entire art collection to finance his political career and to pay off his debts. The painting passed through various English collections into the hands of the Bourgeois art dealers, who sold the work to Antwerp Royal Museum of Fine Arts in 1886, for 200 000 francs. The painting was acquired by the Museum as an original Rembrandt.Koninklijk Muzeum van Schoone Kunsten. Beschrijvend Catalogus. I. Oude meesters, 1905, p. 249-250.Wenke Mast, Highlights, Website K.M.S.K.A., 2011. Details The painting is signed Rembrandt. f 1637 in the recto's top right corner. The f stands for fecit.Smith, Catal. Raisonné, VII, nr. 274, bl. 102. As early as 1969, Gerson wrote that the signature did not seem original. Because the painting also seemed “too tame” (tame, not expressive enough) to him, he attributed the work to Rembrandt's pupil Govert Flinck. Curator Jeroen Giltaij wrote that indeed little of Rembrandt's strength was visible in the painting, and that the beard was rather sketchy. However, Giltaij could not say whether it was Flinck who made the work. Upon restoration, the thick yellow layer of varnish turned out to be the main culprit. This layer prevented spectators from appreciating the nuances in the preacher's pink skin tones and black clothes. After the restoration, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp invited Rembrandt expert Ernst van de Wetering to study and assess the painting. He was of the opinion that, contrary to what Gerson originally claimed, the painting is a real Rembrandt. This is the accepted conclusion at the moment. Due to doubts over its authenticity, the work was in storage for a long time. After confirmation by Van de Wetering, the KMSKA decided that the work was to be given a permanent spot in the Museum's collection upon the reopening of the former.Jeroen Giltaij, Lezing en notities over de schilderijen van Rembrandt en school in het Museum voor Schone Kunsten van Antwerpen, 2006.

He was killed in action during the second battle of Guam in World War II and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.  Early life and career  Hector de Zayas was born on September 7, 1910, in New York City. After graduating from Peekskill Military Academy, de Zayas was enrolled at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps upon graduating with the class of 1932. De Zayas then reported to The Basic School at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After graduating from The Basic School in April 1933, he reported to the Marine Barracks in Boston, Massachusetts. From late 1933 to mid 1934, de Zayas served aboard the USS New Mexico before a brief assignment to the USS Richmond. By October 1934, he was assigned to the USS Trenton, serving on that ship until mid 1935. De Zayas was then attached to the 1st Marine Brigade in Quantico, Virginia, remaining there until the end of 1936. In January 1937, he began attending the tank course at Fort Benning, Georgia. After graduating from the course that summer, he returned to the 1st Marine Brigade's newly activated 1st Tank Company in Quantico. That October, de Zayas assumed command of the company. While de Zayas was critical of the Marmon-Herrington CTL-3 tanks, characterizing them as unreliable, he remained in Quantico until 1939. Afterwards, he was stationed in China with Headquarters Company, 4th Marine Regiment, staying there until mid 1941.  World War II  On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into World War II. De Zayas was soon afterwards assigned as the commanding officer of 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines. In September 1942, de Zayas' regiment deployed to American Samoa and was assigned to the 2nd Marine Brigade. The 3rd Marines then moved to New Zealand to conduct combat training and in June 1943, the regiment was assigned to the 3rd Marine Division. The division then moved to Guadalcanal and conducted mock amphibious landings at Efate. = Bougainville campaign = On November 1, 1943, the 3rd Marine Division assaulted Bougainville. Landing at Blue Beach 2, Lieutenant Colonel de Zayas' battalion was the first to reach the island and faced little resistance from the defending Japanese. On November 20, de Zayas led 2/3 in breaking an enemy roadblock on the Numa-Numa Trail, discovering a 400-foot ridge. He then ordered one of his company commanders to take the ridge. A platoon led by First Lieutenant Steve J. Cibik moved ahead of the battalion, holding the ridge against several counterattacks for the next four days. De Zayas' battalion was crossing the Piva River on November 21 when the Marines were pinned down by heavy fire from a Japanese bunker complex. De Zayas moved forward to personally direct the fire of his Marines before leading part of his unit around the enemy position. De Zayas then encountered an enemy battalion supporting the bunker system, and was able to withdraw his men with minimal casualties. The information de Zayas gathered on the bunker system during this action was instrumental in destroying the bunkers. On November 24, de Zayas led his Marines forward 250 yards under heavy fire, taking heavy casualties while crossing a meandering stream eight times. The battle of Piva Forks concluded the next day. For his actions during the battle, de Zayas was awarded the Silver Star. On December 25, the 3rd Marines left Bougainville and returned to Guadalcanal. = Battle of Guam = On July 21, 1944, de Zayas led his battalion ashore at Red Beach One near Adelup Point during the battle of Guam. De Zayas attempted to lead his Marines up over the ridge overlooking the beach between Chonito Cliff and Bundschu Ridge, but fierce enemy resistance kept his entire regiment pinned down. Company E was able to take the high ground by the end of the day, but only after the Japanese had withdrawn. De Zayas' battalion spent the entire next day continuously engaging the enemy. On July 25, 2/3 punched through enemy cave defenses on the drive toward Fonte Ridge. That night and into the next morning, his battalion helped to repulse multiple Japanese banzai attacks. Both sides took heavy casualties. By dawn, de Zayas learned of the potential of a second enemy attack and moved to the front lines to reposition his men. While he was in this exposed forward position, de Zayas was shot and killed by a Japanese sniper. The executive officer of 2/3, Major William A. Culpepper, assumed command for the remainder of the battle. De Zayas was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and a road leading to the 3rd Marine Regiment's command post on Guam was named \\"De Zayas Road.\\" He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Stone’s wall-mounted or suspended sculptural constructions, often composed of layers of painted transparent film, paper, or metal, have been exhibited in museums, galleries, and public collections worldwide. Installations by Stone have been commissioned for the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, Ann Arbor, MI; Microsoft, Redmond, WA; Facebook, Seattle, WA; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA; Ascent at Roebling’s Bridge Covington, KY; the Federal Courthouse, Jackson Mississippi; Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St Louis, MO; Columbia University School of Nursing, New York, NY; Twin Parks, Taichung, Taiwan; and other public institutions and collections. Stone’s artworks were exhibited in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad as part of the US Art in Embassies Program. In 2014 Stone was commissioned by Seattle’s Sound Transit Light Rail to create a permanent site-specific artwork for the South Bellevue Station, Bellevue, WA.  Education  Stone received a BFA in Drawing, Painting, and Printmaking, from Iowa State University in 1992, and an MFA in Painting, from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA in 1994.  Early Influences and Central Themes  Since her childhood years in rural Iowa, nature and the landscape have interested Stone whose work reveals her fascination “with natural processes from the cellular to the cosmic.” Stone recounts, “growing up in rural Iowa, I developed a connection to the landscape and the particular intensity of feeling that it gave me – feelings that were also produced by the sublime green shag carpet in my childhood bedroom. This notion of revelatory experience through nature, materials and color has always inspired my work.” In a 2015 interview with Kimberly Chun for the San Francisco Chronicle, Stone identifies \\"mysticism, nature, and the power and energy that’s under all processes and forms of life” as motivating forces in her work. Following graduate school Stone’s early work focused “almost exclusively on creating site-specific, temporary installations with an ever-expanding repertoire of materials culled from thrift and craft stores that embodied the actions and forms that [Stone] had been painting on paper.” Stone’s interest in materials that “interact with light or that are physically light, transparent or translucent” led her to experiment with cutting and painting directly on clear plastic overhead transparencies. This was a generative discovery for the artist. Stone explains, “it was like flat paper but clear. I could cut it out with scissors, and when I hung it on a wall, light would go through it, creating a second shadow version of the work.” To achieve this desired effect in her installation artworks, Stone frequently paints on archival transparent Dura-Lar film which she pins to the wall or suspends from the ceiling. Stone also paints on aluminum or steel cutouts installed to float on the wall, allowing a shadow to be cast by her forms. In a review of Stone’s 2020 exhibition Light Currents held at the Ryan Lee Gallery, New York, art critic Angela M.H. Schuster describes Stone’s process and motivations, “Working primarily in aluminum, Dura-Lar, and dichroic plastic, the artist combines the visual language of organic forms found in nature — seascapes, cloud formations, and celestial bodies — with these industrial materials to create a signature multidimensional hybrid of sculpture and painting. For Stone, “light, time, cosmic forces, and natural phenomena become literal and metaphorical guides” for her artistic meditations.  Exhibitions  Stone’s installation artworks were shown in solo exhibitions at the Greg Kucera Gallery, Seattle in 2002, and in 2003 at Suyama Space, Seattle, WA. In 2005 Stone created a site-specific installation for her solo exhibition at The Boise Art Museum. In 2006 Stone designed a sculptural installation forming “gentle colored rains, spattering down and around her cascades of transparent sheets” which was exhibited at the Patricia Faure Gallery in Los Angeles alongside paintings by Llyn Foulkes. In 2008 Stone’s solo exhibition A Season Swirling (Unfurling) took place at the Missoula Art Museum, Missoula, MT. Stone lived in Montana from 1996-2001 and the central theme of her Missoula exhibition was “based on the Montana landscape and the artist's impressions and memories of the rhythm of its seasons.” In 2013 Stone’s artwork Lunar Drift (2011) was included in the exhibition Flow just Flow, held at the Harnett Museum of Art, University of Richmond. In 2019 Stone’s solo exhibition Once Upon A Time was organized by the Kansas City Art Institute. In 2020 Stone’s solo exhibition Light Currents was held at the Ryan Lee Gallery, New York.  Public Art Commissions  In 2011 Stone’s artwork Horizon, (2011) was commissioned by the General Services Administration’s Art in Architecture Program for the Jackson Federal Courthouse, Jackson, MS. Other artists who have received commissions from the GSA’s Art in Architecture Program include Mark di Suvero, Robert Irwin, Teresita Fernandez, Ellen Harvey, Betty Woodman, Jenny Holzer, Spencer Finch, and Nina Katchadourian. Also in 2011, Stone’s 14’ x 13’ x 3” acrylic on aluminum sculpture Life Sign, (2011) was commissioned by the Washington Institute of Technology, Kirkland, WA. Stone notes that the artwork \\"expresses the idea of life at both the microscopic and macroscopic level, and symbolizes the concept of interconnectedness.” Stone’s artwork was acquired for the Washington State Art Collection in partnership with Lake Washington Technical College. In 2014 Stone was commissioned to create site- specific permanent installations for Seattle’s City Light Tech Training Center and the forthcoming Sound Transit Light Rail’s South Bellevue Station, Bellevue, WA. In 2017 Stone’s installation Columbia Ray (2017) was commissioned by the Columbia University School of Nursing. Stretching to 41 feet, Stone’s “sculptural relief installation is made of 1,200 individual pieces of hand-painted laser-cut acrylic in vibrant shades of yellow, attached to the wall with custom standoff hardware that makes each piece appear to be floating.” “The work suggests a ray of light, a striking formal addition to the space, and a metaphor for the trajectory and reach of education,” said Stone. “That art can be a tool for healing, a portal to another mental state, is important to my work. And it seems magnified in a setting that is about life and health,” said Stone. Stone’s artworks have also been commissioned by the Barnes Jewish Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, and Michigan State University School of Nursing. In 2017, Stone’s artwork Cascadia was commissioned by Facebook while Stone was an Art in Residence at Facebook’s Headquarters in Seattle Washington.

It is a non-governmental, non-profit organization that has legal status and its building is located in Panama City. The institution was founded in 1962 as the Panamanian Institute of Art (Spanish: ), in 1983 it became the current museum. The museum is in charge for being a cultural institution for the diffusion of knowledge and appreciation of contemporary art, promoting cultural and creative development. Its collections are made up of more than 700 works created by Panamanian and Latin American artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.  History  The Panamanian Institute of Art (Panarte) was founded in 1962 as a non-profit institution dedicated to promoting Panamanian art. In 1983 it became the Museum of Contemporary Art of Panama (MAC Panama), a private entity paid for by companies and art lovers. At its foundation, in 1962, the Panamanian Institute of Art, operated in rented premises and, in addition to art exhibitions, presented plays, concerts and films by renowned directors. Despite not having its own facilities, it had a large number of exhibitions by renowned Panamanian and Latin American artists, receiving a work from each exhibitor as a donation. In this way, it was creating a valuable collection, but without its own shelter. In 1983, the Panarte board of directors decided to look for walls for the Collection, so that it could continue to grow in size and excellence. A great campaign was started, where many people and companies contributed. With what was contributed in addition to a loan from the Panama Savings Bank, it was possible to buy and remodel the old Masonic Temple located in Ancón, in the Former Panama Canal Zone. In this way, it was possible to give walls to the permanent collection and the Museum of Contemporary Art, belonging to Panarte, was created. The transformation process was carried out by Coqui Calderón and Graciela de Eleta who received the Order of Vasco Núñez de Balboa as recognition.  Collections  The museum is made up of around 700 works of art, the MAC collection has specific works from dates prior to 1962, which allow us to complete a panoramic vision of the styles of the 20th century. It covers all techniques: painting, sculpture, graphics, photography and, more recently, installations. It features works by prominent artists, both Panamanian and Latin American. The permanent collection includes: * Works by Panamanian artists. * Works from the 20th century to the present. * Works by renowned international artists. * Historical memory of Panamanian Art.  Educational programming  In addition to the exhibitions of the Permanent Collection and national and international temporary exhibitions, guided tours are offered for groups or schools, drawing, painting and graphic design classes, educational workshops, seminars and talks on appreciation and history of art. The MAC also has a framing workshop.  Archives  The Museum has a wide selection of catalogs on its exhibitions, representation of books and written materials on Panamanian and Latin American artists, as well as volumes on certain artistic periods to support the research of the student community.

She is a senior researcher at the SPHERE joint team of CNRS and Paris Diderot University, where she and Agathe Keller (who studies mathematical Sanskrit texts) are co-directors of the SAW project (Mathematical Sciences in the Ancient World) headed by Karine Chemla (an expert in ancient Chinese mathematics). Education and career Following a two-decade long career as a secondary mathematics teacher, including an agrégation in Mathematics in 1992, Proust studied epistemology and history of science at Paris Diderot University, earning a diplôme d'études approfondies in 1999 and a doctorate in 2004, supervised by . She completed a habilitation at Paris Diderot in 2010, and became a director of research in the SPHERE laboratory in 2011. Proust was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton during 2009, a visiting scholar at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University during 2010, and a resident at the Institut Méditerranéen de Recherches Avancées in Marseille during 2010–2011. Scholarship In her thesis work, Proust edited and analyzed two long-neglected collections of Old Babylonian mathematical tablets that constitute part of the vast trove of artifacts excavated at Nippur by John Punnett Peters, John Henry Haynes and Hermann Hilprecht in the late 1800s. This work resulted in the publication of two books, 'Tablettes mathématiques de Nippur' and 'Tablettes mathématiques de la collection Hilprecht'. The first is an edition of the tablets housed at the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul and an improved reconstruction of the curriculum for elementary scribal education in mathematics at Old Babylonian Nippur, the second an edition of the tablets housed in the Hilprecht Collection at the University of Jena. (Other Nippur tablets at the University of Pennsylvania and had been previously studied by Eleanor Robson.) Proust's work produced the most detailed reconstruction of the process of elementary scribal education at Old Babylonian Nippur, including the curriculum and timelines, the interaction of education in Sumerian language and mathematics (Sumerian was a foreign language to the Akkadian speakers of the Old Babylonian era), and the interaction between metrological calculation and abstract calculation using sexagesimal place-value notation. With Alexander Jones she curated the exhibit Before Pythagoras: The Culture of Old Babylonian Mathematics (2010–2011) at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) in New York in which a number of mathematically important clay tablets, including YBC 7289 and Plimpton 322 were on display. Proust has also been involved in study of the papers and correspondence of the noted historian Otto Neugebauer, who largely initiated the study of mathematical cuneiform texts in the mid-twentieth century. Some of this material was on display at the ISAW exhibit Books Proust is the author of Tablettes mathématiques de Nippur (De Boccard, 2007) and of Tablettes mathématiques de la collection Hilprecht (Harrassowitz, 2008). She is the editor of books including: *Scientific Sources and Teaching Contexts Throughout History: Problems and Perspectives (with Alain Bernard, Springer, 2014) *A Mathematician's Journeys: Otto Neugebauer and Modern Transformations of Ancient Science (with Alexander Jones and John Steele, Springer, 2016) *Scholars and Scholarship in Late Babylonian Uruk (with John Steele, Springer, 2019) Recognition Proust was the 2011 winner of the , given by the French Academy of Sciences in recognition of the body of her work and, in particular, for her publication of the Nippur tablets. She became a corresponding member of the International Academy of the History of Science in 2019.

It was introduced by the league in 2020. The system was introduced in mid 2020 and will be active for the first time during the 2020–21 season. It is a successor to the U.S. Soccer Development Academy. The system covers the under-13, under-14, under-15, under-16, under-17 and under-19 age groups.  History  Organized youth soccer affiliated with Major League Soccer began with various MLS academy teams playing in the Super Y-League at its foundation in 1999. In 2007, the United States Soccer Federation created an elite academy league called the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, which featured academy teams of MLS teams, along with several non-MLS academies across the United States and Canada. The intention of the USSDA was to create a top division of youth soccer in the United States and Canada. USSDA's goal was to connect national team coaches at all age levels directly with elite youth players, while also serving as a venue for advanced coaching and referee development. Unlike most professional soccer leagues in the United States and Canada, but much like professional soccer leagues abroad, USSDA ran on a winter-based schedule, with the seasons beginning in late August or early September and ending in June, with a winter break from mid December to mid February. The league was unique among other professional soccer leagues domestically, as it runs on a winter- based schedule. The season generally begins in September and ends in June or July. There is usually a hiatus in January and February, and players have the summer off. Most of the clubs are associated with professional teams, either in North America through MLS, the NASL or the USL, or with European clubs. The professional teams cover most, if not all of the fees, while the academies offer a pipeline of talent to the professional club.

It is named after French botanist and cactus expert Charles Antoine Lemaire.Urs Eggli, Leonard E. Newton: Etymological Dictionary of Succulent Plant Names. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 2010, , S. 135. Taxonomy Melocactus lemairei was described by M. Chevalier de Monville, Charles Antoine Lemaire, and Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel, and published in L'Horticulteur Universel. Description Melocactus lemairei is a cylindrical or slightly pyramid-shaped green cactus that can grow up to 20 cm (8 inches) in height, and 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) in diameter. It has between 9 and 10 ribs with 8 to 10 spines each. These spines are yellow to brown in color, and can reach anywhere from 2 to 3 cm (1 inch) in length. The cephalium is brown, with white wool and thorn-like bristles, and grows up to 10 cm (4 inches). The flowers are pink, and grow to 2 cm long; they also have a diameter of 1.5 cm, protruding up to 1.2 cm from the cephalium. The pink fruits are up to 2 cm long. Distribution and habitat Melocactus lemairei is endemic to Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti). It grows in dry, rocky soils, and also occurs in humid depressions. It can also be found on sea cliffs and rocky offshore islands. Conservation Melocactus lemairei is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List due to it being found in less than 10 locations on Hispaniola, as well as being threatened by collection from the wild and by land clearing for agriculture, industry, and urban development. Based on current knowledge of habitat degradation in Haiti, as well as it only containing one known population of this species, Melocactus lemairei is probably under threat in Haiti. This species is threatened by collection from the wild in the Dominican Republic; the cactus is often used as medicine and sold.

The act abolished the British National Oil Corporation and transferred its assets to the Agency.  Background  The government had established the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) in 1975 under the provisions of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 (1975 c. 74). BNOC, as constituted, was effectively two businesses: firstly for the production of oil and petroleum, and secondly for trading in oil. The Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 (1982 c. 23) enabled the government to transfer the upstream oil exploration and production side of the BNOC's business into Britoil, a limited liability company. Britoil was floated on the stock market in November 1982 and again in August 1985. The downstream trading side of the business remained within BNOC. However, by 1983 with falling oil prices, participation and trading in the petroleum markets ceased to be profitable for BNOC. The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 provided the legal mechanism whereby BNOC was abolished and the Crown's interest in petroleum pipelines and storage installations was transferred into a new corporate body, the Oil and Pipelines Agency.  Oil and Pipelines Act 1985  The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 (1985 c. 62) received Royal Assent on 30 October 1985. Its long title is: ‘An Act to provide for the establishment and functions of a body corporate to be called the Oil and Pipelines Agency, for the vesting in that Agency of the property, rights and liabilities of the British National Oil Corporation and for the subsequent dissolution of that Corporation.’ = Provisions = The Act comprises 8 Sections and 4 Schedules. * Section 1 – established the Oil and Pipelines Agency, comprising a chairman and two to four other members appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy. * Section 2 – defined the functions of the Agency including the power to buy, sell or deal in petroleum and to manage on behalf of the Crown petroleum pipelines and storage installations. * Section 3 – transferred to the Agency the property and rights of the British National Oil Corporation. * Section 4 – placed a duty on the Agency to dispose of the surplus property, rights and liabilities of the corporation. * Section 5 – placed a duty on the Agency to comply with any instruction from the Secretary of State. * Section 6 – Interpretation of terms. * Section 7 – Amendments and repeals of Legislation. * Section 8 – Short title, commencement and extent. * Schedule 1 – The Agency: appointment and tenure of members, remuneration, staff, proceedings, documents. * Schedule 2 –Supplementary provisions of Section 3. * Schedule 3 – Financial and other provisions, borrowing, loans and grants by, and payments to, the Secretary of State, annual reports and accounts, audits. * Schedule 4 – Repeals: Part 1 (Sections 1–16) of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975, which had established BNOC; and Sections 1 to 7 of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, which related to the powers of BNOC.  Consequential legislation  The provisions of the Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 came into force on 1 December 1985. The appointed day for the transfer of assets from BNOC to the OPA was 1 December 1985 (Statutory Instrument S.I. 1985/1749) The British National Oil Corporation was dissolved 27 March 1986 (S.I. 1986/585).

History During the period of the Nanjing Decade, the Imperial Japanese forces staged the Manchurian Incident, which prompted the urgency of the Chinese government in strengthening the national defense of the capital city; Commandant of the Chinese Military Academy General Zhang Zhizhong first proposed to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek the building of Jurong airbase to guard Nanjing. The construction of Jurong airbase was completed in 1934, requiring 610,000 cubic meters of earthwork, over 220,000 yuan in labor and miscellaneous expenses. On 13 August 1937, in what is known as the first battle of World War II in Asia, the Chinese Air Force had dispatched the following units to Jurong airbase in support of the Battle of Shanghai and defense of Nanjing: the 17th Pursuit Squadron, 3rd Pursuit Group composed of Boeing P-26/281 fighters, which included pilots Liu Lanqing, Qin Jiazhu, along with members of the original Chinese-American volunteer group of fighter pilots John \\"Buffalo\\" Huang and John Wong Pan-Yang, plus pilots and crew of the 28th PS, 5th PG flying the Curtiss Hawk II fighters that included Capt.

Chen Yau-Wei, and several additional Hawk IIs and a Hawk III from the 34th Provisional PS.http://www.shanghai1937.tv On 15 August 1937, the air raid warning net established with the help of the American advisor to the Chinese Air Force, Claire Lee Chennault, reported an incoming flight of 16-20 IJN G3M twin-engined fast bombers entering the airspace over Suzhou on approach to Nanjing, whose mission was to neutralize Chinese Air Force assets at Jurong airbase; Jurong scrambled eight 17th PS P-26/281 fighters, seven 28th PS Hawk IIs, five 8th PS CR.32s, and five Hawk IIs plus a single Hawk III to engage the incoming Japanese raiders. In the ensuing confusion of the battle, Maj. John Wong Pan-yang (flying the P-26/281 #1703) is credited with the first enemy aircraft of the raid shot down, identified as the 4th or 5th bomber of the Kisarazu Kokutai Shotai led by Lt. Yoshida. Maj. Wong would share in another G3M with Lt. Su Yongxiang. Lt. Qin Jiazhu (flying the P-26/281 #1702) would shoot down another G3M which crashed southeast of Nanjing, Capt. Cen Zeliu and Lt. Liu Qiwei shared one kill, while Capt. Chan Kee-wong shot up two G3Ms that were observed to have went down over Nanjing; these kills may have been the shared kills made by Capt. Chen and Lt.

He is known for his ecumenical work and for being the first African American to serve as Moderator of the General Assembly for the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.  History  = Early life and ministry = Edler Garnet Hawkins was born in the Bronx in 1908 to parents who had moved to New York City from North Carolina and Virginia. He had four siblings, of whom two died in infancy. As a child, Hawkins worked as a housepainter and attended high school in the Bronx. Following this, Hawkins enrolled as an undergraduate at Bloomfield College in New Jersey and later enrolled in the Union Seminary in New York City in order to become a minister. Among his mentors and influences at the seminary were President Henry Sloane Coffin, Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, and Harry F. Ward. He graduated from the seminary in 1938 and was invited to become the organizing pastor for St. Augustine Presbyterian Church in the Bronx. The church, which during the 1930s served a mostly white congregation, was in a neighborhood experiencing a racial transformation, and a congregant of the church had convinced them to invite an African American minister to the church. As minister at St. Augustine, Hawkins was given a large degree of freedom in his style of ministry, and shortly after his arrival, he used his position to attack the \\"Bronx slave market,\\" an exploitative market in the Bronx where African American women were hired as domestic workers for low pay. As minister, Hawkins, who had garnered the nickname of \\"Renaissance Man,\\" oversaw the growth of St. Augustine from a small church to a significant institution in the Harlem–Bronx community, with over 1,000 members. At one point, Sammy Davis Jr. performed a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall to help the church. = Ecumenicism and later life = Following World War II, Hawkins became more involved on a national level within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. He supported numerous ecumenical groups, including the World Council of Churches, the Federal Council of Churches, and the National Council of Churches. For the latter, he represented the Presbyterian faction in that group. In 1958, Hawkins was elected moderator of the Presbytery of New York, and in 1964, he became the first African American elected as the Moderator of the General Assembly for the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA). While Moderator, he became the first Protestant leader from the United States to visit the pope when Pope Paul VI received him in August that year. Following his term as moderator, Hawkins attended the 1968 Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Uppsala, Sweden as the UPCUSA's representative. He would later be elected to that organization's Central Committee in 1974, where he played a major role in defending the council's Programme to Combat Racism. In 1971, Hawkins accepted a position as professor at Princeton Seminary for practical theology and black studies. Hawkins died several years later in 1977.

Section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867  Section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867 states: In the 1930s, in cases such as Re Adoption Act of Ontario (where the reasoning of Duff C.J. was subsequently adopted by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works), provincial legislatures were restricted from vesting in administrative tribunals powers ordinarily exercised by judges appointed under s. 96. This was relaxed in the Residential Tenancies Reference to allow for such tribunals to exercise ancillary “judicial” powers, subject to the qualification that the judicial function must not be isolated from the rest of the administrative structure of the legislation. Whether a tribunal could exercise such powers was made subject to a three-step test:Residential Tenancies Reference, pp. 734736 :* did the \\"Superior, District, and County Courts\\" exercise an identical or analogous power at the time Canada was created in 1867? ::* if not, power can be conferred on a provincial tribunal whatever its primary character :* after examining the institutional context, does it becomes apparent that the power is not being exercised as a “judicial power”? ::* whether any particular function is \\"judicial\\" is not to be determined simply on the basis of procedural trappings ::* where the tribunal is faced with a private dispute between parties, and is called upon to adjudicate through the application of a recognized body of rules in a manner consistent with fairness and impartiality, then it is normally acting in a \\"judicial capacity\\" ::* the judicial task involves questions of \\"principle\\", as opposed to \\"policy\\" :* what is its setting in the institutional arrangements in which it appears? In that regard, allowable circumstances are those where: ::* the powers are merely subsidiary or ancillary to general administrative functions assigned to the tribunal ::* the powers may be necessarily incidental to the achievement of a broader policy goal of the legislature A provincial scheme is only invalid where the adjudicative function is a sole or central function of the tribunal.

The teleplay by Janet Brownell is based on the 1958 musical of the same name, which in turn was based on the 1835 fairytale The Princess and the Pea by Hans Christian Andersen. It stars Carol Burnett, Dennis O'Hare and Tracy Ullman and features Tom Smothers, Matthew Morrison, Edward Hibbert, Michael Boatman, and Zooey Deschanel. It was aired on December 18, 2005 as the eighth episode of the forty-seventh season of The Wonderful World of Disney. It received moderate to positive reviews and was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards.  Plot  A chorus introduces a kingdom where no one can marry until Prince Dauntless does, but his mother, Queen Aggravain, has incredibly high standards for his bride. One princess is seen answering questions to prove if she is a good enough princess for Dauntless. She answers one question incorrectly and Aggravain tells her that \\"A genuine princess is exceedingly rare,\\" before promptly kicking her out of the castle. While having breakfast, Dauntless mentions to Aggravain that he suspects that she is purposely turning down all the princesses. She denies this, though it's true. Meanwhile, Lady Larkin has discovered that she is pregnant and that she and Sir Harry, captain of the guard, need to find Dauntless a bride so that they themselves can get married. Harry brings back Winnifred, a princess from the northern swamps. Though Aggravain is disgusted by Winnifred, Dauntless falls instantly in love with her. Dauntless and the ladies of the court take Winnifred to get dry, as she swam the moat to get into the palace, and Aggravain consults with the Wizard to pick a test. Aggravain decides that the test should be on sensitivity, something Winnifred surely knows nothing about. They decide to test her that evening by placing a tiny pea under thirty goose- feather mattresses. Aggravain concludes that if Winnifred can feel the pea, then she will be a proper pick for Dauntless. As Winnifred is getting dressed, she is visited by the much nicer King Sextimus, the real ruler of the kingdom who is mute, and his Jester. The Jester explains that Sextimus was cursed by a witch and that it would only be reversed when \\"The mouse devours the hawk.\\" Dauntless and the ladies of the court are then entertained by Winnifred's stories from living in a swamp. After a round of croquet, Aggravain tells Winnifred and Dauntless that they will be holding a ball later that evening to celebrate Winnifred's arrival. Secretly, Aggravain tells the Wizard that they will be dancing to the Spanish Panic, one of the most tiring dances ever, in order to ensure that Winnifred sleeps and fails the test. Larkin meets up with Harry and tells him that Winnifed will never pass the test, and that Harry should have found a better princess. She asks him to help Winnifred cheat but as captain of the guard, he is conflicted. At the ball, Winnifred survives the dance and even suggests that everyone do it a second time, much to Aggravain's fury. Dauntless cheers up Winnifred by telling her that he loves her. He then expresses to the citizens in the kingdom how much he loves Winnifred and how different she is than all the other princesses he's met. The Wizard and the Kingdom staff prepare for the evening by stacking thirty mattresses in a tower of the castle. Lady Larkin sees the group and follows, unaware that it's a secret. She accidentally asks a question, is discovered, and then is sent to the castle prison for the evening. Meanwhile, Winnifred and Dauntless study academics for the test which they think will be the next day. He says goodnight and leaves her alone where she dreams of her happily ever after with him. Dauntless pays a visit to his father asking for a \\"man to man talk\\" about having children. Sextimus explains this as best he can through hand movements but Dauntless eventually realizes that he wants to marry Winnifred. Walking the halls in the castle, Winnifred sees Larkin and frees her from the cell. Larkin finds Harry and apologizes only to hear that Harry has decided to help Winnifred cheat. They romanticize about going to Normandy after they're married. At the same time, the Wizard has given Aggravain the \\"smallest pea in the kingdom\\" and they go to place it. Unbeknownst to them, Sextimus was listening secretly to their conversation and proceeds to explain the plan to the Jester, Harry and Larkin. In her room, Aggravain dreams about ruling the kingdom for the rest of her life and goes to place the pea under the bottom mattress. Winnifred enters the tower where she is given opium to drink and a nightingale (really just the Wizard in a costume) to sing a lullaby to help her sleep. She practically falls asleep on the ladder up to the top of the bed but once she is atop, she feels poked and hurt by the mattress. She sends the Wizard out of the room and rips open the mattress angrily. Exhausted from trying to find the source of the pain, she begins to count sheep. The next morning, Aggravain informs Dauntless of the real test and how Winnifred is sure to have failed. However, Winnifred enters counting sheep in the thousands and reveals to the court that she never closed her eyes. Dauntless tells her that she passed but Aggravain quickly tries to come up with excuses to prevent him from marrying. Finally he says \\"I told you to shut up!\\" and she goes silent. The Jester realizes that the curse had been about Aggravain all along and that Sextimus can now speak and rule once again. Larkin and Harry embrace and go off to be wed but reveal to the court that Winnifred wasn't actually hurt by a pea. The Jester is then seen taking various medieval weapons out of the mattresses and wheeling them out of the tower. Dauntless brings Winnifred back into the room to let her sleep again but she still feels a slight pain, revealing that she could have felt the pea even if the others hadn't cheated. Dauntless takes the pea out and she sleeps soundly as he watches on. A title card reading \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" is seen.

She is an associate professor of African American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Early life and education Jones was born on May 29, 1975. She earned her master's degree and PhD in Sociology and Criminology from the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the first person to earn a Ph.D. in criminology from any top ten research university in the United States. Career Upon earning her PhD, Jones accepted an assistant professor position in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara for the 2004–05 academic year. In this role, she earned a William T. Grant Award for Early Career Scholars to fund her research project titled Pathways to Freedom: How Young People Create a Life After Incarceration. A few years later, Jones published her first book titled Between Good and Ghetto: African American Girls and Inner City Violence, which won the New Scholar Award from the American Society of Criminology. The book was an ethnographic study of violence within the inner-city of Philadelphia amongst adolescent girls. She focused on how the girls oscillate between protecting themselves against daily threats of physical violence and conforming to White middle- class gender norms. The following year, Jones published her second book, which was edited by criminologist Meda Chesney-Lind, titled Fighting for Girls: New Perspectives on Gender and Violence. Similar to her first book, Jones focused on adolescent girls and the moral panic caused by media representations surrounding them as becoming increasingly violent. Her research found that a spike in arrest numbers for adolescent girls were the cause of this panic, not an actual increase in violence. She placed the blame of the increase on zero- tolerance policies in schools and mandatory arrest policies. As a result of her research, Jones was appointed Chair of the American Sociological Association's Race, Gender and Class Section from 2012 until 2013. During this time, she also co-led a research project with Geoff Raymond called Identifying Good Strangers: A Micro-Interactional Approach, funded by a $592,699 three- year grant. Jones left the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2013 to join the department of African American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Following the Shooting of Philando Castile, Jones collaborated with Raymond on a three-year project to help police develop better communication methods. She also established the Justice Interaction Lab during the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement with funding from the William T. Grant Foundation. Her third book, The Chosen Ones: Black Men and the Politics of Redemption, reflected on her recent research and focused on the victimization of young black men by urban gun violence.

It was written and illustrated by Hideo Yamamoto, and is noted as one of his sole works in the comedy genre. Its title is a parodic reference to \\"Gay Report\\", a report published by the LGBT rights group (also known a OCCUR) noted as the first large-scale survey of gay life in Japan conducted by gay men. OCCUR protested Okama Report for containing what it argued were stereotypical and inaccurate depictions of LGBT people, particularly its failure to distinguish between gay male sexual orientation and transgender gender identity. In response, publisher Shogakukan ceased publishing collected tankōbon editions of the manga, discontinuing the release of the series after two volumes. The series was subsequently printed in full twice: as five tankōbon volumes published from October 1996 to June 1997, and as three bunkobon volumes published from May to June 2009. Both the 1996 and 2009 editions contain \\"On how to portray male homosexuals\\", a postscript from OCCUR noting that the series contains exaggerated and inaccurate depictions of LGBT people. =Original video animation (OVA)= Okama Report was adapted into a three- part original video animation (OVA) produced by Toshiba EMI from 1991 to 1992.

She currently serves as district supervisor of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, a position she was elected to on November 5, 2019. Smith has served on the Board since January 2016, where she is also chairwoman of the Board's Development Process Committee and as a member of several more committees. Before she was elected to the Board of Supervisors, Smith served as the Sully District Representative to the Fairfax County School Board for 14 years. From the beginning of her time in office, Smith has represented 100,000 residents.  Early life and career  Smith is originally from New Jersey, and she began her career as a teacher. After graduating from Muhlenberg College with a dual Bachelor of Arts in sociology and elementary education, Smith taught first grade in New Jersey and then second grade at an international school in Saudi Arabia, for a total of seven years. She stopped working to raise her children full time until she began running for office. Smith moved to the Sully district of Fairfax, Virginia in 1984 with her husband, Steve. The couple have four grown children, who all attended Fairfax County Public Schools while growing up. Smith's public career began when she served as PTA president at the three schools her children attended: Poplar Tree Elementary School, Rocky Run Middle School, and Chantilly High School.  Political beliefs  Smith is a member of the Democratic Party. Throughout her political career, she has advocated for improved education, transportation, and environmental protections.  Election Run, 2015-2016  Smith first ran for office in 2015-16 as a candidate to replace retiring supervisor Michael R. Frey, who had held the position for 24 years. In a 2015 interview, Smith distinguished herself from her opponent, Republican John Guevara, by noting \\"We see the job of supervisor and the role of local government very differently.\\" She went on to say that she would work full-time in the position, prioritize education, and approach issues \\"in a non-partisan manner to find common sense solutions to the challenges we face as our population ages and changes.\\" Guevara later tried, unsuccessfully, to attack Smith on the basis of her husband's salary, saying that she could afford to be supervisor full-time because he still needed to work another job to support his family. Smith was elected by a 52% to 48% margin over Guevara. Her commitment to community well-being and meeting residents' needs during her term included increasing public works budgets and appearing at casual events, such as a Pokémon Go event sponsored at a local park.  Election Run, 2019–2020  Smith ran for re-election and a second term in 2019. Her platform emphasized funding education, protecting the local environment, improving transportation and reducing commute times, and meeting the needs of a diverse Fairfax population. In a 2019 interview, Smith pointed out that \\"Our county government employees, county first responders, caregivers in the healthcare and education industries cannot live in the communities that they serve, protect, help, and educate. Our workers should have the opportunity to live in the area that they spend the most time in.\\" Her run for re-election was endorsed by several local organizations and unions. Ultimately, Smith won 62.85% of the vote, while her opponent, Republican Srilekha Palle, gained 36.88%. This victory was part of a larger Democratic win that secured several legislative majorities across Virginia.

The islands act as an ecological bridge between Borneo and the main islands of the Philippines, even though there were channels between the islands through the last ice age when sea levels were low. Biodiversity is high in the islands, with many endemic species, and with many genera shared with Borneo to the south. Pressure from logging is a concern for the forests of this region.  Location and description  In addition to the main island of Palawan Island, the ecoregion includes Balabac Island to the south, Ursula Island, and the Calamian Islands to the north. Palawan Island is 260 km long and averages only 25–30 km wide. A mountain range runs up the middle of the island, with almost half of the slopes averaging over 30 degrees. The highest point is at Mount Mantalingajan. The islands are relatively young, having been lifted up from the sea only 5-10 million years ago.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (Köppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month. In the Palawans, the wet season lasts from June to October. The dry season for much of the island is November to May, but only a few months long in the north.  Flora and fauna  About two thirds of the islands is covered in closed broadleaf evergreen forest, 10% in other closed forest, 15% in open forest or herbaceous cover and only about 5% in human settlement or agriculture. Much of this forest below the highlands has been cut previously, and pressure from logging and conversion of land to agriculture has reduced the quality of much of the forest. The forests nearest the coast are beech forests, transitioning to lowland rain forest dominated by trees of the Dipterocarpus family, Agalai, various species of Ficus, Water gum (Tristania), Broad leaved ballart (Exocarpos latifolius), and Swintonia foxworthyi. Montane rainforest is found at higher elevations (800 to 1,200 meters), and semi- deciduous forest is found in the rain shadow on the east side of the main island. The southern part of the main island has different forest types that depend on the soil. Large areas are limestone forest, featuring Cathedral cactus (Euphorbia trigona), (Aglaia argentea), Antidesma, Drypetes, Gomphandra. There are ultramafic forests around Victoria Peak that support plants that may be associated with soils having heavy metals. Parts of the southern forest are dominated by Casuarina. There are high levels of endemic species of mammals on the islands, but many of the genera are shared with Borneo, indicating that the Palawans were once part of Sundaland (the combined islands to the west), but have been separated for enough time to develop their own faunal communities.  Protected areas  Over 80% of the ecoregion is protected in some form.

Oregon Arts Watch contextualized the artistic works, stating that a \\"whitewashed pre- COVID lens\\" on American life, which obscured systemic racism, had been \\"cracked\\", and describing artists' response to racial violence being brought into the public eye was a \\"marathon, not a sprint\\". Artworks Murals on boarded windows of Apple Pioneer Place During local protests over the killing of George Floyd, many boarded windows, sidewalks, and other structures in downtown Portland were graffitied with chalk and paint, or covered by posters. According to Benjamin Brink of Street Roots, \\"Messaging range[d] from anti- police and anti-racist rhetoric to motivational quotes and support for Black lives\\". Many of the artworks depicted Floyd and other victims of police brutality in the U.S., or incorporated phrases associated with the Black Lives Matter movement such as \\"I can't breathe and \\"No justice, no peace\\". Some of the murals were added by local businesses. = Sculpture and performance art = The Thompson Elk sculpture, one of the most visible public artworks in Portland, located near frequent protests at the Multnomah County Justice Center, was removed for its protection. The elk has been used since as an antifascist symbol, perhaps most visibly in a sculpture dubbed \\"Nightmare Elk\\" erected in the Thompson Elk's place.

She started with one of George Floyd on June 1, 2020, and worked to recruit other artists and protesters to participate. A portrait of Ahmaud Arbery was added outside the store. In the Pioneer Place vicinity, portraits depicted Kendra James, Deontae J. Keller, and Jason Washington, all of whom were shot to death by Portland Police Bureau officers, as well as Tony McDade and Anton Sterling, who were killed by officers in Tallahassee and Baton Rouge, respectively. Portraits of Rayshard Brooks, Elijah McClain, and Breonna Taylor also appeared. Buckman neighborhood After someone tagged the Imago Dei nondenominational church in the Buckman neighborhood with the phrase \\"Black Lives Matter\\" on June 3, staff member and artist Heidie Ambrose converted the graffiti into a larger \\"vibrantly colored\\" mural. The names of Black people who \\"died at the hands of systemic racism... police brutality, racial injustice or white supremacy\\" were painted on individual bricks, including locals as well as Arbery, Martin Luther King Jr., Taylor, and Emmett Till. By August, the mural had become a memorial. The church's associate pastor Michelle Jones said: St. Johns neighborhood St. Johns (July 23, 2020) People writing text within the mural's yellow block letters On June 18, Nick Lloyd painted the phrase \\"Black Lives Matter\\" in large bright yellow block letters on North Edison Street in St. Johns. Inspired by Washington, D.C.'s Black Lives Matter Plaza, the mural spanned an entire block, and had \\"detailed historic facts about the treatment of minorities in Portland\\" written in smaller text within individual letters. The following text appeared within the letter \\"B\\": Written on the letter \\"A\\" was \\"1923 — This neighborhood is 100% white. Over 9,000 belong to the KKK.

A statement about when voters changed the Constitution of Oregon to eliminate the original ban on Black residents (2001) was written on one of the \\"T\\" letters, and another letter displayed the text \\"In 1988, PDX banks make only 9 mortgage loans in the district from Irvington to Woodlawn.\\" Lloyd did not seek permission to paint the mural, and city officials did not plan to remove the artwork, as of June 25. He said of his work: =Museum grant program= In August, local businessman and philanthropist Jordan Schnitzer announced a $150,000 Black Lives Matter grant program to award 60 artists in Oregon and Washington $2,500 each. The program is accepting proposals \\"for new work or projects, or recently created work directly responding to the current Black Lives Matter movement, responding to marginalized communities; experiences with systemic racism and inequality\\" until September 30, and grant recipients will be announced on October 31. Museums at Portland State University, University of Oregon, and Washington State University will each award 20 grants and display the newly created artworks upon reopening. In a press release, Schnitzer said, \\"I have often said artists are chroniclers of our time. We all feel anguish about the death of George Floyd and many others at the hands of racial oppression.

Based in Berlin, the ProVeg Incubator aims to give emerging entrepreneurs the tools to create, collaborate, grow, and scale. The incubator also provides co-working spaces and infrastructure, such as a commercial kitchen area equipped with specialised machinery, to facilitate research, product development, and small-scale production. * Smart Protein: In October 2019, ProVeg International was awarded funds to carry out Smart Protein, an EU-funded project including over 30 partners to develop commercially viable plant-based products from underutilised raw materials. From 2020 to 2024, ProVeg assesses markets for the Smart Protein targeted- proteins ingredients and food products by investigating consumer acceptance and trust towards innovative and new plant-based products. * Pandemic report: In 2020, ProVeg published a report stating that animal farming is the most dangerous artificial cause of pandemics. * Veggie Burger Ban: After the European agricultural commission adopted a proposal to prohibit meat and dairy names for plant-based alternatives (such as 'vegetarian sausage' and 'soy schnitzel', as these were allegedly 'confusing') in April 2019, ProVeg launched a petition to prevent this intended 'veggie burger ban'. According to Moleman, consumers want to know what they buy, and references to products they are already familiar with give customers 'relevant information about taste, texture and application that they can expect from a plant-based product'. Within three days, the petition received over 16,000 signatures. In December 2019, Dutch Medical Care Minister Bruno Bruins, as part of the 'Food Labelling Action Plan', decided that these 'meat names' would remain permissible in the Netherlands as long as it is clear to consumers that it is a vegetarian product; this meant that the meat industry was not given a monopoly on words such as 'burger, schnitzel and smoked sausage'. As of 15 October 2020, the petition has attracted over 150,000 signatures. * VegMed: ProVeg International hosts VegMed, an annual international medical congress on plant-based diet.

Description The Sundial is situated in the \\"Towers of the Virgin\\", west of Zion's park headquarters, towering 3,600-feet (1,100 meters) above the floor of Zion Canyon and the Virgin River which drains precipitation runoff from this mountain. Its nearest higher neighbor is The West Temple, one half mile to the southeast, and Altar of Sacrifice is set approximately one mile to the north-northeast. Other neighbors include The Witch Head, Bee Hive, The Sentinel, Mount Spry, Bridge Mountain, and Mount Kinesava. This geographical feature was named by the park's third superintendent, Preston P. Patraw, because it had long been used as a sundial to regulate clocks in the nearby town of Grafton. The Sundial's name was officially adopted in 1934 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit The Sundial.

Created in 1517, initially to reopen the University of Padua after the War of the League of Cambrai, they became responsible over time for public and private schooling at all levels, public libraries in Venice and Padua, intellectual academies, and professional schools. They also reviewed and authorized for publication all books within the mainland territory of Venice.  Origins  The University of Padua, founded in 1222, came under the jurisdiction of Venice when Padua was annexed to the Venetian Republic in 1405. Administration of the university, previously exercised by the nationes, relatively autonomous groups of students organized according to national origins, fell increasingly to the rettore, a Venetian nobleman nominated by the government to administer the city of Padua as a part of the mainland territories of the Republic.Tiepolo, 'Venezia', p. 977 Classes were suspended in 1509 and the teachers and students dispersed as a result of the War of the League of Cambrai when Padua was briefly conquered by the troops of the Holy Roman Empire before being retaken by Venice. On 21 February 1517 (Venetian year 1516), the Venetian Senate tasked the Full College, the executive organ of the Republic, with reopening the University of Padua. This involved repairing physical damage to the buildings, hiring new professors, and organizing courses. For this purpose, three nobles were chosen with the title of riformatori dello studio di Padova. Successive legislation on 22 September and 17 October 1528 established the riformatori as a permanent committee of the senate, responsible for education matters.  Election  From 1517 until 1527, the nomination of the riformatori was delegated to the Consulta dei Savi del Collegio, composed of the Savi Grandi, the Savi di Terraferma, and the Savi agli Ordini. When the office was made permanent in 1528, the riformatori were designated as a magistratura senatoriale (senatorial magistracy), a standing subcommittee of the senate. They were henceforth elected by the senate from among its own members.Besta, Il senato veneziano..., p. 73 In 1553, a deliberation of the senate divided the senatorial magistracies between aperte (open) and serrate (closed); members of the latter could not be elected to an alternative office prior to the completion of their term. The objective was to ensure that magistrates dealing with more complex or critical matters had sufficient time to gain practical experience.Besta, Il senato veneziano..., pp. 164–165 Although the riformatori dello studio di Padova were initially designated as a closed magistracy, beginning in 1625 they were no longer required to serve the entire term of office if they were elected to an alternative closed magistracy. Laws in 1648 and 1674 designated the riformatori as sopranumerari (supernumerary), allowing the office to be held simultaneously with a closed magistracy.Besta, Il senato veneziano..., p. 167 Ultimately, the law of 22 April 1731 established the riformatori as a magistratura privilegiata (privileged magistracy): the office was compatible with any other magistracy and could be held together with one closed magistracy and, at the same time, with one or more open or supernumerary magistracies.Besta, Il senato veneziano..., p. 168  Functions  The role of the riformatori was progressively expanded beyond the original task of reopening the university, up to and including the right to preside over the university, effectively replacing the Venetian rector of Padua in his supervisory functions. The riformatori determined the number of official chairs for professors and of lectureships for teachers, hired professors and lectors, and fixed salaries. They determined teaching methods, authorized texts for readings, established the hours of classes, and prevented university professors from teaching privately.Da Mosto, L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia..., p. 217 Although they were initially advised by the consiliarii, elected by the nationes of students, all decisions regarding the faculty and the curriculum were assigned directly to the riformatori in 1560 when the elected offices within the university were abolished. With the exception of religious seminaries and the military college of Verona, all private and public schools within the territory of the Republic of Venice came under their jurisdication, as did all scientific, literary, and artistic academies.Cappelletti, Relazione storica sulle magistrature venete, p. 111 They were additionally responsible for censorship which involved reviewing and authorizing all books for publication and preventing the importation of forbidden works. In 1544 the riformatori were also charged with overseeing the Public Library of Saint Mark in Venice.Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 111 The election of the librarian was delegated by the senate to the riformatori in 1558, but in 1626 the responsibility was attributed once again to the whole senate.Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., pp. 119, 173, and 211 With regard to the official state historian, the riformatori were required to review his progress every two years and present their findings to the three chiefs of the Council of Ten who were ultimately responsible for determining the suitability of the writings.Da Mosto, L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia..., pp. 217–218  Authority  As a senatorial magistracy, the riformatori dello studio di Padova had the right to propose legislation in the senate concerning those matters that fell under their purview. But they did not have authority to independently judge cases involving the transgression of the laws and norms that regulated educational matters and academic life. Such cases were raised by the riformatori to the Council of Ten which had jurisdiction.Milan, Politi, and Vianello, Guida alle magistrature, p. 100  Notes and References   Bibliography  * Besta, Enrico, Il senato veneziano: origine, costituzione, attribuzioni e riti (Venezia: Regia deputazione veneta di storia patria, 1899) * Cappelletti, Giuseppe, Relazione storica sulle magistrature venete (Venezia: Filippi Editore, 1873) * Da Mosto, Andrea, L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia, indice generale, storico, descrittivo ed analitico (Roma: Biblioteca d'Arte editrice, 1937) * Milan, Catia, Antonio Politi, and Bruno Vianello, Guida alle magistrature: elementi per la conoscenza della Repubblica veneta (Sommacampagna: Cierre, 2003) * Tiepolo, Maria Francesca, 'Venezia', in La Guida generale degli Archivi di Stato, IV (Roma: Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali, Ufficio centrale per i beni archivistici, 1994), pp. 857–1014, 1062–1070, 1076–1140 * Zorzi, Marino, La libreria di san Marco: libri, lettori, società nella Venezia dei dogi (Milano: Mondadori, 1987) Category:Government of the Republic of Venice Category:Culture of the Republic of Venice Category:History of education in Italy Category:University of Padua ","title":"Riformatori dello studio di Padova"},{"id":"65284877","text":"Wilhelm Christian Raster was a German administrative officer (Verwaltungsbeamter) in the Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau in the first half of the 19th century.

After leaving school, he trained as a drama teacher and then worked on a community arts project in Liverpool. While in the city he developed a comedy act which he would perform at street parties and events and then developed it to become a street entertainer, at first in London's Covent Garden.Paul Mackenzie,\\"Photographer profile - JJ Waller\\", Lancashire Life, 27 December 2019 Billed as \\"Captain JJ Waller Unusualist\\"JJ Waller Collection, University of Kent's Special Collections and Archives he became a \\"leading figure in developing a new wave of street entertainment\\". Gaynor Wetherall,\\"Life behind the Lens\\", Sussex Style magazine, 9 December 2013 The University of Kent's British Comedy Archive includes a JJ Waller Collection, where a flyer describes his act as including \\"Eating a Live Human Being\\" and an escapology routine, in which \\"suspended from the ceiling in a straight jacket singing \\"My Way\\" JJ escapes from the jacket and jumps head first into an egg without breaking the yolk.\\" The collection also has a photograph of another act, \\"'The Bed of Nails' where JJ balanced two London double-decker buses whilst lying on a bed of nails.\\" Waller also features in a podcast from the Comedy Archive, including an interview in which he describes his 1980s performances.\\"Captain JJ Waller's Publicity Shot\\", episode 10 of Dr Oliver Double's History of Comedy in Several Objects podcast, from the University of Kent, 17 May 2017 Waller spent most of the 1980s working as an act in comedy clubs. He then joined the French circus Archaos, as front-of-house manager, until the company's tent was destroyed by a gale in Dublin in 1991. Asked if he missed performance, Waller said, \\"As a photographer it's quite a crossover – you need to respond to events taking place around you....Sometimes I become like a director working on a performance, getting everyone and everything into place, and then it's lights, cameras, action.\\" Photography In the 1990s, Waller reinvented himself as a photographer. After taking an evening class in photography, his tutor, Mark Power, suggested that Waller study for a degree in editorial photography at the University of Brighton. After finishing his degree, Waller spent twelve months as Artist in Residence at Gatwick Airport.Who's Waller, biography on JJ Waller's website He then toured the world as assistant to Magnum photographer Paul Lowe. Waller subsequently spent a number of years as a photography producer in the advertising industry. JJ Waller's Brighton In 2014, Waller published his first book, JJ Waller's Brighton Volume 1. In his introduction to JJ Waller's Brighton Volume 2, Mark Power wrote that, while Waller revelled in exotic events, such as the Brighton Pride and Naked Bike Ride, \\"many of the best pictures in this book are of nothing much at all...they are just well seen...Picture after picture provokes a chuckle. Who would have thought the rebuilding of the Seven Dials roundabout could make such a witty picture, so neat and tidy but for the single anarchic orange bollard that's fallen out of line?\\"Mark Power, JJ Waller's Brighton Volume 3, Curious Publishing, 2014 Jonathan Meades provided a testimonial for Volume 3: \\"Waller shows us the horror of Brighton. Not the moral horror of Greene and Hamilton but the aesthetic horror of people desperately having fun: garish, trashy, gross, terminally uncool, and a delight for our basest senses.\\" St Leonards on Sea In 2007, Waller began to document St Leonards on Sea, looking at its regeneration. He told Sussex Style magazine, \\"A large part of the project is all about migration, which is at the core of St Leonards...Like most British seaside resorts so much has changed over the years and during the seventies, hotels and buildings were chopped into bedsits and the GLC built homes for 7,000 people to help them migrate to this part of the world.\\" Apart from his 2014 book, JJ Waller's St. Leonards-on-Sea & Hastings Vol 1, his St Leonards work was produced as wallpaper in a collaboration with artist Deborah Bowness. This work can be seen on permanent exhibition at The Saint Leonard. The Bohemians a series of portraits of people living and working in the area of St Leonards named Bohemia, was exhibited as an installation at the Bohemia club in 2016. Whitehawk In 2014, Waller was commissioned to document Whitehawk Football Club, when they played their first season in the Conference South. He told Brighton's Viva magazine, \\"I soon became a fan, and I've been going ever since. While I care passionately about the results, I'm still there to take pictures, and unlike most other football photographers, I'm more interested in the fans than the action....In a way it's like being embedded: people know me so well, they don't notice me.\\"Alex Leith, 'JJ Waller Fan photographer', Viva Magazine, June 2019,p.33 Blackpool and Benidorm In 2017, Waller made several trips to Blackpool, which resulted in JJ Waller;'s Blackpool Volume 1. Waller told Lancashire Life that following a commission to spend a week taking photographs in Blackpool, he fell in love with the place. \\"It's often a case of waiting for something to happen but you don't usually have to wait long in Blackpool - it doesn't usually take long for something interesting to come along. Blackpool is out on a limb but it's a wonderful place. I like places that are on the edge. Blackpool is on the edge geographically, but in other ways as well.\\" After photographing Blackpool, Waller decided to photograph the British abroad, in Benidorm in Spain. In June 2017, Viva Brighton magazine had a feature on Waller's Benidorm photographs, in which he explained, \\"It carries on the continuity of the British on holiday. The package holidays of the 60s changed the Brit holiday experience forever. Benidorm seemed the logical place to carry on my picture story...It's like Blackpool with sun. There's a whole area called the British Square that offers loads of picture opportunities.\\"Lizzie Lower, 'JJ Waller: People watching in Benidorm', Viva Brighton, June 2017, pages 25-29 Brighton and Hove Albion JJ Waller's Brighton & Hove Albion, 2017, documented the history of the football club. In his introduction, Paul Hodson, author of We Want Falmer, described the book as \\"a collection of exceptional images from some significant moments since the Goldstone's destruction to the astonishing parade along Brighton and Hove seafront to celebrate the club's Premier League promotion.\\"JJ Waller's Brighton and Hove Albion, Curious, 2017 The back cover carried a testimonial from Dick Knight, widely regarded as saviour of the club, in which he described the pictures as \\"extraordinary, adding more drama, vision, insight, hope and joy to scenes we've already seen, making us relive them from new perspectives.\\" Sussex Bonfires In November 2018, Waller documented Bonfire Night across Sussex. Rather than photographing the celebration itself, he made before and after images of the bonfires. He told Viva Lewes, which published a feature on the photos, \\"I see an intrinsic sculptural beauty in these bonfires. I am fascinated by their transient nature, a form of unremarked folk art. The structures are simple but skilfully assembled. I have great respect for the bonfire captains who make them: creations whose sole destinies are to be reduced to ash. Very often it is the fireworks and effigies that take the public gaze, but the bonfire is at the core of the event.\\"'Lewes Bonfire, the morning after', Viva Lewes, November 2019, pp36-37 Waller also produced a poster of 32 Sussex bonfires, which came in a facsimile firework tube with a blue touch paper.Sussex Bonfire Poster on jjwaller.com JJ Waller's Brighton Pride Waller regularly photographed his city's Pride festival, which featured in all his Brighton books. In 2018, he decided to publish a separate book on the festival, inspired by that year's Britney Spears concert, a massive ticketed event, attended by 55,000 people.Thomas Barnes, 'Brighton Pride park crush leaves fans scared after thousands flock to see Britney Spears', The Independent, 6 August 2018 He told Sussex Life magazine that, while photographing the crowds at the show, \\"I knew I had a story – I had pictures from the early Pride parades up to the present day incarnation.\\"Duncan Hall, 'Brighton Pride Photographer', Sussex Life, 1 August 2019. His 2019 book, JJ Waller's Brighton Pride, included comments from those involved in the festival, both celebratory and critical. Caroline Lucas, Brighton Pavilion's Green MP, said, \\"Brighton Pride is one of the most important events in the city, and in this book JJ Waller brilliantly captures its spirit – one that is unashamedly bold, full of colour, and one that unites us by celebrating our uniqueness and humanity.\\"JJ Waller's Pride, Curious, 2019 There was a quotation from George Montague, aged 96, shown in the book parading under his banner, 'The Oldest Gay in the Village': \\"Pride does more than anything else to further the acceptance of homosexuality and the understanding of just how many of us there are.\\" Hannah Cowan social anthropologist, was also quoted: \\"Brighton Pride has been pinkwashed with capitalist sentiments and become an opportunity for business to make money. In doing so they have taken away the meaning of the day, and worked to increase demand through advertising campaigns reminiscent of music festivals.\\" JJ Waller's Lockdown From March until May 2020, Waller made around 100 informal portraits of people isolated in their homes during the Covid Lockdown. The photographs, taken in Brighton and Hove, St Leonards, Hastings and Firle were almost all shot through windows. His subjects included \\"a woman holding her newborn baby against the pane of her door, a crouching couple peering out from the front of their house, and an entire family posing in the colours of a local non-league football team.\\" At the beginning of April, Waller told the Guardian, \\"Since the lockdown started to kick in three weeks ago I have had 24 different invites to homes across Brighton. They saw a post I put up across social media about this project and all are very happy to take part.Technically it is a real challenge because I only get maybe a few minutes to shoot individuals and families who come to the windows or doors. But I am also honoured that I have their trust to do this.\\" Martin Parr edited a book, JJ Waller's Lockdown: Informal Portraits of this Time, published in September 2020. Parr wrote, \\"When we look back at the spring and summer of 2020, I think this suit of images will be an iconic memory of this strange time we have all lived through.\\"\\"JJ Waller’s Lockdown: Informal Portraits of This Time\\", Hastings Independent, 17 July 2020 The book included text from Jonathan Meades in which he compared the images with a memory of a newborn calf \\"peering through the semi-transparent foetal membrane at the incomprehensible world it would inhabit....People gazing through translucent but far from transparent glass recall that calf. They are half seeing an uncertain contorted world which they don't fully understand and which they have reason to be fearful of....Waller's photographs show an entire captive nation, not merely a city on its edge.\\"Jonathan Meades, JJ Waller's Lockdown, Curious Publishing 2020 Books *JJ Waller's Brighton.

He is the third black dancer to be a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. Early life and training Royal is from Tampa, Florida. He first studied in piano, and had appeared in a local dance show titled The Chocolate Nutcracker. At age 14, he was recommended to audition for Pinellas County Center for the Arts at Gibbs High School's dance program and was accepted despite his lack of dance training. When he was 17, he competed at the Youth America Grand Prix \\"just hoping to get feedback\\". However, he received a scholarship to the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School in New York City. Career Royal joined ABT II, American Ballet Theatre's second company in 2007, became an apprentice with the main company in 2010, a corps de ballet member in 2011, and soloist in 2017. In 2019, Royal and Misty Copeland became the first black duo in ABT to dance the lead roles in a ballet, by performing Ratmansky's restaging of Harlequinade. Later that year, on his debut as the title role in Balanchine's Apollo, the New York Times wrote that he \\"is suddenly the most elegant male dancer in the company\\". In 2020, though his debuts as the lead roles in Giselle and MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet were delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, he was promoted to principal dancer, making him the third black person to reach this rank, after Desmond Richardson and Copeland. In 2017, Royal performed a pas de deux Balanchine's Agon with New York City Ballet soloist Unity Phelan, with Arthur Mitchell, who originated Royal's role and the first African American dancer with NYCB, in the audience. Mitchell commented the ballet was \\"in good hands\\", and later said \\"If they ever did a film of a young me, it would be Calvin.\\" The following year, after Mitchell's death, Royal and Phelan reprised the Agon pas de deux at his memorial. Royal had been a frequent performer at the Vail Dance Festival since 2015. He was named artist-in-residence of the festival in 2020. Royal was also handpicked by Copeland to be her partner in performances outside of the company. Personal life Royal is openly gay. He studied at the Long Island University when he was in ABT II and an ABT apprentice, but withdrew when he joined the corps de ballet due to his schedule. He resumed his study through Saint Mary's College of California's LEAP program in 2018 after he became a soloist.

She was a leader in the Bristol Women's Liberal Association where she campaigned for women's rights including by electoral reform. University College in Bristol was founded in 1876, although it was not recognised as a university until 1909. The University College arranged lectures that women including the Sturge sisters could attend. She and Elizabeth were involved in the creation of Redland High School for Girls which opened in 1882. They both served as governors. She was a suffragist and became secretary of the west of England branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1878 after being a member since 1872 and the society members were regular visitors at her home. The society had been formed only a few years before at Matthew Davenport Hill's house. Sturge died in Cotham in 1892 after falling from a horse. An obituary was written by her aunt Matilda Sturge. In 2018 blue plaques were unveiled commemorating Emily, her sister Elizabeth Sturge and Agnes Beddoe. The plaques would be on Redmaids' High School and on Redland High School even though that building is no longer a school.

She is a faculty member at the Universidad del Valle de Atemajac in Zapopan. Ortiz is known for developing a non-toxic, renewable, and biodegradable plastic alternative made from cactus juice. Education and career Ortiz finished Engineering from the University of Guadalajara in August 1995. She obtained a degree in Biotechnology from the same university in August 1999. She began teaching at the Universidad del Valle de Atemajac in January 2002. In January 2011, she was promoted as a research professor and has been working on sustainable development and innovation projects since. Eco-friendly plastic alternative In 2013, Ortiz began researching on using nopal cactus as a base for plastic with a few students. There was a lack of support from the international community—thereby an insufficiency with equipment, materials and interest from fellow scientists—so the study was eventually abandoned. She later continued the project with a new set of students. Ortiz found out that the cacti is composed of the same sugars and gums that make up the creation of biopolymer substances, which are the building blocks of plastic itself. They initially used the most common cacti variety in Mexican cuisine: opuntia ficus indica, and then switched to opuntia megacantha. The juice of the cacti is extracted and mixed with glycerine, proteins, natural waxes and colorants; then it is laminated and left to dry. The finished product is very malleable, leaving Ortiz to extend the research to the manufacture of a wider range of products. Unlike the manufacture of plastic, the process does not require crude oil, as its mining has caused much flak from environmentalists. It is also carbon neutral, as the carbon it emitted upon degradation is equal to what it took in upon its growth. The bioplastic made from prickly pear cacti is renewable—as few leaves are taken from the plant thereby allowing it to regenerate, rather than regrow from seed to adulthood like most upon utilization. It is also non-toxic and safe to ingest both for animals and humans alike. The bioplastic degrades after 2–3 months and 7 days if immersed in water. The process is done exclusively in Ortiz's lab. She is experimenting with 300 species of nopal plant native in Mexico and is exploring the use of cacti in toys, bags, and other plastic products for wide-scale commercial use.

It was also distributed in the United States under the titles What Is Seen Through a Keyhole and What Happened to the Inquisitive Janitor, and in the United Kingdom under the titles What Happened: The Inquisitive Janitor and Peeping Tom. Review and link to watch the film: Plot A hotel porter finds out the secrets of the guests by looking through the keyholes of four different rooms: * in the first one he sees a woman combing her hair, * in the second, what looked like a woman removes her whig and false breasts, revealing that she was in fact a transvestite, * in the third, a man drinks champagne with a woman sitting on his lap, * finally the door of the fourth room opens while he is watching and the furious guest kicks him down the stairs. Analysis right After being hired by Charles Pathé as main film director of the recently created film production company Pathé Frères, Zecca convinced Pathé to produce in addition to documentaries other genres of films, notably comedy films such as this one but also crime films, like Histoire d'un crime (1901), or religious subjects, like La vie et la passion du Christ (1903). He also introduced in France innovations with respect to cinematographic style. Par le trou de la serrure is the first French film featuring editing in order to combine wide shots and medium close-up point of view shots. Zecca was clearly influenced by George Albert Smith who had used for the first time these innovations in 1900 in his short films Grandma's Reading Glass and As Seen Through a Telescope.Georges Sadoul and Yvonne Templin, Early Film Production in England: The Origin of Montage, Close-Ups, and Chase Sequence, Hollywood Quarterly, Apr., 1946, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Apr., 1946), University of California Press, pp. 249-259 Par le trou de la serrure is also characteristic of a certain voyeuristic trend in early cinema in showing what was normally hidden in a hotel room. The film was judged by some, notably Georges Méliès's granddaughter, as being of dubious taste.Madeleine Malthête-Méliès, Méliès et la naissance du spectacle cinématographique, Klincksieck, 1984, p.130. Distribution Par le trou de la serrure was distributed by Pathé Frères in 1901 in France, and in 1902 in the United States.

Sunder takes her to his living place, which is an abandoned railway carriage which is near railway tracks. There she is introduced to Dr. Nirogi (Om Prakash), who was once a magician and showman, was thrown out of work and now lives with Sunder. There is Mohan (Sajjan), who is currently unemployed. Mohan tells her that he has came to Sunder's house just like Chanda was brought there. All four become friends and the carriage becomes a place of happiness for them. They share food and try to earn living by different means-not for themselves but for each other. While Sunder, Nirogi and Chanda are still trying to find ways to make ends meet, Mohan arrives with good news that the newspaper Prakash Daily has hired him, at the sum of Rs 300 per month. And Mohan has bought gifts for his friends with the advance he's received. To celebrate these happy times, they go out for a walk near a beach. In the evening when Nirogi and Mohan are out for some work, Chanda and Sunder realize that they are in love. Both of them marry soon but don't tell anything to their friends. One day, Mohan tells Chanda that he is in love with her and wants to marry her. A horrified Chanda reveals that she is already married to Sunder, and the result is Mohan begins fighting and abusing Sunder. Soon this verbal fight turns into a physical fight, with Chanda, in vain, trying to stop the men. Soon Sunder knocks Mohan out and drags him to the railway track. What will happen now ? Will these four unite again ?

Cows are killed for the purpose of obtaining beef. The proposals on banning cattle slaughter were initiated in the past by pressure groups and politicians but the legislation to restrict cattle slaughter was not materialised and passed by any of the previous governments. The call for eradicating cattle slaughter was put forward by the Sinhala Buddhist groups in the past. In September 2020, a proposal was initiated to ban cattle slaughter. On 29 September 2020, the government revealed that the cattle slaughter would be officially banned after the implementation of scheme. The move was deemed primarily due to the influence of majority Buddhist population. However government ruled out the religious impact and insisted that the cattle slaughter ban is to encourage agriculture in the country.  Act  The Animal Act of Sri Lanka was historically passed in the parliament in 1958 which largely restricts the slaughter of cattle, cows and calves below the age of 12. The Animal Act of 1958 was later amended in 1964 with minor changes and modifications. The Cattle slaughter Ordinance no 9 of 1893 also has provisions about animal slaughter.  Timeline  In 2009, Member of Parliament, Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa presented his proposal in the parliament calling for a whole ban on cattle slaughter. He insisted that banning cattle slaughter would help to generate more employment opportunities for people in the diary industry. However the government didn't approve the proposal at that time. In September 2012, the Kandy Municipal Council passed a resolution unanimously to ban cattle slaughter within the boundaries of Kandy municipal area. The issue regarding cattle slaughter became a matter of concern in 2013 when a Buddhist monk set himself on fire after observing a Muslim man eating beef. In the same year, Sinhala Buddhist groups Sinhala Ravaya and Bodu Bala Sena launched awareness campaigns and protests demanding to stop selling meat under Halal certification. In 2018, a Hindu right-wing group called Siva Senai held a protest in Jaffna against cattle slaughter. On 8 September 2020, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa proposed the ban on cattle slaughter which he previously recommended in 2016. On the same day, his proposal was approved by the Parliamentary group of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna with the support of all SLPP MPs. The move was also welcomed by Buddhists and Hindus inline with the cultural values. On 10 September 2020, the cabinet spokesman of SLPP Keheliya Rambukwella confirmed that the ban on cattle slaughter was postponed to October 2020. On 29 September 2020, the cabinet approved the proposal on banning cattle slaughter permanently from the country.

He researches Marxist history and the history of Germanic-speaking Europe. Biography Shami Ghosh was born in India. He received his BA (2003) in German at King's College London in 2003, and his MA (2005), PhD (2010) and LMS (2016) in Medieval Studies from the University of Toronto. Since 2016, Ghosh is Associate Professor at the Centre for Medieval Studies and Department of History at the University of Toronto. Theories The research of Ghosh centers on Marxist history and the history of Germanic-speaking Europe. He has published the monographs Kings' Sagas and Norwegian History (2011) and Writing The Barbarian Past (2015). In the latter monograph, Ghosh argues that the only thing early Germanic peoples had in common was speaking Germanic languages, but that these linguistic similarities are insignificant. He denies that early Germanic peoples shared a common culture or identity, and believes that they only shared cultural similarities because mutual intelligibility facilitated cultural exchanges between them.. \\"A central component of his argument throughout the book is the denial of anything that approaches a common Germanic culture or identity... Ghosh repeatedly downplays the significance of the Germanic languages... He views language as merely the means through which oral narratives circulated from one people to another... To this reader, at least, it seems that he concedes much of what constituted what some of us would call a common Germanic culture.\\". \\"The works studied in his monograph relate historical matter pertaining to peoples who spoke Germanic languages, and these works have traditionally been valued for their preservation of Germanic lore and legend, but Ghosh prefers to characterize the past represented in them as \\"barbarian\\" rather than \\"Germanic.\\"... Since these works are preserved in Germanic vernaculars, Ghosh entertains no doubts about their content deriving from Germanic oral traditions. Yet the anti-Germanic thread of his book is continued... [T]he fact that medieval Germanic peoples told stories about other, distant Germanic peoples does not, according to Ghosh, reflect identification with those peoples or any perception of ethnic similarity. It is solely a matter of linguistic convenience... Ghosh’s anti- Germanic arguments are often plausible... It is doubtful, however, whether his arguments will have much of an impact... One must wonder whether any adjectives used to describe cultural phenomena in medieval studies (e.g., Celtic, Romance, Byzantine, Carolingian) could withstand the kind of scrutiny that Ghosh has applied to the term \\"Germanic.\\" The term will doubtless continue to be used because it is useful... If \\"Germanic\\" is to be abandoned because Germanic tradition contains non-Germanic elements, then all of the other ethno-linguistic adjectives employed in medieval studies must surely be scrapped as well.... Despite Ghosh’s claims to the contrary, the negative fixation on the term \\"Germanic\\" among medieval historians such as himself still appears to be \\"a matter of the ideological baggage it carries\\"... Although Ghosh’s predilection for anti-Germanic readings occasionally entangles him in improbabilities, Writing the Barbarian Past remains an excellent introduction to the principal early medieval sources for Germanic legend...\\" Ghosh advocates replacing the term \\"Germanic\\" with the term \\"barbarian\\". Leonard Neidorf has described the theories of Ghosh on Germanic peoples as anti-Germanic.

After the death of Thomas Overbury in 1613, Rumler was questioned and testified that his brother-in-law Paul de l'Obel (1570-1621) had been appointed to make physic for Théodore de Mayerne because he lived on Lime Street near the Tower of London, at Mayerne's suggestion, and he had not recommended Paul L'Obel to the king for Overbury's physic.Mary Anne Everett Green, Calendar of State Papers Domestic James I: 1611-1618, vol. 2 (London, 1858), p. 313, TNA SP14/82 f.42.

A bystander called Gilbert Tonckes joined in and criticised hospitality in Scotland, where it was thought there were few inns offering hospitality on the English model. Chambers and Rumler, as servants of the Scottish King James took exception to this. The argument was renewed in the evening.
