Just one block north of Portage and Main, the Exchange District comprises twenty city blocks and approximately 150 heritage buildings, and it is known for its intact early 20th century collection of warehouses, financial institutions, and early terra cotta clad skyscrapers. The Exchange is home to the Manitoba Museum as well as the Planetarium and a Science Gallery. The Exchange District spans two distinct areas, the East Exchange and the West Exchange. The east Exchange area is located between the Disraeli Bridge, Waterfront Drive, William Stephenson Way and Main Street, and the West Exchange is bounded by Adelaide Street, Ross Avenue, Notre Dame Avenue and Main Street.  History  Entrance to the Grain Exchange building at 167 Lombard Ave The Exchange District‚Äôs name originates from the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, the former centre of the grain industry in Canada, as well as other commodity exchanges which developed in Winnipeg between 1881‚Äì1918, some of which are still active today. (see Winnipeg Commodity Exchange) Winnipeg was one of the fastest growing cities in North America around the turn of the 20th century. The city became known as the Chicago of the North. Much of Winnipeg‚Äôs remaining architecture of the late 1800s and early 1900s is heavily influenced by the Chicago style. By 1911, Winnipeg had become the third largest city in Canada. At the time it had more than two dozen rail lines converging near the city centre along with over 200 wholesale businesses. World War I and the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 slowed Winnipeg's growth, as there was a new route for shipping goods from Eastern Canada and Europe to Western Canada and from East Asia to the larger markets on the Eastern seaboard. As wholesale operations began to open in other Western Canadian cities, such as Edmonton, Moose Jaw, and Regina, Winnipeg's importance as a wholesale centre declined in the 1910s and 1920s. By the 1940s, many of the warehouses in the Exchange District had been converted into uses related to the garment trade. As Winnipeg began to experience growth in the years following World War II, much of Winnipeg‚Äôs downtown development shifted to the area of downtown south of Portage Avenue, particularly along Broadway and on towards Osborne Village. The lack of new development, mixed with the existing demand for inexpensive wholesaling and manufacturing space, left the Exchange District largely intact. As a result, Winnipeg today has one of the most historically intact early 20th century commercial districts in North America. In the early 1980s the streetscaping in the area was improved with the creation of wider sidewalks, historically appropriate street furniture, lighting, and decorative paving patterns and materials. On September 27, 1997, the Winnipeg Exchange District was declared a National Historic Site by then federal Minister of Canadian Heritage, Sheila Copps.  Attractions  The Exchange District today thrives as one of Winnipeg's commercial and cultural centers, as home to an array of specialty retailers, restaurants, nightclubs, art galleries, wholesalers, and condos. =Theatres= Winnipeg's theatre district is located on the east side of the Exchange District, home to the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, and Centennial Concert Hall which houses the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and the Manitoba Opera. The west side of the Exchange is home to Cinematheque, a small movie theatre located on the main floor of the Artspace building on Albert Street. =Education= Red River College's Roblin Centre Red River College's Roblin Centre is a building that features the original fa√ßades along Princess Street, and incorporates modern green building technology. The Roblin Centre's construction merged five prominent heritage buildings on Princess Street as well as a 1905 warehouse on William Avenue. It is home to approximately 200 staff and 2,000 students. The Centre has a focus on modern media, information technology, and business. The Paterson Globalfoods Institute is a new addition to Red River College's Exchange District Campus as of 2013. The Institute is located at the Union Bank Building, an 11 storey building that dates back to 1903, and is the home of the Culinary Arts, Hospitality and Tourism Management and Professional Baking and Patisserie programs. =Old Market Square= Winnipeg Fringe Festival at the Cube in Old Market Square Old Market Square hosts the annual Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and the Manitoba Electronic Music Exhibition. Its cobblestone streets and friendly pedestrian environment also contribute to The Exchange District's popularity as a period backdrop for the movie industry. Most notably the 2006 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Brad Pitt, and the 2006 film The Lookout starring Jeff Daniels. Old Market Square originated in 1889, initially as a public market building. Originally located on the site of what is now the Public Safety Building, it was the centre of Winnipeg's early commercial trade. In 1964 to 1965, the original building as well as several nearby structures were razed to make room for the current Civic Centre. In 1970, an \\"Old Market Square Association\\" was created to lobby for the preservation and improvement of the site. In 1976, the national historic trust, Heritage Canada, announced a $500,000 grant to towards the purchase and restoration of significant buildings in the Old Market Square area, with a focus on Albert Street and what was then known as \\"Albert Street Park\\". The park became the venue for a farmer's market which brought momentum to the rejuvenation of the area. In 1990, a permanent stage was built in the park. Begun in 2008 and completed in 2012, a revitalization program began that improved landscaping, drainage, sod and lighting. Developed by Scatliff+Miller+Murray, the new area features a performance space, a sunken event lawn, serpentine seating wall and seating planters encircling elm trees. The focal point of the renovation was \\"The Cube\\", a new $1.5 million stage, with a skin made up of 20,000 aluminum links. Designed by 5468796 Architecture, the stage contains a built-in lighting system, green room and two performance levels, and was funded by the Winnipeg Foundation, CentreVenture and several levels of government. The by cube is composed of a flexible curtain of diamond extrusions strung together. The curtain can be drawn back to reveal the stage within. The cube has not functioned properly since it was opened in 2010. In summer 2012, the Cube was closed due to concerns about supports for the metal curtain. Repairs for the structure are planned for the spring of 2013 and are expected to include fixes for faulty lights and cooling fans, additional railings and handrails, alterations to the rear of the stage and accessibility improvements. Plans are underway to redevelop the site of the former Public Safety Building and Parkade (c. 1966). CentreVenture is in charge of choosing the design of Marketlands, featuring a farmers market and residential component. Demolition of the PSB will take place starting in the fall of 2019.  Transportation  = Roads = There are no high speed roads that pass through or near the Exchange District. Regular urban speed limits are observed on Portage Avenue, Main Street on the boundaries of the area. = Cycling = There is a painted cycling lane along McDermot Ave. between Main St. and the HSC campus. = Transit = Several transit routes travel through the Exchange District: 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 32, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. = Boat = At one time the Alexander Docks functioned as an urban dock in downtown Winnipeg which tourist riverboat the Paddlewheel Queen and others had used for decades. This has since been shut down and is in the process of being updated. Proposals = Albert St. Pedestrian Mall = Albert Street, in the Exchange District A pedestrian mall was proposed for the area in August 2010 by local architect Brent Bellamy. The proposed pedestrian mall would be located along two blocks of Albert Street to the Old Market Square and closed to automobile traffic. The hope of the mall would be to accentuate the uniqueness of the neighbourhood, attract workers from Portage and Main, and be sustained over the long-term with residential development in the area. = Centennial Centre = As the Centennial Centre area (Concert Hall, Manitoba Theatre Centre, Museum and Planetarium) are now over 50 years of age, there is a plan to upgrade and expand the venues. = Alexander Docks = The city had issued an RFP in 2007 to redevelop the Alexander Docks site, which had been built by the Federal government in 1929. Liberal Senator Rod Zimmer won the bidding process thru his proposed $10 million development plan which would include a boutique hotel (restaurant, meeting space) and marina. A consortium comprising CentreVenture, the Manitoba Association of Architects, The Forks, the Exchange District BIZ, as well as several architectural firms held an international design competition, On the Docks, in 2018 for the redevelopment of Alexander Docks. Over 200 designs were entered. The winner of the design competition was Cornoiu Sabin of Romania for his \\"Alexander's Garden\\".  Demographics  According to the 2016 census, the Exchange District has approximately 0.10% of Winnipeg's population with 630 people (+41.6%), up from 445 at the time of the 2011 census. The Exchange District makes up 0.1% of the city's total land area. The district's population age is wide between early twenties and up; there is no dominant age group of residents. The district has a lower proportion of visible minorities, with only 13.5%, as compared to 28% for the whole of Winnipeg. Over 30.6% of respondents in the district reported as \\"Never married (single)\\", as compared to 31.4% of Winnipeg. The district lends itself to pedestrian travel: over 44.3% of employed respondents stated walking as their primary mode of transportation, significantly higher than the 4.9% reported for the entire city. The average employment income in the Exchange District is $79,831, as compared to $61,164 for Winnipeg as a whole.

The company was based in Cayce, South Carolina, a suburb of Columbia, South Carolina. The company operated 4 hydroelectric plants, 1 pumped-storage hydroelectricity plant, 4 coal fossil fuel power station, the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station, 1 combined cycle power plant, 1 \\"re-powered\\" formerly coal-fired plant with a natural gas-powered steam unit and two combined cycle units, and 16 simple cycle combustion turbines. The total output was over 5,800 MW. The corporate name SCANA is not an acronym, but is taken from the letters in South Carolina (S []-C-A-[roli] N-A). In January 2019, the company was acquired by Dominion Energy. Divisions SCE&G; (South Carolina Electric & Gas Company) was engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 719,000 customers in a service area encompassing approximately in 24 counties of South Carolina and the purchase, sale and transportation of natural gas to approximately 368,000 customers in a service area encompassing approximately in all 35 counties of South Carolina. SCANA Energy, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was the second largest marketer of natural gas in Georgia, serving more than 425,000 customers. SCANA Energy also had a regulated unit, SCANA Energy Regulated Division, selected by the Georgia Public Service Commission to serve as the state‚Äôs only regulated natural gas provider. PSNC Energy (Public Service North Carolina Energy) is a regulated public utility engaged primarily in purchasing, transporting, distributing and selling natural gas to approximately 563,000 customers in a service area encompassing approximately in 28 counties of North Carolina. Its headquarters is in Gastonia, North Carolina. History SCANA traced its history to 1846, when a group of Charleston business leaders formed the Charleston Gas Light Company. Its corporate structure dated to 1924, with the formation of Broad River Power Company. In 1925, Broad River bought the electric and gas properties of Columbia Railway, Gas and Electric Company. In 1937, the Broad River Power Company changed its name to South Carolina Electric & Gas Company. In 1942, SCE&G; acquired Lexington Water Power Company. Lexington Water Power Company had built the Saluda Dam, which created the Lake Murray, and was the largest man-made barrier built for power production in the world when completed in 1930. In 1948, the company acquired South Carolina Power Company, successor to Charleston Gas Light, from the Southern Company. In 1984, SCE&G; reorganized as a holding company, SCANA, with SCE&G; as its leading subsidiary. In 1997, the company sold Scana Petroleum Resources Inc. for $110 million. In 1999, the company sold its retail propane assets for $86 million. In February 2000, the company acquired Public Service of North Carolina for $673 million. In March 2004, the company acquired 50,000 retail natural gas customers formerly served by Energy America in Georgia. On February 2, 2015, Carolina Gas Transmission was sold to Dominion Resources $492.9 million. Formed in November 2006, Carolina Gas Transmission was an interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and Georgia regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Its predecessors were the South Carolina Pipeline Company and SCG Pipeline Company. Carolina Gas Transmission received gas from Southern Natural Gas Company, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation and the Southern LNG terminal at Elba Island, Georgia. On February 23, 2015, SCANA Communications was sold to Spirit Communications for $150 million. SCANA Communications operated fiber optic long line and access networks throughout South Carolina and in parts of North Carolina and Georgia in partnership with regional interexchange carriers. SCANA Communications also offered clients with Point of presence (POP) equipment co-location at designated sites along the fiber route and had a state-of-the-art data center in downtown Columbia, South Carolina. Services included site acquisition, zoning support, build-to-suite, site management of existing towers, shared tenant colocation centres, and fiber backbone access. After having spent $9 billion on construction, in July 2017, SCE&G; abandoned the construction of two additional AP1000 units at the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station, following the bankruptcy of Westinghouse Electric Company. Some investors and ratepayers filed lawsuits against SCE&G;, and some federal and state agencies started investigations. SCE&G; proposed replacing the nuclear capacity with gas and solar generation with shareholders absorbing the costs of the abandoned nuclear plant and customer charges reverting to pre-nuclear project rates. In May 2018, the company acquired the Columbia Energy Center in Gaston, South Carolina for $180 million. In January 2019, the company was acquired by Dominion Energy. By March 2019, the SCANA, SCE&G; and PSNC names were retired.

Kornbluth, first published in 1950. It combines the themes of mutant power, telepathy and ancient superstition. Plot summary The protagonist, the Mindworm of the title, is an orphan, the result of a liaison between a U.S. Navy lieutenant and a nurse aboard ship during viewing of early atomic tests. He is a mutant, as a result of the atomic fallout after the testing, and he can \\"hear\\" the thoughts of others around him. Cast out into the world as a young adult, he is about to be gang raped by hoboes when he discovers an ability to feed off strong emotions, killing one of his assailants in the process. He uses this to eliminate the rest of his attackers. He moves from town to town, eavesdropping on the thoughts of people around him, and using his abilities to induce the intense emotion he craves, and to gain material wealth. The thoughts he hears often represent a brutal side of America, as he hears the large and small cruelties people inflict on each other, ranging from family quarrels to beatings carried out in dark alleyways. He can hear thoughts in other languages, though he cannot understand them. As he moves into communities where new Eastern European immigrants have congregated, he starts hearing the term \\"wompyear\\". Just as he realizes that this is their pronunciation of the word \\"vampire\\" and they have recognized him, his neighbors burst in and kill him.

Settlements of the Chesapeake region grew slowly due to diseases such as malaria. Most of these settlers were male immigrants from England who died soon after their arrival. Due to the majority of men, eligible women did not remain single for long. The native-born population eventually became immune to the Chesapeake diseases and these colonies were able to continue through all the hardships. The Chesapeake region had a one-crop economy, based on tobacco. This contributed to the demand for slave labor in the Southern colonies. The tobacco also depleted nutrients in the soil, and new land was continually needed for its cultivation. White indentured servants were also common in this region early in its settlement, gradually being replaced by African slaves by the latter half of the seventeenth century due to improved economic conditions in Europe and the resulting decrease in emigration to the Chesapeake region. Indentured servants were people who signed a contract of indenture requiring them to work for their Chesapeake masters for an average of five to seven years, in return for the cost of the Atlantic crossing.

It grows at elevations of 100 to 800 m in kerangas forest.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. It is known with certainty only from Lambir Hills National Park and surrounding areas.Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Nepenthes hispida is listed as Conservation Dependent on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In the wild, N. hispida is only known to hybridise with N. reinwardtiana.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Description The stem of N. hispida grows to 6 m in length and 6 mm in diameter. The cylindrical internodes are up to 15 cm long. Leaves are sessile and coriaceous in texture. The lamina is oblanceolate-oblong in morphology and can measure up to 28 cm long and 4 cm wide. The apex of the lamina is acuminate-obtuse and often unequal. The base of the lamina is attenuate, amplexicaul, and often decurrent. Three longitudinal veins run along the lamina on each side of the midrib. Pennate veins are indistinct. Tendrils grow to 15 cm in length. A young rosette plant The pitchers of N. hispida are rarely more than 15 cm high and 8 cm wide. They are ovoid-ellipsoid in the lower parts and sub-cylindrical in the upper parts. Aerial or upper pitchers are more cylindrical than lower or terrestrial pitchers. Two fringed wings, up to 3 mm wide, run down the front of the pitchers. These wings are often absent in upper pitchers. The opening or mouth of the pitcher is ovate and oblique. The peristome is rounded and up to 12 mm wide. The lid or operculum is ovate- elliptic. An unbranched spur, up to 5 mm long, is inserted at the base of the lid. Nepenthes hispida has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 5 cm long and 1.5 cm thick. The rachis is attenuate and may grow to 10 cm in length. The partial peduncles, which are up to 8 mm long, are two-flowered at the base only, otherwise one-flowered. Sepals are elliptic and up to 4 mm long. Male and female inflorescences are of similar structure. A very dense indumentum of bristle-like, purple-grey hairs covers the stem. A sparser covering of shorter hairs is present on the inflorescence. Hairs on the surfaces of the leaves are apparently caducous, or shed at an early stage of development. Distribution and habitat In Nepenthes of Borneo, Charles Clarke writes: \\"N. hispida has been collected from a number of localities in northern Sarawak and Brunei, where its distribution overlaps with that of N. hirsuta\\". However, in Pitcher Plants of Sarawak, Clarke and Ch'ien Lee state: \\"Recent observations of populations of N. hirsuta throughout Sarawak suggest that morphological variation in this species is much greater than previously assumed. Accordingly, the only plants that we equate with N. hispida here are those from the Lambir Hills area\\". Nepenthes hispida grows in shady kerangas forest on steep sandstone ridges and is often sympatric with Eugeissona palms. The species occurs at elevations of 100 to 800 m. Taxonomy Rosette plants with lower pitchers Nepenthes hispida is very similar to the closely related N. hirsuta and some taxonomists contest its status as a separate species.Clarke, C.M. 2006. Introduction. In: Danser, B.H. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. pp. 1‚Äì15. It is also similar to N. macrovulagris, from which it differs in several aspects of pitcher and leaf morphology. In his 1928 monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", B. H. Danser reduced N. hispida to a synonym of N. hirsuta, writing \\"N. hispida Beck is placed among the synonyms [of N. hirsuta] on the authority of Macfarlane, though the description gives another idea\\".Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek restored N. hispida to species status in 1997, citing the amplexicaul-decurrent leaf base and indumentum as significant features that distinguish it from N. hirsuta.Jebb, M.H.P. & M. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1-106. It has been suggested that N. hirsuta and N. hispida are extreme variants of the same species, as there exist intergrades between both taxa. Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek suggest that N. hispida is related to N. philippinensis, a species endemic to Palawan in the Philippines.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 1999. Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) in Palawan, Philippines. Kew Bulletin 54(4): 887‚Äì895. Schlauer, J. 2000. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 29(2): 53.

The conservancy employs most maintenance and operations staff in the park. It effectively oversees the work of both the private and public employees under the authority of the publicly appointed Central Park administrator, who reports to the parks commissioner and the conservancy's president. The Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980 in the aftermath of Central Park's decline in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially devoted to fundraising for projects to restore and improve the park, it took over the park's management duties in 1998. The organization has invested more than $800 million toward the restoration and enhancement of Central Park since its founding. With an endowment of over $200 million, consisting of contributions from residents, corporations, and foundations, the Conservancy provides 75 percent of the Park's $65 million annual operating budget and is responsible for all basic care of the park. The Conservancy also provides maintenance support and staff training programs for other public parks in New York City, and has assisted with the development of new parks, such as the High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park. History =Creation= The Conservancy was born out of community concern during the park's rapid decline in the 1960s and 1970s. The 1975 New York City fiscal crisis left Central Park a virtually abandoned dustbowl that residents came to view as a dangerous, crime-ridden space. Many advocacy groups had been working separately to improve conditions in Central Park. This included the Central Park Task Force, formed in 1975 and led by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, an urban planner, writer and civic activist. In late 1974, Columbia University Professor E.S. Savas published a report, which concluded that the park needed one unpaid individual employed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) to oversee its daily operations. It also recommended the establishment of a private, citizen-based board that would advise the overseeing individuals, as well as the creation of the Central Park Community Fund. The Fund was subsequently founded by Richard Gilder and George Soros. The suggestions of the Savas report were also supported by Mayor Edward I. Koch's Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, and in 1979 the city established the Office of Central Park Administrator and appointed Barlow as the first Central Park Administrator. On December 13, 1980, the Central Park Task Force and the Central Park Community Fund joined to form the not-for-profit Central Park Conservancy, a public‚Äìprivate partnership created to bring private resources to the public Park. According to commissioner Davis, this was due to a need for \\"something permanent and nonpolitical, not subject to changes when a commissioner or mayor leaves office; but also something that was accountable to the public and that worked in partnership with the city.\\" Mayor Ed Koch selected philanthropist William Sperry Beinecke as the inaugural chair of the board of the Central Park Conservancy, and Beinecke in turn selected the board's roughly thirty private citizens. Beinecke also named a 44-person \\"Founders Committee\\" composed of individuals who had supported Central Park, such as Brooke Astor, George T. Delacorte Jr., Lucy Moses, Paul Newman, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The Conservancy included four working committees: the Program and Planning Committee, the Development Committee, the Nominating Committee, and the Audit Committee. =1980s renovations= Under the leadership of the Central Park Conservancy, the park's reclamation began by addressing needs that could not be met within NYC Parks' existing resources. The Conservancy hired interns and a small restoration staff to reconstruct and repair unique rustic features, undertaking horticultural projects, and removing graffiti under the broken windows theory, which advocated removing visible signs of decay. According to Conservancy president Douglas Blonsky: The first structure to be renovated was the Dairy, which was rehabilitated and reopened as the park's first visitor center in 1979. The Sheep Meadow, which reopened the following year, was the first landscape to be restored. By then, the Conservancy was engaged in design efforts and long-term restoration planning, and it hired Pamela Tice as its CEO in 1981. Some projects were already underway or complete. Bethesda Fountain, which had been dry for decades, was restored in 1981;Murphy and Ottavino 1986 and the USS Maine National Monument and the Bow Bridge had also already been restored. In its first annual financial report, for the two fiscal years ending June 30, 1982, the Conservancy reported $2 million in endowments, most of which came from donors who donated at least $1,000 each. At the end of 1981, Davis and Barlow announced a 10-year, $100 million \\"Central Park Management and Restoration Plan\\", under which all future renovations would proceed. The first project to be undertaken as part of the restoration plan was the renovation of Bethesda Terrace, which started in 1982.Central Park Conservancy on-line history . The long-closed Belvedere Castle was renovated and reopened in 1983, winning a renovation award from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which had previously designated the park as a scenic landmark. The renovation of Central Park also entailed the examination of thousands of plants, as well as the mapping and construction of new paths along heavily trafficked grass routes. In conjunction with this renovation, the Strawberry Fields memorial to the murdered musician John Lennon was built in the western end of the park, and the Dene Rustic Shelter was restored. The Conservancy started two fundraising initiatives in fiscal year 1983: the Olmsted Awards Luncheon and \\"You Gotta Have Park Weekend\\". On completion of the planning stage in 1985, the conservancy launched its first capital campaign, assuming increasing responsibility for funding the park's restoration, and full responsibility for designing, bidding, and supervising all capital projects in the park. The Conservancy developed a 15-year restoration plan that sought to remain true to the original design while supporting current goals of use. Over the next several years, the campaign restored landmarks in the southern part of the park, such as Grand Army Plaza, pp. 497-498; ; ; ; and the police station at the 86th Street transverse. In addition, the Conservatory Garden in the northern part of the park was restored by the landscape architect Lynden Miller and reopened in 1987. By 1988, the Conservancy was raising $6 million in donations annually. However, the Conservancy still faced obstacles, including opposition to projects such as the reconstruction of the Mall's bandshell and the erection of the North Meadow Recreation Center. While most of the park's restorations in the 1980s were Conservancy projects, two major attractions were restored by other entities. Real estate developer Donald Trump took over the Wollman Rink in 1987 and renovated it after plans to renovate the rink were repeatedly delayed. The New York Zoological Society, which signed an agreement with the city to take over the Central Park Zoo in 1980, closed the zoo in 1983 for renovation. The zoo reopened four years later after a $35 million renovation. =1990s renovations= Improvements to the northern end of the park began in 1989, following several assaults on April 19, 1989 in the Central Park jogger case. Work on the Ravine in the northern part of the park was completed by 1992. The following year, the Conservancy announced a $51 million capital campaign. This resulted in the restoration of bridle trails, the Mall, the Harlem Meer, and the North Woods, as well as the construction of the Dana Discovery Center at the Harlem Meer. Afterward, the Conservancy embarked on its most ambitious landscape restoration: the overhaul of the near the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond. The project was the centerpiece of the Conservancy's three-year Wonder of New York Campaign, which raised $71.5 million and also helped restore southern and western landscapes, as well as the North Meadow. The Great Lawn project was completed in 1997. Though they operated under a memorandum of understanding as a public-private partnership for 18 years, the Conservancy and the City of New York did not formalize a management agreement until 1998, under the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The city would retain control over major policy decisions about the Park as well as the enforcement of rules and laws within it, with the Conservancy responsible for day-to-day maintenance and operations. The Conservancy's original contract with the City was renewed in 2006. Under the eight-year agreement, the Conservancy receives an annual fee for services. Citywide budget cuts in the early 1990s resulted in attrition of the park's routine maintenance staff, and the Conservancy began hiring staff to replace these workers. Management of the restored landscapes by the Conservancy's \\"zone gardeners\\" proved so successful that core maintenance and operations staff were reorganized in 1996. The zone-based system of management was implemented throughout the park, which was divided into 49 zones. The Conservancy recruited volunteers to also help in maintenance. In 2007, there were 3,000 volunteers compared to just under 250 paid workers in the park. =2000s to present= Renovations continued through the first decade of the 21st century. Conservatory Water was restored over six months in 2000, and the restoration of the Pond began the same year. A new Reservoir fence was installed in 2004 under a capital project that replaced the old chain-link fence with a replica of the 8,000-foot long steel and cast-iron one that had enclosed the Reservoir in 1926. The new fence, along with removal of invasive trees and shrubs, restored the panoramic views of the park and Manhattan skyline. Another ambitious restoration effort began in 2004, when Conservancy staff and contractors worked together to refurbish the ceiling of the Bethesda Arcade. Originally designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, the ceiling of the Arcade is lined by 15,876 elaborately patterned encaustic tiles. Salt and water infiltration from the roadway above had badly damaged the tiles, leaving their backing plates so corroded they had to be removed in the 1980s.Murphy and Ottavino 1986 and The tiles were held in storage for more than 20 years until the Conservancy embarked on a $7 million restoration effort in 2004 to return the Minton tiles to their original luster. The completed Bethesda Terrace Arcade was unveiled in March 2007. The Ramble and Lake was renovated by the Central Park Conservancy, in a project to enhance both its ecological and scenic aspects. In 2007 the first phase of a restoration of the Lake and its shoreline plantings commenced. During the same time, Bank Rock Bridge was recreated in carved oak with cast-iron panels and pine decking, its original materials, following Vaux's original design of 1859‚Äì60.The former replacement bridge with utilitarian spiked steel pipe handrails. The cascade, where the Gill empties into the lake, was reconstructed to approximate its dramatic original form. The island formerly in the lake, which had gradually eroded below water level, was replanted with aqueous plants such as Pickerel weed.Central Park Conservancy press release The first renovated sections were opened to visitors in April 2008 and the project was complete by 2012. The final feature to be restored was the East Meadow, which was rehabilitated in 2011. The Conservancy began raising money for a $300 million cleanup initiative in 2013, and within three years, it had raised over a third of that amount. Minor renovation projects continued through the park in the late 2010s. The Belvedere Castle was closed in 2018 for an extensive renovation, reopening in June 2019. Also in 2018, it was announced that Lasker Rink would be closed between 2020 and 2023 for a $150 million renovation. Later in 2018, it was announced that the Delacorte Theater would also be closed from 2020 to 2022 for a $110 million rebuild.  Responsibilities  The Dairy, one of the visitor centers in Central Park operated by the Conservancy = Park maintenance and visitor information = Conservancy crews care for acres of lawns, of lakes and streams, of woodlands, and approximately 20,000 trees. The Conservancy's staff installs hundreds of thousands of plantings annually, including bulbs, shrubs, flowers, and trees. They maintain 9,000 benches, 26 ballfields, and 21 playgrounds and are responsible for the preservation of 55 sculptures and monuments and 36 arches and bridges. Conservancy crews remove graffiti and collect more than 2,000 tons of trash a year. The Conservancy maintains a zone-management system, which divides Central Park into territories managed by individual supervisors who are held accountable for their zone's condition. The park has 49 zones managed by \\"zone gardeners\\" who work with volunteers and specialty crews to maintain their designated landscapes. The Conservancy operates five visitor centers in Central Park: Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, Belvedere Castle, Chess & Checkers House, the Dairy, and Columbus Circle. These visitor centers distribute maps and other information about the park. The Dairy contains the park's official gift shop. = Events and activities = Central Park Conservancy hosts a number of events and activities, such as festivals, games, volunteering opportunities, and tours. Every August since 2003, the Conservancy has hosted the Central Park Film Festival, a series of free film screenings. The Conservancy also hosts Harlem Meer Performance Festival, a free concert series held each summer since 1994. Other activities include catch and release fishing in the Harlem Meer; official tours of the park; and board games. = Programs = Central Park Conservancy's educational division, the Institute for Urban Parks, is composed of two subdivisions: the Center for Urban Park Discovery and the Center for Urban Park Management. The program has assisted with the development of new parks such as the High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park. Its Five-Borough Crew provides staff and programming assistance to parks around the city. The Conservancy has also participated in cleanup and maintenance initiatives for other city parks. In 2005, the Conservancy created the Historic Harlem Parks initiative, providing maintenance, gardening support, and mentoring to workers in Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, and Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem. In late 2014, mayor Bill de Blasio announced an initiative where the Conservancy, as well as seven other organizations that care for the city's large public parks, would donate workers, labors, and money to assist smaller parks in New York City's poorer neighborhoods. The Central Park Conservancy would be involved in the cleanup of two dozen parks, and would train gardeners and deploy the Five-Borough Crew to these parks. Management The Conservancy's founding board members ex officio included William Sperry Beinecke and Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, as well as mayor Koch, park commissioner Davis, and Manhattan borough president Andrew Stein. Beinecke was the chair of the board of the Central Park Conservancy, while Rogers was the initial president of the Conservancy. The Conservancy has been led by five presidents over its history. Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the first and longest-serving president, was appointed as administrator in 1979 and named the Conservancy's first president upon its founding in 1980. She stepped down as both Conservancy president and Central Park administrator at the end of 1995. Karen H. Putnam, who worked as the Conservancy's development director, took over both posts. Douglas Blonsky took over the role of Central Park administrator in 1998. The presidency was not Blonsky's first role in the Conservancy; he had originally been hired as construction supervisor for the Park in 1985 by Rogers. After Putnam resigned as Conservancy president in 2000, Regina S. Peruggi took on the role, leaving her position as president of Marymount Manhattan College. Peruggi stepped down in 2004 to become president of Kingsborough Community College, and Blonsky took over the role of Conservancy president. Upon Blonsky's retirement in 2017, Elizabeth W. Smith became president in March 2018.  Financing  Aerial view of southern Central Park in 2017, following the completion of the Conservancy's park renovation projects In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the Central Park Conservancy had net assets (own equity) of $360.846 million and liabilities of $28.144 million, which amounted to total assets of $388.990 million. Net assets decreased $15.122 million from the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. For tax purposes, the Conservancy's Employer Identification Number is 13-3022855. The Conservancy had an annual operating budget of $65-67 million in 2016, of which 75% comes from donations and the balance from municipal and state tax revenue. The Central Park Conservancy's overall endowment was over $200 million in 2014. Much of this amount came from large donations. The largest was in October 2012, when hedge fund manager John A. Paulson announced a $100 million gift to the Central Park Conservancy, the largest ever monetary donation to New York City's park system. Prior to Paulson's gift, the majority of donations to the Conservancy came from a relatively small group of 55,000 people who lived within a \\"10-minute walk\\" of Central Park. , the Conservancy had spent nearly $800 million on improving Central Park.  Honors  The Conservancy has received several awards and honors. In 2001, the Conservancy and three other organizations were given the Award for Outstanding Commitment to the Preservation and Care of Collections by the American Institute for Conservation. In 2008, the American Planning Association recognized Central Park for being one of that year's Great Public Spaces in America. The association described the Park as \\"arguably the most emulated park in the country\\" and cited it as \\"an exemplary public space that successfully maintains a large naturalistic landscape in the midst of one of the densest cities in the country.\\" Additionally, in 2017, the American Society of Landscape Architects gave the Conservancy the Landscape Architecture Medal of Excellence.

Damage was particularly severe in the city of Winnipeg and its environs, which were inundated on May 5, also known as Black Friday to some residents. An estimated 70,000‚Äì100,000 residents had to be evacuated, and four of eleven bridges were destroyed. In that year, the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley, more than . One man died, and property losses due to the flood were estimated at more than $600 million to one billion. To prevent and reduce future damage, the government constructed the Red River Floodway, which was completed in 1968. It has been estimated to have prevented more than $100 billion (CAD) in cumulative flood damage. Winnipeg Elm Park sheltered evacuees during the flood.

The north-flowing Red River was fed by flows resulting from melting of heavy snows in the winter and runoff from heavy rains in the spring. Eight dikes gave way and flooded much of Winnipeg, turning an estimated of farmland in the area into an enormous lake. A total of more than in the Red River Valley were flooded, from Emerson to north to Greater Winnipeg.

In the end, four of eleven bridges in the city were destroyed and nearly 100,000 people had to be evacuated from their homes and businesses. This was the largest evacuation in Canadian history until the 1979 Mississauga train derailment. In Winnipeg there was one fatality; property damage was severe, with losses estimated at between $600 million and more than a billion dollars. As a result of the widespread damage, the government built the Red River Floodway, to divert flood waters from Winnipeg to more distant portions of the river. The project was completed in 1968 and has been used 20 times. From 1950 to about 1997, it was derogatorily referred to as \\"Duff's Ditch\\", after the premier (Dufferin Roblin) that built the floodway. It is estimated to have prevented more than $100 billion (CAD) in cumulative flood damage. The Floodway was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2000, and is considered an outstanding engineering achievement both in terms of function and effects.

Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. No infraspecific taxa have been described. Discovery and naming Nepenthes campanulata was first collected on 9 September 1957, on Mount Ilas Bungaan by A.J.G. 'Doc' Kostermans, the head of the Botanical Division of the Forestry Research Institute at Bogor, on the same expedition in which he collected the type material of N. mapuluensis. Kostermans wrote the following account of his discovery: > I was working for the Forestry Department at that time in Sangkulirang and > when I had finished I wanted to find out about a flowering rock, Ilas > Bungaan, upriver. After 10 days walking I saw the yellowish rock for the > first time. When we were there we discovered that the yellow colour was that > of the leaves of a Nepenthes completely covering the steep face of the 50 m > high rock. We cut a tree that fell to the rock and acted as a ladder and > climbed up. The Nepenthes was not in flower or fruit, but we found caves in > the rock and in the caves a couple of boat-like coffins with sculptured dog- > head ends which contained decapitated skeletons. Nepenthes campanulata was described by Shigeo Kurata in 1973 based on a single specimen, Kostermans 13764, deposited at the herbarium of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. An isotype labelled \\"spec. nov.!\\" is held at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Two more isotypes are deposited at the New York Botanical Garden.

The New York Botanical Garden. According to Kurata, the collector stated that the species was endemic to this single location \\"presumably owing to its habitat which is noted as sand and limestone walls at an altitude of 300 m\\". The type material of N. campanulata lacks floral structures and these remained unknown until the species' rediscovery in 1997. Description Nepenthes campanulata produces short, cylindrical, climbing stems 20 to 50 cm tall and up to 4 mm thick. Leaves are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina is spathulate-lanceolate in morphology, up to 12 cm long,Lee, C.C. 2006. Species profile: Nepenthes campanulata. WildBorneo. and 2 cm across. The apex of the lamina is rounded and slightly peltate. The base of the lamina is amplexicaul. Two to three longitudinal veins are present on each side. Pennate veins are inconspicuous. Tendrils are very short and stiff, rarely exceeding 4 cm in length. Unlike most other species in the genus, N. campanulata produces only one type of pitcher. As the specific epithet suggests, these are campanulate or bell- shaped. The yellow-green pitchers grow to 10 cm in height and 5.5 cm in diameter. They typically lack fringed wings, instead bearing a pair of ribs running down the front. Inside the pitchers, the glandular region covers only the lowest quarter of the inner surface. The opening or mouth of the pitcher is circular and positioned horizontally. The peristome is greatly reduced and bears a row of tiny teeth. The pitcher lid is elliptic to oblong and has no appendages. An unbranched, 1 mm long spur is inserted at the base of the lid. N. campanulata is wholly glabrous. Plants spread by means of subterranean runners. Mature plants often form large clumps with numerous growth points.Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Distribution and habitat The population of N. campanulata from which the type specimen originated was destroyed as a result of forest fires in 1983. All known populations were completely killed off in late 1991 or early 1992.Nerz, J. 1994. Nepenthes- discussion. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List. Nepenthes campanulata was at this time thought to have become extinct. However, the species was rediscovered in 1997 by Ch'ien Lee on the limestone cliffs of Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak, more than 400 km from the type locality.Steiner, H. 2002.

The Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society 51(3). In July 2013, a taxon closely resembling N. campanulata was observed and photographed growing on the limestone cliffs of the Saint Paul formation, Palawan, the Philippines. Charles Clarke and Ch'ien Lee consider these plants likely to represent N. campanulata, or at least a close relative. Nepenthes campanulata is a lowland species, growing lithophytically at elevations of 100‚Äì300 m above sea level. It inhabits damp, mossy areas on cliff faces and appears to be endemic to limestone substrates. Taxonomy In his description of N. campanulata, Kurata suggested that it may be closely related to N. inermis, a Sumatran endemic. However, other taxonomists disagree with this hypothesis. These two species are similar in general stature as well as pitcher morphology. However, they are not only separated by great geographical distance, but also occur in completely different habitats; N. campanulata is a lowland species endemic to limestone substrates, whereas N. inermis usually grows as an epiphyte at elevations of 1500 to 2600 m.Clarke, C.M. 2001.

Finham shares its northern boundary along the A45 with the suburb of Styvechale/Stivichall to the north, and part of its southeastern boundary is shared with the village of Baginton in Warwickshire. The suburb of Green Lane lies directly to the west and the hamlet of King's Hill lies within a mile of Finham at Coventry's southernmost point. Finham civil parish was created on 1 April 2016. Finham is roughly triangular in shape; its northern boundary is along the Kenpas Highway (A45); its southeastern boundary is along the A46, and its southwestern boundary is, for the most part, along Green Lane. Finham Park School and Finham Primary School, are the two schools in Finham. Education A large comprehensive school Finham Park School, a Mathematics and Computer college and also a teacher training school, is situated on Green Lane. It was completed in 1970 on former farmland on the west side of Green Lane. Also located along Green Lane, is Finham Primary School, a which was moved to Green Lane from its previous location on Brentwood Avenue, also in Finham. The school was almost entirely rebuilt in the mid-1980s. There is a library that is open from Monday to Saturday. King's Hill proposed developments In March 2009, a meeting was held at Finham Primary School to discuss the proposed housing developments in Finham, whereby a new housing estate would be built from Green Lane South adjacent to King's Hill hamlet, running parallel alongside the A46 up to the Stoneleigh Road. This development would fall under Warwickshire County, as it is just past the border of Coventry. The meeting raised important issues on the matter, from the increased volume of traffic which would cause major problems due to the surrounding roads not being able to accommodate this number of vehicles, to the lack of public transport networks available in the surrounding areas. It has caused major uproar with local residents, and a petition has begun in an attempt to stop the proposed plans, along with a new Finham Residents Association website. On 26 March 2009, it became clear that the known demands from Warwick District Council could be dwarfed by an additional inability of Coventry Council to allocate 7,000 housing units within its boundary. Coventry has been given permission to place these 7,000 outside, but adjacent to its boundaries in the south and /or in the north. It also became known that the proposed developments to expand Finham Park secondary school, and move the school further back to accommodate more pupils and car parking space, went on hold whilst the current King's Hill development planning is under review. St Martin-in-the-Fields church St Martin-in- the-Fields church, Green Lane, Finham, Coventry, on 17/9/2006 the day refurbishments were opened. The Finham church, 'St Martin-in-the-Fields', was built in 1938 and is situated on Green Lane at the northwest extremity of Finham. It was recently refurbished and a hallway was built leading into the main church. The refurbished church and buildings were opened to the public on 17 September 2006. Places and geography in proximity Despite Finham being in the West Midlands county (and part of Coventry), Finham Sewage Works are actually south of Finham, in Warwickshire. The works were used in the 1969 film The Italian Job starring Michael Caine. The underground concrete piping, then the widest of its kind in Europe, was used for the iconic scenes where several Minis raced through the tunnels of Turin. Adjacent to the sewerage works is Finham Golf Course, the River Sowe and Finham Brook.

It is situated in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. At the 2001 Census the population of Nannerch was 531, reducing to 233 at the 2011 Census. The community population in 2011 was 496. History Nannerch (pronounced Nan-er-ch Welsh) is one of the ancient parishes of Flintshire, made up of the townships of Trellan, Trefechan, Trecwm and Tre Penbedw. It is an ancient village, sitting on bedrock of Carboniferous Limestone, overlain by glacial boulder clay with glacial hollows. The limestone has been used in the construction of many local buildings. The ruins of Iron Age hill forts at Pen-y-Cloddiau and Moel Arthur are situated in the nearby hills. The Church The church, which is dedicated to St. Michael and All Angels, was consecrated on 29 September 1853. It is the third church known to have been built on the site. The curved wall of the graveyard indicates the ancient origins of the churches. The present church was designed by Thomas W. Wyatt, of London, the architect of the neighbouring churches of Brynford and Gorsedd. Services open to everyone are held in the church at 9.30 am each Sunday. 'Fifth Sunday' services rotate around churches in the Bro Famau group of churches of which St. Michael's church is a member. Nannerch has no shops but has an 18th-century inn called The Cross Foxes. The village also has a primary school. There are currently around 60 pupils enrolled. On the same site as the Victorian primary school is a small sports development consisting of a tennis court which doubles as a basketball/netball court and five-a-side football pitch, a grass football pitch and a bowling green. The bowling green also has a French-style boules piste next to it. Nannerch is sometimes visited by a doctor at the village hall on Tuesday morning. On Thursday there is a Post Office counter in the hall. Theatre The village has a dramatic group called the Nannerch Players. The Players perform two shows a year; one of these will be a pantomime, performed just before Christmas. One full-length play performed in the summer months (usually May‚ÄìJune) and give out the golden lemon award to a great performance which this year was given to Carys Grieve. Transport The main A541 Mold - Denbigh road bypasses the village. The Mold and Denbigh Junction Railway, which opened in 1869, passed through the village. Nannerch railway station was situated near the point where the road into Nannerch forks left to leave the A541 road from Mold. After the line was closed in 1962, a victim of the Beeching Axe, the station was converted to a private dwelling with a garden between the platforms.Jones, Mark: Lost Railways Of North Wales, page 69. Countryside Books, 2008 It was demolished shortly afterwards to allow the road to be straightened. Besides passenger traffic, the station provided for the transportation of cattle and sheep heading for market, the distribution of local milk and the delivery of newspapers to the community.

The title is used in many different political systems. Holy See In the Holy See, undersecretary is a title given to senior administrative officials working in the dicasteries of the Roman Curia. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, undersecretary is a position created in 2008 to work closely with bureau secretaries and top civil servants to implement the Chief Executive's policy blueprint and agenda in an executive-led government. The appointment of undersecretaries and political assistants is an extension of the Principal Officials Accountability System into today's Political Appointments System.Mary Ma, \\"It pays to be forward looking\\" , The Standard, June 04, 2008 India In India, undersecretary is an officer level secretariat post in central ministries, tenanted by officers of various civil services, usually promoted officers from the Group 'B' (section officers) of the Central Secretariat Service, or the newly appointed officers of the Indian Administrative Service, or other Group 'A' services on deputation in the central government in early stages of their careers with a minimum of 7‚Äì8 years of service. Officers in this capacity further manage desk or section officers within a ministry or central regulatory body. Undersecretaries occupy gazetted civil service posts in India, unlike in some Western democracies, where they are political appointees. An undersecretary will typically report to a deputy secretary, or a director to the Government of India. Italy In Italy, Undersecretary is a second-in-command to a politically appointed Minister. In particular, he/she is appointed with a President of the Republic Decree, on proposal of the Prime Minister, who previously agreed such proposal with the relevant Minister. Netherlands In the Netherlands, a State Secretary () is the title of a junior member of the Cabinet of the Netherlands; they are sometimes referred to as Undersecretaries. They take over part of the portfolio of a certain minister and falls under the responsibility of that minister, but is at the same time also separately responsible to the States General of the Netherlands. They do not attend the weekly Council of Ministers unless specifically invited. Some are allowed to use the title \\"minister\\" in meetings with foreign colleagues who are responsible for the same topic area (who may be ministers). Portugal In Portugal the level of undersecretary is not a pro-forma echelon in the executive hierarchy. Such posts are created on an ad hoc basis as required. It is the lowest rung in the executive power. There is currently only one undersecretary of State in the present government. Spain In the Spanish Government, the Undersecretary is a political appointee charged with the daily representation of a ministry, the management of the common services and personnel. The position is equivalent to the British Permanent Secretary. The Undersecretary reports to the Minister, and is appointed by the King on the advice of the Council of Ministers. United Kingdom The title of Under- Secretary is used in two different contexts in the British political system. A Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State is a junior member of the government, always an MP from the governing party, who is appointed to assist a Secretary of State or other government minister. They rank between a Minister of State and a Parliamentary Private Secretary; the rank is usually seen as a stepping- stone to higher political office. In contrast, a Permanent Under-Secretary of State is the full title of a Permanent Secretary, a senior civil servant employed to head part of a government department and oversee the implementation of policy. United States In the United States executive branch, an undersecretary is a senior official in a government department, junior to a departmental Secretary such as the Secretary of State and usually junior to a Deputy Secretary as well. An Undersecretary is typically a career government official, as opposed to a political appointee. They may head specific sub-departments or agencies such as the Defense Intelligence Agency, or be responsible for a specific area of policy within the department, e.g. the Undersecretary for Management within the Department of State. Before 1972, \\"Undersecretary\\" (also spelled \\"Under Secretary\\") signified the senior deputy to a cabinet Secretary, especially of State and Treasury. The office of Under Secretary of State was replaced by the Deputy Secretary of State and the office of Under Secretary of the Treasury was replaced by the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.

Conflicts arose concerning what was considered acceptable and respectable and what ought to be proscribed or made illegal. The conflict quickly coalesced into one largely between the liberal urban areas against the conservative rural areas. Disputes over human origin and the Scopes trial It made for great oratory between eminent rivals, and it put the debate over teaching evolution on front pages across the country. But one thing the Scopes \\"monkey trial\\" of 1925 did not do was settle the contentious issue of evolution in the schools, which continues to incite strong passions and court actions to this day. The trial was about challenging a newly passed Tennessee state law against teaching evolution or any other theory denying the biblical account of the creation of man. Broadly, the case reflected a collision of traditional views and values with more modern ones: It was a time of evangelism by figures such as Aimee Semple McPherson and Billy Sunday against forces, including jazz, sexual permissiveness, and racy Hollywood movies, which they thought were undermining the authority of the Bible and Christian morals in society. John Scopes, the 24-year-old defendant, taught in the public high school in Dayton, Tenn., and included evolution in his curriculum. He agreed to be the focus of a test case attacking the new law, and was arrested for teaching evolution and tried with the American Civil Liberties Union backing his defense. His lawyer was the legendary Clarence Darrow, who, besides being a renowned defense attorney for labor and radical figures, was an avowed agnostic in religious matters. The state's attorney was William Jennings Bryan, a Christian, pacifist, and former candidate for the U.S. presidency. He agreed to take the case because he believed that evolution theory led to dangerous social movements. And he believed the Bible should be interpreted literally. The weather was stiflingly hot and the rhetoric equally heated in this \\"trial of the century\\" attended by hundreds of reporters and others who crowded the Rhea County Courthouse in July 1925. Rather than the validity of the law under which Scopes was being charged, the authority of the Bible versus the soundness of Darwin's theory became the focus of the arguments. \\"Millions of guesses strung together,\\" is how Bryan characterized evolutionary theory, adding that the theory made man \\"indistinguishable among the mammals.\\" Darrow, in his attacks, tried to poke holes in the Genesis story according to modern thinking, calling them \\"fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes.\\" The jury found Scopes guilty of violating the law and fined him. Bryan and the anti-evolutionists claimed victory, and the Tennessee law would stand for another 42 years. But Clarence Darrow and the ACLU had succeeded in publicizing scientific evidence for evolution, and the press reported that though Bryan had won the case, he had lost the argument. The verdict did have a chilling effect on teaching evolution in the classroom, however, and not until the 1960s did it reappear in schoolbooks. Isolationism, immigration, and communism America's isolationist philosophy after World War I gave rise to a xenophobic feeling across the nation. This was concentrated in rural areas and especially in the Southern United States and Indiana, where the Ku Klux Klan gained widespread support and sought to persecute immigrants and minorities in the 1920s. At the same time, communism was still a new philosophy in government, and much of the general American public held a hostile view toward it, especially after the 1919 United States anarchist bombings. The beginning of the 1920s saw the height and fall of First Red Scare as exemplified in the trials of Sacco and Vanzetti. This opposition to communism was caused by the bloody terror of the Bolshevik Revolution. =Ku Klux Klan= The rising nativism and illiberality also found expression after World War I in the reemergence and phenomenal growth of the Ku Klux Klan. Unlike the original Reconstruction-era Klan which was purely a southern phenomenon intent on holding the freed slave in a position of inferiority, the modern Klan formed active chapters in every region of the country and temporarily gained both respectability and political power. The age was ripe for a secret and seemingly all-powerful organization committed to reasserting traditional American values by force and intimidation if necessary. Such was the effect of World War I and the paranoia of the Red Scare. To millions of Americans in the postwar era, the country seemed beset with problems and on the verge of ruin. \\"The white, native-born Protestant American, as a member of the religious and racial majority, was usually incapable of doubting his native institutions. The blame for the maladies of his world must rest elsewhere. And so he looked to alien influences - Roman Catholics who supposedly challenged Protestant hegemony and the separation of church and state. Catholic, Orthodox, and Jewish immigrants crowding onto American shores, Negroes seeking more equitable treatment, American Jews who kept living costs up while wages went down, and numerous other elements of frustration before which he felt helpless. Then the Klan entered his community and offered him a way to fight back.\\" Now was the time to fight back, to reassert traditional values, or lose forever those qualities which had made America great. It's not surprising that the Klan's strongest supporters were residents of the rural and isolated countryside and city dwellers who had just recently arrived from the farm who were shocked by the lifestyles they witnessed in the big city. The drastic changes of the preceding half century had largely passed them by and lessened their influence in the country they felt they had once dominated. Now resentment of city and city people and nativism came together in the form of the Ku Klux Klan. Using violence, intimidation, and organized political activity, the Klan lashed out at those groups which seemingly were defiling America with strange customs, strange religions, and strange morals. The Klan supported the deportations crusade of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer at the height of the Red Scare. The Klan pressured Congress to limit immigration into the country. Such limitations would also stem the flow of Roman Catholics and Jews into what had always been primarily a Protestant country. Perhaps their strongest efforts, at least in Texas and other southwestern states, was to impose middle-class Protestant morality on all members of society no matter where they lived. According to Charles C. Alexander in his study The Klan in the Southwest : \\"There was also in the Klan a definite strain of moral bigotry. Especially in the Southwest this zeal found expression in direct, often violent, attempts to force conformity. Hence the southwestern Klansman√≠s conception of reform encompassed efforts to preserve premarital chastity, marital fidelity, and respect for parental authority; to compel obedience to state and national prohibition laws; to fight the postwar crime wave; and to rid state and local governments of dishonest politicians.\\" Individuals in Texas thus were threatened, beaten, or tarred-and-feathered for practicing the \\"new morality,\\" cheating on their spouses, beating their spouses or children, looking at women in a lewd manner, imbibing alcohol, etc. The Klan began to participate in politics in order to cleanse this arena of corruption and to legislate their idea of moral behavior. Because it attracted, at least in the beginning, \\"respectable\\" members of society, the Klan quickly gained significant political power at the state and local levels of government. In Texas for instance the Klan was able to elect a number of local officials in Austin, Houston, and Dallas. Historians feel that members of the Klan probably constituted a majority of the Texas legislature between 1922 and 1924. The Texas Klan even had one of its own, Earl B. Mayfield of Austin, elected to the U. S. Senate at the height of its power. The Klan grew so powerful on the national scene by 1924 that opponents were unable to convince the Democratic party's convention that year to censure the Klan for its intolerance and violent methods. It was widely recognized at the time that the Klan's most powerful chapter in the nation was that in Indiana. In 1923, the membership of the Indiana Klan exploded when local recruiter David Curtiss Stephenson became the organization's Grand Wizard. By late 1923, Stephenson led the Indiana Klan in breaking away from the national organization and forming a rival group. The Indiana Klan stressed more social issues than racism, as it promised to uphold moral standards, help enforce Prohibition, and end political corruption. The Klan also publicly attacked adulterers, gamblers, and undisciplined youths. Stephenson gained the support of many ministers and church congregations for these appeals to populist issues, and the Klan grew rapidly in Indiana. At the height of its power the Klan had over 250,000 members, which was over 30% of state's white male population. The highest concentration was around the central part of the state. Though it counted a high number of members statewide, its importance peaked in the 1924 election of Edward L. Jackson for governor. Switching from the Democrat to the more popular Republican Party, Stephenson sought to cement control over Indiana's political scene. During the 1924 November elections in Indiana, Jackson and several other elected Republican officials in the state were handpicked by Stephenson after they signed pledges affirming support for him. Following the election, Stephenson was then regarded as \\"the law in Indiana.\\" Yet just when the Klan seemed to wield such power and influence, it was actually on the verge of collapse. In the mid-twenties the Klan was beset by a series of internal struggles and scandals that resulted in political losses. The fall of Klan's power in Indiana would have a devastating impact on the organization's influence nationwide. The Indiana Klan's influence was diminished in 1925 after Stephenson kidnapped and raped local educator Madge Oberholtzer, who died soon afterwards in large part due to a staph infection she obtained as a result of the injuries Stephenson inflicted on her during this ordeal. Though it was acknowledged that Oberholtzer's decision to attempt suicide by swallowing mercuric chloride tablets contributed to her kidney failure, it was determined through an autopsy that the injuries Stephenson inflicted on her were also sufficient enough to kill her because the staph infection which resulted from them had reached both her lungs and kidneys. The autopsy also determined that Oberholtzer also might have been saved if Stephenson had not refused to take her to a hospital while he took her hostage;Daniel O. Linder, \\"D.C. Stephenson\\", Testimony, Famous Trials, hosted at University of Missouri Law School, Kansas City in her dying declaration, Oberholtzer claimed that she recanted her decision to allow herself to die and asked Stephenson to take her to a hospital, but he refused to do so because she would not agree to marry him.The Dying Declaration Of Madge Oberholtzer: The Key Evidence In The 1925 Trial Of D. C. Stephenson, From My Indiana by Irving Liebowitz (1964) (pp.195-203) In November 1925, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and was given a life sentence. In addition to the rape and murder, evidence released during his trial gravely weakened the Indiana Klan's propaganda when it was revealed that Stephenson, who had often defended Protestant womanhood and Prohibition in public, was in private a womanizer and an alcoholic. With the Stephenson affair damaging the Klan's image as upholders of law and morality, their influence on American society was severely crippled by 1926.Ku Klux Klan in Indiana Accessed November 30, 2013 In 1927, Stephenson would retaliate to Jackson's refusal to pardon him by having his aids release the documented pledges which proved that several Indiana politicians, including Jackson, had accepted bribes and other illegal favors from the Indiana Klan in exchange for their support. The state filed indictments against Governor Jackson; George V. \\"Cap\\" Coffin, chairman of the Marion County Republican Party; and attorney Robert I. Marsh, charging them with conspiring to bribe former Governor Warren McCray. The mayor of Indianapolis, John Duvall, was convicted and sentenced to jail for 30 days (and barred from political service for four years). Some Republican commissioners of Marion County resigned from their posts after being charged with accepting bribes from the Klan and Stephenson.\\"Indiana and the Ku Klux Klan\\" , Center for History The nativism of the postwar era peaked and began to recede with the passage of the National Origins Act and with it the appeal of the Klan lost its luster. Furthermore, the \\"respectable\\" members of the Klan, shocked by its violent tendencies, began to drop out and by the end of the decade the Klan was once again viewed by most Americans as part of the extremist lunatic fringe. =Immigration and the National Origins Act= Support for immigration restrictions, which began at the turn of the century and had built steadily for twenty years, led to congressional passage of the National Origins Act. This legislation severely restricted the total number of foreigners who would be allowed to enter the United States legally in any given year. It also instituted a quota system intentionally designed to hit Asia and eastern and southern Europe the hardest. The impact was to shut the doors of the country to Asians altogether and slow the flood of Italians, Poles, and Russians to a bare trickle of what it had been. Immigration curtailment was unquestionably part of the rural counterattack of the 1920s. The countryside was the most Anglo-Saxon, the most Protestant, the most traditional area of the nation and the region that felt most threatened by continued immigration. The fact that rural residents were most supportive of immigration restrictions is clearly borne out by the fact that not a single congressman from south of the Mason-Dixon line or west of the Mississippi River voted against the National Origins Act. Only in the urban Northeast was there opposition. With the number of immigrants thus limited, many felt perhaps America could be saved. =1928 US Presidential Election and revival of extreme nativism= The urban-rural confrontation of the 1920s seems neatly symbolized by the presidential election of 1928 and the defection of many traditional Democrats to the Republican candidate because of their shock at the nomination of Al Smith by their own party. The Republican Party was riding the crest of national popularity in 1928, basking in the glow of the economic boom which Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge had seemingly engineered. Herbert Hoover's election became inevitable when many lifelong Democrats in the South and Southwest rejected their party's nominee. Rural Democrats simply could not vote for Smith because he seemed to represent everything that threatened their America. He was a practicing Roman Catholic in a decade of virulent anti-Catholicism. He opposed national prohibition and openly flaunted the law during the election campaign. Furthermore, he was suspect because of his links to the urban political machine - Tammany Hall of New York City. In contrast, Hoover, while a member of the Republican Party, which had long been discredited in the South and Southwest because of the Reconstruction experience, was a native of Iowa, one of the most rural states in the union. He was a Protestant who openly and forcefully supported Prohibition. Unlike Smith, he was untainted by any association with machine politics. Rather, his character and reputation seemed sterling. He had saved Europe from starvation in the aftermath of World War I by leading a volunteer relief campaign, he was a self-made millionaire, and, as secretary of commerce from 1921 to 1928, had helped produce the current economic boom. J. Frank Norris, a leading fundamentalist pastor in Texas, campaigned across the state on behalf of Hoover saying that the only real issue in the campaign was Smith's Catholicism. Norris and others painted dire pictures of the future should Smith be victorious. The pope would actually be running the country and very quickly separation of church and state and freedom of religion would be relics of America's distant past. The strength of the urban-rural confrontation in the election can be seen in the fact that Texas - rural, Protestant, and solidly Democratic in its historic party affiliation - ended up in the Republican party column for the first time in its history. Nor was it alone. Hoover also carried the old Confederate states of Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia.

It is one of three genera of Cenomanian snakes known to have possessed hindlimbs.The Cenomanian: stage of hindlimbed snakes Etymology The genus was named in honor of the late paleontologist Georg Haas, who first began work in the fossils of Ein Yabrud and started the description of the genus before he died, plus the Greek \\"ophis\\", for snake . The species names is from the Latin \\"terrasanctus\\" meaning \\"holy land\\". Specimen material H. terrasanctus is known from a single fossil discovered at Ein Yabrud in the Judean hills, near Ramallah, 20 km north of Jerusalem, in the central West Bank. This site also produced the type and only specimen for the sister genus Pachyrhachis. et al. 2003 \\"The Anatomy and Relationships of Haasiophis terrasanctus, a Fossil Snake with Well-Developed Hind Limbs from the Mid-Cretaceous of the Middle East\\" Journal of Paleontology 77(3):536-558 This site is a limestone carbonate which deposited in a low-energy marine platform environment. The only known specimen of H. terrasanctus, housed in the collections of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as specimen HUJ-Pal. EJ 695., measures 88 cm, missing only the tip of the tail, and is considered a small snake.  Skull  The skull is well preserved though slightly compressed. In the type description the cranium is described as showing a mix of basal characters, like those found in pipe snakes, and advanced traits found in macrostomatans. The cranium shows a small premaxilla which bears no teeth, while the maxilla, palatine, pterygoid, and dentar bones host 73-75 teeth. The preorbital area of the skull, being small and slender, is similar to the preorbital area of pythonine snakes. The contact between the prefrontal and frontal bones of the skull are very similar to ones found in the sister genus Pachyrhachis and the unrelated Dinilysia. Due to the tail of the specimen being missing, the total vertebrae is 199, plus fragments of a 200th, with the rib cage extending from the 5th to the 154th vertebrae. Lymphapophyses (forked 'cloacal' ribs) are found beginning on the 155th vertebrae and continuing to the 160th. The ribs from the 45-48th and 105-108th vertebrae show signs of pachyostosis, bony thickening and growth.  Hind limbs  Along with its sister genus Pachyrhachis, Haasiophis does not possess either a sacral rib or vertebrae. Also like Pachyrhachis there is no preserved indication of a connection between the vertebral column and the pelvic girdle. The pelvic girdle is partly obscured by overlaying bones reducing the detail which can be seen. Radiographs of the specimen reveal H. terrasanctus possessing a simple triradiate similar to that possessed by Pachyrhachis. Both femurs are preserved with the specimen, but the rest of the right leg is missing. The left zeugopodium, tarsus, tibia, and fibula are preserved though the tibia is disarticulated slightly. The foot is composed of three tarsal ossifications and five metatarsals. The tarsal ossifications do not show signs that the bones were connected to each other during life. Traces of two phalanges are discernible behind metatarsals two and three.  Taxonomic position  Several of the skeletal characters of Haasiophis may be interpreted as indication of Haasiophis being a juvenile specimen of Pachyrhachis. The small overall size, underdevelopment of the tarsal ossifications, less pachyostosis extent, and larger proportional size of the tibia and fibula are all possible traits of a juvenile. However the skull and tooth structures of Pachyrhachis and Haasiophis are markedly distinct. The neural spines of Pachyrhachis are much taller in comparison and the rib shape is quite distinct. Therefore, while regarded as being very close in relationship the two are different genera. Based on cladistic analysis of skull features, Haasiophis and its sister genera are indicated to be either a sister group to or basal members of the macrostomatan clade of snakes. This is supported by the general characteristics of the skeleton. The presence of the hind limbs presents a problem with this placement however. There are two major ideas for the presence of hind limbs in Pachyophiidae. The first is the secondary gaining of the limbs from legless ancestors, while the second is the possibility of multiple episodes of leg loss in snakes. Unfortunately the current number of specimens from the family Pachyophiidae, and the complexity of snake evolutionary taxonomy is not enough to favor one option over the other.

It is a relatively small snake, about 1 m (3‚Äì4 ft) long. Pachyrhachis appears to have been an ancient marine snake; the fossils occur in a marine limestone deposit, and the thickened bone of the ribs and vertebrae would have functioned as ballast to decrease the buoyancy of the animal, allowing it to dive beneath the ancient Cretaceous seas that it once inhabited. Pachyrhachis is one of three genera of Cenomanian snakes with hindlimbs. Although many modern pythons and boas still retain remnants of legs, in the form of small spurs, the tiny legs of Pachyrhachis included a hip, knee, and ankle joint. Pachyrhachis was originally described by Haas (1979, 1980) who noted it had a puzzling melange of snake and lizard features; its status as an early snake was later confirmed (Caldwell and Lee 1997). The position of Pachyrhachis within snakes has been debated (e.g. Lee and Scanlon 2002; Rieppel et al. 2003). Pachyrhachis is among the oldest known snakes and retains well- developed hind limbs, suggesting it represented a transitional form linking snakes to marine lizards (Lee and Scanlon 2002), though other studies place Pachyrhachis within the modern snake radiation Macrostomata (Zaher & Rieppel, 1999).

Life William Henry Bauer was born in New York City. He played ukulele and banjo as a child before switching to guitar. He played with the Jerry Wald band and recorded with Carl Hoff and His Orchestra in 1941 before joining Woody Herman in 1944 as a member of the First Herd. In 1946 he played with Benny Goodman and Jack Teagarden. Working in small groups led by bassist Chubby Jackson and trombonist Bill Harris, Bauer established himself as a soloist in the bebop movement. In 1946 he began working with Lennie Tristano. Tristano and Bauer enjoyed a natural synergy in their style and approach. Their development of \\"intuitive music\\" led to the 1949 session which included \\"Intuition\\", and \\"Digression\\". He was a member of the NBC Tonight Show band in New York City and played in the Today Show band at the start of early television. Bauer continued his pioneering guitar work in a partnership with Lee Konitz, whose avant-garde saxophone work was a perfect match for Bauer's guitar. The two musicians' dialogue crossed styles from bop and cool to the avant-garde. Their recordings have been described as \\"some of the most beautiful duet recordings in jazz\\". \\"Duet For Saxophone and Guitar\\" was an unusual instrument pairing which has been described as redefining the role of jazz guitar. Bauer made one album under his own name, Plectrist, in 1956. The CD reissue has been described as \\"demand[ing] the attention of anyone even remotely interested in jazz guitar\\". Later, he arranged the song \\"No One\\" that appeared on the CD Henry Golis Presents Good Music with Friends, which was released on Park Lane Drive Records in 2007. He died of pneumonia in New York, aged 89.https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/23/arts/music/billy-bauer-89-an-early- modern-jazz-guitarist-dies.html Teaching In later life Bauer taught at the New York Conservatory of Modern Music and his own Billy Bauer Guitar School, first in Albertson, New York, then in Roslyn Heights, New York. He also published instructional books on studying music and playing the guitar. Near the end of his career, Bauer appeared at the 1997 JVC Tributes for Barney Kessel and Tal Farlow. Bauer led the way for guitarists like Jimmy Raney and student Joe Satriani. In 1997 he published his autobiography Sideman (with Thea Luba; ).

Nepenthes faizaliana was formally described in 1991 by J. H. Adam and C. C. Wilcock. The description was published in the botanical journal Blumea. Nepenthes faizaliana was named after Muhammad Khairul Faizal, son of describing author J. H. Adam. In 1997, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek reduced N. faizaliana to a heterotypic synonym of N. stenophylla in their monograph on the genus.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997.

Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The pitcher mouth has an oblique insertion. The peristome is flattened, cylindrical in cross section, and up to 4 mm wide. The lid or operculum is orbicular and has a distinctive glandular crest on its underside. An unbranched spur is inserted near the base of the lid. An intermediate pitcher Nepenthes faizaliana has a racemose inflorescence. The female inflorescence of this species has not been formally described. In male inflorescences, the peduncle is up to 17 cm long, while the axis reaches 40 cm in length. Pedicels are one-flowered, up to 20 mm long, and typically possess bracts. Sepals are lanceolate to oblong in shape and up to 4 mm long. A study of 120 pollen samples taken from the type specimen (S 44163 (Lai & Jugah)) found the mean pollen diameter to be 32.3 Œºm (SE = 0.4; CV = 7.6%).Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1999. Palynological study of Bornean Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science 22(1): 1‚Äì7. Nepenthes faizaliana bears an indumentum of white, stellate hairs on its stem and petioles. The upper surface of the lamina is glabrous, whereas the underside has a sparse covering of short, branched hairs. In addition, long white hairs are present at the base of the midrib. Ecology Nepenthes faizaliana is endemic to the limestone peaks of Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak, Borneo. It typically occurs at altitudes of 1000 to 1600 m above sea level,McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. although it has been recorded from elevations as low as 400 m. N. faizaliana occurs both terrestrially and as an epiphyte on limestone outcrops and exposed ridge tops. It grows in close proximity to a number of other Nepenthes species, including N. stenophylla, N. tentaculata, and N. vogelii, but only one putative natural hybrid with N. veitchii has been recorded. Nepenthes faizaliana growing along the Pinnacles Trail on Mount Api Although most populations of N. faizaliana are remote and inaccessible to regular visitors, the species can be easily observed along the Pinnacles Trail on Mount Api.Steiner, H. 2002. Borneo: Its Mountains and Lowlands with their Pitcher Plants. Toihaan Publishing Company, Kota Kinabalu. Related species Nepenthes faizaliana belongs to the loosely defined \\"N. maxima complex\\", which also includes, among other species, N. boschiana, N. chaniana, N. epiphytica, N. eymae, N. fusca, N. klossii, N. maxima, N. platychila, N. stenophylla, and N. vogelii.Robinson, A.S., J. Nerz & A. Wistuba 2011. Nepenthes epiphytica, a new pitcher plant from East Kalimantan. In: McPherson, S.R. New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 36‚Äì51. Nepenthes faizaliana appears to be most closely related to N. boschiana. These two species differ in the extent of their indumentums; that of N. faizaliana is well developed and conspicuous, while mature plants of N. boschiana are virtually glabrous. In addition, the lower pitchers of N. boschiana tend to have a more bulbous base and a wider peristome. The upper pitchers are hard to distinguish, although those of N. boschiana usually have a wider mouth. Charles Clarke writes that these differences are \\"not major\\" and that \\"closer comparisons seem warranted\\". Nepenthes boschiana and N. faizaliana are both limestone endemics and occur on the highest limestone formations in Borneo: the Meratus Range and the cliffs of Gunung Mulu National Park, respectively. Nepenthes faizaliana is also similar to N. stenophylla, with which it was once synonymised. It differs from that species in having more lanceolate leaves, larger inflorescences, as well as a wider, more colourful and less recurved peristome. The flowers of N. faizaliana are borne singly on bracteate pedicels rather than on two-flowered partial peduncles. In addition, the glandular crest of N. faizaliana differs in shape and its lower pitchers are generally bulbous in the lower parts, unlike those of N. stenophylla. Some authors treat N. fallax in synonymy with N. stenophylla, while others consider them to be two distinct species, with plants commonly referred to as N. stenophylla actually representing N. fallax.Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes fallax. Carnivorous Plant Database.Schlauer, J. 1996. N.stenophylla, once again. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, May 31, 1996. Nepenthes faizaliana also bears a resemblance to N. fusca. In their description of the former, Adam and Wilcock distinguished these taxa on the basis of inflorescence structure, the size of the glandular region on the inner surface of upper pitchers, and the development and characteristics of the indumentum. In addition, N. faizaliana differs in having an orbicular pitcher lid, as opposed to the very narrow lid of N. fusca. References Further reading * Bourke, G. 2011.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 15, 2011 river in southern Monterey County and northern San Luis Obispo County, California. A large portion of the river's run is on military reservations. The river's upper reaches are inside Fort Hunter Liggett, Lake Nacimiento is in the middle and the lower reaches are inside Camp Roberts. It is the largest tributary of the Salinas River in terms of streamflow. History On September 24 and December 17, 1769, the Portol√† expedition crossed the river which they named Rio de las Truchas (Spanish for \\"trout\\"), saying \\"We pitched camp on the bank of a small river containing much running water, which, in several pools or eddies, held a considerable number of trout, and other species of fish.\\" Nacimiento, meaning \\"source of the river\\" in Spanish, was also given to the river by Father Juan Cresp√≠ of the Portol√† expedition September 21, 1769. Later the river was referred to as Nacimiento by Juan Bautista de Anza who on April 16, 1774, crossed the river and assumed wrongly that Nacimiento had been named for the nativity, also a Spanish translation. Course Rising south of Cone Peak, within the Ventana Wilderness of Los Padres National Forest in Monterey County, the Nacimiento River flows southeast through a rugged canyon before emerging in a large alluvial valley within Fort Hunter Liggett. After being joined by Stony Creek about west of Lockwood, the Nacimiento River flows through a series of remote canyons and narrow valleys along the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Range. Soon after crossing into San Luis Obispo County, the river flows into Lake Nacimiento, the largest reservoir in San Luis Obispo County, formed by Nacimiento Dam downstream. The reservoir is operated by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency and was built in 1957 to provides water for irrigation and groundwater recharge, drought protection, and to provide recreational opportunities such as swimming, boating, fishing and water skiing. Downstream from the dam, the Nacimiento River travels east for about until it joins the Salinas River at Camp Roberts, Monterey County. Except for its uppermost reaches and headwaters, as well as the short stretch below Nacimiento Dam, much of the river is dry in summer and fall, although perennial pools abound. Tributaries to the upper river include Little Burnett, Tabacco, Salmon, Las Berros, San Miguel, Stony, El Piojo, Waller, and Sapaque Creeks. Streams which flow into the lower river include Las Tablas, Franklin, Town, Dip, Snake, and Kavanaugh creeks. Additional main stem creeks include: Carrals Spring, Slickrock Creek, Stony Creek, San Miguel Creek, Upper Los Berros Creek, N. Fork Los Burros Creek, San Miguelitos Ranch, Gabilan Creek, Los Bueyes Creek, Lower Los Burros Creek, Oak Flat, Waller Creek, Mesa Coyote, Pozo Honda Creek, Turtle Creek and Gulch House Creek. Watershed The Nacimiento River watershed comprises , with about 54 percent in San Luis Obispo County and 46 percent in Monterey County. The crest of the Santa Lucia Range, part of the Coast Ranges, forms the southwestern boundary of the Nacimiento River watershed. The San Antonio River watershed divide forms its northeastern boundary. The San Antonio River, which feeds Lake San Antonio and is also a Salinas River tributary, mirrors the Nacimiento's path several miles to the northeast. About 46 percent of the watershed is agriculture and rangeland, with another 33.7 percent classified as open space, recreational or rural land. About 15.7 percent of the watershed is occupied by Camp Roberts and only 5 percent is urbanized. As of 2010, only about 3,000 people lived in the Nacimiento watershed. Annual precipitation ranges from in the valleys, to at the river's headwaters. Ecology The Nacimiento watershed includes several different types of California oak woodland communities, including blue oak, coast live oak, and valley oak mixed with foothill pine, manzanita and chaparral. Montane hardwood-conifer forests dominated by Coulter pine occur at higher elevations, primarily in the headwaters. Valley floors consist of a mix of native bunchgrass and needlegrass as well as non-native annual grasses seeded for grazing. Because most streams in the watershed are seasonal, there are only small areas of riparian and wetland habitat. The Cone Peak Gradient Research Natural Area located near the source of the Nacimiento River is an area unusual for its ecological diversity and presence of the rare Santa Lucia fir (Abies bracteata). Threatened and endangered species in the watershed including the arroyo toad (Bufo californicus), western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus). The Nacimiento River historically comprised some of the best steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) spawning and rearing habitats in the Salinas River watershed. The Nacimiento Dam was constructed without fish passage and the historic habitats above these dams are no longer available to steelhead.

The stem of N. mapuluensis can measure up to 6 mm in diameter, but the maximum length is unknown. Internodes are cylindrical and up to 4 cm long. The leaves are coriaceous. The lamina is oblanceolate-linear in morphology, up to 26 cm long, and 5 cm wide. The apex of the lamina is acute, while the base is attenuate, sub-petiolate, and semi-amplexicaul. Tendrils grow to 50 cm in length. The pitchers of N. mapuluensis are ellipsoidal in shape. They grow to 21 cm in height and 8.5 cm in diameter. The pitchers possess two fringed wings up to 10 mm wide. The peristome of this species is moderately developed and is folded or wavy as in the closely related N. northiana. The peristome may be up to 12 mm wide and bears a row of distinct, but not pronounced, teeth. Aerial or upper pitchers may be infundibular throughout, but are often cylindrical and relatively small.Lee, C.C. 2007. Re: Has anybody seen N. mapuluensis in nature? Carnivorous Plants in the tropics. They bear reduced fringed wings or ribs. Nepenthes mapuluensis has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 7 cm long. The size of the rachis is unknown. Pedicels grow to 8 mm in length. A study of 120 pollen samples taken from the type specimen (Kostermans 14017) found the mean pollen diameter to be 28.9 Œºm (SE = 0.5; CV = 9.2%).Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1999. Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science 22(1): 1‚Äì7. The species is mostly glabrous, although certain parts of the plant, such as the pitchers, may have a scattered indumentum of short hairs. Ecology The type locality of N. mapuluensis is described on the original collector's label, which reads: \\"the species is common on the limestone mountain of Ilas Mapulu at an altitude of 800 m\\". The population from which the type specimen originated was subsequently destroyed and for some time the species was thought to be extinct.Nerz, J. 1994. Nepenthes-discussion. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List. More recently, however, further observations of N. mapuluensis have been made by Troy Davis, Joachim Nerz and Andreas Wistuba, significantly expanding the known range of this species. This being the case, N. mapuluensis is thought to be endemic to the Sambaliung mountain range in East Kalimantan. Nepenthes mapuluensis is restricted to limestone substrates and grows in stunted vegetation on low summit ridges, which are often extremely inaccessible. It has been recorded from elevations of between 50 and 850 m. Related species Nepenthes mapuluensis is very similar to N. northiana and there is some question as to the validity of its species status. Although there are few morphological characters separating these two taxa, there seem to be several stable differences that can be used to distinguish between them. Compared to N. northiana, the leaves on the climbing stems of N. mapuluensis are more linear, the pitchers darker in colour, and the upper pitchers narrower. It is also worth noting that N. northiana is known only from the Bau area of Sarawak, which lies several hundred kilometres away from the only known populations of N. mapuluensis. In his Carnivorous Plant Database, taxonomist Jan Schlauer treats N. mapuluensis as a possible synonym of N. northiana. Cultivation Nepenthes mapuluensis is extremely rare in cultivation. It has been artificially crossed with N. ventricosa to produce the hybrid Nepenthes √ó mapulucosa Hort.Westphal in sched. (2000), although this name is a nomen nudum.

Hoard played professional football as a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons for the Cleveland Browns from 1990 to 1995 and the Minnesota Vikings from 1996 to 1999. He also played briefly for the Carolina Panthers (three games) and Baltimore Ravens (two games) during the 1996 NFL season. In a 10-year NFL career, Hoard appeared in 144 games, totaled 3,964 rushing yards and 2,430 receiving yards and scored 51 touchdowns. Hoard also played college football as a fullback and tailback for the University of Michigan from 1987 to 1989. After rushing for 146 yards and two touchdowns against USC, he was selected as the most valuable player in the 1989 Rose Bowl. Hoard gained 1,706 rushing yards on 314 carries (5.4 yards per carry), caught 30 passes for 199 yards, and scored 19 touchdowns at Michigan.

The highlight of Hoard's college career was being named most valuable player of the 1989 Rose Bowl, after rushing for 146 yards and two touchdowns in Michigan's win over USC. He also rushed for 165 yards and two touchdowns in the 1988 Michigan-Ohio State game. For the entire 1988 season, Hoard rushed for 752 yards and 11 touchdowns.(to retrieve Hoard's statistics, enter \\"hoard\\" in the box for the player's last name) As a junior, Hoard started five games at fullback and three games at tailback for the 1989 Michigan team that compiled a 10-2 record, won a second consecutive Big Ten championship, lost to USC in the 1990 Rose Bowl (despite 108 rushing yard from Hoard), and finished the season ranked No. 7 in the final AP Poll. Hoard rushed for 832 yards and six touchdowns during the 1989 season. Hoard decided to forgo his last season of college eligibility and enter the NFL Draft. Professional career =Cleveland Browns= Hoard was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the second round (45th overall pick) of the 1990 NFL Draft. He played six seasons for the Browns from 1990 to 1995, appearing in 90 games, including 54 as a starter. During the 1991 NFL season, Hoard appeared in all 16 games for the Browns (nine as a starter) and compiled 721 combined receiving and rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He continued with strong performances in 1992 (546 rushing/receiving yards) and 1993 (578 rushing/receiving yards). He had his best season in 1994, rushing for 890 yards, catching 45 passes for 445 yards, and scoring nine touchdowns. He was also selected to play in the 1994 Pro Bowl. In his final year with the Browns, Hoard had another strong season with 850 combined rushing/receiving yards. =Ravens and Panthers= The Browns became the Baltimore Ravens in 1996, but Hoard was released in late September after appearing in two games for the Ravens with 61 rushing yards on 15 carries. One week after being released by the Ravens, Hoard signed with the Carolina Panthers to replace the injured Tshimanga Biakabutuka. He appeared in three games for the Panthers, all as a backup, and carried the ball only five times for 11 yards. He was released by the Panthers in late October 1996. =Minnesota Vikings= On November 5, 1996, after an injury to Minnesota Vikings running back Robert Smith, Hoard signed with the Vikings. He immediately became a starter for the Vikings, starting the last six games of the 1996 season with 420 rushing yards, 129 receiving yards and three touchdowns. Pleased with Hoard's performance, the Vikings, in March 1997, signed Hoard to a two-year contract at $1.6 million. Hoard remained with the Vikings through the 1999 NFL season. He had some of his best years with the Vikings. In 1998, he had 667 combined rushing/receiving yards and scored nine rushing touchdowns and one receiving touchdown. He also was responsible for the longest conversion in NFL history, 3rd and 37 on a draw play vs the Denver Broncos In 1999, he scored a career- high 10 rushing touchdowns and finished the year with 721 combined rushing/receiving yards. He also had a career-high three touchdowns in the Vikings' 41-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in the 1998‚Äì99 NFL playoffs. Hoard was known as a \\"goal-line\\" running back who excelled at breaking through an opposing defense's goal-line defenses. Regarding his skills, Hoard reportedly once said to his coach, \\"Coach, if you need one yard, I'll get you three yards. If you need five yards, I'll get you three yards.\\" Broadcasting career =790 The Ticket (WAXY)= Leroy Hoard is part of the morning drive radio show on WAXY 790 AM in South Florida with hosts Brendan Tobin and Brian ‚ÄúThe Beast‚Äù London from 6 AM to 10 AM EST.

Noopolitik as global information strategy // Vestnik St.Petersburg University, Ser. 9. 2012. Issue. I. p. 207-213 Noopolitik differs from realpolitik. Although realpolitik is commonly equated with hard power, and seemingly noopolitik with soft power, both are broader in their embodiment of a form of organization. Specifically, realpolitik is not limited to hard power and coercion, but embodies a hierarchical form of organization. Likewise, noopolitik is not limited to reliance on knowledge and soft power, but embodies a networked form of organization. Versus Foucault's Biopolitics Tiziana Terranova (2007) describes the use of the term 'noopolitics' by Maurizio Lazzarato (2004). \\"'Noopolitics' supplements the biopolitics of the species described by Foucault\\" (Terranova 2007, 139). \\"Against the militarization of communication accomplished by new techniques of power, it is possible to think about the constitution of such publics as counter-weapons, which work by expressing, inventing and creating possible worlds where the moment of resistance (the 'no' by which one refuses to watch, listen or believe) is the starting point for an affirmative activity\\" (Terranova 2007, 140).

Thus Noopolitik may be defined as the use of innovation and knowledge to leverage political intercourses by other means at the international level.

Many components were considered in ancient Greek medicine, intertwining the spiritual with the physical. Specifically, the ancient Greeks believed health was affected by the humors, geographic location, social class, diet, trauma, beliefs, and mindset. Early on the ancient Greeks believed that illnesses were \\"divine punishments\\" and that healing was a \\"gift from the Gods\\". As trials continued wherein theories were tested against symptoms and results, the pure spiritual beliefs regarding \\"punishments\\" and \\"gifts\\" were replaced with a foundation based in the physical, i.e., cause and effect. Humorism (or the four humors) refers to blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. It was also theorized that sex played a role in medicine because some diseases and treatments were different for females than for males. Moreover, geographic location and social class affected the living conditions of the people and might subject them to different environmental issues such as mosquitoes, rats, and availability of clean drinking water. Diet was thought to be an issue as well and might be affected by a lack of access to adequate nourishment. Trauma, such as that suffered by gladiators, from dog bites or other injuries, played a role in theories relating to understanding anatomy and infections. Additionally, there was significant focus on the beliefs and mindset of the patient in the diagnosis and treatment theories. It was recognized that the mind played a role in healing, or that it might also be the sole basis for the illness.Bendick, Jeanne. \\"Galen ‚Äì And the Gateway to Medicine.\\" Ignatius Press, San Francisco, CA, 2002. . Ancient Greek medicine began to revolve around the theory of humors. The humoral theory states that good health comes from a perfect balance of the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Consequently, poor health resulted from improper balance of the four humors . Hippocrates, known as the \\"Father of Modern Medicine\\", established a medical school at Cos and is the most important figure in ancient Greek medicine.Atlas of Anatomy, ed. Giunti Editorial Group, Taj Books LTD 2002, p. 9 Hippocrates and his students documented numerous illnesses in the Hippocratic Corpus, and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still in use today. The contributions to ancient Greek medicine of Hippocrates, Socrates and others had a lasting influence on Islamic medicine and medieval European medicine until many of their findings eventually became obsolete in the 14th century. The earliest known Greek medical school opened in Cnidus in 700 BC. Alcmaeon, author of the first anatomical compilation, worked at this school, and it was here that the practice of observing patients was established. Despite their known respect for Egyptian medicine, attempts to discern any particular influence on Greek practice at this early time have not been dramatically successful because of the lack of sources and the challenge of understanding ancient medical terminology. It is clear, however, that the Greeks imported Egyptian substances into their pharmacopoeia, and the influence became more pronounced after the establishment of a school of Greek medicine in Alexandria.Heinrich von Staden, Herophilus: The Art of Medicine in Early Alexandria (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), pp. 1-26. Asclepieia Rod of Asclepius View of the Asklepieion of Kos, the best preserved instance of an Asclepieion. Asclepius was espoused as the first physician, and myth placed him as the son of Apollo. Temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as Asclepieia (; sing. ·ºàœÉŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÄŒπŒµ·øñŒøŒΩ Asclepieion), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.Risse, G. B. Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals. Oxford University Press, 1990. p. 56 At these shrines, patients would enter a dream-like state of induced sleep known as \\"enkoimesis\\" () not unlike anesthesia, in which they either received guidance from the deity in a dream or were cured by surgery.Askitopoulou, H., Konsolaki, E., Ramoutsaki, I., Anastassaki, E. Surgical cures by sleep induction as the Asclepieion of Epidaurus. The mistory of anesthesia: proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium, by Jos√© Carlos Diz, Avelino Franco, Douglas R. Bacon, J. Rupreht, Juli√°n Alvarez. Elsevier Science B.V., International Congress Series 1242(2002), p.11-17. Asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing. The Temple of Asclepius in Pergamum had a spring that flowed down into an underground room in the Temple. People would come to drink the waters and to bathe in them because they were believed to have medicinal properties. Mud baths and hot teas such as chamomile were used to calm them or peppermint tea to soothe their headaches, which is still a home remedy used by many today. The patients were encouraged to sleep in the facilities too. Their dreams were interpreted by the doctors and their symptoms were then reviewed. Dogs would occasionally be brought in to lick open wounds for assistance in their healing. In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, but with the patient in a state of enkoimesis induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium. The Rod of Asclepius is a universal symbol for medicine to this day. However, it is frequently confused with Caduceus, which was a staff wielded by the god Hermes. The Rod of Asclepius embodies one snake with no wings whereas Caduceus is represented by two snakes and a pair of wings depicting the swiftness of Hermes. Ancient Greek physicians Ancient Greek physicians regarded disease as being of supernatural origin, brought about from the dissatisfaction of the gods or from demonic possession. The fault of the ailment was placed on the patient and the role of the physician was to conciliate with the gods or exorcise the demon with prayers, spells, and sacrifices. The Hippocratic Corpus and Humorism Hippocratic corpus. Thessaloniki Technology Museum The Hippocratic Corpus opposes ancient beliefs, offering biologically based approaches to disease instead of magical intervention. The Hippocratic Corpus is a collection of about seventy early medical works from ancient Greece that are associated with Hippocrates and his students. Although once thought to have been written by Hippocrates himself, many scholars today believe that these texts were written by a series of authors over several decades.Vivian Nutton'Ancient Medicine'(Routledge 2004) The Corpus contains the treatise, the Sacred Disease, which argues that if all diseases were derived from supernatural sources, biological medicines would not work. The establishment of the humoral theory of medicine focused on the balance between blood, yellow and black bile, and phlegm in the human body. Being too hot, cold, dry or wet disturbed the balance between the humors, resulting in disease and illness. Gods and demons were not believed to punish the patient, but attributed to bad air (miasma theory). Physicians who practiced humoral medicine focused on reestablishing balance between the humors. The shift from supernatural disease to biological disease did not completely abolish Greek religion, but offered a new method of how physicians interacted with patients. Ancient Greek physicians who followed humorism emphasized the importance of environment. Physicians believed patients would be subjected to various diseases based on the environment they resided. The local water supply and the direction the wind blew influenced the health of the local populace. Patients played an important role in their treatment. Stated in the treatise \\"Aphorisms\\", \\"[i]t is not enough for the physician to do what is necessary, but the patient and the attendant must do their part as well\\". Patient compliance was rooted in their respect for the physician. According to the treatise \\"Prognostic\\", a physician was able to increase their reputation and respect through \\"prognosis\\", knowing the outcome of the disease. Physicians had an active role in the lives of patients, taking into consideration their residence. Distinguishing between fatal diseases and recoverable disease was important for patient trust and respect, positively influencing patient compliance. Asclepius (center) arrives in Kos and is greeted by Hippocrates (left) and a citizen (right), mosaic from the Asclepieion of Kos, 2nd-3rd century AD With the growth of patient compliance in Greek medicine, consent became an important factor between the doctor and patient relationship. Presented with all the information concerning the patient's health, the patient makes the decision to accept treatment. Physician and patient responsibility is mentioned in the treatise \\"Epidemics\\", where it states, \\"there are three factors in the practice of medicine: the disease, the patient and the physician. The physician is the servant of science, and the patient must do what he can to fight the disease with the assistance of the physician\\". Aristotle's influence on Greek perception Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was the most influential scholar of the living world from antiquity. Aristotle's biological writings demonstrate great concern for empiricism, biological causation, and the diversity of life.Mason, A History of the Sciences pp 41 Aristotle did not experiment, however, holding that items display their real natures in their own environments, rather than controlled artificial ones. While in modern-day physics and chemistry this assumption has been found unhelpful, in zoology and ethology it remains the dominant practice, and Aristotle's work \\"retains real interest\\".Annas, Classical Greek Philosophy pp 247 He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. Aristotle believed that formal causes guided all natural processes.Mayr, The Growth of Biological Thought, pp 84-90, 135; Mason, A History of the Sciences, p 41-44 Such a teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design; for example suggesting that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and generally giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man‚Äîthe scala naturae or Great Chain of Being.Mayr, The Growth of Biological Thought, pp 201-202; see also: Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being He held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not foreordained by that form. Yet another aspect of his biology divided souls into three groups: a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth; a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation; and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection. He attributed only the first to plants, the first two to animals, and all three to humans.Aristotle, De Anima II 3 Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, and like the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.Mason, A History of the Sciences pp 45 Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon.Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy Vol. 1 pp. 348 Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany‚Äîthe History of Plants‚Äîwhich survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpium for seed vessel. Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the efficient cause. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.Mayr, The Growth of Biological Thought, pp 90-91; Mason, A History of the Sciences, p 46 The biological/teleological ideas of Aristotle and Theophrastus, as well as their emphasis on a series of axioms rather than on empirical observation, cannot be easily separated from their consequent impact on Western medicine. Herophilus and Erasistratus Frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of Theophrastus's Historia Plantarum (c. 1200), which was originally written around 200 BC After Theophrastus (d. 286 BC), the extent of original work produced was diminished. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.Annas, Classical Greek Philosophy pp 252 It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found. The first medical teacher at Alexandria was Herophilus of Chalcedon, who differed from Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter had a pulse while the former do not. He did this using an experiment involving cutting certain veins and arteries in a pig's neck until the squealing stopped.Mason, A History of the Sciences pp 56 In the same vein, he developed a diagnostic technique which relied upon distinguishing different types of pulse.Barnes, Hellenistic Philosophy and Science pp 383 He, and his contemporary, Erasistratus of Chios, researched the role of veins and nerves, mapping their courses across the body. Erasistratus connected the increased complexity of the surface of the human brain compared to other animals to its superior intelligence. He sometimes employed experiments to further his research, at one time repeatedly weighing a caged bird and noting its weight loss between feeding times. Following his teacher's researches into pneumatics, he claimed that the human system of blood vessels was controlled by vacuums, drawing blood across the body. In Erasistratus' physiology, air enters the body, is then drawn by the lungs into the heart, where it is transformed into vital spirit, and is then pumped by the arteries throughout the body. Some of this vital spirit reaches the brain, where it is transformed into animal spirit, which is then distributed by the nerves.Mason, A History of the Sciences, p 57 Herophilus and Erasistratus performed their experiments upon criminals given to them by their Ptolemaic kings. They dissected these criminals alive, and \\"while they were still breathing they observed parts which nature had formerly concealed, and examined their position, colour, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, connection.\\"Barnes, Hellenistic Philosophy and Science, pp 383-384 Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. In the words of Ernst Mayr, \\"Nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.\\"Mayr, The Growth of Biological Thought, pp 90-94; quotation from p 91 Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.Annas, Classical Greek Philosophy, p 252 Galen Aelius Galenus was a prominent Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher in the Roman Empire.\\"Life, death, and entertainment in the Roman Empire\\".

University of Michigan Press. p. 63. \\"Galen on bloodletting: a study of the origins, development, and validity of his opinions, with a translation of the three works\\". Peter Brain, Galen (1986). Cambridge University Press. p.1. Arguably the most accomplished of all medical researchers of antiquity, Galen influenced the development of various scientific disciplines, including anatomy, physiology, pathology,Arthur John Brock (translator), Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties. Edinburgh 1916 pharmacology,Galen on pharmacology and neurology, as well as philosophyGalen on the brain and logic. The son of Aelius Nicon, a wealthy architect with scholarly interests, Galen received a comprehensive education that prepared him for a successful career as a physician and philosopher. Born in Pergamon (present-day Bergama, Turkey), Galen traveled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in Rome, where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several emperors. Galen's understanding of anatomy and medicine was principally influenced by the then-current theory of humorism, as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as Hippocrates. His theories dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports, based mainly on dissection of monkeys, especially the Barbary macaque, and pigs, remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work De humani corporis fabrica by Andreas VesaliusO'Malley, C., Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514‚Äì1564, Berkeley: University of California Press where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations.Siraisi, Nancy G., (1991) Girolamo Cardano and the Art of Medical Narrative, Journal of the History of Ideas. pp. 587‚Äì88. Galen's theory of the physiology of the circulatory system endured until 1628, when William Harvey published his treatise entitled De motu cordis, in which he established that blood circulates, with the heart acting as a pump.Furley, D, and J. Wilkie, 1984, Galen On Respiration and the Arteries, Princeton University Press, and Bylebyl, J (ed), 1979, William Harvey and His Age, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press Medical students continued to study Galen's writings until well into the 19th century. Galen conducted many nerve ligation experiments that supported the theory, which is still accepted today, that the brain controls all the motions of the muscles by means of the cranial and peripheral nervous systems.Frampton, M., 2008, Embodiments of Will: Anatomical and Physiological Theories of Voluntary Animal Motion from Greek Antiquity to the Latin Middle Ages, 400 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 1300, Saarbr√ºcken: VDM Verlag. pp. 180 ‚Äì 323 Galen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, as he wrote in his treatise entitled That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher.Brian, P., 1977, \\"Galen on the ideal of the physician\\", South Africa Medical Journal, 52: 936‚Äì938 pdf Galen was very interested in the debate between the rationalist and empiricist medical sects,Frede, M. and R. Walzer, 1985, Three Treatises on the Nature of Science, Indianapolis: Hacket. and his use of direct observation, dissection and vivisection represents a complex middle ground between the extremes of those two viewpoints. Dioscorides The first century AD Greek physician, pharmacologist, botanist, and Roman army surgeon Pedanius Dioscorides authored an encyclopedia of medicinal substances commonly known as De Materia Medica. This work did not delve into medical theory or explanation of pathogenesis, but described the uses and actions of some 600 substances, based on empirical observation. Unlike other works of Classical antiquity, Dioscorides' manuscript was never out of publication; it formed the basis for the Western pharmacopeia through the 19th century, a true testament to the efficacy of the medicines described; moreover, the influence of work on European herbal medicine eclipsed that of the Hippocratic Corpes. Historical legacy Through long contact with Greek culture, and their eventual conquest of Greece, the Romans adopted a favorable view of Hippocratic medicine.Heinrich von Staden, \\"Liminal Perils: Early Roman Receptions of Greek Medicine\\", in Tradition, Transmission, Transformation, ed. F. Jamil Ragep and Sally P. Ragep with Steven Livesey (Leiden: Brill, 1996), pp. 369-418. This acceptance led to the spread of Greek medical theories throughout the Roman Empire, and thus a large portion of the West. The most influential Roman scholar to continue and expand on the Hippocratic tradition was Galen (d. c. 207). Study of Hippocratic and Galenic texts, however, all but disappeared in the Latin West in the Early Middle Ages, following the collapse of the Western Empire, although the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition of Greek medicine continued to be studied and practiced in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium). After AD 750, Arab, Persian and Andalusi scholars translated Galen's and Dioscorides' works in particular. Thereafter the Hippocratic-Galenic medical tradition was assimilated and eventually expanded, with the most influential Muslim doctor- scholar being Avicenna. Beginning in the late eleventh century, the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition returned to the Latin West with a series of translations of the Classical texts, mainly from Arabic translations but occasionally from the original Greek. In the Renaissance, more translations of Galen and Hippocrates directly from the Greek were made from newly available Byzantine manuscripts. Galen's influence was so great that even after Western Europeans started making dissections in the thirteenth century, scholars often assimilated findings into the Galenic model that otherwise might have thrown Galen's accuracy into doubt. Over time, however, Classical medical theory came to be superseded by increasing emphasis on scientific experimental methods in the 16th and 17th centuries. Nevertheless, the Hippocratic-Galenic practice of bloodletting was practiced into the 19th century, despite its empirical ineffectiveness and riskiness.

St. John's, the provincial capital, is to the southeast. Random Island is located off Canada's Atlantic coast. Part of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, it is located on the east coast of Newfoundland and partially surrounded by the Bonavista Peninsula on the north and within the confines of Trinity Bay. The island is approximately long, its width varies from on the eastern end, to in the middle, to on the western end, with a total area of around . According to the 2016 census, the population of the island is 1,232. Geography Situated in northwest Trinity Bay, it is separated from Newfoundland by Smith Sound on the north and the North West Arm of Random Sound on the south and west. It is not circumnavigable except by small boats, as Random Bar (a bar that runs from its northwest corner to Newfoundland) separates the two sounds. The Hefferton Causeway (now Route 231 (Random Island Road)) was built in 1954 across Random Bar, linking the island with the nearby town of Clarenville. Education Random Island has one school, Random Island Academy (was Random Island integrated), which educates students from kindergarten to Grade 12. The school's student body has been steadily declining since its high of 445 students in 1982, and by 1996 it had only 213 students. In the 2005/06 school year, the Eastern School District was considering shutting Random Island Academy down in the year 2009 because of its small population. The school is still running now. it currently has 115 students. Random Island Academy was founded in 1973, and originally only served the younger students. High school students had been bused across Random Bar to Clarenville before 1973. However, due to parents' protests, the Academy was eventually upgraded to accommodate all students. Communities Random Island consists of the following eleven communities: *Random Heights *Elliott's Cove *Snooks Harbour *Aspen Brook *Weybridge *Lady Cove *Robinson Bight *Hickman's Harbour *Britannia *Lower Lance Cove *Petley These communities have undergone name changes over the history of the island, and in some cases have become somewhat consolidated. For example, Petley includes the area known as Aspen (Apsey) Cove, often considered its own community, and Weybridge has in the past been known as Fosters Point. Most of these communities, despite their tiny size, have histories of over 100 years. However, Random Heights and Robinson Bight are relatively recent in their development as communities. Other communities have ceased to exist due to natural or artificial conditions. Ryder's Harbour is considered one of the founding communities, but ceased to exist due to natural evolution away from it, while Deer Harbour was a victim of government resettlement policies in the 1960s. History Random Island's first permanent settlement, Ryder's Harbour, was founded in the 1760s. The site, located at the northeastern terminus of the island, was previously visited often by the many fishing expeditions from Trinity. Deer Harbor and Thoroughfare were settled nearby in the 1800s as fishing traffic to Random Island grew. On the western side of the island, settlers began arriving in the 1850s, mostly from the southern end of Trinity Bay. Soon thereafter, settlement took place on the southern portion of island, becoming Hickman's Harbour. By 1900, Hickman's Harbour, the site of the best deep-water anchorage, had become the centre of the Random Island fishing and shipbuilding industries. Other methods of employment include sawmilling and slate mining, though the actual quarry was across the sound in Nut Cove. This quarry was closed in 1907, though it reopened in 1990. In western Random Island, the communities were primarily based on clay mining for brickmaking, and later, shale. The population of Random Island had risen to past 1000 by 1901, with Hickman's Harbour being the most populous community at 309 people. However, the industries that had supported Random Island for over a hundred years began to collapse in the early 20th century. Both slate quarrying and fishing had declined drastically, and as a result, shipbuilding and sawmilling also went down. Many residents moved to nearby Clarenville, while others were commuted off the island for their employment. Constructing the Hefferton Causeway, followed by road upgrades, greatly facilitated travel to Clarenville and the rest of Newfoundland. Deer Harbour and Thoroughfare were resettled when it was decided in the 1960s not to link them to the roads. The population continued to rise slowly, and in 1986 the island's population reached just over 1500. Hickman's Harbour continued to be the largest community, with a population of 479. Apart from some fishing and sawmilling, few residents were employed on Random Island itself, more working at Clarenville or farther afield.

United States civil defense refers to the use of civil defense in the history of the United States, which is the organized non-military effort to prepare Americans for military attack. Late in the 20th century, the term and practice of civil defense fell into disuse. Emergency management and homeland security replaced them. History =Pre‚ÄìWorld War= There is little history of civil defense in the United States before the twentieth century. Since ancient times, cities typically built walls and moats to protect from invasion and commissioned patrols and watches to keep an eye out for danger, but such activities have not traditionally been encompassed by the term \\"civil defense.\\" The U.S. has a particular lack of early civil defense efforts because the American homeland was seldom threatened with a significant attack. Despite these considerations, there are still examples of what would today be considered civil defense. For example, as early as 1692, the village of Bedford, New York kept a paid drummer on staff, who was charged with sounding the town drum in the event of a Native American attack‚Äîa very early precursor to the wailing sirens of the Cold War.Towne, Robert, Stamford Historical Society. \\"Record Group 11: Civil Defense in Stamford.\\" 1996. The Stamford Historical Society, Record Group 11, Civil War Defence in Stamford = World War I = Civil defense truly began to come of age, both worldwide and in the United States, during the first World War‚Äîalthough it was usually referred to as civilian defense. This was the first major total war, which required the involvement and support of the general population. Strategic bombing during World War I brought bombing raids by dirigibles and airplanes, with thousands of injuries and deaths. Attacks on non-combat ships, like the Lusitania, presented another threat to non combatants. The British responded with an organized effort which was soon copied in the US. This was formalized with the creation of the Council of National Defense on August 29, 1916. Civil defense responsibilities at the federal level were vested in this council, with subsidiary councils at the state and local levels providing additional support‚Äîa multi-level structure which was to remain throughout the history of United States civil defense. As the United States had little threat of a direct attack on its shores, the organization instead \\"maintained anti-saboteur vigilance, encouraged men to join the armed forces, facilitated the implementation of the draft, participated in Liberty Bond drives, and helped to maintain the morale of the soldiers.\\"Kerr, Thomas J. \\"Civil Defense in the U.S.\\" Westview Press (Boulder, CO): 1983. p. 12. . Quoted at . This freedom to focus beyond air raid attacks gave United States civil defense a much broader scope than elsewhere. With the end of military conflict, the activities of the Council of National Defense were suspended.Green, Walter G., editor. \\"Council of National Defense and State Defense Councils.\\" Electronic Encyclopaedia of Civil Defense and Emergency Management. 2003. Thus, World War I marked the first time that organized civil defense was practised on a large scale in the United States. Although civil defense had not yet reached the scale and significance it soon would, many of the basic features were set in place. =World War II= Handbooks, guides, and bulletins showing the variety of opportunities for civilian defense volunteers during WWII World War II, which the United States entered after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, was characterized by a significantly greater use of civil defense. Even before the attack, the Council of National Defense was reactivated by President Roosevelt and created the Division of State and Local Cooperation to further assist the Council's efforts.Suburban Emergency Management Project, \\"SEMP Biot #243: What Is Civil Defense? World War I through the Eisenhower Administration,\\" 8/1/05. Thus, the civil defense of World War II began very much as a continuation of that of World War I. Very soon, however, the idea of local and state councils bearing a significant burden became viewed as untenable and more responsibility was vested at the federal level with the creation of the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) within the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP) in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) on May 20, 1941. The OCD was originally headed by New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and was charged with promoting protective measures and elevating national morale. These organizations and others worked together to mobilize the civilian population in response to the threat. The Civil Air Patrol (CAP), which was created just days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, commissioned civilian pilots to patrol the coast and borders and engage in search and rescue missions as needed. The Civil Defense Corps, run by the OCD, organized approximately 10 million volunteers who trained to fight fires, decontaminate after chemical weapon attacks, provide first aid, and other duties. A Ground Observer Corps watched for enemy aircraft. These efforts did not replace the kinds of civil defense that took place during World War I. Indeed, World War II saw an even greater use of rationing, recycling, and anti-saboteur vigilance than was seen in World War I. As the threat of air raids or invasions in the United States seemed less likely during the war, the focus on the Civil Defense Corps, air raid drills, and patrols of the border declined but the other efforts continued. Unlike the end of World War I, the US did not dismiss all its civil defense efforts as soon as World War II ended. Instead, they continued after the end of the war and served as the foundation of civil defense in the Cold War. =Cold War= This 1950 atomic bomb information card, meant for U.S. military personnel, describes how in a number of respects an \\"Atomic bomb (\\"A-bomb\\") is similar to the effects of a large High explosive (\\"HE\\" bomb). While easily misinterpreted as dismissing the post-explosion radiation hazard, the pamphlet mentions the radiation hazard being over after the \\"debris has stopped falling\\" because then, the prompt radiation hazard has largely passed. Furthermore, written before the era of the Hydrogen bomb (1951) and atomic demolition munitions, the pamphlet does not discuss nuclear fallout as the pamphlet was created at a time when the only conceivable means by which soldiers would encounter nuclear explosions, was when they were air bursts, which does not produce militarily significant fallout. The new dimensions of nuclear war terrified the world and the American people. The sheer power of nuclear weapons and the perceived likelihood of such an attack on the United States precipitated a greater response than had yet been required of civil defense. Civil defense, something previously considered an important and common-sense step, also became divisive and controversial in the charged atmosphere of the Cold War. In 1950, the National Security Resources Board created a 162-page document outlining a model civil defense structure for the US. Called the \\"Blue Book\\" by civil defense professionals in reference to its solid blue cover, it was the template for legislation and organization that occurred over the next 40 years.National Security Resources Board. United States Civil Defense. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), 1950. . Despite a general agreement on the importance of civil defense, Congress never came close to meeting the budget requests of federal civil defense agencies. Throughout the Cold War, civil defense was characterized by fits and starts. Indeed, the responsibilities were passed through a myriad of agencies, and specific programs were often boosted and scrapped in a similar manner to US ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems with which it was seen as complementary. In declassified US war game analyses of the late 1950‚Äì60s, it was estimated that approximately 27 million US citizens would have been saved with civil defense education in the event of a Soviet pre-emptive strike.Net Evaluation Subcommittee. p. 27 At the time however the cost of a full-scale civil defense program was, in cost-benefit analysis, deemed less effective than a BMD system, and as the adversary was increasing their nuclear stockpile, both programs would yield diminishing returns. Civil defense literature such as Survival Under Atomic Attack was common during the Cold War Era. Educational efforts One aspect of the Cold War civil defense program was the educational effort made or promoted by the government. One primary way in which they did this was the publication and production of federally funded films that were distributed to the mass public. In Duck and Cover, Bert the Turtle advocated that children \\"duck and cover\\" when they \\"see the flash\\". In this film, children are instructed to \\"kneel with their backs facing the windows, eyes shut, their hands clasped behind their backs.\\" Duck and Cover also reached audiences through printed media and radio waves. This included a 14-minute radio adaptation, a 16-page coloring booklet, and a nationwide newspaper serialization. The image of Bert the Turtle was often seen as a way to defuse tensions related to nuclear weapons. The creators of the cartoon \\"were forced to pick their way delicately through overly glib depictions of nuclear war on one hand, and terrifying descriptions prescribing hysteria and panic on the other.\\" Thus, children were able to adapt to a world of panic and come to terms with the existence of the bomb while also learning how to prepare for the possibility of nuclear disaster. Another educational program, produced by the Federal Civil Defense Administration, was Survival Under Atomic Attack. Produced in both film and print, Survival gave Americans information on how to prepare themselves and their homes in the case of a nuclear attack. The film showed citizens how the whole family can get involved in final moments of preparation if they were to hear the warning sirens that alerted them of an incoming attack. Along with popularity of the film, over a million copies of the Survival booklet sold within its first year of publication in 1951. Audiences of both the film and print sources learned specific skills on how to ensure their safety in the case of emergency. This included preparing a first aid kit, storing plenty of water and canned goods, stocking up on batteries for radios and flashlights, and equipping a fallout shelter that they could access easily and safely. \\"Alert America\\" also sought to teach the American public how to prepare for instances of emergency and the threat of atomic attack. Created in December 1951, the \\"Alert America\\" program consisted of three convoys with ten thirty-two-foot trailer trucks that traveled 36,000 miles throughout the nation's 82 major cities and attracted 1.1 million people. While displaying products and information to educate people on the affects and preparedness associated with nuclear weapons, the \\"Alert America\\" program also showed federally supported films such as Duck and Cover, Survival Under Atomic Attack, and Our Cities Must Fight.Our Cities Must Fight Educational efforts also targeted women in the form of campaigns such as \\"Grandma's Pantry\\". Supported by the National Grocer's Association, various pharmaceutical houses, and the American National Dietetic Association, \\"Grandma's Pantry\\" educated women on national guidelines for how, when properly prepared, a home could withstand a nuclear holocaust. Avoiding the scare tactics that were primarily used by other forms of civil defense education, \\"Grandma's Pantry\\" instead attempted a supposedly \\"softer\\" and so- called \\"feminine\\" approach to emergency preparedness by fusing female domesticity with paramilitary education. Through this, women were encouraged to \\"make ready for the possibility of nuclear war\\" by warning them against \\"the possibility of damaged water systems, broken sewer lines, mounting heaps of garbage, and a lack of food and fresh water after an attack\\", all of which were duties that typically aligned with prescribed gender roles given to women during the postwar era. Thus, civil defense education attempted to seemingly blend into already established societal norms. Civil defense educational efforts also included training in practical life skills lessons that they could implement in the case of nuclear war. Home economics courses in grade schools trained students on how to build and maintain fallout shelters, the basics of food preparation and storage, safety and sanitation, child care, and how to care for the sick and injured. These lessons transferred to real life expectations, where even adults were continuously instructed on how to manage homes, perform gendered assigned roles, and prepare their families for the case of nuclear attacks. Such examples were found in literature and educational films which taught women the values and skills of home nursing and first aid that would protect and save the lives of their family members. Women were also taught to be the ones to dominate kitchen work during the first few days within shelters if there was an emergency, only to be relieved by teenagers and young children who were only expected to volunteer when needed. Evacuation plans At the dawn of the nuclear age, evacuation was opposed by the federal government. The Federal Civil Defense Administration produced a short movie called Our Cities Must Fight. It argued that in the event of a nuclear war, people need to stay in cities to help repair the infrastructure and man the recovering industries. \\"Nuclear radiation,\\" it advised, \\"would only stay in the air a day or two.\\"Anthony Rizo (Director), Ray J. Mauer (Writer). (1951). \\"Our Cities Must Fight [Film].\\" Los Angeles: Archer Productions, Inc. See Free download from the Internet Archive or IMDB description Despite this early opposition, evacuation plans were soon created. One city at the forefront of such efforts was Portland, Oregon. In 1955, their city government completed \\"Operation Greenlight\\"‚Äîa drill to evacuate the city center. Hospital patients were packed into semi-trucks, pedestrians were picked up by passing motorists, and the city's construction equipment and emergency vehicles were rushed out to \\"dispersal points.\\" The entire city center was evacuated in 19 minutes.Portland Online On December 8, 1957, CBS Television aired a dramatization of how a well prepared city might respond to an imminent nuclear attack. The show, A Day Called 'X', produced \\"in co- operation with the Federal Civil Defense Administration,\\" was shot in Portland, using City officials and ordinary citizens instead of professional actors. It was narrated by Glenn Ford.Harry Rasky (Director). (1957) \\"A Day Called X [TV].\\" CBS. See NY Times Review, IMDB description, or Free Download from The Internet Archive Such plans were plausible in the early days of the Cold War, when an attack would have come from strategic bombers, which would have allowed a warning of many hours, not to mention the high possibility of interception by anti-air systems and fighters. However, the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the late 1950s made this goal less realistic. Despite that, civil defense officials still worked to prepare evacuation plans. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan announced the Crisis Relocation Program. The White House suggested that the $10 billion, five-year program could allow the evacuation of targeted urban centers to rural \\"host areas\\" and thus save 80% of the population. The plan allowed up to three days for the evacuation to be completed, believing that a nuclear war would not come in a surprise attack but rather as the culmination of a crisis period of rising tensions.See this website and Edward Zuckerman. The Day after World War III. New York: Viking Press, 1984. and Jennifer Leaning and Langley Keyes, editors. The Counterfeit ark: Crisis Relocation for Nuclear War. Cambridge, MA: Ballinger Publishing Company, 1983. . However, the plan has been criticized by academics and organizations like the Federation of American Scientists for failing to take into account disruptions to healthcare infrastructure preventing the effective treatment of the wounded, disruption to the food supply, ecological devastation (including nuclear winter), and social unrest following an attack. Because of these shortcomings, Stanford University physician and professor Herbert L. Abrams estimated that no more than 60 million people (25% of the population) would survive if the program was executed as designed. A Civil Defense patch for Cuyahoga County, Ohio Ensuring continuity of government Governments made efforts to exist even after an apocalyptic nuclear attack, something called continuity of government. Many city halls built Emergency Operation Centers in their basements. Fallout shelters President Kennedy launched an ambitious effort to install fallout shelters throughout the United States. These shelters would not protect against the blast and heat effects of nuclear weapons, but would provide some protection against the radiation effects that would last for weeks and even affect areas distant from a nuclear explosion. As such, some of them were even located on the upper floors of skyscrapers. CD officials encouraged people to build in the suburbs away from key targets and to be conscientious of the needs of a nuclear age when building houses and other structures.  CONELRAD  In order for most of these preparations to be effective, there had to be some degree of warning. The United States embarked on creating systems at both the local and national levels to allow the communication of emergencies. In 1951, President Harry S. Truman established the CONELRAD (Control of Electromagnetic Radiation) Plan. Under the system, a few primary stations would be alerted of an emergency and would broadcast an alert. All broadcast stations throughout the country would be constantly listening to an upstream station and repeat the message, thus passing it from station to station. After broadcasting the message, all radio communications would cease except for two designated lower power AM frequencies (640 and 1240 kHz). This was designed to prevent enemy planes from using transmitters as navigation aids for direction finding. The later threat of ICBMs (which used internal guidance) made this obsolete, and CONELRAD was replaced in 1963. Operation Alert and opposition to civil defense drills In 1954, the United States government began an annual national civil defense exercise called \\"Operation Alert\\". The exercise extended over several weeks to months, and would culminate in a one day public drill simulating a nuclear attack. The aim of the annual exercise was to evaluate emergency preparedness in the face of a nuclear attack, determine government continuation readiness, and identify problems that might occur during an alert. Operation Alert was actively protested by the Catholic Worker Movement, Ralph DiGia, and others in New York City when held on June 15, 1955. Protesters objected to the notion that a nuclear war was survivable, and answered with the assertion that the only way to survive a nuclear war was for one not to happen at all. 29 Individuals were arrested in City Hall Park, and jailed for refusing to take shelter during a drill. Protests, initially small and isolated, continued and grew throughout the 1950s. Opposition to the drills increased; young mothers with children joined the protests in 1960. Civil Defense Operation Alert drills were stopped after the 1961 protest.Dee Garrison: \\"Our Skirts Gave Them Courage\\" The Civil Defense Protest Movement in New York City 1955‚Äì1961., chapter 10 in Joanne J. Meyerowitz, ed., Not June Cleaver: Women and Gender in Postwar America, 1945‚Äì1960, 1994, Philadelphia, Temple University Press  Emergency Broadcast System  A Thunderbolt siren in Wisconsin.In 1963, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created the Emergency Broadcast System to replace CONELRAD. The EBS served as the primary alert system through the Cold War ICBM era and well into the 1990s. In addition to these, air raid sirens such as the Thunderbolt siren pictured to the right, would sound an alert. =Post‚ÄìCold War= Since the end of the Cold War, civil defense has fallen into disuse within the United States. Gradually, the focus on nuclear war shifted to an \\"all-hazards\\" approach of Comprehensive Emergency Management. Natural disasters and the emergence of new threats such as terrorism have caused attention to be focused away from traditional civil defense and into new forms of civil protection such as emergency management and homeland security. In 2006, the old triangle logo was finally retired, replaced with a new logo featuring a stylized EM (for emergency management).Proud Symbol of Fear Replaced By Wuss Emblem The new logo was announced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency; however, a depiction of the old CD logo (without the red CD letters) can be seen above the eagle's head in the FEMA seal. The name and logo, however, continue to be used by Hawaii State Civil Defense Hawaii State Civil Defense and Guam Homeland Security/Office of Civil Defense Guam Homeland Security  Office of Civil Defense. The Republic of the Philippines has an Office of Civil Defense that uses a similar logo. Past and present civil defense agencies After the September 11, 2001 attacks, US civil defense planning was conducted within the cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Between 1979 and 2001, the duties of civil defense were served by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Originally an independent agency, FEMA was absorbed into DHS in 2003. Before the creation of FEMA in 1979 the responsibility for civil defense in the United States was shared between a wide variety of short- lived and frequently changing departments, agencies, and organizations. Some of the notable national pre-FEMA organizations in the US included: * Council of National Defense * Office of Emergency Planning (OEP) in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) * Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in the Office of Emergency Planning * Civil Air Patrol * National Security Resources Board (NSRB), both as an independent agency and as an office within the Executive Office of the President * Office of Defense Mobilization in the Executive Office of the President * Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization in the Executive Office of the President * Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization in the Executive Office of the President * Office of Emergency Planning in the Executive Office of the President * Office of Emergency Preparedness in the Executive Office of the President * Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA), both as an independent agency and as a board within the Executive Office of the President * State defense forces of individual U.S. states * United States Coast Guard Auxiliary  See also  * American Civil Defense Association * Blast shelter * NYPD Auxiliary Police * State defense force  References   Further reading  =World War II civil defense= * Louis L.

The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas. In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Nixon became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk. Summary Nixon has a municipal airport that is classified as a small general aviation aerodrome with no amenities for passenger flight airplanes. The local economy includes a variety of farms and a single office building where Nixon Public School was stationed from the 1950s until the early 2000s. Ever since Nixon Public School was closed due to the provincial government cutbacks on education, Nixon has become a bedroom community for people who can afford to live in a single-family house. No shops or grocery stores operate in this community; which means food must be either purchased directly from a farmer or from a grocery store in Simcoe/Delhi. Private automobiles and taxis are generally found in Nixon for the purpose of commuting as Ride Norfolk mass transit services don't have a bus stop in Nixon. Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell Satellite TV or over-the-air. Five channels (CIII-DT, CITY-DT, CICO-DT, CITS- DT, and CKCO-DT) can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional five channels (WYNB-DT, CHCH-DT, CFPL-DT, WICU-DT, and CHCJ-DT) tend to not be as reliable to pick up through an outdoor antenna. There are at least 14 channels that can't be viewed on days that are cloudy, rainy, snowy, or during times of strong winds.Over-the-air TV report for Nixon, Ontario at TV Fool This community is the westernmost community to receive water from the Lynn River; which flows directly into Lake Erie. Water from the Lynn River is considered to be the purest water in Norfolk County because it isn't filtered out by the other creeks and rivers. Trees surround the hamlet of Nixon help to play a vital role in shading the community from excessive wind and heat during the summer time. However, the forest has dangers of its own like swampland, poison ivy, poison oak and the local population of rattlesnakes. A gas station was once operated just southeast of Nixon. It appeared to be run-down and operated solely as a private residence even back in the late 1980s. It was an independent gas station with the only little store owned by Mr. Bell. =New Limburg Brewing Company= The former public school was opened as a craft brewery and pub in September 2015. \\"New Limburg\\" Brewery is owned and operated by a family from the Netherlands, who brew several different Belgian-style beers. They are open daily until 11:00 P.M. for samples and sales. http://newlimburg.com/ Microbrewery Coming to Nixon at The Simcoe Reformer Norfolk County council personally had to approve the land's zoning change from educational to light industrial in order for Norfolk County's third microbrewery to be possible according to their set of by-laws.Third microbrewery coming to Norfolk County at Norfolk Farms Some of the chalkboards from the old Nixon Public School have been preserved and service is available even in the coldest winter months. The beers served at this establishment range from being of average quality to excellent quality. Most customers spend less than 60 minutes in this establishment. Drinking different types of beer is possible in a sampler and the drinks have names like The Black Sheep. Most of the patrons come in during the daytime when the roads are easily navigable. There is an outdoor patio, in addition, to live music playing throughout the establishment.New Limburg Brewing Company at Trip Advisor =Climate= Throughout the history of the hamlet, Nixon has seen temperatures as cold as and as warm as ; although summers in Nixon have typically been around in the past. March weather in Nixon was pretty much below freezing until the early-2000s when changing weather patterns replaced the March freezing rain with April-like rain. The winter of 1975 was the only unusually mild winter in the region from 1897 to 1977. From the late 1990s onwards, winters have become more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Nixon traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. As in all communities, towns and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Nixon over the decades. The warmest summers that Nixon has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Should the sea levels rise by , Nixon would not be affected by flooding. However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available freshwater and may be forced to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from the Eastern United States. Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments.

It is located at 1500 Marilla in the Government District of downtown Dallas. The current building, the city's fifth city hall, was completed in 1978 and replaced the Dallas Municipal Building. History Beaux-Arts municipal center in Downtown Dallas The City of Dallas' idea for a centralized municipal center began when city planning consultants Harland Bartholomew & Associates presented their ideas in 1944. The idea was to relocate from the current Dallas Municipal Building to a grand Beaux-Arts complex of city and federal offices, a convention center and cultural facilities. Two sites downtown were possible contenders: one north centered on Federal Street and Akard, and one south centered on Young Street. Plans proceeded until cost estimates shocked city leaders and the plan was shelved, although land at the southern site was acquired by the city for future use. The 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy turned the world against the city, as Dallas became known as the \\"City of Hate\\". Dallas Mayor Erik Jonsson made it a priority to reinvent the city's image, and the \\"Goals for Dallas\\" program was enacted to accomplish this. One of the goals, Design of the City, was summarized by the statement, \\"We demand a city of beauty and functional fitness that embraces the quality of life for all its people.\\" http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0729/building_2-1.html This was the start of the movement to create a new modern City Hall and municipal center. Planning for the Dallas Municipal Center commenced in 1964 when the Dallas City Council appointed a Citizen's City Hall Site Committee to select an appropriate location for new municipal administration offices. The mayor was closely involved with the project, and a committee of prominent citizens settled on I.M. Pei to design the new facility. Construction began on June 26, 1972 under the direction of contractor Robert E. McKee and Pei. The project was completed in three phases. The City accepted the garage parking areas in November 1974; the Park Plaza in May 1976; and the building in December 1977. The cost of design and construction of the building, the Park Plaza and the garage was over $70 million. Controversies arose over cost overruns (the original estimated cost was $42.2 million) and aesthetic issues (was the building too avant-garde?), though most problems were addressed and work moved on to completion. The first Dallas City Council meeting was held in the building's City Council Chamber on February 1, 1978, and the entire facility was formally opened and dedicated on March 12, 1978. Design > When you do a city hall, it has to convey an image of the people, and this > had to represent the people of Dallas ... The people I met - rich and poor, > powerful and not so powerful - were all very proud of their city. They felt > that Dallas was the greatest city there was, and I could not disappoint > them. - I.M. Peihttp://www.galinsky.com/buildings/dallascityhall/index.htm I.M. Pei's modernist inverted pyramid design is a result of space requirements from city government. Public areas and citizen services required much less space than offices that ran the government and overhanging the upper floors allowed them to be larger than the public spaces below. The building slopes at a 34¬∞ angle, with each of the 7 above-grade floors being 9¬Ω feet wider than the one below. This inclined fa√ßade interacts with the buildings it faces downtown and provides protection from the weather and Texas sun.http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/texas/dallas/cityhall/pei.html The foundation and basement levels are considerably wider than the apparent footprint of the structure, extending out beneath the inclined facade. The cantilevered roof is 200 feet (61 meters) wide, the ground floor is 126 feet (38.4 meters) wide, and the basement 230 feet (70.1 meters) wide.http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0729/building_2-2.html When Mayor Jonsson reacted to the apparent top-heaviness of the building's shape, 3 cylindrical pillars that appear to hold up the structure were created. These contain stairwells that had originally been concealed within the design. These pillars only provide visual support and do not bear the load of the building. Pei also persuaded the city to acquire an additional 6 acres in front of the building as a plaza and buffer zone for his grand public structure. A 1,325 car parking garage was built beneath the plaza, and the extra income helped supplement the funding of the building. A buff-colored concrete was chosen for the main building material; its color resembled local earth tones. Since concrete was both the primary structural and finish material, close attention was paid to every aspect of its mix and placement. The design of Dallas City Hall inspired the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library building located across the street - whereas the upper floors of City Hall are oriented toward Marilla Street, the upper floors of the Central Library are oriented away from Marilla (and, in a form of symmetry, away from City Hall). The building features in the Robocop movies of the 1980s, as the Headquarters of the OCP company; special effects were employed to make the building appear taller than it is.http://texaspopculture.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/robocop-visits-city- hall.htmlhttp://www.dallasfilmcommission.com/robocop-dallas-locations-then- now/ Facilities *City Hall contained 1,400 workstations when it opened in 1978. It had few floor-to-ceiling walls, using instead five-, six-, and seven- foot-high partitions to create separate offices. The absence of walls allowed employees and visitors to have window views from all areas. *The second floor of Dallas City Hall is referred to as the Great Court because of its length and the uninterrupted height to the vaulted ceiling approximately above. *The Park Plaza is two blocks long and one block wide and is bounded by Young, Ervay, Marilla and Akard streets. The Plaza includes a -diameter reflecting pool, a variable-height fountain, park benches and three distinctive -high flagpoles. The Plaza is landscaped with trees native to Texas: live oaks and red oaks. The reflective pool contains large floating sculptures designed by artist Marta Pan. *A -high by -wide, three-piece sculpture titled \\"The Dallas Piece\\" was designed by Henry Moore for the plaza and resembles vertebrae. *A state-of-the-art Conference Center that includes a 156-seat auditorium and three conference rooms was recently added to Dallas City Hall. *A tunnel and station for future rail transit was constructed in the third level basement beneath the parking garage and Marilla Street. This tunnel has remained unused but has been considered for DART's second light rail route through downtown Dallas.

Although it was a decisive action between capital ships, it has no generally accepted name. On 24 May, before the final action, Bismarcks fuel tanks were damaged and several machinery compartments, including a boiler room, were flooded in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. Her captain's intention was to reach the port of Brest for repair.Cameron, pp. 6‚Äì10. Late in the day Bismarck briefly turned on her pursuers (Prince of Wales and the heavy cruisers and ) to cover the escape of her companion, the heavy cruiser to continue further into the Atlantic. Early on 25 May the British forces lost contact with Bismarck, which headed ESE towards France while the British searched NE, presuming she was returning to Norway. Later on 25 May Admiral L√ºtjens, apparently unaware that he had lost his pursuers, broke radio silence to send a coded message to Germany. This allowed the British to triangulate the approximate position of Bismarck and aircraft were dispatched to hunt for the German battleship. She was rediscovered in the late morning of 26 May by a Catalina flying boat from No. 209 Squadron RAF and subsequently shadowed by aircraft from Force H steaming north from Gibraltar. The final action consisted of four main phases. The first phase late on the 26th consisted of air strikes by torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier , which disabled Bismarcks steering gear, jammed her rudders in a turning position and prevented her escape. The second phase was the shadowing and harassment of Bismarck during the night of 26/27 May by British destroyers, with no serious damage to any ship. The third phase on the morning of 27 May was an attack by the British battleships and supported by cruisers. After about 100 minutes of fighting, Bismarck was sunk by the combined effects of shellfire, torpedo hits and deliberate scuttling. On the British side, Rodney was lightly damaged by near-misses and by the blast effects of her own guns.Kennedy, pp. 206, 283. British warships rescued 111 survivors from BismarckOne of these survivors died of his injuries, while the remainder became prisoners of war. before being obliged to withdraw because of an apparent U-boat sighting, leaving several hundred men to their fate. The following morning, a U-boat and a German weathership rescued five more survivors. In the final phase the withdrawing British ships were attacked the next day on 28 May by aircraft of the Luftwaffe, resulting in the loss of the destroyer .  Background  Map of Operation \\"Rhein√ºbung\\" and Royal Navy operations against the battleship Bismarck Bismarcks second sea battle was made unavoidable by the decisions of the Fleet Commander (G√ºnther L√ºtjens), taken well before the encounter with Hood and Prince of Wales. Even before the breakout into the North Atlantic, L√ºtjens had decided against conducting an underway refuelling in the Greenland Sea with Weissenburg,Zetterling & Tamelander, pp. 121‚Äì122 one of the pre-positioned German tankers, before his ships entered the Denmark Strait. And when, as a result of the battle with Hood and Prince of Wales, Bismarck lost access to several thousand tons of fuel in her forecastle due to a shell hit from Prince of Wales (aft of the forecastle, in her anchor locker), L√ºtjens had to order his ships to slow down to conserve fuel. The decrease in speed made Force H‚Äôs airborne torpedo attacks inevitable, and those attacks led directly to the final encounter with the Home Fleet. Determined to avenge the sinking of the \\"Pride of the Navy\\" in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the British committed every possible unit to hunting down Bismarck. The old was detached from convoy duty southeast of Greenland and ordered to set a course to intercept Bismarck if she should attempt to raid the sea lanes off North America. Prince of Wales and the cruisers Norfolk and Suffolk were still at sea in the area and tailing the German ships. A British force, the battleship King George V, the carrier Victorious and their escorts, had set sail from Scapa Flow before the loss of the Hood. The battleship Rodney was detached from escort duties on 24 May. Five aircrew from HMS Ark Royal who were decorated for their part in the Bismarck attack, photographed in front of a Swordfish bomber During the early evening of 24 May, an attack was made by a small group of Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers of 825 Naval Air Squadron under the command of Eugene Esmonde from the aircraft carrier . One hit was scored, but caused only superficial damage to Bismarcks armoured belt. For some time, Bismarck remained under long-distance observation by the British. At about 03:00 on 25 May, she took advantage of her opponents' zig-zagging to double back on her own wake; Bismarck made a nearly 270¬∞ turn to starboard, and as a result her pursuers lost sight of the battleship, thus enabling her to head for German naval bases in France unnoticed. Contact was lost for four hours, but the Germans did not know this. For reasons that are still unclear, Admiral G√ºnther L√ºtjens transmitted a 30-minute radio message to HQ, which was intercepted, thereby giving the British time to work out roughly where he was heading. However, a plotting error made onboard King George V, now in pursuit of the Germans, incorrectly calculated Bismarcks position and caused the chase to veer too far to the north. Bismarck was therefore able to make good time on 25/26 May in her unhindered passage towards France and protective air cover and destroyer escort. By now, however, fuel was becoming a major concern to both sides. The British had a stroke of luck on 26 May. In mid-morning a Coastal Command Catalina reconnaissance aircraft from 209 Squadron RAF had flown over the Atlantic from its base on Lough Erne in Northern Ireland across the Donegal Corridor.BBC ‚Äì WW2 People's War ‚Äì World War Memories of an Ulster Childhood It was piloted by British Flying Officer Dennis Briggs and co-piloted by US Navy observer Ensign Leonard B. Smith, USNR.4 November 2009, Bismarck: British/American Cooperation and the Destruction of the German Battleship, Naval History and Heritage Command Smith was at the controls when he spotted Bismarck (via a trailing oil slick from the ship's damaged fuel tank) and reported her position to the Admiralty. From then on, the German ship's position was known to the British, although the enemy would have to be slowed significantly if heavy units hoped to engage outside the range of German land- based aircraft. All British hopes were now pinned on Force H, whose main units were the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, the battlecruiser and the light cruiser . This battle group, commanded by Admiral James Somerville, had been diverted north from Gibraltar. The battle = Night of 26/27 May = At dusk that evening, and in atrocious weather conditions, Swordfish from Ark Royal launched an attack. The first wave mistakenly targeted Sheffield which had been detached from Force H under orders to close and shadow Bismarck. Although precious time was lost by this incident, it proved beneficial to the British in that the magnetic detonators on the torpedoes used against Sheffield were seen to be defective and for the following attack on Bismarck were replaced by those designed to explode on contact. Despite the lateness of the day, it was decided to try again. The attack commenced in near darkness at around 21:00 but once again the Swordfish torpedo bombers found Bismarck with their ASV II radars.Brown, p.34 A hit by a single torpedo from a Swordfish, hitting her port side, jammed Bismarcks rudder and steering gear 12¬∞ to port. This resulted in her being, initially, able to steam only in a large circle. Repair efforts by the crew to free the rudder failed.Garzke & Dulin, p. 235 Bismarck attempted to steer by alternating the power of her three propeller shafts, which, in the prevailing force 8 wind and sea state, resulted in the ship being forced to sail towards King George V and Rodney, two British battleships that had been pursuing Bismarck from the west.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 235‚Äì236 At 23:40 on 26 May, Admiral L√ºtjens delivered to Group West, the German command base, the signal \\"Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F√ºhrer.\\"Jackson 2002, p. 91. Throughout that night, Bismarck was the target of intermittent torpedo attacks by the destroyers , , and , and the Polish destroyer . One of Bismarck‚Äôs shells sheared off Cossack‚Äôs antenna and three shells from the Bismarck straddled the HMS Zulu wounding three men. The British destroyers didn‚Äôt score any hits, but the constant worrying tactics of the British helped wear down the morale of the Germans and deepened the fatigue of an already exhausted crew. = The final action = Rodney firing on Bismarck, which can be seen burning in the distance As the British units converged on Bismarcks location, Tovey instructed the commander of Rodney to close to within as quickly as possible, and that while he should in general conform to King George Vs movements, he was free to manoeuvre independently.Garzke & Dulin 1980, p. 210 The morning of Tuesday 27 May 1941 brought a heavy grey sky, a rising sea and a tearing wind from the northwest. Because of this northwesterly gale, Tovey concluded an attack on Bismarck from windward was undesirable. He decided to approach on a northwesterly bearing before deploying.Barnett, p. 311 For her part, Bismarck was still unmanoeuvrable; her crew made what preparations they could for the inevitable engagement, including pushing her Arado floatplane overboard to reduce the risk of fire.Garzke & Dulin 1985, pp. 237‚Äì238 At 08:43, lookouts on King George V spotted Bismarck, some away; Rodney opened fire first at 08:47, followed quickly by King George V. Bismarck returned fire at 08:50 with her forward guns; with her second salvo, she straddled Rodney; this was the closest she came to scoring a hit on any British warship in the engagement.Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 288‚Äì289 At 09:02, a salvo from Rodney struck the forward superstructure, damaging the bridge and main fire control director and killing most of the senior officers. The salvo also damaged the forward main battery turrets. The aft fire control station took over direction of the aft turrets, but after three salvos was also knocked out. With the main fire control position out of action, Bismarcks shooting became increasingly erratic, allowing the British to close the range. Norfolk and Dorsetshire closed and began firing with their guns.Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 290‚Äì291Garzke & Dulin 1985, p. 239 By 09:31, all four of Bismarcks main battery turrets were out of action, allowing Rodney to close to around with impunity to fire her guns at what was point-blank range into Bismarcks superstructure. King George V remained at a greater distance to increase the possibility that her shells would strike Bismarcks decks. During this period, Rodney launched a pair of torpedoes at Bismarck, claiming one hit. The two battleships quickly reduced their German opponent to a shambles, aflame from stem to stern, though the Germans refused to surrender. The ship was settling by the stern due to uncontrolled flooding and had taken on a 20 degree list to port by 10:00. By that time, the two British battleships had fired some 700 large-caliber shells at Bismarck,Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 291‚Äì294 all told, the two battleships, Dorsetshire, and Norfolk fired some 2,800 shells, scoring around 400 hits.McGowen, p. 56 At around this time, First Officer Hans Oels, the senior surviving officer, issued the order to abandon ship. He also instructed the engine-room crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges.Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 292‚Äì294 Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship.Gaack & Carr, pp. 80‚Äì81 Meanwhile, Tovey's battleships were running low on ammunition and fuel; at 10:20, he ordered Dorsetshire to close and torpedo the crippled Bismarck while King George V and Rodney turned for port. Dorsetshire fired a pair of torpedoes into Bismarcks starboard side, one of which hit. Dorsetshire then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash. Based on subsequent examination of the wreck, the last torpedo appears to have detonated against Bismarcks port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater.Jurens et. al.Zetterling & Tamelander, p. 281 The ship began capsizing at about 10:35, and by 10:40 had slipped beneath the waves.Garzke & Dulin 1985, p. 246 =Survivors= War memorial in Neuhofen im Innkreis also commemorating Franz Kienast, who died aged 23 in the sinking of the Bismarck Dorsetshire and Maori attempted to rescue survivors, but a U-boat alarm caused them to leave the scene after having rescued only 111 Bismarck sailors, leaving the majority of Bismarcks survivors from the 2,200-man crew (around 800) to the rough Atlantic waters. The next morning, , dispatched to try to rescue Bismarck‚Äôs logbook (and which heard sinking noises from a distance), picked up three survivors in a raft (Herzog, H√∂ntzsch, and Manthey) and the German weather ship picked up two survivors in another raft (Lorenzen and Maus) before finding another raft that was empty.  Aftermath  After the sinking, Admiral John Tovey said, \\"The Bismarck had put up a most gallant fight against impossible odds worthy of the old days of the Imperial German Navy, and she went down with her colours flying.\\" The Board of the Admiralty issued a message of thanks to those involved: Unaware of the fate of the ship, Group West, the German command base, continued to issue signals to Bismarck for some hours, until Reuters reported news from Britain that the ship had been sunk. In Britain, the House of Commons was informed of the sinking early that afternoon. After the battle, the British warships returned to the United Kingdom with 111 Bismarck survivors. One died later of his wounds. After a period of interrogation and processing, the survivors spent the rest of the war as prisoners. No British ship was sunk during this action, but the destroyer was sunk by the Luftwaffe during the withdrawal the following day. Several Bismarck survivors spoke afterwards of a sailor on Dorsetshire, Midshipman Joe Brooks, who leapt into the water in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue a German sailor who had lost both his arms. In a 1989 National Geographic documentary on Bismarck, one of the survivors said, \\"the name Joe Brooks meant something to us; our government should've given that man a medal for humaneness.\\" Order of battle = Axis = * German battleship = Allied = * The British battleships and . * The British aircraft carrier * The British heavy cruisers and . * The British light cruiser . * The British destroyers , , , , , * The Polish destroyer = Neutral = * Spanish heavy cruiser (attempted to rescue some survivors from Bismarck)  See also  * Operation Rhein√ºbung, the intended mission of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen * Sink the Bismarck!, a 1960 film based on C.

(February 11, 1799 - January 20, 1873) was the French priest who founded the Congregation of Holy Cross from which three additional congregations were founded, namely the Marianites of Holy Cross, the Sisters of the Holy Cross, and the Sisters of Holy Cross. Father Moreau was beatified on September 15, 2007 in Le Mans, France. Early life Basile-Antoine Moreau was born on February 11, 1799, in Laign√©-en-Belin, a small village near Le Mans, France to Louis and Louise Pioger Moreau. His father was a wine merchant.\\"History of Father Moreau\\", Marianites of the Holy Cross He grew up in the midst of the turmoil of the French Revolution.\\"Blessed Father Basil Moreau, C.S.C.\\", The Brothers of the Holy Cross As his parents were devout Catholics involved in the underground Church, the aspect of the Revolution which most affected him was the suppression of the Church. The ninth of 14 children, Basil was accustomed to a sparse life; yet, by the generosity of his pastor who tutored him, he was able to achieve a good primary education. The priest then made arrangements for him to enter the Minor seminary at Chateau Gontier. Feeling himself called to the priesthood, Basil entered the diocesan seminary in 1812, when the hostilities of the Revolution toward the Church had subsided. The seminary was run by the Society of Saint-Sulpice and schooled him in the French school of spirituality which remained an inspiration in his preaching and writings all his life. At the age of 22, in 1821, Basil Moreau was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Le Mans at the Old Visitation Convent Chapel of the Sacred Heart, while the Cathedral of St. Julien in Le Mans was under restoration. After ordination Fr. Moreau spent two more years with the Sulpicians in Paris. Ministry Basil Moreau in a stained glass window in Stinson-Remick hall at the University of Notre Dame In 1823, he became professor of philosophy at the minor seminary of Tess√©. Then in 1825 he taught at St Vincent Seminary and later became the vice-rector and spiritual director.\\"Bl. Basil Anthony Mary Moreau (1799-1873)\\", Vatican News Service As most of the pastors and teachers in France before the Revolution were priests and religious forced into exile, by the 1820s most of the nation was ill- catechized, illiterate, and without benefit of the sacraments. Restoration of the Church was the principal theme and work of Fr. Moreau's life. As a young priest and throughout his life, Basil was an effective preacher who preached parish missions and offered the sacraments on an itinerant basis to rekindle the neglected faith in towns and villages throughout the region. In 1835, he was assigned to be the assistant superior of the seminary at Le Mans, where he was a popular and inspiring professor of theology. He founded a group of priests within the Diocese of Le Mans to assist diocesan clergy in his various endeavors to re-invigorate the Church, especially preaching parish missions. He called them the Society of Auxiliary Priests. In the same year, an older priest of the same diocese, Fr. Jacques-Francois Dujari√©, who fifteen years before, in 1820, had founded a band of young men to re-establish and teach in the schools throughout the region, handed responsibility for them over to Fr. Moreau on account of his failing health.\\"Holy Cross: Blessed Basil Moreau, C.S.C.\\", University of Portland While not technically religious because they had not made a novitiate or taken public vows, these young men were known as the Brothers of St. Joseph. Foundation of Holy Cross Following the developments of 1835 which placed in Fr. Moreau's hands all the pieces of a nascent religious community, he began to lay the groundwork for just that. In 1837, under the leadership of Fr. Moreau, the Brothers of St. Joseph and the Society of Auxiliary Priests joined by signing together the \\"Fundamental Pact of Union\\", becoming two equal societies in one community, the Congregation of Holy Cross. The congregation took its name from the neighborhood of Sainte- Croix in Le Mans, where the 12th-century church, Notre-Dame de Sainte-Croix, was to become the mother church of the new foundation. Holy Cross, following the example of its founder, would be ultramontane in its outlook, even adopting at the behest of Pope Pius IX the Roman collar and the black cape for the priest (which is identical to the pope's, but in black). Foundations of sisters There is evidence that Fr. Dujarie's dream was to found a religious community of three societies, priests, brothers, and sisters under one rule and one superior general. Fr. Moreau made good on that vision by founding in 1841 a third society within the Congregation, that of the sisters. There are three distinct congregations: the Marianites of Holy Cross (France), Sisters of the Holy Cross (United States), and Sisters of Holy Cross (Canada). Taking his inspiration from Fr. Dujarie, Moreau named the societies the Salvatorists, the Josephites and the Marianites, after the three persons of the Holy Family. To this day, though in separate congregations, the priests, brothers and sisters of Holy Cross call themselves informally the Holy Cross Family. Later life In the late 1850s, several influential members at a general chapter had him ousted as superior general over differences in what direction the congregation should take. Forced to live apart from the community, he moved in with his sisters but continued to preach retreats in the country parishes around Le Mans. Moreau died on January 20, 1873. Important dates in the life of Fr. Moreau * 1835 Taught and served as assistant superior in Le Mans; named leader of the Brothers of St. Joseph founded by Fr. Jacques Dujari√©. Founded the society of Auxiliary Priests. * 1837 United the brothers and priests into the Association of Holy Cross. * 1844 Received the vows of L√©ocadie Gascoin and three Marianites. * 1857 Received papal approval of the constitutions for the Association, which became the Congregation of Holy Cross. * 1866 Resigned as superior general, but continued an active preaching and retreat ministry. * 1873 Died on January 20 at age 73. Veneration In 1957, Basil Moreau was declared a Servant of God. On April 12, 2003, Pope John Paul II proclaimed him Venerable. Basil Moreau was beatified in Le Mans by Pope Benedict XVI on September 15, 2007, the feast day of Our Lady of Sorrows, and feast day of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Blessed Basil Moreau is commemorated on January 20. Legacy Education is Moreau's lasting legacy. Moreau Seminary, located on the University of Notre Dame campus, is the main seminary for the American congregation of the Holy Cross Fathers. Moreau is credited with playing a key role in the foundation of the University of Notre Dame as well as Saint Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana. He had a vision for unifying the two same-sex schools, but was prevented from doing so by the Vatican in Rome due to their historical beliefs that men and women should not live together. He was eventually stripped of his responsibilities for the two schools. In 1966, the Josephites (or Brothers of Holy Cross) founded the third institution of higher education in Notre Dame, Indiana to base its educational philosophy on the teachings of Basil Moreau. Holy Cross College began as a community college with the mission of helping students with the intent to transfer into one of the other two institutions. However, in 2003 Holy Cross College became a residential baccalaureate liberal arts college with its own reputation for superior teaching. St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas is a Holy Cross school and has a co-ed residential hall called Basil Moreau Hall. The University of Portland in Portland, Oregon is run by the Congregation of Holy Cross. It features the Moreau Center for Service and Leadership, which connects students to service opportunities throughout Portland and beyond.Moreau Center, University of Portland, (Oregon) Moreau Catholic High School is located in Hayward, California, about southeast of San Francisco. It is among nine Catholic high schools in the Diocese of Oakland, and it is sponsored by the South-West Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Moreau Catholic is affiliated with many other Holy Cross educational institutions worldwide, but they are the only one named after the founder of Holy Cross, Blessed Father Basil Anthony Moreau. The Holy Cross High School, New Orleans in New Orleans, Louisiana was founded by Fr. Basil Moreau. It was once called Holy Cross College, but is now known as Holy Cross School. It is located on Paris Avenue.  See also  * Julie Bertrand (Sister Marie de Saint-Basile) References External links *\\"Bl.

She achieved success after becoming a prot√©g√©e of Paul Weller. Career Born in Derby on 25 March 1965 and raised in Essex, Young was discovered by The Jam frontman, Paul Weller, through an advertisement in Smash Hits magazine for his Respond Records label. The ad solicited demo tapes from female singers between the ages of 18 and 24, for the purpose of hiring a vocalist alongside the group The Questions. Although just 17 years old, Young replied and sent Weller a cassette of a Phoebe Snow-inspired version of the Betty Wright hit \\"Shoorah Shoorah\\". Young's tape was singled out from among the hundreds received, and shortly thereafter was invited to London for an audition. Performing old soul numbers \\"Band of Gold\\" and \\"Reach Out (I'll Be There)\\" for the audition, Young impressed Weller enough to win the job and become his priority signing for the Respond label. Before recording solo work for Respond, Weller sought to increase exposure for Young. He promptly used her for backing vocals on The Jam's final single, \\"Beat Surrender\\", which was released on 26 November 1982 and became the band's fourth No. 1 single.Munn (2008), p.30. Weller also had Young join the group for their appearance on Top of the Pops to promote the song. In January 1983, Young contributed vocals for The Style Council's first single, \\"Speak Like a Child\\", and also appeared in the promotional video for the song.Munn (2008), p.32. As an unofficial member of the group, Young toured with The Style Council for part of 1983, while also performing as a solo artist as part of a Respond package tourMunn (2008), p.37. Young was featured on the cover of the 9 April 1983 issue of New Musical Express with the banner \\"Tracie: The girl star Paul Weller would build\\".Munn (2008), p.36. She was also voted \\"Most Fanciable Female\\" in Smash Hits 1983 readers' poll. Signed to Respond, she had UK hit singles in March 1983 with \\"The House That Jack Built\\" and in July with \\"Give it Some Emotion\\" (both credited simply to 'Tracie') Her debut album, Far from the Hurting Kind, was released in 1984 under the name Tracie. It was reissued in Japan in 1996. Weller produced and backed the record and wrote some of the songs. A featured track was the Elvis Costello song \\"(I Love You) When You Sleep\\", which he wrote for her. Young recorded with The Style Council again in 1985, contributing backing vocals to the song \\"Boy Who Cried Wolf\\", a single taken from the album Our Favourite Shop.Munn (2008), p.75. Respond ceased operations in 1986 and Young was briefly signed by Polydor. The second album she recorded whilst signed to Polydor, titled No Smoke Without Fire, was never released by them. It was eventually released in May 2014 by Cherry Red Records. Since the late 1990s Young has enjoyed a second career as a radio presenter, currently working at Radio Essex and also Connect FM in Peterborough and Northamptonshire. In 2009 Young did a one-off gig, supporting Billy Franks (formerly of The Faith Brothers) at The Shepherd's Bush Empire. The show was on 6 June 2009 and Tracie was backed by Southend rock band, Soliss. In the wake of the show, Young released a self-produced, limited edition six-song EP of previously released material, titled It Happened One Night...And Other Songs . In 2010, with the co-operation of Young, Cherry Red Records reissued her 1984 debut Far from the Hurting Kind, marking the first time the album has been available in the UK on CD. The 20 track CD features the 10 tracks from the original album release plus 10 bonus tracks.

Lamb 1996. Pitcher-Plants of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Borneo. It grows in highland habitats at elevations of 1700 to 2400 m above sea level.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Botanical history Nepenthes muluensis was first collected by botanist Mitsuru Hotta on March 18, 1964, on Mardi between the third and fourth camps on the western ridge of Mount Mulu, Sarawak. The holotype, M.Hotta 14791d, is deposited at the Botany Department of Kyoto University (KYO).Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes muluensis. Carnivorous Plant Database. Hotta described the species in 1966, naming it after Mount Mulu, to which it was thought to be endemic. The description did not cover the lower pitchers of this species, which were unknown at the time. Nepenthes muluensis was the first Nepenthes species to be described in 26 years (after N. densiflora in 1940)Danser, B.H. 1940. A new Nepenthes from Sumatra. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 16: 268‚Äì271. and the first since the end of World War II. At this time the genus was experiencing a revival in global interest, thanks largely to the work of Shigeo Kurata. Nepenthes muluensis has been misidentified at least once in the literature; Bertram Evelyn Smythies identified specimens of N. muluensis as belonging to N. gracillima, a species endemic to Peninsular Malaysia. This misidentification was published in 1965 in the proceedings of the UNESCO Humid Tropics Symposium, which was held in Kuching two years earlier. Description Nepenthes muluensis is a climbing plant. The stem may attain a length of 4 m and is up to 5 mm in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical in cross section and up to 8 cm long. A lower pitcher The leaves of this species are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina is lanceolate in shape and up to 8 cm long by 1.5 cm wide. It usually has an acute apex and is gradually attenuate towards the base, extending into an amplexicaul sheath. Up to 4 longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are numerous but indistinct. Tendrils are up to 8 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers are up to 7 cm high and 3 cm wide. They are ovate in the lower third, becoming cylindrical or conical above. The peristome is approximately cylindrical and up to 5 mm wide. Its inner margin is lined with small but distinct teeth. The pitcher mouth is round to ovate and has an oblique insertion. The lid or operculum is ovate and generally obtuse. It bears a number of filiform appendages (‚â§5 mm long) on its upper surface. A typical upper pitcher from Mount Murud Upper pitchers are cylindrical for the most part, often with a bulbous basal quarter. Like their lower counterparts, they are relatively small, reaching only 10 cm in height and 2 cm in width. They have a pair of ribs in place of wings. The waxy zone of the inner surface is well developed.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The pitcher mouth is round and bears a cylindrical peristome up to 3 mm wide. The lid is orbicular and lacks appendages. An unbranched spur in inserted near the base of the lid. Nepenthes muluensis has a racemose inflorescence. It is very compact: the peduncle is only up to 3 cm long, while the attenuate rachis reaches 10 cm in length. Pedicels are up to 5 mm long and lack bracts. Sepals are ovate and up to 2 mm long. A study of 120 pollen samples taken from two herbarium specimens (J.H.Adam 2401 and J.H.Adam 2405) found the mean pollen diameter to be 32.0 Œºm (SE = 0.4; CV = 8.7%).Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1999. Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science 22(1): 1‚Äì7. The species completely lacks an indumentum, with all parts of the plant being glabrous. The type population of N. muluensis from Mount Mulu has a distinctive pitcher colouration. Lower pitchers are generally dark purple with sparse yellow speckles. The upper pitchers of this form are usually purple with numerous yellowish-white speckles. They often have a white peristome and lid.Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Plants from Mount Murud produce darker-coloured pitchers.De Witte, J. 1996. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 25(2): 41‚Äì45. Ecology As its name suggests, N. muluensis was originally known only from Mount Mulu. Since its description it has also been found on several other mountains in Sarawak (including Mount Api,Bourke, G. 2011. The Nepenthes of Mulu National Park. Carniflora Australis 8(1): 20‚Äì31. Mount Murud, and Bukit Batu Lawi) and one in southwestern Sabah.Bourke, G. 2010. Captive Exotics Newsletter 1(1): 4‚Äì7. Nepenthes muluensis has not been recorded from the nearby summit of Mount Benarat, although this is a limestone peak and mostly lies outside the known altitudinal distribution of the species, which is 1700 to 2400 m above sea level.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R.

It typically occurs in open areas of mossy forest amongst ridge-top vegetation. On Mount Mulu, the species seems to be restricted to the western ridge and occurs from an elevation of around 1900 m to the summit at 2376 m. The summit vegetation is greatly stunted, rarely exceeding a metre in height. It is dominated by rhododendrons (particularly Rhododendron ericoides),Steiner, H. 2002.

Jermy 1979. The Rgs Expedition to Gunong Mulu, Sarawak 1977-78. The Geographical Journal 145(2): 175‚Äì191. Nepenthes muluensis is most abundant in summit heath forest, where it forms dense stands with hundreds of white-speckled pitchers suspended over the sympatric shrubs. On Mount Murud, N. muluensis grows in shady mossy forest. This population produces darker pitchers than the one from Mount Mulu, possibly due to greater exposure to ultraviolet light at higher altitudes. Two true toad species from Mount Murud, Pelophryne linanitensis and Pelophryne murudensis, are sympatric with N. muluensis and may breed in its pitchers.Das, I. 2008. The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology 56(2): 435‚Äì443. The conservation status of N. muluensis is listed as Least concern on the IUCN Red List based on a 2018 assessment. This differs from prior assessments made by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre: in 2000 as Vulnerable and in 1995 as Endangered.Simpson, R.B. 1995. Nepenthes and Conservation. Curtis's Botanical Magazine 12: 111‚Äì118. In 1997, Charles Clarke informally classified the species as Endangered based on the IUCN criteria, noting that it is Conservation Dependent if populations in protected areas are taken into account. Related species Nepenthes muluensis belongs to what has been called the \\"Hamata group\\", which also includes four other closely related species from Borneo and Sulawesi: N. glabrata, N. hamata, N. murudensis, and N. tentaculata.Meimberg, H. & G. Heubl 2006. Introduction of a nuclear marker for phylogenetic analysis of Nepenthaceae. Plant Biology 8(6): 831‚Äì840. More recently, N. nigra has joined this group of related taxa.Nerz, J., A. Wistuba, C.C. Lee, G. Bourke, U. Zimmermann & S. McPherson 2011. Nepenthes nigra, a new pitcher plant from Central Sulawesi. In: McPherson, S.R. New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 468‚Äì491. Nepenthes muluensis is most easily confused with N. tentaculata. The lower pitchers of these species are almost identical, but those of N. muluensis have a rounder mouth. The climbing stem, growth habit and leaves are also similar, although N. muluensis usually has a narrower lamina. However, the upper pitchers of N. muluensis are distinctive; they usually have a white lid, a round mouth, and their wings are either greatly reduced or absent altogether.

Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. =Nepenthes √ó sarawakensis= Nepenthes muluensis √ó N. tentaculata was described as N. √ó sarawakiensis in 1993 by J. H. Adam, C. C. Wilcock, and M. D. Swaine.Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1993. One New Natural Hybrid of Nepenthes from Mt. Mulu. The Sarawak Museum Journal 43: 291‚Äì294. The authors distinguished the taxon from N. muluensis on the basis of its branched spur and the presence of fringe hairs on the top of the lid. They also compared the distribution of phenolic compounds in the leaves of N. muluensis and the hybrid, although they did so without specifying the number of plants studied or the number of repetitions performed. As a result, doubts have been raised over the existence of this hybrid.Phillipps, A., A. Lamb & C.C. Lee 2008. Pitcher Plants of Borneo. Second Edition. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Charles Clarke writes that the authors described N. √ó sarawakiensis \\"in such a way that their work cannot be easily repeated\\". Although this natural hybrid is likely to exist, it is possible that N. √ó sarawakiensis was described based on specimens of N. muluensis with lower pitchers. { cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"float: left; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; width: 400px; border: 1px #bbbbbb solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 85%;\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=limegreen  colspan=\\"10\\"  Distribution of phenolic compounds and leucoanthocyanins in N. muluensis, N. tentaculata, and N. √ó sarawakiensis - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=lightgreen  Taxon 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  Specimen - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. muluensis- + ++ +  + -3+-Jumaat 2400 - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. tentaculata + +-¬±- + --Jumaat 2392 - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. √ó sarawakiensis++++++3+- - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. √ó sarawakiensis (in vitro)++++++++- - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=lightgreen  colspan=\\"10\\"  Key: 1: Phenolic acid, 2: Ellagic acid, 3: Quercetin, 4: Kaempferol, 5: Luteolin, 6: 'Unknown Flavonoid 1', 7: 'Unknown Flavonoid 3', 8: Cyanidin ¬±: very weak spot, +: weak spot, ++: strong spot, 3+: very strong spot, -: absent } In 2002, phytochemical screening and analytical chromatography were used to study the presence of phenolic compounds and leucoanthocyanins in N. √ó sarawakiensis and its putative parent species. The research was based on leaf material from dry herbarium specimens. Eight spots containing phenolic acids, flavonols, flavones, leucoanthocyanins and 'unknown flavonoids' 1 and 3 were identified from chromatographic profiles. The distributions of these in N. √ó sarawakiensis, N. muluensis and N. tentaculata are shown in the adjacent table. A specimen of N. √ó sarawakiensis grown from tissue culture (in vitro) was also tested. Phenolic acid, 'Unknown Flavonoid 1' and cyanidin were undetected in N. muluensis, while N. tentaculata lacked quercetin, luteolin, 'Unknown Flavonoid 3', and cyanidin. Chromatographic patterns of the N. √ó sarawakiensis samples studied showed complementation of its putative parental species. Myricetin was found to be absent from all studied taxa. This agrees with the findings of previous authorsJay, M. & P. Lebreton 1972. Chemotaxonomic research on vascular plants.

In 2019, its annual revenues were $11.37 billion. Company history Alan B. Miller, who currently serves as the company‚Äôs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, founded Universal Health Services, Inc. in 1979. Within 18 months of its founding, UHS owned four hospitals and had management contracts with two additional hospitals. In 1979, UHS entered Las Vegas with the purchase of Valley Hospital. In 1980, the company chose its first Board of Directors. In 1981, UHS held its initial public offering. In 1982, UHS purchased five hospitals from the Stewards Foundation, marking the first time a for-profit corporation purchased hospitals from a nonprofit religious organization. In 1983, UHS purchased Qualicare, Inc. for more than $116 million. The purchase included 11 acute care hospitals and four behavioral health hospitals. In 1986, UHS created Universal Health Realty Income Trust, the first REIT in the healthcare industry. 1991, UHS stock trading moved from NASDAQ to NYSE. In 1997, UHS acquired an 80% stake in George Washington University Hospital. In 1999, Debra K. Osteen was appointed vice president of UHS and president of the Behavioral Health Division. In 2003, Steve Filton was named UHS's Chief Operating Officer. In 2007, UHS formed UHS Development Company, Inc. to build hospitals. Richard C. Wright was named president of UHS Development Company. In November 2010, UHS reached an agreement in May to acquire Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. for $3,1 billion. In June 2012, UHS announced its plans to acquire Ascend Health Corporation for $517 million. In February 2014, UHS bought Palo Verde Mental Health for an undisclosed amount, renaming the facility to Palo Verde Behavioral Health. In April of that year, UHS announced the acquisition of the Psychiatric Institute of Washington. In September of that year, UHS' stock joined the S&P; 500 Index and acquired Cygnet Health Care Limited for approximately $335 million. In August 2015, UHS acquired Alpha Hospitals Holdings Limited for $148 million from private equity group C&C; Alpha Group. In September of that year, UHS announced the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network based in Brentwood, Tennessee for $350 million. In August 2016, UHS bought Desert View Hospital in Pahrump, Nevada for an undisclosed amount. In December of that year, UHS acquired Cambian Group PLC's Adult Services Division. In July 2018, UHS announced its acquisition of the Danshell Group. On 28 September 2020, Universal Health Services Inc. announced that its network went offline after an unspecified \\"IT security issue\\".The company did no respond to any email inquiries regarding the incident. Controversies =Hospital licenses= The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) threatened the Rancho Springs Medical Center (Murrieta) and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center (Wildomar) in California with decertification in June 2010 while the State of California warned of a possible hospital license revocation. Universal Health Services implemented a program to address all concerns and in November 2011, the two hospitals passed a CMS Certification Survey. As a result, CMS rescinded its termination notice and the California Department of Public Health withdrew its license revocation notice. =Allegations of noncompliance with same-sex visitation law= According to a petition started on change.org by Terri-Ann Simonelli of Henderson, Nevada, Spring Valley Hospital (owned and operated by UHS) claimed that their policy required power of attorney for a same-sex partner to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. If true, this would seemingly violate new Department of Health and Human Services rules enabling same-sex partners to make said decisions, with or without power of attorney. =Fraudulent Medicaid claims= In September 2012, UHS and its subsidiaries, Keystone Education and Youth Services LLC and Keystone Marion LLC d/b/a Keystone Marion Youth Center agreed to pay over $6.9 million to resolve allegations that they submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicaid. Between October 2004 and March 2010, the entities allegedly provided substandard psychiatric counseling and treatment to adolescents in violation of the Medicaid requirements. The United States alleged that UHS falsely represented Keystone Marion Youth Center as a residential treatment facility providing inpatient psychiatric services to Medicaid enrolled children, when in fact it was a juvenile detention facility. The United States further alleged that neither a medical director nor licensed psychiatrist provided the required direction for psychiatric services or for the development of initial or continuing treatment plans. The settlement further resolved allegations that the entities filed false records or statements to Medicaid when they filed treatment plans that falsely represented the level of services that would be provided to the patients. On July 10, 2020, the US Department of Justice announced a $122 Fraudulent Claims case with \\"Universal Health Services, Inc., UHS of Delaware, Inc.(together, UHS), and Turning Point Care Center, LLC (Turning Point), a UHS facility located in Moultrie, Georgia, have agreed to pay a combined total of $122 million to resolve alleged violations of the False Claims Act for billing for medically unnecessary inpatient behavioral health services, failing to provide adequate and appropriate services, and paying illegal inducements to federal healthcare beneficiaries.\\" From the announcement: \\"The government alleged that, between January 2006, and December 2018, UHS‚Äôs facilities admitted federal healthcare beneficiaries who were not eligible for inpatient or residential treatment because their conditions did not require that level of care, while also failing to properly discharge appropriately admitted beneficiaries when they no longer required inpatient care. The government further alleged that UHS‚Äôs facilities billed for services not rendered, billed for improper and excessive lengths of stay, failed to provide adequate staffing, training, and/or supervision of staff, and improperly used physical and chemical restraints and seclusion. In addition, UHS‚Äôs facilities allegedly failed to develop and/or update individual assessments and treatment plans for patients, failed to provide adequate discharge planning, and failed to provide required individual and group therapy services in accordance with federal and state regulations. Of the $117 million to be paid by UHS to resolve these claims, the federal government will receive a total of $88,124,761.27, and a total of $28,875,238.73 will be returned to individual states, which jointly fund state Medicaid programs.\\" =Buzzfeed investigation= On December 7, 2016, Buzzfeed published a report detailing questionable practices within UHS psychiatric facilities. The report includes allegations of holding nonthreatening patients against their will, manipulative misinterpretation of patient testimonies to fit guidelines to involuntary confinement, aggressive staff layoffs and understaffing in hospitals, needless patient deaths due to understaffing and misprescription of medication, \\"violating a patient‚Äôs right to be discharged or holding a patient without the proper documentation\\", and unnecessary extension of stay times to the maximum Medicare payout. UHS denied the conclusions of the report; its stock fell approximately 12% after publication. According to the Buzzfeed investigative reporter, UHS responded to the report by hiring \\"a global PR firm that offers specialized crisis management services...UHS didn‚Äôt just implement a crisis PR plan. It also fired an employee that the company believed to have spoken to a reporter; it sued a former employee it alleges leaked damaging internal surveillance videos; it threatened to sue other employees; at least one facility held a series of town hall meetings to warn employees from speaking with us; it conducted ‚Äúin-depth interviews‚Äù with nearly two dozen staff, then distributed a public apology that two of them signed; it enlisted one of the most powerful law firms in the United States; it built multiple, high-production-value websites specifically designed to overcome the reputational damage that our reporting might cause.\\" =Cygnet Healthcare= A UK subsidiary, Cygnet Health Care, was the subject of a BBC investigation that found that staff had been taunting, provoking and scaring vulnerable people. It runs 140 mental health services across the UK. 85% of its services are ‚Äúrated good or outstanding by our regulators‚Äù. New admissions were banned at Cygnet Acer clinic after the Care Quality Commission found it unsafe to use. A patient hanged herself, others self harmed, ligature points were found where patients could hang themselves and too many of the staff were untrained to deal with the highly vulnerable patients at the clinic.New inpatients banned at mental health unit rated unsafe The Guardian The company bought four inpatient units which were previously operated by the Danshell Group in 2018. All four were condemned by the Care Quality Commission which raised concerns about patients‚Äô ‚Äúunexplained injuries‚Äù and high levels of restraint in 2019.

Description This is a fairly small species of frog, up to about 30 mm. It is variable, but is generally brown (dark to reddish) or grey and can have spots or blotches of another colour, at times this species can be completely dark brown or black, with no variation in colour throughout the dorsal surface. The dorsal surface can be bumpy or smooth. There is often a reddish stripe present from the nostril down the side. The ventral surface is mostly white, however it has some red and dark blotches as well as red in the thighs. Ecology and behaviour This species of frog is only found in Tasmania. It inhabits shallow streams, temporary ponds and puddles, dams, swamps and soaks, mostly at higher altitudes throughout most of the state. It is frequently encountered in the west of the state. It can be found in rainforest, cleared, woodland and alpine habitats. Males make a lamb-like call, ', from land beside water or while floating in water, mainly in spring and summer. Up to 100 eggs are laid in still water all year round. The eggs have rather large capsules, about . Tadpoles are brown-grey and reach in length. Development takes about 3 months and metamorph are about and resemble the adult. This is one of only three species of frogs endemic to Tasmania.

The hamlet is popular with persons from Southwestern Ontario who rent cottages and fish for pleasure during the summer months (Victoria Day through mid-October). Many of the residents live here year-round. Most of the people here drive to Port Dover or Simcoe to purchase groceries and other goods, although there was a historic general store until September 2004, when it burned down. Handmade soap and bath shop and folk art shop still exist in the community. This community lies at the mouth of Young's Creek (popular with trout fishermen) and empties into Long Point Bay. Nearby is Hay Creek Conservation Area, that can be used year-round and is suitable for hiking, walking, cycling cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. History The hamlet was founded by Lieut-Colonel Samuel Ryerse, brother of Colonel Joseph Ryerson and uncle of Egerton Ryerson.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41309837 Its harbor was important for shipping cargo from Norfolk County across the lake;http://www.nornet.on.ca/~jcardiff/transcipts/bios- photos/essays/glorious.html although its importance declined significantly sometime around the 1880s due to the advent of the railroad.Port Ryerse recognized as a historic village at Simcoe Reformer Samuel Ryerse was a United Empire Loyalist who fought with the British during the American Revolution and came to Upper Canada in 1794 where he received 3000 acres of land. He built a grist mill at the mouth of Young's Creek and a settlement grew up around it. Ryerse remained involved with the military as Lieutenant of the County of Norfolk and was also the chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions.http://www.waynecook.com/ahaldimand-norfolk.html The mill was burned by American troops in 1814 during the War of 1812. In later years, two new gristmills were built at the same location but both burned down (in 1860 and in 1890). A brick schoolhouse was built in 1871. Port Ryerse is also the birthplace of John Edward Brownlee, who was the Premier of the province of Alberta during the Roaring Twenties and through the early years of the Great Depression. John Brownlee had one sister, Maude, born September 12, 1888.Foster (1981) 4 The Brownlees lived in the general store building, and it was here that John spent the happiest times of his childhood: he much preferred his parents' books, their political discussions with neighbours, and the details of their business to life outside the store.Foster (1981) 3‚Äì4 One anecdote has the village children, displeased with his serious temperament, throwing him into Lake Erie.Foster (1981) 3 By the age of seven, John was assisting at the store with such tasks as mixing butter from the different dairies with which his father dealt to produce a standardized blend. A public elementary school called Port Ryerse School was located here that was in operation from the 19th century to the 1950s. Both Caucasian and African- Canadian students were photographed attending the school in the year 1898. The teacher shown in the 1898 school photograph was Miss A. Exelby and the picture was taken on September 14, 1898. At least 194 different species of bird have been discovered here between 1875 and 2019; including the Passenger pigeon, the Indigo hunting, and the Northern cardinal. In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Port Ryerse became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk. = Cemetery = The Memorial Anglican Church Cemetery is located in the hamlet; with at least 26 individuals or families buried here. There are various traditional British surnames like Fletcher, Lawrence, Ryerse, Sells, and Stalker among those buried at this cemetery. The most recent burial in the Memorial Anglican Church Cemetery happens to be of Miss Sarah Fletcher (who died in 1880). Lieut-Colonel Samuel Vanderhoff Ryerse Sr. was the oldest known male to be buried in this cemetery (died in 1812) while the oldest known female to be buried at this cemetery is Sarah Ryerse (n√©e Underhill; died in 1838 in her 81st year). Climate From the late 1990s onwards, winters have become more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Port Ryerse traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Port Ryerse throughout the decades. Should the sea levels rise by , Port Ryerse would not be affected by flooding. However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available fresh water and may be forced to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from the Eastern United States. Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments.

The lake is formed by San Antonio Dam on the San Antonio River. The dam is 202 feet (62 m) tall and was completed in 1965 under Monterey County District Engineer Loran Bunte Jr . The lake and dam are owned by the Monterey County Water Authority. The lake has a capacity of . Lake San Antonio's primary purpose is to provide groundwater. Without the lake, the San Antonio River would be nearly dry in the summer months. With water in the river year-round, more of it can seep into the ground. Most of the lake has dried in recent years. The 2014 Wildflower Triathlon had to accommodate the extremely low water level by moving the swim portion two miles from where it is traditionally held. Participants that year had to run along the former lake bed to get to their bike transition area. In June 2015, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors announced it would close the camping and other facilities at Lake San Antonio effective 1 July 2015, due to costs and falling attendance.http://www.ksbw.com/news/monterey-county-closing-lake-san-antonio- because-of-drought/33426734 \\"Monterey County closing Lake San Antonio because of drought\\" Area activities Boating, waterskiing, fishing and camping are popular recreational activities at the lake, particularly in the summer. Visitors can bring their own boats or rent them at the lake. Horseback riding and mountain biking are also popular; the south shore of Lake San Antonio has 26 miles of trails. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lake San Antonio based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in fish caught from this water body. Camping Lake San Antonio has over 500 campsites. Many campsites have RV hookups. Sites are available both directly on the north shore and on the south shore of the lake, as well as in the more forested areas a short walk away.SeeMonterey: Lake San Antonio Recreation Area The North Shore of Lake San Antonio is unique, as it is one of the few lakes in California that permits shoreline camping on the water's edge. Because of this, it has grown in popularity with boaters, who are allowed to keep their vessel in the water by their campsite. There is ample shoreline camping at North Shore. Most campers prefer North Shore over Lake Nacimiento (Located 9 miles south) because of the much larger campsites, and ability to camp on the water's edge. Wildlife Deer frequent the campsites, even lounging around near campsites during daylight hours. Other wildlife that may be spotted include mountain lions, snakes, wild pigs, racoons, bobcats, and badgers. Eagles frequent the lake and tours are offered during select months. =Bald eagles= Lake San Antonio is a popular winter habitat for the bald eagle, the national symbol of the United States. Monterey County Parks provides tours in January and February for visitors interested in viewing the bald eagle in its native habitat. Tours must be reserved in advance, as they often sell out weeks before they take place.Monterey County Parks: Eagle Watch Tours 2008-2009 Wildflower Triathlon Lake San Antonio is the site of the annual Wildflower Triathlon, one of the largest triathlon events in the world. The \\"Long Course\\", a half- Ironman, is considered to be especially grueling. Falling Lake Levels and Closure Beginning in summer 2013, the water level at Lake San Antonio fell dramatically. The initial drop occurred during emergency repairs on the Lake Nacimiento Dam - Lake San Antonio water was used to sustain the flow of the river below the dam.\\"Drought means lower lake levels, more crowded shores\\" The problem was exacerbated by the ongoing drought in the region. With lake facilities such as the boat ramp no longer usable, attendance fell sharply (from over 250,000 visitors per year to under 100,000 in 2014). Due to lower revenues and high costs to maintain the facilities, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors opted to close the lake effective 1 July 2015 for the remainder of the summer season. Starting in October 2017, the south shore resort area was to open only on weekends, and the north shore area was to be closed, until Memorial Day weekend 2018 See also *List of dams and reservoirs in California *List of lakes in California *List of largest reservoirs of California References External links *Lake San Antonio official information from Monterey County Parks *Cal Dept of Water:Lake San Antonio monthly water level San Antonio, Lake San Antonio, Lake Category:Campgrounds in California Category:Parks in Monterey County, California Category:Salinas River (California) Category:Santa Lucia Range San Antonio, Lake San Antonio ","title":"Lake San Antonio"},{"id":"4831394","text":"or is an island in Skjerv√∏y Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.

Because it is calorically dense and cheap to produce, fishmeal has played a critical role in the growth of factory farms and the number of farm animals it is possible to breed and feed. Fishmeal is made from the bones and offal left over from fish caught by commercial fisheries. The vast majority of the fish from which fishmeal is manufactured are not used for human consumption; rather, fishmeal is generally manufactured from by-catch.R. D. Miles and F. A. Chapman. FA122: The Benefits of Fish Meal in Aquaculture Diets Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences Department, UF/IFAS Extension. Original publication date November 2005. Reviewed January 2015. Fishmeal takes the form of powder or cake. This form is obtained by drying the fish or fish trimmings, and then grinding it. If the fish used is a fatty fish it is first pressed to extract most of the fish oil.M. L. Windsor for the UK Department of Trade and Industry, Torry Research Station. Fish meal. Torry Advisory Note No. 49 Published by FAO in partnership with Support unit for International Fisheries and Aquatic Research, SIFAR, 2001) Bibliographical information from FAO index page The production and large-scale use of fishmeal are controversial. The lucrative market for fishmeal as a feed encourages corporate fisheries not to limit their yields of by-catch (from which fish meal is made), and thus leads to depletion of ecosystems, environmental damage, and the collapse of local fisheries. And its role in facilitating the breeding and over-feeding of millions of pigs and chickens on factory farms is criticized by animal rights and animal welfare groups. Manufacturers of fishmeal counter that fishmeal's role in the feeding and breeding of millions of farm animals leads to the production of more food and the feeding of millions of people around the world. History Fish byproducts have been used historically to feed poultry, pigs, and other farmed fish. A primitive form of fishmeal is mentioned in The Travels of Marco Polo at the beginning of the 14th century: \\"they accustom their cattle, cows, sheep, camels, and horses to feed upon dried fish, which being regularly served to them, they eat without any sign of dislike.\\" The use of herring as an industrial raw material started as early as about 800 AD in Norway; a very primitive process of pressing the oil out of herring by means of wooden boards and stones was employed. Use Prior to 1910, fish meal was primarily used as fertilizer, at least in the UK. Fish meal is primarily used as a protein supplement in compound feed. As of 2010, about 56% of fish meal was used to feed farmed fish, about 20% was used in pig feed, about 12% in poultry feed, and about 12% in other uses, which included fertilizer. The cost of 65% protein fishmeal has varied between around $385 to $554 per ton since 2000, which is about two to three times the price of soybean meal. The rising demand for fish, as people in the developed world turn away from red meat and toward other sources of meat protein, has increased demand for farmed fish, with farmed fish accounting for half the fish consumed worldwide as of 2016. Demand for fish meal has increased accordingly, but harvests are regulated and supply cannot expand. This has led to a trend towards use of other ingredients such as soybean meal, cottonseed meal, leftovers from processing from corn and wheat, legumes, and algae, and an increase in research to find alternatives to fish meal and alternate strategic uses (for instance, in the growth phase, after newborn fish are established).Fry JP, et al.

The fish caught for fishmeal purposes solely are termed \\"industrial\\". Other sources of fishmeal are from bycatch and byproducts of trimmings made during processing (fish waste or offal) of various seafood products destined for direct human consumption. The main fish sources by country are:Tim Cashion from Sea Around Us.

Environmental impact Fish meal production is a significant contributor of over-fishing, and risks pushing fisheries beyond their replacement rate. Some areas of the world, such as Western Africa, have seen a large increase in fish meal production which in turn is hurting local fisheries and driving fisheries into collapse.https://greenworldwarriors.com/2019/02/11/how-pigs-in-china-are- killing-people-in-africa Processing Fish meal factory, Bressay, Shetland Islands Fish meal factory, Westfield, West Lothian Fishmeal is made by cooking, pressing, drying, and grinding of fish or fish waste into a solid. Most of the water and some or all of the oil is removed. Four or five tonnes of fish are needed to manufacture one tonne of dry fishmeal. Of the several ways of making fishmeal from raw fish, the simplest is to let the fish dry out in the sun before grinding and pressing. This method is still used in some parts of the world where processing plants are not available, but the end product is poor quality in comparison with ones made by modern methods. Today, all industrial fish meal is made by the following processes: Cooking: The fish are moved through a commercial cooker ‚Äî a long, steam-jacketed cylinder ‚Äî by a screw conveyor. This is a critical stage in preparing the fishmeal, as incomplete cooking means the liquid from the fish cannot be pressed out satisfactorily and overcooking makes the material too soft for pressing. No drying occurs in the cooking stage. Pressing: The cooked fish is compressed inside a perforated tube, expelling some of its liquids, leaving \\"press cake\\". Water content is reduced from 70% to about 50% and oil down to 4%. Drying: The press cake is dried by tumbling inside a heated drum. Under-drying may result in the growth of molds or bacteria; over-drying can cause scorching and reduction in the meal's nutritional value. Two alternative methods of drying are used: * Direct: Very hot air at a temperature of 500 ¬∞C (932 ¬∞F) is passed over the material as it is tumbled rapidly in a cylindrical drum. While quicker, heat damage is much more likely if the process is not carefully controlled. * Indirect: The meal is tumbled inside a cylinder containing steam-heated discs. Grinding: The dried meal is ground to remove any lumps or bone particles. Nutrient composition Any complete diet must contain some protein, but the nutritional value of the protein relates directly to its amino acid composition and digestibility. High-quality fishmeal normally contains between 60% and 72% crude protein by weight. Typical diets for fish may contain from 32% to 45% total protein by weight. Risks Unmodified fish meal can spontaneously combust from heat generated by oxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the meal. In the past, factory ships have sunk because of such fires. That danger has been eliminated by adding antioxidants to the meal. As of 2001, ethoxyquin was the most commonly used antioxidant, usually in the range 200‚Äì1000 mg/kg. There has been some speculation that ethoxyquin in pet foods might be responsible for multiple health problems. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only found a verifiable connection between ethoxyquin and buildup of protoporphyrin IX in the liver, as well as elevations in liver-related enzymes in some animals, but with no known health consequences from these effects. In 1997, the Center for Veterinary Medicine asked pet food manufacturers to voluntarily limit ethoxyquin levels to 75 ppm until further evidence is reported. However, most pet foods that contain ethoxyquin have never exceeded this amount. Ethoxyquin has been shown to be slightly toxic to fish. Though it has been approved for use in foods in the US, and as a spray insecticide for fruits, ethoxyquin has not been thoroughly tested for its carcinogenic potential. Ethoxyquin has long been suggested to be a possible carcinogen, and a very closely related chemical, 1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline, has been shown to have carcinogenic activity in rats, and a potential for carcinogenic effect to fishmeal prior to storage or transportation.

The bank was founded in 1847 and by 2008 the bank had assets of $63.5 billion and over 250 branches. After the acquisition, Bank of Montreal combined the Marshall & Ilsley Corporation operations into its existing U.S. subsidiary Harris Bank. History In 1847, Samuel Marshall, a Pennsylvania native, founded an exchange brokerage in a downtown Milwaukee cobbler's shop. Although Wisconsin did not allow state-chartered banks at the time, Marshall's company provided a number of traditional banking services, such as deposits and loans. In 1849, he took on Maine native Charles Ilsley as a partner, and the company took the Marshall & Ilsley name a year later. When Wisconsin finally allowed state- chartered banking in 1852, M&I; took out the first such charter, for a bank in Madison.Company history For most of its first century, the bank had a reputation for conservatism. This approach actually worked to M&I;'s advantage during major financial crises such as the Panic of 1893 and the stock market crash of 1929; it was one of the few major banks in Wisconsin to survive the latter. However, after selling the Madison bank in the late 19th century, it did business solely in Milwaukee for over six decades. The first real expansion came in 1958, when M&I; reorganized as the leading subsidiary of the Bank Stock Corporation of Milwaukee after over a century as a partnership. The new company bought two of its competitors, Northern Bank and Bank of Commerce. The three banks retained their own names and headquarters within a single corporate structure. When regulators forced the sell-off of Bank of Commerce in 1969, they allowed Bank Stock Corporation to buy other banks in areas where there were no competing banks, and could also build branches within a three- mile radius of Milwaukee. Accordingly, Bank Stock changed its name to Marshall & Ilsley Corporation in 1971. In 1986, Marshall & Ilsley expanded outside of Wisconsin by acquiring Arizona-based Thunderbird Bank. In 1987, Marshall & Ilsley attempted a hostile takeover of the Milwaukee-based Marine Corporation, the parent of Marine Bank. Marine turned down M&I; overtures and chose Banc One Corporation's offer instead. On September 20, 1993, M&I; announced a merger with Wisconsin-based Valley Bancorporation, converting Valley stock to M&I; in a stock transaction valued at $875 million. The merger converted 155 Valley Bank locations to M&I.; 154 of these were in Wisconsin, and one in Illinois. At the time of the merger, Valley Bancorporation had more bank locations than M&I; did. Marshall & Ilsley footprint. In December 2006, M&I; signed a definitive agreement to acquire United Heritage Bankshares of Florida with 13 locations in the Orlando area. In 2007, Metavante Corporation, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary known as Marshall and Ilsley Data Services, was spun off into a separate publicly traded company and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On January 2, 2008, M&I; announced it had completed the acquisition of First Indiana (), which had 32 locations in central Indiana, for about $529 million. In late summer of 2010, M&I; Bank additionally completed the acquisition of Southwest Bank, St Louis. In mid- August 2009 the bank was named as one of the largest of more than 150 U.S. lenders that owned nonperforming loans, which made up more than 5 percent‚Äîa threshold beyond which a bank's equity can be wiped, according to regulators. =Acquisition and BMO Harris Bank= On December 17, 2010, Bank of Montreal (BMO) agreed to purchase Marshall & Ilsley in an all-stock transaction valued at about $4.1 billion. Marshall & Ilsley was combined with BMO's Harris Bank subsidiary based in Chicago, Illinois, on October 9, 2012, to form BMO Harris Bank. By this time, M&I;'s footprint comprised: *194 offices throughout the state of Wisconsin *45 locations throughout Arizona *17 offices in Kansas City and nearby communities *17 offices on Florida's west coast *26 offices in metropolitan Minneapolis/St. Paul (Twin Cities), and one in Duluth, Minnesota *1 office in Las Vegas, Nevada *16 offices in the greater St. Louis area *32 offices in the greater Indianapolis area On April 5, 2011, bank officers from M&I; Bank, Harris Bank, and the Bank of Montreal announced the name of the bank after the merger will be \\"BMO Harris Bank\\". Both M&I; Bank and Harris bank will be affected by the name change. The new logo will be similar to BMO's logo. The difference is the words \\"Bank of Montreal\\" will be replaced with \\"Harris Bank\\". The name change to \\"BMO Harris Bank\\" took place over a span of 18 months, completing on October 9, 2012. On July 5, 2011, BMO Financial Group acquired Marshall & Ilsley Corporation through its subsidiary BMO Financial Corp. (formerly Harris Financial Corp). At the time of the acquisition, certain bank mergers also occurred. M&I; Marshall & Ilsley Bank, M&I; Bank N.A. (successor to M&I; Bank FSB), and The Harris Bank N.A. merged into Harris N.A. At the time of these mergers, Harris National Association changed its name to BMO Harris Bank National Association.

Rickford earned his B.A. in Sociolinguistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz (1968-1971) on a Fulbright undergraduate scholarship. Rickford continued his education at the University of Pennsylvania where he earned his MA in Linguistics (1971-1973) and later his Ph.D in Linguistics in 1979. = Professional career = Before working at Stanford University, Rickford held lectures in Linguistics at University of Guyana and was named Assistant Dean, Faculty of Arts, between 1979-1980. He later started teaching at Stanford University in 1980 as Visiting Assistant Linguistics Professor before being named Associate Professor, with tenure, in Linguistics (1986). While working in the United States, Rickford kept engaging with the University of Guyana as external examiner for Linguistics courses, MA and PhD theses (1982‚Äìpresent).  Field of Expertise  Rickford's research in Sociolinguistic focuses on the relation between language variation and ethnicity, social class, variation and change. He is especially interested in the varieties of English spoken by marginalized communities in relation to ethical and economical characteristics. His research focuses on African American Vernacular English (AAVE) or Ebonics, spoken by many African Americans and the role linguistics plays in the educational context. Through his work, Rickford aims to close linguistic gaps across cultures. His expertise is African American Vernacular English, which garnered national attention in the U.S. when the Oakland, California school board recognized the variety as an official dialect of English and educated teachers in its use. Rickford argues that AAVE is systematic and rule governed like all natural speech. Rickford has researched and written extensively on the topic and was an outspoken supporter of the decision. Rickford also engages in research regarding pidgin and creole languages. Most of Rickford's data comes from English-based creoles of the Caribbean. Especially, Guyanese Creole, Jamaican and Barbadian and American English. He is the author, co-author and or editor of 117 academic scholarly articles and 16 books between since his first publication in 1974. = Memberships in professional societies = * Member: American Anthropological Association, American Dialect Society, International Sociolinguistics Association, Linguistic Society of America et al. * Executive Committee Member: Linguistic Society of America [LSA], et al. * Vice- President, President and Immediate Past President: Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, Society for Caribbean Linguistics, Linguistic Society of America et al. * President of the Society for Caribbean Linguistics (2008) * President of the Linguistic Society of America (2015-2016) * Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2017).

The track was licensed by Universal Music for a full worldwide release[5], where it then reached number 10 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart.[6] His 2007 single, \\"Carry Me Away\\" (featuring Emma Hewitt), topped the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay Chart.[7] In 2012, Lake received his first Grammy nomination for collaborating with deadmau5 on the album 4x4=12. He scored his third consecutive top ten hit on the US dance chart with \\"Only One\\". \\"If You Knew\\" featuring Nastala, became his 4th consecutive top 10 single on the US dance chart. In this time he also ran two record labels called Rising Music and Rising Trax, which took hiatus in 2014. 2015 saw a major direction change, Chris released 5 tracks on Ultra Records. The first was a single \\"Chest\\"; which NestHQ hailed as \\"best described by what it isn't. It's not a frilly banger, it's not an esoteric deep cut. There's no sing-a-long happening here. Rather, Chris Lake has simplified his production to let all of the necessary elements shine\\". Following this was \\"Piano Hand\\", a collaboration with Chris Lorenzo, which was premiered on Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show and on Billboard. Two months after, Lake's collaboration with Anna Lunoe, \\"Stomper\\" was released and premiered on YourEDM, where it was acknowledged as \\"a charging house tune that received play throughout the entire festival circuit\\". During September, \\"Stranger\\" was released and got played at nearly every major festival throughout the US, according to 1001tracklists. Coinciding with this September release was a 3-month North American tour where he played at a handful of notable festivals and venues such as Hard Day of the Dead, Foundation Nightclub, and U Street Music Hall. His last release of 2015 was another collaboration with Chris Lorenzo called \\"The Calling\\". Their second collaboration was premiered on Mixmag and they were hailed as a \\"seemingly perfect match\\". Alongside these 5 originals, he also released the remix of Calvin Harris & Disciple's \\"How Deep is Your Love\\", which had received over 80 million streams accumulative and was one of the most popular house remixes on Soundcloud of the year. 2016 saw Lake release a handful of very popular remixes, the first of which being Jess Glynne's \\"Hold My Hand\\", which received over 3 million streams across various platforms. Shortly after, his official remix for Craig David's \\"Nothing Like This\\" was released on FFRR Records and received a significant amount of DJ support throughout Europe. But his most notable 2016 remix was for Missy Elliot's \\"WTF (Where They From)\\" on Big Beat/Atlantic - which ended up being the top release on the package. Additionally, Insomniac featured the remix and said \\"there's nothing not to like here\\". In 2017, Lake released \\"Operator\\" and launched his own music label Black Book Records. Aside from his new label, he curated OWSLA's HOWSLA compilation with Skrillex, which was featured in Billboard and reached number 1 on the iTunes electronic chart. The compilation consisted of 12 tracks, including Lake's release \\"I Want You\\" which is currently 1001tracklists' third most supported song, for the 10th week in a row. On 29 January 2019, it was announced that Lake would be performing at the Indy 500 Snake Pit on 26 May, 2019 along with Skrillex, Alesso and Illenium. Previous performers have included Axwell ^ Ingrosso, deadmau5, Diplo, GRiZ, Zedd, Marshmello, Martin Garrix, Steve Aoki, Kaskade, Hardwell, Dillon Francis and Zeds Dead.

In 1472, the title of Count of Alba de Tormes, inherited by Garc√≠a √Ålvarez de Toledo, was elevated to the title of Duke of Alba de Tormes by King Henry IV of Castile. History The dukedom of Alba de Tormes is one of the most significant noble titles of Spain and gives its name to the House of Alba. Over the centuries, members of three distinct family dynasties have held the title in succession ‚Äì the , the House of Silva (extinct in 1802) and the House of Fitz-James Stuart, which descends from an illegitimate son of King James II of England. Famous holders of this dukedom include Don Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, governor of the Spanish Netherlands (references to \\"Alba\\" (or \\"Alva\\" in Dutch), particularly in the context of Dutch history, are usually about him), and Do√±a Mar√≠a del Pilar de Silva, 13th Duchess of Alba, a muse of the painter Francisco Goya. Various dukes have married into the families of Christopher Columbus and Cosimo de Medici, as well as the line of the Dukes of Berwick, making them distant relatives of the Earls Spencer and the Dukes of Marlborough. Today, the ducal family of Alba retains a large and valuable collection of art and historic documents.

He appears to have been a follower of Andrea Orcagna to judge by only one work known to be by Traini: in 1345 he signed and dated a polyptych of the Pisan church of S. Caterina, showing Saint Dominic and a predella showing eight hagiographic scenes from the saint's life, now in the Museo Nazionale, Pisa. Most scholars attribute many of the huge frescoes of the Camposanto Monumentale in Pisa to Traini, including the Last Judgement, Inferno, Legends of the Hermits and, the famous Il Trionfo della Morte (the Triumph of Death). There are Traini paintings at the Princeton University Art Museum, Ackland Art Museum, and an Allegorical Representation of Crucifixion with Saints Andrew and Paul at the Carnegie Art Museum. Triumph of Death Though other scholars attribute it to Buonamico Buffalmacco, the Trionfo della Morte was used by the art historian Millard Meiss in 1951 as a fundamental example (the other being Andrea Orcagna's \\"Strozzi Altarpiece\\") to prove his theory on the influence of the Black Death on contemporary spirituality. He believed the painting, which displays the merciless omnipresence of death, to be a reaction to the horrors of the black death of 1348, as was the contemporaneous Totentanz (\\"Dance of Death\\") paintings in Germany. However, this fresco cycle was re-dated by Polzer to 1333-36 because of French contemporary paintings inspired by these ones and because of its Guelph political meaning, and Pisa was only Guelph for a short period in the mid 1330s; this meant, of course, that the frescoes cannot be an example of post-Black Death art as Meiss had originally suggested. In fact, since the painting was originally on the exterior wall of the town cemetery in Pisa, its function was just that of reminding the viewer of the certainty of death and the need for salvation through the church. The imagery is not, then, influenced by recent suffering and death caused by the plague but by mortality. Designed by a member of the Dominican College at Pisa, the fresco reflects the ideals of the order and its emphasis on judgement and the need for people to turn away from the temptations of the world; it promotes Mendicant poverty and cautions against earthly pleasure. It articulates a view of society, put forward by the Dominican Order in which sinfulness is the cause of suffering. The background space is not treated naturalistically but establishes divisions between the different, symbolic groups of figures. Each spatial zone refers to a different idea being communicated such as temptation, judgment, death, and suffering. The landscape is treated symbolically. The rocky area represents the hermit's asceticism while the fertile area earthly pleasures. American historian Barbara Tuchman examined the Traini fresco and described it thus: \\"A scroll warns that 'no shield of wisdom or riches, nobility or prowess' can protect them from the blows of the Approaching One. 'They have taken more pleasure in the world than in things of God.' In a heap of corpses nearby lie crowned rulers, a Pope in tiara, a knight, tumbled together with the bodies of the poor, while angels and devils in the sky contend for the miniature naked figures that represent their souls.\\"Barbara Tuchman, The Black Plague , accessed May 6, 2010 The frescoes of the Camposanto were unfortunately either severely damaged or destroyed by Allied air raids in World War II.

The specific epithet adnata is Latin for \\"broadly attached\\" and refers to the base of the lamina. Botanical history Nepenthes adnata was first collected by Willem Meijer on August 24, 1957. The holotype, Meijer 6941, was collected on that date near the river Tjampo, east of Payakumbuh, Taram, West Sumatra, at an elevation of 1000 m. It is deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The species was first described in 1986 by Mitsuru Hotta and Rusjdi Tamin based on specimens the authors collected near Harau in West Sumatra. Tamin, R. & M. Hotta 1986. Nepenthes di Sumatera: The genus Nepenthes of the Sumatra Island. In: M. Hotta (ed.) Diversity and Dynamics of Plant Life in Sumatra: Forest Ecosystem and Speciation in Wet Tropical Environments. Part 1: Reports and Collection of Papers. Kyoto University, Kyoto. pp. 75‚Äì109. However, the description was invalid as it lacked a Latin diagnosis.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. This was provided eight years later by Jan Schlauer. Description Nepenthes adnata is a diminutive species. The stem is cylindrical in cross section and may be climbing or drooping. It rarely exceeds 2 m in length and 3 mm in diameter. Internodes are up to 10 cm long. Leaves are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina is lanceolate-ellipsoidal and may be up to 10 cm long and 2 cm wide. It has an adnate base and an obtuse to acute apex. Two to three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are not easily distinguished. Tendrils may be up to 5 cm long. A rosette plant with lower pitchers Rosette and lower pitchers are ovoid in the lower third and cylindrical above. They are small, reaching only 10 cm in height and 2.5 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§3 mm wide) runs down the front of terrestrial pitchers. The glandular region covers only the lower third of the inner pitcher surface. The pitcher mouth is round and slightly oblique throughout. The cylindrical peristome is up to 2 mm wide and bears indistinct teeth. The peristome is roughly symmetrical in cross section, with the inner portion accounting for around 54% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The lid or operculum is orbicular and cordate at the base. Multicellular hairs are sometimes present on its upper surface. An unbranched spur (‚â§2 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid. Upper pitcher of N. adnata Upper pitchers are ovoid in the lower quarter and cylindrical to infundibular above. In aerial pitchers, the wings are usually reduced to ribs, but sometimes bear fringe elements. In most other respects, they are similar to lower pitchers. Nepenthes adnata has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 8 cm long. In male plants, the rachis reaches 10 cm in length, while in female plants it rarely exceeds 7 cm. Pedicels lack bracteoles and are up to 10 mm long. Sepals are lanceolate-ovate and around 4 mm long. Fruits are up to 40 mm long. Short brown hairs are present on the edges of the lamina. The stem and lamina bear a sparse indumentum of simple white hairs (‚â§2 mm long). Inflorescences are covered with short, red-brown hairs. The pitchers of N. adnata are generally speckled with reddish-purple blotches. The peristome is usually dark purple. The inner pitcher surface is white to light green. The stem and lamina are green throughout. Nepenthes adnata varies little across its range. Consequently, no infraspecific taxa have been described. Ecology N. adnata in its natural habitat, growing among mosses Nepenthes adnata is endemic to the mountains of the Tjampo river region of West Sumatra. Most ridges in this area have an elevation of just below 1000 m, although several exceed this height.Laumonier, Y. 1997. Geobotany 22: The Vegetation and Physiography of Sumatra. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 600 to 1200 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. It grows on mossy sandstone cliff faces amongst dense vegetation. The habitat is moist and receives diffused sunlight.Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Another Nice Trip to Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4‚Äì10. In its natural habitat, the species occurs sympatrically with N. tenuis and grows in close proximity to N. albomarginata, N. ampullaria, N. eustachya, N. gracilis, N. longifolia, and N. reinwardtiana. Despite this, N. adnata has no known natural hybrids. In Kelok Sembilan, the species has been found to grow alongside Utricularia striatula, a distantly related carnivorous plant. Only two collections of this species have been made and these correspond to two populations separated by several kilometres of mountainous terrain. The species may be more widespread in the region, but most cliffs in the Tjampo river area are virtually inaccessible by foot, making the discovery of new localities unlikely in the near future. The only population that is easily accessible is very small and frequently visited by plant collectors. Charles Clarke considers this population \\"severely threatened\\". The habitat of this species may be threatened in the near future by fires deliberately started to clear forest for agricultural purposes. Related species Scrambling stem of N. tentaculata Nepenthes adnata has no obvious close relatives within the genus. Rusjdi Tamin and Mitsuru Hotta considered the species to be closely related to N. tentaculata, N. gracillima, and N. gracilis. Both Jan Schlauer and Joachim Nerz as well as Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek agreed that N. adnata and N. tentaculata are related, while J. H. Adam, C. C. Wilcock and M. D. Swaine considered the two taxa conspecific.Adam, J.H., C.C. Wilcock & M.D. Swaine 1992. The ecology and distribution of Bornean Nepenthes. Journal of Tropical Forest Science 5(1): 13‚Äì25. However, Charles Clarke does not support this interpretation, stating that the similarities between the two species are probably coincidental and that the closest relatives of N. adnata \\"are more likely to be other Sumatran species such as N. gymnamphora, N. longifolia or N. albomarginata\\". Clarke points out that the multicellular hairs sometimes exhibited by N.adnata, which several authors have used to suggest a relationship with N. tentaculata, occur in rosette pitchers of many other species, especially N. rafflesiana. The pitchers of N. adnata are similar to those of N. tobaica, although the stem and lamina are quite different. They also bear a superficial resemblance to those of a form of N. gymnamphora from Mount Sorik Merapi. Seedlings of N. adnata and N. longifolia are virtually indistinguishable, although mature plants have few morphological features in common. N. adnata also shares with N. albomarginata a similar indumentum and ecology. In 2001, Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon.

It has an extremely unusual pitcher morphology, having an almost vertical opening to its traps.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. It is critically endangered by overcollection. The specific epithet aristolochioides is formed from the genus name Aristolochia and the Latin ending -oides, meaning \\"resembling\\". It refers to the similarity that the pitchers of this species bear, in both shape and pigmentation, to the specialised flowers of Aristolochia. Botanical history Nepenthes aristolochioides was first collected by Willem Meijer on August 5, 1956. The holotype, Meijer 6542, was collected on that date from Mount Tujuh (Tudjuh) in Jambi at an elevation of 2000 m. It is deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands (L) in Leiden, but is in relatively poor condition.Nerz, J. 1998. Rediscovery of an outstanding Nepenthes: N. aristolochioides (Nepenthaceae). Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 27(3): 101‚Äì114. An isotype is held at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens (formerly the Herbarium of the Buitenzorg Botanic Gardens) in Java.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Although labelled as \\"new species?\\", the specimen was largely overlooked for over 30 years. In 1988, botanist Joachim Nerz became aware of it upon visiting the herbarium of Leiden University. The name N. aristolochioides was coined quite early on; it was already being used in 1994 to informally refer to this (at the time undescribed) taxon.Jebb, M. 1994. NEPENTHES revision for Flora Malesiana. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, September 9, 1994. That same year, taxonomist Jan Schlauer questioned the supposed lateral pitcher mouth of N. aristolochioides in email correspondence with botanist Matthew Jebb, who was preparing a revision of the genus at the time.Schlauer, J. 1994. NEPENTHES comments for Flora Malesiana. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, September 9, 1994. Schlauer wrote that he had examined a specimen of this species (Meijer 7426) and that the seemingly vertical insertion of the pitcher mouth might be a result of the preservation process, whereby the traps had become \\"compressed along their longitudinal axes\\". In the summer of 1996, Nerz met with Schlauer and Meijer in the Frankfurt Palmengarten, where Meijer showed him a photograph of the mysterious species. Together with Katrin Hinderhofer, Nerz organised a field trip to Sumatra in June 1996 and was successful in rediscovering N. aristolochioides in the wild. Nepenthes aristolochioides was finally described by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek in their monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", published in the May 1997 issue of the botanical journal Blumea.Nepenthes aristolochioides M.Jebb & Cheek. International Plant Names Index (IPNI).Schlauer, J. Nepenthes aristolochioides. Carnivorous Plant Database. Joachim Nerz wrote a detailed description of the species for an issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter published the following year. The next major treatments of the species appeared in Cheek and Jebb's updated 2001 work, \\"Nepenthaceae\\";Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1‚Äì157. Charles Clarke's Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, also published in 2001; and Stewart McPherson's two-volume Pitcher Plants of the Old World, released in 2009, which included colour photographs of specimens from a newly discovered locality. Description Nepenthes aristolochioides is a climbing plant. The stem, which may be branched, is terete and grows to 8 m in length and 5 mm in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical to obtusely angular in cross section and up to 15 cm long. Axillary buds are notably conspicuous in this species and are located 1.5‚Äì7 mm above the leaf axils. =Leaves= Leaves are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina is linear, lanceolate or spathulate-lanceolate in form and up to 20 cm long by 5 cm wide. It has an acute or obtuse apex that may rarely be sub- peltate. It is gradually attenuate towards the base, becoming partly amplexicaul (clasping the stem for one-third to half of its circumference) and, rarely, slightly decurrent. Leaves of short stems have rounded auricles, whereas those of climbing stems lack auricles. Two to five longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. They arise from the leaf base and occasionally along the length of the midrib, and are restricted to the distal third to two-thirds of the lamina, where they run parallel to the laminar margin. These longitudinal veins are indistinct in dried specimens. Pinnate veins are irregularly reticulate and indistinct. They are few in number and arise obliquely to eventually curve towards the laminar apex. The lower laminar surface bears sessile glands. Tendrils reach 15 cm in length. Those bearing rosette pitchers are typically around twice as long as the laminae and do not have a curl. =Pitchers= Nepenthes aristolochioides is noted for exhibiting relatively little dimorphism between its lower and upper pitchers. Rosette and lower pitchers are only briefly produced on small rosettes before the plant begins to climb, or on offshoots from the climbing stem. They arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 3‚Äì5 mm wide curve. They are broadly infundibular in the lower two-thirds and globose above, forming a dome above the pitcher opening. They reach 7 cm in height and 3 cm in width. A pair of wings (‚â§9 mm wide) runs down the front of the pitcher, either covering the length of the trap's ventral surface or being restricted to the upper part only. These wings bear fringe elements up to 10 mm long. The pitcher mouth is orbicular to ovate and up to 1.5 cm in diameter. It has a horizontal, oblique or almost vertical insertion. The glandular region covers almost the entire inner surface of the pitcher, but is often missing from the uppermost parts of the pitcher dome. The waxy zone typical of many Nepenthes species is absent. Digestive glands are overarched; the lower ones measure 0.2‚Äì0.3 mm in diameter and are present at a density of around 200/cm2, whereas the upper ones are smaller and present at a density of around 500/cm2. The flattened peristome is broad, greatly incurved, and up to 20 mm wide. Its ribs are spaced up to 0.5 mm apart. Its inner margin is lined with small teeth that are curled at their apices and are 2‚Äì3 times as long as they are broad. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 82% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The pitcher lid or operculum is orbicular-cordate or ovate, up to 1.5 cm wide, and bears no appendages. Large nectar glands are present on the lid's entire lower surface, particularly around the midline. Three prominent veins are usually present on either side of the lid's midline. A broad and flattened spur (‚â§7 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid. It has been variously described as either branched or unbranched (simple). A pitcher of N. aristolochioides in longitudinal section, showing the broad, incurved peristome and extensive glandular region Upper pitchers gradually arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 10 mm wide curve. They are narrowly infundibular in the lower half and utriculate above, with a pronounced dome above the pitcher orifice. The ventral face of the trap is often noticeably flattened and is around 30% thicker than the wall of the translucent dome. Aerial traps are larger than their terrestrial counterparts, reaching 15 cm in height and 8 cm in width. They typically bear ribs in place of wings, although these may not be apparent at all. The pitcher mouth is subapical, ovate to circular, and measures up to 4 cm in diameter. It is angled even more steeply than in lower pitchers and may be positioned almost vertically. The glandular region usually covers the basal two-thirds of the pitcher cup's inner surface, or the pitcher may be wholly glandular. Digestive glands are slightly overarched; those near the bottom are 0.3‚Äì0.4 mm in diameter and occur at a density of around 200/cm2, whereas the upper ones are 0.2‚Äì0.3 mm in diameter and occur at a density of around 250/cm2. The peristome, which is up to 20 mm wide, is expanded, incurved, and internally flattened, forming an \\"entrance corridor\\" similar to a lobster pot.Rice, B. 2007. Carnivorous plants with hybrid trapping strategies. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 36(1): 23‚Äì27. It extends for up to 2 mm on its outer margin, which is rounded. There is often a gap of up to 5 mm between the two lobes of the peristome near the base of the lid. The peristome bears ribs up to 0.8 mm high and spaced up to 0.8 mm apart, which terminate in indistinct teeth that are 2‚Äì3 times as long as they are broad. Large nectaries are located between the ribs. The pitcher lid is orbicular to ovate and is often held roughly horizontally, at a right angle to the pitcher orifice. It has a rounded to emarginate apex and a slightly cordate base, and measures up to 4 cm in length by 3 cm in width. It has no appendages, but bears numerous nectar glands, which are scattered quite evenly across the entire lower surface of the lid. These nectaries are circular to shortly elliptic and thinly bordered, measuring around 0.3 mm in diameter. They become slightly larger and more densely packed around the midline. Their rims are visibly asymmetric and are highest near the apical end of the lid. Three to four prominent veins are present on either side of the lid's midline. The spur is broad and flattened, measuring up to 10 mm in length. It has 2‚Äì4 acute points at its apex, and has been variously described as either simple or branched. =Inflorescence= Nepenthes aristolochioides has a racemose inflorescence up to 30 cm long. Both the peduncle and rachis may be up to 15 cm long, although the latter is usually shorter in female plants. The peduncle is up to 4 mm in diameter. Pedicels are simple-bracteolate and one-flowered. The basalmost ones are up to 12 mm long, whereas those higher up the rachis reach only 6 mm. Tepals are ovate and up to 4 mm long. Fruits are up to 20 mm long and 4 mm wide, and bear lanceolate valves. Seeds are filiform. =Indumentum= Most parts of the plant are glabrous. Where present, the indumentum is inconspicuous; hairs are found on the leaf axils, midribs, laminar margins, and parts of the pitchers (especially around the peristome and on the lid, and in developing pitchers). The indumentum is sparse and consists of short, simple or irregularly branching, appressed hairs, which are white to silver in colour and measure up to 0.2 mm and sometimes even 2 mm in length. =Colouration= The stem, laminae, tendrils and midribs are yellowish-green. On their outer surfaces, pitchers are white to reddish with numerous reddish-brown to purple speckles, with both lower and upper pitchers exhibiting similar colouration. The dark blotches are often denser in the upper part of the pitcher, though the extent of the translucent lighter patches is almost twice as great on the rear of the pitcher as compared to the front. The peristome is usually dark red or purple, being particularly dark in rosette pitchers. The undersurface of the lid is dark red or purple throughout, while the upper surface is speckled like the rest of the pitcher. The inner surface of the pitcher is white to light yellow throughout. Herbarium specimens are brown to dark brown, the preserved pitchers having conspicuous dark spots. Little variation has been observed within natural populations of N. aristolochioides and no infraspecific taxa have been described. Ecology =Distribution and habitat= Nepenthes aristolochioides is endemic to Sumatra and has an altitudinal distribution of 1800‚Äì2500 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. In 2001, Charles Clarke wrote that the species was only known from Mount Tujuh in Jambi, although specimens collected by Herbert Christopher Robinson and Cecil Boden Kloss labelled as being taken from \\"Mt. Kerinci\\" suggested that it may be more widespread in the region. Mount Kerinci is Sumatra's highest peak and neighbours Mount Tujuh.Jacobs, M. 1938. Contributions to the botany of Mount Kerintji and adjacent area in West Central Sumatra‚ÄîI. Annales Bogorienses 3: 45‚Äì79. Clarke noted that since most of the mountain remains unexplored, there is a good chance that N. aristolochioides occurs there as well. The full range of N. aristolochioides on Mount Tujuh is also unknown, since only three of the mountain's seven peaks had been climbed as of 2001. In 2009, Stewart McPherson reported that N. aristolochioides was known from three subpopulations in Kerinci Seblat National Park.McPherson, S. 2009. Nepenthes aristolochioides and Nepenthes klossii. Two of Indonesia's most remarkable plants. Carniflora Australis 7(1): 27‚Äì30.McPherson, S. 2012. Two of Indonesia's most remarkable plants. Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Inc. 103: 16‚Äì19. Of these, one (the type locality on Mount Tujuh) may already be extinct due to poaching by plant collectors; in 2007, E'En Endatno observed only a single N. aristolochioides plant on Mount Tujuh. The other two sites are located on remote peaks and support only \\"a few dozen\\" plants, as determined by McPherson. Nepenthes aristolochioides inhabits Sphagnum-dominated mossy forest near the tops of steep ridges. It usually grows terrestrially, but can also occur as an epiphyte in pockets of moss on tree trunks. The species occurs sympatrically with N. gymnamphora and N. singalana. It grows with the former in montane forest and swamps dominated by Pandanus species that line the shoreline of a crater lake. The altitudinal distribution of N. gymnamphora on Mount Tujuh (1800‚Äì2100 m) overlaps that of N. aristolochioides, but no natural hybrids have been observed. A small form of N. singalana occurs in the same habitat as N. aristolochioides, but appears to occupy a different ecological niche; it is generally confined to the forest floor while N. aristolochioides often climbs into the canopy. A number of plants representing the natural hybrid N. aristolochioides √ó N. singalana have been recorded. =Conservation= The base of a severed climbing stem of N. aristolochioides: the result of plant poaching in Kerinci Seblat National Park Nepenthes aristolochioides is listed as Critically Endangered on the 2013 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its known distribution was restricted to two mountains (Mount Kerinci and Mount Tujuh) at the time of the assessment. Despite the fact that all known populations of the species lie within Kerinci Seblat National Park, it is severely threatened by over-collection, because its unique pitcher morphology makes it particularly sought-after. In 2010, the Rare Nepenthes Collection was established with the aim of conserving 4 of the most endangered Nepenthes species: N. aristolochioides, N. clipeata, N. khasiana, and N. rigidifolia.Ziemer, B. 2010. Exciting conservation news: the Rare Nepenthes Collection project! Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 39(3): 67.Nepenthes aristolochioides. Ark of Life.Bourke, G. 2010. A new conservation initiative: the Rare Nepenthes Collection project. Captive Exotics Newsletter 1(2): 5‚Äì6. =Pitcher infauna= No infaunal organisms have been recorded from the pitchers of N. aristolochioides. This is not due to a lack of potential inhabitants; pitchers of N. singalana, which grow alongside N. aristolochioides, support large populations of such organisms. It is thought that the structure of the traps may serve to disorientate emerging adults and so infaunal species avoid colonising them. Carnivory Different trapping mechanisms have been proposed for the lower and upper pitchers of N. aristolochioides. =Pitfall traps= The lower pitchers of this species frequently develop embedded in Sphagnum moss, with only the top of the traps visible. Joachim Nerz suggested that they act as simple pitfall traps specialised for trapping ground-dwelling insects. The insects crawl into the pitcher through the small mouth and fall to the bottom of the pitcher cup. Unable to climb out, they drown in the digestive fluid. =Light traps= Along with N. klossii, N. aristolochioides is the only species in the genus to employ domed pitchers with translucent patches that allow sunlight to illuminate the interior. When viewed from the front, the peristome and lid appear dark, contrasting heavily against the inner surface of the pitcher, which is brightly lit by light passing through the top of the pitcher dome. It has been suggested that in upper pitchers this adaptation serves to attract flying insects in a similar manner to the North American pitcher plants Darlingtonia californica, Sarracenia minor, and Sarracenia psittacina. A similar trapping mechanism has also been proposed for N. jacquelineae. This is supported by the fact that most of the prey caught by N. aristolochioides consist of small flies, which are attracted to bright light sources. Prey are often disorientated inside the upper pitchers of N. aristolochioides. Unable to find the exit, they eventually fall into the pitcher fluid and drown. As such, the pitchers have features of lobster-pot traps. The central role of the translucent dome in the prey trapping mechanism of N. aristolochioides is supported by experimental evidence. In one study, pitchers whose domes were covered with red celluloid filters showed a threefold decrease in Drosophila trapping efficiency as compared to unaltered pitchers and those shaded at the front with the same filters (flies are red-blind and most sensitive to the UV, blue, and green wavebands).Moran, J.A., C. Clarke & B.E. Gowen 2012. The use of light in prey capture by the tropical pitcher plant Nepenthes aristolochioides. Plant Signaling & Behavior 7(8): 957‚Äì960. =Flypaper traps= Nepenthes aristolochioides produces extremely thick, mucilaginous pitcher liquid, which coats the entire inner surfaces of the traps in a thin film. The pitchers of this species appear to function at least in part as flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid. Similarly viscous pitcher fluid is also found in seven other closely allied Sumatran species: N. dubia, N. flava, N. inermis, N. jacquelineae, N. jamban, N. talangensis, and N. tenuis. Together with N. aristolochioides, these species all share infundibular pitchers that are wholly glandular or almost so. Related species The unusual pitcher morphology of N. aristolochioides makes it difficult to confuse with any other species; the almost vertical orientation of the pitcher mouth is a unique characteristic. Joachim Nerz noted that N. aristolochioides shows \\"close affinities\\" to N. talangensis. However, it may be easily distinguished from that species on the basis of the pitcher mouth, which is horizontal in N. talangensis. In addition, the pitcher mouth of N. talangensis is elongated into a short neck, whereas N. aristolochioides lacks a neck altogether, with the lid being inserted in front of the pitcher. Both the mouth and lid are considerably larger in N. talangensis. The two taxa also differ somewhat in growth habit; N. talangensis occurs only terrestrially and is a weak climber, whereas N. aristolochioides occasionally grows as an epiphyte and climbs high into the forest canopy.Nerz, J. & A. Wistuba 1994. Five new taxa of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North and West Sumatra . Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 23(4): 101‚Äì114. The laminar morphology of N. aristolochioides is also similar to that of N. bongso, although N. aristolochioides is easily distinguished from this species by the shape of its pitchers and the hooded nectaries of the lid. In 2001, Charles Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is part of the resultant cladogram, showing \\"Clade 1\\", which has 51% bootstrap support. Its most strongly supported subclade is the sister pair of N. inermis and N. dubia, having 95% support. Although N. aristolochioides resembles N. klossii in some respects, the two species are geographically isolated from each other and are not thought to be closely related. The unique adaptations of these taxa might represent an example of convergent evolution, whereby two organisms that are not closely related independently acquire similar characteristics while evolving in separate, but comparable, ecosystems. Natural hybrids Only one natural hybrid involving N. aristolochioides is known. Nepenthes aristolochioides √ó N. singalana has been found in dense mossy forest on two ridges of Mount Tujuh, only one of which is populated by N. aristolochioides. It is relatively rare, which suggests that the two species flower at different times of the year. This hybrid is smaller than either of its parent species; the pitchers rarely exceed 5 cm in height. The lower pitchers resemble those of N. talangensis, but differ in having more pronounced peristome teeth. Upper pitchers are infundibular in the lower parts, ovoid in the middle, and cylindrical in the upper parts. This hybrid can be distinguished from N. aristolochioides on the basis of its narrow, cylindrical peristome and oblique mouth, as opposed to almost vertical in the latter.

The genus contains five species, all endemic to New Guinea. The males have highly iridescent plumage and remarkably long tails. Females are duller and have shorter tails. Barnes's astrapia is a hybrid produced by the interbreeding of Princess Stephanie's astrapia and the ribbon-tailed astrapia. Brown: Carina.  Taxonomy and systematics  Astrapia is derived from the Greek 'astrapios' or 'astrapaios', meaning lightning or a flash of lightning, possibly a reference to the iridescence of the plumage. The genus is suggested to be monophyletic, roughly six million years old, and forms a sister-group with the two species in the genus Paradigalla. Astrapia and Paradigalla are members of a larger clade that includes the other long-tail birds-of-paradise from the genus Epimachus. = Species = * Arfak astrapia, Astrapia nigra * Splendid astrapia, Astrapia splendidissima * Ribbon-tailed astrapia, Astrapia mayeri * Princess Stephanie's astrapia, Astrapia stephaniae * Huon astrapia, Astrapia rothschildi Within the genus, A. nigra and A. splendidissima are sister species, which together are sister to a clade that includes A. rothschildi, A. mayeri and A. stephaniae with A. rothschildi as the basal member.  Description  The five species of the genus Astrapia are endemic to New Guinea in the mountains of Volgelkop, the central ranges and the Huon Peninsula. Of these, three are allopatric‚ÄîA. nigra, A. splendidissima and A. rothschildi. The other two‚ÄîA. mayeri and A. stephaniae‚Äîoverlap with each other at the margins of their respective elevation ranges in a small part of Papua New Guinea's central highlands. All species within Astrapia exhibit sexual dimorphism. Adult males appear mostly jet-black under most lighting conditions, with highly iridescent greenish-blue heads, an intensely reflective coppery-orange band on the upper breast and either a deep violet (nearly black) or mostly white tail. The three allopatric species also have iridescent green lower abdomen. Adult females are duller blackish-brown, with smaller, white smudged tails running down their lengths.  Behavior  = Mating and breeding = Breeding behaviors are not well known, but all species are thought to be polygamous, with promiscuous males that use arboreal display sites, and with females providing all parental care. Summaries from species accounts indicate a few simple behaviors including a form of hoping back and forth between branches and an inverted display posture in A. rothschildi. At traditional sites in the forest canopy, Astrapia stephaniae is known to form leks. There are seven distinct male courtship displays that have been documented: perch-hopping, pivoting, inverted tail-fanning, nape-pecking, post-copulatory tumbling, upright sleeked posturing and branch-sidling. Of the male behaviors, perch-hopping is the most broadly distributed among all species but A. nigra. In all of them, the displaying bird moves quickly between multiple branches by hopping or making short flight-hops. In A. rothschildi, hopping between perches sometimes includes chasing females (or female plumaged individuals). It is unclear if chasing is a component of perch-hopping in the other species. Ribbon-tailed Astrapia, Papua New Guinea A type of pivot display is known from two species, A. rothschildi and A. mayeri. In both, it involves repeatedly moving in a ritualized fashion from side-to-side with feet more-or-less in a fixed position. The most distinctive feature of the A. rothschildi pivot is wing flicking whereas in A. mayeri, the most distinctive features are the very ritualized hunchbacked posture and the highly exaggerated swishing movement of the male‚Äôs long ribbon-like tail. The Arfak astrapia and the Huon astrapia have a distinctive and specialized display behavior, which is called the inverted tail-fan display. When the abdominal feathers are sky-oriented during the display, their green iridescent feathers (that would appear otherwise dark) become highly visible; the splendid astrapia also has highly iridescent green abdominal plumage, which begs the question about if it too has an undocumented inverted display behavior.

Geoffrey is the leader of the Pride, a supervillain crime ring in Los Angeles.Runaways: Volume 1, #2 He is the father of Alex Wilder. Geoffrey Wilder was played by Ryan Sands in the Hulu TV series Runaways set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is considered a father who is just trying to protect his family by doing heinous tasks. Publication history Geoffrey Wilder first appeared in Runaways #1 and was created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona. Fictional character biography Geoffrey Wilder and his recent bride Catherine were lowly thieves in 1984 Los Angeles. After a heist, they were abducted by the Gibborim, a group of giants who needed them to bring their plan to fruition. Along with five other couples, the Wilders formed the Pride, which was a group dedicated to bringing about the end of the world for the Gibborim. Each couple had their unique powers augmented by the Gibborim, meaning that Geoffrey and Catherine's shrewdness was increased, allowing them to become the Kingpins of the West Coast. They controlled drugs and prostitution in LA as well as controlling the Pride's moles in various police forces. The Gibborim also promised that 6 of the 12 members of the Pride would be saved after the world ended. However, a few years later, the couples decided to each have a single child and have their children be saved.Runaways #1 Nearly two decades later, Geoffrey's son Alex began to get suspicious of his parents' activities. Geoffrey was a strict father to Alex, looking down on his obsession with internet games and computer skills. This may have been responsible for driving Alex to spying on his parents and learning of the Pride. This act led to the creation of the Runaways. While the children of the Pride were on the run, Geoffrey and the other members of the Pride organized the LAPD to find their children by framing them for the death of a girl killed by the Pride as well as the kidnapping of Molly Hayes, one of the children of the Pride. Eventually, the Runaways and the Pride met in a final showdown in an undersea structure. The Runaways were able to stop the Pride's plan to offer a sacrifice to the Gibborim, which led to the death of Alex Wilder, who had turned out to be loyal to the Pride. The death of his son left Geoffrey distraught in his last few moments alive, as the Gibborim went on to destroy the structure, killing the entire Pride just after the Runaways made their getaway. =1985 version= A few months later, a few of Alex's friends from his online gaming found out about Alex's death as well as some files from Alex's computer. The files talked about how the Pride was a group of heroes (as opposed to villains as reported by The Daily Bugle), and had a ritual detailing how to bring Alex back. However, when the people performed the spell, they brought Geoff back by accident. The Geoff they raised from the dead is the 1985 version, as he mentions that he was only with the Pride for a year. Geoffrey reformed the Pride using Alex's friends as the other members, planning to use them to regain favor with the Gibborim by sacrificing one of the Runaways (a plot the other members of the new Pride were unaware of). It is revealed that Geoffrey was upset to learn of the future death of his wife and son and wanted the Gibborim to resurrect them. During this period, he temporarily posed as the mutant Chamber to infiltrate the super-team Excelsior and get information on the Runaways, before leaving the team. Wilder is eventually stopped by the Runaways, but manages to impale and kill Gertrude Yorkes. The Runaways then erase his memory from his time in 2006, and send him back to 1985. It is then revealed he lost his Abstract ring, and that Chase Stein has gained it. Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Geoffrey Wilder is the attorney general of the United States working under President Steve Rogers.Ultimate Comics Ultimates #22 In other media *Geoffrey Wilder appears in the Hulu TV series adaptation of Runaways, portrayed by Ryan Sands. Geoffrey has a better relationship with his son and tries to connect with him. Though he is still involved with the Pride, his wife Catherine appears to be the more dominant of the two. He is depicted as being the most reluctant to follow through with sacrificing Destiny Gonzalez even saying \\"I'm sorry\\" to her when she realizes what is happening. His background is explored with him once having been part of a gang with his crew mate Darius Davis (played by DeVaughn Nixon). While in prison, Geoffrey was approached by a mysterious man named Jonah (played by Julian McMahon). With guidance from Catherine, who at the time was his lawyer, Geoffrey opts to enter the realtor business and convinces Darius to take the blame for shooting a man. In return, Geoffrey would take care of his family. However, in the present day, Geoffrey does not keep up his end of the bargain and Darius is left out in the cold upon his own release from prison. He attempts to extort money from him, but is thwarted with a threat to his aunt. Geoffrey is forced to act when his son, Alex, is kidnapped and held ransom by Darius. Geoffrey gets Lieutenant Flores to send some men to help him. During the gun fight, Darius' right hand man Andre is shot and Geoffrey decides to use him for the Pride's next sacrifice to energize Jonah. His relationship with Alex begins to fall apart. Geoffrey's construction company is revealed to really be digging for an unknown substance hidden under Los Angeles. He along with Catherine and the rest of the Pride are later informed by Jonah, who learns through Frank Dean, that their kids are fully aware of their activities. He and the Pride attempt to stop their kids from destroying everything they have built towards. Geoffrey and Catherine soon become concerned for Alex's well being when Jonah threatens him and the other Pride members' kids.

Family  Born at Liria Palace in Madrid on 28 March 1926, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart was the only child of the 17th Duke of Alba (a prominent Spanish politician and diplomat during the 1930s and 1940s) by his wife, Mar√≠a del Rosario de Silva y Gurtubay, 9th Marchioness of San Vicente del Barco. Her godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenie, the wife of King Alfonso XIII of Spain.  Socialite  As a socialite, the duchess met famous VIPs from Spain and abroad. Jackie Kennedy visited her Seville palace, as did Wallis Simpson, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III of Monaco. In 1959 the duchess, together with designer Yves Saint Laurent, hosted a Dior show for charitable purposes in her Liria Palace, Madrid, a palace which movie stars Charlton Heston, Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn and Raf Vallone visited. In her youth the duchess posed for Richard Avedon and Cecil Beaton and she appeared on the cover of Time and Harper's Bazaar. She was inducted into Vanity Fair's International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 2011. Marriages On 12 October 1947, the Duchess married Don Luis Mart√≠nez de Irujo y Art√°zcoz (1919‚Äì1972), younger son of the Duke of Sotomayor and his wife Ana Mar√≠a de Art√°zcoz y Labayen (1892-1930), court lady of Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain. The wedding in Spain, two years after the end of World War II, resisted the decline in frequency of very extravagant European weddings among high nobility and attracted the attention of the international media. The New York Times called it \\"the most expensive wedding of the world.\\" It was reported that 20 million pesetas (equivalent to $10,000,000 rounded in 2015) was spent. Six children were born of this marriage: * Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 19th Duke of Alba (born 2 October 1948, Madrid) * Alfonso Mart√≠nez de Irujo y Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duke of H√≠jar (born 22 October 1950, Madrid) * Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Mart√≠nez de Irujo, 23rd Count of Siruela (born 15 July 1954, Madrid) * Fernando Mart√≠nez de Irujo y Fitz-James Stuart, 11th Marquis of San Vicente del Barco (born 11 July 1959) * Cayetano Mart√≠nez de Irujo y Fitz-James Stuart, 4th Duke of Arjona, 13th Count of Salvatierra (born 4 April 1963, Madrid) *Eugenia Mart√≠nez de Irujo, 12th Duchess of Montoro (born 26 November 1968) √Ångel Peralta in 1961 Widowed in 1972, the Duchess remarried first on 16 March 1978 Jes√∫s Aguirre y Ortiz de Z√°rate (1934‚Äì2001), a Doctor of Theology and a former Jesuit priest. The wedding caused shock; Aguirre was illegitimate, which carried a stigma among the wealthy and devout in 1970s Spain. Eight years younger than the Duchess, he maintained a good relationship with her children. During their marriage he administered, with his stepson Carlos, the Alba estates. Aguirre died in 2001. The re-widowed Duchess expressed her wish to marry Alfonso D√≠ez Carabantes in the 2000s, a civil servant who separately had a public relations business, 24 years her junior. It was reported objections came from her children and from King Juan Carlos. The House of Alba in 2008 issued a statement saying that the relationship \\"was based on a long friendship and there are no plans to marry\\". The duchess decided to proceed and gave her children their inheritance which included majestic palaces in Spain, paintings by old and modern masters (from Fra Angelico, Titian and Goya to Renoir and Marc Chagall), a first-edition copy of Cervantes's Don Quixote, letters written by Christopher Columbus, and substantial land; her wealth was estimated at between ‚Ç¨600 million and ‚Ç¨3.5 billion. D√≠ez formally renounced any claim to her wealth. They married on 5 October 2011 at the Palacio de las Due√±as in Seville. The Duchess, whose passions included flamenco, performed a quick few steps of the dance in front of the crowds that had gathered outside the palace on the day of the wedding. Death Statue in Seville The Duchess died in the Palacio de las Due√±as on 20 November 2014, at the age of 88. She was succeeded by her son Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 14th Duke of Hu√©scar, who thus became the 19th Duke of Alba. At the time of her death, her net worth was estimated to be $5 billion. The Duchess' body was laid in repose at the Town Hall, where thousands of Sevillans paid their last respects. Pictures of the Duchess with her family were placed at her coffin. The King of Spain telephoned her son to pay his respects and sent two flower crowns to Seville. The Lord Mayor said that the flags of the city would be lowered in mourning. Msgrs. Juan Jos√© Asenjo and Curro Romero, and Mr. Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, also formally paid their respects. Her funeral was held at Seville Cathedral by Msgr. Carlos Amigo Vallejo, where the Royal Family was represented by the Infanta Elena. Titles, styles, honours and arms As head of the dynasty, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart was styled by her most senior title of \\"Duchess of Alba\\", whilst holding over 40 other hereditary titles. According to Guinness World Records, she was the most titled aristocrat in the world. =Titles= ;Dukedoms *18th Duchess of Alba, Grandee of Spain *15th Duchess of Aliaga, Grandee of Spain -Ceded to her

These were Stone & Chin 15238, deposited at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia near Kuala Lumpur (KLU), and Shah & Shukor 3168, also held at KLU as well as the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia in Kepong (KEP). They noted that the plants exhibited some unusual morphological features, such as larger leaves and decurrent, almost petiolate leaf bases, suggesting that they might represent an as-yet undescribed taxon. Bukit Bakar in 2007 Field studies confirmed that the taxon represented a separate species, and it was formally described as N. benstonei in 1999 by Charles Clarke.Schlauer, J. 2000. Literature reviews. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 29(2): 53. The holotype of N. benstonei, Clarke s.n., was collected by Charles Clarke on 24 July 1998, on Bukit Bakar in Kelantan at an altitude of between 450 and 550 m. It is deposited at the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia in Kepong (KEP). Isotypes are held at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (K), the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden (L), the Forest Department in Sandakan (SAN), and the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SING). =Ridley 16097= Although only described towards the very end of the twentieth century, N. benstonei was probably first collected in July 1911 by Henry Nicholas Ridley on Mount Tahan in Pahang. The Ridley 16097 series comprises three herbarium sheets: one deposited at the Singapore herbarium and two at Kew. The former consists of a climbing stem fragment with two upper pitchers and two female inflorescences. The two sheets at Kew are barcoded K000651565 (climbing stem with immature female inflorescence but no pitchers) and K000651564 (climbing stem with upper pitchers), and differ significantly in morphology. Ridley referred the Ridley 16097 material to N. singalana. For his seminal monograph of 1928, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", B. H. Danser examined the sheet of Ridley 16097 held in Singapore, lumping it with the variable N. alata from the Philippines. Danser briefly mentioned this specimen in his discussion of N. alata: > The specimen recorded by me from the Malay Peninsula deviates more [from N. > alata], especially by the long, narrow inflorescence and 2-flowered > pedicels, but also in the Philippines and Sumatra forms with 2-flowered > pedicels have been found (Ramos 14650, L√∂rzing 11603). Danser also treated N. eustachya from Sumatra in synonymy with N. alata, giving rise to a taxon with a puzzling geographical distribution: widespread across Sumatra and the Philippines, apparently very rare in the Malay Peninsula (Ridley 16097 being the sole record), and completely unknown from Borneo and the other major islands of the Malay Archipelago. In 1990, Ruth Kiew identified Ridley 16097 as belonging to N. gracillima. Kiew explained the apparent near-absence of N. alata from Peninsular Malaysia as follows: > Why has this species not been recollected since 1911 in spite of several > botanical expeditions to G. Tahan since then? The answer is quite simple, > Ridley's specimen (16097) actually belongs to N. gracillima. Although N. > alata Blanco is superficially similar to N. gracillima in its narrow leaf > blade which has an attenuate base, the pitchers of these two species are > distinct. Those of N. alata are broader (about 4 cm wide) and are distinctly > bulbous towards the base compared with the very slender, non-bulbous > pitchers of N. gracillima that are 1.5 to 3 cm wide. Nor does the G. Tahan > specimen have truly petiolate leaves - its leaf base is narrow and has > rolled up during drying. Ridley's specimen from G. Tahan determined by > Danser as N. alata bears pitchers typical of N. gracillima and examination > of the Tahan population in the field leaves no doubt that it belongs to this > species. Jebb and Cheek supported this interpretation in their 1997 monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", and in their 2001 treatment for Flora Malesiana, \\"Nepenthaceae\\". They also restored N. eustachya as a separate species, making N. alata a Philippine endemic once again ‚Äî a circumscription that has been accepted by subsequent authors. However, in his 2001 book, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, Charles Clarke disagreed with Kiew's identification of Ridley 16097 as N. gracillima. He noted that the inflorescences of both N. gracillima and the closely related N. ramispina are very short, rarely exceeding 10 and 20 cm, respectively. Both female inflorescences of Ridley 16097 have a long peduncle and rachis, each exceeding 20 cm in length. In addition, the flowers of these species are almost always borne on pedicels, unlike those of Ridley 16097, which mostly have two-flowered partial peduncles.Shivas, R.G. 1984. Pitcher Plants of Peninsular Malaysia & Singapore. Maruzen Asia, Kuala Lumpur. Furthermore, the shape of the lamina is unlike that of N. gracillima or N. ramispina; despite being narrow and lanceolate, it is proportionately considerably longer and has a much narrower, almost sub-petiolate base. Kiew partly attributed the narrower leaf bases of Ridley 16097 to a preservation artefact, but Clarke stated that this explanation could not fully account for the differences. He also noted that the specimen exhibits a decurrent leaf attachment. Taking all of these morphological features into account, Clarke felt that Ridley 16097 most likely represented a specimen of N. benstonei.Clarke, C.M. 2006. Introduction. In: Danser, B.H. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. pp. 1‚Äì15. At the time, he believed that Kiew had grouped both N. benstonei and N. ramispina with N. gracillima.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. But in a 2012 revision of the Nepenthes of Mount Tahan, which included a reappraisal of the taxonomically confused N. alba and N. gracillima, Clarke and Ch'ien Lee concluded that Kiew's concept of N. gracillima had encompassed N. alba, N. benstonei, and N. gracillima. Clarke and Lee also showed that Ridley 16097 represents a mixed collection and that only two of the three sheets belong to N. benstonei; the Kew specimen barcoded K000651564 is representative of N. alba. =Other specimens= In addition to the two sheets of Ridley 16097, populations of N. benstonei from Mount Tahan are represented by the specimen Holttum 20643, held at the herbarium of the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SING). A number of specimens collected from Terengganu also belong to N. benstonei. These are Shah et al. 3274, which is deposited at the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia in Kepong, and Shah et al. 3283, held at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia near Kuala Lumpur.Clarke, C.M. 2002. A Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Specimens from peninsular Thailand originally assigned to N. benstonei in Cheek and Jebb's 2001 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\", have since been identified as belonging to a new species, N. thai. Description Nepenthes benstonei is a climbing plant. The stem, which may be branched, can attain a length of 10 m and is up to 0.6 cm in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical and up to 15 cm long. Leaves are coriaceous and sessile to sub-petiolate. The lamina is usually broadly linear-lanceolate in shape, but may also be slightly spathulate. Its base is a broad, amplexicaul sheath with decurrent margins. The lamina can reach 60 cm in length and 9 cm in width. It has a rounded to acute apex. The margins of the lamina usually meet the tendril unequally on both sides, being up to 3 mm apart. Three to five longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are almost indistinct. Tendrils are up to 60 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers reach 20 cm in height and 5 cm in width. They are ovoid in the lower part and cylindrical above, with a pronounced hip in the middle. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§4 mm wide) runs the whole length of the pitcher cup. The pitcher mouth is round to ovate and oblique throughout. The peristome is up to 6 mm wide and bears very small but distinct teeth along its inner margin. The pitcher lid is ovate and lacks appendages. It bears a short but distinct keel and often has a very broad insertion. A simple or bifurcate spur (‚â§12 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers are similar in most respects to their lower counterparts. They are up to 20 cm high and 3 cm wide. They are infundibular in the lowermost part, narrowly ovoid in the next part, and cylindrical above. The peristome lacks teeth in upper pitchers. The lid is narrower and has a less obtuse apex. The spur is simple and much smaller, reaching only 5 mm in length. Nepenthes benstonei has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 20 cm long and the rachis up to 30 cm long. The first flower is generally borne on a pedicel, sometimes with a simple, lanceolate bracteole (‚â§1.5 cm long). Subsequent flowers are produced on pedicels or two-flowered partial peduncles, which lack bracteoles. Sepals are ovate and around 4 mm long. Male inflorescences usually bear around twice as many flowers as female ones. N. benstonei is one of the few Nepenthes species known to produce multiple inflorescences concurrently on a single stem. Two to three are usually produced, originating from sequential nodes at the top of the stem. This unusual reproductive habit has also been observed, although much more rarely, in N. alba, N. ampullaria, N. attenboroughii, N. rigidifolia, N. sanguinea, and N. thai.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2009. Nepenthes group Montanae (Nepenthaceae) in Indo-China, with N. thai and N. bokor described as new. Kew Bulletin 64(2): 319‚Äì325. It is seen even more frequently in N. philippinensis. The stem and lamina have a sparse indumentum of simple white hairs. Short, branched reddish-brown hairs line the margins of the lamina. The outer surfaces of the pitchers bear a sparse covering of short, branched red hairs. The same hairs are more densely present on the margins of the lid and upper part of the pitcher directly below the peristome. Immature inflorescences have an indumentum of short white and red hairs throughout. The stem and leaves of N. benstonei bear a thick, waxy cuticle that often gives a whitish-blue sheen to the lamina and pitchers. Inflorescences are distinctly waxy throughout. No infraspecific taxa of N. benstonei have been described. Ecology Nepenthes benstonei is endemic to Peninsular Malaysia. It is known with certainty only from the summits of low hills in Kelantan and northern Terengganu, and from Mount Tahan in Taman Negara, Pahang. The species has a relatively wide altitudinal range of 150 to 1350 m above sea level. Nepenthes benstonei grows terrestrially among open, secondary vegetation, where it is exposed to direct sunlight. It is very abundant near the summit of Bukit Bakar, where it grows on cuttings beside a paved road leading to a Telekom Malaysia station at the summit. There, its altitudinal distribution appears to be restricted to 450‚Äì600 m. The species is also present on Mount Tahan, which at 2187 m is the highest mountain in Peninsular Malaysia. Its altitudinal range on Mount Tahan is known to extend from 800 to 1350 m. It is common on the mountain's lower slopes and can be seen along the western summit route from Sungai Relau, particularly on the tops of steep ridges at around 800‚Äì1200 m. It has been recorded growing along the western trail itself and from other disturbed sites, including areas affected by landslides. Plants have also been observed in dense forest, but these bear comparatively few pitchers. Though there were no confirmed reports of N. benstonei from Mount Tahan prior to 2012, the species's presence there is attested by much older herbarium material. Although the extent of its range is uncertain, N. benstonei appears to have a secure future in the wild as the type locality lies within a protected area and the species's unremarkable appearance means over-collection does not pose a serious threat. Related species In his description of N. benstonei, Charles Clarke noted two characteristics that he considered unique among Nepenthes. These were the production of multiple inflorescences and the presence of a thick, waxy cuticle on the leaves. Subsequent field studies have shown that the former is not unique to N. benstonei, but also occasionally occurs in other Nepenthes. Likewise, a number of other species, such as N. hirsuta from Borneo, are known to produce a waxy cuticle, although it is less developed than in N. benstonei. Otherwise, N. benstonei lacks remarkable characteristics and is distinguished from related species on the basis of its stem, leaves, peristome, lid, indumentum, and glands of the digestive zone. Nepenthes benstonei appears to be related to N. sanguinea, which is also native to Peninsular Malaysia. It can be distinguished on the basis of its significantly larger leaves, which are often sub-petiolate and differ in shape. Nepenthes benstonei also has longer tendrils and a denser indumentum. The presence of teeth on the peristome of lower pitchers and of a thick, waxy cuticle on the leaves also serve to distinguish these taxa. In addition, herbarium specimens of N. benstonei tend to dry to a lighter colour than those of N. sanguinea. The pitchers of N. benstonei also resemble those of N. smilesii from Indochina. Clarke suggests that N. benstonei may represent an evolutionary link between the Nepenthes taxa of Indochina and Peninsular Malaysia. Nepenthes benstonei also superficially resembles N. macrovulgaris from Borneo. It differs in producing multiple inflorescences, which are longer than those of N. macrovulgaris and bear one- or two-flowered partial peduncles, as opposed to exclusively two-flowered in the latter. The waxy coating of its leaves also separates these species. Nepenthes benstonei has also been compared to N. albomarginata, although the presence of a white band below the peristome, which gives the latter its name, makes identification easy. Upper pitchers of N. benstonei could be confused with those of N. mirabilis, although all other parts of the plant have little in common. In 2001, Charles Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The resultant cladogram placed N. benstonei in an unresolved polytomy at the base of the Montanae/Nobiles clade, together with N. rhombicaulis. Natural hybrids Only one natural hybrid involving N. benstonei is known.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. A single example of N. benstonei √ó N. mirabilis was discovered by Andrew Hurrell at the foot of Bukit Bakar, where the two species occur sympatrically. Notes References * Meimberg, H. 2002.

The Kosaƒça noble family held lands in the region of Herzegovina. Vladislav received his father's land and the title of herzog. During his father's reign he is known to have interfered with his affairs. After 1453 he was frequently in the service of the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice and the Hungarian-Croatian king Matthias Corvinus. Corvinus granted him the forts of Veliki Kalnik and Mali Kalnik near Kri≈æevci. As an Ottoman vassal (after 1469) he took part in the capture of the town of Poƒçitelj on the river Neretva in 1472 and in battles against the Vlatkoviƒá's of that region. He succeeded in escaping Ottoman rule until 1480 when he was defeated and retreated to Herceg Novi. When Herceg Novi was captured by the Ottomans in the year 1483, Vladislav retreated to the island of Rab under Venetian rule where he would die. He married Anna Kantakouzene, one of the five known daughters of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, in 1453 or 1454.

Joseph Jason Putz (; born February 22, 1977) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, New York Mets, Chicago White Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks. High school and college Born in Trenton, Michigan, Putz led Trenton High School to the 1994 Division 2 state championship. He graduated in 1995 and won the Mr. Baseball award for the state of Michigan. Putz attended the University of Michigan, and played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth- Dennis Red Sox in 1997 and the Hyannis Mets in 1998. Professional career =Seattle Mariners= Putz was drafted by the Mariners in the 6th round in 1999. He made his Major League debut with the Mariners on August 11, . In , he became the closer for the Mariners. All through the minors, Putz had been able to throw an excellent fastball that topped out at 97 miles per hour, but had been only marginally successful because his only other pitch was a below average slider. His first few years in the majors were not terrible, but they were also nothing special. In spring training before the season, Eddie Guardado, who had been the Mariners' closer since , taught him to throw a splitter. After mastering the new secondary pitch, Putz abandoned his slider and became a much improved pitcher. A few weeks into the 2006 season, Putz took over the closing job from the aging Guardado. He converted 36 of 43 save opportunities while posting a 2.30 ERA and striking out 104 in 78.1 innings of work. In 2007, Putz continued to improve his game. He made his first All-Star appearance, where he was given a save opportunity. He converted 40 saves in 42 save opportunities with a 1.38 ERA, 0.698 WHIP, 82 strikeouts and 13 walks in innings. On July 6, 2007, he was named the June 2007 winner of the \\"DHL Presents the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Month Award\\", recognizing the top relief pitcher for the month and on September 25, 2007, Putz was named as one of 10 finalists for the \\"DHL Presents the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Year Award.\\" On July 14, 2007, Putz broke Eddie Guardado's Mariners' consecutive saves record. The streak ended at 30 consecutive saves. In 2007, he also became the first Mariner ever to win the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. =New York Mets= On December 10, 2008, Putz was part of a three-team, twelve-player trade that sent him to the New York Mets in exchange for pitcher Aaron Heilman, utility outfielder Endy Ch√°vez, and prospects. He made his Mets debut on April 6, against the Cincinnati Reds, pitching a hitless inning. After a disappointing 2009 season, on November 6, the Mets declined to exercise Putz's 2010 team option, thus making him a free agent. =Chicago White Sox= On December 11, 2009, Putz signed a one-year contract with the Chicago White Sox worth $3 million. On July 20, 2010, Putz set a Chicago White Sox franchise record by pitching 25 consecutive scoreless outings. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On December 7, 2010, the Arizona Diamondbacks agreed to sign Putz to a 2-year, $10 million deal with a $6.5 million club option for 2013. He earned $4 million in 2011, $4.5 million in 2012, and his option had a $1.5 million buyout. On October 20, 2012, the Diamondbacks exercised his $6.5 million option. On June 20, 2014, Putz was designated for assignment. He was released on June 27. Putz rejoined the Diamondbacks as a special assistant to club president Derrick Hall in November. Pitching style Putz threw a mix of five pitches. He led with four-seam and two-seam fastballs (the latter to lefties, mainly) that were once in the upper 90s, but had settled in the 90-94 mph range.

Oath of Fealty is a 1981 novel by American writer Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, published originally by Phantasia Press, then by Timescape Books, with numerous reprints. Set in the near future, it involves an arcology, a large inhabited structure, called Todos Santos, which rises above a crime- ridden Los Angeles, California, but has little beyond casual contact with the city. The novel popularized the phrase \\"think of it as evolution in action,\\" which occurs elsewhere in Niven's books. The novel anticipated the building of the Los Angeles Subway. It was included in David Pringle's book Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels. Plot summary In the near future, a race riot results in the destruction of an area just outside Los Angeles. The city sells the construction rights to a private company, which then constructs an arcology, named Todos Santos. The higher standard of living enjoyed by Todos Santos residents causes resentment among Angelenos. The arcology dwellers have evolved a different culture, sacrificing privacy - there are cameras (not routinely monitored) even in the private apartments - in exchange for security. The residents are fiercely loyal to the arcology and its management, and the loyalty runs both ways. During the course of the novel, Todos Santos is compared to a feudal society, with loyalty and obligations running both ways, hence the title of the novel. The systems at the arcology are run by MILLIE, an advanced computer system, and some high-level executives have direct links to MILLIE via bio-electronic implants in their brains. Other workers in the arcology work by telepresence, including one woman who remotely operates construction equipment on a lunar base. Todos Santos causes resentment among Angelenos, but has improved their lives as well. The company that owns the arcology tows icebergs in, solving the water shortage for all Southern Californians. Todos Santos has dug a Los Angeles subway using a digging machine, which uses an oxyhydrogen torch. Todos Santos is at the hub of the subway system, and contains a huge mall, which Angelenos may visit. This easy access causes Los Angeles' city officials to complain about the shopping dollars and tax revenues going outside the city limits. As the story opens, three young Angelenos sneak into the maintenance areas of Todos Santos. When they are detected by Todos Santos' security systems and personnel, they give every appearance of being terrorists, including spoofing the correct electronic access codes. When non-lethal means of stopping the three fail, Deputy Manager Preston Sanders orders lethal gas released rather than risk a bomb going off. Two of the intruders are killed. They turn out to be youths, with high tech equipment and boxes with such labels as \\"bomb\\", but without the actual means of harming the arcology. It soon turns out that they were duped by the \\"Friends of Man and the Earth\\" (FROMATE), anti-technology zealots who want to see Todos Santos destroyed or abandoned, as a means of forcing the arcology to turn off its lethal defenses for a later real attack. The deaths of the two youths cause political problems. Sanders is charged with murder. While arcology manager Art Bonner is quite prepared to defy the city authorities, Sanders turns himself in. The arcology is forced to turn off its lethal defenses as the FROMATEs planned. When that happens, they soon face a full-fledged attack by the FROMATEs, which they deter by non-lethal means, until the intruders prove they have deadly weapons, at which point Todos Santos security responds in kind, shooting and killing most of the intruders. While city authorities are still reacting to this, the arcology launches a jailbreak, the idea of chief engineer (and resident genius) Tony Rand. They tunnel under the jail using the tunneling machine that the \\"Saints\\" used to build the L.A. subway, release sleep gas into the jail, and free Sanders. Los Angeles soon retaliates with arrest and search warrants, but they are soon defeated by the sheer size of the arcology and the ability of the Todos Santos executives, aided in part by their direct links to MILLIE, to hide Rand and Sanders. After Todos Santos shows that it can cause Los Angeles trouble, such as by contaminating the Los Angeles water supply with salt water, and by work stoppages among the telepresence operators, a truce is arrived at: Rand and Sanders will leave the country permanently, and relations between Los Angeles and Todos Santos will be restored. In effect, Todos Santos has won, if only by restoring the status quo ante. Notable Quote: \\"Think of it as Evolution in Action\\" (Tony Rand) Reception It was chosen as one of the 100 best science fiction novels from 1949-1984, by critic David Pringle. It has been nominated numerous times for a Prometheus Award for best classic libertarian science fiction novel.  References  External references * Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle: Oath of Fealty.

Life and career He was born in Versailles and studied in Paris with Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Gustave Clarence Rodolphe Boulanger.Waller, S. (ed.), Foreign Artists and Communities in Modern Paris, 1870-1914: Strangers in Paradise, Routledge, 2017, p. 119. His themes are generally historical, and he treated them on a colossal scale and in an emotional naturalistic style, with a distinct revelling in horrible subjects and details. He made his Paris Salon d√©but in 1882 with Vitellis tra√Æn√© dans les rues de Rome par la populace (Vitellius dragged through the streets of Rome by the people) (1882; Sens). He followed this the year afterwards with Andromaque (1882‚Äì83; Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen), which won that year's prestigious Prix du Salon. There followed La Jacquerie (1885; Untraced), Le mort de Babylone (The fall of Babylon) (1891; Untraced), The death of the Emperor Geta (1899; Mus√©e de Picardie, Amiens), and Barbarian ambassadors at the Court of Justinian (1907; Untraced), all of which exemplify his strong and spirited but sensational and often brutal painting. In quite another style and beautiful in colour is his Le Chevalier aux Fleurs (The Knight of Flowers) (1894; Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, Paris; RF 898). He was elected an Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1892 and received the Medal of Honour in 1906 for The Red Delight. Rochegrosse also illustrated several books. Some of the drawings for these illustrations are in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, London. He lived his final years in Algeria, but returned to Paris where he died and is buried in Montparnasse Cemetery. His wife, Marie Rochegrosse (n√©e Leblond), had died in 1920.

Joe Quesada, who was Marvel's editor-in-chief during her first appearance, describes the character thus: \\"[Hill] is such a strong personality, she's like a force of nature and quite frankly, while perhaps not immediately loved by all involved, she's certainly as strong and imposing a figure as Nick Fury. Right now I feel that people view her as the outsider but [while] I don't think she's any harsher than Fury has ever been, what's different is that we aren't quite clear about her motives.\\"Quesada, Joe. \\"Joe Fridays\\".

The ballot is still used today. =Long-distance phone service= In 1991, the company launched long- distance phone service, promoting the fact that it would donate 1% of its customer charges to nonprofit groups. It also featured political actions in the customers' monthly bills, urging them to make free calls to elected officials. And it let customers pay for \\"CitizenLetters\\" to be sent in their name to the officials. By 1993, these actions included calling for a single- payer healthcare system and for allowing gays in the military. =Mobile phone service= The company started its mobile phone service as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) using the Sprint Nextel network in 2000. It also launched an activist website called Act for Change (now CREDO Action) in that same year. In 2016, the mobile phone service became a MVNO using the Verizon Wireless network, switching from the Sprint Nextel network. =Name change= In November 2007, Working Assets Wireless announced that it was changing its name to CREDO Mobile to better reflect the company's values: A belief that people, through donations to nonprofits and political activism, can effect progressive change. The names of its phone services were changed to CREDO mobile and CREDO Long Distance. However, its credit card is still called the Working Assets Credit Card. Its original mission of working for change remains unchanged. The company's website, the company states: =Environmental policy= In keeping with its commitment to protect the environment, the company offers free phone recycling, prints its bills on 100% post-consumer recycled paper, and offsets its electricity and shipping costs through Carbonfund.org's \\"carbon-free\\" program. CREDO plants 100 trees for every ton of paper it uses (enough to generate another ton) and it has donated more than $15 million to environmental groups in the US and abroad.http://www.credomobile.com/mission/green-policy In 2009, CREDO Mobile was recognized by the nonprofit Planning and Conservation League as the Environmental Business of the Year. Political activism CREDO Mobile's mission of social change takes the form of two primary activities: its donations to progressive nonprofits, and its CREDO Action activist arm. =Donations to nonprofit groups= Donations from its credit card, long- distance and mobile customers cumulatively total more than $80 million since 1985.https://www.credodonations.com/ In 2015, the company said that \\"CREDO and its members have raised over $3 million for Planned Parenthood, making us Planned Parenthood's largest corporate donor.\\" Other major recipients of donations include the ACLU, Doctors Without Borders, Rainforest Action Network, 350.org, and Amnesty International.http://www.credomobile.com/mission/donations Each year, the company selects dozens of nonprofit groups in five broad issue areas: civil rights, economic and social justice, environment, peace and international freedom, and voting rights and civic participation. And each year, the company asks its customers (\\"members\\" in the company's parlance) to vote on how to distribute the money it raises among the groups. One criticism of CREDO Mobile is that the organization only donates about 1% of each customer's bill. In 2018, CREDO Mobile donated $4000 to the initial Strong Arm Press crowdfunding drive. This press, a small imprint started in 2018 by The Intercept editor Ryan Grim and HuffPost editor Alex Lawson, placed CREDO's logo on the back cover of its first six books. =CREDO Action= Credo Mobile also has created an online network of more than 3 million activists who take actions both online and offline. On its website, the company states: During the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the company opposed it and worked with MoveOn.org and True Majority to take out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times against the US-led invasion. In 2004, it launched an \\"election protection\\" program and donated more than $1 million to groups working to register voters and increase turnout on Election Day. Credo Mobile has been a vocal opponent of both the Afghanistan War of 2001 and the Iraq War that began in 2003, and it mobilized against the invasions and later to push for withdrawal of US troops from both countries. This partly led in 2009 to Fast Company magazine including CREDO in its top five \\"brave brands\\". Among its environmental activism, the company has focused on moving away from fossil fuels and toward supporting renewable sources. As such, it has campaigned relentlessly against coal power, natural gas fracking, and more recently, against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. To increase voter turnout in the United States presidential election of 2008, CREDO Action started an initiative called Pollworkers for Democracy, which paid individuals to staff polling places and ensure fair voting practices. For their Text Out the Vote campaign, CREDO invited users to enter friends' phone numbers to text them each a reminder to vote on election day. Several U.S. states approved CREDO's online voter- registration tool. At CREDO's GoVote.org website, voters could look up their nearest polling place.SF Chronicle: CREDO relies on text messages to ensure progressive victory CREDO's political activism includes a wide range of issues ‚Äì from favoring marriage equality, women's rights, food safety and increased prosecution of fraud and crimes on Wall Street, to opposing corporate money in politics, especially in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC. One criticism of CREDO Action is that the organization has been accused of fearmongering. On January 7, 2020, CREDO Action announced on its website that it would shut down effective immediately, and that CREDO will no longer be engaging in activism campaigns. =CREDO SuperPAC= In 2012, the company launched the \\"CREDO SuperPAC\\", not to support candidates but to oppose them. Becky Bond, CREDO Mobile's Vice President and Political Director, served as President of the CREDO SuperPAC. Unlike other corporate superPACs, CREDO SuperPAC focused more on grassroots, volunteer-driven activism than on buying television advertisements. Its stated aim was to defeat candidates affiliated with the Tea Party movement, running for re- election to the US House of Representatives. Its campaign, dubbed \\"Take Down the Tea Party Ten\\", helped to defeat 5 of the candidates: Allen West, Frank Guinta, Joe Walsh, Chip Cravaack and Dan Lungren. In 2014, the CREDO SuperPAC planned to use the same grassroots, volunteer-driven activism to help candidates of the US Democratic Party in five Senate elections. By aiming to flip Republican-held seats in Georgia and Kentucky, while maintaining Democratic-held seats in Michigan, Colorado and North Carolina, CREDO hoped to \\"save the Senate\\" from a Republican takeover. Influence Another company, Patriot Mobile, was begun in part to provide a conservative alternative to Credo.

Mitchell finds a girlfriend Kiki (Melody Klaver). Mitchell is bullied by Lucien. As a teacher in a sports school he teaches his students also matters like talking about things bothering you; however, himself he communicates very poorly with Mitchell. Mitchell provocatively shows up dancing in a ballet tutu on his birthday party. Lucien freaks out and injures Mitchell. Mitchell goes in the tutu on his bike to some friends. They are not shocked about his tutu, they just wonder \\"Does your father know that nowadays you walk around like that?\\". Lucien starts living in his sports school. The film ends with a beginning of reconciliation: also they still hardly talk to each other, at least they drink coffee together. Apart from the friction between Lucien and Mitchell the film shows a very friendly multicultural community.

It was introduced in February 1997 alongside the Power Macintosh 7300 and 8600, and replaced the Power Macintosh 9500 as Apple's flagship desktop computer. The 9600 was replaced by the Power Macintosh G3 Mini Tower in Apple's product lineup in November 1997, with sales of the 9600 continuing until March 1998.  Models  When introduced, the Power Macintosh 9600 was available with three processor configurations: single-processor , dual-processor , and single- processor . The line was updated in August 1997 with a single-processor or \\"Mach 5\\" 604ev with a larger L2 cache, priced at $4,500 and $5,300, respectively. An updated Workgroup Server 9650 was introduced at the same time with a 350 MHz CPU, and could be ordered pre-configured as an application server, AppleShare server or Internet server, with prices ranging from $6,800 to $7,500 USD depending on the software package chosen. The model was initially discontinued in October due to CPU supply problems, but reintroduced on February 17, 1998 when the was discontinued in favor of the new Power Macintosh G3 Mini Tower. While the G3 was faster, its expandability was only on par with the 8600, so the 9600 was kept available until March for users that required it.  Hardware  Power Macintosh 9600 logic board The 9600 came in the same new case as the 8600, but was internally very similar to the 9500 that preceded it, with 12 RAM slots and 6 PCI slots instead of the 8 RAM and 3 PCI slots on the 8600. The 9600 used the new PowerPC 604e CPU, an enhanced version of the 9500 604. IMS IXMICRO TwinTurbo 128 video card Like its predecessor, the Power Macintosh 9600 has no built-in video; instead, it shipped with an 8MB IXMICRO TwinTurbo 128-bit PCI video card installed. The Power Macintosh 9600/350 was the most powerful Mac ever in Apple's four-digit model numbering system, the last multiprocessor Mac for three years, and the last model with six or more expansion slots until the 2019 Mac Pro. No version of OS X was officially supported by Apple on the 9600; its installation and use required the use of the third-party software solution XPostFacto. Mac OS X 10.3 or 10.4 was only possible with a G3 processor upgrade installed, and OS X 10.5 was possible with a G4 upgrade. The 9600 was part of the final generation of Macs to ship with a SCSI hard drive as a standard feature; subsequent Macs adopted IDE for the internal hard drive bus.

The station is along Tverskaya Street under Pushkin Square in Moscow. From its opening in 1979 until 1990, it was named Gorkovskaya, which was the name of Tverskaya Street during the Soviet times. After the government restored the Tverskaya name in 1990, he station's name was changed accordingly. The station was originally planned to open in 1938 along with the rest of the Gorkovsky radius of the second stage of the Metro. However this was abandoned and a provision of a straight tunnel, with a reinforced structure was left. However upon the change in the Metro development plans in the early 1960s, the city included a transfer station on the line. As a result, in 1975, after the opening of station, construction on Tverskaya began. The design marked a real engineering achievement, as the central hall, and the passenger platforms were built without any disruption to the service. Design The decoration is dedicated to the works of the author, and architects R. Semerdzhiev, B. Thor, N. Shreter and V. Cheremin made best to simultaneously show the revolutionary constructivism shapes of flared pylons and plastered ceiling thus leaving the engineering achievement visible. White marble was used for pylons and walls and red granite for the floor. Originally the end of the station was decorated with a sculptural composition dedicated to the theme of his works. However, in 1987 after the opening of a transfer with Chekhovskaya, the composition was moved to the escalator lobby in the transfer. Transfer to Pushkinskaya is achieved through the two underplatform passageways, and via the vestibule under the Pushkin square which they share. 2000 Bomb Attack In August 2000, a homemade bomb was detonated in the walkway leading to Pushkin Square. Seven victims were killed at the scene and six others died in hospitals. The explosion injured 118 others.

Retrieved 7 April 2009. http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/foner-obit.html In 1979, the New York State Board of Education officially apologized to Foner and other teachers and staff who were fired and whose lives were disrupted by the activities of the Rapp-Coudert Committee, which it described as having egregiously violated academic freedom. He was the twin brother of historian Philip S. Foner and the father of historian Eric Foner. Early life and education Jack Foner was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1910 to Jewish parents who had immigrated from the Russian empire. He was one of four brothers: his twin brother, Philip Foner, would later become a Marxist labor historian and political activist, while their younger brothers Henry Foner and Moe Foner would both become labor union organizers. Jack Foner attended Eastern District High School and graduated from City College of New York in 1929. He and Philip both studied under historian Allan Nevins there.Lawrence Van Gelder, \\"Philip S. Foner, Labor Historian and Professor, 84.\\", New York Times, December 15, 1994, pg. B20. Foner earned a master's degree in 1933 and a doctorate in 1967 in American history, both from Columbia University. Early career Jack Foner taught history in 1935 at Baruch College (then called the downtown branch of the City College of New York). He actively supported the Spanish Republic against fascism, and stood for the rights of African Americans. Blacklisting In 1941, Foner was forced out of his teaching job, along with 60 other faculty members, in the wake of an investigation of alleged communist influences in higher education by the New York state legislature's anti-communist Rapp-Coudert Committee. It was officially known as the \\"Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate the Educational System of the State of New York. One of the complaints against Jack Foner was that his teaching devoted excessive attention to the role of African Americans in history. He declined to testify before the commission and was blacklisted, which meant that he was unable to obtain academic employment for almost three decades. In 1979, the New York State Board of Higher Education apologized to Foner and others who were investigated and lost jobs due to the activities of the Rapp-Coudert Committee. It described the events of 1941 \\"an egregious violation of academic freedom.\\"American Historical Association In 1993, Foner told Colby magazine that he considered the episode to be an \\"honorable experience.\\" He said, \\"there was really no evidence to support it,\\" referring to his being fired and blacklisted.Colby College Magazine, Spring 2000 Later years From 1942 to 1945, during World War II, Foner served in the United States Army. Because of his age, he was stationed in the United States. His assignments were menial. After the war, Foner supported his family by doing freelance lecturing. He and his three brothers also had a swing music band, in which he played drums, known as the \\"Foner Orchestra\\". The group played at resorts in the Catskills. Foner also worked with Paul Robeson and Harry Belafonte, and maintained a friendship with W. E. B. Du Bois, all of whom similarly suffered blacklisting. Subsequent academic career Colby College in Waterville, Maine hired Foner in the spring of 1969 to teach history. He taught there from 1969 to 1976, establishing one of the first black studies programs in the nation. After retiring from Colby, he returned as a visiting scholar in 1983 and 1985. His best-known book is Blacks and the Military in American History (1974). Foner returned to New York City to live. He died in Manhattan in 1999. Legacy and honors *1982, Colby College awarded him an honorary doctorate. Personal life Foner and his wife, Liza, were married for 57 years and lived mostly in New York City. They had two children, Eric Foner and Thomas Foner. Eric Foner has become recognized for his work in Civil War, Reconstruction and African-American history and is a professor of history at Columbia University. Thomas died in 1999, the same year as his father. See also * Morris U.

It was voted to be the 21st worst video game of all time according to FLUX magazine though it was also voted best-underrated gem game by 6y magazine. Summary Armed with a knife, Jonathan Harker has to fight one of Dracula's minions. While based on the 1992 film of the same name, the game had very little to do with the actual movie. Several weapons can be used; ranging from the basic knife to the advanced shotgun weapon. The 16-bit renditions of the game were straightforward hack and slash games where players had to slash generic enemies in order to get to Dracula. There is a time limit that forces players to move quickly around the levels. Each chapter of the game starts off with a cover from a book. Checkpoints are used to maintain progress in a level after losing a life. Each level has a daytime and nighttime equivalent. A boss appears at the end of each night time level in order to test the playing skills and to reinforce the concepts that were taught in the daytime version of the level. The player controls a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker. Harker must free himself from Dracula's capture, follow him to London, and end his reign of terror.

Based on Dr. Wong and Dr. O'Neill's UC Berkeley research, the company received startup funding of $1.8M from an Advanced Technology Program (ATP) grant to conduct research and development on pit depth modulated optical data storage systems. Over the years, Calimetrics raised approximately $50M from government, venture, angel, and corporate sources. Calimetrics was acquired in 2003 by LSI Logic and ceased operations in 2004. Technology Pit depth modulation, which the company later branded MultiLevel Recording (ML), is one of many techniques to increase recording densities on conventional CD-optical media. Calimetrics' implementation of pit depth modulation, using modified CD drive electronics but no changes to the pickup- head, increased the quantity of distinguishable recording-marks from 2-levels (used by EFM in CD) to 8 levels. The increase in bit-density had a side benefit of increasing data-transfer rate (at the same rotational-velocity of the disc.) MultiLevel, like most of the other strategies proposed for extending CD capacity, was not backward compatible with CD-ROM technology: 2GB ML R, RW, and ROM disc playing and recording required ML-capable writers and special ML-CD compatible media. However, the cost to build CD rewriters with both ML and CD support was less than that of DVD-recordable technology. Calimetrics's commercialization partners included Iomega, Texas Instruments, TDK, Mitsubishi Chemical, Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics (Panasonic), Sanyo Electric, and Shinano Kenshi (Plextor). History In 2001, Calimetrics demonstrated hardware prototypes for a 2GB ML-CD reader/writer, using blank- media that was very similar to CD. By the time the ML-CD system was ready to enter consumer production (late 2001), CD-R/RW drives had dropped significantly in price due to the entry of Taiwanese producers and industry backing behind the various DVD recordable formats had become significant. In addition, the illfated Sony double-density CD format (DDCD) had already come and gone without any lasting impact on the market. This left ML-CD, another offshoot of the CD, with an uncertain outlook. Suffice it to say, without a launch commitment from drive and blank-media industry, ML-CD drives never reached the consumer-market. When the company was acquired by LSI Logic in 2003, it had already begun work on ML-DVD. Like ML-CD, ML-DVD required new drive electronics and special ML media, but no change to the optical pickup- head. In terms of capacity, both ML-DVD-R (recordable) and ML-DVD-ROM discs were specified at 16GB for dual-layer, and 8GB for single-layer. Rewritable media (ML-DVD-RW) offered 8GB (single-layer.) Because of the shared physical characteristics with DVD-ROM pickups, the ML controller-chip was anticipated as a drop-in replacement for existing DVD-drives, greatly reducing cost of ML- DVD capable drives. This time, Calimetrics faced competition from both above and below. From above, there were the two blue-laser formats - the Philips/Sony backed Blu-ray, and the Toshiba/NEC Advanced Optical Disc (AOD.) Both blue-laser formats were more costly, but offered greater storage (and industry backing.) From below, Taiwan's home-grown DVD-spinoff (called FVD: Forward Versatile Disc) offered less capacity than ML-DVD, but enjoyed the backing of Taiwan's governmental research agency as well as Taiwan's semiconductor industry. The DVD Forum later approved the AOD proposal, which was officially in 2006 as the HD DVD format. The Blu-ray Consortium quickly followed and released their own players and movie titles to compete head-to- head against HD DVD. Meanwhile, China, the consumer market most likely to accept ML-DVD for domestic-use, instead chose Taiwan's FVD. Faced with dwindling opportunities to launch ML-DVD, LSI suspended research and development on MultiLevel Recording.

The ADMLC's main aim is to review current understanding of atmospheric dispersion and related phenomena for application primarily in the authorization or licensing of pollutant emissions to the atmosphere from industrial, commercial or institutional sites. The ADMLC is primarily concerned with atmospheric pollutant discharges from regulated emission sites and other fixed sources. Their review and study interests include routine discharges as well as accidental releases or releases cause by operational upsets. Their interests also include modelling dispersion at all scales from on-site short range (including dispersion modelling indoors) to long range distances. The ADMLC does not normally get involved with pollutant emissions from roadway traffic or other non-fixed sources. Nor does it get involved with air pollution topics such as acid rain and ozone formation. History In 1977, a meeting of representatives from UK government departments, utilities and research organisations was held to discuss atmospheric dispersion calculation methods for radioactive releases. Those present agreed on the need for a review of recent developments in atmospheric dispersion modelling and formed an informal Steering Committee, which operated for a number of years. That Steering Committee subsequently became the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling Liaison Committee in 1995. Although the ADMLC was initially formed to consider primarily radioactive releases from the nuclear industry, it has expanded its range of interests and its membership to more fully reflect the needs of industrial and regulatory organisations. Membership As listed on the ADMLC's web site, the membership of the ADMLC includes the following entities: *Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston *Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) *Department for Energy and Climate Change *Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) *Environment Agency *Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland) *Food Standards Agency *Health and Safety Executive **Methodology and Standards Development Unit, Hazardous Installations Directorate **Nuclear Installations Inspectorate *Health and Safety Laboratory *Home Office *Met Office *Amec Foster Wheeler * Nuclear Department, HMS Sultan *Public Health England *Scottish Environment Protection Agency The Chairman of ADMLC is provided by the Met Office and the Secretariat of the ADMLC are provided by Public Health England. Areas of interest ADMLC facilitates the exchange of ideas and highlights where there are gaps in knowledge. It tries to provide guidance to, and to endorse good practice in, the dispersion modelling community. The ADMLC has hosted workshops and welcomes ideas for joint meetings or joint workshops with other organisations. The ADMLC members pay an annual subscription which is used to fund reviews on topics agreed on by the members. Reviews already funded by ADMLC include: * Dispersion at low wind speed * Dispersion from sources near groups of buildings, or in urban areas * Plume rise * Dispersion in coastal areas, * The use of old meteorological data or data obtained at some distance from the release point * The possible use of data from numerical weather prediction programs * Uncertainty of dispersion model predictions as a result of deriving atmospheric stability indicators from meteorological data * Proceedings of a workshop on the reliability of dispersion models for regulatory applications * Review of the Royal Meteorological Society guidelines for atmospheric dispersion modelling * Calculation of air pollutant concentrations indoors * Dispersion following explosions A complete list of projects, and links to each report, can be found on the ADMLC website.

A total of 46 episodes were made, 18 in monochrome (black & white) and 28 in colour. The series, produced by Granada Television for the ITV network, starred Hylda Baker and Jimmy Jewel as squabbling middle-aged siblings Nellie and Eli Pledge who ran a family pickle business in Colne, Lancashire, in the North West of England. Series premise and history The first episode set up the premise: in his will, Joshua Pledge bequeathed a large sum of money to his middle-aged son and daughter... but only if they stay together for five years at his small pickle business, Pledge's Purer Pickles. However, hard-working spinster Nellie and her ne'er-do-well womanising brother Eli, rarely saw eye to eye. Nellie was played by comedian Hylda Baker, who was born and bred in Farnworth, eleven miles north of Manchester. Eli was played by Jimmy Jewel, a Yorkshire-born contemporary of Baker; he had made his name with Ben Warriss in the music hall (vaudeville) act Jewel and Warriss. Also featured was the Pledges' second-cousin, Lily Tattersall, who was married to constantly-mute octogenarian Walter. Walter was unable to control his bladder, which led to one of the programme's oft-used catchphrases, \\"Has he been?\\". Lily was played by Madge Hindle, Walter by Edward Malin. Another regular character was the Pledges' toothless, cloth-capped old foreman, Stan Hardman (Joe Gladwin). Much of the comedy was derived from Nellie's constant malapropisms. When asked by Lily if she knew the facts of life, Nellie replied with immense dignity, \\"Of course I do! I'm well over the age of content!\\" In another episode, Nellie has a suitor named Vernon Smallpiece, whom she addresses as 'Vermin Bigpiece'. When Eli insists on playing the high-powered executive once he is in charge of the pickle business, Nellie asks him who he thinks he is \\"sat sitting there like a big business typhoon!\\" In each episode, Nellie and Eli would hurl insults at each other to spectacular effect, as they fought over the family business or domestic matters, with Nellie's constant nagging and Eli's constant drinking and womanising fuelling their arguments. It was known that the insults continued off-screen as well, as Baker and Jewel disliked each other in real life. In later episodes, Baker struggled to remember her lines and relied on cue cards and prompting from co-star Madge Hindle. Baker would suffer greatly with dementia during her final years. The third series, transmitted in October and November 1969, was the first to be recorded in colour, but given that ITV began broadcasting in colour from 15 November 1969, most viewers would have seen these in black-and-white on their first run. An industrial dispute at ITV in 1971, known as the Colour Strike, led to seven of the eight programmes from the fifth series being made in black-and-white.

In 1973, the series was adapted for the American market. Renamed Thicker Than Water, it starred Julie Harris and Richard Long as squabbling siblings Nellie and Ernie Paine, however, the US version was not successful and was cancelled after only 13 episodes. After Nearest and Dearest After the series ended in 1973, Baker went on to star in the sitcom Not On Your Nellie (made for ITV by London Weekend Television) in which Lancashire-born Nellie Pickersgill (the same character as Nellie Pledge in all but name) travels to London to run her ailing father's pub, the Brown Cow. In a 1973 interview with Baker and Jewel (available on the seventh-series DVD of Nearest & Dearest), Baker stated that the forthcoming Not on Your Nellie series was actually a spinoff from Nearest and Dearest and would follow Nellie's exploits in London after Eli practically deserts her. This would appear to follow on from the final episode of Nearest and Dearest in which Stan informed Nellie and Eli that there was an explosion at the pickling shed, implying that Pledge's Purer Pickles was now defunct. However, possibly due to an issue over legal rights regarding the Nellie Pledge character, Not on Your Nellie was ultimately made as an \\"original\\" new series rather than a spinoff, despite the obvious similarities between the two. Meanwhile, Jewel went on to appear in the sitcom Spring and Autumn (1973‚Äì1976), about a friendship between a lonely boy and an elderly man, created by Nearest and Dearest creators Vince Powell and Harry Driver. Jewel continued to work in television for many years, and in 1991 he appeared in an episode of the BBC hospital drama series Casualty in which he was able to use one of his famous catchphrases, referring to a nurse as \\"a knock-kneed, knackered old nose bag\\" ‚Äì a term he had regularly bestowed upon Nellie. Harry Driver, who created and wrote many episodes of the series with Vince Powell, died on 25 November 1973, just nine months after the series ended, aged only 42‚Äîmarking the abrupt end of a successful 13-year writing partnership with Powell. Edward Malin, who played Walter, was the first of the cast to die, on 1 March 1977, four years after the show ended. Hylda Baker spent her final years penniless and battling dementia, and died in a retirement home on 1 May 1986 of bronchial pneumonia, aged 81. Joe Gladwin, who played Stan, went on to other television roles, including Wally Batty in the long-running sitcom Last of the Summer Wine, a role he played until his death on 11 March 1987. Jewel continued to work in a variety of roles in both theatre and television until his death on 3 December 1995, the day before his 86th birthday. Co-creator Vince Powell died on 13 July 2009, aged 80. Madge Hindle, the sole surviving member of the cast, went on to become a series regular in Coronation Street from 1976 to 1980, playing Renee Roberts, the wife of grocer Alf Roberts. Since then Hindle has worked in a variety of roles in television and stage. DVD releases All seven series of Nearest And Dearest (in separate editions and also a 7-disc box set) have been released on DVD by Network. The 1972 film has also been released on DVD by DD Video.

It is the seat of the Catholic Bishopric of Kotor which covers the entire gulf.Katedrala Svetog Tripuna, TO Kotor Location and name It is located in the city of Kotor, one of the best preserved and most beautiful medieval fortified towns in the Mediterranean. It was built in honor of Saint Tryphon (local name Sveti Tripun), the patron and protector of the city, on the same site where an older church had already existed long ago. That earlier church was built in 809 by Andrija (Andreaccio) Saracenis, a citizen of Kotor, where the remains of the saint were kept after being brought from Constantinople (now also known as Istanbul).Stari Grad Kotor, waytomonte.com History Croatian King Tomislav's memorial plaque at Cathedral of Saint Tryphon The cathedral was consecrated on 19 June 1166. Compared to other buildings, the Kotor Cathedral is one of the largest and most ornate buildings in Kotor. The cathedral was seriously damaged and rebuilt after the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake, but there were not enough funds for its complete reconstruction. The April 1979 Montenegro earthquake, which completely devastated the Montenegro coast, also greatly damaged the cathedral. It has been salvaged and the careful restoration of parts of its interior has not been completed until a few years ago. The Romanesque architecture, contains a rich collection of artifacts. Older than many famous churches and cathedrals in Europe, the cathedral has a treasury of immense value. In its interior there are frescoes from the 14th century, a stone ornament above the main altar in which the life of St Tryphon is depicted, as well as a relief of saints in gold and silver. The collection of art objects includes a silver hand and a cross, decorated with ornaments and figures in relief. It is only a part of the valuable objects of the Treasury of this unique sacral building which was the City Hall in the past. Today, it is the best known tourist attraction in Kotor and a symbol of the city: the Saint is depicted in the city's coat of arms, along with a lion and the Mount of San Giovanni.

He lived extravagantly, and was nicknamed the \\"Macaroni Parson\\". He dabbled in forgery in an effort to clear his debts, and was caught and convicted. Despite a public campaign for a Royal pardon, in which he received the assistance of Samuel Johnson, he was hanged at Tyburn for forgery. Biography =Early life= Dodd was born in Bourne in Lincolnshire, the son of the local vicar. He attended Clare Hall in the University of Cambridge from 1745 to 1750, where he achieved academic success and graduated as a wrangler. He then moved to London, where his spendthrift habits soon left him in debt. He married impulsively on 15 April 1751, to Mary Perkins, daughter of a domestic servant, leaving his finances in an even more precarious position. =Priesthood= At the urging of his concerned father, he decided to take holy orders, and was ordained a deacon in 1751 and a priest in 1753, serving as a curate in a church in West Ham, then as a preacher at St James Garlickhythe, and then at St Olave Hart Street. He became a popular and fashionable preacher, and was appointed as a chaplain in ordinary to the King in 1763. He became a prebend in Brecon, and was a tutor to Philip Stanhope, later 5th Earl of Chesterfield. He became chaplain to the King, and became a Doctor of Laws at Cambridge University in 1766. After he won ¬£1,000 in a lottery, he became involved in schemes to build the Charlotte Chapel in Pimlico, and bought a share of the Charlotte Chapel in Bloomsbury. Despite his profession, he continued his extravagant lifestyle, and became known as the \\"macaroni parson\\". In 1772, he became rector of Hockliffe, in Bedfordshire, and vicar of Chalgrave.The Newgate Calendar, ed. by Andrew Knapp & William Baldwin, 4 vols. (London: J. Robins, 1828), 3: 50-62 =Bribery= In 1774, in an attempt to rectify his depleted finances, he attempted to obtain the lucrative position of rector of St George's, Hanover Square. He caused an anonymous letter to be sent to Lady Apsley, wife of the Lord Chancellor, offering her ¬£3,000 to secure the position. The letter was traced back to Dodd, and he was dismissed from his existing posts. He became an object of public ridicule, and was taunted as Dr Simony in a play by Samuel Foote in the Haymarket Theatre. He spent two years abroad, in Geneva and France, until the scandal subsided. He returned to England in 1776. In The Luck of Barry Lyndon Thackeray has his protagonist refer to meeting \\"Dr Simony\\" in Soho and to a friendship with Foote. =Forgery and execution= In February 1777, he forged a bond for ¬£4,200 in the name of his former pupil, the Earl of Chesterfield, to clear his debts. A banker accepted the bond in good faith, and lent him money on the strength of it. Later the banker noticed a small blot in the text and had the document re-written. When the clean copy was presented to the Earl to sign, in order to replace the old one, the forgery was discovered. Dodd immediately confessed, and begged time to make amends. He was, however, imprisoned in the Wood Street Compter pending trial. He was convicted, and sentenced to death. Samuel Johnson wrote several papers in his defence, and some 23,000 people signed a 37-page petition seeking a pardon. Nevertheless, Dodd was publicly hanged at Tyburn on 27 June 1777. =Published works= He wrote several published works, including poems, a novel, and theological tracts. His most successful work was The Beauties of Shakespeare (1752). He also wrote a Commentary on the Bible (1765‚Äì1770), and composed the blank verse Thoughts in Prison while in Newgate Prison between his conviction and execution. =\\"It concentrates his mind wonderfully\\"= Dodd's sermon The Convict's Address to his unhappy Brethren was largely written by Samuel Johnson to be used as Dodd's own. When one of Johnson's friends doubted the authorship, Johnson, in order to protect Dodd, made his famous remark \\"Depend upon it Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully\\". James Boswell gives Johnson's explanation of the circumstances in his Life of Samuel Johnson: > Johnson disapproved of Dr. Dodd's leaving the world persuaded that The > Convict's Address to his unhappy Brethren was of his own writing. 'But, Sir, > (said I,) you contributed to the deception; for when Mr. Seward expressed a > doubt to you that it was not Dodd's own, because it had a great deal more > force of mind in it than any thing known to be his, you answered, --\\"Why > should you think so? Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be > hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\\"' JOHNSON. Sir, > as Dodd got it from me to pass as his own, while that could do him any good, > there was an IMPLIED PROMISE that I should not own it. To own it, therefore, > would have been telling a lie, with the addition of breach of promise, which > was worse than simply telling a lie to make it be believed it was Dodd's. > Besides, Sir, I did not DIRECTLY tell a lie: I left the matter uncertain. > Perhaps I thought that Seward would not believe it the less to be mine for > what I said; but I would not put it in his power to say I had owned it.'

Career The son of a comedian and actor who also used the stage name Jimmy Jewel, the younger performer made his stage debut in Robinson Crusoe in Barnsley, at the age of four, worked with his father from the age of 10 and subsequently became stage manager for the family show. When young Jimmy started his own act, his father refused to let him use his stage name 'Jimmy Jewel', so he performed as Maurice Marsh; the name was chosen because he was often seen doing Maurice Chevalier impressions. He made his first London stage appearance at the Bedford Music Hall, Camden Town in 1925. =Jewel and Warriss= Jewel and Ben Warriss were first cousins and were brought up in the same household, even being born in the same bed (a few months apart). Jewel worked as a solo act until 1934, when he formed an enduring double act with Warriss, initially at the Palace Theatre, Newcastle.Gifford, Dennis: Obituary: Ben Warriss The Independent, 18 January 1993.

He came from a humble background, but became prominent after leading a rebellion in 404 to overthrow Huan Xuan, who had usurped the Jin throne in 403. After that point, using a mixture of political and military skills, Liu Yu gradually concentrated power in his own hands while expanding Jin's territory. In 420, he forced Emperor Gong of Jin to yield the throne to him, thus ending Jin and establishing Song. He ruled only briefly, for two years, before dying and passing the throne to his son, Emperor Shao of Liu Song. The History of the Southern Dynasties described Liu Yu as seven chi and six cun tall (approximately 186.2 cm).  Early life  Liu Yu was born in 363, to his father Liu Qiao () and mother Zhao Anzong (), while they were living at Jingkou (‰∫¨Âè£, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). His great grandfather Liu Hun () was originally from Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), before moving to Jingkou.Book of Song, chp. 1 (The Chronicle of Emperor Wu, Part 1). Liu Qiao was said to be a 20th generation descendant of Han Dynasty's Prince of Chu, Liu Jiao (), a younger brother of Han's founder Emperor Gaozu of Han.Book of Song, vol. 1 Liu Qiao was a police officer, while Zhao Anzong was the daughter of a commandery governor. They had married in 360, and lived in fair poverty. Lady Zhao died immediately after giving birth to Liu Yu, and Liu Qiao, unable to take care of the child financially or otherwise, considered abandoning the child. Upon hearing this, Liu Yu's aunt, who had given birth to his cousin Liu Huaijing () less than a year ago, went to Liu Qiao's house and took Liu Yu, weaning Liu Huaijing and giving her milk to Liu Yu instead. At some point, Liu Qiao remarried, and his new wife Xiao Wenshou bore him two sons, Liu Daolian () and Liu Daogui (). Liu Yu was said to be respectful to his stepmother and treated her as his own mother. It is not known when Liu Qiao died, but in any case, Liu Yu grew up with great ambitions and was said to be strong and brave, but he was poor and uneducated, knowing only a few characters. He maintained himself by selling straw sandals, and he liked gambling. The people in his village all looked down on him. At some point, he became an officer under the general Sun Wuzhong (). When the magician Sun En rebelled against Jin rule in 399, Liu Yu joined the army of the general Liu Laozhi (), and he became friends with Liu Laozhi's son Liu Jingxuan (). On one occasion, he led some tens of soldiers on a scouting mission, when they suddenly encountered several thousand of Sun's soldiers. All of Liu Yu's soldiers were killed, and Liu Yu fell onto a riverbank, but he stood his position there and killed all of Sun's soldiers who dared to approach. Liu Jingxuan, meanwhile, realizing that Liu Yu had been away from camp for too long, went to try to find him, and saw him alone trying to hold off Sun's soldiers. He greatly praised Liu Yu. Both because of his bravery and his friendship with Liu Jingxuan, Liu Yu rose through the ranks of Liu Laozhi's army. Liu Laozhi, at the time, was a powerful warlord who controlled modern Jiangsu and Zhejiang except for the region around the capital Jiankang. In 401, with Sun En, who had fled to Zhoushan Island in late 399, trying to launch a comeback and attacking Haiyan (Êµ∑ÈπΩ, in modern Jiaxing, Zhejiang), Liu Yu fought him, winning several victories over him despite being outnumbered. However, eventually Sun En was able to regroup and head toward Jiankang, which he could not capture and was forced to withdraw from. He regrouped on a sea island. By imperial edict (probably at Liu Laozhi's wishes), Liu Yu was made the governor of Xiapei Commandery (‰∏ãÈÇ≥, roughly modern eastern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), and he was ordered to attack Sun En on his island, winning victories over him. Sun En began to grow weaker and headed south on the coast, with Liu Yu following. In winter 401, Liu Yu defeated Sun En again at Haiyan, forcing Sun to flee far from the coast. In 402, as the regent Sima Yuanxian and the warlord Huan Xuan prepared to battle, Sima Yuanxian believed that he had Liu Laozhi's support, and Liu Laozhi postured in support of Sima Yuanxian by bringing his forces to Jiankang. However, when Liu Yu requested to engage Huan Xuan, Liu Laozhi refused to give permission. Huan Xuan then sent messengers to try to persuade Liu Laozhi to switch sides, despite the oppositions of his nephew He Wuji () and Liu Jingxuan, as well as Liu Yu. Without support from Liu Laozhi, Sima Yuanxian's forces collapsed in face of Huan Xuan's attack, and Sima Yuanxian and his father Sima Daozi were killed by Huan Xuan. Huan Xuan, who did not trust Liu Laozhi, immediately stripped Liu Laozhi of his military command, and Liu Laozhi, upon receiving the order, considered resisting it. He requested Liu Yu's opinion, and Liu Yu found the idea foolish, left Liu Laozhi's army, and returned to Jingkou as a civilian; He Wuji joined him as well. With the rest of the army not willing to go with his plan either, Liu Laozhi committed suicide, and Liu Jingxuan fled to Later Qin and then to Southern Yan. By summer 402, however, Liu Yu was again in the army, and by 403 he carried a general rank, when Sun En's nephew Lu Xun (), who succeeded him after his death in battle in 401, attacked Dongyang (Êù±ÈôΩ, in modern Jinhua, Zhejiang), and Liu Yu repelled Lu's attack. He then counterattacked and won several battles over Lu, forcing Lu to head south on the sea. At this time, He Wuji tried to persuade him to declare a rebellion at Shanyin (Â±±Èô∞, in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) against Huan Xuan, but at the advice of Kong Jing (), he declined at this time, waiting for Huan Xuan to seize the throne so that he would have a reason to. When Huan Xuan's cousin Huan Qian () asked Liu Yu's opinion on whether Huan Xuan should receive the throne, Liu Yu pretended to be a Huan clan loyalist and encouraged Huan Xuan to receive the throne. In winter 403, Huan Xuan forced Emperor An of Jin to yield the throne to him, establishing the new state of Chu. Liu Yu initially continued to feign loyalty, and Huan Xuan, believing in him and his talents, considered giving him greater authorities, despite counsel from his wife Empress Liu that Liu Yu could not be trusted and should be executed.  Campaign against Huan Xuan  Meanwhile, Liu Yu and He Wuji, now at Jingkou, continued their planning to rebel against Huan Xuan now that Huan Xuan had seized the throne. They were soon joined in their plans by Liu Yi () and Meng Chang (), and soon a number of other disaffected individuals joined their plan, with Liu Yu as the leader. Their plan was to simultaneously start several uprisings: * Liu Yi, Liu Yu's brother Liu Daogui, and Meng would surprise and kill Huan Xuan's cousin Huan Hong (), then the governor of Qing Province (ÈùíÂ∑û, then with its headquarters at Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu)), and seize Guangling. * Zhuge Zhangmin () would surprise and kill Diao Kui (), the governor of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑û, then modern central Anhui) and seize Liyang (Ê≠∑ÈôΩ, in modern Chaohu, Anhui). * Wang Yuande (), Xin Huxing (), and Dong Houzhi () would rise in Jiankang and attack Huan Xuan directly. * Liu Yu, He Wuji, and the other conspirators would surprise and kill Huan Xuan's cousin Huan Xiu () the Prince of Ancheng, then the governor of Xu () and Yan () Provinces, then with their headquarters at Jingkou, and seize Jingkou. The conspirators put their plans into action. Liu Yu and He Wuji were able to surprise Huan Xiu and seize Jingkou, and Liu Yu then persuaded the capable administrator and writer Liu Muzhi () to join him as his propaganda specialist and assistant. Liu Yi, Liu Daogui, and Meng Chang persuaded Huan Hong to go on a hunt, and as Huan Hong opened the city gates to let his hunters out, they surprised him and killed him. However, Zhuge Zhangmin's plans were leaked, as were those of the conspirators at Jiankang. All were arrested, and the conspirators at Jiankang were executed. (Zhuge Zhangmin was subsequently rescued before he could be executed.) Liu Yu quickly headed for Jiankang, and Huan Xuan, hesitant to engage him directly, waited at Jiankang, trying to see if he could wear Liu Yu down, although, at Huan Qian's insistence, he sent a detachment to try to stop Liu Yu. However, Liu Yu quickly defeated Huan Xuan's generals Wu Fuzhi () and Huangfu Fu () and arrived at Jiankang. He then defeated Huan Qian, and Huan Xuan, in panic, fled west, intending to go back to his power base at Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). Liu Yu entered Jiankang and declared the reestablishment of Jin, even though at this time Emperor An and his brother Sima Dewen were both still in Huan Xuan's control. Liu Yu entrusted most administrative matters to Liu Muzhi while dealing severe punishment to corrupt officials and those who had supported Huan Xuan, and quickly the government was cleaned up. (The only Huan Xuan supporter who was spared was Huan Xuan's prime minister Wang Mi (), who, when Liu Yu was poor, had helped him and paid off his gambling debts, and therefore Liu Yu not only spared but entrusted him with high posts.) Liu Yu, however, prepared for the contingency that Emperor An would not be recovered by making Sima Zun () the Prince of Wuling (a grandson of Emperor An's great-grandfather Emperor Yuan) acting emperor. Liu Yu sent Liu Yi, He Wuji, and Liu Daogui west to attack Huan Xuan. They quickly defeated Huan Xuan's general He Danzhi () and took Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi and Fujian), and then continued to head toward Jiangling. They encountered Huan Xuan's much larger force at Chenghong Island (), in modern Ezhou, Hubei), and despite the numerical disadvantage, they crushed Huan Xuan's forces. Huan Xuan fled back to Jiangling with Emperor An, while Huan Xuan's brother-in-law Yin Zhongwen () turned against him and took Emperor An's wife Empress Wang Shen'ai and Emperor Mu's wife Empress Dowager He to Jiankang. Once Huan Xuan arrived back in Jiangling, he tried to prepare to flee to his distant relative, Huan Xi () the governor of Liang Province (Ê¢ÅÂ∑û, modern southern Shaanxi and northwestern Hubei). His forces collapsed, however, refusing to follow his orders. At the inducement of his subordinate Mao Xiuzhi (), whose uncle Mao Qu () was the governor of Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing), he decided to try to flee to Yi Province instead, but on the way, he was intercepted by Mao Qu's subordinates Mao Youzhi () and Fei Tian (), who attacked him, and the officer Feng Qian () beheaded him. The officials Wang Tengzhi () and Wang Kangchan () then declared Emperor An's restoration at Jiangling. However, with Liu Yi's forces still on the way to Jiangling, Huan Qian and Huan Xuan's nephew Huan Zhen () made a surprise attack on Jiangling, capturing it and seizing Emperor An and Sima Dewen. Huan Zhen and Huan Qian did not try to redeclare Chu; rather, they tried to hold Emperor An as collateral while trying to maintain their status as Jin officials. They initially defeated He Wuji's forces, but by 405, with the other members of the Huan clan (including Huan Xi and Huan Wei () the governor Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, then southwestern Henan and northwestern Hubei) defeated, Jiangling fell to Liu Yi, and Huan Qian and Huan Zhen fled. He Wuji escorted Emperor An back to Jiankang, and Liu Yu effectively became regent, even though the government was at this point still a coalition of near equals.  As regent  = Early years = Liu Yu, although he had ambitions to be emperor, learned from Huan Xuan's failures that he could not act too quickly, but must establish his authority through further victories first, particularly since because he led a coalition of generals and officials with different agendas in his victory over Huan. He therefore proceeded cautiously, initially sharing power with He Wuji and Liu Yi, among others. For the next few years, he also made several offers to resign his posts, judging correctly that the imperial officials would not dare to accept them, to further establish the image that he was indispensable. In spring 405, Mao Qu's soldiers, unhappy that Mao sent them on long-distance campaigns initially against Huan Xuan and then against Huan Zhen, rebelled, supporting the military officer Qiao Zong as their leader. They defeated and killed Mao and captured Chengdu (ÊàêÈÉΩ, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and Qiao Zong established his independent Western Shu state there. Also in 405, Lu Xun, who had in 404 marched south and captured Panyu (Áï™Á¶∫, in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) during the wars relating to Huan Xuan, offered peace to the imperial government by paying a tribute. Liu Yu, believing that he had no abilities to defeat Lu by this point, made Lu the governor of Guang Province (Âª£Â∑û, modern Guangdong and Guangxi) and Lu's brother-in-law and lieutenant Xu Daofu () the governor of Shixing Principality (ÂßãËàà, roughly modern Shaoguan, Guangdong). In 407, Liu Yu commissioned his friend Liu Jingxuan to launch a major attack on Qiao Zong's Western Shu, but in 408, Liu Jingxuan's forces became stalled against the Western Shu general Qiao Daofu () and was forced to retreat when food supplies ran out. = Campaigns against Southern Yan and Lu Xun = In 409, the Southern Yan emperor Murong Chao began a campaign of attacking and pillaging the Jin northern borders, intending to capture men and women to be trained as musicians. In response, Liu Yu decided to launch a campaign to destroy Southern Yan, over the objections of most imperial officials, but was supported by Meng Chang. While Liu Yu was quickly able to defeat Southern Yan's main forces in late 409 and put the Southern Yan capital Guanggu (Âª£Âõ∫, in modern Qingzhou, Shandong) under siege, Guanggu did not fall quickly. While Liu Yu was besieging Guanggu, Xu Daofu persuaded a reluctant Lu Xun (who was afraid of a confrontation with Liu Yu) to attack north, reasoning that eventually when Liu Yu was ready, Liu Yu would attack first, and that with Liu Yu besieging Guanggu, they could capture the rest of the empire together. In spring 410, Liu Yu captured Guanggu, ending Southern Yan, and considered further readying a campaign against Later Qin, but was informed that Lu and Xu were attacking north, and therefore quickly returned south towards Jiankang. Meanwhile, He Wuji led a fleet against Xu at Yuzhang (Ë±´Á´†, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but was defeated and killed by Xu. A second force commanded by Liu Yi was also defeated by Xu and Lu. However, Liu Yi's captured soldiers informed Lu that Liu Yu was on his way back to Jiankang, and Lu, intimidated, considered ending his campaign, but continued to Jiankang at Xu's insistence. A number of imperial officials, including Meng, suggested that Emperor An be taken across the Yangtze River to evade Lu's forces, but Liu Yu refused, choosing to defend Jiankang. Once at Jiankang, Lu refused several strategies that Xu offered that were risky but offered chances of success, instead trying to intimidate Liu Yu's forces into collapsing, which he could not do. Soon he ran out of food supplies and withdrew to Xunyang (Â∞ãÈôΩ, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Liu Yu gave chase, but also ordered his generals Sun Chu () and Shen Tianzi () to take a fleet by sea to attack Panyu, fully confident that he can defeat Lu and make it impossible for Lu to then retreat to his home base. Meanwhile, Xu attacked Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei and Hunan), but was defeated by Liu Daogui, and rejoined Lu, preparing for a confrontation with Liu Yu. Around the new year 411, they engaged Liu Yu at Dalei (Â§ßÈõ∑, in modern Anqing, Anhui), but Liu Yu destroyed their fleet with fire. Lu and Xu fled toward Panyu, which had however been captured by Sun at this point. Lu put Panyu under siege, but Shen, who was then trying to capture other commanderies, returned to Panyu and defeated Lu along with Sun. Lu fled toward Jiao Province (‰∫§Â∑û, modern northern Vietnam) where he was defeated by the governor, Du Huidu (). Lu then killed his wife and concubines and committed suicide by jumping into a river. = Campaigns against Western Shu and Later Qin = With the state having been stabilized after Lu Xun's destruction, Liu Yu again turned his attention outward, hoping to use military victories to propel himself into sufficiently high public standing that he can take the throne for himself. At the same time, however, he began to remove members of his coalition who stood or might stand in his way. In 412, believing that Liu Yi, then governor of Jing Province, was about to act against him along with Liu Yi's cousin Liu Fan () the governor of Yan Province, he arrested Liu Fan and his friend Xie Hun (), and then made a surprise attack against Liu Yi, defeating Liu Yi's forces easily. Liu Yi was killed in flight. In 413, Liu Yu also surprised and killed Zhuge Zhangmin, whom he suspected of considering to act against him when he was away from Jiankang attacking Liu Yi. Meanwhile, in late 412, Liu Yu commissioned the general Zhu Lingshi () to attack Qiao Zong's Western Shu, secretly instructing him to take the long route to Qiao Zong's capital Chengdu by Min River (), rather than the short route by Fu River (). Zhu's forces were able to surprise Qiao Zong's main general Qiao Daofu and Qiao Zong himself, capturing Chengdu in 413 and annexing Western Shu back into Jin. In 414, Liu Yu began to suspect Liu Yi's replacement as the governor of Jing Province, Sima Xiuzhi (), who was a member of the imperial clan and whose son Sima Wensi () had been created the Prince of Qiao and had gathered many adventurers around him. In spring 414, Liu Yu had Sima Wensi's confederates arrested and executed, while delivering Sima Wensi to Sima Xiuzhi, intending for Sima Xiuzhi to show submission by executing Sima Wensi himself. Instead, Sima Xiuzhi only requested that Sima Wensi's princely title be stripped. In spring 415, Liu Yu arrested another son of Sima Xiuzhi, Sima Wenbao (), and Sima Xiuzhi's nephew Sima Wenzu (), ordering the two to commit suicide, and then launched an attack on Sima Xiuzhi, who was joined by Lu Zongzhi () the governor of Yong Province. Initially, Sima Xiuzhi and Lu Zongzhi enjoyed some successes, defeating Liu Yu's son-in-law Xu Kuizhi (), but after Liu Yu himself arrived, he defeated Sima Xiuzhi's forces, capturing Jiangling and forcing Sima Xiuzhi and Lu Zongzhi to flee to Later Qin. Liu Yu now no longer had significant opposition in Jin. In 416, Liu Yu launched a major attack against Later Qin, in light of the recent death of the Later Qin emperor Yao Xing, entrusting the capital to his assistant Liu Muzhi, with his teenage heir apparent Liu Yifu being nominally in charge. In winter 416, the important city Luoyang fell to Liu Yu's general Tan Daoji (). In light of Luoyang's fall, Liu Yu had Emperor An create him Duke of Song and bestow him the nine bestowments, showing his intentions to take the throne eventually, although he declined both honors at that point. In spring 417, Tan Daoji and another general, Shen Linzi (), engaged in a major campaign with Later Qin's most prominent general, Yao Shao () the Duke of Lu, the uncle of the emperor Yao Hong. After a month of battles, Yao Shao was defeated, and he died in anger. With Yao Shao dead, the other Later Qin generals could not resist Jin forces. Liu Yu's fleet, commanded by Wang Zhen'e (ÁéãÈéÆÊÉ°, Wang Meng's grandson), advanced quickly, while Yao Hong tried to first destroy Liu Yu's flank forces, commanded by Shen Linzi's brother Shen Tianzi. Despite Yao Hong's large advantage in numbers, Shen Tianzi crushed him, forcing him to flee back to his capital Chang'an. Wang Zhen'e's fleet then arrived and defeated Later Qin's final resistance, entering Chang'an. Yao Hong surrendered, and Liu Yu had him delivered to Jiankang and executed, ending Later Qin. = Steps toward usurpation = With Later Qin destroyed, there was an expectation that Liu Yu would next advance northwest and either destroy or force the subjugation of the several states in the northwest still -- Xia, Western Qin, Northern Liang, and Western Liang. Indeed, at this point, Western Qin's prince Qifu Chipan, Northern Liang's prince Juqu Mengxun, and Western Liang's prince Li Gao were all sufficiently intimidated that they nominally submitted to Jin's authority. However, Liu Muzhi then died at this time, and Liu Yu, intending on taking the throne, decided to return to Jiankang himself, leaving his 11-year-old son Liu Yizhen () and the generals Wang Zhen'e, Shen Tianzi, Mao Dezu (), and the official Wang Xiu () in charge of Chang'an. With Liu Yu having left Chang'an, Xia's emperor Helian Bobo was intent on taking Chang'an himself. He had his sons Helian Gui () and Helian Chang, along with his general Wang Maide (), make a three-pronged advance toward Chang'an while cutting off the supply route between Luoyang and Chang'an. Meanwhile, with Wang Zhen'e and Shen Tianzi being previously envious of each other, Shen Tianzi suspected Wang Zhen'e of being ready to rebel, and so killed him. Wang Xiu then executed Shen Tianzi, but then Liu Yizhen believed the accusations that Wang Zhen'e was in fact about to rebel and that Wang Xiu was ready to as well, and so executed Wang Xiu. Once Wang Xiu was executed, Liu Yizhen himself was without supervision, and he, in fear of Xia forces, withdrew all of his forces inside Chang'an, and Xia forces then sieged the city. Liu Yu, hearing this, sent Zhu Lingshi to replace Liu Yizhen and ordered Liu Yizhen to withdraw. Liu Yizhen's forces, however, having pillaged Chang'an, could not withdraw quickly, and they were crushed by Xia forces at Qingni (ÈùíÊ≥•, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), with nearly the entire army killed or captured. Liu Yizhen barely escaped with his life, and the Chang'an region became Xia possession, although Jin retained the Luoyang region. Liu Yu, initially not knowing whether Liu Yizhen had survived, prepare a campaign to attack Xia, but once he heard of Liu Yizhen's survival, he stopped those plans. He continued to bestow great power (even if at times nominal) in his brother Liu Daolian and in his sons, to try to further affirm his authority. Meanwhile, Liu Yu, having accepted the Duke of Song title and the nine bestowments in summer 418, had Emperor An create him the Prince of Song, but then publicly declined it. Meanwhile, he became convinced of the truth of a prophecy that stated, \\"There will be two more emperors after Changming.\\" (Changming, which meant \\"dawn,\\" was the courtesy name of Emperor An's father Emperor Xiaowu.) He therefore became resolved to kill Emperor An, and he tried several times to have Emperor An's servants poison him, but because Emperor An's brother Sima Dewen continuously attended to him, the servants had no chance to poison him. However, around the new year 419, Sima Dewen was himself ill and had to be at his house. Liu Yu's assassin Wang Shaozhi () then took the opportunity to kill Emperor An‚Äîaccording to Zizhi Tongjian, by twisting clothes into a rope and then using it to strangle Emperor An. Liu Yu then made Sima Dewen emperor (as Emperor Gong). Emperor Gong's reign was a brief and powerless one. In fall 419, Liu Yu accepted the title Prince of Song. In spring 420, Liu Yu, then at Shouyang (Â£ΩÈôΩ, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) sent his assistant Fu Liang to Jiankang to pressure Emperor Gong to yield the throne. Emperor Gong responded by summoning Liu Yu back to the capital in summer 419, and Fu then offered him a draft of an abdication edict, requesting that he write it personally. Sima Dewen did so, and then left the palace and went to his old house while he was Prince of Langya. Three days later, Liu Yu took the throne and established Liu Song (as Emperor Wu), ending Jin.  Reign  Liu Yu, Emperor Wu. Emperor Wu created the former Jin emperor the Prince of Lingling. He honored his stepmother Princess Dowager Xiao as empress dowager. He created his brother Liu Daolian, his sons, and his nephews princes. In fall 420, he posthumously honored his wife Zang Aiqin (), who had died in 408, empress, and created his oldest son Liu Yifu crown prince. Also, having seen how much damage bad reputation can do to people first hand, he ordered that those who had been labeled undesirables by public opinion be allowed new chances to show their worth. Soon, Emperor Wu, still believing Sima Dewen to be a threat, sent Sima Dewen's former attendant Zhang Wei () a bottle of poisoned wine, ordering him to poison Sima Dewen. Zhang, not wanting to carry out the order, drank the wine himself and died. Meanwhile, however, in order to prevent any likelihood that Sima Dewen would have a male heir, Liu Yu ordered brothers of Sima Dewen's wife Princess Chu, Chu Xiuzhi () and Chu Danzhi () to poison any male children that Princess Chu or Sima Dewen's concubines would bear. Sima Dewen himself feared death greatly, and he and Princess Chu remained in the same house, cooking their own meals, with Princess Chu paying for the material herself. Assassins that Emperor Wu sent initially could find no chance to kill the former emperor. In fall 421, Emperor Wu sent Chu Danzhi and his brother Chu Shudu () to visit their sister. As Princess Chu came out to meet her brothers in a different house, soldiers that Liu Yu sent intruded into Sima Dewen's house and ordered Sima Dewen to take poison. He refused, stating that Buddhism prohibited suicide and that those who committed suicide could not receive human bodies in their next rebirths. The assassins therefore used a blanket to cover his head and asphyxiated him. In 422, having been warned by his official Xie Hui that Crown Prince Yifu was often spending his time with people lacking in wisdom, Emperor Wu considered making Liu Yizhen the Prince of Luling crown prince instead. Xie, however, after meeting with Liu Yizhen, had an even worse opinion of Liu Yizhen, and so Emperor Wu stopped considering so. In summer 422, Emperor Wu became extremely ill, and he entrusted Crown Prince Yifu to Xu Xianzhi, Fu Liang, Xie Hui, and Tan Daoji. He then died, and Liu Yifu took the throne as Emperor Shao. Tomb The western qilin of the Chuning Tomb Liu Yu was buried in the Chuning Tomb (ÂàùÂÆÅÈôµ, Chuning Ling), which is located in what is Jiangning District, in the eastern suburbs of the present-day Nanjing. The only surviving statues of his spirit way are two qilin, facing each other across the street in the appropriately named Qilinpu Cun (\\"Qiling Place Village\\") of the Qilin Town.  Legacy  Liu Yu is mostly remembered as one of greatest generals of the Northern and Southern dynasties. Under him, the Southern Chinese empire came the closest to reconquering the North. Although the territory which he won in the Northwest was quickly lost, his campaigns allowed the Southern dynasties the advantage of defending along the Yellow River, and preserved an independent Southern Chinese state long enough for the Xianbei states in the North to be assimilated.

John Neely Bryan (December 24, 1810 ‚Äì September 8, 1877) was a Presbyterian farmer, lawyer, and tradesman in the United States and founder of the city of Dallas, Texas.  Early life  Bryan was born to James and Elizabeth (Neely) Bryan in Fayetteville, Tennessee. There, he attended the Fayetteville Military Academy and after studying law was admitted to the Tennessee Bar. Around the year 1833 he left Tennessee and moved to Arkansas, where he was an Indian trader. According to some sources, he and a business partner laid out Van Buren, Arkansas.  Exploring Dallas  Bryan visited the Dallas area in 1839, and in 1841, he established a permanent settlement, which eventually became the burgeoning city of Dallas.  Establishment of Dallas  Bryan was very important to early Dallas -- he served as the postmaster, a store owner, a ferry operator (he operated a ferry where Commerce Street crosses the Trinity River today), and his home served as the courthouse. In 1844, he persuaded J. P. Dumas to survey and plot the site of Dallas and possibly helped him with the work. Bryan was instrumental in the organizing of Dallas County in 1846 and in the election by voters of Dallas as its county seat in August 1850 (over the towns of Cedar Springs and Oak Cliff). When Dallas became the county seat, Bryan donated the land for the courthouse. In 1843, he married Margaret Beeman, a daughter of the Beeman family who settled in Dallas from Bird's Fort. The couple had five children. Another Beeman, John, arrived in Dallas in April 1842 and planted the first corn.  Gold rush  In 1849, Bryan went to California during the gold rush but returned within a year. In January 1853 he was a delegate to the Texas state Democratic convention. In 1855, Bryan shot a man who had insulted his wife and fled to the Creek Nation. The man he shot made a full recovery, and Bryan certainly would've been informed, but still Bryan did not return to Dallas for about six years. During that time he travelled to Colorado and California, probably looking for gold. He returned to Dallas in time to take part in a brief military expedition against the Comanche Indians in 1860.  Late life  Bryan joined Col. Nicholas H. Darnell's Eighteenth Texas Cavalry regiment in the winter of 1861 and served with the unit until late 1862 when he was discharged due to his old age and poor health. He returned to Dallas in 1862 and again became actively involved in community affairs. In 1863, he was a trustee for the Dallas Male and Female Academy. In 1866, during a Dallas flood, he was very prominent in aiding those affected. He also chaired a citizens' meeting that pushed the Houston and Texas Central Railway to complete the railway through the city, and presided at a rally that sought to get full political rights for all ex-Confederates. In 1871 and 1872 Bryan became one of the directors of the Dallas Bridge Company, which built the first iron bridge across the Trinity River. He also stood on the platform at the welcoming ceremonies for the Houston and Texas Central Railway when the first train pulled into town in mid-July 1872. By 1874 Bryan's mind was clearly impaired; though, it is not known exactly how. \\"I am the son of John Neely Bryan, now before the court,\\" Edward T. Bryan testified on Feb. 1, 1877. \\"My father is insane.\\" He was admitted to the Texas State Lunatic Asylum in February 1877 and died there on 8 September 1877.Frank X. Tolbert, \\"Tolbert's Texas: Does Dallas' Founder Lie in Lunatic's Grave,\\" Dallas Morning News, July 23, 1970 He is believed to be buried in an unmarked grave in the southeast quadrant of the Austin State Hospital Cemetery. In 2006, Bryan's descendants placed a headstone in the cemetery that reads \\"PVT 18 Texas CAV CSA Dec 24 1810 Sep 8 1877 Founder of Dallas Texas.\\" In 1954, a white granite marker honoring the Dallas founder was erected by the James Butler Bonham chapter of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas in Pioneer Cemetery (Pioneer Plaza). A large marker bearing the name \\"Bryan\\" and displaying two \\"Citizen of the Republic of Texas\\" medallions honoring John Neely Bryan and his wife stands in Riverside Cemetery at Wichita Falls, Texas. It overlooks the graves of Margaret Beeman Bryan (1825-1919), her son John Neely Bryan, Jr. (1846-1926), and other family members. A Texas Historical Marker \\"Beeman Memorial Cemetery,\\" located east of downtown Dallas just off of Dolphin Road, states that John Neely Bryan is buried in the Beeman family plot of his wife, Margaret, and other Beeman family members. This cemetery is somewhat hard to locate, but is located just behind a large Jewish Cemetery (Shearith Israel) on Dolphin Road just south of Military Parkway. The Bryan Pergola, standing on the Grassy Knoll in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, is named after John Neely Bryan (1810-1877), the recognized founder of the City of Dallas.  Cultural references  The Grassy Knoll and Bryan pergola in Dealey Plaza. The concrete pergola upon which Abraham Zapruder was standing during the John F. Kennedy assassination as he made the Zapruder film was originally placed in Dealey Plaza in honor of Bryan, and is named for him.

Settlement  John Neely Bryan, looking for a good trading post to serve Native Americans and settlers, first surveyed the Dallas area in 1839.Dallas Historical Society - Dallas History . Retrieved 20 April 2006. Bryan, who shared Sam Houston's insight into the wisdom of Native American customs, must have realized that Caddo trails he came across intersected at one of the few natural fords for hundreds of kilometers along the wide Trinity floodplain. At what became known as \\"Bryan's Bluff\\", the river, which was an impassable barrier of mud and water between late fall and early spring, narrowed like an hourglass where it crossed a ridge of Austin chalk, providing a hard rock ford that became the natural north‚Äìsouth route between Republic of Texas settlements and those of the expanding United States.. By Jackie McElhaney and Michael V. Hazel. Retrieved 20 April 2006 Bryan also knew that the planned Preston Trail was to run near the ford -- the north‚Äìsouth route and the ford at Bryan's Bluff became more important when the United States annexed Texas in 1845. After Bryan surveyed the area, he returned home to Arkansas. While there, a treaty was signed removing all Native Americans from Northern Texas. When he returned in November 1841, half of his customers, the Native Americans, were gone. He decided that instead of creating a trading post, he would create a permanent settlement, which he founded the same month. About to the northwest of his settlement was a community called Bird's Fort -- Bryan invited the settlers there to live in Dallas at his proposed city. John Beeman arrived in April 1842 and he planted the first corn. Other families soon followed suit, including members of the Peter's Colony settlement nearby. John Neely Bryan was originally almost everything to Dallas: He was the postmaster, a storeowner, a ferry operator (he operated a ferry where Commerce Street crosses the Trinity River today), and his home served as the courthouse. In 1843, the first doctor arrived in Dallas; in 1845, the first lawyer made his home there. In 1845, the first election was held in Dallas over Texas' annexation into the United States. Of the 32 citizens eligible to vote, 29 voted for annexation and 3 voted against it.  Establishment  In 1844, John Neely Bryan convinced J. P. Dumas to survey and lay out a 0.5 square mile (1.3 km2) section of blocks and streets near what later became downtown Dallas. The establishment was named Dallas, and though it has been largely assumed that it was named after George Mifflin Dallas, who became vice president the following March, there are problems with this theory. George M. Dallas lived in Philadelphia and never traveled very far west of the city, and Bryan had never traveled very far east of Memphis. It is doubtful that the two ever met, and there are at least seven other candidates: * Named after George M. Dallas's brother Alexander James Dallas, a U.S. Navy commodore who was stationed in the Gulf of Mexico; * Named after George's and Alexander's father, Alexander James Dallas, who was the United States Secretary of the Treasury around the end of the War of 1812; * Named in a town-naming contest in 1842; * Named after a friend of founder John Neely Bryan. His son later stated that Bryan claimed to have named the town \\"after my friend Dallas\\" (a person whose identity is not certain). John Neely Bryan later died in a psychiatric ward, so his \\"friend\\" may not have been a real person. * Named after Joseph Dallas, who settled near Dallas in 1843 * Named after \\"Dallas\\", the modern version of the Scottish Gaelic word \\"Dalais\\" which means 'valley of water' * Named after the Scottish village of Dallas, in Moray, after which a number of places worldwide are named. Dallas County was established in 1846 and the city of Dallas was set as the temporary county seat. In 1850, Dallas became the permanent seat over Cedar Springs and Hord's Ridge (Oak Cliff), both of which now lie within the city's limits.

Originally serialized in the yaoi magazine Shousetsu June between December 1986 and October 1987, the story was collected into a hardbound novel that was released in Japan in 1990. This futuristic tale is set in a world where the Elites are assigned various social classes based on their hair color in the city of Tanagura. Iason Mink, a high- class \\"Blondie\\", runs into Riki, a black-haired \\"Mongrel\\", and makes him his \\"Pet\\", which Riki resents being. As Riki learns of the dangers Iason faces by keeping him, he finds himself developing feelings for his master. Focusing on the relationship between Iason and Riki, Ai no Kusabi also explores issues of caste systems and social exclusion. The novel was partially adapted into a two-episode original video animation (OVA) by Anime International Company (AIC), with the first episode released in August 1992 and the second in May 1994. In November 1993, an audio drama entitled Erogenous Dark was released focusing on a time period left unexplored in the original novels. A new twelve-episode OVA adaptation, also from AIC, was scheduled to begin releasing in Japan in the spring of 2010, but was cancelled for financial reasons. The project was picked up again and was released on January 18, 2012. However, the series was once again discontinued after four episodes. The novel is licensed for an English language release in North America by Digital Manga Publishing, which published the novel over an eight-volume series. Plot =Setting= Ai no Kusabi takes place on the world of Amo√Ø, which is ruled by a computer named Jupiter. Jupiter has introduced a number of strict social rules to society: Elites of Tanagura, Midas citizens, and Mongrels from Ceres. The Elites are genetically engineered by Jupiter, are of the highest social class, which is determined by hair color, and occupy the capital city of Tanagura. Under Jupiter's restrictions, the Elites are sterile and forbidden from indulging in sexual activities. They keep \\"pets\\" (adolescents in their late teens) for about a year, for purely voyeuristic purposes, before discarding them. Further emasculation is seen in the \\"Furniture\\", adolescent boys who serve the Elites. Outside Tanagura's walls is the satellite pleasure city of Midas, which is heavily occupied by rich citizens and tourists alike. Near Midas is an independent slum area called Ceres. The mostly male population of Ceres lives in high poverty; therefore, they are often called \\"Mongrels\\" by both Midas citizens and Tanagura elites and are looked down upon. Terminology =Amo√Ø= Amo√Ø is the twelfth planet in the Garan star system and was once a small, barren planet. Amo√Ø was first settled by a group of scientists who sought to make a metropolis society unconstrained by political pressures and religious taboos. They created Tanagura as their central city and made the supercomputer named \\"Jupiter.\\" Jupiter eventually attained a consciousness of its own and seized power over Tanagura. Over time, Amo√Ø constructed the city of Midas near Tanagura and developed many independent city states, with Tanagura as the planet's governed capital. =Tanagura= Tanagura is the metallic city under the direct and complete control of Jupiter, who rules over Amo√Ø. In Tanagura, Eos Tower is the palace where Jupiter's android-like elites live and work while Jupiter itself resides in its Jupiter Tower. All elites are physically perfect and beautiful, with immortal bodies and long hair, along with strength greater than normal humans. They are sterile and their highly advanced brains are the only organic part of their bodies. Tanagura applied a hair-color caste system called \\"NORAM\\" to those who work there: *Blondie - The \\"elites of the elite\\", Blondies are the highest social class and genetically engineered by Jupiter. With only thirteen Blondies, they make up the \\"Tanagura Syndicate\\" and are the supreme leaders of Tanagura, with Iason Mink as the foremost head. They have the authority to communicate directly with Jupiter, mainly Iason, and are aware of all the secrets of Amo√Ø and its underworld. *Platina - Silver-haired elites that hold the highest and various leadership positions. *Ruby, Jade, and Sapphire - Subdivided by their individual specialties, they are advisers to the Onyx elites. *Onyx - The \\"face\\" of Tanagura, the black-haired elites are the lowest of the caste with external responsibilities. They take administrator positions and are in charge of government businesses. Characters =Main= * : :The primary protagonist of the series. Due to his dark hair and eyes, he is known as \\"Riki the Dark\\" and is the former gang leader of the Bison gang in Ceres. Considered the \\"charisma of the slums\\", Riki was once proud, rebellious, fierce, and defiant, but after his three years of being Iason's pet, he became more mature and quiet. Before becoming Iason's pet, Riki was once the lover of Guy, the second-in-command of Bison, but their relationship ended once Iason forced Riki to be his pet for three years, which had a crushing effect on his human pride. Throughout the story, Riki is torn between his pride and the feelings he has for Iason that he is unwilling to acknowledge. * : :The most superior and powerful Blondie in Tanagura, and the head of the Syndicate, Tanagura's black market for pet trade. Iason has an elegant and calm demeanor that hides a passionate, ruthless, manipulative, and unforgiving nature. He is in love with his pet Riki, a mongrel from the slums, which casts a dark shadow over his seeming perfection. At first, Iason is interested in what it would be like to have a gang leader from the slums as a pet, instead of one of those non-thinking pets bred by the Academy, but slowly he begins to love Riki to the point of obsession. * : :The former pairing partner of Riki's and is second-in-command of the gang Bison. Much like Iason, he is in love with Riki, although their relationship became strained after Riki's disappearance from the slums. Once he realized the connection between Riki's disappearance for three years and Iason, Guy attempts to do whatever he can in order to retrieve Riki from Iason. * : :A former Furniture of Iason, and Iason's right-hand man in the black market. A computer genius, he almost uncovered what he calls the \\"Secrets of Tanagura\\" during time as Iason's Furniture, but was caught in the act by Iason, who punished him by slashing his left cheek, which earned him a scar that he usually covers with his hair. Although he respects Riki, he is willing to take part in Iason's plans to make Riki return to Iason by manipulating Kirie. Despite his cool, seemingly uncaring nature, he cares for both Iason and Riki deeply and tries his best to look after both of them. * : :A Blondie who is the second-in-command of Tanagura, chief scientist of Tanagura, and Iason Mink's best friend. He serves as the voice of reason, concern and societal pressure as Iason's infatuation with Riki becomes more obvious. Raoul possesses the ability to tamper with minds, which he does not want to use on Iason in case his relationship with Riki worsens. In the audio book, he is voiced by Ikeda Hidekazu. * : :The youngest member of Bison at 17-year-old with his right eye is colored gold to sandy brown and the left eye is colored blue. Ambitious and sly, Kirie is lured into lucrative deals by Katze as part of Iason's scheme to bring Riki back after his year of freedom. Although Riki harbors an intense hatred for Kirie because he reminds Riki of his former proud and rebellious self, Kirie possesses an obsessive love for Riki. In the audiobook, he is voiced by Taiki Matsuno. In the 1990s OVAs, he was voiced by Shigeru Nakahara. In the remake OVAs, he voiced by Showtaro Morikubo. In the English dub, he is voiced by Bryson Baugus. =Minor Characters= * :Also known as Lambda 3000, is the artificial intelligence that rules Amo√Ø. Often referred to as a \\"she\\", Jupiter places her android-like Blondie \\"children\\" at the pinnacle of society, whom she only allows only speak to her, mainly Iason. Although Iason is said to be her favorite \\"son\\", Jupiter disapproves of Iason's infatuation of Riki and is willing to have his mind wiped if Iason's obsession over Riki worsens. In the 1990s OVAs, she looks like a silver-colored statue in hologram form. In the remake OVAs, she takes the appearance of a large violet hologram with razor-sharped nails, a long, pointed nose, silted eyes with light violet irises with one on her forehead, a broad grin, and mechanic designs on her arms. * : :A Blondie and is responsible with supervising the parties, security details, and helps appease any trouble that might arise in Eos Tower. He is known as an \\"elegant noble\\" among the Blondies, and takes great pride in his position as supervisor over Eos Tower. Like all Blondies, he has a fascination over Riki, although Orphe also despises him because he was the first person to get past his security details in Eos Tower (due to Iason's former Furniture Daryl's assistance). In the remake OVAs, he is voiced by. In the English dub, he is voiced by * : :A Blondie and the chief of Midas with a wicked sense of humor. Like all Blondies, he has a fascination over Riki and finds the scandals Riki causes as a source of entertainment, but he also disapproves of his actions and Iason's infatuation for him. * : :A Blondie and is charge of overseeing Tanagura but holds little power over Eos Tower. Like all Blondies, he has a fascination over Riki, but to a lesser extent because Riki and his pet often fight with each other. He openly voices his disapproval over Riki to Iason and enjoys criticizing Iason about Riki's scandals. * : :An eighteen-year-old castrated boy that served as Iason's former Furniture and Riki's caretaker. Like all Furnitures in Tanagura, Daryl was raised in Ceres at the orphanage, Guardian, along with Riki. Despite being three years older than Riki and having never met him in Guardian, Daryl knew Riki by his reputation and admired him. Daryl loved him because of his pride and his will not to bow down, which continued when Daryl met Riki again when he first came to Tanagura. As Riki's caretaker, Daryl tried his best effort to look after Riki, much to Riki's annoyance, while still maintaining his distance. Although Riki never treated with Daryl with a lot of respect, he found a comfortable companion in Daryl, who was dutiful, kind, and taught him the rules of Tanagura. Like Katze, Daryl was skilled at hacking, and used this talent to hack Eos Tower's security system to help Riki escape. Having aided an escape attempt and hacking Tanagura's system, he is executed for his crimes; however, Daryl did not regret his actions, as he was happy that Riki was still himself. Although most of Eos Tower knows of Daryl's fate, Riki never knew that Daryl tried to helped him or that he was killed for his actions. Knowing that Riki will feel guilty for Daryl's death and would keep Daryl's memory in his heart, Iason kept Daryl's death as a secret from Riki and told him that Daryl was replaced by Cal due to rearrangement with the Furnitures. * : :Raoul Am's female Pet of the highest breeding and Riki's only friend in Eos. Unlike most pets, she was kind to Riki and fell in love with him, which led to them having forbidden intercourse. Although Riki did cared for her, he used her as a way to test Iason's feelings and make him jealous and ruin his public image. When the affair went public, Iason punished Riki and forced him to tell Mimea the motive behind his actions over a holoscreen. However, Mimea insisted that it was made just to push her and Riki apart, and she told Riki that she will be paired to another pet named Jena, whom she described as a sex freak with nothing but his looks and that thinking of carrying his children pained her. As Riki was silent because his pet ring was fully activated at that time and he had a hard time speaking and breathing, this led Mimea to think that he had abandoned her and calling him a coward. When Riki returned to Eos Tower after three years, Raoul replaced Mimea with a new pet, and Riki never heard what happened to her. * : :A friend and member of Riki's former gang Bison from Ceres. Although typically easy- going, Luke is daring and cares deeply about his friends. While Luke is known to prefers virgins as pairing partners, Luke has an infatuation towards Riki and is the only member in Bison to shows his desire openly, but backs off once Riki makes it clear he's uninterested. * : :A friend and member of Riki's former gang Bison from Ceres. Much like Luke, Norris is energetic and easy- going, though has shown a thoughtful side at times. Although Norris once had a secret infatuation towards Riki, Norris found a serious and happy relationship with Maxi, a mechanic ten years older than him. In the 1990s OVAs, he was voiced by. In the remake OVAs, he voiced by. * : :A friend and member of Riki's former gang Bison from Ceres. Compare to the other members of Bison, Sid is more quiet and stoic, and is a good fighter. Like Luke and Norris, Sid has an infatuation towards Riki, but he kept his desires a secret out of respect for Guy. During Riki's three-year \\"disappearance\\" from Ceres, Sid was the one who recruited Kirie into Bison as the teenager's proud rebelliousness reminded him of Riki. * : :The young castrated boy that serves as Iason's Furniture and Riki's caretaker, replacing Daryl after his death. Much like Daryl, Cal is dutiful and quiet, but wasn't overly attentive to Riki as Daryl was. As Riki met Cal after he learns that all Furniture are secretly from Ceres, Riki treats Cal with more respect than he did with Daryl, and the two established a more professional relationship, as Riki wishes not to get attached to Cal. * : * : * : * : * : Media =Novel= Written by Rieko Yoshihara, the individual chapters of Ai no Kusabi were serialized in the yaoi magazine Shousetsu June between December 1986 and October 1987. The chapters were collected and published as a single hardbound novel in 1990. The series was later released in a revised and greatly expanded paperback edition from Seibid≈ç Shuppan under their Crystal imprint, however the Crystal edition is incomplete, covering only six of eight books. The series was then acquired by Tokuma Shoten and a complete edition was published in six volumes under their Chara imprint; the first four are semi-omnibus (volumes 1-4 correspond to Crystal volumes 1-6) and the final two are the previously unreleased material. The novel was licensed for an English language release in North America by Digital Manga Publishing (DMP). The English edition from Jun√© was originally based on the Crystal edition, and will have eight volumes (corresponding to Crystal 1-6 plus Chara 5 and 6). The first volume was released on November 20, 2007 and the sixth on July 28, 2009.

The first episode was released in August 1992, and the second in May 1994. Directed by Akira Nishimori and Katsuhito Akiyama, the episodes were based on a screenplay written by Naoko Hasegawa. They featured character designs by Naoyuki Onda and music composed by Toshio Yabuki. The plot slightly differed from the novels' storyline, but kept the main story points intact. =Remake= A second, twelve-episode anime OVA adaptation, also from AIC, was scheduled to begin releasing in Japan Fall 2010. Due to financial issues, production was cancelled for a period of time, but has now been taken up again and was scheduled for January 18, 2012 instead. Akiyama directed again and Onda provided the character designs. The screenplay was written by Yoshihara herself. The Blu-ray release of the OVA included a new short story by Yoshihara. Since the eight minutes preview, the first four episodes have been released. Anime licensor Media Blasters announced they licensed the remake first four OVAs for North American release in December 2012. However, on November 28, 2012, they notified retailers that it will be delayed until April 23, 2013. On October 11, 2017, Media Blasters announced they will be re-releasing Ai no Kusabi on Blu-ray with English dub, which was released on December 19, 2017. On September 20, 2018, Toku adds Ai no Kusabi to its streaming service, allowing viewers to watch the OVAs in Japanese with English subtitles. Since the fourth episode's premiere in 2012, the remake have been discontinued for unknown reasons. Reception Mania's Danielle Van Gorder felt the prose of the first novel was \\"florid\\", and criticized the finishing point of the second novel as anticlimactic. She found the characterization of Iason in the third novel to be realistic and compelling, and felt the theme of the fourth novel was power. Jonathan Clements compared Yoshihara's writing style to \\"Ranpo Edogawa's sexually charged mysteries\\" and felt Ai no Kusabi shared themes with Sh≈çz≈ç Numa's science fiction. Patrick Drazen has described the Ai no Kusabi OVA as a \\"magnum opus\\" of the yaoi genre, and the setting as dystopian, similar to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy liken the society of Ai no Kusabi to that of Ancient Greece, where power was restricted to a class and women do not figure significantly. They consider it ironic that Jupiter is a feminine computer, and describe her as being like Ghost in the Shell's Motoko Kusanagi ‚Äî Jupiter is \\"a man-made idea of the female in a world run by masculine elites\\". Anime News Network's Maral Agnerian praised its interesting, well- developed plot and \\"fleshed out and complex\\" work. She also praises it for being one of the few series from its time to contain \\"actual gay sex in it instead of the usual angsty moping and shoujo-esque sparkly kisses\\", while noting that the scenes are primarily in the second episode. Anime News Network's Justin Sevakis highlighted the OVA as a \\"Buried Treasure\\", calling it \\"one of the best yaoi anime\\". He described Riki and Iason as both being \\"alpha-males\\", rather than a seme/uke pairing, and noted how the costuming was elegant for the higher echelons of society and revealing for the lower classes. He criticized the OVA's adaptation of the story, explaining that it was assumed all viewers would be already familiar with the tale through Shousetsu June.

Its story is a continuation of the fairy tale \\"Snow White\\", wherein the titular heroine and the Prince are about to be married, but a new threat appears in the form of the late evil Queen's vengeful brother Lord Maliss. The film replaces the Dwarfs with their female cousins, called the Dwarfelles, who aid Snow White against Maliss. Happily Ever After is unrelated to Filmation's fellow A Snow White Christmas, a television animated film that was the company's earlier Snow White sequel. It was troubled by severe legal problems with The Walt Disney Company, and had a poor financial and critical reception following its wide release in 1993. A video game adaptation was released in 1994. Plot The film starts as the Looking Glass recaps the story of \\"Snow White\\". The cruel Queen is gone forever and the kingdom is now at peace as Snow White and the Prince prepare to get married. Meanwhile, back at the castle of the Queen, her animal minions celebrate their freedom by throwing a party for themselves. The Queen's equally evil wizard brother, Lord Maliss, arrives at the castle, looking for his sister. After learning about the Queen's recent demise, he vows to avenge her death by any means. He transforms into a wyvern and takes control of the castle, transforming the area surrounding the castle into a perilous wasteland. Afterwards, Scowl the owl starts training his companion, a purple bat named Batso, on how to be evil. The next day, Snow White and the Prince are in the meadow picking flowers for their wedding, when suddenly Lord Maliss, in his dragon form, begins attacking Snow White and the Prince as they are traveling to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. He takes away the Prince, who tried to fight him, but Snow White manages to flee into the woods. Snow White reaches the cottage and meets the Dwarves' female cousins, the Seven \\"Dwarfelles\\": Muddy, Sunburn, Blossom, Marina, Critterina, Moonbeam, and Thunderella. The Dwarves have left the cottage after they bought another mine in a different kingdom, but the Dwarfelles gladly assist Snow White, taking her to visit Mother Nature at Rainbow Falls. Mother Nature has given the Dwarfelles individual powers to assist her; she holds Thunderella accountable for not being able to master her powers correctly, accuses the other Dwarfelles of improperly using their powers, and threatens to take them away as punishment. Lord Maliss attacks them, but Mother Nature shoots him with lightning, causing him to crash and return to his human form. Before leaving, Lord Maliss informs Snow White that the Prince is held captive in his castle. Snow White and the Dwarfelles travel to Lord Maliss' castle in the Realm of Doom, along the way encountering a strange cloaked humanoid known as the Shadow Man. Lord Maliss sends his horned wolves after the group, and they manage to escape with the help of the Shadow Man. Lord Maliss is furious at this failure and transforms into his dragon form, finally capturing Snow White successfully by himself and taking her to the castle. The Dwarfelles follow them and sneak into the castle as well while fending off Maliss's minions. In the castle, Snow White is reunited with her Prince, who begins acting strangely, and takes her through a secret passage to supposedly escape. When Snow White realizes that he is not the real Prince but is actually Lord Maliss in disguise, he attempts to throw a magical red cloak on Snow White to petrify her into stone. He almost succeeds, but is attacked by the Shadow Man, whom he overpowers and seemingly kills. The Dwarfelles arrive and attack Lord Maliss as well, but fail and become petrified themselves. The only one unharmed is Thunderella, who finally gains control of her powers and assists Snow White to defeat Lord Maliss. The cape is thrown on him and Lord Maliss is permanently petrified in mid-transition between his human and wyvern form. As the sun shines onto the castle, the Dwarfelles are restored back to their normal selves. The Shadow Man wakes up and he turns out to be the Prince. The Prince reveals that Lord Maliss had cast a spell on him and he has been watching over Snow White during her journey, guarding her with his life. Mother Nature decides to let the Dwarfelles keep their powers because they have finally proven themselves by working together as one, and she allows them to attend Snow White's wedding. In the end, Mother Nature takes in Batso and Scowl to be trained as her new apprentices. Snow White and the Prince are reunited, as the two of them share a kiss, and begin to live happily ever after.

Filmation had previously developed a plan to create a series of direct-to-video sequels to popular Disney motion pictures, but only this film and Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night were ever completed. According to the producer Lou Scheimer, the black actress Irene Cara's casting as Snow White was regarded by many (including Cara herself) at the time as strangely \\"colorblind\\". The Mother Nature's original casting actress was Joni Mitchell. Scheimer also noted his version of the Snow White as the story's actual heroine as it is she who rescues the prince in an inversion of the traditional version. Lord Maliss was based on Basil Rathbone. However, the Walt Disney Productions chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and spokesman Tom Deegan regarded the projects as \\"blatant rip-offs\\" of their properties. This led to a lawsuit by The Walt Disney Company in 1987 following the release of Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night, Afterwards Filmation promised their characters would not resemble the ones from the Disney version and changed the title of the film to Happily Ever After.SNOW WHITE REVISITED: THE QUEEN'S DEAD, BUT CONFLICT ISN'T BANISHED, Dayton Daily News, May 28, 1993. Working titles included Snow White in the Land of Doom, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfelles, and Snow White: The Adventure Continues. Happily Ever After was reportedly completed by 1988 and was supposed to be released in the United States in 1990; however, Filmation went out of business in 1989.\\"Group W sells Filmation.\\" Broadcasting, February 13, 1989, pg. 94 While the film did receive a 1990 theatrical release in France, it was not released to theaters in the United States until May 28, 1993, during the same summer that Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was re-released theatrically. However, it took only $1.76 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend,Snow White sequel opens on a sad note, Lodi News-Sentinel, June 2, 1993. $2.8 million after ten days, and $3.2 million by the next month. The release was preceded by a $10 million advertising campaign and a substantial merchandising effort from the North American distributor First National Film Corp; First National's bankruptcy followed just weeks after the film's failed premiere and its President, Milton Verret, was later charged with defrauding investors and found guilty. Afterwards the film was released on VHS by Worldvision and later on DVD (in an edit censoring some violence) by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. As of 2019, the film is now owned by Universal Pictures through DreamWorks Animation under their ownership of DreamWorks Classics, which holds the rights to much of the Filmation catalog, including this film. Reception Despite a substantial advertising campaign and having been expected to become \\"one of the biggest hits of the year,\\" Happily Ever After did poorly in the box office during its theatrical run. Its domestic gross was only $3,299,382. Critics generally disliked the film. According to Stephen Holden of The New York Times, \\"visually, Happily Ever After is mundane. The animation is jumpy, the settings flat, the colors pretty but less than enchanting. The movie's strongest element is its storytelling, which is not only imaginative but also clear and smoothly paced.\\" Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times opined the characters (especially the Prince) were \\"bland\\" and called the film's songs \\"instantly forgettable.\\" Rita Kemple of The Washington Post derided the \\"inane\\" humor attempts as well as \\"badly drawn characters\\" and their \\"clumsy\\" animation.Rita Kempley, Happily Ever After¬í, The Washington Post, May 29, 1993 Desert News' Chris Hicks similarly wrote, \\"Sadly, the animation here is weak, the gags even weaker and the story completely uninvolving.\\" Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a score of F and recommended to \\"give this Snow White the big kiss-off.\\"Steve Daly, Happily Ever After, Entertainment Weekly, Jun 04, 1993. Chicago Tribune's Mark Caro wrote that the comparison with Disney's classic Snow White \\"couldn't be more brutal.\\" Currently the film has a 40% on Rotten Tomatoes. Some other reviews were more positive. Jeff Shannon of Seattle Times opined \\"this one's a cut above in the animation contest, deserving attention in the once-exclusive realm of Disney and Don Bluth. It almost, but not quite, escapes those nagging comparisons.\\" Ralph Novak of People wrote that although \\"the animation is less sophisticated than the Disney standard,\\" the story \\"moves nicely, though,\\" with a \\"colorful\\" cast of voices. Candice Russell of Sun-Sentinel called it \\"a sweet and likable film,\\" crediting a screenplay \\"that avoids cuteness and sentimentality and remembers that kiddie fare is fun\\" and \\"a few charming songs adding to the merriment.\\" Video game An unreleased Nintendo Entertainment System video game was planned in 1991. A Sega game was also considered in 1993. An eventual Super Nintendo Entertainment System version was developed by ASC Games and released by Imagitec Design four years later (and one year after the film's release) in 1994.

Life  Wangenheim was born Ingo Clemens Gustav Adolf Freiherr von Wangenheim in Wiesbaden, Hesse, to parents Eduard Clemens Freiherr von Wangenheim and Minna Mengers. Both of his parents were performers; his father, who used the stage name Eduard von Winterstein, appeared in over 200 films between 1910 and 1960. Wangenheim made his screen debut in 1914 in Passionels Tagebuch and went on to star in many silent features. Among his works were Fritz Lang's early science fiction film, Frau im Mond (as \\"Windegger\\"), and Karl Heinz Martin's Das Haus zum Mond. In 1921, Wangenheim was cast in what would prove to be his most enduring role, that of Thomas Hutter (Jonathan Harker) in F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. A member of the Communist Party of Germany since 1921, Wangenheim founded the Communist theatre company Die Truppe '31 in 1931. Die Truppe '31 produced three plays, authored and directed by Wangenheim, before it was shut down by order of the Nazi regime in 1933. Wangenheim fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s and found refuge in the Soviet Union. While living in exile at Moscow's Hotel Lux, he continued writing and producing movies, such as Der Kampf (1936), an anti-Nazi protest film, and was the head of the German language Cabaret \\"Kolonne Links\\". In 1936, during the Stalinist purges, he denounced his colleagues Carola Neher and Anatol Becker as Trotskyites. Becker was executed and Neher died in the Gulag system after five years in prison.Reinhard M√ºller \\"Menschenfalle Moskau.

Gustav von Wangenheim's son claimed his father, after being arrested by the NKVD and a lengthy interrogation, signed a statement that implicated Carola Neher as being \\"anti soviet\\" but had in fact explicitly refuted the accusation that Neher and her husband Anatol Becker had planned to murder Stalin.Vgl. Friedel von Wangenheim: Mein Vater Gustav Frhr. v. Wangenheim und der Fall der Schauspielerin Carola Neher, in: Wangenheim Nachrichten Nr. 25 vom Dezember 1998.

Gustav von Wangenheim with K√§the Dorsch Wangenheim was married to Inge von Wangenheim, n√©e Franke, from 1931 to 1954, when the marriage was annulled. The couple had one son, Friedel von Wangenheim, and 2 daughters, the twins Elisabeth and Eleonora von Wangenheim.

It is a bluish gray bird found in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States to Central Mexico. This species is an early offshoot of the genus Callipepla, diverging in the Pliocene. This bird is named for the scaly appearance of its breast and back feathers. Along with its scaly markings, the bird is easily identified by its white crest that resembles a tuft of cotton. The nest is typically a grass-lined hollow containing 9‚Äì16 speckled eggs. When disturbed, it prefers to run rather than fly. Widespread and common throughout its range, the scaled quail is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Distribution and taxonomy Scaled quail occur from south-central Arizona, northern New Mexico, east-central Colorado, and southwestern Kansas south through western Oklahoma and western and central Texas into Mexico to northeastern Jalisco, Guanajuato, Queretaro, Hidalgo, and western Tamaulipas. It has been introduced to Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and to the United States in Hawaii, central Washington, eastern Nevada, and Nebraska, but is only considered established in central Washington and eastern Nevada.Long, John L.

It is the palest subspecies, adapted to dry and sandy habitat. *Callipepla squamata castanogastris Brewster, 1883 (chestnut-bellied scaled quail). Found in southern Texas from Eagle Pass and San Antonio south to adjacent northwestern Mexico (Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas). Similar individuals are sometimes found in the extreme northeast and west of the species' range.Schemnitz, Sanford D. (1994): Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata). In: Poole, A. & Gill, F.: The Birds of North America 106. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, PA & The American Ornithologists' Union, Washington, D.C. The chestnut brown belly distinguishes it from all other subspecies; it is also darker than the other two found in the USA. Plant communities According to Ligon,Ligon, J. S. (1961). New Mexico birds and where to find them. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press the distribution of scaled quail is largely coextensive with mesquite (Prosopis spp.), condalia (Condalia spp.), and cholla (Cylindropuntia spp.). In Oklahoma, scaled quail occur in sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia)-grassland, pinyon-juniper (Pinus spp.-Juniperus spp.), and shortgrass High Plains.DeGraaf, Richard M.; Scott, Virgil E.; Hamre, R. H.; et al. (1991). Forest and rangeland birds of the United States: Natural history and habitat use. Agric. Handb. 688. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Sand sagebrush-grasslands include sand sagebrush, soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), and sand plum (Prunus watsonii). Scaled Quail in Oklahoma inhabit rough or rolling land, especially where sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), mesquite, cactus (Opuntia spp. and others), yucca (Yucca spp.), juniper, sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii), and rocks furnish cover. In Colorado, scaled quail occupy sand sagebrush and/or yucca stands on sandy soils. The cover types used by scaled quail in Colorado are, in descending order, sand sagebrush- grassland, pinyon-juniper, dense cholla-grassland, dryland farmland, irrigated farmland, and greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.)-saltbush (Atriplex spp.) washes. Scaled Quail made little or no use of sparse cholla-grassland, riparian areas, reseeded grasslands, or shortgrass prairie disclimax.Hoffman, Donald M. (1965). The scaled quail in Colorado: Range‚Äìpopulation status‚Äìharvest. Tech. Publ. No. 18. Denver, CO: Colorado Department of Game, Fish, and Parks Timing of major life events In Arizona, pairing and maximum dispersal is complete by mid-June. Nesting probably does not begin until early July. In Oklahoma, egg laying usually starts in late April. Completed clutches have been found as early as May 8. Egg laying occurs from March to June in Texas and Mexico, and from April to September in New Mexico. Nests with eggs were reported as early as April 15 in New Mexico. Scaled quail lay from 9 to 16 eggs; most clutches are 12 to 14 eggs. Eggs are incubated by the female for 21 to 23 days. Double-brooding (the production of two consecutive broods in one season) is common. In west Texas, Wallmo observed the male rearing the first brood while the female began a second clutch. Sutton stated, however, that scaled quail in Oklahoma are probably single-brooded, but have hatched broods as late as September 6. Ehrlich and others also list scaled quail as single- brooded. The precocial young leave the nest shortly after hatching. They are accompanied by at least one, usually both, parents, who show them how to find food. The young fledge rapidly (age at fledging not reported in the literature), and are adult size in 11 to 15 weeks.Ehrlich, Paul R.; Dobkin, David S.; Wheye, Darryl. (1988) The birder's handbook: a field guide to the natural history of North American birds. New York: Simon & Schuster, Inc. . Scaled quail are fairly sedentary. The winter home ranges of scaled quail coveys varied from . The home ranges of separate coveys overlap only slightly or not at all. From September to November scaled quail coveys maintain stable territories.Goodwin, John G., Jr.; Hungerford, C. Roger. 1977. Habitat use by native Gambel's and scaled quail and released masked bobwhite quail in southern Arizona. Res. Pap. RM-197. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. In Arizona, 75 to 90% of a population apparently moved off of a breeding area by mid-November, moving to nearby mountain foothills. The mountain habitat was consistent with that found on the breeding area. In March the population on the breeding area increased again, with most birds in groups of four to eight. The average winter covey size for scaled quail is around 30 birds, although coveys of up to 150 birds have been reported. Preferred habitat Scaled quail inhabit dry, open valleys, plains, foothills, rocky slopes, draws, gullies, and canyons that have a mixture of bare ground, low herbaceous growth, and scattered brushy cover. Good scaled quail habitat is characterized by low-growing grasses with forbs and shrubs. Overall ground cover is between 10 and 50%. Trees and shrubs should be less than tall. Scaled quail avoid the dense growth associated with streamsides. Transmitter-fitted scaled quail had individual home range sizes of . An absolute requirement by scaled quail for a source of open water has not been established; there is some debate in the literature whether there is such a requirement.Johnsgard, Paul A. (1988) The quails, partridges, and francolins of the world. New York: Oxford University Press Schemnitz, Sanford D. (1961). Ecology of the scaled quail in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Wildlife Monographs: No. 8. Bethesda, MD: The Wildlife Society, pp. 5‚Äì47 Scaled quail have been reported as inhabiting an area from the nearest water in Arizona. In New Mexico, it was not unusual to find Scaled Quail from water. Wallmo Wallmo, O. C. 1956. Ecology of scaled quail in west Texas. Contribution of the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act; Special report: Project W-57-R; Department of Wildlife Management, A & M College of Texas. Austin, TX: Texas Game and Fish Commission, Division of Wildlife Restoration. observed winter coveys from water in Big Bend National Park in southwestern Texas. In Arizona, scaled quail summer habitat is seldom within of water. Scaled quail were observed drinking at stock tanks from April to June (which was a dry period during the course of the study) every 2 to 3 days. In Oklahoma, scaled quail often migrate to farms and ranches in winter and are thus closer to a source of water in winter than in summer. DeGraaf and others reported that in winter, scaled quail are usually found within of a source of water. Cover requirements Feeding cover: scaled quail use grass clumps and shrubs for cover while feeding. In one study they were frequently seen crossing of bare ground. When disturbed, scaled quail hid in snakeweed (Gutierrezia spp.) or in grass clumps. In June and July foraging occurs on open grasslands which are not used at other times. Loafing cover: scaled quail coveys occupy loafing or resting cover after early morning feeding periods. Scaled quail occupy desert grassland or desert scrub with a minimum of one loafing covert per approximately .Harrison, H. H. (1979). A field guide to western birds' nests. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. .Campbell, Howard; Martin, Donald K.; Ferkovich, Paul E.; Harris, Bruce K. (1973). Effects of hunting and some other environmental factors on scaled quail in New Mexico. Wildlife Monographs No. 34. Bethesda, MD: The Wildlife Society In northwestern Texas, loafing coverts were characterized by: (1) overhead woody cover, (2) lateral screening cover, (3) a central area with bare soil, and (4) one or more paths through the lateral cover. Covert heights ranged from high and in diameter. Cholla formed all or part of the overhead cover of 85% of coverts, even though they were dominant at only 12% of the study locations. In areas where scaled quail occur without cholla, woody species such as wolfberry (Lycium spp.) and mesquite are important for overhead cover.Stormer, Fred A. (1981). Characteristics of scaled quail loafing coverts in northwest Texas. Res. Note RM-395. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station In Oklahoma pinyon-juniper habitats, scaled quail use the shade of tree cholla (Cylindropuntia imbricata) and human-made structures. In Arizona, scaled quail occupied wolfberry and mesquite tall for loafing cover. This overhead cover provides midday shade, but is open at the base to allow easy escape from predators. In Oklahoma, winter home ranges always contained skunkbush sumac, tree cholla, or human- made structures providing overhead cover. Night-roosting cover: scaled quail roosts were observed in yucca (Yucca angustifolia), tree cholla, and true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus)-yucca-fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica) vegetation types. The height of vegetation used for night roosts was less than . Nesting cover: In March or April winter coveys spread out into areas with less cover. This use of areas with less cover coincides with a seasonal decrease in the number of raptors in the same area. Scaled quail nests are constructed under tufts of grasses, and are sheltered by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), mesquite, catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), cactus, or yucca; under dead Russian-thistle (Salsola kali), mixed forbs, or soapweed yucca; or sheltered in old machinery or other human-made debris. In Oklahoma, 66% of nests were in one of four situations: (1) dead Russian-thistle, (2) machinery and junk, (3) mixed forbs, and (4) soapweed yucca. In New Mexico, ordination of breeding birds and vegetative microhabitats indicated that scaled quail were associated with increased levels of patchiness and increased cover of mesquite and cactus. Food habits Scaled quail are opportunistic eaters. Seeds are consumed year-round. Large seeds (such as those of mesquite and snakeweed) are important in Scaled quail diets. Other seeds include those of elbowbush (Forestiera angustifolia), catclaw acacia, mesquite, hackberry (Celtis spp.), Russian-thistle, rough pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), and sunflowers, ragweeds (Ambrosia spp.), and other Asteraceous plants. Scaled quail consume more grass seeds than do other quail species. Other dietary components include leaves, fruits, and insects. Summer diets are high in green vegetation and insects, which are also important sources of moisture. In Oklahoma, small groups of scaled quail feed among soapweed yucca and in soapweed yucca-sand sagebrush ranges, weed patches, and grain stubble. Also in Oklahoma, early winter foods apparently eaten when other foods are not available included snow-on-the-mountain (Euphorbia marginata), sand paspalum (Paspalum stramineum), field sandbur (Cenchrus pauciflorus), purslane (Portulaca spp.), skunkbush sumac, Fendler spurge (Euphorbia fendleri), and leaf bugs. Jimsonweed (Datura stramonium) and juniper berries were always avoided. Winter foods of the scaled quail in Oklahoma include Russian-thistle and sunflower (Helianthus spp.) seeds.Sutton, George Miksch. (1967). Oklahoma birds: their ecology and distribution with comments on the avifauna of the southern Great Plains. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press In northwestern Texas, selection of foods by scaled quail was dependent on foraging techniques, availability, and seed size. Small seeds were selected when they were still on the plant and could be easily stripped, but were not eaten once they had fallen, presumably because they were too small and/or too hard to find. Broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) was a staple in winter diets; it was not highly selected but was consumed in proportion to its availability (and lack of availability of choice items). Generally, in Texas grass seeds (mainly tall dropseed [Sporobolus asper] and rough tridens [Tridens muticus]) were major constituents of scaled quail diets. This was attributed to a precipitation pattern that resulted in a relatively higher amount of grass seed available, and a lower amount of available forbs. In the same study green vegetation formed a higher proportion of the diet than reported for other areas.Leif, Anthony P. (1987). Bobwhite and scaled quail responses to burning of redberry juniper- dominated rangelands. Lubbock, TX: Texas Tech University. Thesis In southwestern Texas, chestnut-bellied scaled quail consumed woody plant seeds and green vegetation. The seeds of brush species comprised 68% of the contents of 32 scaled quail crops. Green food, chiefly wild carrot (Daucus carota) and clover (Trifolium spp.) made up 7.17%. Elbowbush was the single most important source, followed by Roemer acacia (Acacia roemeriana), desert-yaupon (Schaefferia cuneifolia), and spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida). In southeastern New Mexico, staples (comprising at least 5% of scaled quail diet in both summer and winter) were mesquite and croton (Croton spp.) seeds, green vegetation, and snout beetles. Nonpreferred foods eaten in winter and available but not consumed in summer included broom snakeweed (the main winter food), crown-beard (Verbesina encelioides), cycloloma (Cycloloma atriplicifolium), and lace bugs. Mesquite seeds and broom snakeweed seeds together made up 75% of the winter diet. Grasshoppers were a summer staple. Insect galls, cicadas, scarab beetles, spurge (Euphorbia spp.), plains bristlegrass (Setaria macrostachya) seeds, and white ratany (Krameria grayi) were consumed in a less pronounced seasonal pattern. Another study reported substantial amounts of prairie sunflower seeds (Helianthus petiolaris) and pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) seeds in the diet of scaled quail. Scaled quail feed in alfalfa (Medicago spp.) fields. Predators In Arizona, potential scaled quail predators include mammals, birds, and reptiles. Most scaled quail kills are made by avian predators including northern harrier (Circus cyaneus), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American kestrel (Falco sparverius), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), and great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). In New Mexico, predators on scaled quail include hawks, owls, coyote (Canis latrans), and snakes. In Colorado, potential predators of scaled quail include coyote, gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), kit fox (V. velox), bobcat (Lynx rufus), northern harrier, rough-legged hawk (Buteo lagopus), prairie falcon, peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), American kestrel, golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), and bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).Snyder, Warren D.

The regiment existed continuously for 111 years and served in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. In 1946, due to distinguished service in World War II, the regiment was retitled as the Royal Hampshire Regiment. On 9 September 1992, after over 111 years of service, the Royal Hampshire Regiment was amalgamated with the Queen's Regiment to form a new large regiment, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, which continues the traditions of the Royal Hampshires. History =Formation and antecedents= The Hampshire Regiment was formed on 1 July 1881 under the Childers reforms from the merger of the 37th (North Hampshire) Regiment of Foot and the 67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot along with the militia and rifle volunteers of the county of Hampshire. As part of the formation of the regiment, the following Volunteer Force and Militia units were placed under command of the regiment:Frederick, pp. 250‚Äì2. * 3rd (Hampshire Militia) Battalion based in Winchester * [4th] 1st Volunteer Battalion based in Winchester, former 1st Hampshire Rifle Volunteers * [5th] 2nd Volunteer Battalion based in Southampton, former 2nd Hampshire Rifle Volunteers * [6th] 3rd Volunteer Battalion based in Portsmouth, former 3rd Hampshire Rifle Volunteers * [7th] 4th Volunteer Battalion based in Newport, former 1st Isle of Wight Rifle Volunteers =Second Boer War= At the turn of the 20th century, there were two regular battalions of the regiment. The 1st battalion was stationed at Malta from 1884, then transferred to British India where it had various postings. In early 1903 the battalion transferred from Lucknow to Aden. In April 2004 three companies were attached to the Royal Navy and saw service in the Somaliland Campaign. Landing on the Somali coast, they served alongside a naval detachment that stormed and captured the forts at Illig.\\"The capture of the forts at Illig from the Mad Mullah, 21 April 1904\\", Paul G Lane. Orders & Medals Research Society Journal (Volume 59, number 2) June 2020. pp 152-156. The 2nd Battalion was deployed to South Africa as reinforcement for the British Army during the Second Boer War in January 1900, and took part in an action at Karee Siding on 29 March 1900, when one officer and 11 troops died. The battalion served in South Africa throughout the war, which ended in June 1902 with the Peace of Vereeniging. They returned home three months later, arriving in late September 1902, and a few days after their return was entertained to a large celebratory banquet by the Mayor of Portsmouth. A third militia battalion was formed from the former Hampshire Militia, with headquarters in Winchester. The battalion was embodied in January 1900 for service in South Africa, and disembodied in December the same year. A Volunteer battalion was also formed to serve in South Africa. Men from this battalion were involved in the worst train accident during the war, near Barberton, on 30 March 1902. Following the accident, the battalion returned to the United Kingdom, arriving at Southampton in May 1902. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve battalion and five Territorial battalions.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), with the 4th Battalion at Castle Hill in Winchester, the 5th Battalion at Carlton Place in Southampton, the 6th Battalion at Stanhope Road in Portsmouth, the 7th Battalion at Holdenhurst Road in Bournemouth and the 8th Battalion at Drill Hall Road in Newport (all Territorial Force). =First World War= The SS River Clyde holds dead of the Hampshire Regiment who were killed while attempting to get ashore at Sedd el Bahr during the Gallipoli Campaign. During the First World War, the regiment expanded to 34 battalions. By the end of the First World War, the Hampshire Regiment had lost 7,580 officers and men killed in action. Regular Army The 1st Battalion was a Regular Army unit stationed in Colchester on the outbreak of war in August 1914. The battalion was assigned to the 11th Brigade, 4th Division. With the division, the battalion joined the British Expeditionary Force and was sent overseas to France in August 1914, landing at Le Havre on 23 August. The 1st Battalion saw its first combat against the German Army at Le Cateau. The battalion served on the Western Front for the rest of the war, participating in many battles in 1914 alone such as the First Battle of the Marne, the First Battle of the Aisne, and the Battle of Messines. In 1914, on Christmas Day, men of the 1st Battalion participated in the legendary Christmas Truce of 1914 where British and German soldiers fraternised in No man's land. In 1915, the battalion took part in the Second Battle of Ypres, famous for its use of poison gas. In 1916 it fought at Albert and Le Transloy, which was part of the larger Somme offensive. The 2nd Battalion was also a Regular Army battalion that was serving in India at the outbreak of war and arrived in England on 22 December 1914. In early 1915, the battalion became part of the 88th Brigade, assigned to the 29th Division. The 2nd Battalion took part in the Battle of Gallipoli when engaged in the fatal Landing at Cape Helles in April 1915 and fought in the Battle of Krithia. In 1916, the 2nd Battalion was evacuated to Alexandria due to a mixture of heavy casualties from combat, disease and the terrible weather conditions. In March 1916, the battalion was sent to France and would serve on the Western Front for the rest of the war, participating in the battle of Albert and Le Transloy rides, alongside the 1st Battalion. Territorial Force The 1/4th Battalion landed at Karachi in India in November 1914 as part of the 4th (Rawalpindi) Brigade in the 2nd (Rawalpindi) Division before moving to Basra in March 1915: it remained in Mesopotamia and Persia for the rest of the war. The 1/5th Battalion landed at Karachi in India in November 1914: it remained in India for the rest of the war. The 1/6th (Duke of Connaught's Own) Battalion landed at Karachi in India in November 1914: it remained in India for the rest of the war. The 1/7th Battalion landed at Karachi in India in November 1914: it remained in India until January 1918 when it moved to Aden. The 1/8th (Isle of Wight Rifles, Princess Beatrice's) Battalion landed at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli as part of the 163rd Brigade in the 54th (East Anglian) Division on 9 August 1915 and, having been evacuated from Gallipoli in December 1915, moved to Egypt and then to Palestine. The 1/9th (Cyclist) Battalion sailed for India in February 1916 and then to Vladivostok in October 1918. The 2/4th Battalion sailed for India in December 1914 as part of 2/1st Hampshire Brigade in the 2nd Wessex Division and then sailed for Egypt in April 1917 and to France in May 1918. The 2/5th Battalion sailed for India in December 1914 as part of 2/1st Hampshire Brigade in the 2nd Wessex Division and then sailed for Egypt in April 1917 before being disbanded in Palestine in August 1918. The 2/7th Battalion sailed for India in December 1914 as part of 2/1st Hampshire Brigade in the 2nd Wessex Division and then moved to Mesopotamia in September 1917. New Armies The 10th (Service) Battalion landed at Gallipoli in August 1915 and was then transferred to Salonika in October 1915. The 11th (Service) Battalion (Pioneers) landed at Le Havre in December 1915. The 12th (Service) Battalion landed in France in September 1915, but moved to Salonika in November 1915. The 14th (Service) Battalion (1st Portsmouth) landed at Le Havre in March 1916. The 15th (Service) Battalion (2nd Portsmouth) landed in France in May 1916. =Irish War of Independence= The 2nd Battalion was sent to Ireland to fight the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence. On 20 February 1921, soldiers from the Battalion took part in the Clonmult ambush during which the IRA suffered its greatest loss of volunteers in conflict.Tom O'Neill, The Battle of Clonmult: The IRA's Worst Defeat (Dublin: Nonsuch, 2006) Regimental historian Scott Daniell commented on the action that \\"like all the Irish operations, it was hateful to the British troops\\".Scott Daniell, p. 11 On 31 May 1921, seven soldiers, all with the band of the 2nd Battalion, Hampshire Regiment were on their way to the rifle range at Youghal County Cork when a road mine exploded under the truck they were travelling in. Three soldiers were killed outright, while a further four died later from their wounds. =Second World War= 231st Brigade of the 50th Division, crossing the Seine at Vernon, 28 August 1944. In the Second World War, the Hampshire Regiment had six battalions that fought abroad (the 1st, 2nd, 1/4th, 2/4th, 5th and 7th), whilst more battalions stayed at home. By the end of the Second World War, 2,094 officers and men of the Hampshire Regiment had lost their lives. The 1st Battalion The 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment was a Regular Army unit that was deployed on Garrison duties in El Daba, Egypt at the beginning of the war.Scott Daniell, p. 46 It moved to Palestine on peace keeping duties in December 1939 and then moved to Moascar in Egypt, then to Mearsa Matruh in Summer 1940. One of its duties was to look after the large number of Italian prisoners after the fall of Sidi Barrani.Scott Daniell, p. 50 In February 1941, the 1st Battalion arrived in Malta, where it became part of the 1st (Malta) Infantry Brigade (with 1st Dorset Regiment and 2nd Devonshire Regiment). This later became the 231st Infantry Brigade. Duties in Malta included airfield repair and working as stevedores in the docks. Malta was subjected to a prolonged siege and, by July 1942, the food situation had become serious, but the situation eased as the Allies' fortunes improved in the North African Campaign.Scott Daniell, p. 55 In April 1943, the 231st Brigade, including the 1st Hampshires, was moved to Alexandria, then subsequently to Cairo and Suez, where it trained as an independent assault brigade. Then, in July 1943, the 1st Battalion invaded Sicily as part of the first wave of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. The beach landing went smoothly, but the 1st Battalion ran into resistance at Vizzini on 13 July when it ran into the Herman Goring Parachute Panzer Division. On 22 July, the 1st Battalion was engaged in hard fighting for Agria, which only fell on 29 July. The 1st Battalion was reduced to three companies after the battle. There was further hard fighting to capture the Regalbuto Ridge, which ended the Sicilian Campaign. The 1st Battalion suffered 18 Officers and 286 Other Ranks killed or wounded in action in Sicily.Scott Daniell, p. 128 On 8 September 1943, the 231st Brigade landed in Italy, coming ashore at Potro San Venere near Pizzo. The 1st Battalion was involved in fighting as the Germans withdrew northwards. By October 1943, the 1st Battalion was back in Sicily waiting for transport back to the United Kingdom and, by November, the battalion was back in the United Kingdom for the first time in 22 years.Scott Daniell, p. 131 The battalion was allocated to the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, one of the assault divisions for the invasion of North West Europe, which had an excellent reputation after fighting in the Mediterranean theatre. On 6 June 1944, the 1st Battalion came ashore as part of Operation Overlord without any supporting tanks. Despite facing machine gun fire, the men captured Le Hamel and Arromanches after a hard fight. By the end of D-Day , the 1st Battalion had suffered 182 casualties, 64 of them being killed in action.Scott Daniell, p. 219 The Battalion started a three-week fight for the village of Hottot, against the German Panzer-Lehr-Division, in June 1944. This culminated in a major assault on 11 July. The 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line the next day, testimony to the hard fighting. The Battalion was in the vanguard of the assault towards Villiers Bocage later in the month. There were stiff fights at St Germain d‚ÄôEctot and Launay. Villiers Bocage was taken on 4 August, following which the 50th Division was taken out of the line.Scott Daniell, p. 228 In August 1944, a brigade attack was launched towards Conde, and the Battalion attacked St Pierre la Vielle. The fighting was particularly hard and, after the 11-hour battle, three of its Rifle companies were severely reduced ‚Äì ‚ÄòB‚Äô Company had 25 men, ‚ÄòC‚Äô Company had 35 men, and ‚ÄòD‚Äô Company was down to just 12 men; as ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company was only lightly engaged, it was not so depleted. On 12 August, the 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line. The Battalion was motorised and joined with the 11th Armoured Division for the breakout attack later in the month. There was no fighting and, on 31 August, the 1st Battalion crossed the river Seine at Vernon and swept on to Amiens.Scott Daniell, p. 231 The Battalion was then placed under command of the Guards Armoured Division and swept into Brussels on 3 September. The Battalion, still under command of the Guards Armoured, then started the attack towards Eindhoven, which was the attack designed to relieve the British and Polish airborne troops fighting at Arnhem, who had dropped as part of Operation Market Garden, which ended in a failure. The Battalion, as part of 231st Infantry Brigade, was charged with defending the \\"Corridor\\" formed by the armoured advance. In October, the 1st Battalion moved up to Nijmegen and moved onto \\"The Island\\", the bridgehead over the river Waal but behind the river Lek.Scott Daniell, p. 242 In October 1944, the Battalion attacked north of Bemmel, and expanded the bridgehead up to the Wettering Canal. The Battalion then went onto the defensive until the end of November. The Battalion then moved back to Ypres in Belgium, and subsequently was moved back to the United Kingdom with the rest of the 50th Division, and the men were mainly used as replacements for other infantry battalions, with the exception of a small training cadre consisting of 12 officers and 100 other ranks. The battalion ended the war in Louth, Lincolnshire.Scott Daniell, p. 244 Since D-Day, the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment had suffered over 1,281 casualties, including 231 officers and men killed in action, the rest being either wounded or missing in action.Monty's Northern Legions: 50th Northumbrian and 15th Scottish Divisions at War 1939-1945: Patrick Delaforce The 2nd Battalion The 2nd Battalion was also a Regular Army battalion and started the war in Aldershot, Hampshire, England.Scott Daniell, p. 59 In September 1939, the 2nd Battalion moved to Cherbourg, France with the 1st Guards Brigade, alongside the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards and the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, attached to 1st Infantry Division. It then moved to Sille-le-Guillaume, and from there 250 miles north to take its allocated place on the \\"Gort Line\\", which it reached on 3 October. Later that month, the Battalion moved to the Belgian/French border and, in February 1940, the Battalion spent three weeks on the Maginot Line before returning to Metz.Scott Daniell, p. 61 The Battalion crossed into Belgium in response to the German invasion of Belgium and, by 14 May, was digging into a defensive position. While an attack never came, with the retreat of the Dutch and the French Ninth Army, the 1st Division was ordered to retreat on 16 May. A slow retreat then commenced, ending at Dunkirk. The Battalion began to be embarked from Dunkirk for the United Kingdom (some were evacuated on 2 June). The battalion managed to carry away 100% of their small-arms, mortars and anti-tank rifles. It was congratulated by the Minister for War, Mr Anthony Eden. The battalion then spent two years on home defence, training and preparing for a German invasion that never arrived.Scott Daniell, p. 69 In November 1942, the Battalion, Hampshire Regiment sailed for North Africa, taking part in Operation Torch with the 1st Guards Brigade, which was now part of the 78th Infantry Division. They disembarked at Algiers on 21 November and joined the British First Army. Later that month, the Battalion moved to Tebourba.Scott Daniell, p. 89 The following day the 2nd Battalion were attacked by heavy shelling and, on 1 December, the Battalion was attacked by a force four times its size, which was able to outflank it and rake it with enfilading fire. This was the start of three days of fierce close combat, fought at close quarters and featuring bayonet charges and counter-charges. The battalion was forced back a mile and a half and, on 3 December, Major Wallace Le Patourel was awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallantry in leading counter-attacks against the enemy. After three days, the Battalion retreated through Tebourba, only to find all other troops had been withdrawn and the road behind them was cut. The battalion broke into small groups and attempted to break through to allied lines, reuniting at Medjez-el-Bab; many, including the Commanding Officer, were captured. The Battalion, which had started the battle with 689 men, was down to 194 men. The battalion was withdrawn from the line and in December, nine officers and 260 other ranks joined the 2nd Battalion.Scott Daniell, p. 99 After the fall of Tunis on 13 May 1943, the 2nd Battalion joined the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade attached to 46th (West Riding) Infantry Division.Scott Daniell, p. 118 The 128th Infantry Brigade The Hampshire Regiment had a number of Territorial Army (TA) battalions, whose ranks were swelled throughout 1939 when the TA was ordered to be doubled in size. During 1939, due to the number of new recruits, the 5/7th Battalion was split into the 5th Battalion and the 7th Battalion, and the 4th Battalion was split into the 1/4th Battalion and the 2/4th Battalion. The 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th Battalions were all grouped into the 128th Infantry Brigade (the \\"Hampshire Brigade\\") and the 7th Battalion was part of the 130th Infantry Brigade. Both brigades were part of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division.Scott Daniell, p. 75 Men of the 2/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment scale an obstacle during 'toughening up' training in wintry conditions at Wateringbury in Kent, 20 January 1942. However, on 6 June 1942, the 128th Brigade was detached from the 43rd Division until 15 August, when it was transferred to the 46th Infantry Division, where it would remain for the rest of the war. In January 1943, the brigade left Britain with the rest of the 46th Infantry Division, for North Africa, as part of Operation Torch.Scott Daniell, p. 76 The brigade disembarked at Algiers on 17 January, moving to Bone, where it remained until the end of January, when the brigade moved to Hunts Gap.Scott Daniell, p. 102 The 5th Battalion was sent 12 miles further ahead to Sidi Nsir. The 5th Battalion at Sidi N'sir was attacked in overwhelming strength in February 1943 as the Germans began Operation \\"Ox Head\\", a Corps level assault by German Paratroopers, elements of 10th Panzer Division and the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion. The 5th Battalion was supported by 155th Battery, Royal Artillery. The Germans had to take the Hampshires' hilltop positions before they could attack the artillery, knocking out all the guns, whose crews stood and died firing over open sights at the German tanks. Only nine gunners survived. At 5pm, ‚ÄòB‚Äô Company of the 5th Battalion, reduced to 30 men, was overrun. At dusk, the battalion considered its position untenable, and it withdrew to a feature known as \\"Hampshire Farm\\". Of the four Rifle Companies, only ‚ÄòC‚Äô Company, less a single platoon, and 30 men of ‚ÄòD‚Äô Company, remained. The German force was delayed for one critical day.Scott Daniell, p. 107 Later in the month, the Hampshire Brigade was attacked at Hunt's Gap by the German force that had been delayed at Sidi N'sir. 2/4th was the main Battalion engaged, with 1/4th Battalion in support. The 2/5th Leicesters was attached to the brigade as well. The situation was so precarious that the 2nd Hampshires, still training its new recruits, was put into the line alongside 1/4th Battalion. The brigade was supported by plenty of artillery and the Churchill tanks of the North Irish Horse. Extensive minefields and heavy dive bombing kept the German tanks at bay. On 28 February, a pre-dawn attack penetrated the 2/4th battalion's ‚ÄòB‚Äô Company positions, but heroic resistance and the tanks of the North Irish Horse kept the Germans at bay until dusk, when ‚ÄòB‚Äô Company was overrun. ‚ÄòC‚Äô Company was overrun by German infantry. On 1 March, the Germans attacked again, and ‚ÄòD‚Äô Company was overrun, but 2/4th Battalion hung on to their remaining positions. On 2 March, the Germans withdrew, and on 5 March the 2/4th Battalion was relieved by the 8th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of 36th Brigade of the 78th Battleaxe Division. The 2/4th Battalion had suffered 243 men killed or missing.Scott Daniell, p. 112 During March, the brigade was engaged on defensive patrolling, under heavy shelling. 1/4th Battalion lost 100 casualties during March, but 5th Battalion received 5 Officers and 150 men as replacements. On 5 April, the brigade handed over its positions and moved 100 miles south to El Ala. The 128th Brigade subsequently captured the Fondouk Gap, allowing the 6th Armoured Division to pass through and debouche onto the Kairouan Plain.Scott Daniell, p. 114 In April 1943, the 128th Infantry Brigade attacked Bou Arada. The 16th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry was added to the brigade for the attack. Five Field regiments and two Medium regiments of the Royal Artillery supported the 128th Brigade. Early progress was good, but when the mist cleared all four battalions were caught in the open under heavy fire, and losses mounted. The rifle companies of 1/4th Battalion only had 3 Officers and 80 men left between them and the 2/4th Battalion had to reorganise onto a three-company basis.Scott Daniell, p. 117 Tunis fell and the North African Campaign was over in May 1943. The 128th Infantry Brigade was reconstituted to consist of 2nd Battalion, 1/4th Battalion and 5th Battalion. The 2/4th Battalion was split into two to form two Defence Units of two Beach Groups. Their role was to protect the maintenance area of a Beach Group when it made a landing where no port was available.Scott Daniell, p. 119 The 128th Infantry Brigade was one of three British brigades that made an assault landing at Salerno in Italy as part of British X Corps under command of US Fifth Army, led by Mark Clark in September 1943. The landing was opposed by shore batteries firing shrapnel, and the beaches were raked by machine gun fire. 2nd Battalion and 1/4th Battalion made steady progress, but 5th Battalion had been landed in the wrong place and suffered heavily. A German counter-attack overran ‚ÄòB‚Äô Company and the Battalion HQ of 5th Battalion. The 5th Battalion lost 40 men killed and over 300 were wounded or taken prisoner.Scott Daniell, p. 142 On 12 September, the Germans started a general assault against the Salerno bridgehead, which made good progress; the US VI Corps were almost driven into the sea. However, the arrival of US paratroops and the British 7th Armoured Division turned the tide. The 128th Brigade was in the hills above Salerno, and the fighting was hard, but on 20 September the Germans began to withdraw northwards, and the pressure eased.Scott Daniell, p. 144 All three battalions had suffered ‚Äì 2nd Battalion suffered 304 casualties, 1/4th Battalion suffered 159 casualties and the 5th Battalion suffered 29 officer and over 400 other rank casualties.Scott Daniell, p. 146 The 128th Brigade, still part of the X Corps, moved up to the River Volturno, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. On 10 October, the 1/4th Battalion captured the town of Castel Volturno, alongside the river, and on 12 October the 1/4th made a night assault across the river, establishing a small bridgehead. The 2nd and 5th battalions moved across the river in support, but the entire 128th Brigade was soon engaged in a stiff fire-fight. The brigade advanced some 2,500 yards, and then dug in behind a canal as the Germans bought up tanks. The brigade remained in the low-lying, swampy, mosquito-ridden land between the river and the canal until the Germans withdrew due to a breakthrough elsewhere. The brigade then advanced along Route 7, meeting little resistance. The 128th Brigade was then taken out of the line for R&R.;Scott Daniell, p. 151 In November 1943, the Hampshire Brigade moved up to the River Garigliano. It was relieved on 11 January, and moved back to the River Volturno. They were selected as the Assault Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division, and trained in river crossings. Then, in January 1944, the Hampshire Brigade made a night assault across the swift flowing River Garigliano. The brigade had severe problems getting the boats through the minefields down to the river, and in the darkness confusion reigned. Only a few men managed to get across, and these were withdrawn at daylight. The Hampshire Brigade then assaulted Monte Damiano, a bare, razor-backed feature, already strewn with British dead from 56th (London) Infantry Division. The assault was made by the 1/4th and 2nd battalions in daylight, and immediately came under heavy mortar and machine- gun fire. The attack was made with great dash, but it failed, with heavy casualties.Scott Daniell, p. 157 The 5th Battalion was put under the command of the 138th Infantry Brigade, part of the 46th Division, to assault Mounts Ornito and Cerasola in February 1944. The assault met little opposition, although the Germans put in spirited counter-attacks on Mount Ornito, which were all driven off. However, as the days passed, the casualties mounted from heavy shelling; the bare rock made cover difficult. In eight days, the 5th Battalion suffered 200 casualties. Supply was particularly difficult, as supplies had to be carried up by mules and porters for 3 to 4 hours from the nearest road. On 7 February, the 5th Battalion attacked Mount Cerasola, a successful assault. On 10 February, the 5th Battalion was relieved.Scott Daniell, p. 161 The Hampshire Brigade was relieved later in the month. It moved south to Naples and, on 16 March, sailed for Egypt, and subsequently moved to Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and back to Egypt. All battalions were brought up to strength, largely from gunners from disbanded Middle-East Anti- Aircraft units who were retrained as infantrymen. On 27 June, the 128th Brigade sailed from Alexandria, and subsequently landed in Taranto. The move north through Italy was at an easy pace.Scott Daniell, p. 185 In August 1944, the 128th Brigade started its assault on the \\"Gothic Line\\", a line of German defences across the Etruscan Apennines. The Hampshire brigade, with the North Irish Horse under command, led the 46th Division's assault (along with the 46th Reconnaissance Regiment). The brigade's first target was to cross the River Metauro and take Monte Bartolo. The assault went to plan against little opposition, and Mount Bartolo was captured by the morning of 29 August. The brigade had marched 25 miles to cover 12 miles as the crow flies, and climbed 1,500 feet. Only the 1/4th Battalion had come across serious opposition, engaging in heavy fighting around Montegaudio. Later in the month the brigade assaulted the Gothic Line proper, crossing the River Foglia and assaulting Monte Gridolfo. This was heavily defended, with all cover cleared from its bare slopes. Nevertheless, the men of the 2nd Battalion assaulted them with great vigour, and by dawn on 31 August they had captured the first crest. The 1/4th Battalion passed through, driving deeper into Gothic Line. During this assault, Lieutenant Gerard Norton was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 1 September, the 5th Battalion took the lead, and by 2 September had captured Meleto. The Gothic Line had been breached. A fighting advance continued northwards. On 5 September the 128th Brigade was relieved, and sent to the rear for rest, but they were back in the line by 11 September.Scott Daniell, p. 191 The 128th Brigade began an assault on Montescudo in September 1944. Montescudo was defended by the German 100th Mountain Regiment, and they put up a desperate resistance. Other elements of the Brigade assaulted Trarivi, which was captured by 16 September. On 18 September, the brigade was relieved. All three battalions were short of men, even after replacements were received from the 1st Battalion, Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment). The Hampshire Brigade crossed the River Fiumicino, and then the Rubicon. The weather was atrocious, and movement was slowed by deep mud, and supply was difficult. Fighting continued until 9 October. A steady advance was made, and by 12 November the River Montone was crossed; on 26 November the River Lamone was reached. This was crossed on 3 December in the face of stiff opposition, and by 6 December the Brigade had captured Casa Nova. The Brigade was relieved the following day, and moved well to the rear. From 24 August (when the 128th Brigade moved up to the Gothic Line) to 7 December, when they were relieved, the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade had suffered 1,276 casualties.Scott Daniell, p. 203 In January 1945 the 2nd Battalion and the 5th Battalion embarked from Taranto and disembarked in Piraeus, Greece, two days later. 1/4th Battalion arrived on 22 January. The 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (now known as \\"Tigerforce\\") split its battalions, and set about disarming the E.L.A.S Army. The troops were welcomed everywhere, and there was no fighting. Then, in April 1945, the brigade began to return to Italy for the final offensive. By 1 May, the brigade was back in the line around Forlimpopoli; but the war ended before the brigade was in action again.Scott Daniell, p. 210 The 2/4th Battalion The 20th Beach Group (\\"A\\" and \\"B\\" companies) invaded Sicily as part of Operation Husky in July 1943. The role of the Beach Group was to land supplies until a harbour could be captured. On 12 July, 20 Beach Group moved inland, behind the advancing infantry, but by 22 July the half-battalion was in the line, capturing Mount Scalpello. On 4 August, the half-battalion moved to Catania, where it remained on garrison duty.Scott Daniell, p. 133 In September 1943, the 21st Beach Group (\\"C\\" and \\"D\\" companies) invaded Salerno. The assault went in at dawn against stiff opposition and, rather than take its allotted role, the half-battalion was moved straight into the line. However, there was little action until 13 September, when the half-battalion was attacked by armoured half-tracks. This happened again on 15 September when ‚ÄòD‚Äô Company was overrun. However, the half-tracks didn't assault ‚ÄòD‚Äô Company as such, they ran over the slit trenches until picked off by 6pdr anti-tank guns. On 17 September, the half-battalion was moved back into reserve and, by 23 September, it was back on the beaches unloading cargo.Scott Daniell, p. 136 In November 1943, the two halves of the 2/4th Battalion were re-united at Pontecagnano near Salerno. However, there was no immediate employment, and orders were received to send cadres to the three battalions in the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (this was rescinded after protests). However, six officers and 77 other ranks were posted away to form the \\"2/4th Hampshire Training Centre\\", three officers and 188 other ranks were assigned to ‚Äòporterage duties‚Äô and a detachment of 50 men was assigned to help the Provost Corps with traffic duties.Scott Daniell, p. 137 The Battalion was back in the line in Italy, near Garigliano, as part of 28th Infantry Brigade, in 4th Infantry Division in February 1944. This was the same ground where the Hampshire Brigade had suffered through the Italian winter. The battalion was relieved for short periods on a regular basis before returning to the line. In May 1944, the Battalion assisted the Brigade's two other battalions (2nd King's and 2nd Somersets) in crossing the River Rapido as part of the assault on Monte Cassino. The river and bank were under intense enemy fire, and the river so swift that swimmers from 2/4th had to cross with lines to enable the boats to get across. Troops got across the river, but could make little headway against the storm of machine gun fire. The 2/4th could not get across to join their fellow battalions, and so, on 12 May, it came under command of 12th Infantry Brigade and crossed via a bridge on 13 May. Supported by the 17th/21st Lancers's Sherman tanks, the 2/4th Battalion attacked along the river, taking 200 prisoners. On 14 May, back in the 28th Brigade, the 2/4th attempted to cross the River Pioppeta. The tank bridge sank in the mud, and the battalion took 100 casualties in two minutes. The 2/4th waded the river and, in spite of heavy casualties and fierce resistance, the advance continued. During this advance, Captain Richard Wakeford was awarded the Victoria Cross. By 6.30pm, all objectives had been captured, and the 2/4th reorganised on a three-company basis. On 16 May, the battalion was relieved. Two days later, Cassino was captured by the Polish II Corps.Scott Daniell, p. 171 In June 1944, the Battalion was back in the line near the village of Villastrada, between Lake Chiusi and Lake Trasimeno to north of Rome. On 24 June, a major attack was launched on that section of the Trasimene Line by 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry supported by the tanks of the 12th Canadian Armoured Regiment. 2/4th Hampshires was to follow on, but its entry into battle was delayed until the next day. Having passed through the village of Vaiano, which was unoccupied, an attack was launched on a ridge being held by the German 1st Parachute Division. Although \\"C\\" Company established a foothold on the ridge, occupying a farmhouse, that night a fierce German counter-attack was made by the Germans, who overran the company headquarters. Fighting was close and confused, and the company ran low on ammunition. It was forced back to literally the last ditch, but hung on. At dawn the next day, 26 June, the battalion counter-attacked and managed to recapture its previous positions; the Germans were withdrawing to the Arezzo Line. The 2/4th Battalion followed up, coming into action again on 21 July. Supported by the North Irish Horse, a steady advance was made. The 2/4th Battalion was then taken out of the line again ‚Äì some platoons were down to ten men each with no officer.Scott Daniell, p. 176 The Battalion then attacked Santa Lucia, which was captured on 30 July 1944 after a small but fierce battle. The enemy then withdrew, and the Battalion moved up to the River Arno. On 10 August, the battalion was withdrawn. In September 1944, the Battalion began its assault on the Gothic Line, attacking across the River Marano and capturing Casa Bagli. All the first day objectives were achieved, and the 2/4th defended them on 16 September against German counter-attacks. On 17 September, the battalion captured Cerasola; it was relieved the following day. The battalion then moved north behind the British Eighth Army‚Äôs advance, arriving in time to stand by to support the Hampshire Brigade's assault on Forli during November. During 22 November, the 2/4th attacked and captured a bridgehead over the River Cosina against heavy shelling; this was the battalion's last action in Italy.Scott Daniell, p. 183 In December 1944, the Battalion was flown to Greece in the bomb-bays of Wellington and Liberator bombers in response to the outbreak of the Greek Civil War, arriving on 12 December. The E.L.A.S. Army, armed and trained by the British, was trying to overthrow the Greek Government. On arrival, the 2/4th Battalion was split up, primarily defending the airfield, then clearing E.L.A.S. forces from Athens. This did involve some fighting, and the 2/4th Battalion lost three men killed. The 2/4th Battalion then settled down to peace-keeping duties. In May 1945, the Battalion was moved to Crete to take charge of the Germans, who had surrendered, and they ended the war there.Scott Daniell, p. 209 The 7th Battalion The 7th Battalion was a Territorial Army unit, originally the 5/7th Battalion until it was split into the 5th and 7th battalions when the Territorial Army was doubled in size in the spring and summer of 1939. The 7th Battalion remained in the United Kingdom training long and hard for many years until after the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944.Scott Daniell, p. 78 The Battalion was sent to Normandy as reinforcements with the 130th Infantry Brigade attached to the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. In June 1944, the Battalion landed near Le Hamel. They were with 130th Brigade (with 4th and 5th Dorsets) and were initially held in reserve. The Battalion attacked Maltot, supported by tanks of 9th Royal Tank Regiment (9th RTR) in July 1944. The village was defended by Waffen-SS troops supported by Tiger tanks. Both the 7th Battalion and 9th RTR suffered severe casualties, and although the 7th Battalion managed to fight its way into the village it was withdrawn. The 7th Battalion suffered 18 officer and 208 other rank casualties, including 4 officers and 12 other ranks killed, but was back in the line two days later.Scott Daniell, p. 233 The Battalion attacked the village of Cahagnes later in the month. This was fought in typical ‚Äòbocage‚Äô countryside, but after the initial attack by the brigade ran into difficulties, 7th Battalion deployed from reserves and captured Cahagnes, beating off several German counter-attacks. On 2 August, the battalion moved up to Jurques, and after a short stiff fight advanced to \\"Point 132\\", close to Mount Pincon. On 6 August, the battalion put in a deceptive attack on Mount Pincon, making a diversion whilst 129th Infantry Brigade made a flank attack. During heavy fighting, 'C' Company incurred many casualties, including all the officers. Following the successful flank attack by the 129th Brigade, the 7th Battalion mopped up and concentrated near Mauny by 10 August.Scott Daniell, p. 237 In August 1944, the Battalion captured St Denis de Mere after a bombardment by nine artillery regiments. The Battalion took 74 prisoners and then prepared for \\"The Breakout\\". The Battalion then moved 50 miles north-east to Conches and, by 27 August, the 7th Battalion was across the River Seine. The battalion then participated in the capture of Tilly, and thereafter spent 11 days taking in replacements and resting. In September 1944, the Battalion started to move to Brussels for temporary garrison duty, arriving the next day. This easy duty was welcome; since landing in Normandy in June, the 7th Hampshires had lost (including wounded) 35 officers and 450 other ranks.Scott Daniell, p. 239 The Battalion fought in Operation Market Garden in September 1944. On 20 September, the battalion moved through Eindhoven to Grave. The battalion was tasked with defending the southern end of the two large bridges over the Waal. On 23 September, the 7th was sent into the line, fighting west of the bridges in the Valburg-Elst area. It then moved to the \\"Island\\" and stayed there until 4 October, before moving to the Groesbeek-Mook area on the Dutch-German border.Scott Daniell, p. 247 In November 1944, the Battalion was moved to Maastricht, and then moved around as divisional reserve. On 19 December, the German launched their Ardennes offensive, which caused the 7th Battalion to move north of Liege to guard the bridges over the Meuse. On 26 December, the 7th Battalion moved to Aachen, and on 12 January moved again to Teveren. Then, in January 1945, the Battalion captured Putt, then Waldenrath, and on 25 January captured Dremmen and Porselen. The Battalion advanced south- east from Cleves as part of the big Reichwald offensive. Over two days fighting for Berkhofel, the 7th lost 70 casualties. It was relieved on 17 February.Scott Daniell, p. 250 The Battalion crossed the Rhine in assault craft, consolidating on the far bank and then advancing across the IJssel Canal to Milligen, which was captured on 26 March. German resistance was collapsing, and the 7th moved over the Twente Canal on 1 April, liberating Hengelo. In April 1945, the 7th Battalion took part in operation \\"Forward On\\", sweeping through Germany against minimal resistance. However, on 13 April, the Battalion had a hard fight for Cloppenburg, a fight that was as hard as any they had fought, vicious hand-to-hand fighting from street to street. Luckily, they were supported by tanks, sappers of the Royal Engineers and a single Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers, which demolished several buildings with its petard. Cloppenburg was captured the next day. Then, in April, the Battalion embarked on its final advance, moving through Bahlum, Bremen, then Bremerhavan, capturing hundreds then thousands of prisoners. The 7th Battalion reached Gnarrenburg on 3 May, and were still there when the Germans surrendered the following day.Scott Daniell, p. 272 The Home Based Battalions Although the Hampshire Regiment sent six battalions overseas, many more stayed at home as training units or were converted to other roles. Before the war, the 6th Battalion (Duke of Connaught's Own), Hampshire Regiment was converted into the 59th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, and upon the Territorial Army being doubled in size in 1939, formed a 2nd Line duplicate. The 59th Anti-Tank Regiment served with the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division and went with them to Normandy. The original 8th Battalion (Isle of Wight Rifles), Hampshire Regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery and made into an artillery battery in 1937. However, a new 8th Battalion was formed, shortly after the war began, at Southampton in December 1939. It subsequently split into the 1/8th and 2/8th Battalions, before the 2/8th Battalion was renamed the 13th Battalion, and then both battalions were re- formed into the 8th Battalion again, which was subsequently renumbered the 30th Battalion and was disbanded in September 1942.Scott Daniell, p. 79 The 9th Battalion was formed on the Isle of Wight in July 1940 and was later assigned to the 201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). In 1942, the battalion was converted to armour as the 157th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps and assigned to 36th Army Tank Brigade. Units converted in this way continued to wear their infantry cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.George Forty (1998), \\"British Army Handbook 1939‚Äì1945\\", Stoud: Sutton Publishing, pp. 50‚Äì1. However, the brigade was disbanded in July 1943 and 157 RAC was broken up in August, without having seen active service.Scott Daniell, p. 81 The 10th Battalion was formed in Aldershot in July 1940; it was assigned to the 201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), alongside the 9th Battalion. In 1941, the 10th Hampshire was also transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, becoming the 147th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, and was assigned to the 34th Army Tank Brigade.Forty pp. 50‚Äì1. Its Churchill tanks were named after Hampshire Regiment battles (the CO‚Äôs tank was called \\"Minden\\"). The regiment went to serve with distinction with 34th Tank Brigade in the North West Europe Campaign at Normandy, Le Havre, the Reichswald Forest and Operation Plunder from 1944 to 1945 .Forty p. 345.

The 50th (Holding) Battalion, which was formed on the Isle of Wight in June 1940, absorbed the Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey. The Jersey Militia subsequently became the 11th Battalion, whilst the rest of the 50th Battalion became the 12th Battalion. The 11th Battalion stayed in the United Kingdom as a training battalion until the war ended, first with the 209th Brigade and later with the 135th Brigade, 45th (Holding) Division. The 12th Battalion also stayed in the United Kingdom, with the 136th Brigade, but was disbanded in September 1944 after sending a large final draft to the 7th Battalion serving in North-west Europe.Scott Daniell, p. 84 In September 1940, the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was formed in Southampton, but soon moved to Basingstoke. It was raised for those soldiers around the age of 18 or 19 who had volunteered for the Army but were not old enough to be conscripted, the age being 20 at the time. However, the battalion was disbanded in July 1943 as the British government lowered the age of conscription for the British Armed Forces from 20 to 18. The Hampshire Regiment's Depot had been in Winchester since long before the Second World War. However, in September 1939, it moved to Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, where it stayed for the rest of the war. =Post war and amalgamation= In 1946, the regiment was awarded the title of Royal Hampshire Regiment in recognition of its service during the Second World War.Army Order 167/1946 The regiment was in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) in 1972 and undertook a further eight tours over the next two decades.

Comprehensive emergency management is the philosophy that gave birth to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the eventual decline of the term civil defense in the United States. Under Comprehensive Emergency Management, attention is given to the full range of emergencies from small weather incidents to the \\"ultimate emergency\\" of war. Its \\"all-hazards\\" philosophy stands in contrast to previous state and federal emergency management that focused solely on a massive nuclear war with the Soviet Union. For any local or state jurisdiction, Comprehensive Emergency Management involves the creation of an emergency management plan, typically an Emergency Operations Plan that provides for the activation of an Incident Command System as a flexible central command structure for in-coming and committed resources that required to deal with all aspects of the incident as an emergency situation. Other command-level constructs include multiagency coordination and public information systems; overall, the federal command construct for Comprehensive Emergency Management is the National Incident Management System (NIMS).

She was the stepmother of the founding emperor, Emperor Wu (Liu Yu). Liu Yu's mother Zhao Anzong (Ë∂ôÂÆâÂÆó) died on the same day that she gave birth to him, in 363. His father Liu Qiao (ÂäâÁøπ) later married Xiao Wenshou, although the date of the marriage is not known. She bore Liu Qiao two sons, Liu Daolian (ÂäâÈÅìÊÜê) and Liu Daogui (ÂäâÈÅìË¶è). Liu Yu was described to be highly deferential and respectful to her, as she was the only mother he knew. After he overthrew Huan Xuan, who seized the Jin Dynasty (265-420) throne in 403, he was created the Duke of Yuzhang, and she was honored as the Duchess Dowager of Yuzhang in 412. After he was created the Prince of Song in 419, she was honored as princess dowager. After he seized the Jin throne and established Liu Song in 420, she was honored as the empress dowager. By this point, Liu Yu was himself quite advanced in age (57), but he was described as so careful and so loving to her that he visited her every day without ceasing. After he died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Shao of Liu Song in 422, she was honored as grand empress dowager. She died in 423, and, pursuant to instructions that both she and Emperor Wu left, she was buried at the same site as Liu Qiao but not in the same tomb, as it would be difficult to conduct an imperial burial in the small tomb that Liu Qiao was buried.

He was a paternal first cousin once removed and a close companion of the young Ibn Saud, founder of the modern Saudi Arabia. He accompanied Ibn Saud in exile to Kuwait after the family's retreat from the capital at Riyadh. Abdullah bin Jiluwi was a principal supporter in the raid on the Masmak Castle on 15 January 1902 which resulted in the recovery of Riyadh. He killed Ajlan, the Rashidi governor, and saved the life of Ibn Saud in the battle for the fortress. In addition, he was Ibn Saud's deputy commander and assisted him in capturing the Eastern Province in 1913. As the Saudi state was founded and consolidated, Abdullah bin Jiluwi was first appointed governor of Al Ahsa and then governor of the Qassim province. Then he was transferred to the Eastern province or the Hasa province, name of the region at that period. Because Abdullah bin Jiluwi could not claim to the succession and Ibn Saud's sons were not old enough to assume this responsibility. However, Abdullah was the second powerful member of the Al Sauds during this time after the King himself. The province was ruled sternly and became almost a semi-independent family fiefdom. Abdullah's son Saud succeeded as governor upon his death in 1938. Saud bin Abdullah served as the governor from 1938 to 1967. Next, his another son Abdul Muhsin bin Abdullah Al Jiluwi served as the governor of the province from 1967 to 1985 until Prince Muhammed bin Fahd replaced him in the post.

It was established in 1975 by a group of professors and graduate students at Carleton University. Riding a wave of cultural nationalism, founders Robin Mathews, Larry McDonald, Bill Law, Greg Reid and Lois Shannon envisioned a theatre company that would produce only Canadian plays, especially those with social and political relevance. Driven by a dream to place Canadian stories and Canadian history front and centre in our country‚Äôs universities and theatres, the company launched its first production in August 1975. The group has its origins in a season of Canadian theatre produced by the Sock 'n' Buskin Theatre Company at Carleton University. From Carleton, the company moved to a converted firehall in Ottawa South (presently the Ottawa South Community Centre) and then, in 1982, to the Gladstone Theatre on Gladstone Avenue. In September 2007 the company moved into a larger venue called the Irving Greenberg Theatre Centre. The Irving Greenberg Theatre Centre, which includes a 262-seat mainstage theatre, a flexible black box studio theatre, and two spacious lobbies, has allowed GCTC to expand its community-based activities. More than 35,000 people visit the Irving Greenberg Theatre Centre every year to see productions by GCTC and other live performing arts companies, for concerts such as the Acoustic Waves music series, to visit the Lorraine Fritzi Yale Art Gallery, rent the facility, or to enjoy local homemade fare at the Viva Loca Caf√©.

Beginning in 1998, at one point he had amassed the largest steel and iron empire in Russia, which employed 125,000 people, controlling about 22 percent of the country's total steel output with an annual turnover of $20 billion. A business partner and ally of Aleksandr Frolov and Roman Abramovich, Abramov was in January 2020 listed by Forbes as having an estimated net worth of $6.1 billion. Education He graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.DMCP graduates. Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology Class of 1982 Career EvrazHolding is a product of Russia's growth since the 1998 financial crisis and Abramov is representative of the second wave of Russian magnates who went into business after the best assets had been taken. Unlike the first wave of politically connected oligarchs, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Vladimir Potanin, Abramov had neither political leverage nor financial resources to help him benefit from Russia's chaotic privatisation of the 1990s. In recent years Evraz-Holding has emerged as one of the most aggressive vertically integrated business groups in Russia. Its assets include three large steel mills, three coal mines and several ore-enriching plants, as well as a large commercial port, Nakhodka, in the east of the country. Commercial entrepreneurship =Trading= He used his contacts with Russia's steel mills, which used high- temperature technologies, and offered his services not as a scientist but as a metal trader. Trading was a popular and quick way to make money in Russia in the early 1990s. The economy was shrinking, non-payment was a chronic problem and any offer of cash from a trader was welcomed by factories. By 1997, trading was less profitable and many trading companies, including Abramov's, were owed large sums by producers. Abramov began buying factories and swapped debt for equity in the Nizhny Tagil steel mill, while also buying stakes in its rail-producing plant from other shareholders. =Acquisitions, monopolies and factories= While the first wave of Russian oligarchs grabbed whatever assets they could, Mr Abramov acquired them in a much more focused way. He decided to build a monopoly for rail and steel construction products and looked for factories that would give him synergies. The only other big factories making these products were in the industrial region of Kemerovo, also home to Russia's largest coalmines. Using his old trading contacts with coalmine bosses, Abramov was introduced to Aman Tuleev, populist governor of the region. =Pitching job creation in the vacuum of bankrupt factories= The two factories Abramov was interested in were in bankruptcy in 1998. Salaries had not been paid for up to eight months and strikes were breaking out. The deal: managers for factories Tuleev needed good managers. Abramov needed the two factories and soon a deal was made. As a state creditor, Tuleev would help appoint external managers loyal to EvrazHolding to run the steel mills. Abramov would pay salaries and taxes, guarantee jobs and support Tuleev's social projects. Competition against Alfa Group This pitched Abramov against Alfa Group, one of the most influential oligarch groups, which controlled one of the factories. While groups such as Alfa were shedding non-core assets, Abramov and his like were building empires.The science of forging a steel empire, Financial Times (UK), 27 August 2003 In June 2005 EvrazHolding was listed on the London Stock Exchange. Five months later, Abramov resigned as group president but remains a member of the board. Acquisitions He has made numerous strategic business acquisitions. For example, in 2007 Abramov acquired Oregon Steel Mills and Claymont Steel.

Gilbert and Gubar draw their title from Charlotte Bront√´'s Jane Eyre, in which Rochester's wife (n√©e Bertha Mason) is kept secretly locked in an attic apartment by her husband. The text The text specifically examines Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Charlotte and Emily Bront√´, George Eliot, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti and Emily Dickinson. In the work, Gilbert and Gubar examine the notion that women writers of the nineteenth century were confined in their writing to make their female characters either embody the \\"angel\\" or the \\"monster\\", a struggle which they argue stemmed from male writers' tendencies to categorize female characters as either pure, angelic women or rebellious, unkempt madwomen. In their argument Gilbert and Gubar point to Virginia Woolf, who says women writers must \\"kill the aesthetic ideal through which they themselves have been 'killed' into art\\".The Madwoman in the Attic by Sandra Gilbert and Susan GubarWoolf, Virginia. \\"Professions for Women,\\" The Death of the Moth and Other Essays. Harcourt, 1942, pp. 236-8. While it may be easy to construe that feminist writers embody the \\"madwoman\\" or \\"monster\\", Gilbert and Gubar stress the importance of killing off both figures because neither accurately represents women or women writers. Instead, Gilbert and Gubar urge female writers to strive for autonomous self-definition beyond this dichotomy, which they see as imposed by a reductionist patriarchal view of women's roles. They also explore the way women were inhibited in their writing by what they called the Anxiety of Authorship ‚Äì the lack of legitimating role-models for the nineteenth-century woman writer.J. Childers ed. 'The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 14 One result was what they identified as the literary palimpsest or double-voiced text ‚Äì one with a feminist subtext hidden within a more conventional narrative, so that \\"surface designs conceal or obscure deeper, less socially acceptable levels of meaning\\".Quoted in J. Childers ed. 'The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 218 Feminist criticism Over 700 pages long, the work is an early landmark in feminist literary criticism.K. Hall, Feminist Disability Studies (2011) p. 91 While some would argue that it has become outdated, and that the metaphoric framework outlined by Gilbert and Gubar is limiting, essentialist and insufficiently aware of the varying individual circumstances,F. O'Gorman ed., The Victorian Novel (2008) p.85 it remains an important and influential (if not foundational) feminist work.H.

However, as the content of the natural Os-Ir alloys varies considerably, the constituent percentages of specimens often reflects the reverse situation of osmiridium describing specimens containing a higher proportion of osmium and iridosmine specimens containing more iridium.  Nomenclature  In 1963, M. H. Hey proposed using iridosmine for hexagonal specimens with 32% < Os < 80%, osmiridium for cubic specimens with Os < 32% and native osmium for specimens Os > 80% (the would-be mineral native iridium of >80% purity was not known at that time). In 1973, Harris and Cabri defined the following names for Os-Ir-Ru alloys: ruthenosmiridium was applied to cubic Os-Ir-Ru alloys, where Ir < 80% of (Os+Ir+Ru) and Ru > 10% of (Os+Ir+Ru) with no single other element >10% of the total; Rutheniridosmine was applied to cubic Os-Ir-Ru alloys, where Os < 80% of (Os+Ir+Ru) and Ru is 10‚Äì80% of (Os+Ir+Ru) with no single other element >10% of the total; the Ru-Os alloys be known as ruthenian osmium (>50% Os), osmian ruthenium (>50% Ru); the Ru-Ir alloys be known as iridian ruthenium and ruthenian iridium where the boundary between them is defined by the alloy's miscibility gap (a minimum 57% Ir for ruthenian iridium and a minimum of 55% Ru for iridian ruthenium). The nomenclature of Os-Ir-Ru alloys were revised again by Harris and Cabri in 1991. Afterwards, only four names were applied to minerals whose compositions lie within the ternary Os-Ir-Ru system: osmium (native osmium) for all hexagonal alloys with Os the major element; iridium (native iridium) for all cubic alloys with iridium the major element; rutheniridosmine for all hexagonal alloys with Ir the major element; and ruthenium (native ruthenium) for all hexagonal alloys with Ru the major element. The mineral names iridosmine, osmiridium, rutheniridosmium, ruthenian osmium, osmian ruthenium, ruthenium iridium and iridian ruthenium were proposed to be retired.  Related compounds  Natural alloys also occur in the systems Ir-Os-Rh, Os-Ir- Pt, Ru-Ir-Pt, Ir-Ru-Rh and Pd-Ir-Pt. Names used in these systems have included platiniridium (or platinian iridium) and iridrhodruthenium. However, there is no universally accepted method of plotting these compositions and their names, especially in the ternary systems.  Properties  The properties of all these alloys generally fall between those of the members, but hardness is greater than the individual constituents. Occurrence Os-Ir alloys are very rare, but can be found in mines of other platinum-group metals. One very productive mine was operated at Adamsfield near Tyenna in Tasmania during the Second World War with the ore shipped out by railway from Maydena. The site of the mine is now totally reclaimed by dense natural bush. It was once one of the world's major producers of this rare metal, and the osmiridium was mostly found in shallow alluvial workings.Bottrill, R. S.; 1989, Economic Geology Appendix A; Tasmanian Geol. Surv. Explanatory Rept. 73 ( Huntley.) Cited at Adamsfield, Tasmania, Australia. Mindat.org. Accessed May 5, 2010. The element is currently valued at about US$400 per troy ounce. Isolation It can be isolated by adding a piece to aqua regia, which has the ability to dissolve gold and platinum but not osmiridium. It occurs naturally as small, extremely hard, flat metallic grains with hexagonal crystal structure.

The firm's major works in the domains of municipal, commercial, and residential architecture reflect a modernist aesthetic and a focus on user needs, geographic context, and ecological sustainability. The firm has received many awards acknowledging its innovative \\"green\\" design approach and its contribution to the continued development of Pacific Northwest regional architecture.  History  Miller Hull was founded in 1977 after the dissolution of Rhone & Iredale, the Vancouver-based firm for which both future partners worked. The firm's first office was located in Seattle's Smith Tower. Early projects, such as a water quality testing lab in Seattle, Seattle Community College's Marine Technology Facility, and several earth-sheltered houses, demonstrated the architects' interests in resource conservation and innovative use of off-the-shelf materials to keep project costs within budget. 70% of the firm's projects involve public funding. The architects credit their economical, sustainable, and regionalist approach to building to their time in the US Peace Corps in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Miller in Brazil, and Hull in Afghanistan. Founding partner Robert Hull died in 2014. During Hull's lifetime, the two architects traditionally worked in collaboration‚Äîone partner birthing an idea, and the other refining. In 2015, the firm employed 40 architects, 8 partners, 6 principals, and 8 associates, and had offices in Seattle and San Diego. = Awards and honors = In addition to numerous publications, they are the recipients of the 2003 American Institute of Architects Architecture Firm Award, the AIA's highest honor.

Career Dorson was born in New York City into a wealthy Jewish family. He studied at the Phillips Exeter Academy from 1929 to 1933.Guide to the Richard Dorson papers in the Lilly Library. Indiana University. URL accessed April 22, 2006. He then went on to Harvard University where he earned his A.B., M.A., in history, and his Ph.D. degree in the History of American Civilization in 1942. He began teaching as an instructor of history at Harvard in 1943. He moved to Michigan State University in 1944 staying there until 1957 when he took a position at Indiana University as professor of history and folklore as well as that of chairman of the Committee on Folklore. He taught at Indiana until his death. He was the general editor of the \\"Folktales of the World\\" (1963‚Äì1973), a multivolume series published by the University of Chicago Press. He served an advisory editor of the series \\"International Folklore\\" (48 vols., 1977), as well as the series editor of \\"Folklore of the World\\" (38 vols., 1980). In addition, he contributed articles to numerous scholarly and popular periodicals. From 1957 to 1962 he edited the Journal of Folklore Research. He was elected president of the American Folklore Society, 1966 to 1968. In addition, he was the founder and editor of the journal of the Folklore Institute (1963‚Äì1981) at Indiana. Keene, 2010.

That study, according to Dorson, involved several roles; \\"polemicist, critic, field collector, library scholar\\".Dorson, p. vii Dorson also wrote that \\"no subject of study in the United States today [1976] is more misunderstood than folklore\\".Dorson, p. 1 Contributions to folklore Dorson contributed two terms to the study of folklore that have gained common currency. The first is \\"urban legend\\"; meaning a modern \\"story which never happened told for true\\".Straight Dope Science Advisory Board. What's so urban about urban legends?. Straight Dope. URL accessed April 21, 2006. Dorson also coined the word \\"fakelore\\" in a debate with author James Stevens.Dorson, p. 5 Dorson dismissed Stevens' book on Paul Bunyan, and the later work of Ben Botkin as fakelore, or \\"a synthetic product claiming to be authentic oral tradition but actually tailored for mass edification\\", which \\"misled and gulled the public\\". Dorson's fieldwork touched upon African- American folklore in Michigan, folklore of the Upper Peninsula, other regional folklore in the United States, the folklore of Japan, and other topics. Among other academic recognitions, Dorson was awarded the Library of Congress award in History of American Civilization in 1946, and three Guggenheim Fellowships (1949, 1964, and 1971). In 2003, the Michigan Traditional Arts Program of the Michigan State University Museum awarded him the Michigan Heritage Award posthumously for his Michigan-based fieldwork contributions. According to Anne Keene, at Indiana: :Dorson gained international recognition as the dean of American folklife studies and was credited with transforming folklore from a field of tangential interest to a scholarly discipline in its own right. He was an intense and prodigious researcher and writer with seemingly boundless energy, devoted to the study of what he termed ‚Äúthe underculture, in contrast with the elite, the uppercrust, the official, the formal culture.‚Äù Dorson viewed himself, first and foremost, as a historian, and he was suspicious of attempts by other disciplines‚Äîanthropology, sociology, and psychology, among others‚Äîto co-opt folk culture for their own theoretical purposes. Folklore, he argued, was firmly rooted in human history and should be studied empirically as a means of expanding knowledge of that history; to that end, he repeatedly emphasized the necessity for the accurate collection and documentation of folk materials. At a time when quasi-legendary American folk heroes like Davy Crockett and Paul Bunyan were increasingly being popularized and commercialized by the mass media, Dorson placed himself squarely in opposition to what he termed ‚Äúfakelore,‚Äù what might be called the Disneyfication of folk traditions; he dismissed anything he suspected of being less than genuine. That attitude extended to the so-called folk-music revival of the mid- twentieth century‚Äîto the mock dismay of many of his guitar-picking students.Keene, 2010. According to William Wilson: :Dorson, in much the same manner as European romantic-nationalistic folklorists, set himself the patriotic task of discovering and making known the genius of his country's national spirit. Throughout his research career, Dorson moved freely across space and time--from the United States and England to Africa and Japan, from the religious narratives of the Puritans to the urban legends of college students, from international folktales of the world to the personal experience narratives of Indiana steelworkers. But from his early writings on Davy Crockett and Brother Jonathan to his final book on fabulous men and beasts in American comic legends, the work which clearly seemed closest to his heart was the romantic-nationalistic attempt to discover in American folklore those traits and sentiments that are peculiarly and uniquely American.William A. Wilson, \\"Richard M. Dorson as Romantic-Nationalist.\\" Journal of Folklore Research (1989) p. 35. Bibliography Dorson's papers are held at the Lilly Library of Indiana University. Audio recordings from his fieldwork can be found at the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University.

The House of Dies Drear is the first book in the Dies Drear Chronicles; the second is The Mystery of Drear House (1987). Synopsis The story is set in Ohio, in 1968. Summary Thomas Small is a 13-year old African American boy, who has moved with his family from North Carolina to Ohio. His father is a history professor who has leased the historic home of the abolitionist Dies Drear. The house has been mostly empty for years, and is riddled with hidden passageways that were used to hide escaping slaves on the Underground Railroad. An elderly caretaker, named Mr. Pluto, lives in a cave on the property, which he has converted into a home. There are rumors that the house is haunted by the ghosts of two escaped slaves who were captured and killed, and by the ghost of Dies Drear himself. After the Darrows are driven off, Mr. Small helps Mr. Pluto catalog the artifacts in the cavern. They agree to keep the secret, at least until the cataloging is done and the collection is ready to show to the historical society. Thomas looks forward to starting school and making friends, possibly including young Mac Darrow.

It is also known as Gair Ghalna, Gair Ghumna, Gair khelna and Gair Nachna. This dance is famous and performed mostly by all the communities but it is more famous in Mewar and Marwar regions of Rajasthan. Gair is not similar of all the places. Every place has its own rhythm, style of forming circle, costume etc. It is performed during occasions like in month of Holi and Janmastami. Colourful costumes, traditional instruments and captivating dance steps are the highlights of this dance. To enjoy this folk art form various viewers from different corners of the world flock to the state every year. Gair dance is performed by both men and women. Gair has got its birth from a Bhill dance Performance  Usually, the dancers dance in a big circle with wooden stick in their hands. There are numerous variations to this pleasing dance form that is performed by both men and women. The men wear long, pleated tunics that open out into full-length skirts Both men and women dance together, dressed in traditional costume. At the commencement of the dance, participants form two circles, the women, who form a small inner circle, are encompassed by men, who form a large circle around them, and They move first in clockwise then in anti-clockwise direction determining the rhythm of the dance by the beating together of sticks and striking of drums. As the dance proceeds, the participants change places, with men forming the inner circle. Sometimes, it is performed exclusively by men folk. At that time, a series of half-swirls make up a simpler version of the dance depending on the dancer\`s ability & proficiency, it is danced with a series of intricate pattern steps. The striking of sticks gives the dance a vigorous character & consistent tempo. Gair dances by Bhil folk are performed with wearing colourful dresses and carrying swords, arrows and sticks. It is the major attraction of people. There are many differences in the performance of men and women in this dance. The sticks used in the dance are called Khanda. It is danced with a series of intricate pattern steps. The striking of the sticks gives the dance a vigorous character and a consistent tempo. When they are dancing it seems as if they are depicting a scene from war front. It is believed by the locals that this dance must have got some significance to war. This form of dance is also seen in Africa and Central Asia. These sticks are very attractive and catch every eye. The sticks play vital role in the dance. They are very thin and does not carry much of weight and give a flare look. These sticks are cut from the Gundi tree and involves little cleaning process. In some places instead of sticks swords are used .In one hand the dancers carries the naked sword and in the other hand is occupied with Khanda(a name of sword in Rajasthan) or the stick. Apart from this Gair is also of third type in which the dancers carry sword in one hand and in the other hand they carry the wooden sword. Instruments  The musical instruments that accompany this folk dance consist of Dhol, Nagada, Dholak and flute.

History  The self-titled first album came about after Hansard and Irglov√° were approached by the Czech film director Jan H≈ôebejk while touring in the Czech Republic, and were asked by him to record songs for his upcoming film Beauty in Trouble. It was the first album that Hansard, the singer for The Frames, had released independent of his band. The tracks from the debut album \\"Falling Slowly\\" and \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\" also appeared on The Frames' album The Cost, and \\"Falling Slowly\\", \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\", \\"Lies\\" and \\"Leave\\" from the album also were on the Once soundtrack. A follow up album, Strict Joy, was released on 27 October 2009 in the United States.The Frames Newsletter Three singles from the album have been released: \\"In These Arms\\", \\"Low Rising\\", and \\"Feeling the Pull\\". Spin Magazine's review of Strict Joy gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. \\"If Glen Hansard's and Mark√©ta Irglov√°'s roles in the hit Irish indie film Once unintentionally wove the tale of their real-life falling in love, their second album as the Swell Season weaves the story of their falling out of it.\\" SPIN.com In August 2010, The Swell Season covered Neutral Milk Hotel's \\"Two-Headed Boy\\" for The A.V. Club. At a concert of 19 August 2010 at the Mountain Winery, a concert attendee leapt to his death from the roof of the venue onto the stage. The death was deemed a suicide. The band provided and paid for group counselling sessions for concert attendees who witnessed the event. In a December 2011 interview in the Huffington Post with Irglov√°, she revealed that the Swell Season would probably release a third album when Hansard finishes with other commitments, but no third album was ever made by the duo. Hansard and Irglov√° parodied their roles from Once in The Simpsons 2009 episode, \\"In the Name of the Grandfather\\". On 10 and 11 January 2015, to celebrate re-releasing Once in South Korea, The Swell Season reunited for two-night concert at Sejong Center In 2019, Hansard said there were no plans for the duo to go on tour again as their careers had taken a different turn.

It was first published in 1937 before being included as part of his collection The Long Valley the following year. Plot Summary The story opens with a panoramic view of the Salinas Valley in winter. The focus narrows and finally settles on Elisa Allen, cutting down the spent stalks of chrysanthemums, in the garden on her husband‚Äôs ranch. Elisa is thirty-five, lean and strong, and she approaches her gardening with great energy. Her husband, Henry, comes from across the yard, where he had been arranging the sale of the thirty steers. Then he offers to take Elisa to town so they can celebrate the sale. He praises her skill with flowers, and she congratulates him on doing well in the negotiations for the steer. They seem to be a well-matched couple, though their way of talking together is formal and serious. While talking about their plan to go out, Henry jokingly asks Elisa if she would like to see a fight. Showing no interest, Elisa refuses and says she wouldn't like it. They agree on dinner and a movie instead. Elisa decides to finish her transplanting before they get ready to leave for town. Elisa hears ‚Äúa squeak of wheels and a plod of hoofs,‚Äù and a man drives up in an old spring wagon (He is never named; the narrator simply calls him ‚Äúthe man‚Äù). Earning a meagre living, he fixes pots and sharpens scissors and knives. He travels from San Diego to Seattle and back every year. The man chats and jokes with Elisa, but she admits that she has no work for him to do. When he presses for a small job, she becomes annoyed and tries to send him away. Suddenly, the man‚Äôs attention turns to the flowers that Elisa is tending. When he asks about them, Elisa‚Äôs annoyance vanishes and she becomes friendly again. The man remembers seeing chrysanthemums before and describes them: ‚ÄúKind of a long-stemmed flower? Looks like a quick puff of colored smoke?‚Äù. Elisa is delighted with his description. The man tells her about one of his regular customers who also gardens. He claims this customer has asked him to bring her some chrysanthemum seeds if he ever finds some in his travels, and Elisa is happy to oblige. She invites the man into the yard and prepares a pot of chrysanthemum shoots for the putative woman‚Äôs garden. She gives him full instructions for tending them. Elisa envies the man‚Äôs life on the road and is attracted to him because he understands her love of flowers. In a moment of extreme emotion, she nearly reaches for him but snatches her hand back before she touches him. Instead, she finds him two pots to mend, and he drives away with fifty cents and the chrysanthemum shoots, promising to take care of them until he can deliver the chrysanthemums to the other woman. Elisa goes into the house to get dressed for dinner. She scrubs herself vigorously and examines her naked body in the mirror before putting on her dress and makeup. When Henry sees her, he compliments her, telling her she looks \\"nice,\\" ‚Äúdifferent, strong and happy‚Äù. When Henry and Elisa drive into town, she sees \\"a dark speck\\" ahead on the road. It turns out the man tossed her chrysanthemum shoots out of his wagon, but kept the pot Elisa had put them in. She feels hurt. Henry does not notice and Elisa does not mention it to him. It's then that Elisa brings up an interest in the fights that night. She asks if \\"women ever go to the fights\\". Henry answers \\"Oh sure, some\\", but reminds her that she probably wouldn't like it. She agrees and says the night out alone will be plenty. She turns her head so he cannot see her crying. She also says she feels like an old woman. Characters Elisa Allen - A thirty-five-year-old woman who lives on a ranch just across the Salinas River with her husband, Henry. Elisa is described as having a \\"lean and strong\\" face and eyes as \\"clear as water\\" and when wearing her gardening costume, she looks like she has a blocked and heavy figure. Elisa usually spends her time in the garden, tending to her chrysanthemums. Henry Allen - Elisa's husbands and who lives on the ranch with her. He loves Elisa's passion for the garden, but cannot seem to understand why she never uses her gift for anything else besides the chrysanthemums. The Man - A travelling mender who arrives on the road in a wagon that has a canvas painted with the words \\"Pots, pans, knives, sisors, lawn mores, Fixed.\\" on it. The man is not given a formal name throughout the story.  Symbolism  The Language of Flowers often translate to symbolism commonly within literature. In \\"The Chrysanthemums,\\" the chrysanthemum flowers are frequently used as a symbol throughout the story. The chrysanthemums are mentioned throughout the story and can be seen a symbol of Elisa. Chrysanthemum stems are long, strong, and tough which are symbolic of Elisa's masculine qualities. However, the flower itself is delicate and tender which represents the parts of Elisa that are feminine. The contradictory characteristics of chrysanthemums being both strong yet beautiful epitomize how Elisa is atypical of a woman for being both masculine and feminine. This is proven true when Elisa sees the flowers in the middle of the road and that the pot is gone; she is hurt by the discovery almost as if she is the flower herself. Elisa viewed it as letting herself be free and just getting hurt as an end result. Many critics also argue that the chrysanthemums are a symbol of women's frustration.Sweet, Charles A. \\"Ms. Elisa Allen and Steinbeck's\\" The Chrysanthemums\\".\\" Modern Fiction Studies 20.2 (1974): 210. Another thing that the chrysanthemums symbolize is \\"Elisa's children\\". It is seen periodically throughout the story by how Elisa cares for and protects her chrysanthemums. Overall, the chrysanthemums symbolize Elisa's role as a woman in society. In the beginning, they symbolize her children, but as we continue reading, they start to symbolize her femininity and sexuality. Elisa gets annoyed with her life because of the fact that a child and romantic encounters are nonexistent in her marriage. Her husband, Henry, also does not cater to her emotional needs and the qualities of her womanhood. She eventually thinks that things will change, but once she sees the chrysanthemums in the road, she realizes that her hopes have died as well. Symbolism in \\"The Chrysanthemums\\" There is also the symbolism about confinement. The story opens by describing the setting of the fog over the Salinas Valley \\"like a lid on the mountains and [make] of the valley a closed pot.\\"Steinbeck, John. The chrysanthemums. Perfection Form Company, 1979. This foreshadows Elisa's situation of being unable to truly please her husband with her gift of raising Chrysanthemums in addition to being unaware of people who may try to deceive her for personal gain.

This heuristic was designed initially to address combinatorial optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem and spin glasses, although the technique has been demonstrated to function in optimization domains.  Relation to self-organized criticality  Self- organized criticality (SOC) is a statistical physics concept to describe a class of dynamical systems that have a critical point as an attractor. Specifically, these are non-equilibrium systems that evolve through avalanches of change and dissipations that reach up to the highest scales of the system. SOC is said to govern the dynamics behind some natural systems that have these burst-like phenomena including landscape formation, earthquakes, evolution, and the granular dynamics of rice and sand piles. Of special interest here is the Bak‚ÄìSneppen model of SOC, which is able to describe evolution via punctuated equilibrium (extinction events) ‚Äì thus modelling evolution as a self-organised critical process.  Relation to computational complexity  Another piece in the puzzle is work on computational complexity, specifically that critical points have been shown to exist in NP-complete problems, where near-optimum solutions are widely dispersed and separated by barriers in the search space causing local search algorithms to get stuck or severely hampered. It was the evolutionary self-organised criticality model by Bak and Sneppen and the observation of critical points in combinatorial optimisation problems that lead to the development of Extremal Optimization by Stefan Boettcher and Allon Percus.  The technique  EO was designed as a local search algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. Unlike genetic algorithms, which work with a population of candidate solutions, EO evolves a single solution and makes local modifications to the worst components. This requires that a suitable representation be selected which permits individual solution components to be assigned a quality measure (\\"fitness\\"). This differs from holistic approaches such as ant colony optimization and evolutionary computation that assign equal-fitness to all components of a solution based upon their collective evaluation against an objective function. The algorithm is initialized with an initial solution, which can be constructed randomly, or derived from another search process. The technique is a fine-grained search, and superficially resembles a hill climbing (local search) technique. A more detailed examination reveals some interesting principles, which may have applicability and even some similarity to broader population-based approaches (evolutionary computation and artificial immune system). The governing principle behind this algorithm is that of improvement through selectively removing low-quality components and replacing them with a randomly selected component. This is obviously at odds with genetic algorithms, the quintessential evolutionary computation algorithm that selects good solutions in an attempt to make better solutions. The resulting dynamics of this simple principle is firstly a robust hill climbing search behaviour, and secondly a diversity mechanism that resembles that of multiple-restart search. Graphing holistic solution quality over time (algorithm iterations) shows periods of improvement followed by quality crashes (avalanche) very much in the manner as described by punctuated equilibrium. It is these crashes or dramatic jumps in the search space that permit the algorithm to escape local optima and differentiate this approach from other local search procedures. Although such punctuated-equilibrium behaviour can be \\"designed\\" or \\"hard-coded\\", it should be stressed that this is an emergent effect of the negative-component- selection principle fundamental to the algorithm. EO has primarily been applied to combinatorial problems such as graph partitioning and the travelling salesman problem, as well as problems from statistical physics such as spin glasses.  Variations on the theme and applications  Generalised extremal optimization (GEO) was developed to operate on bit strings where component quality is determined by the absolute rate of change of the bit, or the bits contribution to holistic solution quality. This work includes application to standard function optimisation problems as well as engineering problem domains. Another similar extension to EO is Continuous Extremal Optimization (CEO). EO has been applied to image rasterization as well as used as a local search after using ant colony optimization. EO has been used to identify structures in complex networks. EO has been used on a multiple target tracking problem. Finally, some work has been done on investigating the probability distribution used to control selection.

He was executed during the Great Purge in June 1937 and was posthumously rehabilitated in 1957. Biography Uborevich was born into a peasant family in the village of Antandraja in the Novoalexandrovsky Uyezd of the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Lithuania). After graduating from the Dvinsk (now Daugavpils) realschule, he attended the Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute before transferring in 1915 to the , from which he graduated in 1916, receiving command of a battery and later a company. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1917 and, after the October Revolution, began recruiting Red Guards in Bessarabia. During Operation Faustschlag in March 1918 he was injured and taken captive by the Central Powers. He escaped in August, joined the Red Army, and served as an artillery instructor and commander of the Dvinsk Brigade on the Northern Front. In December 1918 he received command of the 18th Rifle Division of the 6th Army. During the Russian Civil War, he held several significant commands, including: commander of the 14th Army of the Southern Front and the Southwestern Front (6 October 1919 ‚Äì 24 February 1920, 17 April ‚Äì 7 July 1920, and 15 November ‚Äì 15 December 1920); commander of the 9th Kuban Army of the Southern Front (1 March ‚Äì 5 April 1920); commander of the 13th Army of the Southern Front (10 July ‚Äì 11 November 1920); and commander of the 5th Army of the Eastern Front (27 August 1921 ‚Äì 14 August 1922). Besides combat against the Whites and the Poles, he was also involved in the defeat of Nestor Makhno and Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz and acted as assistant to Mikhail Tukhachevsky during the Tambov Rebellion in 1921‚Äì1922. From August to November 1922 he served as minister of war of the Far Eastern Republic and commander-in-chief of its People's Revolutionary Army. In the latter position, he oversaw the storming of Spassk-Dalny and the seizure of Vladivostok in October, and finally, the ouster from Primorsky Krai of the last major White forces in Russian territory, the Zemskaya Rat of Mikhail Diterikhs. From August to November he served in the Far Eastern Bureau of the Comintern. Uborevich was a member of All-Russian Central Executive Committee from 1922 and was then, consecutively, commander of a series of military districts: Ural (June 1924 ‚Äì January 1925); North Caucasus (January 1925 ‚Äì 1927); Moscow (1928 ‚Äì 18 November 1929); Belorussia (April 1931 ‚Äì 20 May 1937); and Central Asia (20‚Äì29 May 1937). He also attended the military academy of the German General Staff twice (1927‚Äì1928 and June 1933). He had a close relationship with his counterparts in the Reichswehr, acquiring important information on German weapon developments. He was also a member of the Soviet Revolutionary Military Council (June 1930 ‚Äì June 1931) and chief of armaments for the Red Army (November 1929 ‚Äì April 1931). He acted a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) from 1931 to 1937 and from 1934 was a member of the military council of the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union. Uborevich was arrested on May 29, 1937, and along with Tukhachevsky, August Kork, and others, was arraigned in the Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization on June 11, 1937. Judged guilty of espionage and sabotage by a clandestine military tribunal, he was sentenced to death and executed on the same day. During the Khrushchev Thaw he was posthumously rehabilitated by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union on January 31, 1957.

It was released on their 1965 album Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) and as the B-side to \\"California Girls\\". Sibling bandmates Carl and Dennis Wilson later praised the song, calling it the point where they began to take notice of Brian's abilities. It was one of the first songs that Brian wrote while under the influence of marijuana. According to Brian, the song is \\"about a girl who was dating a guy who didn‚Äôt stay close to her. The guy singing wants the girl to let her boyfriend run around and eventually leave her so he can come in and get her. He wants a bad thing to happen so that it‚Äôll turn into a good thing.\\" Production A soulful ballad, the song is said to have been inspired by Burt Bacharach while also foreshadowing the relatively complex music dynamics of Pet Sounds several months later. Author Jim Fusilli explained, \\"[it] is a gorgeous track, albeit a bit busy at the chorus when compared to what's ahead, with major seventh chords that ring beautifully. The song's subtle horn charts, prominent tremolo bass, the vibraphone, and the sweet, pensive section after the chorus portend the sounds of a forthcoming classic.\\" MOJO wrote: \\"With key and tempo changes bolder and weirder than anything before, this was Brian's signpost to the psychedelic country up ahead.\\" With production by Brian Wilson and engineering by Chuck Britz, the instrumental was recorded on March 20, 1965 at United Western Recorders, Hollywood. A few weeks later, vocals were overdubbed at CBS Columbia Square with a final mix occurring on May 28. Brian later reflected that his vocal on the track was too shrill, saying, \\"I sounded like a little girl,\\" and \\"I sounded like a fairy,\\" naming it his least favorite Beach Boys recording.

It was developed in the 1990s, based on earlier technologies.  History  The SILEX process was developed in Australia by Dr. Michael Goldsworthy and Dr. Horst Struve, working at Silex Systems Limited, a company founded in 1988. Their process was based on earlier methods of laser enrichment developed starting in the early 1970s, such as AVLIS (atomic vapor laser isotope separation) and MLIS (molecular laser isotope separation). In 1993, the foundation of a set of principles for the separation of isotopes by laser excitation to enrich uranium were established by Goldsworthy and Struve at SILEX headquarters in Sydney. In November 1996, Silex Systems Limited licensed its technology exclusively to United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) for uranium enrichment. In 1999, the United States signed the Agreement for Cooperation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America concerning Technology for the Separation of Isotopes of Uranium by Laser Excitation [SILEX Agreement], which allowed cooperative research and development between the two countries on the SILEX process.‚ÄúAgreement for Cooperation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America concerning Technology for the Separation of Isotopes of Uranium by Laser Excitation (SILEX Agreement), Agreed Minute and Exchange of Notes (Washington, 28 October 1999). ATS 19 of 2000‚Äù. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017. Silex Systems concluded the second stage of testing in 2005 and began its Test Loop Program. In 2007, Silex Systems signed an exclusive commercialization and licensing agreement with General Electric Corporation. The Test Loop Program was transferred to GE's facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. Also in 2007, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) signed letters of intent for uranium enrichment services with Exelon and Entergy - the two largest nuclear power utilities in the USA. In 2008, GEH spun off Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) to commercialise the SILEX Technology and announced the first potential commercial uranium enrichment facility using the Silex process. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved a license amendment allowing GLE to operate the Test Loop. Also in 2008, Cameco Corporation, the world's largest uranium producer, joined GE and Hitachi as a part owner of GLE. In 2010, concerns were raised that the SILEX process poses a threat to global nuclear security. Compared to current enrichment technologies, the SILEX process requires as little as 25% of the space and consumes considerably less energy. It is reportedly almost undetectable from orbit, potentially allowing rogue governments' activities to go undetected by the international community. In August 2011, GLE applied to the NRC for a permit to build a commercial plant at Wilmington, which would enrich uranium to a maximum of 8% 235U. On September 19, 2012, the NRC made its initial decision on GLE's application, and granted the requested permit.Nuclear Regulatory Commission announcement date=2012-09-19 http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1226/ML12263A046.pdf Silex completed its phase I test loop program at GE-Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment's (GLE) facility in North Carolina. The commercial plant's target enrichment level is 8 percent, which puts it on the upper end of low-enriched uranium. In 2014, both GLE and Silex Systems restructured, with Silex halving its workforce. In 2016 GEH withdrew from GLE, writing-off their investment. In 2016, the United States Department of Energy agreed to sell about 300,000 tonnes of depleted uranium hexafluoride to GLE for re-enrichment using the SILEX process over 40 years at a proposed Paducah, Kentucky Laser Enrichment Facility. In 2018, Silex Systems abandoned its plans for GLE, intending to repatriate the SILEX technology to Australia. Process According to Laser Focus World, the SILEX process exposes a cold stream of a mixture of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) molecules and a carrier gas to energy from a pulsed laser. The laser used is a CO2 laser operating at a wavelength of 10.8 Œºm (micrometres) and optically amplified to 16 Œºm, which is in the infrared spectrum. The amplification is achieved in a Raman conversion cell, a large vessel filled with high-pressure para-hydrogen. The 16 Œºm wavelength laser preferentially excites the 235UF6, creating a difference in the isotope ratios in a product stream, which is enriched in 235U, and a tailings stream, which has an increased fraction of the more common 238U. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that \\"The lasers electrically charge the atoms, which become trapped in an electromagnetic field and drawn to a metal plate for collection.\\" According to John L. Lyman, the Silex Systems Ltd. (SSL) research facility in Australia uses a laser pulsed at a frequency of 50 Hz, a rate that results in great inefficiency. At 50 Hz, only 1% of the UF6 feedstock is processed. This results in a high fraction of feedstock entering the product stream and a low observed enrichment rates. Consequently, a working enrichment plant would have to substantially increase the laser duty cycle. In addition, the preparation time needed is prohibitively long for full-scale production. The SSL research facility requires ten hours of prep time for a one-hour enrichment test run, significantly restricting output. Further details of the technology, such as how it differs from the older molecular laser isotope separation (MLIS) and atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) processes, are not known publicly. The technique can be used for the isotopic enrichment of chlorine, molybdenum and uranium, and similar technologies can be used with carbon and silicon.  Nuclear security concerns  A physicist at Princeton University, Ryan Snyder, noted that the SILEX process could create an easy path towards a nuclear weapon due to the ability to reach a high level of uranium enrichment, that is difficult to detect. Security classification SILEX is the only privately held information that is classified by the U.S. government. In June 2001, the U.S. Department of Energy classified \\"certain privately generated information concerning an innovative isotope separation process for enriching uranium.\\" Under the Atomic Energy Act, all information not specifically declassified is classified as Restricted Data, whether it is privately or publicly held. This is in marked distinction to the national security classification executive order, which states that classification can only be assigned to information \\"owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government.\\" This is the only known case of the Atomic Energy Act being used in such a manner. Popular culture The 2014 Australian Broadcasting Corporation drama The Code uses \\"Laser Uranium Enrichment\\" as a core plot device. The female protagonist Sophie Walsh states that the technology will be smaller, less energy-intensive, and more difficult to control once it is a viable alternative to current methods of enrichment. Ms. Walsh also states that the development of the technology has been protracted, and that there are significant governmental interests in maintaining the secrecy and classified status of the technology.

At the time Ja√©n was a dependency of Granada, and the appellation conflict may only be apparent. Abu Hayyan was said to be generally handsome, tall and long haired, which, along with his beard, turned grey in old age. =Education= At a young age, Abu Hayyan left Spain and traveled extensively for the sake of his studies. Within Spain, he traveled to M√°laga, Almer√≠a before moving on through Ceuta, Tunis, Alexandria, Cairo, Damietta, Minya, Kush and ‚ÄòAydhab in Africa. Eventually, he reached Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage and visited Medina before returning to Alexandria. It is said he memorized the corpus of Sibawayh's al-Kitab ('The Book') - several volumes of the foundational Arabic grammar that, for some, held revered authority on the Arabic language approaching that of the Hadith in Islamic law.Encyclopaedia of Islam, vol. I, A-B, pg. 126. Eds. Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb, J.H. Kramers, √âvariste L√©vi-Proven√ßal and Joseph Schacht. Assisted by Bernard Lewis and Charles Pellat. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1979. Print edition. Abu Hayyan was a student of Ibn al-Nafis, viewed as a redeeming quality in favor of Ibn al-Nafis by traditionalists such as Al-Dhahabi, who esteemed Abu Hayyan.Fancy, Nahyan A. G. (2006), \\"Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafƒ´s (died 1288)\\", Electronic Theses and Dissertations, University of Notre Dame, pg. 147-148 =Career= On reaching Mamluk Egypt, Abu Hayyan was appointed lecturer of the science of Qur'anic exegesis at the college named after the sultan of Egypt, Al-Mansur Qalawun, in Alexandria.Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, trs. Pascual de Gayangos y Arce, pg. 423. Later, he spent a period teaching tafsir in the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo. Abu Hayyan won favor at the court of an-Nasir Muhammad; the scholar Fat·∏• al-Din Ibn Sayyid al-NƒÅs and he, often judged the poetry contests held during al-Nasir's reign.Devin J.

Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2009. When Abu Hayyan's daughter, Nudhar, died, he received permission to inter her body at his family's property instead of at a cemetery. Such permissions were not typical, and it seems the request was granted due to his high standing with the royal court. Abu Hayyan was deeply affected by daughter's death and he composed an elegy in praise of her standing among intellectual circles.Extraordinary Women of Al-Andalus. Cities of Light: The Rise and Fall of Islamic Spain. Unity Productions Foundation: 2007. =Death= Abu Hayyan died on a Saturday in July in the year 1344 at his home in Cairo, just after the last evening prayer.Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, trns. by Pascual de Gayangos y Arce. Pg. 425. He was buried the next day in the cemetery of Bab al-Nasr in Islamic Cairo. When news of his death reached Damascus, the population mourned his death. Views Abu Hayyan adhered to the Zahiri madhhab of Sunni Islam.al- Maqrizi, al-Muqni al-Kabir, vol. 7, pg. 505. When asked toward the end of his life about a claim he had switched to the Shafi'i madhhab, or some other school, he responded that, anyone who had known the ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´ school could never leave it.Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, al-Durar al-Kamina, vol. 4, pg. 304.Michael Carer, \\"The Andalusian Grammarians: Are they different?\\" Taken from In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arab Culture, Pg. 34. Ed. Bilal Orfali. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. Print. He regarded Sufism as heresy, and the metaphysicsts ibn Arabi, Mansur Al-Hallaj, Ibn al-Farid, Ibn Sab'in and Abu al-Hasan al-Shushtari, as especially impious heretics. On the Arabic language, Abu Hayyan shared the views of his fellow ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´ Andalusian, Ibn Ma·∏çƒÅ æ. Absolute belief in the divine mover led them to reject the concept of linguistic causality. For them the 'cause' of all things, including language, is attributable solely to God.Michael Carter, \\"The Andalusian Grammarians,\\" pg. 39. Thus on theological grounds, he was suspicious of the so-called \\"eastern grammarian\\" supporters of 'linguistic causality'. When Abu Hayyan arrived in Egypt the Mamluk Sultan was ruler. Although Abu Hayyan held the Turkic languages of Mamluk Egypt superior to the Kipchak and Turkmen languages with which he was familiar,Versteegh, Arabic, pg. 169. he also wrote grammars of Amharic, Middle Mongol, the Berber languages and the Turkic. Other Arabic-language linguists of his day had little regard for foreign languages.Versteegh, Arabic, pg. 106. Abu Hayyan often illuminated Arabic grammatical concepts with quotes from various language. Legacy Abu Hayyan, the so-called 'king of grammar', was celebrated as the unrivalled linguistic scholar and religious expert of hadith, historiography and Sharia. He is referred to alternately as Abu Hayyan \\"al-Gharnati\\" ('the Granadian') and Abu Hayyan \\"al-Nahwi\\" ('the grammarian'). Abu Hayyan's studies of grammar were governed by overarching principles he laid out such as \\"one must base rules of Arabic on frequency of occurrence\\" and \\"analogous formations that contradict genuine data found in good speech are not permitted.\\" His approach to grammar has been described by Brill's Encyclopaedia of Islam as remarkably modern, and Abu Hayyan's respect for facts and unusual objectivity have also been noted. =Works= Only 15 of the 65 works attributed to Abu Hayyan Athir al-Din Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Gharnati survive. *Tafsƒ´r al-Ba·∏•r al-Mu·∏•ƒ´t (); 'The Explanation Ocean' (Bayr≈´t, DƒÅr al-Fikr, 1992); archive.org (12 vols., in Arabic); commentary on the linguistic meanings of Quran, composed in collaboration with al-Mansur, late in Gharnati's life.Abdulmageed Falah, Grammatical Opinions of Abu Hayyan Andalusi between Theory and Practice.

Cutino (April 3, 1933 ‚Äì September 19, 2004) was an American swimming and water polo coach and educator for over 40 years and the author of several books and numerous articles on coaching aquatic sports. In his 26 years as head coach at the University of California, Berkeley, his Cal teams won eight NCAA titles. He was the all-time winning coach in U.S. water polo history. His efforts for water sports training, development of facilities for competition and philanthropic support of athletes earned him national recognition. In 1999, the Peter J. Cutino Award was established in his honor by the San Francisco Olympic Club, and is presented annually to the top American male and female collegiate water polo players. Coaching Cutino attended college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and received a master's degree in education in 1959. At Cal Poly, he made the varsity water polo and swimming teams, was selected three-time water polo all-conference and held multiple school records. From 1958 to 1963, Cutino was head water polo and swimming coach at Oxnard High School, where his swim teams compiled a 64‚Äì8 record and five county championships and several Southern California championships, while his water polo team went 80‚Äì12. In 1961, his team played El Segundo High School coached by 1964 Olympic coach Uri Saari. The El Segundo team had several Olympians-to- be on its team. But Pete had home pool and the refs. Home pool had a shallow end, and both the goalie and O hole defender of Oxnard skillfully used the bottom. In a classic momentum shifting tug of war, Oxnard won. In 1963 Cutino became head coach of both the UC Berkeley men's water polo and swimming programs. In 1974 Hall of Fame coach Nort Thornton took over the swim program, leading Cal swimmers to two national championships. Cutino directed Golden Bear water polo teams to eight national championships and a 519-172-10 career record during his 25-year tenure. His last team in 1988 won a school-record 33 games on the way to a second straight NCAA title. Cutino coached 68 All- Americans, six Pac-10 and NCAA Players of the Year, and five Olympians. The Cutino presence at Cal water polo matches was both showmanship and strategy. Known for his passion, he would pace the edge of the pool, shouting and a congratulating, and constantly working the officials. His athletes learned quickly about his training system. \\"He taught us that anything worth accomplishing would not come without discomfort,\\" recalls Kirk Everist, who played for Cutino at Cal and is now the head coach there. \\"And he was always there to administer the discomfort.\\" Cutino served as head coach of the US National Team (1972‚Äì76), the US Olympic Team (1976), and the US team at the World University Games in Yugoslavia (1987). He was elected to the FINA Technical Water Polo Committee, the international governing body of the sport, as well as leadership roles in the NCAA and USA Water Polo. After retiring as Cal head coach in 1989, Cutino continued to conduct clinics and coached Olympic Club teams. He participated at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, as a water polo official and served as chairman of the Men‚Äôs International Olympic Committee.

Young Pete wanted to become a fisherman like his father, and worked on board the boat frequently as a boy. He later said many of the coaching techniques he used were learned working with his father's crew. \\"They had ways of just motivating you on the boat. Everything was competition,\\" he said. \\"It was a macho thing...but it was exciting as hell.\\" He recalled that when he was in his 40s, he came home to find his father needed another hand on the boat. \\"I said, I went to the greatest university in the world, they call me professor, I'm going to take my vacation.\\" There was silence. Then his father said, You gonna go fishing or you gonna be a bum?\\" Monterey was home. He starred on the swim team at Monterey High School, where his wife, Louise, was a cheerleader. Leon Panetta, the former congressman and White House chief of staff, grew up, like Cutino, in the section of Monterey between Calle Principal and the Presidio, the neighborhood Cutino wrote about in his memoir Monterey: A View from Garlic Hill, a book on the local Italian-American community. In 1989 when he stepped down as UC Berkeley's head water polo coach, he returned to run the Monterey Sports Club, promoting athletics in the local community. When Pete Cutino died in 2004 at age 71, some 1200 of his former players ‚Äîalong with friends, family, local and national sports and community leaders ‚Äî attended his memorial service. His son, Peter J. Cutino Jr. was a two-time All-American at UC Berkeley, and helped lead the Bears to the NCAA National Championship. He was also named Pac-10 Conference Player of the Year, 1983 NCAA Collegiate Co-Player of the Year, and Co-MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Peter Cutino Jr. is the president of the Seville Water Polo Foundation. His brother, Bert Cutino, is a successful local restaurateur, distinguished executive chef of the American Academy of Chefs and co-sponsors a national hospitality scholarship program.

Duan is best known outside of China for being the author of an early version of Cinderella, called Ye Xian. In 853, the story first appeared in Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, which was published shortly after he returned to Chang'an after his term of acting Governor of Jizhou (now known as Ji'an in Jiangsu). It is believed that it was a folktale told by peasants before it was recorded on paper. Some people even believe that the French author Charles Perrault copied Duan's version, only he renamed it and slightly altered it. Duan is also known for describing in his written work of 863 AD the slave trade, ivory trade, and ambergris trade of Bobali, which believed to be what is now Berbera in Somaliland, East Africa.Levathes, 38.

Plot There is unrest in the upper class Marshwood house as Nigel (Edward Atterton), the Earl of Marshwood, is engaged to a film actress, Miranda Frayle. However, many disapprove because this would mean Nigel would be marrying below his class. When Nigel brings Miranda home to the Marshwood estate to meet his family, Lady Marshwood's (Julie Andrews) maid Moxie (Sophie Thompson) reveals that Miranda is her sister; they devise a charade so that Moxie may meet her sister as an equal. However, when Miranda lies about her past (stating she's a cockney and that Moxie was a drunk and is now dead), Moxie finds it harder and harder to hide her identity.

It encompasses a total of . Along with West Virginia National Cemetery, it is one of two United States Department of Veterans Affairs national cemeteries in West Virginia, both of which are located in Grafton. The first interments took place in 1867 for casualties of the American Civil War in West Virginia. The Grafton cemetery is closed to most new interments due to inadequate space. Interments are made at nearby West Virginia National Cemetery since it was dedicated in 1987.  History  In 1867, the United States Department of War directed Major R. C. Bates to find a location where the remains of Union soldiers who had died in West Virginia during the American Civil War could be properly re-interred. (Initially part of the Commonwealth of Virginia at the start of the American Civil War and, as a result, a part of the Confederate States of America due to Virginia's secession from the United States prior to the start of that war, West Virginia subsequently became part of the Union after it seceded from Virginia and the CSA, and formed a new state in 1863.) Bates found a site adjacent to the town of Grafton's Maple Avenue Cemetery, where many soldiers had already been buried. The terrain was also relatively level, unusual for the mountainous region. The 39th Congress appropriated a site that same year. The cemetery was dedicated in 1868 by Arthur I. Boreman, the first Governor of West Virginia. Boreman was key in the two-year campaign for a cemetery in the state. The first interments were held in the lower two terraces: 1,252 Union soldiers, 613 of which were unknown, were buried. Remains from temporary graves in Clarksburg, Grant County, Fayette County, Kanawha County, Marion County, Rich Mountain battle site, and Wheeling, as well as several Union dead from Kentucky were relocated to the National Cemetery. Additionally, some Confederate soldiers were buried. The cemetery contains the burial site of Thornsbury Bailey Brown,Historical Marker Project believed to have been the first Union casualty of the Civil War. Brown was believed to have been killed on May 22, 1861 when he refused to acknowledge a Confederate sentry. Brown is said to have shot the Confederate in the ear, and was then shot in the heart. Brown was reinterred at Grafton in 1903 in Section F, Grave 1226. In 1904, the Grand Army of the Republic dedicated a memorial marble obelisk. The three-acre site sits along Grafton's Walnut Street. It is surrounded by a stone wall approximately high, with entrance gates on three of the sides. A walkway and series of stairs divides the site in half, running from the Walnut Street entrance to the rear entrance. Smaller walkways are laid out perpendicular to the central path, dividing the cemetery into six sections on three leveled terraces. A large flag pole sites in the middle of the central terrace, while next to it is a plaque containing wording from an 1875 act of Congress regarding the preservation of the cemetery. On the lower terrace are two more plaques that contain the wording of Theodore O'Hara' poem, Bivouac of the Dead. Along the edges of the cemetery are five additional memorial sites dedicated to cenotaphs for service men whose bodies were not recovered, either from sea or elsewhere. The grave markers on the two upper levels are uniform small, white, rectangular stones with arched tops, while the bottom level contains private, individual markers. Two buildings have stood on the cemetery grounds. A Superintendent's Lodge designed by General Montgomery C. Meigs stood until it was demolished in 1957. The modern caretaker's house, a -story stone building, was constructed c. 1900 and later served as an administrative building. By the 1960s the Grafton cemetery had limited free space for burials. West Virginia veterans groups began lobbying for a new national cemetery after a 1975 study determined the limited remaining space at Grafton was too steep or costly to use. The West Virginia United Veterans National Cemetery Committee was established and sought to pressure the governor and federal government representatives to seek a new national cemetery. In 1987, the West Virginia National Cemetery opened nearby. The Grafton cemetery closed to most new interments. The cemetery offers interment for veterans or eligible family members in existing gravesites. Grafton National Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 2, 1982. In addition to the two cemeteries, Grafton holds the longest ongoing annual Memorial Day celebration in the country, first decorating the graves of soldiers in 1867.

Construction was delayed by work negotiations and poor weather conditions. A dedication ceremony took place on September 28, 1987 and the cemetery was opened for interments the next day, even though construction was incomplete. The cemetery contains the Industrial School for Boys monument, a granite memorial erected in 1992 in memory of the residents of the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys who were buried at the cemetery between 1890 and 1939.

Harris and two other American soldiers‚ÄîCorporal Judge C. Hellums and Private Donald D. Owens‚Äîwere killed on October 9, 1944 when their M10 tank destroyer was destroyed by an explosion in France. The soldiers' remains were identified at the time of the incident, but after the war Army Graves Registration Service members were unable to locate the remains. In 1947, the three men were declared dead and their remains unrecoverable by a military board. The board was unaware that an Army group had removed the remains and had them buried unidentified at Ardennes American Cemetery in Belgium. After an ID bracelet was recovered from the site in 2003, investigations between 2006 and 2008 led to the graves being exhumed for DNA testing.

It collects the first six issues of Jeff Smith's self-published Bone comics. It marks the beginning of part one (of three) of the Bone series, titled Vernal Equinox. The book was first published by Cartoon Books in its original black-and-white version in 1995; excerpts were printed in Disney Adventures over the course of 1994‚Äì1998. Paperback and hardback colored editions were published in 2005 by Scholastic. The first volume follows the three Bone cousins as they meet the inhabitants of a mysterious valley and seek their help in finding the way back to their home in Boneville. Synopsis =The Map= The three Bone cousins, Fone, Phoney and Smiley, are lost in the desert after being run out of their hometown of Boneville. Eventually they find a hand-drawn map and are attacked by a swarm of locusts. Fone Bone escapes, but falls off a cliff; climbs the other side; and finds a trail of Smiley's cigars that lead into a nearby mountain range. When he sleeps that night, two rat creatures attempt to eat him, and he is rescued by the Great Red Dragon. Soon after, he crosses over the mountains and into a valley ad meets Ted (a treehopper-like insect), who suggests that Fone seek counsel from Thorn, before winter arrives; but Fone is soon isolated by the snow. =Thorn= Fone Bone has nearly built a winter house when his neighbor Miz Possum leaves her three sons in his care. During a game, they are caught by the two rat creatures; but Fone saves the children and sends them to their mother, while he distracts the rat creatures; these are ultimately driven away by the Great Red Dragon. Once re-assured of the opossums' safety, Fone discovers a hot spring, and becomes enamored of a young woman he encounters there. She identifies herself as Ted's friend Thorn, and takes Fone to her own house to consult her grandmother. =Phoney Bone= Fone Bone is staying at Thorn's house, and helping with chores prior to the arrival of Thorn's grandmother, Gran'ma Ben, who is coming from the annual Great Cow Race, while Thorn makes a pie. Fone Bone shows Thorn the map found in the desert, which Thorn finds familiar. Meanwhile, Phoney Bone meets Gran'ma Ben, and instantly offends her; but he and Fone Bone are reunited at the house. =Kingdok= The day before the Spring Fair at the nearby town, Fone and Phoney are helping out at Thorn and Ben's farmstead. To make extra money, Phoney sneaks into town early, and overhears the Rat Creatures are on the lookout for a \\"small bald creature with a star on its chest\\": a clear description of Phoney Bone himself. The Rat Creatures are called to council with the mysterious Hooded One: a facsimile of the Grim Reaper, who sends every Rat Creature in the valley to attack the farm. =Barrelhaven= With the farm house under attack, Gran'ma Ben fights off the Rat Creatures. When Thorn and Fone are surrounded, the Great Red Dragon chases the Rat Creature army away. They return to the farm house to find it wrecked and smoldering. Phoney Bone arrives at the Barrelhaven Tavern and discovers Smiley Bone as a barman; but is immediately recruited himself as dishwasher by proprietor Lucius Down, when his money is revealed to be worthless there. =Phoney's Inferno= Thorn, Fone, and the Dragon arrive back at the farm to find Gran'ma Ben alive, and the Dragon, in implication of a long acquaintance, addresses her by her first name of Rose; but she remains distrustful of him. Phoney Bone, at work under Lucius' orders, is frightened by the Hooded One. When Thorn, Ben, and Fone Bone arrive in town for the Spring Fair, the three Bone cousins are reunited at last.

The Old Protestant Cemetery (; ) is a cemetery in Santo Ant√≥nio, Macau, China. It was established by the British East India Company in 1821 in Portuguese Macau in response to a lack of burial sites for Protestants in the Roman Catholic Portuguese colony. It is the last resting place of the artist George Chinnery, missionaries Robert Morrison and Samuel Dyer (his wife Maria is buried at the Old Protestant Cemetery in Penang), Royal Navy captain Henry John Spencer-Churchill (son of the 5th Duke of Marlborough and great-great-grand-uncle of Winston Churchill) and US Naval Lieutenant Joseph Harod Adams (grandson of the second president of the United States, John Adams, and nephew of the sixth, John Quincy Adams). Humphrey Fleming Senhouse, a captain in the Royal Navy, is also buried here, as is John Robert Morrison, son of Robert Morrison, who was appointed as Acting Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong but died eight days later in Macau from fever. William Napier, 9th Lord Napier was buried in the cemetery but his body was subsequently exhumed and reburied in Scotland. Another grave is that of Anders Ljungstedt, a prosperous Swedish businessman, interpreter and historian. In 2005, the cemetery was officially enlisted as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Center of Macau.  History  Macau was considered by the Portuguese to be sacred Roman Catholic ground and the authorities barred the burial of Protestants within its city walls, whilst on the other side of the barrier gate the Chinese were equally as intolerant of the burial of foreigners in its soil. This left the Protestant community of British, American and Northern European traders with the only option of a secret night- time burial in the land between the city walls and the barrier gate, and the risk of confrontation with Chinese should they be discovered, or worse, desecration of the grave once they had gone. The matter was finally resolved in 1821 after the death of Robert Morrison's wife, Mary, when the local committee of the East India Company voted to purchase a plot of land and resolve its legal status with the Portuguese such that the burial of Protestants would be permitted there. Later, the East India Company allowed burial of all foreigners, and several graves were moved from other locations outside the city walls into the cemetery, explaining why some graves are dated before its founding in 1821. Nationals of Britain, the United States of America, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Germany are buried there. The cemetery was closed in 1858, after which the cemetery began to be referred to as the \\"Old\\" Protestant Cemetery. Morrison Chapel Adjoining the cemetery is the Morrison Chapel, named in honour of Robert Morrison.

A shortstop by trade, he spent eight years in the Dodger farm system, buried (along with many others) behind Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese. In , the Dodgers' first season in Lillis's home city of Los Angeles, he made the Major League team. Lillis never claimed the regular shortstop job ‚Äî that would go to Maury Wills ‚Äî and in the middle of the campaign, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals. After a half season with the Redbirds, he was selected by Houston in the 1961 MLB expansion draft. Lillis then spent almost six full seasons as a shortstop and utility infielder for the Astros, serving as a coach for the first two weeks of before being activated as an infielder. Houston then released him at season's end. Over his ten-year MLB career, Lillis appeared in 817 games and batted .236 with three home runs; his 549 hits included 68 doubles and nine triples. Coaching and managing career After scouting and player development posts with Houston from 1968 to 1972, Lillis returned to the Astro coaching staff in 1973 and served under managers Leo Durocher, Preston G√≥mez and Bill Virdon. On August 10, , he succeeded Virdon as manager with the club in fifth place in the National League West Division. Lillis led the team to 28 wins in 51 games and was rehired for full seasons from 1983 to 1985. Houston never climbed above second place, however, and even though Lillis compiled a winning 276‚Äì261 (.514) record during that period, he was replaced by Hal Lanier at the close of the 1985 campaign. The following year, Lanier would lead the Astros to a NL West title. He then joined the coaching staff of a former Dodger teammate, Roger Craig, with the San Francisco Giants, and remained with the team for 11 years (through ).

What is essentially a Fats Domino-style boogie and some awful, trite lyrics ('Can't drive, can't do a doggone thing/I'm bugged at my ol' man/And he doesn't even know where it's at') is at least rendered bearable by some wonderfully primitive piano playing and, truth be told, a clich√©d but gorgeous bridge that has Brian Wilson's stamp all over it.\\" Author Peter Ames Carlin described the track as \\"a tossed- off piano blues number\\" and \\"one of the weirdest pieces of humor to ever turn up on anyone's album.\\" Personnel Credits from Craig Slowinski. *Brian Wilson (Credited as \\"Too Embarrassed\\") ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, piano *Carl Wilson ‚Äì backing vocals *Dennis Wilson ‚Äì backing vocals *Marilyn Wilson ‚Äì backing vocals References Category:1965 songs Category:Blues songs Category:Comedy rock songs Category:The Beach Boys songs Category:Songs written by Brian Wilson Category:Song recordings produced by Brian Wilson Category:Songs about fathers ","title":"I'm Bugged at My Ol' Man"},{"id":"4833171","text":"\\"And Your Dream Comes True\\" is an a cappella song written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love for the American rock band The Beach Boys.

This photo was taken of the south facing elevation at noon in December, a little before the Winter Solstice. Note how all the windows are in the shade. Brise soleil, sometimes brise-soleil (; ), is an architectural feature of a building that reduces heat gain within that building by deflecting sunlight. More recently, vertical Brise soleil have become popular. Both systems allow low-level sun to enter a building in the mornings, evenings and during winter but cut out direct light during summer. Architecture Brise-soleil can comprise a variety of permanent sun-shading structures, ranging from the simple patterned concrete walls popularized by Le Corbusier in the Palace of Assembly to the elaborate wing-like mechanism devised by Santiago Calatrava for the Milwaukee Art Museum or the mechanical, pattern-creating devices of the Institut du Monde Arabe by Jean Nouvel. In the typical form, a horizontal projection extends from the sunside facade of a building. This is most commonly used to prevent facades with a large amount of glass from overheating during the summer. Often louvers are incorporated into the shade to prevent the high- angle summer sun falling on the facade, but also to allow the low-angle winter sun to provide some passive solar heating.

Some common statistical procedures assume that variances of the populations from which different samples are drawn are equal. Levene's test assesses this assumption. It tests the null hypothesis that the population variances are equal (called homogeneity of variance or homoscedasticity). If the resulting p-value of Levene's test is less than some significance level (typically 0.05), the obtained differences in sample variances are unlikely to have occurred based on random sampling from a population with equal variances. Thus, the null hypothesis of equal variances is rejected and it is concluded that there is a difference between the variances in the population. Some of the procedures typically assuming homoscedasticity, for which one can use Levene's tests, include analysis of variance and t-tests. Levene's test is often used before a comparison of means. When Levene's test shows significance, one should switch to more generalized tests that is free from homoscedasticity assumptions (sometimes even non-parametric tests). Welch's t-test, or unequal variances t-test are more conservative test. Levene's test may also be used as a main test for answering a stand-alone question of whether two sub-samples in a given population have equal or different variances. Definition Levene's test is equivalent to a 1-way between- groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the dependent variable being the absolute value of the difference between a score and the mean of the group to which the score belongs (shown below as Z_{ij} = Y_{ij} - \\\\bar{Y}_{i\\\\cdot} ). The test statistic, W, is equivalent to the F statistic that would be produced by such an ANOVA, and is defined as follows: : W = \\\\frac{(N-k)}{(k-1)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k N_i (Z_{i\\\\cdot}-Z_{\\\\cdot\\\\cdot})^2} {\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} (Z_{ij}-Z_{i\\\\cdot})^2}, where * k is the number of different groups to which the sampled cases belong, * N_i is the number of cases in the ith group, * N is the total number of cases in all groups, * Y_{ij} is the value of the measured variable for thejth case from the ith group, * Z_{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} Y_{ij} - \\\\bar{Y}_{i\\\\cdot}, & \\\\bar{Y}_{i\\\\cdot} \\\\text{ is a mean of the } i\\\\text{-th group}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y_{ij} - \\\\tilde{Y}_{i\\\\cdot}, & \\\\tilde{Y}_{i\\\\cdot} \\\\text{ is a median of the } i\\\\text{-th group}. \\\\end{cases} (Both definitions are in use though the second one is, strictly speaking, the Brown‚ÄìForsythe test ‚Äì see below for comparison.) * Z_{i\\\\cdot} = \\\\frac{1}{N_i} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} Z_{ij} is the mean of the Z_{ij} for group i, * Z_{\\\\cdot\\\\cdot} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} Z_{ij} is the mean of all Z_{ij}. The test statistic W is approximately F-distributed with k-1 and N-k degrees of freedom, and hence is the significance of the outcome w of W tested against F(\\\\alpha,k-1,N-k) where F is a quantile of the F-distribution, with k-1 and N-k degrees of freedom, and \\\\alpha is the chosen level of significance (usually 0.05 or 0.01). Comparison with the Brown‚ÄìForsythe test The Brown‚ÄìForsythe test uses the median instead of the mean in computing the spread within each group ( \\\\bar{Y} vs. \\\\tilde{Y}, above). Although the optimal choice depends on the underlying distribution, the definition based on the median is recommended as the choice that provides good robustness against many types of non-normal data while retaining good statistical power. If one has knowledge of the underlying distribution of the data, this may indicate using one of the other choices. Brown and Forsythe performed Monte Carlo studies that indicated that using the trimmed mean performed best when the underlying data followed a Cauchy distribution (a heavy-tailed distribution) and the median performed best when the underlying data followed a chi-squared distribution with four degrees of freedom (a heavily skewed distribution). Using the mean provided the best power for symmetric, moderate-tailed, distributions.

Career =College= Sims grew up in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, California, attended Reseda High School, and then played college soccer at California State University, Northridge from 2003 to 2005, redshirting in 2002. Sims was named the Big West Conference Co-Offensive Player of the Year in the 2003 and 2004 seasons, and NSCAA First-Team All- American in the 2005 season. CSUN made the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship tournament all three seasons that Sims was on the team. =Professional= Sims was drafted in the second round (23rd overall) of the 2006 MLS SuperDraft by New England Revolution. He saw little time in his rookie season, but showed much potential for the Revolution, and was praised by Revolution head coach Steve Nicol.New England Revolution: The big questions Sims led the Revolution's reserve squad in the 2006 season with 3 goals in ten games (the entire team only scored 9). His best performance for New England came in a pre-season exhibition match against Bermuda U-21 team, in which he scored 3 goals. He also had an assist in a mid-season exhibition against Scottish giants Celtic. During his second year, Sims only saw regular time for the reserves, so the New England management decided to loan out Sims to the USL First Division side Puerto Rico Islanders to gain more experience and minutes. Sims made ten appearances for the Islanders, and became the first Islanders player ever to score a hattrick (against Miami FC on August 19). Sims returned to New England for the final few months of the season, but was waived at the end of 2007. He subsequently signed for PDL side San Fernando Valley Quakes, where his brother Oscar has also played, and played one game for them against Ventura County Fusion, before signing with Miami FC of the USL First Division in June 2008. Sims spent the rest of the 2008 USL season with Miami FC in the USL First Division, playing nine games during the final couple of months of the year, before and then travelled home to Guatemala when he signed with Suchitep√©quez of the Liga Nacional de F√∫tbol de Guatemala in October 2008. Sims was released by Suchitep√©quez in early 2009 and, having been unable to secure a professional contract elsewhere, signed for Hollywood United Hitmen in the USL Premier Development League in June. He made his debut, and scored his first goal for the team, on June 4, 2009, in a 3-2 loss to Ventura County Fusion. After starting the 2010 PDL season with the Hitmen he was released during the campaign, and switched to their league rivals Ventura County Fusion. After spending a year out of the game in 2011, Sims signed to play for the Los Angeles Misioneros in the USL Premier Development League in 2012. =International= Sims's name is often discussed as a potential player for the Guatemalan National Team. Sims was born in Guatemala, and his father Oscar played for the national team and in the Guatemalan League. Before the 2006 MLS SuperDraft, Sims said he had no interest in playing for La Azul y Blanco, and that he was even considering becoming an American citizen, in hopes of one day playing for the U.S. National Team. By November 2006, Sims had changed his position, telling La Opini√≥n that he would be interested in playing for Guatemala in the UNCAF Nations Cup 2007, and nearly joining the squad for a friendly against Venezuela on November 15. Sims finally made his debut for the Guatemalan national team on 17 November 2007 in a game against Honduras, coming off the bench in the 85th minute. It was his first appearance at any national level, having been ignored by Guatemala at youth level in spite of his college performances.

He was one of Ibn Saud's most devoted supporters and a key lieutenant in the early military campaigns. Early life Sa'ad was born in 1888. He was the youngest son of Abdul Rahman from his marriage to Sara bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. His full- siblings were Faisal, Noura, Abdulaziz, Bazza and Haya. Arrest and death In 1912 Saad was sent by Abdulaziz to meet Sharif Hussein who came in Nifi to build a good relationship with him. However, he was attacked and captured in Al 'Iridh area by the Al Shiyabiyn clan belonged to the 'Utaybah tribe. His companion Faraj ibn Lihif, on the other hand, was killed in the same incident. Saad was brought to Sharif Hussein. Then he sent an envoy, Khalid ibn Luai who was the Amir of Al Khurmah, to Abdulaziz indicating that he should accept the sovereignty of the Ottoman government in the region as well as to pay an annual sum of money to the Ottoman government for Saad's release. Abdulaziz accepted all these requests signing a paper, and Saad was released. Saad was later killed in the battle of Kinzaan against the Ajman tribe in 1915. In the same battle Abdulaziz was wounded. The Ajman tribe forces were led by the maternal grandfather of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Personal life right One of Sa'ad's wives was Tarfa bint Abdullah's sister who was the mother of King Faisal. Sa'ad's another wife was Jawhara bint Saad Al Sudairi. Following the death of Sa'ad she married Abdulaziz with whom she had at least four children, including Saad, Musaed and Abdul Muhsin. Sa'ad's sons, Faisal, Fahd and Saud, were taken in by Abdulaziz and raised as part of his own family. They later married into the King's family. Faisal bin Saad married Abdulaziz's daughter Sara bint Abdulaziz.

Its implementing regulations, the Defense Priorities and Allocation System (DPAS), are located at 15 CFR ¬ß¬ß700 to 700.93. Since 1950, the Act has been reauthorized over 50 times. It has been periodically amended and remains in force. Provisions The Act contains three major sections. The first authorizes the president to require businesses to accept and prioritize contracts for materials deemed necessary for national defense, regardless of a loss incurred on business. The law also allows the president to designate materials to be prohibited from hoarding or price gouging. The law does not state what would occur if a business refuses or is unable to complete a request on time. However, any person who performs any act prohibited or willfully fails to perform any act required by the Defense Production Act may be charged with a felony that results in a fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to one year or both. The second section authorizes the president to establish mechanisms (such as regulations, orders or agencies) to allocate materials, services and facilities to promote national defense. The third section authorizes the president to control the civilian economy so that scarce and critical materials necessary to the national defense effort are available for defense needs. The Act also authorizes the President to requisition property, force industry to expand production and the supply of basic resources, settle labor disputes, control consumer and real estate credit, establish contractual priorities, and allocate raw materials towards national defense. The president's designation of products under the jurisdiction of the DPA is the authority of the Act most often used by the Department of Defense (DOD) since the 1970s. Most of the other functions of the Act are administered by the Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security (SIES) in the Bureau of Industry and Security in the Department of Commerce. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System institutes a rating system for contracts and purchase orders.DCMA Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) The highest priority is DX, which must be approved by the Secretary of Defense. The next level down is DO, and below that are unrated contracts. Use =Korean War= The DPA, passed by the U.S. Congress in September 1950, was first used during the Korean War to establish a large defense mobilization infrastructure and bureaucracy. Under the authority of the Act, President Harry S. Truman eventually established the Office of Defense Mobilization, instituted wage and price controls, strictly regulated production in heavy industries such as steel and mining, prioritized and allocated industrial materials in short supply, and ordered the dispersal of wartime manufacturing plants across the nation. =Cold War= The Act also played a vital role in the establishment of the domestic aluminum and titanium industries in the 1950s. Using the Act, DOD provided capital and interest-free loans, and directed mining and manufacturing resources as well as skilled laborers to these two processing industries. The DPA was also used in the 1950s to ensure that government-funded industries were geographically dispersed across the United States to prevent the industrial base from being destroyed by a single nuclear attack. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the DPA increasingly was used to diversify the US energy mix by funding the trans-Alaskan pipeline, the US synthetic fuels corporation, and research into liquefied natural gas. =Technological innovation= Beginning in the 1980s, the DOD began using the contracting and spending provisions of the DPA to provide seed money to develop new technologies.National Research Council, Defense Manufacturing in 2010 and Beyond, 1999. The DOD has used the act to help develop a number of new technologies and materials, including silicon carbide ceramics, indium phosphide and gallium arsenide semiconductors, microwave power tubes, radiation-hardened microelectronics, superconducting wire, metal composites and the mining and processing of rare earth minerals.Pentagon Invests in Strategic Metals Mine, Seeking to Blunt Chinese Dominance , The Wall Street Journal =21st-century = In 2011, President Barack Obama invoked the law to force telecommunications companies, under criminal penalties, to provide detailed information to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security on the use of foreign- manufactured hardware and software in the companies' networks, as part of efforts to combat Chinese cyberespionage. On June 13, 2017, President Donald Trump invoked the law to classify two sets of products as \\"critical to national defense\\". The first referenced \\"items affecting aerospace structures and fibers, radiation-hardened microelectronics, radiation test and qualification facilities, and satellite components and assemblies\\". The second referenced \\"items affecting adenovirus vaccine production capability; high strength, inherently fire and ballistic resistant, co-polymer aramid fibers industrial capability; secure hybrid composite shipping container industrial capability; and three-dimensional ultra-high density microelectronics for information protection industrial capability\\".  COVID-19  On March 18, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, President Trump issued an executive order that defined ventilators and protective equipment as \\"essential to the national defense\\", the standard required by the DPA. Later that day, he indicated that he would not make immediate use of DPA authority, writing, \\"Hopefully there will be no need\\"; he indicated that he would do so in a \\"worst-case scenario\\". Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called upon Trump to \\"immediately use the powers of the DPA\\" to produce and distribute critically needed hospital equipment. On March 20, Trump said that he will use the DPA. The next day General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra spoke to Trump administration officials about how GM could support production of ventilators without the use of DPA. On March 23, Trump issued an executive order classifying \\"health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19\\" as subject to the authority granted by DPA to prohibit hoarding and price gouging. Trump's initial reluctance to use the act's authorities prompted criticism. On March 27, 2020, after negotiations with GM had broken down over costs, estimated at over $1 billion, but primarily due to GM's inability to commit delivering the number of ventilators required speedily, Trump ordered HHS Secretary Alex Azar to use the DPA to require GM to accept and prioritize contracts for as many ventilators as Azar determines to be appropriate. Trump also named Peter Navarro national policy coordinator for the DPA. On April 2, Trump said he was invoking the DPA to require 3M, General Electric, and Medtronic to increase its production of protective masks (N-95 respirators). On April 28, Trump announced that he intends to issue an executive order under the Defense Production Act mandating that plants producing beef, pork, poultry and eggs stay open. White House General Counsel Pat Cipollone consulted with various companies \\"to design a federal mandate to keep the plants open and to provide them additional virus testing capacity as well as protective gear,\\" according to Bloomberg News. Trump mentioned to the press that the order is intended to \\"solve any liability problems\\" by workers and local authorities to close meat-processing plants for cleaning. The order gave USDA extraordinary powers to have firms maintain production. The order does not allow companies to ignore safety rules (except for keeping the plants opened), however, and OSHA / CDC guidance remains in force. In September 2020, OSHA fined Smithfield and JBS for failing to take the necessary actions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2020/09/smithfield-appeals-osha- fine-for-not-protecting-meat-plant-employees-from- covid-19/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/billion-dollar-meatpacking- companies-fined-total-of-dollar30000-after-10-worker-covid- deaths-1600-infections/ar-BB18Yte7 See also *Nationalization References =Bibliography= *Bell, Douglas, \\"'A Little-known Bill of Great National Significance': The Uses and Evolution of the Defense Production Act, 1950-2020.\\" US Army Heritage and Education Center Historical Services Division.

R. Tedder, 'Todd, Alpheus (1821‚Äì1884)', rev. Elizabeth Baigent, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 23 Feb 2007.  Life  Todd was born in London, England, the son of an author, Henry Cooke Todd. His family emigrated to York, Upper Canada in 1833. The following year, York was incorporated as the city of Toronto; Todd, though young, produced an Engraved Plan of the City of Toronto, which brought him to the attention of the prominent lawyer, Robert Baldwin Sullivan. In 1835, Sullivan helped Todd obtain employment in the library of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada; in 1836 he became assistant librarian. Drawing on his experience in the House of Assembly's library and a keen interest in British parliamentary practice and its application in Canada and other British colonies, Todd published The Practice and Privileges of the Two Houses of Parliament in 1840. When, in 1841, Upper and Lower Canada were merged, Todd was appointed assistant librarian to the Legislative Assembly of the united province, which adopted his Practice and Privileges as an official guide for members. On March 31, 1856 Todd became chief librarian of the Assembly. Upon confederation in 1867, he was appointed librarian to the Dominion Parliament, a position he would hold until his death. Beginning in 1867, he wrote and published his most important work, On Parliamentary Government in England, an epic two-volume treatise on the British constitution and its conventions, including an examination of parliamentary privilege, and a defence of executive authority and the Royal Prerogative. The work was widely acclaimed in Britain and across the Empire, establishing its author as an authority on constitutional matters. The book ran to several editions, and was soon translated into French, German, Spanish, and Italian. Notably, the Parliamentary Library survived \\"because of the foresight of librarian Alpheus Todd and clerk Connie MacCormac. Todd had insisted to the architect on iron fire doors, and MacCormac ordered the doors to be slammed shut before evacuating.' In the 1881 Birthday Honours, Todd was created a companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on the recommendation of the Marquess of Lorne, and was awarded an honorary LLD by Queen's College, Kingston. He was a founding member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1882. Todd died suddenly at Ottawa on January 22, 1884.  Family  Todd married Sarah Anne St John in 1845. Together, they had one daughter and four sons, one of whom, Arthur Hamlyn Todd, published second editions of his father's two works on Parliamentary Government, and left an unpublished life of him.

History Ultimately, the goal was to do long-range and continuous planning to prepare the United States for adequate industrial and economic mobilization. The board was originally very ineffective, perhaps because authority was shared by all eight members of the board rather than any single point person. In 1949, this was changed on the recommendation of the Hoover Commission. All power was vested in the chairman alone, and the board was moved to be part of the Department of Defense. Later, it was shifted to the Executive Office of the President. Its role was later eliminated when its responsibilities were transferred to the Office of Defense Mobilization in June 1953. Mission The organization had the following statutory duties: *policies concerning industrial and civilian mobilization in order to assure the most effective mobilization and maximum utilization of the Nation's manpower in the event of war. *programs for the effective use in time of war of the Nation's natural and industrial resources for military and civilian needs, for the maintenance and stabilization of the civilian economy in time of war, and for the adjustment of such economy to war needs and conditions; *policies for unifying, in time of war, the activities of Federal agencies and departments engaged in or concerned with production, procurement, distribution, or transportation of military or civilian supplies, materials, and products; *the relationship between potential supplies of, and potential requirements for, manpower, resources, and productive facilities in time of war; *policies for establishing adequate reserves of strategic and critical material, and for the conservation of these reserves; *the strategic relocation of industries, services, government, and economic activities, the continuous operation of which is essential to the Nation's security. Structure The board was composed of eight members, one of whom served as its chairman. In addition, at the time of its creation, the chairman of the National Security Resources Board also served ex officio as one of only seven permanent members of the National Security Council. The first chairman was businessman Arthur M. Hill.

The river supports a variety of wildlife including trout, snapping turtles, leeches, and many other varieties of flora and fauna. The Black River watershed encompasses across two counties and 13 townships. The main course of the river is formed by the confluence of the North Branch Black River and Middle Branch Black River at , northwest of South Haven. The South Branch Black River joins the main course at . The North Branch Black River is formed out of the Black River Drain, which rises out of a complex of drains including the Leverich Drain and North State Road Drain in Clyde Township and Ganges Township in Allegan County. The Middle Branch Black River is formed by the junction of the Little Bear Lake Drain and Melvin Creek at in southern Lee Township, near the boundary with Van Buren County. The South Branch Black River is formed by the junction of the Lower Jeptha Lake Drain and the Black River Extension Drain at in Columbia Township near Breedsville. About three miles above its mouth on Lake Michigan, the river forks, with the South Branch draining Van Buren County. Less than three miles further upstream, the river forks again into the Middle and North Branches. The Middle branch drains areas of both Van Buren and Allegan counties, and the North Branch watershed is entirely in Allegan County.

It consists of the village Chi»õcani and two small villages (hamlets), Merene»ôti and Zahorna.Clasificatorul unitƒÉ»õilor administrativ-teritoriale al Republicii Moldova (CUATM) Chi»õcani is situated to the south-east of the city of Tighina (Bender). The locality, although situated on the right (western) bank of the river Dniester, is under the control of the breakaway Transnistrian authorities. On the opposite side of the river lies the city of Tiraspol. Chi»õcani is one of the oldest recorded villages in Moldova, its history dating back to 1367. The name of the village means \\"shrews\\" in Romanian language. The village is also well known as the home of the Noul Neam≈£ Monastery. The monastery was closed when Moldova was under the Soviet Union. It was then used as a hospital, a storehouse, then as a makeshift museum.All Moldova: Chi≈£cani Monastery VisitPMR.com: Kitskani Monastery According to the 2004 census, the population of the commune stands at 9,266 people, of which 4,921 ethnic Russians, 3,153 ethnic Moldovans, and 969 ethnic Ukrainians. At the 1930 Romanian Census, there were 4,744 inhabitants in Chi»õcani, including the 2,456 Romanians, 2,146 Russians, 71 Ruthenians and Ukrainians, 35 Jews, 16 Gypsies, 7 Poles, 3 Bulgarians, 2 Gagauzians, and 8 unclear. 2,426 people named Romanian as native language, 2,245 named Russian, 35 named Yiddish, 27 named Ukrainian, 5 named Gypsy, 3 named Bulgarian, 2 named Turkish, and 1 non- declared. At the time, the village was part of Plasa CƒÉu»ôani of Tighina County. During the 1992 War of Transnistria, especially during the months of June and July, Chi»õcani was the scene of several gun-battles between the Moldovan police and army on one side, and Transnistrian separatists and Russia's 14th Army on the other side. After the Moldovans have retreated when the war ended, the village was the scene of human rights abuses perpetrated by the Transnistrians, who took revenge on the locals that supported the Moldovan police. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Moldova, there were some alleged 20 killings between 1996 and 2000. Moldovan authorities have stated that they have no access to the village to investigate these cases, while Transnistrian authorities denied the allegations and refused to investigate.Interview on Transnistria with Stefan Uritu, reporter Mrs Sara Engstrum, Sweden Angstorm article in \\"AdevƒÉrul\\" (Romanian)  References  Category:Communes of CƒÉu»ôeni District Category:Populated places under Transnistrian control Category:Bessarabia Governorate ","title":"Chi»õcani"},{"id":"4833502","text":"Optic Nerve is an interactive CD-ROM showcasing the life and work of multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz.

This wave occurs at frequencies similar to the mu wave, although the alpha wave is detected over a different part of the brain. The left motor cortex, or BA4, is highlighted in green on this left lateral view of the brain. This is the area over which mu waves are detected bilaterally. Mu waves, also known as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or sensorimotor rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5‚Äì12.5 (and primarily 9‚Äì11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called desynchronization of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree. The mu wave is of interest to a variety of scholars. Scientists who study neural development are interested in the details of the development of the mu wave in infancy and childhood and its role in learning. Since a group of researchers believe that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly influenced by an altered mirror neuron system and that mu wave suppression is a downstream indication of mirror neuron activity, many of these scientists have kindled a more popular interest in investigating the mu wave in people with ASD. Assorted investigators are also in the process of using mu waves to develop a new technology: the brain-computer interface (BCI). With the emergence of BCI systems, clinicians hope to give the severely physically disabled population new methods of communication and a means to manipulate and navigate their environments. Mirror neurons The mirror neuron system consists of a class of neurons that was first studied in the 1990s in macaque monkeys. Studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when the monkeys view others performing the same simple tasks. This suggests they play a role in mapping others' movements into the brain without actually physically performing the movements. These sets of neurons are called mirror neurons and together make up the mirror neuron system. Mu waves are suppressed when these neurons fire, a phenomenon which allows researchers to study mirror neuron activity in humans. There is evidence that mirror neurons exist in humans as well as in non-human animals. The right fusiform gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, right anterior parietal cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus are of particular interest. Some researchers believe that mu wave suppression can be a consequence of mirror neuron activity throughout the brain, and represents a higher-level integrative processing of mirror neuron activity. Tests in both monkeys (using invasive measuring techniques) and humans (using EEG and fMRI) have found that these mirror neurons not only fire during basic motor tasks, but also have components that deal with intention. There is evidence of an important role for mirror neurons in humans, and mu waves may represent a high level coordination of those mirror neurons. Development A fruitful conceptualization of mu waves in pediatric use is that mu wave suppression is a representation of activity going on in the world, and is detectable in the frontal and parietal networks. A resting oscillation becomes suppressed during the observation of sensory information such as sounds or sights, usually within the frontoparietal (motor) cortical region. The mu wave is detectable during infancy as early as four to six months, when the peak frequency the wave reaches can be as low as 5.4 Hz. There is a rapid increase in peak frequency in the first year of life, and by age two frequency typically reaches 7.5 Hz. The peak frequency of the mu wave increases with age until maturation into adulthood, when it reaches its final and stable frequency of 8‚Äì13 Hz. These varying frequencies are measured as activity around the central sulcus, within the Rolandic cortex. Mu waves are thought to be indicative of an infant‚Äôs developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital role in the development of motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants‚Äô mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language. =Autism= Autism is a disorder that is associated with social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits. fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism, but not in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus is one of the main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success. Brain-computer interfaces Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a developing technology that clinicians hope will one day bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology has the potential to help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with tetraplegia (quadriplegia) or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools. Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an \\"event\\"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method. History Mu waves have been studied since the 1930s, and are referred to as the wicket rhythm because the rounded EEG waves resemble croquet wickets. In 1950, Henri Gastaut and his coworkers reported desynchronization of these waves not only during active movements of their subjects, but also while the subjects observed actions executed by someone else. These results were later confirmed by additional research groups, including a study using subdural electrode grids in epileptic patients. The latter study showed mu suppression while the patients observed moving body parts in somatic areas of the cortex that corresponded to the body part moved by the actor. Further studies have shown that the mu waves can also be desynchronized by imagining actions and by passively viewing point-light biological motion.

Samuel Pryor was elected the first mayor along with a Marshal, a treasurer-recorder, and six aldermen.. By Jackie McElhaney and Michael V. Hazel. Retrieved 20 April 2006. By 1859, Dallas had its first barber shop and a photographer. By 1860, the town's population reached 678, including 97 African Americans as well as Belgians, French, Germans, and Swiss. By that year, the railroad was approaching from the south, and several stage lines were already passing through the city.Dallas Historical Society - Dallas History . Retrieved 21 April 2006.  Fire of 1860  1860 was a very rough year for the city as it began to prepare for war. Public debates on the issue of secession were held and a volunteer militia was started. In July 1860, a fire broke out in the square, destroying most of the buildings in the business district of Dallas. Many residents assumed that slaves were behind it and two abolitionists were run out of town. Three African-American slaves were hanged, and all other slaves in Dallas were ordered to be whipped. By December of that year, most of the city had been rebuilt. The population was growing so quickly that housing was frequently in short supply.  Civil War  In 1861, Dallas County voted 741‚Äì237 in favor of secession. On 8 June of that year, a state of war was declared, and citizens were very supportive of the effort. The town was decorated and parades were held, and there was no shortage of volunteers. Since Dallas was so far from the actual fighting, citizens gave money, flour, and other supplies to the Confederate cause. A munitions factory was also built in the city. When the Union Army began to approach Mississippi and Louisiana, the cotton that was typically shipped there was instead shipped to Dallas.  Reconstruction  The Reconstruction period brought many challenges for Dallas. On 19 June 1865 (Juneteenth), Texan slaves were liberated. Many African Americans came to Dallas after the war because the city was still prosperous compared to many other Southern cities. Freedmen's towns were scattered throughout Dallas and many whites became fearful -- the Ku Klux Klan first appeared in the city in 1868. Many Southerners who had been hurt financially during the war came to Dallas to rebuild their fortunes. They couldn't maintain plantations anymore, but North Texas' farm land meant opportunity. Dallas continued to grow during the Reconstruction years, unlike many Southern towns that still had the task of major rebuilding at hand. By this time, Dallas had also become the center of the buffalo market. In 1871, Dallas legally became a city. Politics during the Reconstruction proved to be quite difficult. During the first elections, the voter registration board only allowed supporters of African American suffrage to vote. In 1872, Edmund J. Davis, then governor of Texas, ordered Henry Ervay, then mayor of Dallas, to be removed from office. He refused and was jailed. The state supreme court ruled that the governor did not have the power to remove officials from office, and Ervay was released.  Railroad convergence  Map of central Dallas c. 1871 In 1871, railroads were beginning to approach the area and Dallas city leaders did not intend to stand idly and be left out. They paid the Houston and Central Texas Railroad US$5,000 to shift its route to the west and build its north‚Äìsouth tracks through Dallas, rather than through Corsicana as planned. A year later, Dallas leaders could not pay the Texas and Pacific Railway to locate there, so they devised a way to trick the Railroad--Dallas had a rider attached to a state law which required the railroad to build its tracks through Browder Springs--which turned out to be just south of Main Street. The major north‚Äìsouth and east- west Texas railroad routes intersected in Dallas in 1873, thus ensuring its future as a commercial center. The arrival of the trains also meant soaring populations -- the population of Dallas shot from 3,000 in early 1872 to more than 7,000 in September of the same year. New buildings and new businesses appeared daily. Telegraph lines came to Dallas, connecting it with the rest of the world. Dallas became the center of the markets for raw materials like grains and cotton that was being shipped to the south and east. It was also the \\"last chance\\" for people traveling west to get supplies. Large, ornate hotels were constructed in the city but many buildings remained utilitarian and plain. Water and gas also became available, and in 1871, the first volunteer fire company, Dallas Hook and Ladder Company #1, was organized.

The informal gatherings of Jack London, George Sterling, and Herman Whitaker, along with others, eventually became formalized as the Press Club of Alameda. In 1909, a break-off group from that club formed the California Writers Club with Austin Lewis serving as the club's first president. A quarterly bulletin under the guidance of Dr. William S. Morgan was established in 1912. The club finally incorporated in 1913, choosing the motto Sail On from the Joaquin Miller poem, \\"Columbus\\". The general purposes of the California Writers Club are to provide a forum for literary criticism and for recognition of achievement, to discover new authors and assist them in developing their talent, and to sponsor educational meetings to promote professional growth. History Early members of the club included Jack London, George Sterling, John Muir, Joaquin Miller, and the first California poet laureate, Ina Coolbrith. In 1914, the first edition of West Winds, a hardcover collection of fiction by members, was published. It was illustrated by local California artists. Since that time three other West Winds have been published. The California Writers Club organized literary events in the prewar period; the first California Writers Club Conference was held in Oakland in 1941. The California Writers Club also organized social events with a literary orientation. =Notable Members= * Winifred Davidson * Belle Willey Gue *Stella Wynne Herron * Vingie E. Roe * Geneve L. A.

Each attracts from 100 to 400 writers and dozens of literary agents, editors, authors, and publishers from all over the United States to present lectures, workshops, and panel discussions on all aspects of the writing life. Writers Memorial Grove at Joaquin Miller Park in Oakland celebrates California's great writers with the planting of trees. The first tree was planted for Joaquin Miller.

In 2003, the California Writers Club worked to establish a week to celebrate and recognize California Writers. The result of this effort occurred on September 4, 2003 when the California State Assembly officially declared the third week in October of each year as California Writers Week (Members Resolution No. 2170). The Resolution is endorsed by the California Library Association. Every other year, each branch selects one member to receive a Jack London Service Award in recognition of their contributions to the Club.

From the 1870s the Society faced financial difficulty and high rent and empty coffers forced the RAS to look for a new venue. The City Council offered 40 acres of unpromising, sandy scrub at Moore Park for an annual rent of ¬£10. With the help of the NSW Government and public subscriptions the Society built a showground, which saw the show move from Prince Alfred Park and remain for the next 115 years. The Society had become the Royal Agricultural Society in 1891, when Queen Victoria gave her permission for the usage of \\"Royal\\". The Royal Agricultural Society Showground also became an important part of the history of rugby league in Australia, hosting some of the new code's first matches. The Royal Agricultural Society Shield was designated the newly formed NSWRFL Premiership's main trophy in 1908. During World War II the Sydney Royal Easter Show was cancelled when Moore Park was requisitioned for military use. By the late 1980s the Sydney Royal Easter Show had outgrown its Moore Park facilities. In 1994 the NSW Government approved its relocation to Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush. The first Show was held there in 1998.

The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 12 and NY 26 in the Lewis County village of Lowville. Its northern terminus is at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border in Ogdensburg, where it crosses the Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge and connects to Highway 16 in Ontario. While most of NY 812 passes through rural areas of the North Country, the route also serves several villages and small communities. The GPS services company Geotab has named it the quietest highway in New York due to its low traffic counts. The origins of NY 812 date back to the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when the portion of modern NY 812 from Lowville to Croghan became part of NY 26A and the segment of modern NY 812 between De Kalb and Ogdensburg was designated as the northernmost portion of New York State Route 87\\\\. NY 87 originally extended as far south as Harrisville; however, it was truncated north to Edwards in the 1940s and farther north to De Kalb in the 1970s. On July 1, 1977, all of NY 87 and the Lowville‚ÄìCroghan leg of NY 26A were replaced with NY 812, a new route that began in Lowville and passed through Croghan, Harrisville, Gouverneur, and De Kalb before ending near Ogdensburg. At the time, two sections of the route‚Äîfrom the Croghan village line to a point west of Harrisville and from Harrisville to Fowler‚Äîwere maintained by the counties that they passed through, and a piece between NY 126 and the Croghan village line was maintained by the village itself. The state of New York assumed maintenance of the Croghan‚ÄìHarrisville segment in 1980 and took over the Harrisville‚ÄìFowler section in 1982. Route description =Lewis County= NY 812 begins at an intersection with NY 12 and NY 26 in the center of village of Lowville, which is located in the town of the same name. NY 26, concurrent with NY 12 south of this point, leaves NY 12 and follows NY 812 for several blocks along North State Street before NY 812 turns northeast onto Bostwick Street. Just before Bostwick ends at East State Street, NY 812 turns off and begins its progression northward through a largely rural area of the North Country. As it exits the village of Lowville (but remains in the town of the same name), it begins to parallel the western bank of the Black River. The two entities remain close for roughly before NY 812 crosses over the river and enters New Bremen. Southern terminus of NY 812 in Lowville In the hamlet of New Bremen, NY 812 intersects County Route 33 (CR 33), a riverside roadway bypassing both Croghan and Beaver Falls along the east bank of the Black River, southwest of Duflo Airport. NY 812 continues onward, crossing the Black Creek as it enters Croghan, a village situated on the New Bremen‚ÄìCroghan town line. At the center of the community, NY 812 meets the eastern terminus of NY 126. Outside of Croghan, NY 812 traverses the Beaver River just north of the village line. The route and the river continue northward along parallel routings for a brief distance before the two separate near the hamlet of High Falls. While the river curves east toward the hamlet, NY 812 presses northward through the rural hamlets of Indian River and Dutton Corners into the town of Diana, where NY 812 starts to parallel the west branch of the Oswegatchie River as both continue north through the town. At Tylers Corners, NY 812 intersects NY 3 and joins the route eastward into Harrisville, where the conjoined routes cross over the Oswegatchie. Northeast of Harrisville in extreme southwestern St. Lawrence County, NY 812 breaks from NY 3 and heads northwest through Pitcairn (crossing over the Oswegatchie once more in the process). =St. Lawrence County= NY 812 southbound from NY 126 in Croghan From Harrisville, NY 812 travels north through an area of Pitcairn and Fowler. This area contains numerous small lakes and rivers and is predominantly rural in nature. Within Fowler, the route serves the hamlet of Balmat (located on the eastern edge of Sylvia Lake) before intersecting NY 58 in the hamlet of Fowler. Here, NY 812 joins NY 58 northeast along the southern bank of the now-unified Oswegatchie River to the village of Gouverneur, located in the town of the same name, where NY 812 leaves NY 58 but joins U.S. Route 11 (US 11) at the heart of the community. Outside of the village, US 11 and NY 812 head northeast, roughly paralleling the Oswegatchie once more into the De Kalb village of Richville. The routes quickly exit the village and separate shortly thereafter south of the hamlet of De Kalb, with the Oswegatchie leaving the path of US 11 and following NY 812\\\\. NY 812 heads north, serving De Kalb and crossing over the Oswegatchie south of an intersection with CR 14, a connector leading to Rensselaer Falls that was once NY 186\\\\. Here, NY 812 begins to the northwest as it approaches the village of Heuvelton. The northern terminus looking south from the Odgensburg-Prescott International Bridge Within the village, located in the town of Oswegatchie, NY 812, here known as State Street, intersects NY 184 just before traversing the Oswegatchie one final time. The name remains for three blocks before NY 812 departs the village. Farther north, NY 812 passes by the Ogdensburg International Airport before meeting NY 37 at an interchange just south of the Ogdensburg city limits. NY 812 joins NY 37 here, following the route through the southern reaches of the city. The conjoined routes intersect NY 68 before separating near the northeastern city limits. Past NY 37, NY 812 continues onto the Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge over the St. Lawrence River, where it becomes Highway 16 upon crossing the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border into Ontario. History In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, what is now NY 812 between Lowville and Croghan became the southern leg of NY 26A, an alternate route of NY 26 between Lowville and Carthage. Farther north, the portion of modern NY 812 between De Kalb and Ogdensburg became part of NY 87, a route extending from Harrisville to Ogdensburg via Edwards, Russell and De Kalb.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering From Harrisville to Fowler, NY 87 followed a parallel alignment to modern NY 812 along Hands Flats, Stone, and Pitcairn roads, and CR 24\\\\. Between Fowler and De Kalb, NY 87 used what is now NY 58, CR 24, and CR 17 before following current NY 812 north to Ogdensburg. The portion of NY 87 between De Kalb Junction and De Kalb was concurrent with US 11. Both US 11 and NY 87 were shifted south onto a new highway , at which time the former routing of US 11 between the new road and De Kalb became part of NY 87. NY 812 north at NY 126 in Croghan. Prior to the 1970s, NY 26A entered this junction on modern NY 812 and left to the west on current NY 126\\\\. NY 87 was gradually truncated northward over time. The first change to the route's southern end came in the early 1940s when it was moved northeastward to the eastern terminus of its former overlap with NY 58 in Edwards. It was moved once more, this time to what was the west end of its overlap with US 11 in De Kalb, in the early 1970s. In 1975, officials from New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Region 7 proposed eliminating NY 87 in favor of NY 812, a new route that would extend from Lowville to Ogdensburg via Croghan, Harrisville, Gouverneur, and De Kalb. The designation would also supplant NY 26A south of Croghan. The proposed route was part of a larger plan to connect the Delaware River at Deposit to the Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge over the Saint Lawrence River by way of as few numbered routes as possible. All of the suggested changes were implemented on July 1, 1977. When NY 812 was first assigned, it was locally maintained from NY 126 in Croghan to NY 3 in Diana and from NY 3 in Pitcairn to NY 58 in Fowler. The section of the route between NY 126 and the Croghan village line was maintained by the village of Croghan; however, the rest of the two locally maintained sections were maintained by Lewis and St. Lawrence counties. Most of the Lewis County-owned section was co-designated as CR 11; however, the short piece between the Croghan village line and Belfort Road was part of CR 10. In St. Lawrence County, NY 812 was overlaid on the existing CR 73 from NY 3 to Stone Road, CR 99 between Stone Road and Balmat, and CR 56 from Balmat to Fowler. The state of New York assumed ownership and maintenance of NY 812 between Croghan and Diana on April 1, 1980, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Lewis County that transferred NY 194 to the county. Ownership of NY 812 from Pitcairn to Fowler was transferred to the state on September 1, 1982, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and St. Lawrence County.

The Udarata Menike express passenger service from Badulla to Colombo Fort in Sri Lanka was a regular train route which ran on to Colombo. On the day of the accident, the train was grossly over crowded, with hundreds of people clinging to the roof and sideboards because there was not room inside. The train was running over a newly repaired and replaced section of track at high speed, when the engine suddenly derailed at a bend, dragging three coaches with it. Local people and emergency services made their way to the wreckage, and were able to pull many of the injured out of it. Thankfully, it did not catch fire, and the line was cleared rapidly. Fifteen people were killed in the crash, mostly amongst those who had been hanging onto the running boards and had been crushed by the falling train carriages. There were also at least forty people seriously injured in the crash, who were treated at local hospitals. The accident was reported to be the result of the newly laid track, the gravel base of which had not had a chance to settle and harden through the passage of trains overhead. The train driver had not been informed of this, and so allowed a high speed on his extremely over-weight train, which caused the derailment when the gravel bed shifted after the engine had passed. If the driver had known about the weakened railbed, he would probably have moderated his speed.

Like the Mark 8, the Mark 11 was an earth-penetrating weapon, also known as a nuclear bunker buster bomb. The Mk-11 nuclear bomb  Description  As with the Mark 8, the Mark 11 was a gun-type nuclear bomb (see also: gun-type assembly weapon). It used a fixed large target assembly of highly enriched uranium or HEU, a gun-like barrel, and a powder charge and uranium bullet or projectile fired up the barrel into the target. The Mark 11 was first produced in 1956, and was in service until 1960. A total of 40 were produced, replacing but not expanding the quantity of Mark 8 bombs. It was 14 inches in diameter and 147 inches long, with a weight of 3,210 to 3,500 pounds. Yield was reportedly the same as the Mark 8, 25 to 30 kilotons. The two bombs reportedly used the same basic fissile weapon design, but the Mark 11 had a much more modern external casing designed to penetrate further and more reliably into the ground. The Mark 8 had a flat nose, much like a torpedo. The Mark 11 nose was a pointed ogive shape. The MK-11 also known as the MK-91 had variable yields by changing the target rings. A major difference over the MK-8 was that the MK-91 had an electric operated actuator as a safety device that would rotate a spline ring to prevent the projectile from being fired into the target rings. The MK-8 had no safety devices. Upon release from the delivery aircraft detonation would occur after the black powder fuzes burned 90-110 seconds. The MK-91 was a deep penetrating weapon in many surface materials. A \\"PHOEBE\\" polonium initiator increased the nuclear detonation efficiency.

However, nine days later, the Northumbrian king's army was destroyed while Eadberht was leading it between \\"Ouania\\" and \\"Niwanbirig\\",Symeon of Durham, Historia Regum Angliae, in T.

Impetus During the journal's short, three-year existence its various contributors and editors, for example, shown in essays by Wilhelm von Humboldt and Friedrich von Schiller, sought to address, disseminate, and foment ideas and fundamental conceptions concerning art and aesthetic processes and therewith to determine, on cultural and social levels of influence, what characterizes art's essential import and its practice by artists. Alike to Friedrich Schiller's Die Horen, the journal's basic impetus was to extend the reach of classical values in art. Through its German name, \\"Propyl√§en\\" (from the Greek œÄœÅŒøœÄœçŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ, propylaion, pl. œÄœÅŒøœÄœçŒªŒ±ŒπŒ±, propulaia, an entryway to a building), which can be translated to English as \\"Propylaea\\", the periodical, including its various themes, was to represent a uniquely cultural \\"entryway\\"; and thus, it symbolized the building that is life into which the artist is required to enter.

He commanded a small garrison at Fort de la Boulaye on the lower Mississippi River, built in 1700, and founded Fort St Jean Baptiste de Natchitoches in northern La Louisiane, as they called the French colony. Early life and education St. Denis was born at Beauport, New France (Quebec), the eleventh of the twelve children of Nicolas Juchereau (1627-1692), Seigneur du Chesnay and Saint-Roch-des-Aulnaies; member of the Sovereign Council of New France. His paternal grandfather was the elder brother of No√´l Juchereau des Chatelets. His mother, Marie Th√©r√®se Giffard de Beauport, was the daughter of Robert Giffard de Moncel, Sieur de Moncel √† Autheuil, and the 1st Seigneur of Beauport, Quebec. His brother was the grandfather of Louis Barbe Juchereau de Saint-Denys (1740-1833), 1st Marquis de Saint-Denys, ancestor of Marie-Jean- L√©on, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys.Famille de Juchereau de Saint-Denys, Juchereau du Chesnay/Duchesnay Monument to St. Denis in Natchitoches, Louisiana. St. Denis' parents apparently were able to send him to France to further his education. In late 1699, St. Denis sailed from La Rochelle with the second expedition of Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville (his first cousin), arriving in Louisiana. St. Denis commanded a small garrison at Fort de La Boulaye, named for a commune in the Bourgogne region of France. The fort was constructed in 1700 on the Mississippi River about 20 kilometers below the future development of New Orleans; it was designed to protect French interests against the Spanish and English in the region. St. Denis also commanded a fort at Biloxi Bay, where the French founded another settlement. St. Denis also explored to the west of the bay and up the Mississippi River, where he journeyed to the lower Red River. These expeditions to the northern areas brought St. Denis into contact with the Karankawa and Caddo tribes and taught him invaluable wilderness skills specific to the area. Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac sent St. Denis and a company of French marines from Mobile in September 1713 to travel up the Red River and establish a French outpost and fort. The intent was to protect the territorial boundaries of French-Louisiana and halt the eastward expansion of the Spaniards, whose local government was based on the Rio Grande in south Texas. The Spaniards were building Fort Los Adaes about 15 miles west of Natchitoches, near the present town of Robeline, LA. St. Denis arrived in central Louisiana at what is now Natchitoches later in 1713 and built Fort St. Jean Baptiste de Natchitoches as a trading post along the banks of the Red River, whose course later changed and the result became the Cane River. He traded with the Caddo Nation there and freely sold them guns; additionally, St. Denis developed a somewhat friendly relationship with the nearby Spaniards, despite the objections of the French governorship. St. Denis and his men learned many hunting and trapping skills from the Caddo Indians, who were welcoming and friendly.Fehrenbach, T. R. Lone Star A History of Texas and the Texans. Collier Books: New York, 1980. pp 41-43. Soon after founding Natchitoches in 1714, St. Denis traveled to the lands of the Hasinai Confederacy, a group of Caddoan language tribes, and from there to Spanish outposts on the Rio Grande. At San Juan Bautista, Coahuila, Commander Diego Ram√≥n placed St. Denis under house arrest. He confiscated his goods while awaiting instructions from Mexico City on what to do with the foreigner charged with violating Spanish trade restrictions. In the meantime, St. Denis courted and won the promise of marriage from Ram√≥n's step- granddaughter, Manuela Sanchez-Navarro a descendant of the conquistadors of the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. St. Denis was ordered to Mexico City and defended himself well enough to be appointed the commissary officer of the Ram√≥n expedition charged with founding Spanish missions in east Texas.Chipman, Donald E. Spanish Texas 1519-1821. University of Texas Press: Austin, 1997. p 105 St. Denis returned to San Juan Bautista and married Manuela in early 1716. In the years 1716-1717 he traveled to eastern Texas to participate in the founding of six missions and a presidio. He returned to San Juan Bautista in April 1717. The death of Louis XIV and the conclusion of the War of Spanish Succession resulted in ending French-Spanish cooperation, and St. Denis returned to La Louisiane. The French sent St. Denis to Mexico City for a second time, but he escaped before being hauled to Spain as a prisoner. St. Denis made his way to Natchitoches by February 1719. Spanish officials permitted Manuela to join him in 1721, and the couple spent their remaining years at the French outpost, Le Poste des Cadodaquious, on the Red River. Later life From his command at Natchitoches, St. Denis was a troublesome thorn in the side of Spanish Texas. Controversy surrounds his motives to this day. St. Denis insisted that he wanted to become a Spanish subject, and his Spanish wife was proof. Suspicious Spaniards saw him as a covert agent of France. St. Denis contributed greatly to the geographical knowledge of both imperial France and imperial Spain, as well as bringing Spanish and French settlements into closer proximity and contact. His contraband trade became a way of life on the frontier and borders of Spanish Texas and French Louisiana. St. Denis Street in the historic district of Natchitoches On 10 January 1743, St. Denis wrote to Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Maurepas, at Versailles, indicating that he could no longer perform his duties as commandant of Natchitoches. He also asked permission to retire to New Spain with his wife and children, but he was forbidden to do so. St. Denis died at Natchitoches on 11 June 1744. He was survived by his wife and five children, one of whom was married briefly to Athanase de M√©zi√®res. After the time of his death, it was rumored that his wife became the richest woman west of the Mississippi River. As St. Denis' two sons did not father any children of their own, his daughters carried his posterity. His descendants include Jefferson J. DeBlanc (1921-2007) and Alcibiades DeBlanc (1821-1883), who founded the Knights of the White Camellia, a post-Civil War white insurgent group in Louisiana. Its goal was to suppress voting by freedmen and regain political power for white men.

Ecosystems are complex and ecological indicators can help describe them in simpler terms that can be understood and used by non- scientists to make management decisions. For example, the number of different beetle taxa found in a field can be used as an indicator of biodiversity. Many different types of indicators have been developed. They can be used to reflect a variety of aspects of ecosystems, including biological, chemical and physical. Due to this variety, the development and selection of ecological indicators is a complex process. Using ecological indicators is a pragmatic approach since direct documentation of changes in ecosystems as related to management measures, is cost and time intensive. For example, it would be expensive and time-consuming to count every bird, plant and animal in a newly restored wetland to see if the restoration was a success. Instead, a few indicator species can be monitored to determine the success of the restoration. :\\"It is difficult and often even impossible to characterize the functioning of a complex system, such as an eco-agrosystem, by means of direct measurements. The size of the system, the complexity of the interactions involved, or the difficulty and cost of the measurements needed are often crippling\\" The terms ecological indicator and environmental indicator are often used interchangeably. However, ecological indicators are actually a sub- set of environmental indicators. Generally, environmental indicators provide information on pressures on the environment, environmental conditions and societal responses. Ecological indicators refer only to ecological processes; however, sustainability indicators are seen as increasingly important for managing humanity's coupled human-environmental systems.Shaker, R. R. (2018). A mega-index for the Americas and its underlying sustainable development correlations. Ecological Indicators, 89, 466-479. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.050 Ecological indicators play an important role in evaluating policy regarding the environment. Indicators contribute to evaluation of policy development by: *Providing decision-makers and the general public with relevant information on the current state and trends in the environment. *Helping decision-makers better understand cause and effect relationships between the choices and practices of businesses and policy-makers versus the environment. *Assisting to monitor and assess the effectiveness of measures taken to increase and enhance ecological goods and services. Based on the United Nations convention to combat desertification and convention for biodiversity, indicators are planned to be built in order to evaluate the evolution of the factors. For instance, for the CCD, the Unesco- funded Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel (OSS) has created the R√©seau d'Observatoires du Sahara et du Sahel (ROSELT) (website ) as a network of cross-Saharan observatories to establish ecological indicators. Limitations There are limitations and challenges to using indicators for evaluating policy programs. For indicators to be useful for policy analysis, it is necessary to be able to use and compare indicator results on different scales (local, regional, national and international). Currently, indicators face the following spatial limitations and challenges: # Variable availability of data and information on local, regional and national scales. # Lack of methodological standards on an international scale. # Different ranking of indicators on an international scale which can result in different legal treatment. # Averaged values across a national level may hide regional and local trends. # When compiled, local indicators may be too diverse to provide a national result. Indicators also face other limitations and challenges, such as: # Lack of reference levels, therefore it is unknown if trends in environmental change are strong or weak. # Indicator measures can overlap, causing over estimation of single parameters. # Long-term monitoring is necessary to identify long-term environmental changes. # Attention to more easily handled measurable indicators distracts from indicators less quantifiable such as aesthetics, ethics or cultural values.

The first version aired on NBC daytime from April 1, 1963 to September 26, 1969 with revivals on ABC in 1975 and in syndication from 1978 to 1979. The last two incarnations were executive produced by Ralph Andrews and produced (with Gary Hunt) and directed by Bill Carruthers. NBC broadcasts were produced by Ralph Andrews-Bill Yagemann Productions in association with Desilu Productions (later Paramount Television). Ralph Andrews Productions produced both of the 1970s versions, with the ABC series produced in association with the Carruthers Company and Warner Bros. Television and the syndicated series produced in association with Viacom Enterprises. Tom Kennedy hosted the original You Don't Say! and the 1975 revival while Jim Peck hosted the 1978 series. John Harlan was the announcer for almost the entire run of the series in its various incarnations, save for part of 1963 when Jay Stewart announced. Similar to the announcer's function on Password, either Stewart or Harlan would whisper the name being guessed, along with a description. Game play =NBC= Two teams competed, each composed of a celebrity and a contestant. The object was to convey the name of a famous person by giving clues, leading to words that sounded like part of the person's name (near the end of the run, places were also used as subjects). The contestant then had to sound the words out to figure out the person in question. The celebrities were not allowed to use anything that might give away the answer or to give a clue that would lead to the proper name of the person. They also could not say the clue to the contestant, with the penalty being loss of control for any violation. Each correct guess won a point, with three points winning the game. For example: * Clue #1: The part of the car that contains fuel is the gas... (Tank) * Clue #2: The automobile is more commonly called a... (Car) * Clue #3: George Washington is on the one- dollar... (Bill) * Tank + Car + Bill = Tinkerbell Or: * Clue #1: A person who can't hear is... (Deaf) * Clue #2: The fifth letter of the alphabet is... (E) * Clue #3: When you park your boat, you tie it to the ... (Dock) * Deaf + E + Dock = Daffy Duck Proper names could not be used as clues, such as \\"Our president who was married to Jackie Onassis was named John F...\\" for \\"Kennedy\\". Clue-givers were also not allowed to describe a word that is spelled like part of the name. The winning contestant played the Bonus Board for a chance at $300. A famous name (sent in by a home viewer) was given to the celebrity, who tried to convey the name to the contestant by way of clues. Guessing the word on the first clue won $300. Each additional clue reduced the value by $100. The celebrity could help on all three clues. If the contestant won the front game 3‚Äì0, winning the Bonus Board on the first clue awarded the $300 plus a new car, usually a Pontiac. In this situation, the celebrity was not allowed to help on the first clue. Home viewers whose Bonus Board clue led to a car win also won a special prize. At one point this was 100,000 Top Value trading stamps, then one million stamps. Players on the daytime version stayed until losing twice or winning seven times (NBC's limit at the time). On the primetime version, two new players competed for the entire show with a trip awarded to whoever won the most cash. =ABC= When the show returned in 1975, it also returned with a new format influenced largely by the success of CBS's Match Game. The two teams were replaced by two individual players competing with the assistance of four celebrities on a panel. The celebrities once again tried to convey the identity of a famous person or place to the contestants. One celebrity gave a clue to the controlling contestant, who had five seconds to guess who it was with a correct word guess. If it wasn't guessed, the next celebrity in line gave a clue to the next contestant. This continued until one player guessed the word, with a maximum of four clues. A correct guess on the first clue was worth $200, and decreased in $50 increments for each clue needed afterward. $500 won the game and a chance to win $10,000 more at the Bonus Board. At the Bonus Board, the contestant had to give a maximum of six (originally five) clues to four famous names or places to the celebrities. If a celebrity guessed one name correctly, the contestant won $500, which doubled to $1,000 if two names were guessed correctly, and then $2,000 if three names were guessed correctly. If all four names were guessed correctly, the contestant won $5,000. However, in the event that each of the celebrities guessed the name after only one clue (four clues in total), the contestant won $10,000. Players competed until either losing twice or exceeding ABC's winnings limit of $20,000 (but were allowed to keep winnings of up to $25,000). =Syndicated= Peck's version was played very similar to the ABC version, but with a few changes to accommodate the syndicated series (since the then-standard process of \\"bicycling\\" tapes shuffled the airings from city to city and made returning champions impractical). Two contestants played on Monday and Tuesday of a particular week, while two more played on Wednesday and Thursday. In a tournament fashion, the highest scorers from those games played each other on Friday. Instead of cash being awarded on a scale for each correct answer, every answer scored only one point, regardless of the number of clues necessary, with five winning the game. Correct answers were worth $100 on the Monday‚ÄìThursday shows and $200 on Fridays, but these payouts were not reflected in the scoring. If the game ended in a tie due to time running out, the player who needed fewer clues during the course of the game was declared the winner. The Bonus Board was played exactly the same as the ABC run for $5,000 in cash on Monday‚ÄìThursday shows. The Friday game, which was harder than the rest of the week, was played for $10,000 in prizes. This time, the player was allowed a maximum of five clues. Broadcast history =KTLA (1962‚Äì1963)= You Don't Say! began as a local series on Los Angeles station KTLA in November 1962 with Jack Barry, still in exile from the networks in the wake of the 1950s quiz show scandals, as host. =NBC (1963‚Äì1969)= You Don't Say! moved to NBC's afternoon lineup on April 1, 1963 at 3:30 PM Eastern (2:30 Central) with Tom Kennedy replacing Barry as host. For most of its run, the show placed a solid second against the popular CBS soap The Edge of Night and numerous weak ABC soap operas. A nighttime version in 1964 was not as successful, running from January 7 to May 12. On July 15, 1968, One Life to Live debuted on ABC at 3:30/2:30 and was a ratings success. In what may have been the largest housecleaning of its daytime schedule ever, NBC dropped You Don't Say! and three other games (Personality, Eye Guess, and The Match Game) on September 26, 1969. Replacing You Don't Say! on the lineup was the serial Bright Promise, which ran until 1972. =KTLA (1975)= The 1975 revival was also given a trial run on KTLA, airing on Sunday nights from April to June 1975. Originally hosted by local radio personality Clark Race with Kennedy as a regular panelist, these roles were reversed later in the show's brief run. =ABC (1975)= With CBS' revival of Match Game bringing celebrity games back into popularity, Andrews managed to interest ABC in a similar revival of You Don't Say! Kennedy was called upon to reassume his role as the show's host, doing so ten days after ending a three-year stint on ABC's Split Second; the show entered ABC's schedule on July 7 at 4:00 PM (3:00 Central), replacing The Money Maze. However, many affiliates either tape- delayed the network feed until the next morning or preempted the 4:00/3:00 slot entirely, garnering low ratings for the revival despite facing NBC's soap opera Somerset and two low-rated CBS games, Musical Chairs and Give-n-Take. Meanwhile, CBS' The Edge of Night had been its lowest-rated soap opera since a move in 1972 to 2:30/1:30. With As the World Turns set to expand to a full hour, the network decided to oust the 19-year-old show (which debuted on the same day in 1956 and packaged by the same company). In the first instance of a daytime serial moving to another network, Procter and Gamble Productions agreed to CBS' terms and moved The Edge of Night to ABC. ABC, desperate to get some affiliates back on board, banked on the show's instant familiarity and decided that the only viable slot for that show was 4:00/3:00. On November 28, You Don't Say! ended its five-month run, giving way to The Edge of Night the next Monday; as a result, a special Christmas week of shows with children playing, which Tom had plugged on-air during the last few weeks and would have continued the tradition from the NBC era, was never seen. According to an ABC press release dated November 6, 1975, You Don't Say! was slated to return to ABC's daytime schedule at a later time, but for unknown reasons, this never occurred. =Syndicated (1978‚Äì1979)= You Don't Say! returned on September 18, 1978 as a daily syndicated series, with Viacom Enterprises serving as the co-producer. However, due to Tom Kennedy hosting Name That Tune, the hosting reins were taken instead by Jim Peck. This version did not sell to many markets, and those who ran it tended to do so in non-peak slots (save for WPIX in New York, which aired it at 8:30 PM as part of a primetime syndicated game show block with the premiering Tic Tac Dough and reruns of the syndicated editions of Let's Make a Deal and To Tell the Truth, as did KHJ-TV in Los Angeles). With little to no promotion, the show ended its run completely before even making it through the first half of 1979. Before any episodes of this final incarnation of You Don‚Äôt Say went on the air, the contestants received letters indicating that Ralph Andrews had filed for bankruptcy protection and that their monetary winnings would not be coming in the mail as promised. Prizes supplied by corporations in exchange for on-air promotion were distributed, but no money was on the way. People who won trips could have availed themselves of the accommodations that were provided by hoteliers, but the airfare which was supposed to be paid for by the producer wasn‚Äôt provided because he didn‚Äôt have it. Those episodes were actually rerun, so ‚Äúwinning‚Äù contestants got to watch themselves win but lose a second time around. Music Composer Rex Koury was the musical director for the 1960s version, leading a small combo in the studio consisting of organ, xylophone and harp. Koury would play appropriate music after each name was guessed, or a generic \\"win cue\\" when a game was won. Stan Worth composed the theme for the 1970s versions, called \\"Downwind\\".
