At about long, it is Britain's smallest resident dragonfly. It is a very active late summer insect typical of heathland and moorland bog pools. Members of the genus Sympetrum are known as darters in the UK and as meadowhawks in the US and Canada. Identification Both sexes have black legs and pterostigmata and a very broad base to the hind wing. The thorax has yellow sides separated by a bold black panel in which are three yellow spots, resembling a highland darter (Sympetrum nigrescens). The male has a mainly black thorax and abdomen. The abdomen has small yellow marks on the side, that darken with age. The wings are clear. The female has black legs and brown eyes. The abdomen is mainly yellow, becoming browner with age. It has small yellow patches at the wing bases. Breeding This darter is restricted to acidic shallow pools, lake margins and ditches in lowland heath and moorland bogs, usually with bog-mosses and rushes. Eggs are laid in flight by dipping the tip of the abdomen into the water. The eggs hatch the following spring and the larvae develop very rapidly, emerging after as little as two months. Behaviour Males basking in the sun Males frequently bask in the sun, on open ground. The flight action is rather skittish resembling the ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum). Males are not territorial, but actively seek out females. This species is the smallest of Britain‚Äôs dragonflies. Although not as colourful as some other dragonflies it is a lovely dragonfly to watch. They often perch on a sunny spot on the ground. Their flight is a little skittish, and often flies away as you approach, but sometimes it is in a 'friendly mood' and lets you get very close. Sometimes they may even land on an observer‚Äôs hand. Population and conservation In the British Isles, this dragonfly is very locally distributed in the lowlands, but more widespread in the north-west and Ireland. It is often very locally abundant and maybe this triggers dispersal. Records from the south coast suggest that immigration from the continent does occur. Its main threats, however, are development, drainage, agriculture, and peat extraction.

It is the main shopping area in Runcorn with over 125,000 visitors per week. It was the largest enclosed shopping centre in Europe at the time of its construction and remains the largest in Cheshire. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1972. History =Construction and early years= Plaque marking the official opening of Runcorn Shopping City by HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1972 Designed by Fred Roche CBE, the Chief Architect and Planning Officer of the New Town, Runcorn Shopping City was built on a greenfield site near Halton Village. Roche is best known for his later, seminal role in the creation of Milton Keynes. The centre was to be the centrepiece of Runcorn New Town. The New Town's master planner, Arthur Ling, envisaged that it would become the \\"natural meeting place for the town's social and cultural life as well as for shopping, offices and specialised amenities such as theatre, library, central sports hall etc.\\" Influenced by the fully enclosed, drive-in shopping malls that had begun to emerge in North America in the 1960s, the Shopping City was to house other amenities such as a cinema, post office, library and pub. It was also close to the law courts, the police station and the hospital. The shopping complex itself was to be linked by pedestrian bridges and footpaths to some of the new, modern estates of the New Town, such as the radical but ill-fated Southgate Estate. Construction began in 1968 by John Laing Group commissioned by Grosvenor Estate Commercial Developments Limited and the Runcorn Development Corporation. The build cost ¬£10 million and was privately financed by Grosvenor. The centre was completed by 1971 and Runcorn Shopping City was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 5 May 1972. The building is raised on columns, partly to tackle the valley like topography, but also to allow the segregation of cars, buses and pedestrians. Vehicles arrive at ground level, giving access to the multi-storey car parks on each corner for visitors and to the shop basements for deliveries. Buses arrive on the dedicated raised busways which circle the town in a figure of 8 with the Shopping City at the centre. Pedestrians access the centre at the shopping level by using the four raised walkways, also at each corner of the centre, thus never having to cross a busy road and linking the centre to surrounding developments. The Shopping City and all of its surrounding ancillary buildings were encased in brilliant white tiles which were chosen to be self-cleansing; their crisp whiteness contrasting with the hill to the north and the trees and dense planting which would come to surround it. On its opening, The Times commented that, 'Shopping City is possibly the nearest planners have come to the sort of building imagined by science fiction writers. In appearance, it resembles a supersonic mosque, with gleaming white bricks even on the dullest day'. It also noted the 'clarity of the design of shops, malls and public squares' and the 'spacious, beautifully lighted shops'. The interior was finished to a very high standard, with white terrazzo floor tiles used throughout and Sicilian marble lining the walls, columns and shop fronts. The shops are laid out along malls in an H formation, with the 'Town Square' in the centre. There is a second storey around the square intended for restaurants and bars. At the time of its opening it was the largest fully enclosed shopping centre in Europe. Served by excellent transport links, not just within Runcorn itself (including the town's innovative busway system), but also with surrounding towns and cities, it quickly established itself as a premier shopping destination. By the early 1980s all the units were fully let and new town residents recall the four multi-storey car parks - 2,200 spaces - as being almost full in the early days. =Neglect and decline= Town Square inside Runcorn Shopping City in August 1989 The centre's early success at attracting huge numbers of shoppers, brought in by Runcorn's unique transportation system and its central location between Manchester and Liverpool, did not last as the owners at that time, Grosvenor, pushed rents up in an attempt to capitalise on the centre's popularity. Spiralling rents soon saw many of the big names close and move to centres with lower rents. The centre was bought by Fordgate Midland Properties Limited in January 1989 but a dispute arose about the property's condition at the time of sale. The previous owners, Grosvenor, had contracted with Laing to encapsulate asbestos in the roof voids and decontaminate those areas in 1988. This became the source of legal disputes between the three parties since Fordgate alleged that Grosvenor had, in the words of Lord Justice Saville, \\"fraudulently or negligently misrepresented the true condition of the premises so that the Appellants were induced to purchase the premises, believing them to contain treated and encapsulated asbestos when, in fact, the roof voids were dreadfully...contaminated with loose asbestos fibre\\". Fordgate undertook significant works to remove asbestos, replace and lower the original suspended ceiling, block up sky lights and replace damaged floor tiles and expansion joints, culminating with a rebranding in 1995 to Halton Lea Shopping Centre. In 1999, Fordgate used vacant land to the south of the centre, which had originally been intended for leisure and cultural use, to create a outdoor shopping park named Trident Retail Park, including a 9-screen cinema complex. In 1989, expansion land which had been set aside to the west of the centre was used to open a Asda superstore, later extended to and joined by a McDonald's restaurant. Halton Lea was taken into receivership in September 2009 which was managed by Savills, though the centre continued to operate as normal. In September 2010, the centre was put up for sale and on 24 March 2011 it was announced that the centre had been sold to F&C; Reit (since rebranded BMO Real Estate Partners) for approximately ¬£29.1 million using an offshore company, Runcorn One Ltd, registered in Guernsey. However, Fordgate retained ownership of one of the four multi-storey car parks and, in August 2011, attained planning permission to build a 148,348 sq ft superstore adjoining the shopping centre in place of the multi-storey car park, East Lane House and a Territorial Army Centre. Fordgate had said they would pay for a replacement TA Centre elsewhere in the town and the plan was approved by Halton Borough Council, despite objections from the new owners of the Shopping City. The scheme did not go ahead and by November 2014 the fourth car park was also under the ownership of BMO.The company which holds the fourth car park is called Meadow Walk Limited and is registered to the same Guernsey PO Box as Runcorn One Ltd Trident Retail Park was also sold separately from the enclosed shopping centre and in April 2014 was acquired by KWE. =Investment and renewal= Exterior of one of the four multi-storey car parks at Runcorn Shopping City after renovation In summer 2012, plans were announced for the renovation of the exterior of the building and three of the four multi-storey car parks to the designs of architects Leach Rhodes Walker of Manchester. The total sum invested by BMO exceeded ¬£3 million. The exterior had not been modified significantly since the building's original construction in the 1970s, and in 2010, a net was fitted around the building to stop detaching tiles from falling. In October 2013, following the renovation, the centre was re-branded to Runcorn Shopping Centre. Also in 2013, the surrounding area saw new investment by developer Opus Land North with the construction of a new Lidl, Burger King, garages and a car dealership on the site of the former Vestric House. A setback occurred in April 2015 when Tesco, one of the centre's anchor tenants, announced it was closing several stores across the UK, including its Runcorn store. Tesco had operated a large supermarket in the shopping centre since the 1970s. The floor-space had been reduced in the early 2000s and the store rebranded as a Tesco Metro. The large Tesco unit was not long vacant when The Range announced in August the same year that they were to open a new store in the same units. Despite its many name changes, most Runcorn residents had continued to call it Runcorn Shopping City and in July 2017 the centre reverted to its original name. Its new logo, inspired by original signage, was created by John Saunders in 2017. In August 2017, as part of a demerger, the centre was transferred to Capreon before entering administration in 2019. Shops and services Directory map of Runcorn Shopping City Runcorn Shopping City comprises over 60 stores. Originally anchored by Littlewoods and Woolworths, as of 2020 the main anchor store is The Range. The centre also hosts many smaller retailers and has introduced an incubator for local start up outlets in 'The Box'. The centre is also complemented by surrounding developments, including large supermarkets, drive through fast food restaurants, and the adjacent Trident Retail Park and its multiplex cinema. Local amenities like the main library and Council 'Direct Link' centres are also attached to the Shopping City in the civic quarter. Future development In April 2018, Halton Borough Council unveiled concept plans for the regeneration of the area surrounding and adjoining the Shopping City under the theme, 'Halton Healthy New Town'. The centrepiece of this plan had been the reconstruction of the neighbouring Halton General Hospital site but funding from central government programmes was denied and the wider regeneration plans stalled. Following the centre entering receivership in 2019, Savills appointed RivingtonHark to work with Halton Borough Council and asset management company ICG Longbow to develop the site into a 'mixed use retail, lifestyle and wellness centre.' Location and transport The Shopping City was built as a central focus for the New Town centre, and a civic quarter was built adjoining the centre which includes a library, police station and local government offices. Halton General Hospital is also nearby. The centre is also complemented by surrounding developments, including large supermarkets, drive through fast food restaurants, and the adjacent Trident Retail Park and its multiplex cinema. The Old Town area of Runcorn with its Brindley Theatre is a few minutes drive away and the shopping centre is overlooked by the historic Halton Castle. It has a core catchment population of 120,000. =Bus= Elevated busway at Runcorn Shopping City Runcorn Shopping City is serviced by two bus stations which provide both local and regional services across Runcorn, Widnes, Warrington, Huyton, Chester and Liverpool. Both stations are integrated with the Shopping City with indoor waiting areas. Shopping City is the main bus interchange for the town and its unique system of dedicated busways. =Road= The Shopping City sits alongside the A533, the main route north to Widnes and Liverpool across the Mersey Gateway Bridge. To the south is the nearby M56 motorway to Manchester, Chester and North Wales. Warrington, Northwich and Frodsham are a short drive away. The centre has four multi-storey car parks containing 2,200 spaces. Car parking is free and each car park features disabled and infant & parent spots close to the entrances on the shopping level. =Rail= Two major railway stations are nearby, both of which are a short commute away. Runcorn provides services north to Liverpool Lime Street and south to Birmingham New Street and London Euston. Runcorn East connects Manchester Piccadilly, Warrington Bank Quay, Frodsham, Helsby, Chester and North Wales.

She was born the younger of two children in Rixdorf in 1903. Her father was an unskilled labourer and her mother a homeworker in Berlin. After attending primary and middle school, she worked as an office worker and a shorthand typist. In 1919, she joined the Free Socialist Youth movement, and in 1921, the Communist Party of Germany. She worked for the Party's central committee and in 1922-23, was a shorthand typist with the Communist Youth International (KJI) in Moscow. K√ºhn was thereafter a member of the central committee of the KPD and the KPD Reichstag group. In 1926-27 she was archivist with the KJI and then until 1931, secretary and shorthand typist at the Soviet Union's bureau of commerce in Berlin. In 1931, she emigrated to Moscow with her first husband, Erich Wendt. She became an instructor with the Comintern and completed a distance learning study at the Academy of Marxism-Leninism and an evening course at Moscow State University. Following the arrest of her husband in 1936 during the Stalinist purges, she divorced him the same year and was herself investigated. She remained under an official Party reprimand until 1938. From 1939 to 1941, she worked as a compositor at a foreign language printer, and later for the Comintern until 1945. Walter and Lotte Ulbricht at the Leipzig Trade Fair, 1964 K√ºhn's older brother, Bruno, was discovered by the Gestapo in Amsterdam in 1943, working as a radio operator for the NKVD. He was executed in 1944, probably in Brussels. Until 1947, she was a member of the central committee of the Communist Party. After 1947, she was a personal assistant to Walter Ulbricht, whom she knew from their time in Moscow, where they lived at the Hotel Lux, along with numerous other German exiles. After her 1953 marriage to Ulbricht, she resigned her job working for him and began studying at the Institute for Social Sciences, which awarded her a Social Sciences Diploma in 1959. During 1959-73, she was employed by the Institute for Marxism-Leninism, where, among other things, she was responsible for editing Walter Ulbricht's speeches and writings published by the Institute. In addition, she was a member of the Women's Commission of the Secretariat of the Central Committee and of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. She retired in July 1973, a few weeks before the death of her husband. Lotte Ulbricht was much feted by the state and party leadership of East Germany, including in 1959, 1963, and 1978 the Fatherland Order of Merit, in 1969 and 1983 the Order of Karl Marx, and in 1988 the Grand Star of Friendship of Nations. In a rare interview, after German reunification, in 1990, she complained that \\"Honecker wasted my husband's inheritance\\".\\"Honecker hat das Erbe meines Mannes verspielt\\" On March 27, 2002, she struggled out of her wheelchair and shuffled to a ladder propped against a bookcase. She climbed to look for a book on an upper shelf, crashed to the floor, and died that night. She lived at 12 Majakowskiring Street, Pankow, Berlin. She and Walter adopted a Russian girl, Beate Ulbricht (1944-1991).

It can be found in reefs of the Indo- west Pacific region: from the Persian Gulf and Maldives to Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia. It usually swims at depths of between 3 and 15 m. [2008]: Chaetodon collare. Retrieved 2008-SEP-01. It can grow to 18 cm (over 7 in) in length. The red-tailed butterflyfish is brown to black, with lighter scales giving it a spotted appearance. It has a prominent, vertical white streak behind the eyes, a dark stripe over the eyes, and another, smaller white stripe in front of the eyes. The base of the tail is bright red, followed by a black stripe. The tip of the tail is diffuse white. In the wild, its diet consists of coral polyps. In captivity, it is a carnivore, taking fish meat and shrimp. Systematics The mailed butterflyfish (C. reticulatus) - a case of convergent evolution? It belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, its relationships are doubtful; it seems related to the \\"raccoon- masked\\" group including the black butterflyfish (C. flavirostris), diagonal butterflyfish (C. fasciatus), Philippine butterflyfish (C. adiergastos) and the raccoon butterflyfish (C. lunula). Its color and pattern is entirely different from these, but it shares the robust habitus and bold habits.

PDF fulltext The mailed butterflyfish (C. reticulatus) is a near-match of C. collare in appearance, save for a less brown hue and light blue instead of red in its black-based tail. These two are widely sympatric in the western Pacific. But DNA sequence and osteology data overwhelmingly agree that C. reticulatus belongs to the subgenus called \\"Citharoedus\\" (a name preoccupied by a mollusc genus). This contains fish like the scrawled butterflyfish (C. meyeri), similar in shape and size but with a \\"finger-painted\\" pattern of a few prominent and uneven lines on light silvery background. (1988): Osteology and Phylogeny of the Chaetodontidae (Pisces: Perciformes). University of Hawaii, Honolulu. If Rabdophorus were to be considered a distinct genus, \\"Citharoedus\\" would not be included in it but placed with the subgenera Lepidochaetodon or Megaprotodon. Thus, the red-tailed and mailed butterflyfishes probably represent a case of convergent evolution and perhaps mimicry. What selection forces were responsible for the striking similarity between two rather unrelated Chaetodon is not known. The highly anomalous 12S rRNA mtDNA sequence found in this species in one 2007 study seems to be due to a laboratory error; in another study a 12S rRNA sequence agreeing with the general pattern of mtDNA evolution in Rabdophorus was found.

The gameplay is mission based and involves elements of strategy and planning. The player can order wingmen to fly in formation and attack specific targets. RISC OS =Acorn Archimedes= Star Fighter 3000 was first released for the Acorn Archimedes, in November 1994, by Fednet Software. Fednet Software was a company created by Tim Parry and Andrew Hutchings to publish the game. Earlier games the pair developed were Chocks Away and Stunt Racer 2000, which were published by The Fourth Dimension. Version 3.20, of this branch of the game, was released in January 2016. Later versions improve compatibility across RISC OS machines and are free to any owner of a previous release. =Microdigital Omega= In 2002, a second branch for RISC OS was developed for newer machines. It was a back-port of the 3DO code. Development was done under the software label FlaYmz; headed by Nathan Atkinson (formerly of Visions of the Impossible) and coded by Lee Noar. Paul Thomson (VOTI and DFI) and Lee Johnston (VOTI) worked on the new introduction. The conversion was extremely difficult because little paperwork was available to explain how the 3DO handled some of the graphics routines. Lee Noar had the difficult task unpicking this code. This version featured the graphical and gameplay enhancements of the 3DO version. FlaYmz worked with MicroDigital to produce a killer game for release of the Omega computer, showing off the power of a dedicated graphics card in a RISC OS computer. The port was developed on StrongARM RISC PCs which, for most of the development, were too slow to run the game at a decent fps. However, the deal fell through when MicroDigital started showing financial difficulties. Optimisations were done to the code to make it playable on the StrongARM. Later, in April 2008, this version was made available for through RiscWorld magazine, the full version being bundled free with Volume 8, Issue 6.http://www.apdl.org.uk/riscworld/volumes/volume8/issue6/sf3k/index.htm FlaYmz had no involvement in the release in 2008, having disbanded shortly after Microdigital failed due to the market decline. 3DO The 3DO version was developed by Tim Parry and Andrew Hutchings. It was developed after the original Acorn version was released. This version is slightly different from the original RISC OS game. The map screen is in 3D, not 2D as in the Acorn RISC OS version. Also, to upgrade the ship the player must collect a series of 3D shapes after blowing up certain objects. In the Acorn RISC OS version, the player collects and spends money on ship upgrades.

These versions were ports of the 3DO version. Unlike the original Acorn version and 3DO version, Tim Parry and Andrew Hutchings had no involvement in their development. These versions make heavy use of distance fog to significantly decrease the draw distance. Detail levels on the buildings, texture mapped ground, and other objects were also decreased. Reception Reviews for the 3DO version varied widely. Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized the controls for being too loose but praised the huge number of missions, the addictive gameplay, and most of all the ability to fly freely in any direction. GamePro summarized that \\"Star Fighter doesn't quite soar with the eagles, but it doesn't flop with the turkeys, either.\\" They noted the ability to fly in any direction and the large number of missions as positive elements, and the slow game speed, undetailed graphics, and pronounced pop up as negative elements. A reviewer for Next Generation also found the game uneven and cited the large number of missions, slow game speed, and \\"ridiculous\\" pop up. However, he additionally commented that the ability to deform the landscape with weapons fire is fun, and that \\"enemy installations tend to be designed as if someone were really trying to defend themselves\\". Maximum panned it for its \\"dreadful control system\\", pronounced slowdown, and grating music, as well as the simplicity of the early missions. They did praise the game's visuals, but concluded that \\"when inevitably compared to Air Combat, this ultimately fails to present a credible alternative.\\" Reviewing the Saturn version, Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine said that while the game is technically proficient, the controls are oversensitive, the graphics blocky, and the action so lacking in variety that it soon becomes predictable and dull. He added, \\"As a shoot 'em up it lacks pace and easy accessibility to make it great, and as a flight sim it lacks depth. As a result, Starfighter 3000 floats about tepidly in between.\\" Next Generations brief reviews of the Saturn and PlayStation versions opined that they were not bad, but somewhat lackluster. Stephen Poole of GameSpot gave the PC version a 4.4 out of 10, saying that flight simulators are much better suited for PC than console, and as a straight conversion of a 3DO game, Star Fighter retains the shortcomings of its console origins. He especially criticised the poor graphics, story and controls.

History There has been a castle at Glenarm since the 13th century, where it resides at the heart of one of Northern Ireland's oldest estates. It was owned by John Bisset who acquired lands between Larne and Ballycastle from Hugh de Lacy, the Earl of Ulster. Bisset made Glenarm his capital, and by 1260 there was a castle, which stood at the centre of the present village, with a kitchen garden, an orchard and a mill, as well as woods and meadows. The old village courthouse still incorporates some of its walls, indeed an immured skeleton was discovered there in the 1970s. In 1495 Con O'Donnell of Tirconnell marched on ‚ÄòMacEoin of the Glens‚Äô (as the Bisset chieftain was called), ‚Äòfor he had been told that MacEoin had the finest wife, steed and hound in his neighbourhood. O'Donnell had sent messengers for the steed but was refused it so he made no delay, but surmounting the difficulties of every passage he arrived at night at MacEoin's house without giving any warning of his designs. He captured MacEoin and made himself master of his wife his steed and his hound'. The last MacEoin Bisset was killed fighting the O'Donnells in 1522. Their lands were then seized by the MacDonnells, their former partners, who occupied the Bisset's castle until they built the new one. The present castle was built by Sir Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim, in 1636, and it has remained in the family since its construction. It is currently owned by Randal, Viscount Dunluce, the son of Alexander McDonnell, 9th Earl of Antrim. The McDonnells have been in Glenarm for nearly 600 years and the Estate has been in the family for 400 years. Events The Castle's Walled Garden is open to the public between May and September and hosts many events. In July of every year the grounds are the site of a world-class Highland Games. The Dalriada Festival is also held at Glenarm Castle and within the local village, which celebrates sport, music and fine food from all over Scotland and Ireland. The castle also hosts traditional Ulster Scots cultural events. As part of the Dalriada Festival, Glenarm Castle has started to host large outdoor concerts. As of 2012, it has welcomed artists like General Fiasco, The Priests, Duke Special, Ronan Keating, Sharon Corr, Brian Houston, David Phelps and the likes. Summer Madness, Ireland's biggest Christian Festival, moved from its annual residence at the Kings Hall, Belfast, to Glenarm Castle in 2012. It is thought this festival will return to Glenarm on a yearly basis for the foreseeable future. Film Location Glenarm Castle was used as a major location in Five Minutes of Heaven.

The linearization technique was introduced by Marion King Hubbert in his 1982 review paper. The Hubbert curve is the first derivative of a logistic function, which has been used for modeling the depletion of crude oil in particular, the depletion of finite mineral resources in general and also population growth patterns. Example of a Hubbert Linearization on the US Lower-48 crude oil production.  Principle  The first step of the Hubbert linearization consists of plotting the yearly production data (P in bbl/y) as a fraction of the cumulative production (Q in bbl) on the vertical axis and the cumulative production on the horizontal axis. This representation exploits the linear property of the logistic differential equation: : \\\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}=P(t)=k \\\\cdot Q(t) \\\\cdot \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{Q(t)}{URR}\\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(1)} \\\\\\\\! with *k as logistic growth rate and *URR as the ultimately recoverable resource. We can rewrite (1) as the following: : \\\\frac{P(t)}{Q(t)}=k \\\\cdot \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{Q(t)}{URR}\\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\, \\\\mbox{(2)} \\\\\\\\! The above relation is a line equation in the P/Q versus Q plane. Consequently, a linear regression on the data points gives us an estimate of the line slope calculated by -k/URR and intercept from which we can derive the Hubbert curve parameters: * The k parameter is the intercept of the vertical axis. * The URR value is the intercept of the horizontal axis.  Examples  = Global oil production = The geologist Kenneth S. Deffeyes applied this technique in 2005 to make a prediction about the peak of overall oil production at the end of the same year, which has since been found to be premature. He did not make a distinction between \\"conventional\\" and \\"non- conventional\\" oil produced by fracturing, aka tight oil, which has continued further growth in oil production. However, since 2005 conventional oil production has not grown anymore. = US oil production = The charts below gives an example of the application of the Hubbert Linearization technique in the case of the US Lower-48 oil production. The fit of a line using the data points from 1956 to 2005 (in green) gives a URR of 199 Gb and a logistic growth rate of 6%. Image:HubbertLin_US_Lower48.svgHubbert Linearization on US's oil production Image:Hubbert_US_Lower48.svgHubbert curve on US's oil production = Norway oil production = The Norwegian Hubbert linearization estimates an URR = 30 Gb and a logistic growth rate of k = 17%. Image:HubbertLin_Norway.svgHubbert Linearization on Norway's oil production Image:Hubbert_Norway.svgHubbert curve on Norway's oil production Alternative techniques =Second Hubbert linearization= The Hubbert linearization principle can be extended to the first derivatives of the production rate by computing the derivative of (2): : \\\\frac{dP(t)/dt}{P(t)}=k \\\\cdot \\\\left(1 - 2\\\\frac{Q(t)}{URR}\\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(3)} \\\\\\\\! The left term, the rate of change of production per current production, is often called the decline rate. The decline curve is a line that starts at +k, crosses zero at URR/2 and ends at -k. Thus, we can derive the Hubbert curve parameters: * The growth parameter k is the intercept of the vertical axis. * The URR value is twice the intercept of the horizontal axis. =Hubbert parabola= This representation was proposed by Roberto Canogar and applied to the oil depletion problem. It is equation (2) multiplied by Q. : P(t)=kQ(t)-\\\\frac{k}{URR}Q(t)^2 \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\; \\\\mbox{(4)} \\\\\\\\! The parabola starts from the origin (0,0) and passes through (URR,0). Data points until t are used by the least squares fitting method to find an estimate for URR. =Logit transform= David Rutledge applied the logit transform for the analysis of coal production data, which often has a worse signal-to-noise ratio than the production data for hydrocarbons. The integrative nature of cumulation serves as a low pass, filtering noise effects. The production data is fitted to the logistic curve after transformation using e(t) as normalized exhaustion parameter going from 0 to 1. : e(t) = Q(t)/URR \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\;\\\\; \\\\mbox{(5)} \\\\\\\\! : logit (e(t)) = -ln \\\\, \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{e(t)}-1 \\\\right) = -ln \\\\, \\\\left(\\\\frac{URR}{Q(t)}-1\\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(6)} \\\\\\\\!

Although it is often studied in the model organism E. coli, other bacteria show many similarities. Replication is bi-directional and originates at a single origin of replication (OriC). It consists of three steps: Initiation, elongation, and termination. Theta type replication. Most circular bacterial chromosomes are replicated bidirectionally, starting at one point of origin and replicating in two directions away from the origin. This results in semiconservative replication, in which each new identical DNA molecule contains one template strand from the original molecule, shown as the solid lines, and one new strand, shown as the dotted lines. Initiation All cells must finish DNA replication before they can proceed for cell division. Media conditions that support fast growth in bacteria also couples with shorter inter-initiation time in them, i.e. the doubling time in fast growing cells is less as compared to the slow growth. In other words, it is possible that in fast growth conditions the grandmother cells starts replicating its DNA for grand daughter cell. For the same reason, the initiation of DNA replication is highly regulated. Bacterial origins regulate orisome assembly, a nuclei-protein complex assembled on the origin responsible for unwinding the origin and loading all the replication machinery. In E. coli, the direction for orisome assembly are built into a short stretch of nucleotide sequence called as origin of replication (oriC) which contains multiple binding sites for the initiator protein DnaA (a highly homologous protein amongst bacterial kingdom). DnaA has four domains with each domain responsible for a specific task. There are 11 DnaA binding sites/boxes on the E. coli origin of replication out of which three boxes R1, R2 and R4 (which have a highly conserved 9 bp consensus sequence 5' - TTATC/ACACA ) are high affinity DnaA boxes. They bind to DnaA-ADP and DnaA-ATP with equal affinities and are bound by DnaA throughout most of the cell cycle and forms a scaffold on which rest of the orisome assembles. The rest eight DnaA boxes are low affinity sites that preferentially bind to DnaA-ATP. During initiation, DnaA bound to high affinity DnaA box R4 donates additional DnaA to the adjacent low affinity site and progressively fill all the low affinity DnaA boxes. Filling of the sites changes origin conformation from its native state. It is hypothesized that DNA stretching by DnaA bound to the origin promotes strand separation which allows more DnaA to bind to the unwound region. The DnaC helicase loader then interacts with the DnaA bound to the single-stranded DNA to recruit the DnaB helicase, which will continue to unwind the DNA as the DnaG primase lays down an RNA primer and DNA Polymerase III holoenzyme begins elongation. = Regulation = Chromosome replication in bacteria is regulated at the initiation stage. DnaA-ATP is hydrolyzed into the inactive DnaA-ADP by RIDA (Regulatory Inactivation of DnaA), and converted back to the active DnaA-ATP form by DARS (DnaA Reactivating Sequence, which is itself regulated by Fis and IHF). However, the main source of DnaA-ATP is synthesis of new molecules. Meanwhile, several other proteins interact directly with the oriC sequence to regulate initiation, usually by inhibition. In E. coli these proteins include DiaA, SeqA, IciA, HU, and ArcA-P, but they vary across other bacterial species. A few other mechanisms in E. coli that variously regulate initiation are DDAH (datA-Dependent DnaA Hydrolysis, which is also regulated by IHF), inhibition of the dnaA gene (by the SeqA protein), and reactivation of DnaA by the lipid membrane. Elongation E coli replisome with a loop in lagging strand DNA Once priming is complete, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is loaded into the DNA and replication begins. The catalytic mechanism of DNA polymerase III involves the use of two metal ions in the active site, and a region in the active site that can discriminate between deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The metal ions are general divalent cations that help the 3' OH initiate a nucleophilic attack onto the alpha phosphate of the deoxyribonucleotide and orient and stabilize the negatively charged triphosphate on the deoxyribonucleotide. Nucleophilic attack by the 3' OH on the alpha phosphate releases pyrophosphate, which is then subsequently hydrolyzed (by inorganic phosphatase) into two phosphates. This hydrolysis drives DNA synthesis to completion. Furthermore, DNA polymerase III must be able to distinguish between correctly paired bases and incorrectly paired bases. This is accomplished by distinguishing Watson-Crick base pairs through the use of an active site pocket that is complementary in shape to the structure of correctly paired nucleotides. This pocket has a tyrosine residue that is able to form van der Waals interactions with the correctly paired nucleotide. In addition, dsDNA (double stranded DNA) in the active site has a wider major groove and shallower minor groove that permits the formation of hydrogen bonds with the third nitrogen of purine bases and the second oxygen of pyrimidine bases. Finally, the active site makes extensive hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone. These interactions result in the DNA polymerase III closing around a correctly paired base. If a base is inserted and incorrectly paired, these interactions could not occur due to disruptions in hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. DNA is read in the 3' ‚Üí 5' direction, therefore, nucleotides are synthesized (or attached to the template strand) in the 5' ‚Üí 3' direction. However, one of the parent strands of DNA is 3' ‚Üí 5' while the other is 5' ‚Üí 3'. To solve this, replication occurs in opposite directions. Heading towards the replication fork, the leading strand is synthesized in a continuous fashion, only requiring one primer. On the other hand, the lagging strand, heading away from the replication fork, is synthesized in a series of short fragments known as Okazaki fragments, consequently requiring many primers. The RNA primers of Okazaki fragments are subsequently degraded by RNase H and DNA Polymerase I (exonuclease), and the gaps (or nicks) are filled with deoxyribonucleotides and sealed by the enzyme ligase. =Rate of replication= The rate of DNA replication in a living cell was first measured as the rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected E. coli. During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37 ¬∞C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second. The mutation rate per base pair per replication during phage T4 DNA synthesis is 1.7 per 108.Drake JW (1970) The Molecular Basis of Mutation. Holden-Day, San Francisco .  Termination  Termination of DNA replication in E. coli is completed through the use of termination sequences and the Tus protein. These sequences allow the two replication forks to pass through in only one direction, but not the other. DNA replication initially produces two catenated or linked circular DNA duplexes, each comprising one parental strand and one newly synthesised strand (by nature of semiconservative replication). This catenation can be visualised as two interlinked rings which cannot be separated. Topoisomerase 2 in E. coli unlinks or decatenates the two circular DNA duplexes by breaking the phosphodiester bonds present in two successive nucleotides of either parent DNA or newly formed DNA and thereafter the ligating activity ligates that broken DNA strand and so the two DNA get formed. Other Prokaryotic replication models The theta type replication has been already mentioned. There are other types of prokaryotic replication such as rolling circle replication and D-loop replication =Rolling Circle Replication= This is seen in bacterial conjugation where the same circulartemplate DNA rotates and around it the new strand develops. Rolling circle replication. When conjugation is initiated by a signal the relaxase enzyme creates a nick in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the oriT. Relaxase may work alone or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a relaxosome. In the F-plasmid system the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI, TraY, TraM and the integrated host factor IHF. The nicked strand, or T-strand, is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5'-terminus to 3'-terminus direction. The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action (vegetative replication beginning at the oriV) or in concert with conjugation (conjugative replication similar to the rolling circle replication of lambda phage). Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur. A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event. =D-loop replication= D-loop replication is mostly seen in organellar DNA, Where a triple stranded structure called displacement loop is formed.

The colloquial term \\"too big to fail\\" was popularized by U.S. Congressman Stewart McKinney in a 1984 Congressional hearing, discussing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's intervention with Continental Illinois. The term had previously been used occasionally in the press and similar thinking had motivated earlier bank bailouts. The term emerged as prominent in public discourse following the 2007‚Äì08 global financial crisis.Turner, Adair. \\"Too Much 'Too Big to Fail'?\\" Economist's View. September 2, 2010. Critics see the policy as counterproductive and that large banks or other institutions should be left to fail if their risk management is not effective. Some critics, such as Alan Greenspan, believe that such large organisations should be deliberately broken up: \\"If they're too big to fail, they're too big\\". Some economists such as Paul Krugman hold that financial crises arise principally from banks being under-regulated rather than their size, using the widespread collapse of small banks in the Great Depression to illustrate this argument.Paul Krugman \\"Financial Reform 101\\" April 1, 2010Paul Krugman \\"Stop 'Stop Too Big To Fail'.\\" New York Times, April 21, 2010Paul Krugman \\"Too big to fail FAIL\\", New York Times, June 18, 2009Paul Krugman \\"A bit more on too big to fail and related\\", New York Times, June 19, 2009 In 2014, the International Monetary Fund and others said the problem still had not been dealt with. While the individual components of the new regulation for systemically important banks (additional capital requirements, enhanced supervision and resolution regimes) likely reduced the prevalence of TBTF, the fact that there is a definite list of systemically important banks considered TBTF has a partly offsetting impact. Definition Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke also defined the term in 2010: \\"A too-big-to-fail firm is one whose size, complexity, interconnectedness, and critical functions are such that, should the firm go unexpectedly into liquidation, the rest of the financial system and the economy would face severe adverse consequences.\\" He continued that: \\"Governments provide support to too-big-to-fail firms in a crisis not out of favoritism or particular concern for the management, owners, or creditors of the firm, but because they recognize that the consequences for the broader economy of allowing a disorderly failure greatly outweigh the costs of avoiding the failure in some way. Common means of avoiding failure include facilitating a merger, providing credit, or injecting government capital, all of which protect at least some creditors who otherwise would have suffered losses. ... If the crisis has a single lesson, it is that the too- big-to-fail problem must be solved.\\" Bernanke cited several risks with too- big-to-fail institutions: # These firms generate severe moral hazard: \\"If creditors believe that an institution will not be allowed to fail, they will not demand as much compensation for risks as they otherwise would, thus weakening market discipline; nor will they invest as many resources in monitoring the firm's risk-taking. As a result, too-big-to-fail firms will tend to take more risk than desirable, in the expectation that they will receive assistance if their bets go bad.\\" # It creates an uneven playing field between big and small firms. \\"This unfair competition, together with the incentive to grow that too-big-to-fail provides, increases risk and artificially raises the market share of too-big-to-fail firms, to the detriment of economic efficiency as well as financial stability.\\" # The firms themselves become major risks to overall financial stability, particularly in the absence of adequate resolution tools. Bernanke wrote: \\"The failure of Lehman Brothers and the near-failure of several other large, complex firms significantly worsened the crisis and the recession by disrupting financial markets, impeding credit flows, inducing sharp declines in asset prices, and hurting confidence. The failures of smaller, less interconnected firms, though certainly of significant concern, have not had substantial effects on the stability of the financial system as a whole.\\" Background on banking regulation =Depository banks= Prior to the Great Depression, U.S. consumer bank deposits were not guaranteed by the government, increasing the risk of a bank run, in which a large number of depositors withdraw their deposits at the same time. Since banks lend most of the deposits and only retain a fraction in the proverbial vault, a bank run can render the bank insolvent. During the Depression, hundreds of banks became insolvent and depositors lost their money. As a result, the U.S. enacted the 1933 Banking Act, sometimes called the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits up to a limit of $2,500, with successive increases to the current $250,000.FDIC Deposit Insurance Summary Retrieved November 17, 2013] In exchange for the deposit insurance provided by the federal government, depository banks are highly regulated and expected to invest excess customer deposits in lower-risk assets. =Investment banks and the shadow banking system= In contrast to depository banks, investment banks generally obtain funds from sophisticated investors and often make complex, risky investments with the funds, speculating either for their own account or on behalf of their investors. They also are \\"market makers\\" in that they serve as intermediaries between two investors that wish to take opposite sides of a financial transaction. The Glass-Steagall Act separated investment and depository banking until its repeal in 1999. Prior to 2008, the government did not explicitly guarantee the investor funds, so investment banks were not subject to the same regulations as depository banks and were allowed to take considerably more risk. Investment banks, along with other innovations in banking and finance referred to as the shadow banking system, grew to rival the depository system by 2007. They became subject to the equivalent of a bank run in 2007 and 2008, in which investors (rather than depositors) withdrew sources of financing from the shadow system. This run became known as the subprime mortgage crisis. During 2008, the five largest U.S. investment banks either failed (Lehman Brothers), were bought out by other banks at fire-sale prices (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) or were at risk of failure and obtained depository banking charters to obtain additional Federal Reserve support (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). In addition, the government provided bailout funds via the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008. Fed Chair Ben Bernanke described in November 2013 how the Panic of 1907 was essentially a run on the non-depository financial system, with many parallels to the crisis of 2008. One of the results of the Panic of 1907 was the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.Ben Bernanke-The Crisis as a Classic Financial Panic-November 2013 =Resolution authority= Before 1950, U.S. federal bank regulators had essentially two options for resolving an insolvent institution: 1) closure, with liquidation of assets and payouts for insured depositors; or 2) purchase and assumption, encouraging the acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities by another firm. A third option was made available by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950: providing assistance, the power to support an institution through loans or direct federal acquisition of assets, until it could recover from its distress. The statute limited the \\"assistance\\" option to cases where \\"continued operation of the bank is essential to provide adequate banking service\\". Regulators shunned this third option for many years, fearing that if regionally or nationally important banks were thought generally immune to liquidation, markets in their shares would be distorted. Thus, the assistance option was never employed during the period 1950‚Äì1969, and very seldom thereafter. Research into historical banking trends suggests that the consumption loss associated with National Banking Era bank runs was far more costly than the consumption loss from stock market crashes. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act was passed in 1991, giving the FDIC the responsibility to rescue an insolvent bank by the least costly method. The Act had the implicit goal of eliminating the widespread belief among depositors that a loss of depositors and bondholders will be prevented for large banks. However, the Act included an exception in cases of systemic risk, subject to the approval of two-thirds of the FDIC Board of Directors, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Treasury Secretary. Analysis =Bank size and concentration= Assets of largest U.S. banks per FY2012 Annual Reports Percentage of banking assets held by largest five U.S. banks, 1997‚Äì2011 Bank size, complexity, and interconnectedness with other banks may inhibit the ability of the government to resolve (wind-down) the bank without significant disruption to the financial system or economy, as occurred with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008. This risk of \\"too big to fail\\" entities increases the likelihood of a government bailout using taxpayer dollars. The largest U.S. banks continue to grow larger while the concentration of bank assets increases. The largest six U.S. banks had assets of $9,576 billion as of year-end 2012, per their 2012 annual reports (SEC Form 10K). For scale, this was 59% of the U.S. GDP for 2012 of $16,245 billion. The top 5 U.S. banks had approximately 30% of the U.S. banking assets in 1998; this rose to 45% by 2008 and to 48% by 2010, before falling to 47% in 2011. This concentration continued despite the subprime mortgage crisis and its aftermath. During March 2008, JP Morgan Chase acquired investment bank Bear Stearns. Bank of America acquired investment bank Merrill Lynch in September 2008. Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia in January 2009. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley obtained depository bank holding company charters, which gave them access to additional Federal Reserve credit lines. Bank deposits for all U.S. banks ranged between approximately 60‚Äì70% of GDP from 1960 to 2006, then jumped during the crisis to a peak of nearly 84% in 2009 before falling to 77% by 2011. The number of U.S. commercial and savings bank institutions reached a peak of 14,495 in 1984; this fell to 6,532 by the end of 2010. The ten largest U.S. banks held nearly 50% of U.S. deposits as of 2011. =Implicit guarantee subsidy= Since the full amount of the deposits and debts of \\"too big to fail\\" banks are effectively guaranteed by the government, large depositors and investors view investments with these banks as a safer investment than deposits with smaller banks. Therefore, large banks are able to pay lower interest rates to depositors and investors than small banks are obliged to pay. In October 2009, Sheila Bair, at that time the Chairperson of the FDIC, commented: A study conducted by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that the difference between the cost of funds for banks with more than $100 billion in assets and the cost of funds for smaller banks widened dramatically after the formalization of the \\"too big to fail\\" policy in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008. This shift in the large banks' cost of funds was in effect equivalent to an indirect \\"too big to fail\\" subsidy of $34 billion per year to the 18 U.S. banks with more than $100 billion in assets. The editors of Bloomberg View estimated there was an $83 billion annual subsidy to the 10 largest United States banks, reflecting a funding advantage of 0.8 percentage points due to implicit government support, meaning the profits of such banks are largely a taxpayer-backed illusion. Another study by Frederic Schweikhard and Zoe Tsesmelidakis estimated the amount saved by America's biggest banks from having a perceived safety net of a government bailout was $120 billion from 2007 to 2010.Brendan Greeley, \\"The Price of Too Big to Fail\\", BusinessWeek, 5 July 2012 For America's biggest banks the estimated savings was $53 billion for Citigroup, $32 billion for Bank of America, $10 billion for JPMorgan, $8 billion for Wells Fargo, and $4 billion for AIG. The study noted that passage of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act‚Äîwhich promised an end to bailouts‚Äîdid nothing to raise the price of credit (i.e., lower the implicit subsidy) for the \\"too-big-too-fail\\" institutions. One 2013 study (Acharya, Anginer, and Warburton) measured the funding cost advantage provided by implicit government support to large financial institutions. Credit spreads were lower by approximately 28 basis points (0.28%) on average over the 1990‚Äì2010 period, with a peak of more than 120 basis points in 2009. In 2010, the implicit subsidy was worth nearly $100 billion to the largest banks. The authors concluded: \\"Passage of Dodd‚ÄìFrank did not eliminate expectations of government support.\\" Economist Randall S. Kroszner summarized several approaches to evaluating the funding cost differential between large and small banks. The paper discusses methodology and does not specifically answer the question of whether larger institutions have an advantage. During November 2013, the Moody's credit rating agency reported that it would no longer assume the eight largest U.S. banks would receive government support in the event they faced bankruptcy. However, the GAO reported that politicians and regulators would still face significant pressure to bail out large banks and their creditors in the event of a financial crisis.Mark Whitehouse, \\"Moody's Thinks We've Solved Too Big to Fail\\", Bloomberg, November 15, 2013 =Moral hazard= A man at Occupy Wall Street protesting institutions deemed too big to fail Some critics have argued that \\"The way things are now banks reap profits if their trades pan out, but taxpayers can be stuck picking up the tab if their big bets sink the company.\\" Additionally, as discussed by Senator Bernie Sanders, if taxpayers are contributing to rescue these companies from bankruptcy, they \\"should be rewarded for assuming the risk by sharing in the gains that result from this government bailout\\". In this sense, Alan Greenspan affirms that, \\"Failure is an integral part, a necessary part of a market system.\\" Thereby, although the financial institutions that were bailed out were indeed important to the financial system, the fact that they took risk beyond what they would otherwise, should be enough for the Government to let them face the consequences of their actions. It would have been a lesson to motivate institutions to proceed differently next time. =Inability to prosecute= The political power of large banks and risks of economic impact from major prosecutions has led to use of the term \\"too big to jail\\" regarding the leaders of large financial institutions. On March 6, 2013, United States Attorney General Eric Holder testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the size of large financial institutions has made it difficult for the Justice Department to bring criminal charges when they are suspected of crimes, because such charges can threaten the existence of a bank and therefore their interconnectedness may endanger the national or global economy. \\"Some of these institutions have become too large,\\" Holder told the Committee. \\"It has an inhibiting impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate.\\" In this he contradicted earlier written testimony from a deputy assistant attorney general, who defended the Justice Department's \\"vigorous enforcement against wrongdoing\\". Holder has financial ties to at least one law firm benefiting from de facto immunity to prosecution, and prosecution rates against crimes by large financial institutions are at 20-year lows. Four days later, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard W. Fisher and Vice-President Harvey Rosenblum co- authored a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the failure of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to provide for adequate regulation of large financial institutions. In advance of his March 8 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fisher proposed requiring breaking up large banks into smaller banks so that they are \\"too small to save\\", advocating the withholding from mega-banks access to both Federal Deposit Insurance and Federal Reserve discount window, and requiring disclosure of this lack of federal insurance and financial solvency support to their customers. This was the first time such a proposal had been made by a high- ranking U.S. banking official or a prominent conservative. Other conservatives including Thomas Hoenig, Ed Prescott, Glenn Hubbard, and David Vitter also advocated breaking up the largest banks, but liberal commentator Matthew Yglesias questioned their motives and the existence of a true bipartisan consensus. In a January 29, 2013 letter to Holder, Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) had criticized this Justice Department policy citing \\"important questions about the Justice Department's prosecutorial philosophy\\". After receipt of a DoJ response letter, Brown and Grassley issued a statement saying, \\"The Justice Department's response is aggressively evasive. It does not answer our questions. We want to know how and why the Justice Department has determined that certain financial institutions are 'too big to jail' and that prosecuting those institutions would damage the financial system.\\" Kareem Serageldin pleaded guilty on November 22, 2013 for his role in inflating the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed, and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. As of April 30, 2014, Serageldin remains the \\"only Wall Street executive prosecuted as a result of the financial crisis\\" that triggered the Great Recession. Solutions The proposed solutions to the \\"too big to fail\\" issue are controversial. Some options include breaking up the banks, introducing regulations to reduce risk, adding higher bank taxes for larger institutions, and increasing monitoring through oversight committees. =Breaking up the largest banks= More than fifty economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions. This is advocated both to limit risk to the financial system posed by the largest banks as well as to limit their political influence. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in 2009 that: \\"In the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, large banks have been responsible for the bulk of the [bailout] cost to taxpayers. America has let 106 smaller banks go bankrupt this year alone. It's the mega-banks that present the mega-costs ... banks that are too big to fail are too big to exist. If they continue to exist, they must exist in what is sometimes called a \\"utility\\" model, meaning that they are heavily regulated.\\" He also wrote about several causes of the crisis related to the size, incentives, and interconnection of the mega-banks. =Reducing risk-taking through regulation= The leverage ratio, measured as debt divided by equity, for investment bank Goldman Sachs from 2003‚Äì2012. The lower the ratio, the greater the ability of the firm to withstand losses. The United States passed the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act in July 2010 to help strengthen regulation of the financial system in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2007. Dodd‚ÄìFrank requires banks to reduce their risk taking, by requiring greater financial cushions (i.e., lower leverage ratios or higher capital ratios), among other steps. Banks are required to maintain a ratio of high-quality, easily sold assets, in the event of financial difficulty either at the bank or in the financial system. These are capital requirements. Further, since the 2008 crisis, regulators have worked with banks to reduce leverage ratios. For example, the leverage ratio for investment bank Goldman Sachs declined from a peak of 25.2 during 2007 to 11.4 in 2012, indicating a much-reduced risk profile.Goldman Sachs-Annual Report 2012 The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act includes a form of the Volcker Rule, a proposal to ban proprietary trading by commercial banks. Proprietary trading refers to using customer deposits to speculate in risky assets for the benefit of the bank rather than customers. The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act as enacted into law includes several loopholes to the ban, allowing proprietary trading in certain circumstances. However, the regulations required to enforce these elements of the law were not implemented during 2013 and were under attack by bank lobbying efforts. Another major banking regulation, the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act from 1933, was effectively repealed in 1999. The repeal allowed depository banks to enter into additional lines of business. Senators John McCain and Elizabeth Warren proposed bringing back Glass-Steagall during 2013. =Too big to fail tax= Economist Willem Buiter proposes a tax to internalize the massive costs inflicted by \\"too big to fail\\" institution. \\"When size creates externalities, do what you would do with any negative externality: tax it. The other way to limit size is to tax size. This can be done through capital requirements that are progressive in the size of the business (as measured by value added, the size of the balance sheet or some other metric). Such measures for preventing the New Darwinism of the survival of the fittest and the politically best connected should be distinguished from regulatory interventions based on the narrow leverage ratio aimed at regulating risk (regardless of size, except for a de minimis lower limit).\\" =Monitoring= On November 16, 2018, a policy research and development entity, called the Financial Stability Board, released a list of 29 banks worldwide that they considered \\"systemically important financial institutions\\"‚Äîfinancial organisations whose size and role meant that any failure could cause serious systemic problems. * Agricultural Bank of China * Banco Santander * Bank of America * Bank of China * Bank of New York Mellon * Barclays * BNP Paribas * China Construction Bank * Citigroup * Cr√©dit Agricole * Credit Suisse * Deutsche Bank * Goldman Sachs * Groupe BPCE * HSBC * Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited * ING Bank * JPMorgan Chase * Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group * Mizuho Financial Group * Morgan Stanley * Royal Bank of Canada * Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale * Standard Chartered * State Street Corporation * Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group * UBS * Unicredit Group * Wells Fargo Notable views on the issue =Economists= More than fifty notable economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions. (See also Divestment.) Some economists such as Paul Krugman hold that bank crises arise from banks being under regulated rather than their size in itself. Krugman wrote in January 2010 that it was more important to reduce bank risk taking (leverage) than to break them up. Economist Simon Johnson has advocated both increased regulation as well as breaking up the larger banks, not only to protect the financial system but to reduce the political power of the largest banks. =Politicians= One of the most vocal opponents in the United States government of the \\"too big to fail\\" status of large American financial institutions in recent years has been Elizabeth Warren. At her first U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on February 14, 2013, Senator Warren pressed several banking regulators to answer when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, \\"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'.\\" Videos of Warren's questioning, centering on \\"too big to fail\\", became popular on the internet, amassing more than 1 million views in a matter of days. On March 6, 2013, United States Attorney General Eric Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Justice Department faces difficulty charging large banks with crimes because of the risk to the economy. Four days later, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard W. Fisher wrote in advance of a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference that large banks should be broken up into smaller banks, and both Federal Deposit Insurance and Federal Reserve discount window access should end for large banks. Other conservatives including Thomas Hoenig, Ed Prescott, Glenn Hubbard, and David Vitter also advocated breaking up the largest banks. =International organizations= On April 10, 2013, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the Economic Club of New York \\"too big to fail\\" banks had become \\"more dangerous than ever\\" and had to be controlled with \\"comprehensive and clear regulation [and] more intensive and intrusive supervision\\".United Press International (UPI), \\"Lagarde: 'Too big to fail' banks 'dangerous'\\" Retrieved April 13, 2013 = Other commentators = Ron Suskind claimed in his book Confidence Men that the administration of Barack Obama considered breaking up Citibank and other large banks that had been involved in the financial crisis of 2008. He said that Obama's staff, such as Timothy Geithner, refused to do so. The administration and Geithner have denied this version of events.Mark Landler, \\"Book Details Dissension in Obama Economic Team\\", New York Times, September 15, 2011Geithner denies ignoring Obama's request on banks Associated Press, via CBSnews.com, September 19, 2011 Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England during 2003‚Äì2013, called for cutting \\"too big to fail\\" banks down to size, as a solution to the problem of banks having taxpayer-funded guarantees for their speculative investment banking activities. \\"If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then, in the words of a distinguished American economist, they are too big. It is not sensible to allow large banks to combine high street retail banking with risky investment banking or funding strategies, and then provide an implicit state guarantee against failure.\\" Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling disagreed: \\"Many people talk about how to deal with the big banks ‚Äì banks so important to the financial system that they cannot be allowed to fail, but the solution is not as simple, as some have suggested, as restricting the size of the banks\\". Additionally, Alan Greenspan said that \\"If they're too big to fail, they're too big\\", suggesting U.S. regulators to consider breaking up large financial institutions considered \\"too big to fail\\". He added, \\"I don't think merely raising the fees or capital on large institutions or taxing them is enough ... they'll absorb that, they'll work with that, and it's totally inefficient and they'll still be using the savings.\\" Public opinion polls Gallup reported in June 2013 that: \\"Americans' confidence in U.S. banks increased to 26% in June, up from the record low of 21% the previous year. The percentage of Americans saying they have 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in U.S. banks is now at its highest point since June 2008, but remains well below its pre-recession level of 41%, measured in June 2007. Between 2007 and 2012, confidence in banks fell by half‚Äî20 percentage points.\\" Gallup also reported that: \\"When Gallup first measured confidence in banks in 1979, 60% of Americans had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in them‚Äîsecond only to the church. This high level of confidence, which hasn't been matched since, was likely the result of the strong U.S. banking system established after the 1930s Great Depression and the related efforts of banks and regulators to build Americans' confidence in that system.\\" Lobbying by banking industry In the US, the banking industry spent over $100 million lobbying politicians and regulators between January 1 and June 30, 2011. Lobbying in the finance, insurance and real estate industries has risen annually since 1998 and was approximately $500 million in 2012. Historical examples Prior to the 2008 failure and bailout of multiple firms, there were \\"too big to fail\\" examples from 1763 when Leendert Pieter de Neufville in Amsterdam and Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky in Berlin failed, and from the 1980s and 1990s. These included Continental Illinois and Long-Term Capital Management. =Continental Illinois case= An early example of a bank rescued because it was \\"too big to fail\\" was the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company during the 1980s. Distress The Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company experienced a fall in its overall asset quality during the early 1980s. Tight money, Mexico's default (1982) and plunging oil prices followed a period when the bank had aggressively pursued commercial lending business, Latin American syndicated loan business, and loan participation in the energy sector. Complicating matters further, the bank's funding mix was heavily dependent on large certificates of deposit and foreign money markets, which meant its depositors were more risk-averse than average retail depositors in the US. Payments crisis The bank held significant participation in highly speculative oil and gas loans of Oklahoma's Penn Square Bank.Belly Up, Phillip Zweig, Ballantine Books, 1986 When Penn Square failed in July 1982, the Continental's distress became acute, culminating with press rumors of failure and an investor-and-depositor run in early May 1984. In the first week of the run, the Fed permitted the Continental Illinois discount window credits on the order of $3.6 billion. Still in significant distress, the management obtained a further $4.5 billion in credits from a syndicate of money center banks the following week. These measures failed to stop the run, and regulators were confronted with a crisis. Regulatory crisis The seventh-largest bank in the nation by deposits would very shortly be unable to meet its obligations. Regulators faced a tough decision about how to resolve the matter. Of the three options available, only two were seriously considered. Even banks much smaller than the Continental were deemed unsuitable for resolution by liquidation, owing to the disruptions this would have inevitably caused. The normal course would be to seek a purchaser (and indeed press accounts that such a search was underway contributed to Continental depositors' fears in 1984). However, in the tight-money financial climate of the early 1980s, no purchaser was forthcoming. Besides generic concerns of size, contagion of depositor panic and bank distress, regulators feared the significant disruption of national payment and settlement systems. Of special concern was the wide network of correspondent banks with high percentages of their capital invested in the Continental Illinois. Essentially, the bank was deemed \\"too big to fail\\", and the \\"provide assistance\\" option was reluctantly taken. The dilemma then became how to provide assistance without significantly unbalancing the nation's banking system. Stopping the run To prevent immediate failure, the Federal Reserve announced categorically that it would meet any liquidity needs the Continental might have, while the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) gave depositors and general creditors a full guarantee (not subject to the $100,000 FDIC deposit-insurance limit) and provided direct assistance of $2 billion (including participations). Money center banks assembled an additional $5.3 billion unsecured facility pending a resolution and resumption of more-normal business. These measures slowed, but did not stop, the outflow of deposits. Controversy In a United States Senate hearing afterwards, the then Comptroller of the Currency C. T. Conover defended his position by admitting the regulators will not let the largest 11 banks fail. =Long-Term Capital Management= Long-Term Capital Management L.P. (LTCM) was a hedge fund management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut that utilized absolute-return trading strategies combined with high financial leverage. The firm's master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed in the late 1990s, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998 among 14 financial institutions for a $3.6 billion recapitalization (bailout) under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. LTCM was founded in 1994 by John W. Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a \\"new method to determine the value of derivatives\\". Initially successful with annualized returns of over 40% (after fees) in its first years, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months following the Russian financial crisis requiring financial intervention by the Federal Reserve, with the fund liquidating and dissolving in early 2000. International =Canada= In March 2013, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions announced that Canada's six largest banks, the Bank of Montreal, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, were too big to fail. Those six banks accounted for 90% of banking assets in Canada at that time. It noted that \\"the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered, and relative importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank (National).\\" =New Zealand= Despite the government's assurances, opposition parties and some media commentators in New Zealand say that the largest banks are too big to fail and have an implicit government guarantee. =United Kingdom= George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer under David Cameron (2010‚Äì2016), threatened to break up banks which are too big to fail. The too- big-to-fail idea has led to legislators and governments facing the challenge of limiting the scope of these hugely important organisations, and regulating activities perceived as risky or speculative‚Äîto achieve this regulation in the UK, banks are advised to follow the UK's Independent Commission on Banking Report.

Brimo is the \\"furious\\" aspect of the Furies. In the solemn moment when Medea picks the dire underworld root for Jason, she calls seven times upon Brimo, \\"she who haunts the night, the Nursing Mother [Kourotrophos]. In black weed And murky gloom she dwells, Queen of the Dead\\".Harrison 1922:552. The translation is Miss Harrison's; the scholiast on the passage identifies Brimo as Hecate: \\"they called her Brimo because of the terror and horror of her.\\" The Thessalian or Thracian word Brimo was foreign in Attica.Kerenyi 1967:92. Brimo-Hecate was worshipped at Pherae in Thessaly and has connections with Orphic religion, in which Persephone was prominent.R. E. Glanville Downey, \\"The \\"Pure\\" Meadow\\" Classical Philology 26.1 (January 1931, pp. 94-97), p 95. The Alexandra of Lycophron makes clear that when Hecuba is to be transformed into one of the hounds of the triple Hecate, Brimo is an epithet of the Thessalian goddess of the Underworld. Clement of Alexandria was of the opinion that Brimo was only a title of Demeter at Eleusis.Clement, Protrepticus i.15. At the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Christian writer Hippolytus reports,Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophoumena v.1 the hierophant announced the birth of Brimos: \\"The Mistress has given birth to a Holy Boy! Brimo has given birth to Brimos! that is, the Strong One to the Strong One\\"Potnia kouron Brimou Brimon. See Jane Ellen Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, 3rd ed. 1922:551ff; Karl Kerenyi, Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter 1967:92f. Brimos is thus the Holy Child of the Persephone, whose epiphany was at the heart of the Eleusinian Mysteries. In later, more worldly and cynical times, the archaic and fearful spirit could be mocked: in Lucian of Samosata's parody Oracle of the dead, Brimo is among the voters recorded by the magistrates of Hades: she groans her assent while Cerberus yelps \\"aye!\\". In the Greek magical papyri found in Egypt, Brimo makes a natural appearance in incantations connected with the catabasis ritual, of entering the Underworld and returning unharmed.Hans Dieter Betz, \\"Fragments from a Catabasis Ritual in a Greek Magical Papyrus\\" History of Religions 9.4 (May 1980), pp. 287-295.

The Demi-brigade amalgamated the various infantry organizations of the French Revolutionary infantry into a single unit. Each one was headed by a chef de brigade. The term \\"Demi-brigade\\" was chosen to avoid the feudal ancien r√©gime connotations of the term \\"R√©giment\\". Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the term to be abandoned in 1803, and the demi-brigades were renamed \\"r√©giments\\". The term was reused by certain later units in the French Army, such as the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade, the only permanent demi-brigade in the modern French Army.  Background  The French Legislative Assembly voted to declare war on Austria on 20 April 1792, and Prussia joined the war against France. 1792 ended well for France, having conquered the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) and parts of Germany. However, by early 1793, having guillotined Louis XVI of France on 21 January, France found itself at war with a coalition including Great Britain, the German States, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, and Spain in addition to Austria and Prussia. By mid-1793, France had lost all the conquests of 1792, was fighting on multiple fronts, and threatened with invasion. In an effort to reverse the setbacks, France took a number of measures. In late August 1793, instigated by Lazare Carnot, France introduced the lev√©e en masse, a mass conscription of young unmarried men. Also in late August, a law was passed to amalgamate the infantry, which saw the formation of Demi-brigades. Organized in 1794 as part of the French Revolutionary Armies. One division was made up of three brigades and one brigade was made up of 3 battalions.  Demi-brigade  The main problem faced by the French Revolution infantry was a lack of unity. The Army included three main types of infantry, all with different uniforms, organizations, equipment, and rates of pay: #regular infantry inherited from the old Royal regiments of the King, relatively well trained and equipped, dressed in white uniforms and wearing tarleton helmets #national guard units, less well-trained or equipped, with blue uniforms #f√©d√©r√© volunteer battalions, poorly trained and equipped, with no uniform other than a red phrygian cap and a cockade of France The variations between units created logistical problems, and animosity (due to different rates of pay) among units. The purpose of the Demi-brigade was to blend all three formations into a single unit, with identical equipment, organization, pay, and uniforms. A Demi-brigade consisted of three infantry battalions: one battalion of regulars (from old Royal regiments), and two battalions of either volunteers or national guards. Each battalion had the same organization of one company of grenadiers (heavy infantry) and eight companies of fusiliers (regular infantry). On paper, a Demi-brigade would have 2,437 men and four six-pounder cannons. The lev√©e en masse had swelled the ranks of the French army, so by August 1794 over a million men (1,075,000) were under arms.Blanning. p.120-121. Desertion was a problem; the active strength is estimated at 800,000 The Demi-brigade created a streamlined and simple method of organizing the infantry. Due to the current war situation, Demi-brigades were not formed until early 1794. Separate Demi-brigades were organised as line infantry (Demi-brigade de Bataille, 1792‚Äì96 and Demi-brigade d'Infanterie de Ligne, 1796‚Äì1803 ) and light infantry (Demi-brigade d'Infanterie L√©g√®re); all lacked uniformity in either weapons or equipment. As the French Revolutionary Wars progressed, demi-brigades were issued with specific coloured uniform jackets. By late 1794, France had completed the re- conquest of the Austrian Netherlands and Rhineland of Germany. The Demi- brigade survived the transition of the French government to the French Directory in 1795, the ending of the First Coalition in 1797 after Napoleon's successful campaigns in Italy, renewed conflict with a Second Coalition, and Napoleon seizing power in 1799 to create the French Consulate. End of the Revolutionary Demi-brigades Peace was restored under the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, and Napoleon ordered the reinstatement of the historic term \\"r√©giment\\" in 1803. The Demi-brigades were renamed as regiments. The term has been revived for various French Army units since the Napoleonic period. Perhaps the most famous unit to be termed a Demi-Brigade is the 13th Foreign Legion Demi- Brigade, the only permanent demi-brigade in the modern French Army.  Demi- brigades in Poland  In the Second Polish Republic, demi-brigades () were organized in the ranks of Border Protection Corps (in 1927) and National Defence units (from 1937).

He was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland and was the fourth son of the Laird of Torfoot. President William McKinley was a distant cousin. Brownlee founded the Philoclean Society at Rutgers in 1825. Basking Ridge, NJ named a street, Brownlee Place, in his honor. Career Brownlee studied at the University of Glasgow, receiving a Master's degree with honors. He was licensed as a minister by the Church of Scotland in 1808, before coming to the United States. Brownlee held several Associate Presbyterian pastorates in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and was master of a classical academy in Basking Ridge, NJ. He received an honorary degree from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1820, then the University of Glasgow gave him an honorary Doctor of Divinity in 1824 for his critical work on the Quakers. Brownlee's parishioners described him as an independent thinker and engaging speaker who often criticized the Roman Catholic Church, Universalism and other groups. He became professor of Latin and Greek at Rutgers College in 1825. The next year, Brownlee was installed as a minister at the Collegiate Reformed Dutch church in New York City. He served on a rotating basis among several Dutch Reformed Churches in Manhattan until 1860. In 1836, he helped found a group called The American Society to Promote the Principles of the Protestant Reformation. It was an anti-Catholic society, which was eventually absorbed into the American and Foreign Christian Union. It exists today as an ecumenical, mainline Protestant organization. Brownlee's career was cut short by a paralyzing stroke in 1843, from which he never fully recovered, even though his mind remained clear. He and his wife had nine children. Works Brownlee wrote the 1833 novel The Whigs of Scotland, a two-volume historical romance about The Killing Time. In the book's introduction, he argued that the Scottish resistance lit the fires of liberty against \\"the gigantic efforts of a civil and religious fanaticism\\" from England. Walter Scott, whose portrayal of the Covenanters Brownleee called an injustice, was the epic's inspiration. Brownlee also edited the Dutch Church Magazine (four volumes), founded The Protestant Vindicator newspaper in 1834, and published several books, including: * Inquiry into the Principles of the Quakers (1824) * The Whigs of Scotland: or, the Last of the Stuarts. An Historical Romance of the Scottish Persecution (1833) * Letters in the Roman Catholic Controversy (1834) * The Christian Youth's Book (1844) * Treatise on Popery (1847) * Lights and Shadows of Christian Life (1847) * Narrative of the Battles of Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge (1850) * Saint Patrick and the Western Apostolic Churches (1857) * Secret instructions of the Jesuits (1857) * Popery: An enemy to civil and religious liberty, and dangerous to our republic (1836)Amazon.com * References Category:Religious leaders from New York City Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States Category:American Presbyterian ministers Category:19th-century Presbyterian ministers Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Rutgers University faculty Category:1784 births Category:1860 deaths ","title":"William Craig Brownlee"},{"id":"9896604","text":"Margaret Wemyss, 3rd Countess of Wemyss and Countess of Cromarty (1 January 165911 March 1705) was a Scottish peer.

In the first part of the 20th century, and two other fungi causing stigmatomycosis (, ) made it virtually impossible to grow cotton in certain regions of the subtropics, causing severe economical losses.

This made it an interesting organism for industries, where genetically modified strains are still used to produce this vitamin.  as a model organism A few years ago, became recognized as an attractive model to study the growth of long and multinucleate fungal cells (hyphae) because of its small genome, haploid nuclei, and efficient gene targeting methods. It is generally assumed that a better understanding of filamentous fungal growth will greatly stimulate the development of novel fungicides. Its use as a model organism is particularly promising because of the high level of gene order conservation (synteny) between the genomes of and the yeast . Genome The complete sequencing and annotation of the entire genome, as published in 2004, was initiated when a significant degree of gene synteny was observed in preliminary studies in comparison to the genome of budding yeast, . This not only helped to improve gene annotation of , but also allowed the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of both organisms. and originated from a common ancestor which carried about 5000 genes. Divergence of these two close relatives started some 100 million years ago. One branch of evolution involving up to 100 viable genome rearrangements (translocations and inversions), a few million base pair changes, and a limited number of gene deletions, duplications and additions lead to modern with its 4718 protein- coding genes and 9.2 million base pairs (smallest genome of a free-living eukaryote yet characterized) spread over seven chromosomes. The genome of underwent a more eventful evolution, which includes a whole-genome duplication. Despite the long evolutionary history of the two organisms and fundamentally different ways of growth and development, the complete synteny map of both genomes reveals 95% of genes are orthologs of genes, and 90% map within blocks of synteny (syntenic homologs).

This is followed by apical growth, extending two germ tubes in succession on opposing sites of the germ bubble. More axes of polarity are established with lateral branch formation in young mycelium. Maturation is characterized by apical branching (tip splitting) and a dramatic increase of growth speed (up to 200 Œºm/h at 30 ¬∞C), which enables it to cover an 8 cm Petri dish of full medium in about seven days. Sporulation is thought to be induced by nutrient deprivation, leading to contraction at the septa, cytokinesis and subsequent abscission of sporangia which contain up to eight haploid spores. Hyphae are compartmentalized by septa, which in young parts appear as rings that allow transfer of nuclei and in older parts may appear as closed discs. Compartments typically contain around eight nuclei.

She is best known for her appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling under her real name and as Peaches. Professional wrestling career Fullington debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the early 1990s under the ring name \\"Peaches\\" alongside her husband, The Sandman. In 1993, she feuded with Terrible Tigra, defeating her in a \\"catfight humiliation\\" match at the Super Summer Sizzler Spectacular. In 1994, while temporarily blinded following a match, The Sandman inadvertently struck his wife. When The Sandman recovered and saw his tag team partner Tommy Cairo assisting Peaches to her feet, he attacked Cairo. The Sandman subsequently became estranged from his wife, and Peaches became the valet of Cairo. Cairo and Peaches faced The Sandman and Woman in an intergender \\"Singapore Caning\\" match on May 14 at When Worlds Collide. After the match, The Sandman and Woman attacked Cairo and Peaches. In late 1994, The Sandman was once again blinded after a lit cigarette was pushed into his eye during an \\"I Quit\\" match with Tommy Dreamer. The Sandman subsequently claimed that he would have to retire as a result, with Woman abandoning him as a result. During The Sandman's retirement ceremony at November to Remember, Peaches attempted to reconcile with him, but was caned by the returning Woman. Woman threatened The Sandman, drawing Dreamer to the ring, at which point The Sandman revealed that he was not in fact blinded and attacked Dreamer. Fullington, now using her real name, returned to ECW in 1996 during The Sandman's feud with Raven. Fullington and her son Tyler were brought in by booker Paul Heyman, who wanted to experiment with more soap operaesque storylines. In the course of the feud, Raven attempted to play mind games with The Sandman by brainwashing Lori to become part of his entourage Raven's Nest. At Hardcore Heaven on June 22, 1996, Raven revealed that Tyler had also joined his side. Lori and Tyler assisted Raven in his matches against The Sandman and his new valet, Missy Hyatt. The family reconciled in 1997 after Raven turned on Lori and Tyler, and The Sandman came to their rescue. Fullington returned to ECW once more in 2000, assisting The Sandman in his feud with The Network. In the course of the feud, Rhino gored her through a table at Living Dangerously, piledrove her through a table at Hardcore Heaven and thrust her head into a toilet at Heatwave. Fullington left ECW once more upon the cessation of the feud in mid-2000. In 2002, Fullington appeared alongside The Sandman in Xtreme Pro Wrestling.

A friend of Pliny the Younger and Hadrian, he was twice consul, governed provinces, commanded armies and ended his career as Urban prefect of Rome. Bruttius‚Äô life and career left few coherent traces in the literary record, but a number of inscriptions, including his complete cursus honorum, fills out the picture considerably.  Life  Pliny, writing to Praesens, refers to him as a LucanianPliny, Letters, VII.3 and an inscription concerning his son has been found at Volceii in Lucania. His father has been identified as Lucius Bruttius Maximus, proconsul of Cyprus in AD 80.Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 140 As Praesens was the first of his family to hold the consulship, he was considered a novus homo. The element \\"Lucius Fulvius Rusticus\\" in his polyonymous name is commonly agreed to be his maternal grandfather's name, thus connecting Praesens to the Fulvii Rustici (see gens Fulvius), a senatorial family from Cisalpine Gaul. From an inscription recovered in Mactaris (modern Siliana in Tunisia), his career in imperial service can be reconstructed. As a teenager, Praesens was a member of the tresviri capitales, one of the magistracies that comprised the vigintiviri. This was the least desirable office to hold, for men who held that office rarely had a successful career: Anthony Birley could find only five tresviri capitales who went on to be governors of consular imperial provinces.Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 5 However, it is clear that Praesens succeeded despite this inauspicious beginning. Next he received the commission for the tribunus laticlavius in Legio I Minervia, when he led a vexillation from Germania Inferior to Pannonia and earned dona militaria, or military decorations, for service on the Danube in the emperor Domitian‚Äôs campaigns. He served as quaestor in Hispania Baetica, and it may have been at this time that he first became friends with the young Hadrian, but thereafter he retired from public life. In his book on the Roman Senate in this period, Richard Talbert notes that some senators in this period, including Praesens, abandoned their efforts at climbing the chain of offices, discouraged at the lengthy wait they faced to achieve the office of either praetor or consul.Talbert, The Senate of Imperial Rome (Princeton: University Press, 1984), p. 23 Pliny in 107 wrote to Praesens urging him to no longer remain on his rural estates in Campania and Lucania but to return to Rome and to public life. His language suggests Praesens was an Epicurean in his tastes and beliefs, something he shared with Hadrian. Praesens is next heard of in the winter of 114/115, during Trajan's Parthian war, commanding Legio VI Ferrata, during which, according to a fragment of the Parthica of Arrian he marched in deep snow (having secured snowshoes from native guides) across the Armenian Taurus Mountains to reach Tigranakert. After a spell as curator of the Via Latina, he was legatus or governor of Cilicia when Trajan died in that province in 117.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), p. 361 Two fragmentary military diplomas, published in 2002, attest he was suffect consul as the colleague of Quintus Aburnius Caedicianus; while there is insufficient text to precisely date this document, this pair are thought to have held the fasces at some point in the months September-December 118 or July-October 119.Paul Holder, Roman Military Diplomas V (London: Institute of Advanced Studies, 2006), Nos. 349, 350 Subsequently, Bruttius was curator operum publicorum, or overseer of the public works of Rome, then governed Cappadocia (121-124) followed by a tenure as governor of Moesia Inferior from 124 to 128.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), pp. 155-164 He was Proconsul of Africa in 134/135Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), p. 176 and appears to have been governor of Syria in 136 or 137, anomalous for a senior former Proconsul, but perhaps empowered to conduct diplomacy with the Parthians. In a resplendent end to a long career, his second consulship came in 139, as colleague of the new emperor Antoninus Pius, and at the same time he became Praefectus urbi, succeeding Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus. However Praesens died in this office the following year, as revealed by a fragment of the Fasti Ostienses published in 1982. We know from the Tunisian inscription that Praesens was a member of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, one of the more prestigious collegia of Roman priesthoods. Eusebius of Caesarea and John Malalas both cite a writer called 'Bruttius' or 'Boutios' as a source for events in the reign of Domitian.  Family  In the letter mentioned above, Pliny alludes to Praesens' wife, whom he describes as a native of Campania; based on the name of their son, her name has been inferred to be \\"Laberia\\". Authorities differ whether she should be identified with Laberia Hostilia Crispina, a rich heiress and daughter of Manius Laberius Maximus. Not enough is known about Crispina to say whether she was from Campania, which would clinch the identification, or from elsewhere. If from elsewhere, Laberia would be his second wife. In either case, Laberia bore Praesens a son, Lucius Fulvius Gaius Bruttius Praesens Laberius Maximus, who became consul in 153 and 180. Through his son, Praesens became the paternal grandfather of at least two people: the future Roman empress Bruttia Crispina, who married Commodus; and the consul Lucius Bruttius Quintius Crispinus.Ronald Syme, \\"People in Pliny\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 58 (1968), p. 150 Sources Category:68 births Category:140 deaths Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Roman governors of Cappadocia Category:Roman governors of Cilicia Category:Roman governors of Lower Moesia Category:Roman governors of Africa Category:Senators of the Roman Empire Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd-century Romans Category:People from Roman Anatolia Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Bruttii Category:Fulvii Category:Generals of Domitian Category:Generals of Trajan ","title":"Gaius Bruttius Praesens Lucius Fulvius Rusticus"},{"id":"9896791","text":"Bertila of Spoleto (also Bertilla) (c. 860 ‚Äì December 915) was the wife of Berengar I of Italy, and by marriage Queen consort of Italy and Holy Roman Empress.G.

Her paternal grandfather was Adelchis I of Spoleto, second son of Suppo I, and her paternal aunt was Engelberga, wife of Louis II of Italy.Skinner, Women, p. 100. She married Berengar, margrave of Friuli, sometime between 870 and 880.Rosenwein, 'Family Politics', p. 256; G. Arnaldi, ‚ÄòBertilla‚Äô, p. 529.. Berengar became King of Italy in 888, with Bertila as his queen. However, her husband lost his throne in the following year to Guy of Spoleto. Berengar began to reassert his power in 896, after the fall of the Spoleto family, and the withdrawal of Emperor Arnulf from the peninsula; however, a defeat by a Magyar army, and the decision by the Italian nobles to appoint Louis of Provence as King of Italy, delayed the King and Queen's formal return to power until 905. Throughout this period Bertila frequently intervened in Berengar's diplomas, particularly in favour of churches and monasteries.Schiaparelli, Diplomi di Berengario, nos. 10, 14, 20, 32, 38, 40, 42, 49, 50, 52, 55, 56, 60, 62, 67, 72, 104, 113.

In 915 Bertila became Holy Roman Empress, after her husband was crowned Emperor.G. Arnaldi, ‚ÄòBertilla‚Äô. She died this same year, probably of poisoning, and perhaps at her husband's request.Gesta Berengari, II, vv. 79-80, p. 375 ; Rosenwein, 'Family politics,' p. 258. At about this time, Bertila had been accused of infidelity, although this charge was frequently made against the wives of kings in this period, and often masked wider political intrigues.Reuter, Annals of Fulda, a.889, p. 139 and n2; Rosenwein, 'Family Politics,' p. 258 and n46. Bertila was also accused of taking advice from an evil 'Circe'.Gesta Berengari, II, vv. 79-80, p. 375 . Tiziana Lazzari suggests that this is a reference to Bertha of Tuscany, wife of Adalbert II, Margrave of Tuscany, who was in open opposition to Berengar's rule.Lazzari, 'Donne,' pp. 213-216. By December 915 Berengar had remarried, to Anna of Provence, daughter of Louis the Blind.Schiaparelli, Diplomi di Berengario, no. 107; Previt√© Orton, 'Italy', p. 336. Issue Bertila and Berengar had several children. By 908, their daughter, Bertha, was abbess of Santa Giulia in Brescia, where her paternal aunt, Gisela, had once been a nun.

The Rand Daily Mail was resurrected as a website by Times Media Group, who hold rights to the original title, in October 2014.  History  Soon after it was founded in 1902 by Harry Cohen, The Rand Daily Mail was bought by mining magnate Abe Bailey.History of the press in South Africa During the apartheid years, journalists like Benjamin Pogrund reported on political and economic issues affecting black South Africans about which whites were largely ignorant. Pogrund, for example, reported on the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. In 1965 Pogrund wrote in the paper about prison conditions, based on the evidence of prisoners including Harold Strachan.http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/special%5Cprison/pogrund.htm Strachan was sent to prison for a year and a half as a result. On 3 November 1978 Rand Daily Mail journalists Mervyn Rees and Chris Day reported on the use of public funds since 1973 to set up a disinformation network in South Africa and abroad. The money was used in attempts to buy The Washington Star, and to set up The Citizen as a government-controlled counter to The Rand Daily Mail.The Information Scandal sahistory.org Hounded by the state, the paper's board decided to moderate its content for the sake of attracting more affluent white readers. This strategy led to financial losses and the newspaper was forced to close in 1985, eighty-three years after it was founded. After its closure, the black newspaper The Sowetan described The Rand Daily Mail as the first white newspaper to regard blacks as human beings. Yet for most of the apartheid period (1948‚Äì1990) the paper suffered from poor management, government infiltration, and state censorship. The management often tried to replace more liberal editors with conservative ones. After the closure of The Rand Daily Mail, some of its journalists (like Anton Harber and Irwin Manoim) pooled their severance pay to start the Weekly Mail (now Mail & Guardian), which carried on the anti-apartheid stance of its predecessor.

It begins north of downtown Baltimore, just north of Penn Station, and continues north through Baltimore County almost to the Pennsylvania state line. The road passes through the communities of Hampden, Medfield, Cross Keys, and Mount Washington in the city, and Brooklandville and Butler in Baltimore County. The entire length of MD 25 that uses Falls Road--and its locally maintained continuation north to Alesia--is a Maryland Scenic Byway, named the Falls Road Scenic Byway.Maryland State Highway Administration, Maryland Scenic Byways, , accessed June 17, 2007 Route description =City of Baltimore= MD 25 begins as a one-way pair, Lafayette Street westbound and Lanvale Street eastbound, at the one-way pair comprising MD 2, Calvert Street northbound and St. Paul Street southbound, in the Charles North neighborhood of Baltimore and within the North Central Historic District. Lafayette Street and Lanvale Street head west as two-lane streets and intersects another one-way pair of streets, northbound Charles Street and southbound Maryland Avenue. Within the Charles-Lafayette-Maryland-Lanvale block is a plethora of historic sites: the Hans Schuler Studio and Residence on Lafayette Street, the Charles Theatre and Baltimore City Passenger Railway Power House and Car Barn on Charles Street, and rowhouses comprising the Buildings at 1601-1830 St. Paul Street and 12-20 E. Lafayette Street. West of Maryland Avenue, Lafayette Street and Lanvale Street merge into two-lane undivided Falls Road, which curves northwest and briefly parallels Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which enters Penn Station serving Amtrak and MARC's Penn Line to the southeast. As the railroad tracks veer away toward Washington, MD 25 begins to parallel the east side of Jones Falls and MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink line, which is on the west side of the stream, at the southern end of the stream's deep valley. The highway passes underneath the Howard Street and US 1/US 40 Truck (North Avenue) bridges and by the Baltimore Streetcar Museum buildings and sheds. MD 25 parallels MTA Maryland's Route 25, which comprises the reconstructed streetcar tracks used for streetcar rides from the museum site north under CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and past the remains of a roundhouse to the Museum's streetcar turning loop just south of the 28th Street and 29th Street's bridges over the Jones Falls valley. MD 25 passes under Wyman Park Drive just south of the former Stieff Silver Company factory building and Mount Vernon Mill No. 1 (recently renovated for apartments and condos), down the hill from the Stone Hill Historic District. MD 25 southbound in Baltimore At the southern end of the Hampden neighborhood to the east and the Woodberry community on the western hills, MD 25 ascends from the Jones Falls valley and temporarily expands to a four-lane divided street at its ramps with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway). The partial interchange, which includes ramps from southbound MD 25 to southbound I-83 and from northbound I-83 to northbound MD 25, is next to the historic home \\"Evergreen on the Falls\\" now occupied by the Maryland association of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). The street becomes undivided and reduces to two lanes at the main street of Hampden, 36th Street or The Avenue. North of 41st Street, MD 25 passes between the neighborhoods of Medfield to the west and Hoes Heights on the east. The highway intersects Cold Spring Lane next to the joint campus of the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (Baltimore City public high school specializing in math, science, engineering and technology) and the all-girls Western High School and passes between the Village of Cross Keys (an apartment-condo complex with a small shopping center/mall) on the west and the community of Roland Park on the hills above to the east as a four-lane undivided highway. MD 25 intersects Northern Parkway, (built over and segmented with former Belvedere Avenue) then descends again into the Jones Falls valley and passes through the center of Mount Washington. The neighborhood contains the North Baltimore Aquatic Club, where American Olympics team member Michael Phelps trained, and an intersection with Kelly Avenue and its Bridge which connects to the west with the hilly community of Mount Washington, where the highway reduces to two lanes. Here also is the former campus of old Mount Saint Agnes College for women, and its famous \\"Octagon House\\", now a corporate campus for several financial and insurance companies), MD 25 leaves the city of Baltimore at its 1919 City Limits just south of West Lake Avenue. =Baltimore to Alesia= View south along MD 25 at MD 137 in Whitehouse MD 25 enters the Bare Hills Historic District and Bare Hills area of Baltimore County. The state highway crosses over the Baltimore Light RailLink line again and the Jones Falls next to the Falls Road station. The station is accessed via unsigned MD 746 (Lakeside Drive), which partially runs underneath MD 25 along the latter highway's overpass on its way to the station parking lot. The state highway ascends from the stream valley and curves northwest between Robert E. Lee Memorial Park (a Baltimore City park located just barely in Baltimore County) with its historic Lake Roland and dam from the old 1860 city waterworks system to the northeast and the Bare Hills House on the southbound side of the highway. MD 25 continues north through a well-forested affluent area between Towson (county seat of Baltimore County) to the east and Pikesville to the west with its headquarters for the Maryland State Police. The highway descends to and crosses Jones Falls twice on either side of an underpass of I-83. To the north of the second crossing of the stream, MD 25 has a four-leg intersection with MD 133 (Old Court Road) and Ruxton Road; the latter road has a half-diamond interchange with I-83 that allows access to and from Baltimore. North of MD 133, the highway passes the Rockland Historic District and the historic home \\"Rockland\\" in the community of Brooklandville. MD 25 crosses over I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) then passes \\"The Cloisters\\" (former Baltimore City children's museum) and the Brooklandville House before crossing Jones Falls one last time at the east end of the Green Spring Valley as the highway enters Brooklandville. MD 25 has a ramp to the Jones Falls Expressway as the road begins to parallel the expressway. The highway, which is unsigned MD 25A north of I-695 (at which point I-83 continues east on I-695 to follow the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway), has its northern terminus at an orthogonal intersection with MD 25 and Joppa Road, which heads east toward Towson. MD 25 makes a sharp turn east at the north end of the parallel section, then turns north onto a four- lane divided highway extending north from the freeway. The highway passes through a commercial area to MD 130 (Greenspring Valley Road), north of which the highway becomes two lanes again. At the northern end of Brooklandville, the state highway meets the western end of MD 131 (Seminary Avenue) and passes by the campuses of Maryvale Preparatory School and Episcopal Church twin institutions, St. Paul's School (for boys) and St. Paul's School for Girls, founded by Old St. Paul's Church in downtown Baltimore at North Charles and East Saratoga Streets, the area's oldest church, founded 1692. MD 25 continues through the region of estate homes until the highway reaches Shawan Road and Tufton Avenue at the hamlet of Shawan, north of which the landscape shifts to farmland. The northern end of Falls Road at Schalk Road No. 1 near Alesia MD 25 crosses Western Run and passes through the village of Butler, where the highway meets MD 128 (Butler Road). The highway follows Blackrock Run and Indian Run through a pair of ridges. At the second ridge, MD 25 has a Y intersection with MD 88 (Black Rock Road) at Coopersville. The state highway crosses Blackrock Run again and intersects MD 137 (Mount Carmel Road) at Whitehouse between Hampstead and Hereford. MD 25 reaches its northern terminus at Beckleysville Road west of Beckleysville and Prettyboy Reservoir near the Baltimore-Carroll county line. Falls Road continues northwest for as a county highway into northeastern Carroll County. Just north of its intersection with Hoffmanville Road near Alesia, the highway becomes a narrow gravel road. Falls Road has a grade crossing of CSX's Hanover Subdivision, then becomes a paved road again shortly before its northern terminus at Schalk Road No. 1 near Gunpowder Falls north of Alesia and south of Lineboro near the Maryland- Pennsylvania state line. History =Turnpike= Signboard showing toll rates On the December 27, 1791, the Maryland General Assembly authorized Elisha Tyson, William & Charles Jessop, John Ellicott, George Leggett, Robert Long, Jacob Hart, and John Stricker to lay out a road, not to exceed wide, from their flour mill-seats on Jones Falls, then in Baltimore County, southerly to Baltimore Town, thereafter known as the Falls Road. [20] On January 19, 1805, A company known as 'The President, Managers and Company, of the Falls Turnpike Road', more commonly called the 'Falls Turnpike', was incorporated and chartered by the Maryland General Assembly. The company was authorized to build and operate a turnpike \\"for the accommodation of the inhabitants on Jones's Falls, and the country adjacent\\", running from \\"the ford by Messieurs [William] Patterson and [John] Stricker's mill\\" northerly to \\"the cross roads by the limekiln of Richard Caton\\" (Brooklandville). Construction was to begin within two years and finish within five. (Completion was extended to January 1, 1813 by the General Assembly on December 23, 1808.Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1808, Chapter LXIX: \\"An act to extend the time for the president, managers and company, of the Falls turnpike road, to complete the said road.\\") The law included a statement that \\"it would be unjust and improper to extend the said turnpike so as to make the same intersect the York-town turnpike...drawing off from said road any portion of the trade that now passes down the said road into Old-town, in the city of Baltimore\\", but allowed the Falls Turnpike to extend south to the York-town Turnpike (Greenmount Avenue) \\"at or near a stone bridge opposite the old mill of Josiah Pennington\\" (Belvidere Street across Jones Falls, just south of Hoffman Street and east of Barclay Street) with the consent of that company.Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1804, Chapter XCI: \\"An act to incorporate a company to make a turnpike road to lead from the cross roads near Richard Caton's limekiln, in Baltimore county, nearly in the direction of Jones's Falls, to the city of Baltimore.\\" A law passed January 25, 1806 allowed the company to build this extension without the approval of the York- town Turnpike.Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1805, Chapter XLVIII: \\"A supplement to an act, entitled, An act to incorporate a company to make a turnpike road to lead from the cross roads near Richard Caton's limekiln, in Baltimore county, nearly in the direction of Jones's Falls, to the city of Baltimore.\\" On December 28, 1812, the General Assembly \\"confirmed and established\\" the completed roadway.Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1812, Chapter 152: \\"An act to establish and confirm the Falls Turnpike road from the city of Baltimore to Richard Caton's Lime Kiln.\\" According to Richard Caton, whose limekiln was located near the north end of the turnpike, and who was one of the officers of the company, the turnpike was \\"excepted to unite the trade of the North with Baltimore...in a direct line to Hanover and Carlisle.\\" This extension was delayed by what Caton thought was a desire to keep the Baltimore and Reister's-town Turnpike's monopoly.Maryland Geological Survey Volume Three, 1899, p. 170 A public road extending from Brooklandville north-northwesterly to George Kerlinger's Mill on Gunpowder Falls \\\\- near but not on the Pennsylvania state line - was authorized by a state law passed December 24, 1808.Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1808, Chapter XCIV: \\"An act for opening a certain road in Baltimore county therein mentioned.\\" The Falls Turnpike began building the road, but lacked funds to complete it, and another law passed January 15, 1817 allowed the company to increase their capitalization and to charge tolls for travel on the extension.Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1816, Chapter 115: \\"A Further Supplement to an act, entitled, An act to Incorporate a Company to make a Turnpike Road to lead from the Cross Roads near Richard Caton's Limekiln, in Baltimore County, nearly in the direction of Jones's Falls, to the City of Baltimore.\\" On March 12, 1828, the General Assembly ordered the company to, within six months, return this extension to the county for use as a free public road, and the turnpike was thus cut back to Brooklandville.Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1827, Chapter 178: \\"A further supplement to an act, entitled an act, to incorporate a company to make a Turnpike Road to lead from the Cross Roads near Richard Caton's lime kiln, in Baltimore county nearly in the direction of Jones' Falls to the City of Baltimore.\\" The turnpike began at the intersection of Cathedral Street and Howard Street (now the diagonal portion of Chase Street, intersecting Cathedral Street about half a block south of Biddle Street). It proceeded north on Cathedral Street, crossing Jones Falls a bit north of North Avenue to the current Falls Road.Warner & Hanna, , 1801Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1805, Chapter XXXIV: \\"An act to straighten the road leading into Howard-street in the city of Baltimore.\\"Archives of Maryland Online, Session Laws, 1810, Chapter LXXXIX: \\"An act to authorise a Lottery or Lotteries in the City of Baltimore for the purposes therein mentioned.\\"Map of the city and county of Baltimore, Maryland. From original surveys by J.C. Sidney, C.E., ca. 1857 After North Avenue was built, the turnpike was separated from Cathedral Avenue, ending at North Avenue east of Jones Falls.Atlas of fifteen miles (24 km) around Baltimore, including Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Compiled, drawn, and published from actual surveys, by G. M. Hopkins, 1878 The description of allowed rates of toll given in the legislative charter are lengthy, and specify that, for instance, a horse and rider shall be charged 6.25 cents, and a two-horse stagecoach 25 cents, for the entire distance, and a smaller amount in proportion to the distance traveled. Five miles were completed by 1811, allowing the company to erect a toll gate; a second gate had been placed by 1819. Due to the impossibility of determining how far a customer had traveled, the Baltimore County Court allowed the company to charge a full toll for passing over any part of the road.Printed by John D. Toy, Baltimore, Laws, Documents and Judicial Decisions, Relating to the Baltimore and Fredericktown, York and Reisterstown, Cumberland and Boonsborough Turnpike Companies, 1841, pp. 52-55 The southern toll gate was located one to two blocks north of North Avenue at the bridge over Jones Falls,Baltimore County Circuit Court, Land Survey, Subdivision, and Condominium Plats, Land Records EHA 67, p. 247, North Central Railway Company deed to Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, July 2, 1870 and the other was several miles north, near Cross Keys. =State highway= MD 25 northbound past Broadway Road/Padonia Road in Baltimore County Falls Road was paved in macadam as a state-aid road--the road was designed by the Highway Division of the Maryland Geological Survey and paved by the county with equal financial support by the state and county--from Kelly Avenue in Mount Washington to Padonia Road by 1910. The highway was paved as a -wide vitrified brick state road--the road was designed by the Maryland State Roads Commission and its construction fully financed by the state--from 36th Avenue in Hampden north to the contemporary city limits at Roland Heights Avenue in Medfield in 1911. Falls Road from Roland Heights Avenue north to Kelly Avenue in Mount Washington was paved with a -wide vitrified brick surface in 1912. By 1921, Falls Road had been surfaced in macadam from Padonia Road to Ridge Road south of Shawan and then in concrete the remaining distance to Shawan. That same year, the Maryland State Roads Commission planned to reconstruct Falls Road in Baltimore from 36th Street south to North Avenue; that stretch was paved with concrete by 1923. The portion of Falls Road from Butler to Whitehouse, which was then known as Blackrock, was planned as part of an extension of Park Heights Avenue via Butler Road and other highways east of Reisterstown as early as 1910 and as late as 1921. Starting in 1924, Falls Road was paved with concrete north from Shawan. The improved road reached a spot north of Butler by 1927 and to Whitehouse in 1928. The concrete highway was extended to Gunpowder Road in 1930 and to its present terminus at Beckleysville Road by 1933. MD 25 was one of the original state-numbered highway designation assigned by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1927. By 1930, the Baltimore-Shawan portion of the highway had been widened to a minimum width of . Shortly after 1930, work began on a bridge over the Northern Central Railroad, whose right-of-way is now followed by the Baltimore Light RailLink, at Bare Hills; this structure was completed by 1934. MD 25's southern terminus was Charles Street by 1934 and MD 2 by 1956. The state highway's only major relocation was in 1962 and 1963 when the northern stub of the Jones Falls Expressway, now MD 25A, and the associated four-lane divided section of MD 25 in Brooklandville were constructed. With the completion of the Jones Falls Expressway, I-83 became the main highway from the north into downtown Baltimore and MD 25 was relegated to a local thoroughfare. MD 25 was closed for several months for the replacement of the highway's bridges over the Baltimore Light RailLink and Jones Falls at Bare Hills in 1991 and over I-695 near Brooklandville in 1996. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 25A is the designation for the portion of the Jones Falls Expressway north of the Baltimore Beltway in Brooklandville. The highway begins at the interchange between the Jones Falls Expressway and the Baltimore Beltway, which is a cloverleaf interchange with a flyover ramp for the transfer of southbound I-83 from the east-west beltway to the north-south expressway. The Jones Falls Expressway continues south as I-83 into Baltimore. The Baltimore Beltway carries I-695 west toward Pikesville and both I-83 and I-695 east toward Towson, where I-83 splits north toward York. The four-lane freeway ends at a four-leg intersection with MD 25 (Falls Road) and Joppa Road. Joppa Road heads east toward Towson; MD 25 heads south as a two-lane road from the west leg of the intersection and north as a short four-lane divided highway continuation of the expressway. The only intermediate junction on MD 25A is a direct ramp from MD 25 to southbound MD 25A at the southern point of where the two highways run parallel. All of MD 25A is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length.

The station is located along the track between Helsinki and Turku, about 87 km west from Helsinki Central railway station and serves as a connection point between three different tracks: the main track between Helsinki and Turku, a branch track to the city of Hanko, and a former privately owned track between Karis and Hyvink√§√§, currently largely disused. Nearly all long-distance trains between Helsinki and Turku stop at the Karis railway station. The station is also the northern terminus of Karis-Hanko regional trains (railbuses) and used to be the westernmost terminus of Helsinki commuter rail (Y-line) in 2002‚Äì2016, although the station remains to be served by one Y-line commuter train service to Helsinki in the morning, departure time at 5.43. The station also serves cargo traffic. There are also three bus departures from the Karis railway station to Kirkkonummi, via Ing√• on weekdays (Mon-Fri).  History  The Karis railway station was founded to serve a privately owned track between Hanko and Hyvink√§√§, and taken into use in 1873. After a few years, the privately owned track had only made a loss, and the station was transferred over to the Finnish state. The station became a crossing point in 1899, when the track between Karis and Turku was opened. The track between Karis and Pasila was opened in 1903.  Departure tracks  There are four platform tracks at the Karis railway station used by the passenger trains. * Track 1 is the departure track for Karis-Hanko regional trains. * Track 2 is the departure track for eastbound long-distance services, towards Helsinki. * Track 3 is the departure track for westbound long-distance services, towards Turku. * Track 4 is the departure track for Y-line commuter train to Helsinki, departure time 5:43.

Collections Over the years purchases and gifts have expanded the size of the cabinet. 1899 the cabinet bought the collection of Alb√©ric du Chastel. It consists of approximately 800 Greek and Roman pieces. Some of these are rare, for instance the aureus of Uranius Antoninus. One year later it obtained its most precious gift. After the death of major collector Lucien de Hirsch, his mother gave his collection to the Belgium State. The biggest treasure of this collection is without doubt the tetradrachm of Aetna, supposedly the most valuable item in the entire field of numismatics, whatever the period or the place of striking. In 1904 the cabinet was again enlarged with a big collection. The H. Surmont de Volsberghe collection brought the cabinet many hundreds of coins, medallions, decorations and counters. In 1924 the Cabinet shared with the University Foundation the collection of count B. de Jonghe. Soon after this transaction, the foundation handed its part over to the cabinet. In 1971 the National Bank of Belgium made the cabinet gatekeeper of the 'treasure of Liberchies' (hundreds of Roman aurei).

Jones as a consultant to Sir Charles Ross, 9th Baronet, and his Ross Rifle Company of Quebec, Canada for use as a Canadian military cartridge as a replacement for the .303 British, and in a civilianised and sporterised version of his controversial Mark II and Mk III Ross rifle, and first commercially produced by Eley Brothers of London, England, in late 1907.  History  The .280 Ross was the first practical cartridge to reach the edge of muzzle velocity. Sir Charles Ross did many attempts while in the process of creating the \\"perfect cartridge\\", one of them leading to the creation of the .28-1906 in November 1906. Ross also tried to convince the British War Department to adopt the .280 Ross (and his rifle) as the new service cartridge, but World War I came along and dashed his hopes. The .280 also paved the way for Sir Charles' newly designed bullets, such as \\"Full Metal Patch\\" and \\"Metal Covered Hollow Point\\". The Ross Mk III rifle was especially developed to handle the .280. The .280 (and the Ross Rifle) won the famous Bisley international matches in 1908, 1912 and 1913 (King's Prize) plus many other prizes in different competitions on both sides of the Atlantic.  Performance  Firing a bullet at a muzzle velocity of , the new cartridge qualified for the contemporary designation \\"magnum\\". It was used as a military sniper's cartridge,\\"Out of Nowhere: A History of the Military Sniper\\", book by Martin Pegler, Osprey Publishing, 2004, p. 135 in addition to achieving some celebrity as an African plains game cartridge in the years immediately following the First World War. However the large capacity case was capable of moving the bullets available at that time faster than would be desirable for reliable expansion, causing them to fragment rather than penetrate properly.\\"The .280 Ross (.280 Rimless)\\" by Chuck Hawks Commercially, the .280 Ross was popular for stalkers in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries like New Zealand and Canada, chambered in sporting versions of the Ross rifle. It was found to be an excellent cartridge on red deer with a terminal performance comparable to the modern .270 Winchester or .280 Remington. Compared to other cartridges of the period such as the 6.5x54mm Mannlicher, 7x57 Mauser and the .303 British, all with the slower loadings of the time, it was notably superior. Ballistically, the .280 Ross cartridge's performance was broadly comparable to that of the more modern .280 Remington / 7 mm Express Remington and 7√ó64mm. It works well on all North American game when used with an appropriate bullet. Once the Ross rifle company went out of business after WW1, the cartridge was orphaned as no one else chambered rifles for it. As a commercially manufactured item this cartridge has been obsolete for some years, because of the inappropriate bullets often used in it originally, as well as problems associated with the Ross rifle that it was normally chambered in.\\"The .280 Ross Rifle, A Fast Shady Lady\\" by Erin Body at Chuck Hawks web site Handloaders continue to load successfully for it, by removing the belt from 7mm Remington Magnum or .300 Holland & Holland before resizing or by using swaged and necked-down .300 Remington Ultra Magnum cases.

After several other bands named \\"Higher Ground\\" surfaced, they held a name contest with Curto's entry, \\"Signal Zero\\", emerging as the eventual winner. With 4-part vocals and musical authority, Higher Ground toured across the state of Florida with powerhouse sets of classic and current rock, and was nominated \\"Best Circuit Band\\" in the 1994 Jammie Awards. Under Nat's management and promotion, Higher Ground also maintained a popular original project.

In addition to headlining several shows, they supported such acts as Foghat, Rick Derringer, Pat Travers, and Stranger. Higher Ground went on to record and shoot video at Full Sail Center for the Recording Arts in Orlando, Florida. In late 1995, they changed their name to \\"Signal Zero\\" (police code for \\"Armed, approach with caution!\\") and adopted a harder, more raunchy style.

These animals breathe through their skin and are largely terrestrial. Compared to other salamanders in Plethodon it is relatively stocky with long legs. Usually associated with streams, seepages, and rock outcrops, it is endemic to Washington where it is found in a limited number of small, isolated populations. Taxonomy Van Dyke's salamander was first described by John Van Denburgh in 1906 from a specimen found in Mount Rainier National Park. The species was named in honor of its collector, Edwin Cooper Van Dyke. The Coeur d'Alene salamander (Plethodon idahoensis) and the Larch Mountain salamander (Plethodon larselli) are its two closest relatives in the region. At one time, all three were thought to be members of the same species until genetic studies concluded that they were distinct species.Olson (2014)Frost (2016)  Description  Van Dyke's salamander has a relatively stocky body and grows up to 10 cm long. There are parotoid glands behind the eyes, and the feet are broad and slightly webbed. Different color phases are described based on body color, which can be black, yellow, or pink. The \\"dark phase\\" has a black ground color and yellow or red dorsal stripe. The stripe appears to have drops of color extending down the sides. The \\"light phase\\" is tan, yellow or rose with an indistinct stripe. Dark phase individuals have white speckling on the sides and a yellow throat. Multiple color phases can occur within the same population. They are completely terrestrial but require high soil moisture and cool temperatures. They are most active in the spring after snow-melt and in the fall after the onset of the rainy season. They avoid the summer heat and the freezing temperatures of winter, seeking shelter beneath stones or within rotting logs. Courtship and egg laying occurs in the spring. Clutch size ranges from 7-14 eggs which measure about 4‚Äì5 mm in diameter. Females attend the eggs until hatching in the fall. There is no larval stage; hatchlings emerge as juvenile salamanders. Distribution and habitat  Van Dyke's salamander is endemic to the western portion of Washington. It occurs in three disjunct areas: on the Olympic Peninsula, in the Willapa Hills, and in the southern Cascade Range. They generally occur in small isolated populations that are usually associated with streams, seepages, and rock outcrops. Van Dyke's Salamander is absent from the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range and Olympic Range, suggesting this salamander's association with high rainfall regions. In coastal areas, it is mostly found in old forest stands that have moderate to high levels of woody debris and fractured rock present. Large decaying conifer logs along streams appear to be important habitat for nesting.\\"Washington (2015) Conservation Threats to the Van Dyke's salamander are not well studied, but patchy distribution and low population densities would indicate that this species should receive conservation attention. Populations are at risk from logging, road construction, and other activities that could impact or degrade their specific habitat requirements. Surveys suggest that this species has limited ability to survive in disturbed habitat.AmphibiaWeb It occurs in two protected areas, Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and Olympic National Park.

Stourton matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1619 at the age of sixteen and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1623. He was ordained September 1625 and in 1627 received his MA. Stourton went to Newfoundland in 1627 as chaplain for the Sir George Calvert's colonists at Ferryland. Both he and Calvert did not see eye-to-eye on many things and was consequently banned from the colony in 1628 on Calvert's orders. Calvert calls him \\"an audacious man, a narrow-minded sectary, and a troublesome meddlesome busy-body\\". On his return to England, he had complained to the Privy Council to no avail. Stourton became chaplain to Christopher Villiers, Earl of Anglesey, and rector of Walesby in Lincolnshire from 1631 to 1658.

The road starts out at the light rail stop in historic Mt. Washington Village in Baltimore city as Smith Avenue, and continues through Pikesville up to Seven Mile Lane before its name changes to Slade Avenue, and the road widens to four lanes. The road is known as Slade Avenue until Reisterstown Road, and from there, its name becomes Milford Mill Road until it dead-ends one block south of Rolling Road in an area known as Windsor Mill. It is one of the most heavily used routes in the northwest suburbs of Baltimore, as it is used for cross-county travel by motorists between the Pikesville and Randallstown areas. History of the Road At one time, each road with its own name was a separate road, and they did not connect. A small section of Slade Avenue, which still independently exists today, ran from Seven Mile Lane parallel to Smith Avenue, then curved into Smith. This was prior to construction of the four-lane Slade Avenue that runs into Smith. At this time, Milford Mill Road was a separate road off Reisterstown Road in the Colonial Village area, and it began two blocks south of the intersection of Reisterstown and Slade. In 1987, in conjunction with the construction of the Milford Mill Metro Subway Station, parts of Milford Mill Road were relocated in order to provide better access to this station, and Slade/Milford Mill became a single road. A new overpass was constructed over the Western Maryland Railway where the Metro Subway would eventually run, and a new section was built that would merge into the old part of Slade Avenue. In order to make way for this new segment, several buildings of an apartment complex, then known as the Warren Park Apartments, and currently identified as the Milford Station Apartments, had to be demolished. A segment of the older portion of Milford Mill Road that runs parallel was renamed to Old Milford Mill Road, and a segment between the railroad and what eventually was named Roman Frasier Drive (current entrance road to the subway) was demolished, and the station was built on that land. An older segment of Slade west of Reisterstown Road, which was home to several houses, condos, and office buildings, was made into a turn off Milford Mill Road. In Mt. Washington, a separate stub of Smith Avenue exists that can be accessed from Falls Road. Prior to the construction of I-83, this was part of the longer Smith Avenue. The area around this stub is filled with much commercial development, including Meadowbrook Swim Club, which is well known as the location where Michael Phelps swims, and the now-defunct Northwest Ice Rink, that along with Meadowbrook, Phelps is rumored in a plan to purchase. Name Milford Mill Road is given its name from an old mill once located on the road,http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/realestate/bal-cp- milfordmill,0,313214.story?page=1 which dates back to 1728.http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/realestate/bal-cp- milfordmill,0,313214.story?page=2 Slade Avenue was named in honor of William A.

The best-known transit along this road is the Milford Mill Metro Subway Station in Pikesville. Construction on this station, which is used by hundreds of commuters each day, was completed in 1987. Between Park Heights Avenue and Liberty Road, Route 54 operates every 10‚Äì30 minutes. About half of these trips operate between Park Heights Avenue and the Metro station only. Route 52 reaches the intersection of Milford Mill and Liberty Roads, then loops using a single block of Milford Mill Road. Between Rolling Road and Liberty Road, Route 77 operates. This line runs between the Old Court Metro Subway Station and the Patapsco Light Rail Stop, traveling along the west side of Baltimore County. On Smith Avenue between Sanzo Road and Mt. Washington, bus service is available on Route 60. Route 58 also serves a portion of this section. In Mt. Washington, where Smith Avenue begins (and it is one way for the first block) is a stop on the Central Light Rail. Due to the small size of the streets in the area, buses do not actually enter the light rail station parking lot, and those wishing to transfer must walk a block.

Currently, the Jewish community of Antwerp consists of around 18,000.The Jewish Community of Antwerp, Belgium - The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot History Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, invited Rabbi Ya'aqov son of Rabbi Yequtiel, and thirty other Jews, to settle in Flanders in 1023. While it is not known precisely where they settled, this is considered to be the establishment of the Jewish community in the region. The first Jewish presence in Antwerp is attested to by the will of Henry III, the Duke of Brabant and Margrave of Antwerp, who in 1261 expressed his wish that the Jews of Brabant should be expelled and destroyed because they were all considered \\"usurers\\". In the mid-14th century, John III, the Duke of Brabant, conducted a massive anti-Jewish campaign in Brussels and Leuven and drove them from the city. A new group of Jewish immigrants started to settle in Antwerp in the early 16th century, when the city became a relatively safe haven for crypto-Jews fleeing the persecutions and the expulsions in the Iberian Peninsula. An often tenuous presence was maintained for the next century and a half, although Jews were not allowed to acquire citizenship and persecution was common. It was not until 1794 and with the arrival of the French Revolution that Jews could settle freely in Antwerp again. The current Jewish community of Antwerp was officially established in 1816, when there were about one hundred Jews living in the city. This, the first legally recognized community, was known as the Jewish Community (Communaut√© Israelite). The first Jewish public prayers were held in the private home of Moise Kreyn, having received the approval of the city authorities. The Jews of Antwerp acquired possession of a cemetery in 1828. There were 151 Jews living in Antwerp in 1829. During the Second World War, 65% of the city's Jews perished in the Holocaust (vs. only 35% of Jews from Brussels). On April 14, 1941, the so-called \\"Antwerp pogrom\\" occurred when some 200 followers of the Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (\\"Flemish National Union\\"), Volksverwering (\\"People's Defense\\"), Anti-Jewish League and other pro-Nazi anti-Semitic groups burned two synagogues in the Oosten straat, smashed the windows of Jewish-owned shops, damaged religious symbols and harassed the Jewish population. In May‚ÄìSeptember 1942, some 1500 Jewish men from Antwerp were taken into forced labor in Northern France, building the \\"Atlantic Wall\\" for the Organisation Todt. From the end of July until November 1942, on three occasions, Jews in Antwerp were rounded up by the Germans with the collaboration of the local police. From a community of around 35,000 Jews in Antwerp before the war, some 15,000 remained in the city after 1945. Present The Jewish community of Antwerp consists of around 18,000 members. The majority of residents identifying themselves as Jewish belong to traditional or Orthodox communities, although levels of religious practice vary. The Haredi, or ultra-orthodox Jews, traditionally tend to live concentrated in the city center in an area close to the Antwerp Central railway station. This neighborhood is also sometimes known as \\"Jewish Antwerp\\" (). Its main attraction is its close proximity to the diamond bourse, where in earlier days a large part of the community worked. It is also where the Jewish schools, kosher food outlets, and general Jewish amenities are located. In recent years many of the younger generation of secular Jews have moved away from the crowded city center. There has also been small but steady growth of Orthodox satellite communities in suburbs such as Edegem, Wilrijk and Brasschaat. This may cause the Antwerp community to seem overwhelmingly Haredi to the casual observer. After New York City, London and Paris, Antwerp is one of the largest communities of Haredi Jews outside Israel. Within the prominently-ashkenazi religious community there are two religious councils, known as kehillas; and a small sefardi council: * The Isra√´litische Gemeente van Antwerpen Shomre Hadass; primarily oriented toward the Modern Orthodox community. It is led by Chief Rabbi David Moshe Lieberman. This council also espouses the values of religious Zionism and maintains a pro-Israel stance in community affairs. * The Orthodox Isra√´litische Gemeente Machsike Hadass primarily oriented toward the ultra-orthodox Haredi community. * The \\"Portuguees Isra√´litische Gemeenschap van Antwerpen\\" is the Sefardi religious community. The late Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, was the Chief Rabbi of the Machzikei Hadass kehilla for many years and was widely regarded as a pre- eminent scholar of Talmud. He died in 2001 and was replaced by Rabbi Rubinstein of Israel, who died a few months after being nominated to the post. Since December 2010, the position has been filled by Rabbi Aaron Schiff. Rabbi Schiff, a follower of the current Grand Rabbi of Belz (Hasidic dynasty), Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, is an alumnus of the Erlau yeshiva in Jerusalem and was previously the Rabbi of the local Alexander synagogue. An essential difference between these two organizations is apparent in the Shomrei Hadas' alignment with religious Zionist doctrine, which the Machzikei Hadass rejects. Hasidic Jews Hasidic Jews comprise about forty percent of the Jews of Antwerp. Hasidic movements represented in Antwerp include: *Alexander (located in the Isabellalei) *Belz (the big one on Van Spangenstr-Media plein, and the new shtiebel at Lange Leemstr.) *Bobov *Belz-Machnovka (located in the Van Leriusstraat) *Chortkov (located in the Van Leriusstraat) *Ger *Lubavitch is located on the Brialmontlei. A splinter group of Messianic Lubavitchers meets in the Oostenstraat. *Pshevorsk (located in the Mercatorstraat) *Satmar *Shotz *Skver *Sanz-Klausenberg (located in the Isabellalei) *Vizhnitz (Vizhnitz Bnei Brak, Vizhnitz New York) The Pshevorsk movement is the only internationally recognized Hasidic movement based in Antwerp. The Pshevorsker Rebbe, Rabbi Leibish Leiser, lives in Antwerp, as did his predecessors. Pshevorsker Hasidim live mainly in Antwerp, London, and Manchester; on Jewish holidays, many come to Antwerp to see their rebbe. There are also other Hasidic rebbes in Antwerp, including a Spinka Rebbe and a Zhemigrader Rebbe. These groups have rebbes in other locations as well. Non-Hasidic Jews Although the Jews not aligned to any Hasidic group probably no longer greatly outnumber the Hasidim, they have a substantial presence. The three major synagogues in Antwerp, known locally by their addresses, The Van Den Nestlei and the Bouwmeesterstraat (pictured above) shuls of the Shomre Hadass and the Oostenstraat shul, are not aligned to any Hasidic movement. There is a small Lithuanian Jewish community. Furthermore, there are organizations of Georgian Jews, a Sephardic synagogue, and secular Jewish organizations. Eruv As in other cities with large Jewish communities, Antwerp is surrounded by a wire called \\"eruv\\" (Eiroew in Dutch). In contrast to the eruvs in New York City or other large cities, the Antwerp eruv surrounds the whole city center. The presence of this eruv allows Jews to interpret the city as one big house, making it easier to avoid breaking some Sabbath regulations within it. The wire constituting the eruv can be found close to the Singel at a height of 6 meters, and at the entrance of the Diamond district.Antwerp's Eruv/ Antwerp Retrieved 25 January 2013. Schools A number of Jewish schools are found throughout the Jewish district (95% of the Jewish children of Antwerp receive a religious education). The three main Jewish schools in Antwerp are the Yesode Hatora of the Machsike Hadas, and the Yavne and Tachkemoni schools of the Shomre Hadas. The Yesode Hatora - Beth Jacob population is composed primarily of students from Hasidic, Haredi, and Orthodox backgrounds. It provides instruction in religious as well as secular studies: Students follow a dual curriculum starting in pre-school/kindergarten, through primary school and secondary school. Established in 1903, it is the oldest of Antwerp's Jewish schools, and has the highest population of Jewish students. Students are educated in accordance with the values of Haredi Judaism, and fulfill the educational requirements of the Belgian Ministry of Education. The student population is separated by gender; male students attend Yesode Hatora, and female students attend Beth Jacob. In accordance with the religious ideology that puts little value on secular learning, the school actively discourages the pursuit of secular higher education. The Yavne school is aligned with the religious Zionist movement. Similar to Yesode Hatora/Beth Jacob, the Yavne school follows a dual curriculum composed of religious and secular studies. Students are educated in accordance with the values of religious Zionism, and fulfill the educational requirements of the Belgian Ministry of Education. The school is not mixed; male students attend the Yeshiva Tichonit and females the Ulpena Lebanot. An estimated 98% of Yavne students typically emigrate to Israel (commonly referred to in Jewish communities as \\"making aliyah\\") within one year of graduation from secondary school. In recent years, far-reaching improvements have been achieved in the secular curriculum. Religious instruction also adheres to high standards and a widely developed curriculum. The Tachkemoni is a fully co-educational school, attracting students from primarily secular Jewish backgrounds and some modern-Orthodox families. Its high level of Hebrew and serious preparation for the Jerusalem Examination (Bechina Yerushalmit) administered by the Jewish Agency and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem makes it one of the finest Jewish educational institutions in Europe. Most graduates pursue university studies after completing secondary school, and many spend a year in Israel. Tachkemoni was founded in 1920 by Rabbi Moshe Avigdor Amiel, a moderate religious Zionist. His vision of a strong Jewish education, along with a good secular education, is still part of the culture of Tachkemoni. In addition, there are several kollelim, where married men can continue their studies. The famed Haredi Etz Chaim Yeshiva, where hundreds of young men from around the world study, is now located in the Wilrijk district, having previously been in the Antwerp suburban towns, first of Heide, then Kapellen. Many synagogues, schools, charities, and social groups care for the environment. A majority of Jews living in Antwerp are multi-lingual and communicate in a variety of languages. Yiddish, French, Hebrew, English, and German are all widely spoken among members of the community, as well as Dutch. The Jewish community of Antwerp did not immediately adopt the locally spoken Dutch language as their common spoken language. Instead, in line with the people they worked with in the diamond trade, they spoke French, the language of commerce in Antwerp until after World War II. In recent years, English has taken over as the common language of choice, while stricter enforcement of local language regulations ensure that all children are fluent in Dutch. The use of language in Antwerp's Jewish community is a complex issue: While community members possess fair knowledge of different languages, there is a lack of uniformity when it comes to effective communication and discussion in a common language. Demographics The Jewish community in Antwerp has maintained a strong and active presence in the local diamond trade. After World War II, Belgian Jewish survivors as well as others from Eastern Europe settled in Antwerp and built up an influential and highly successful stake in the diamond business. Whether through established diamond trading offices, cutting and polishing factories, or as diamond brokers, Antwerp's Jews established themselves as capable businessmen and -women. Over the course of the past decade, however, much of the wholesale diamond trade has been taken over by the Jain Indian community. With easy access to manufacturing centers in India, where production costs are significantly cheaper, the Jewish community has lost some of its influence as far as the diamond trade is concerned. However, the diamond business remains a common profession shared by most of the members of the Jewish community. The future of Antwerp's Jewish community is uncertain, with a record number of Jews opting for residence in Israel and to a lesser extent in the United States and the United Kingdom. Community publications *Joods Actueel is a family-owned and operated monthly magazine led by General Director Terry Davids and Managing Editor Michael Zevi Freilich. *Kehilatenu, published weekly by the Shomre Hadass, in Dutch, contains sections on the portion of the week, including community news. *Shabbat b'Shabbato, published weekly by the Machzikei Hadass, in Hebrew and Yiddish. It is commonly perused by synagogue attendants at Sabbath services. *Lema'an Teida, a Yiddish weekly e-newsletter written by Pinchas Kornfeld, consists primarily of editorial content. Dining and restaurants There are a variety of kosher restaurants located in and around Antwerp's Jewish area, including a vegetarian kosher restaurant called Beni Falafel, a dairy restaurant called Mama Mia, a pizzeria called Time Out, a kosher steakhouse called Lama Lo, a kosher Chinese restaurant Blue Lagoon. Rivi's and Hoffys. Antisemitism in the 21st Century During November 2013 alone, six anti-semitic incidents were recorded throughout Antwerp. These include the chasing of Jewish children and the attack of an old Jewish woman. All the incidents were committed by men of Middle Eastern or North African descent.

The company manufactures a host of different products including ductile iron pipe and fittings, cast iron soil pipe and fittings, heavy duty couplings, utility poles, network switches and monitoring equipment, and related products. McWane is also a manufacturer of pressurized cylinders for the storage of propane and other gases through its Manchester Tank and Equipment Company division, and fire protection systems and extinguishers through its Amerex subsidiary. Based in Birmingham, Alabama, McWane is a family owned company employing more than 6,900 team members in over 25 manufacturing locations worldwide. In addition to the United States, the company has international operations in Australia, Canada, Chile, China, South Korea, India, Norway and the United Arab Emirates. Its products are used in Afghanistan, India and across Asia and the Pacific, throughout Europe, South America and nearly everywhere in North America. Its operating revenues are estimated at approximately $1.5 to 2 billion .  History  J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions. In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, \\"The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense.\\" His vision is referred to within the company as \\"The McWane Way\\", and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial loss. In 2006, McWane's Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant, Clow Valve Company in Oskaloosa, Iowa, was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA. Growth and expansion = Domestic acquisitions = The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H; Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers. In 2008, McWane Poles developed a new product for the electric utility industry that is used by companies including the Florida Key Electric Cooperative. Then, in 2012, McWane entered into the technology industry by adding Synapse Wireless and Nighthawk, a provider for wireless smart grid solutions. =International expansion= McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto, Ontario. After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.Clow Canada Limited, Company history. Accessed 21 July 2014. Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company. In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile. Additionally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway. In 2012, McWane moved into the technology space by adding ComTech Korea, based in Seoul, and Ontario-based Futurecom, and added UK-based Zinwave in 2014. Their most recent expansion internationally came in 2015, when it opened its first manufacturing plant in Abu Dhabi, called McWane Gulf. = China = In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane's petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation. Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the \\"Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006\\" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.  Environmental and safety issues  Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations. In 2002, The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations leading to fines and criminal convictions.PBS Frontline, \\"A Dangerous Business,\\" https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/workplace/mcwane/ In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003. =Criminal and civil violations= Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane's safety and environmental practices. Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.Mcwane agrees to resolve environmental violations, US Justice Dept press release, 14 July 2010 accessed 17 July 2010, http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/July/10-ag-802.html Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants. This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts. McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was \\"the beginning of the final chapter\\" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.Associated Press, Alabama pipemaker mcwane in $13 m pact with epa, 15 July 2010. Retrieved 17 July 2010, http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/15/ap/business/main6681130.shtml PBS Frontline aired an updated version of \\"A Dangerous Business\\", entitled \\"A Dangerous Business Revisited\\", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.PBS Frontline documentary about McWane =Commitment to safety and environment= Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page. Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999. In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems. It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities. McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns. =Independent review and recognition= In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management \\"has shown a dramatic change in attitude\\" and that \\"current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors.\\" During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, \\"A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone.\\" As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations. The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality's Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce's \\"Business of the Year\\" award in 2007. In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. , seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.  Philanthropy  Vulcan statue at the center of Vulcan Park, Birmingham, Alabama. The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham's famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane's foundry and is the largest cast iron statue in the world. The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs. In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama's Children's Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital. Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources, including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company. In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.

One of the few Jacobites excluded from the 1747 Act of Indemnity, his attempts to return home were unsuccessful and he spent the rest of his life in France and Switzerland. His wife Sofia (1756‚Äì1777) died in childbirth; Elcho left no legitimate children and when he died in Paris in 1787, his property passed to a younger brother. His record of the 1745 Rising or A short account of the affairs of Scotland in the years 1744, 1745, 1746, is now considered a key contemporary source for the Rising. Biographical details Elcho Castle, Perth, now managed by Historic Environment Scotland David Wemyss, Lord Elcho was born on 21 August 1721 at Wemyss Castle in Fife, eldest son of James Wemyss, 5th Earl of Wemyss and Janet Charteris (died 1778). His title derived from Elcho Castle; abandoned in the 1730s but restored in the 19th century, it is one of the earliest examples of a Scottish building preserved purely for its historical value. His mother was the only child of Francis Charteris, who became immensely wealthy through his investment in the South Sea Company. A well- known rake, he appears in Hogarth's series A Harlot's Progress, and sentenced to death for rape in 1730 before being pardoned. Elcho had two younger brothers, Francis (1723-1808) and James (1726‚Äì1786). His sister Frances (ca 1729-1789) married Sir James Steuart (1707‚Äì1780), exiled for his part in the 1745 Rising but allowed home in 1763. He was the author of An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy, described as 'one of the key economic works of the 18th century'. In September 1776, Elcho married Sofia (1756‚Äì1777), daughter of Reichsgraf Friedrich von √úxk√ºll-Gyllenband, who died in childbirth a year later. He left two illegitimate daughters but no legitimate heir and his property passed to his younger brother. He died in 1787 in Paris, where he was buried and his memorial destroyed in the French Revolution. Career Winchester College, which Elcho attended from 1734 to 1738 Like many Jacobite sympathisers, Elcho had a background of Non-Juring Episcopalianism, Freemasonry and opposition to the 1707 Union; like the Jacobite peer Earl Kilmarnock, his father was Grand Master of Scotland, as was his brother Francis. However, the family were not considered activists and had not been involved in previous Risings. After his parents separated in 1732, he was sent to Winchester College in England, three weeks journey from his home in Fife; Elcho later recorded he met his father only once between 1734 and 1741. One of his classmates was James, later 6th Duke of Hamilton, whose father claimed to be the senior Scottish Jacobite. A biographer claimed Winchester turned Elcho into a fervent Scots patriot and that he 'disliked all Irishmen, most Englishmen, and a good many Scots.' During the Rising, he allegedly referred to Prince Charles as 'that damned, cowardly Italian', although this is disputed. Elcho left Winchester in 1738 for Reims, followed by a period at the French military academy in Angers, a popular location for young British noblemen. He then went on the 18th century cultural excursion known as the Grand Tour and visited Rome in October 1740, one of whose attractions was the exiled James Stuart and his sons. After the failed 1719 Rising, many Jacobite exiles accepted pardons and returned home, among them Lord George Murray. By 1737, Jacobitism seemed little more than nostalgia and James was reportedly \\"living tranquilly in Rome, having abandoned all hope of a restoration.\\" =Jacobite activist 1740 to 1746= The Old Pretender James Stuart; painted ca 1741, when Elcho first met him This changed in the late 1730s, as French statesmen sought to reduce British commercial strength, whose growth was considered a threat to the European balance of power. Few of them believed the Stuart exiles were a valid option, but Elcho arrived in Rome when they were being taken seriously for the first time in two decades. In 1739, trade disputes between Britain and Spain led to the War of Jenkins' Ear, followed by the wider European conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. French defeat at Dettingen in June 1743 prompted efforts by Louis XV to divert British resources from mainland Europe, including an invasion of England in early 1744 to restore the Stuarts. James gave Elcho a commission as Colonel of dragoons, but the French fleet was severely damaged by winter storms in March and the plan was abandoned. Elcho returned to Edinburgh in December 1744, where he joined the Freemasons and the newly-formed pro- Jacobite Buck Club, whose members included his former Winchester classmate James Hamilton. Another was Murray of Broughton, whom Charles met in Paris earlier in the year, and shared his determination to come to Scotland \\"though with a single footman\\". The Club urged him not to do so, unless he brought 6,000 French troops, money and weapons; Charles Stewart, 5th Earl of Traquair (1699‚Äì1764), agreed to communicate this to the Prince but failed to do so. Jacobite officer Lord George Murray; at their first meeting, Charles told Elcho his loyalty was suspect When Charles landed at Eriskay on 23 July, Elcho's first reaction was to 'implore him to return to France', and he stayed at home awaiting developments. Charles persuaded Lochiel and others to back him and launched the Rebellion at Glenfinnan on 19 August. His small force of 1,000 clansmen advanced on Edinburgh, reaching Perth on 4 September, where they were joined by Lord George Murray. Elcho met them outside Edinburgh on 16 September, bringing ¬£1,500 in cash, which was gratefully received by Charles. Elcho was appointed aide-de-camp and a member of the Council of War; made up of 15-20 senior leaders, it was dominated by the Highland chiefs and Perthshire lords who provided most of their manpower. Divisions within the Jacobite leadership were apparent even at this early stage, Charles warning him against Lord George Murray, whom he claimed had joined only to 'better betray the cause.' Elcho raised a troop of 'Lifeguards,' the best equipped cavalry unit in the Jacobite Army, who served as Charles' personal escort throughout the campaign. However, the decision to retreat from Derby on 5 December caused an irrevocable breach between the Prince and his Scottish supporters, including Elcho. At Culloden in April 1746, the Lifeguards escorted Charles from the battlefield, who then dismissed them, as he now trusted only the Irish exiles. On 3 May, Elcho, Lord George Murray and other Jacobites were picked up by two French ships, Le Mars and Bellone, who fought their way out past four Royal Navy vessels. Charles was left behind 'as Nobody knew where to seek for him.' =Post 1746 Exile= Prince Charles as on old man Charles escaped from Scotland in October but the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 ended French support for the Stuart cause, while the Scots no longer trusted him. Elcho lost his titles and lands; the attainder was not reversed until 1821, when Francis Douglas (1772-1853) became 8th Earl of Wemyss. He was excluded from the 1747 Act of Indemnity, allegedly because 'among all the Rebel commanders, he distinguished himself by his brutality and insults and cruelty to our Prisoners.' Like Lord George Murray, he spent the rest of his life in exile, despite pleas to be allowed home. In June 1747, he wrote to Lord Milton, the Lord Justice Clerk of Scotland that 'if his Majesty will allow me to come home, I will give any assurance whatever for my making his Majesty a most loyall subject for the future'. The former Jacobite leaders argued bitterly over responsibility for the Rising's failure, and Charles refused to reimburse Elcho for the money advanced at Edinburgh in 1745. He was appointed Captain in Fitzjames's regiment, then Colonel in the Royal-Ecossais after its commander John Drummond died in September 1747. The regiment garrisoned Gravelines and Dunkirk during the 1756 to 1763 Seven Years' War and in July 1770, Louis XV gave him the Order of Military Merit. Elcho divided his time between France and Switzerland, where he bought a property in the Canton of Neuch√¢tel and became a Swiss citizen. In 1770 he did a marriage proposal to Isabelle de Charri√®re when he was baron at Cottendart. She had however already decided to marry another man of the same village Colombier, Neuch√¢tel. On 9 September 1776, he married Sofia von √úxk√ºll-Gyllenband (1756‚Äì1777), at Beutal in Switzerland, daughter of Reichsgraf Friedrich von √úxk√ºll-Gyllenband, a minister of the Duchy of Wurttemberg. She died in B√¥le, Switzerland on 26 November 1777, giving birth to a son who lived only one day; Elcho \\"...died in Paris on April 30, 1787 at his home in the Rue St Lazard.\\" Despite his request to be buried with his wife, he was interred in Paris and the cemetery destroyed during the French Revolution. He left two manuscripts, a journal in French, covering the principal years of his life and \\"A Short Account of the Affairs of Scotland, 1745-1746;\\" edited by Evan Charteris, this was first published in 1907.

Several Tupamaros participate in peaceful movements while some believe the \\"idea of armed struggle as a means to gain power.\\" The group supports the National Liberation Army (ELN) and allegedly had ties with FARC. History After the end of the dictatorship of General Marcos Perez Jimenez, the Caracas area known as \\"el 23 de Enero\\" that was occupied by his wealthy officials was then taken over by poor squatters. Since then, the area has been described as a \\"hot bed of radicalism\\" and that residents have \\"a resistance mentality\\". When the Tupamaro in Uruguay were being targeted by the Uruguayan government, some of the Uruguayan members supposedly settled \\"el 23 de Enero\\". The Venezuelan Tupamaros have at least ideological links to the Tupamaros in Uruguay that took the name of Tupac Amaru, the last Incan leader of Peru who was executed by Spanish authorities in 1572 for opposing colonial rule. In the 1970s and 1980s, then future members of the Tupamaros were allegedly gaining experience by partaking in guerrilla activities and performing vigilante actions during a period of rising crime in Venezuela. =Founding= Tupamaros political art showing support for Hugo Ch√°vez. The Tupamaros were officially founded in 1992 and allegedly had the chance in prison to come into contact with Hugo Ch√°vez, who was imprisoned for the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempts. Ch√°vez and the Tupamaros then allegedly made a deal since Ch√°vez needed protection and the Tupamaros needed resources. With emergence of Hugo Ch√°vez as President of Venezuela consolidated its disparities in support of the then new Movement for the Fifth Republic president. Nevertheless, throughout their existence, the ideological basis of the movement began to deteriorate. As it stood in the first decade of the twenty-first century denunciations of the group from many forces in the country, with respect to the conduct of this group and its members, was ever present, specifically because of alleged attacks on student movements that are not in agreement with Hugo Ch√°vez. Leadership The original leader of the Tupamaros was Jose Pinto, who was the General Secretary of the MRT. Alberto \\"Chino\\" Car√≠as is the current leader of the Tupamaros and calls himself \\"a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla fighter\\". He states that he keeps contact with Carlos the Jackal and \\"has lost count of how many people he's murdered\\", saying \\"after ten [murders] you stop feeling remorse\\". Social work With the emergence of Chavez as president, the group also cooperated with the state in administering social programs and promoting political participation. It is involved in after-school programs to keep children out of trouble, child care centers, puppet shows, drug rehabilitation and sports programs. A Tupamaro leader known as Chino, said of the group that \\"Our greatest accomplishment is having been able to change things through elections.\\" According to Dr. George W. Knox, executive director of the National Gang Crime Research Center, the Tupamaros are a \\"gang\\" and that they use claims like \\"helping the oppressed peoples\\" as a ploy that he describes as similar \\"to Al Capone offering free soup to Chicago's poor\\". Neighborhood actions The group has refused to renounce use of arms to protect communities considered too dangerous even for police officers. In one such example in the high-crime 23 de Enero neighborhood in western Caracas, thieves, muggers or drug dealers who operate in the area run the risk of being executed by Tupamaros patrolling on motorcycles in death squads. A Tupamaro member known as \\"Mao\\" insisted neighbourhood criminals are given ample warning before facing execution. \\"First we give them a warning to get out of the area. If they don't listen, we see them again, this time with 10 of our comrades. If they fail to understand the message, we take matters into our own hands.\\" Though, once again the masks they wear are said to ward off possible retribution from criminals, police or Chavez's political opposition, but they also reinforce an imposing image that critics call a tool of intimidation against Chavez's political opposition. Some have claimed that the Tupamaros execute such criminals because they are competition and they want to have control. Political violence Luis Milan, a political science professor at Bolivarian University talked about a riot that began when police opened fire. With the arrival of more Tupamaros to the aid their comrades police, then, asked for military support, signifying the growing potency of the group. He added that \\"They are becoming a legitimate party, they are participating in the political process. It's a different time now.\\" =Court decisions= On 8 August 2002, four military officers were being tried for rebellion following the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt and the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) delayed the trial of the officers since judges could not agree on judgements. Following this, President Ch√°vez gave a strong speech on Margarita Island in a \\"pre-April 11 fashion\\" calling for supporters to defend \\"to be ready, at all moments, to defend the Revolution against anyone\\" while also making statements on not putting pressure on the TSJ judgements. Tupamaros then allegedly attacked a police convoy with high-caliber weapons in a slum area which left one officer dead, one injured and an additional four civilian casualties. Ch√°vez supporters also began to protest in Caracas, closing the street in front of the TSJ and burning tires and another four police officers were reported injured. Tupamaros had also reportedly blocked streets and subways and began to throw Molotov cocktails at police vehicles. =Elections= Ismach Leon, a campaign manager for the opposition party First Justice said, \\"The Tupamaros began following me to get me out of Coche (a Caracas slum) because I was campaigning for (conservative candidate) Julio Borges.\\" Near the conclusion of the 2012 Venezuelan presidential election, Tupamaros leader Alberto Car√≠as stated that if the Venezuelan opposition did not accept a \\"sure victory\\" by Hugo Ch√°vez, \\"that there would 'bullets'\\". He also stated that the group was \\"prepared and well armed\\" and would attack any opposition group that protested. =Foreign diplomats= In April 2006 following an event where United States Ambassador William Brownfield donated baseball equipment to a poor community in Caracas, Brownfield's convoy was hit, kicked and pelted with objects. The convoy was allegedly attack organized by the Tupamaros with some shouts supposedly heard at the time involving the word \\"Tupamaros\\". =Protests= It was alleged that during the 2014‚Äì15 Venezuelan protests, Tupamaros worked with the Venezuelan National Guard to attack protesters that opposed the Bolivarian government.

Allen (1868‚Äì1958) was an architect known for designing buildings on Long Island and in New York City, as well as New Jersey. He also designed the office of American financier and railroad executive John W. Campbell at Grand Central Terminal, which was later converted into a bar called the Campbell Apartment. Long Island Allen designed many grand estates on Long Island for wealthy families from New York. He also designed other buildings on the island, including Sag Harbor's library. =John Jermain Memorial Library= Allen designed the John Jermain Memorial Library in Sag Harbor, built in 1910 with funds donated by Mrs. Russell Sage in memory of her grandfather, Major John Jermain, and presented as a gift to the people of Sag Harbor. The property, located directly across Main Street from Mrs. Sage's then summer home, cost $10,000, at the time the highest price ever paid for a piece of real estate in Sag Harbor. Construction of the building cost $70,000. Allen designed the library in the Classical revival style. Four stone Doric columns supporting a pediment adorn the front of the by brick structure. The trim and base of the building are done in stone. The stone lintels of the windows are designed with the Greek key pattern. Other architectural details include wreaths, torches and egg and dart molding. In the interior, fluted stone columns, and lintels ornamented with medallions form the octagonal third floor reading room. Bronze torches light the entryways and vestibules. A winding marble staircase leads up to this room that is crowned by a brick, copper and stained glass dome rising above the ground. The dome, constructed by the R. Guastavino Company, is one of the more than 1,000 they built, including those at the library of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, and the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. A brief history of the John Jermain Memorial Library official site New Jersey =Pleasantdale Chateau= Charles W. Nichols of Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation, later AlliedSignal, acquired a number of contiguous farms in 1912 and created a estate with formal gardens in West Orange, New Jersey. The Nichols family used the property as a summer weekend retreat and occupied a small farmhouse. But after a number of years, the family desired a larger home. In the 1920s, Nichols set out to build his country estate, preferring the Norman style of architecture from the south of England and the north of France. He hired Allen as his architect and the two toured Europe to seek out Norman style buildings and designed Pleasantdale Chateau. The exterior of the house is of the Norman half-timber and stucco character, while the interior reflects a number of period styles. The entrance has 15th century Spanish tiles on the floor. The chateau was completed in 1933. Pleasantdale Chateau stands today at 757 Eagle Rock Avenue as an example of a French Normandy manor house, and serves as a retreat, catering and conference facility.A History of Pleasantdale Chateau www.pleasantdale.com New York City =Office of John W. Campbell= In 1923, Campbell leased of space in Grand Central from Cornelius Vanderbilt for his office. It was a single room long by wide with a ceiling and an enormous fireplace. Campbell commissioned Allen, to design his office, transforming the space into a 13th-century Florentine palace with a hand-painted timbered ceiling and leaded windows. He installed 19th-century Italian chairs and tables, an art collection worth more than $1 million, and a massive desk from which he conducted business. After Campbell‚Äôs death in 1957, the office fell into disrepair. Many years later, in 1999, the space was restored and renovated into a public bar and lounge called the Campbell Apartment. The name is apparently a misnomer, people having assumed that such a grand space was an apartment, not an office. The walls and ceiling were brought back to their former glory at a cost of $1.5 million. =1082 Park Avenue= Allen designed this bright, polychromed tile facade in 1925 for a furniture and decoration company that played an unusual part in the development of this section of Park Avenue. The original 1082 Park Avenue was one of a row of eight five-story brick apartment houses covering the entire west side of Park Avenue from 88th to 89th Street. In 1905, Simon Ginsberg, an upholsterer with a shop across the street, bought 1082 Park and relocated to the ground floor. In 1924, a syndicate developing the co-op apartment house built as 1088 Park Avenue, at the southwest corner of 89th Street, acquired an L-shaped plot surrounding 1082 Park and the corner building, 1080. In 1925, as the new 1088 Park Avenue apartment house was rising, Ginsberg decided on a new look for his building, too. Allen, a veteran rowhouse designer, developed a complicated facade of glazed terra cotta: a ground floor of rusticated blocks, second floor of show windows separated by spiral colonettes, third and fourth floors joined behind double height panels and an attic story of rounded windows under a tiled, projecting roof. As rebuilt by the upholsterer, 1082 had a band of lettering reading \\"Ginsberg\\" at the attic-floor level and another reading \\"Furniture & Decoration\\" at the third-floor level. The zoning law of 1916 established this section of Park Avenue as strictly residential, and permitted Ginsberg to rebuild only because the store was already there. By 1935, the Ginsbergs were succeeded as the ground floor tenant by an A&P.; The ground floor is now occupied by the Dutch Girl dry cleaning store. The Ginsbergs retained their furniture business upstairs for a while, but by the 1940s the upper floors were used for doctors' and dentists' offices, and they are now apartments. =292 Madison Avenue= The original twelve story building at the corner of Madison Avenue and 41st Street was designed by Allen in 1910. It was expanded upwards to 26 stories and to the sides by Ludlow & Peabody in 1923. Today, the building is home to many law firms, as well as the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation and the Park Avenue Liquor Shop, which dates back to 1934. =Latham Hotel= Latham Hotel Allen designed the Latham Hotel, a 13-story building on East 28th Street, in 1906. It is now a budget hotel, but is ideally located for tourists, near the Empire State Building and convenient to Penn Station and Grand Central. The building is also home to Latham Properties, a full-service real estate firm in existence since 1979 that was active in purchasing hotels in Manhattan and South Beach in the mid 1980s and early 1990s. It still owns and manages a broad portfolio of properties in the New York and Miami metro areas.

Sitting by designation, in his concurrence in Kruse v. City of Cincinnati, Cohn wrote: \\"The Supreme Court's decision in Buckley, however, is not a broad pronouncement declaring all campaign expenditure limits unconstitutional. It may be possible to develop a factual record to establish that the interest in freeing officeholders from the pressures of fundraising so they can perform their duties, or the interest in preserving faith in our democracy, is compelling, and that campaign expenditure limits are a narrowly tailored means of serving such an interest.\\" Cohn issued an injunction in PAACAR v.

In order to make the biarc smooth (G1 continuous), the two arcs should have the same tangent at the connecting point where they meet. Biarcs are commonly used in geometric modeling and computer graphics. They can be used to approximate splines and other plane curves by placing the two outer endpoints of the biarc along the curve to be approximated, with a tangent that matches the curve, and then choosing a middle point that best fits the curve. This choice of three points and two tangents determines a unique pair of circular arcs, and the locus of middle points for which these two arcs form a biarc is itself a circular arc. In particular, to approximate a B√©zier curve in this way, the middle point of the biarc should be chosen as the incenter of the triangle formed by the two endpoints of the B√©zier curve and the point where their two tangents meet. More generally, one can approximate a curve by a smooth sequence of biarcs; using more biarcs in the sequence will in general improve the approximation's closeness to the original curve.  Examples of biarc curves  1. In the below examples biarcs A(J)B are subtended by the chord AB, and J is the join point. Tangent vector at the start point A is \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\alpha), and \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\beta) is the tangent at the end point B: : \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\alpha)=\\\\cos\\\\alpha,\\\\,\\\\sin\\\\alpha^T,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\beta)=\\\\cos\\\\beta,\\\\,\\\\sin\\\\beta^T.\\\\qquad(1) 2. Fig. 2 shows six examples of biarcs AJB. * Biarc 1 is drawn with \\\\alpha=100^\\\\circ,\\\\;\\\\beta=30^\\\\circ. Biarcs 2-6 have \\\\alpha=100^\\\\circ,\\\\;\\\\beta=-30^\\\\circ. * In examples 1, 2, 6 curvature changes sign, and the join point J is also the inflection point. Biarc 3 includes the straight line segment JB. * Biarcs 1‚Äì4 are short in the sense that they do not turn near endpoints. Alternatively, biarcs 5,6 are long: turning near one of endpoints means that they intersect the left or the right complement of the chord to the infinite straight line. * Biarcs 2‚Äì6 share end tangents. They can be found in the lower fragment of Fig. 3, among the family of biarcs with common tangents. 3. Fig. 3 shows two examples of biarc families, sharing end points and end tangents. 4. Fig. 4 shows two examples of biarc families, sharing end points and end tangents, end tangents being parallel: \\\\alpha=\\\\beta. 5. Fig. 5 shows specific families with either \\\\alpha=\\\\pi or \\\\beta=\\\\pi. {align=\\"left\\" -valign=\\"bottom\\" Fig. 2. Examples of biarcs Fig. 3. Biarcs families with common tangents (two examples) Fig. 4. Biarcs families with parallel end tangents } =\\\\pi Different colours in figures 3, 4, 5 are explained below as subfamilies \\\\color{sienna}\\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,+}, \\\\color{blue}\\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_1, \\\\color{green}\\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_2. In particular, for biarcs, shown in brown on shaded background (lens-like or lune-like), the following holds: * the total rotation (turning angle) of the curve is exactly \\\\beta-\\\\alpha (not \\\\beta-\\\\alpha\\\\pm 2\\\\pi, which is the rotation for other biarcs); * \\\\sgn(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)=\\\\sgn(k_2-k_1): the sum \\\\alpha+\\\\beta is the angular width of the lens/lune, covering the biarc, whose sign corresponds to either increasing (+1) or decreasing curvature (-1) of the biarc, according to generalized Vogt's theorem (ru).  Family of biarcs with common end tangents  A family of biarcs with common end points A=(-c,0), B=(c,0), and common end tangents (1) is denoted as \\\\mathcal{B}(p;\\\\,\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,c), or, briefly, as \\\\mathcal{B}(p), p being the family parameter. Biarc properties are described below in terms of article. 1. Constructing of a biarc is possible if : -\\\\pi\\\\leqslant\\\\alpha\\\\leqslant\\\\pi,\\\\quad -\\\\pi\\\\leqslant\\\\beta\\\\leqslant\\\\pi,\\\\qquad 0<\\\\alpha+\\\\beta<2\\\\pi.\\\\qquad\\\\qquad(2) 2. Denote * k_1, \\\\theta_1 and L_1 the curvature, the turning angle and the length of the arc AJ: \\\\theta_1=k_1L_1; * k_2, \\\\theta_2 and L_2 the same for the arc JB: \\\\theta_2=k_2L_2. Then : k_1(p)=-\\\\frac1c\\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\alpha+p^{-1}\\\\sin\\\\omega\\\\right),\\\\quad k_2(p)=\\\\frac1c\\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\beta+p\\\\sin\\\\omega\\\\right),\\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad \\\\omega=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}2 (due to (2), \\\\sin\\\\omega ot=0). Turning angles: : \\\\theta_1(p)=2\\\\arg\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\alpha} +p^{-1}{\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\omega}}\\\\right),\\\\quad \\\\theta_2(p)=2\\\\arg\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{e}^{ \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\beta } +p\\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\omega}\\\\right). 3. The locus of join points J is the circle : X_J(p)=\\\\frac{c(p^2-1)},\\\\quad Y_J(p)=\\\\frac{2cp\\\\sin\\\\gamma}{p^2+2p\\\\cos\\\\gamma+1},\\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad \\\\gamma=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha-\\\\beta}2 (shown dashed in Fig.3, Fig.5). This circle (straight line if \\\\gamma=0, Fig.4) passes through points A,B, the tangent at A being \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\gamma). Biarcs intersect this circle under the constant angle -\\\\omega. 4. Tangent vector to the biarc \\\\mathcal{B}(p) at the join point is \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\left(\\\\tau_{{}_J}\\\\right), where : \\\\tau_{{}_J}(p)={-2}\\\\operatorname{arctan}\\\\dfrac{p\\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}2+\\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\beta}2}{p\\\\cos\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}2+\\\\cos\\\\frac{\\\\beta}2}. 5. Biarcs with p=\\\\pm1 have the join point on the Y-axis (X_J=0), and yield the minimal curvature jump, \\\\min\\\\leftk_2(p)-k_1(p)\\\\right, at J. 6. Degenerate biarcs are: * Biarc \\\\mathcal{B}(0): as p\\\\to0, J(p)\\\\to A, arc AJ vanishes. * Biarc \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\infty): as p\\\\to\\\\pm\\\\infty, J(p)\\\\to B, arc JB vanishes. * Discontinuous biarc \\\\mathcal{B}(p^\\\\ast) includes straight line AP_\\\\infty J or JP_\\\\infty B, and passes through the infinite point P_\\\\infty: : \\\\qquad p^\\\\ast= \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{lll} -\\\\dfrac{\\\\sin\\\\omega}{\\\\sin\\\\alpha},\\\\quad& \\\\text{if}\\\\; \\\\alpha\\\\geqslant\\\\beta\\\\quad(\\\\alpha=\\\\pi\\\\;\\\\Longrightarrow\\\\; p^\\\\ast=-\\\\infty),\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\dfrac{\\\\sin\\\\beta}{\\\\sin\\\\omega},\\\\quad& \\\\text{if}\\\\; \\\\alpha\\\\leqslant\\\\beta\\\\quad(\\\\beta=\\\\pi\\\\;\\\\Longrightarrow\\\\; p^\\\\ast=0). \\\\end{array} \\\\right. Darkened lens-like region in Figs.3,4 is bounded by biarcs \\\\mathcal{B}(0),\\\\,\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\infty). It covers biarcs with p>0. Discontinuous biarc is shown by red dash-dotted line. 7. The whole family \\\\mathcal{B}(p;\\\\,\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,c) can be subdivided into three subfamilies of non-degenerate biarcs: : \\\\begin{array}{l} \\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,+}(p){:}\\\\quad p\\\\in(0;\\\\infty);\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_1(p){:}\\\\quad p\\\\in(p^\\\\ast;0);\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_2(p){:}\\\\quad p\\\\in(-\\\\infty;p^\\\\ast);\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}(p) = \\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_1(p) \\\\cup \\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_2(p)\\\\right]. \\\\end{array} Subfamily \\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_1 vanishes if p^\\\\ast=0 (\\\\beta=\\\\pi). Subfamily \\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_2 vanishes if p^\\\\ast=-\\\\infty (\\\\alpha=\\\\pi). In figures 3, 4, 5 biarcs \\\\color{sienna}\\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,+} are shown in brown, biarcs \\\\color{blue}\\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_1 in blue, and biarcs \\\\color{green}\\\\mathcal{B}^{\\\\,-}_2 in green.

Life  Her father was Welf I (d. 825), Count of Altorf in Alamannia; her mother was Hedwig (Heilwig; c. 775 ‚Äì after 833), a daughter of the Saxon count Isambart. Emma's elder sister was Judith, who in February 819 married the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious, and thereby became Queen consort of the Franks and Holy Roman Empress. The marriage marked a crucial step forward in the rise of the Welf dynasty. In 827, probably at the instigation of Judith, Hemma married Louis the German, the youngest son of Emperor Louis the Pious from his first marriage with Ermengarde of Hesbaye, and stepson of Hemma's sister Judith. The wedding ceremony possibly took place in Regensburg, where Louis the German resided as King of Bavaria subordinate to his father. In 833, Hemma received Oberm√ºnster Abbey in Regensburg from her husband. Emperor Louis died in 840. After severe innerdynastic struggles, the Carolingian Empire eventually was divided according to the Treaty of Verdun in 843. The Kingdom of Bavaria was merged with Louis the German's Kingdom of East Francia (the predecessor of the Kingdom of Germany), and his wife Hemma became the first East Frankish queen. Hemma is rarely mentioned in contemporary sources; she does not seem to have had much influence on her husband's rule. The Annales Bertiniani written by Archbishop Hincmar of Reims however reproach her for a pride which displeased the people of Italy. She is also said to have inordinately favoured her son Carloman, designated heir of his father in Bavaria, which led to a revolt by his brothers. Hemma suffered a stroke in 874 and subsequently became paralyzed and speechless; King Louis visited her the last time in 875. She died on 31 January 876, a few months before her husband, and was buried in St. Emmeram's Abbey, Regensburg. Her tomb, erected around 1300, is considered a masterpiece of medieval sculpture.  Family  By Louis, she had eight children: *Hildegard (827‚Äì856) *Carloman (828‚Äì880) *Ermengard ( c. 830-866) *Gisela, married to Berctolf, Count of Swabia. Grandmother of Cunigunde of Swabia, wife of Conrad I. *Emma *Louis the Younger (830‚Äì882) *Bertha (died 877) *Charles the Fat (839‚Äì888) Her sons became Kings; three of her daughters became nuns.

Oppel (born Jan. 30, 1943 in Newark, N.J.) is an American journalist and editor living in Austin, Texas. He is interim editor-in-chief (May 5, 2018 ‚Äì Feb. 1, 2019) of Texas Monthly, an Austin-based publication with a statewide readership of 2.4 million. The magazine covers the Texas scene, from politics, the environment, industry and education to music, the arts, travel, restaurants, museums and cultural events. While Oppel was editor of The Charlotte Observer (1978‚Äì1993), the newspaper earned three Pulitzer Prizes, sharing one for editorial cartoons with The Atlanta Constitution.  Early life and education  Oppel is the son of the late Alfred W. and Jane G. Oppel. He graduated from Northeast High School in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1960 and joined the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, serving six months on active duty. He graduated from the University of South Florida with a B.A. degree in political science in 1964.  Journalism career  In 1963, Oppel began his news career as a reporter covering police and rural news at The Tampa Tribune. He joined The Associated Press in 1965 in the state capital bureau in Tallahassee. In 1967, he was named Tampa correspondent, and in 1969 night news editor in Miami. The same year, he was named correspondent in charge of the Tallahassee bureau. He became state news editor in Miami in 1972, and in 1973 was promoted to Michigan chief of bureau in Detroit. Oppel left AP in 1976 to join Knight-Ridder Newspapers. His first job was as associate editor of the Detroit Free Press. In 1977 he became executive editor of the Tallahassee Democrat, where he led the staff in conversion of the newspaper from afternoon to morning publication. In 1978, Oppel was named editor and vice president of The Charlotte Observer, the largest newspaper in the Carolinas. He served in that position until 1993, when he took over the Knight-Ridder Washington bureau as chief of bureau. Oppel left Knight-Ridder to become editor and vice president of the Austin American-Statesman in 1995, retiring from that position in 2008.  Post-newspapers career  In 2009 Oppel began work as senior vice president/media for Public Strategies Inc. (PSI) of Austin, serving as a strategy adviser to national firms in finance, law, computers, airlines, energy and telecommunications. In 2010, PSI merged with Hill & Knowlton to become Hill+Knowlton Strategies. Both firms were owned by the WPP Group. He left H&K; in 2012 to serve as a visiting professor of journalism at Huston‚ÄìTillotson University, a historically black institution of 1,000 students in Austin. In 2014 he was named interim vice president for institutional advancement, and helped raise money and lead construction of the Sandra Joy Anderson Community Health and Wellness Center to provide medical care to students and low-income residents in neighborhoods surrounding the university. He left HT in early 2016. Oppel worked as senior vice president of Crosswind Media & Public Relations of Austin in 2016‚Äì2017, representing diverse clients in energy, infrastructure and healthcare, including trade associations before the Texas Legislature. On Feb. 1, 2018, Oppel was hired by owner Paul Hobby to serve as ombudsman of Texas Monthly after Tim Taliaferro, then the editor-in-chief, drew media criticism for allegedly entering into an arrangement with the dating app Bumble. According to Columbia Journalism Review, Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd would appear on the cover in exchange for a $25,000‚Äì30,000 social-media push by the dating company. Taliaferro denied there was any arrangement, saying the cover decision had been made before the social-media push was discussed. Taliaferro was hired after Hobby‚Äôs private equity firm, Genesis Park Partners, bought the magazine in October 2016. After Oppel served briefly as ombudsman, Hobby announced that Oppel would become interim editor-in-chief of the Monthly on May 5, 2018.  Awards and achievements  Oppel has served as vice president of the Florida Society of Newspaper Editors, president of the North Carolina Press Association, and chair of the North Carolina First Amendment Association. He served as a member and then chair of the Journalism Advisory Committee of the Knight Foundation, a $2 billion foundation that distributed grants to journalism organizations and supported the transformation of the industry toward digital news with high standards. In 2000‚Äì2001, he was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the largest organization of newspaper editors. At that time, the membership was 600. From 2000 until 2009, he was a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board and, in 2008‚Äì2009, was co-chair of the board. While editor of The Charlotte Observer, Oppel led that newspaper to win two Pulitzer Prizes for Meritorious Public Service ‚Äì the gold medals ‚Äì considered the highest prize in journalism. The first, awarded in 1981, was for ‚ÄúBrown Lung: A Case of Deadly Neglect,‚Äù an investigation of how cotton dust in textile mills caused the disease of byssinosis among workers. In 1988, The Observer won its second Meritorious Public Service medal for revealing misuse of funds by the PTL television ministry operated by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Longtime Observer editorial cartoonist Doug Marlette also won a Pulitzer in 1988, for work he did at The Observer and The Atlanta Constitution. Three of the five Pulitzers in The Observers history were won under Oppel‚Äôs tenure. When The Observer and the afternoon Charlotte News merged news staffs in 1983, Oppel became editor of both newspapers until the Newss demise in 1985. Oppel was given the Distinguished Alumni Award by the University of South Florida in 1979, and received the 1987 Ben Bradlee Editor of the Year Award from the National Press Association. Family Oppel is married to Carol Van Aken Oppel, a licensed lay preacher in the Episcopal Diocese of Texas. Previously, she was a freelance writer for religious publications. Their son, Richard A. Oppel Jr., is a national correspondent for The New York Times. Their daughter, Shelby Oppel Wood, is a former columnist for The Oregonian in Portland and now works as a freelance contributor to advertising and public relations agencies. She and her husband Nate Wood, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey, are the parents of two daughters, Elektra and Roxanne.

His feature documentaries include The Fabulous Allan Carr, Tab Hunter Confidential, I Am Divine, Vito, Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon and Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story.  Early career  A New York native, Schwarz is a graduate of the SUNY Purchase Film Department. His senior thesis documentary was Al Lewis in the Flesh, a short film profiling Al Lewis, famous for playing Grandpa on the television series The Munsters. The film observes Lewis as he interacts with the public at his Bleecker Street restaurant, Grampa's Bella Gente, and judges a low-rent Halloween costume contest at a corporate event. The documentary, which observed the American pastime of celebrity adulation, led to Schwarz's on- going interest in producing films about popular culture and Americana. His first job in the film industry was as an apprentice editor on The Celluloid Closet, Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's film adaptation of Vito Russo's seminal book. Schwarz's work on this project would later bridge into the development of his own documentary about Russo, titled simply Vito. Schwarz spent the late 1990s working in the low budget feature world, editing movies and trailers for directors such as Gary Graver, Fred Olen Ray and David DeCoteau. In 1998, Schwarz was hired to edit a documentary about the making of Gus Van Sant's controversial remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Psycho Path was included on the Universal Pictures Home Entertainment DVD release of Psycho, and was Schwarz's first foray into the burgeoning world of DVD bonus features, also known as value added material (VAM). As the DVD format was introduced to the public, all the major studios began offering making-of featurettes and audio commentaries on their discs as an incentive to consumers to replace movies they already owned on VHS or laserdisc. Schwarz capitalized on this moment to segue into producing original bonus content, and soon became one of the leading producers in this field.  Automat Pictures  As assignments from the studios began to proliferate, Schwarz founded the Koreatown, Los Angeles based Automat Pictures in 2000 to keep up with the demand. Schwarz and a team of skilled producers created content for over 100 major DVD and Blu-ray studio releases, and soon expanded into the production of studio EPKs (electronic press kits) and original television programming. Some notable DVD releases produced by Schwarz include Raging Bull, The Silence of the Lambs, Blue Velvet, This Is Spinal Tap, Philadelphia, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Rent, Menace II Society, When Harry Met Sally..., Footloose, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Fargo, Basic Instinct, Hairspray, Friday, and all six films in the Resident Evil franchise. Schwarz produced documentaries and audio commentaries for a range of notable filmmakers including Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Jonathan Demme, Ron Howard, Wes Craven, Rob Reiner, Joe Dante, Barry Sonnenfeld, Paul Verhoeven, Larry Cohen, John Carpenter, Chris Columbus, Roger Corman, Nora Ephron, Sidney Lumet, and the Coen Brothers. Schwarz's television productions include Starz's Sex and the Cinema, a look at sexuality on film; In the Gutter, a history of the gross-out movie; Hitchcocked!, a tribute to the artistry of Alfred Hitchcock; and Shooting the Police: Cops on Film. For IFC he produced Reservoir Dogs Revisited, a celebration of Quentin Tarantino's classic, and Still Swingin', a tribute to the indie classic Swingers. Schwarz also produced several episodes of HBO First Look. In 2007, Schwarz began to segue into producing independent documentary features, the first being Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story about cult filmmaker William Castle. This set into motion a series of award- winning independent documentaries, and as the proliferation of bonus content began to wane with the advent of streaming, Automat Pictures shifted its focus to feature film production.  Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story  Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story is a biographical documentary about legendary Hollywood showman William Castle, who specialized in producing low- budget shockers. Featuring interviews with Castle's daughter Terry, John Waters, Joe Dante, John Landis, Leonard Maltin, Roger Corman, John Badham, Diane Baker, and Marcel Marceau, among others, the film premiered at the 2007 American Film Institute's AFI Fest and was awarded the Audience Award for Best Documentary. It received many other festival honors and was released as part of the William Castle box set in 2009 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. In 2011 the film was released as a stand-alone Special Edition DVD and is currently streaming on Vimeo. It has aired on The Documentary Channel and TCM.  Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon  In 2008, Schwarz directed the feature documentary Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon, which focused on the life and career of porn star Jack Wrangler, who became a superstar in both the gay and straight markets before marrying singer Margaret Whiting and retiring from the business. The film features Wrangler as well as a host of notable golden age porn figures such as Samantha Fox, Gloria Leonard, Jamie Gillis, Al Goldstein, Joe Gage, Sharon Mitchell and Candida Royalle. Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon would go on to win a GayVNAward in 2009 for Best Alternative Release, air on the Logo TV, and debut on DVD through TLA Releasing. Jack Wrangler lived long enough to see the film just before its premiere, and died soon after its launch on the festival circuit in 2009.  Vito  For his next feature, Vito, Schwarz focused on the life of Vito Russo - gay activist, film scholar, author of The Celluloid Closet, and major figure in the fight against AIDS. The film, executive produced by Bryan Singer and produced for HBO Documentary Films, premiered at the 2011 New York Film Festival and made its television debut on HBO in July 2012. Vito received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Research at the 2013 News and Documentary Emmy Awards, as well as a GLAAD Media Award nomination for Outstanding Documentary. Critically well-received, Vito was hailed by Time Magazine as a document that shows how civil rights and entertainment are \\"deeply connected.\\" Based on rejuvenated interest in Russo's life and work, Schwarz edited two volumes of Russo's writing entitled Out Spoken: A Vito Russo Reader.  I Am Divine  In 2013, Schwarz turned his lens to famed Baltimore drag performer Divine with the celebratory documentary, I Am Divine. Featuring extensive interviews with contemporaries and admirers including Divine's mother Frances Milstead, John Waters, Mink Stole, Tab Hunter, Bruce Vilanch, Susan Lowe, Peaches Christ, and Ricki Lake, to name a few. The film had its world premiere at the 2013 South by Southwest Film Festival, and garnered much critical praise and audience good will. It was released on DVD by Wolfe Video, who surprised critics with a chocolate turd along with their review copies.  Tab Hunter Confidential  Following Tab Hunter's participation in I Am Divine, Schwarz was approached by Hunter's partner, Allan Glaser, about adapting Hunter's best-selling autobiography, Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star (2005, co-written with Eddie Muller), into a documentary feature. The film features extensive interviews with Tab Hunter, as well as friends and associates such as John Waters, Debbie Reynolds, Clint Eastwood, and George Takei. It had its World Premiere at the 2015 South by Southwest Film Festival, and went on to screen at festivals around the world to great acclaim. Tab, Allan, and Jeffrey traveled the globe meeting old fans and new, spreading Tab's message of self-acceptance and gratitude.  The Fabulous Allan Carr  Schwarz' latest film is a documentary about flamboyant Hollywood producer Allan Carr, famous for producing Grease, Can't Stop the Music, La Cage aux Folles, and the notorious 1989 Academy Awards broadcast. It made its debut at the 2017 Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF). It features interviews with Patricia Birch, Maxwell Caulfield, Steve Guttenberg, Randy Jones, Randal Kleiser, Sherry Lansing, Lorna Luft, Michael Musto, Robert Osborne, Brett Ratner, Connie Stevens, Alana Stewart, Marlo Thomas, Bruce Vilanch and more.  Frameline Award  On June 20, 2015 San Francisco's Frameline Film Festival presented Jeffrey with The Frameline Award. The award is designed to honor those who have made a major contribution to LGBT representation in film, television, or the media arts. Vito Russo was the first recipient in 1986, and other honorees include Divine, Rob Epstein, Marlon Riggs, Christine Vachon, Barbara Hammer, Isaac Julien, Fenton Bailey & Randy Barbato, Rose Troche, Gregg Araki, Francois Ozon, George and Mike Kuchar, Margaret Cho, and George Takei. A link to Jeffrey Schwarz' award presentation is available on YouTube.  Producing  Schwarz has served as producer, co-producer, and executive producer on Ron Nyswaner's She's the Best Thing In It, Michael Stabile's Seed Money: The Chuck Holmes Story, Elijah Drenner's That Guy Dick Miller, and Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's And the Oscar Goes To. He was also consulting producer on Lisa Dapolito and CNN Films‚Äô Love, Gilda, which premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, as well as Jennifer Kroot's The Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin.

Development Development started in 2000 by Sema Group plc, an IT services company which was acquired by Schlumberger Ltd in 2001 and became SchlumbergerSema. (The company has since been acquired by France-based IT group Atos, SA.) Atos now continue to develop and maintain the system. The first machines were bought and put into use by train operating companies (TOCs) in 2002. By late 2005, market penetration had reached 80%, and as of 2007 SPORTIS has been superseded completely. The AVANTIX Mobile system was designed for the Sema Group plc by Printer Systems Limited this included the technique of printing and encoding the magnetic stripe at the same time, the Z-fold ticket pack and the electronic control system with interface to a Casio PDA. The AVANTIX Mobile housing was designed, developed and engineered by Hyphen Design Ltd, of London. Particular design and engineering challenges were a tamper-resistant PDA retention and ejection mechanism, and a secure loading door latch, to prevent the device spilling ticket stock or batteries if dropped onto concrete from a height of 1.5M. Hyphen Design also developed a cartridge design for holding Z-fold or fan-fold ticket stock. With the horizontally mounted cartridge, a stack of 3 or five or more of the fan-fold stock could easily be drawn into the print head and jam it. The solution was a pad of fine silicone rubber fingers, stuck to the top and bottom internal surfaces of the cartridge, to provide just enough grip on the uneven ticket stack, without putting too much load on the print head. AVANTIX Mobile is the successor to the SPORTIS system which had been developed in the mid-1980s for British Rail. SPORTIS was the first fully computerised portable ticketing system for use by on-train staff and Revenue Protection Inspectors, and in other situations where mobile ticket-issuing facilities are required. However, by 2002, the machines themselves were up to 15 years old, with their underlying technology being several years older, and they lacked the storage capacity for the increasing variety of fares and promotions available on the post-privatisation British railway system. AVANTIX Mobile machines were first adopted by TOCs owned at the time by National Express; however, they are now in use across all National Rail-controlled TOCs with the exception of Merseyrail who continued to issue paper tickets until TVMs had been installed at the last few stations on the Wirral line, which did not have any ticket issuing facilities. Arriva Trains Wales announced in January 2016 that their Avantix machines will be withdrawn after March 2016. The replacement machines will produce paper tickets with no magnetic stripe; instead they will carry a bar code which can be read by some National Rail ticket barriers. As they are not compatible with barriers on the London Underground they will not be accepted for cross-London services on the Underground even if this would normally be included in the fare. A pilot scheme will operate on Cardiff local services from mid-January, however, the tickets issued will not be valid on services operated by other companies, including other Arriva franchises. Ticket stock Whereas the former SPORTIS system was only able to print non-magnetically-encoded tickets on flimsy paper rolls, AVANTIX Mobile can produce tickets both in this format and with magnetic stripe encoding on card tickets with a magnetic stripe. Paper tickets are provided in rolls of 450; card stock comes in \\"fan-fold\\" packs of 250 (however, roll-stock is no longer used as magnetically encoded card stock has become the Rail Settlement Plan standard). Magnetically encoded tickets have the advantage of being able to operate the automatic ticket gates which are used at a large number of National Rail stations throughout Britain, as well as at the majority of London Underground stations. Paper roll tickets carry the Rail Settlement Plan form number RSP 3594: the same as on post- privatisation SPORTIS tickets, as SPORTIS used the same blank stock. Gatwick Express has frequently used dedicated stock, RSP 3594/GA, with a red colour scheme and security background (RSP 3594 is orange with a pale green background). Three types of card stock have been used: two versions with the form number RSP 3599, and one (used most often as of 2007) numbered RSP 9299. On the first version of RSP 3599, each ticket had diagonally cut-off corners, but this later changed to rounded corners as is standard on most other ticket issuing systems. Both of these types had pre-printed headings such as \\"Class\\" and \\"Ticket Type\\". With the move to \\"Common Stock\\" ticketing, where all information is printed by the machine, RSP 9299 stock with no pre-printed headings was introduced. These tickets have always had rounded corners. System description Redhill. An AVANTIX Mobile machine used on board the 1524 Central Trains service from Nottingham to Lincoln Central on 26 May 2007. The machine as a whole consists of a specialised PDA device, upon which all fare, timetable and other data is stored; a small ticket printer and its batteries; the blank ticket stock; and a ticket cradle which holds the tickets when they have been printed. The printer and ticket stock are housed within a plastic case into which the PDA slides. Including the plastic casing, an AVANTIX Mobile machine is 262 mm tall, 126 mm wide and has a depth of 175 mm. Total weight including batteries, a full set of ticket stock and the padded shoulder strap, is 2.03 kg. Thermal printing is used, with a magnetically encoded ticket typically taking seconds to print. The printer uses two lithium-ion batteries, similar to those used in many standard consumer electronics products. These are charged in standard charging trays as used in camcorders, for example. AVB issues tickets on magnetically encoded common ticket stock. The thermally printed tickets emerge from the top of the printer. There are three options for credit-card acceptance * a Gemalto Magic 1100 Chip & PIN reader can be plugged into the printer * a VeriFone Xplorer terminal can be used with Bluetooth connectivity to the IT-10 PDA * a Thyron MPT600 terminal can be used with Bluetooth connectivity to the IT-10 PDA For passengers who do not have a Chip and PIN or Chip and Signature payment card, these are processed by a swipe slot in the AVANTIX casing which reads the magnetic stripe of the card and requires the buyer to sign a card receipt. This magnetic read head can also be used to swipe suitable magnetic tickets and will tell the user if the ticket has been through a ticket barrier. The PDA works as a touch screen instrument using either stylus or finger. The fares and timetable information on the PDA is stored on a memory card. Updates are downloaded when the PDA is in a docking station. All fares are on AVB although advance purchase tickets can't be sold as generally these require seat reservations. Only weekly season tickets can be sold. Monthly and annual prices can be looked up by going to the season enquiry menu. All types of Railcard discounts, local council discount schemes and other concessions are loaded on to an AVB. Plusbus tickets and rover tickets can also be sold along with certain ferry and bus through ticketing. AVB can handle both CRS station short codes and National Location Codes (NLCs); but if the user does not know either code, typing in the station name will bring the fares up. Timetable information can also be accessed by using the timetable enquiry facility. Whilst using the timetable enquiry screen, if you highlight the start and end of one leg of the train journey and choose select this will then show where that train started and every planned stop with the times right through to the journey's end. Multiple ticket issues can be done using the shopping basket facility. So if a buyer wishes to purchase numerous tickets they can all be grouped together in the shopping basket and sold as one transaction. The user can also issue group tickets on to just one ticket rather than printing off multiple tickets. Last 16 issues facility shows last 16 tickets issued, which is handy for repeat fare transactions. AVB also comes loaded with a popular products function where a code is entered a screen with the most popular fares for a route will be displayed. This saves the user typing in the origin, destination and ticket type as popular products enable the user to just hit one button on one screen rather than going through 3-4 screens. Cash, Rail Travel Vouchers, Rail Warrants (traders' and armed forces), cheques (in some cases), National Transport Tokens, and Visa, Mastercard and American Express credit/debit cards are all accepted payments for AVB users. Visa Electron and International Maestro cards are not accepted on any portable equipment due to the need for online authorisation. (They are accepted at many train operating companies' ticket counters.) Cards that are programmed always to require on- line authorisation may also not be accepted. Incident enquiry screen shows printer and PDA battery life as well as any non-issued tickets. AVB can be secured by the user to prevent misuse by setting a code word.

There are a number of sources and it's evenly divided between the 25 March or 26 March as the date of death. Hodgetts signed for Aston Villa in February 1886. The following year he scored the first goal in Aston Villa's first FA Cup final triumph. In 1895 he collected another FA Cup winners medal with Villa. Hodgetts was also a key member of the Football League title- winning sides of 1894 and 1896. Hodgetts was described as powerful and alert and good with both feet. He could shoot and pass expertly. He was outstanding at crossing the ball on the run. He played in Aston Villa' opening League game, as a winger, at Dudley Road, Wolverhampton, then home of Wolverhampton Wanderer's. The match ended 1-1. Denny Hodgetts played 17 of the 22 League games Aston Villa played in season 1888-89 scoring seven League goals (including 2 in a match against Everton at Dudley Road on 22 September 1888 - His debut League goal (s)) and 3 FA Cup goals finishing as Joint 3rd top scorer with Archie Hunter. As a winger he played in a midfield that achieved a big (three-League-goals-or-more-in-a-match) win on four occasions. He assisted Aston Villa to finish League runners-up. (registration & fee required) On the eve of Villa's Double-winning success in 1897 (in what would have been his third FA Cup final with Villa) Hodgetts transferred to local rivals Small Heath before retiring in 1898. He made six appearances for England between 1888 and 1894, scoring once. He went on to become a publican, and in 1930 was elected Aston Villa's vice-president, a position he held until his death, aged 81, in March 1945.

It was produced by Orion Pictures and stars Kiefer Sutherland, Ray Liotta, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Rutanya Alda and Lea Thompson. The soundtrack was composed by Danny Elfman. The film's title supposedly refers to a legal loophole, which states that unless an illness/injury is related to military service, a veteran is not eligible for VA hospital benefits. Plot Pat Travis (Troy Evans) is a Vietnam war veteran who needs heart bypass surgery and heads off to the government-funded Monument Heights Veterans' Hospital in Washington D.C. However, when he gets there, he finds a hospital in complete chaos, riddled with lethargic, insidious bureaucracy and unable to accommodate new patients due to the government's 'creeping cutback' policy. There, he meets wiseguy veterans Luther Jerome (Keith David), who introduces him to the hospital's hectic situation, and 'Shooter' Polaski (Leo Burmester), who shortly drives through the hospital's entrance and starts a shooting rampage with his M16 after being issued an Article 99 form - which states the hospital finds the patient eligible for treatment, but cannot be treated immediately as the supposed ailment is not service-related. The hospital is managed by by-the-book bureaucrat Executive Director Dr. Henry Dreyfoos (John Mahoney), who is determined to uphold the government's policies by any means, to the point of directly cutting patient's acceptance rates by half and instituting rigorous dress codes and supply regulations. He's backed up by Chief of Medicine Leo Krutz (Jeffrey Tambor) and Chief Nurse Amelia Sturdeyvant (Julie Bovasso), who follow and back-up Dreyfoos' policies, fearing for their jobs. Dreyfoos greatest opposition comes from the hospital's ER team led by surgeon Dr. Richard Sturgess (Ray Liotta), who has no qualms in exposing Dreyfoos' politicking to the press when he has the opportunity (mostly thanks to his friend Luther) and performing illegal midnight hospital supply thefts called 'midnight requisitions' to be able to properly perform surgeries. Dreyfoos is aware of Sturgess' activities, but cannot prosecute him as he is unable to gather evidence. Sturgess' team is joined by Dr. Peter Morgan (Kiefer Sutherland), who plans to work temporarily in the hospital before starting private practice. He's eventually instructed by Sturgess and his colleagues Ruby Bobrick (John C. McGinley), Sid Handleman (Forest Whitaker) and Robin Van Dorn (Lea Thompson) and constantly monitored by Nurse White (Lynne Thigpen). His 'potential' after failing to attend to Travis' heart attack and causing a ruptured artery leads Sturgess to try and convince him to join the team and also fight Dreyfoos' administration, but Morgan refuses, fearful their wrongdoings will eventually influence his medical career. Meanwhile, Morgan also meets World War II veteran Sam Abrams (Eli Wallach), considered by the hospital a 'gomer', a person who cannot be admitted even with a critical condition and has to be constantly moved and kept from administration so he will not be discharged. Abrams' sharing of experiences with Morgan has the newcomer doctor slowly start caring for him and start disagreeing with several of the hospital's conditions, especially that he cannot accommodate the veteran and has to use old diagnoses to repeat needless exams. Morgan also starts a relationship with Robin while Sturgess does so with psychologist Diana Walton (Kathy Baker), equally a by-the-book character that slowly starts opening up to Sturgess shortly after Polaski's incident. Morgan learns, through overhearing Dreyfoos' conversation through the phone, a new shipment of cardiac surgery tools is stored in the pathology department and relays it to Sturgess, who performs a 'midnight requisition' to get them. However, this was a trap set by Dreyfoos, who films the theft and blackmails Sturgess into voluntary suspension and a declaration of guilt when charges are brought up, in exchange for the tape and a written declaration sparing both Bobrick and Handleman. Sturgess falls apart while Walton backs him up, committed on not giving up on him. Shortly after, Abrams passes away and this affects Morgan heavily, feeling he failed him. Morgan eventually finds Dreyfoos' tape and, infuriated he was used as bait, declares open rebellion against Dreyfoos, getting himself suspended. Morgan arranges for Sturgess to return to the hospital and both, along with Luther and the veterans, start planning a hostile takeover to properly attend the patients without the administration's interference. The veterans successfully lock the security guards outside while Dreyfoos is away, and Luther, armed with Polaski's M16, keeps the guards away while the police, despite being pressured, cannot remove the veterans as the hospital is under federal jurisdiction. It does not take long before the press arrive and this catches attention of the FBI and the Inspector General (Noble Willingham), who travels to assess the situation. The Inspector General attempts negotiating with Luther, but he stands his ground as the veterans unfurl a massive banner in the hospital stating 'No Surrender'. The FBI prepares to break into the hospital and retake it by force, cutting off the power and issuing a final warning. Sturgess, who starts Travis' triple bypass surgery after he falls into critical condition, leaves Morgan in charge as he convinces Luther to lay down resistance and reopen the hospital, much to the Inspector General's shock. He and Dreyfoos enter the building and attempt to interrupt Travis' surgery and have Morgan arrested, but Morgan stands his ground. Dreyfoos tries insisting on the arrest, but the Inspector General, revealed to have been a Vietnam veteran and acknowledging the situation the hospital is facing, spares Morgan and suspends Dreyfoos from the hospital management. Morgan decides to become a permanent resident in Monument Heights as no prosecutions are made and Travis is saved. Victory is sadly short-lived, as Dreyfoos' unnamed replacement decides to upkeep Dreyfoos' previous policies. Morgan and Sturgess decide to join up and make a stand against the 'new' administration.

It is based on the C12 platform, alongside the Spyker designed C12 La Turbie which debuted the previous year, and features a unique body designed with help from Italian design house Zagato. Spyker C12 Zagato at the 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show On March 6, 2007, Spyker announced the C12 Zagato at the Salon International de l'Auto in Geneva. The Milanese design house Zagato co- designed the model. The C12 Zagato featured all-new design elements inspired by Formula 1. Though the exterior styling is somewhat of a departure from the C8, it retained key features of the C8 such as the scissor doors, interior styling, and general aviation theme. The C12 Zagato is powered by a 6.0 L W12 engine sourced from VW Group (the same engine as featured in the Audi A8 and Volkswagen Phaeton). For the C12 Zagato, Spyker Cars have tuned the W12 to produce 500 PS. The C12 Zagato was to be offered with a choice of a 6-speed automatic gearbox with paddle-shifters or a traditional 6-speed manual. The Spyker C12 Zagato was priced at EUR 495,000 (approximately US$740,000 or ¬£450,000), and Spyker planned to produce only 24 cars, with deliveries set to begin in early 2008. However, in July 2007, it was announced that C12 production was delayed, and a couple of months later in October announced that it was cancelled, as Spyker had decided to focus their resources on other models such as the C8 and then-upcoming SSUV. Reportedly, only one prototype was built before production was cancelled. Performance The C12 Zagato develops and from the specially-tuned W12 engine. With a KERB weight of , the Spyker will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds, and then on to a top speed of . Braking is accomplished by steel ventilated discs and features anti-lock braking.

All 74 passengers and crew died upon impact. The accident remains the deadliest in Uruguayan history.  Aircraft and crew  The aircraft involved in the accident was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32, registration LV-WEG. It had its maiden flight in 1969, and was 28 years old at the time of the accident. It had previously operated for Iberia with registration EC-BQT, and it was transferred to the airline in 1993 after the buyout of the company by the Spanish carrier. The captain was 40-year-old Jorge C√©cere, who had been with the airline since 1989 and logged 9,238 hours, including 223 hours on the DC-9. The first officer was Horacio N√∫√±ez, who was also 40. He had been with the airline since 1993 and had 2,910 flight hours. He was more experienced on the DC-9 than captain C√©cere, with 1,384 hours on that aircraft.  Accident  The aircraft, which left from Posadas and was due to land in Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, Buenos Aires, was forced to divert towards Fray Bentos to avoid a storm. Examination of the aircraft's flight data recorder (FDR) revealed that shortly after the diversion occurred, the aircraft airspeed indicator began to fall to an alarmingly low indicated airspeed. Unbeknownst to the pilots, this was caused not directly, by a loss of power, but by ice formed inside the pitot tube, which reads the airspeed for the indicator by measuring the pressure of inflow air. The ice obstructing the pitot tube reduced the air inflow, thus giving an erroneously low indicated airspeed. In response to what they interpreted as a loss of engine power, the pilots gradually increased power from the engines in order to maintain airspeed; seeing no improvement, they contacted the control tower in Ezeiza Airport and requested clearance to descend to a lower altitude. After receiving no response, the Captain decided to descend to a lower altitude to increase speed even with no clearance received from the Air Traffic Control. While descending from their assigned altitude of 35,000 feet and reaching 31,700 feet, the Captain identified the faulty airspeed indication and ordered the First Officer to stop descending and to reduce speed, because the readings were unreliable. However, the First Officer disregarded the Captain's commands and deployed the wings' slats to maintain their altitude and lower the plane's stall speed. Consequently, at this point the airplane was actually flying at a higher speed than normal; it was descending, which further increased airspeed to a point dangerously near to VNE, the \\"never exceed speed\\", above which structural damage to the aircraft might occur. With the slats extended at a speed beyond their operational limits, one of them was torn from the aircraft, causing catastrophic asymmetry in the airflow over the wings. The aircraft immediately became uncontrollable and crashed. According to an investigation by both the Argentine and Uruguayan Air Forces, the pitot tube‚Äîthe primary instrument for measuring aircraft airspeeds‚Äîfroze when the aircraft passed through a high cumulonimbus cloud, blocking the instrument and causing it to give a false reading. Compounding this problem was the absence of the alarm designed to report such a malfunction (raising serious questions about inspection irregularities by the Argentine Air Force). During the descent, the FDR recorded an increase in the airspeed from to in three seconds, which could only signify the sudden unfreezing of the pitot tube. Specialists estimated that the aircraft crashed almost perpendicularly to the ground, at a speed of . Depending upon the source, the crater left by the crash was deep and wide, deep and wide, or deep and wide.

The current Gothic church was designed by architect John Pinch the Elder and completed in 1832, although it retains the 15th-century tower of its predecessor, All Hallows Church. Churchyard There are over 90 tablets in the churchyard and more within the church, with some going back to the 12th century. The church kept excellent records which indicated that most of those buried here had no connection with the town but chose the spot for their final repose because it was an idyllically isolated community, away from the smog and congestion of Bath. This popularity lasted for over 200 years. Medieval church An early church is mentioned by Pope Adrian IV in an 1156 Bull. Jordanus, the first vicar, arrived at Weston in 1297. In the 15th century, All Hallows Church was built but was demolished in 1830 to create a larger space for a growing community, with only its tower surviving. The church bells were recast by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family at Chew Stoke in 1739, and were repaired and retuned between 1952 and 1953. Today the tower has six bells from 1739 and two from 1952. Victorian church The tower of the church The new church of All Saints was consecrated on 2 June 1832. It shares some similarities with Pinch‚Äôs other works at St. Mary the Virgin, Bathwick and St. Saviour, Larkhall, although both of those examples were new-builds and are defined by tall western towers, whereas All Saints is more diminished. New seating with new transepts and a chancel were added between 1880 and 1893, and new clergy and choir vestries were added in 1909. The church furnishings and internal program have been remodelled several times since then and recently a restoration was undertaken of the tower. Near the tower door is a 19th-century font, and on the West Gallery are displayed William and Mary‚Äôs royal coat of arms. The church was designated as Grade II listed in 1955. Notable features On the south aisle is the St Alphege window, which \\"commemorates the famous saint whom tradition says was born in Weston (St Alphege became the Abbot of Bath Abbey and then Archbishop of Canterbury). Also depicted is Guthram, King of the Danes, submitting to King Alfred and accepting Christianity.\\" In the south transept, there is a \\"monument to Alderman Sherston dated 1641; he was Mayor of Bath in 1632.

The church was demolished in 1818. Its parish was succeeded by St Mary the Virgin's Church, Bathwick on Church Road at the base of Bathwick Hill. Its churchyard is currently contained in that of St John the Baptist's Church, Bathwick. Medieval in origin, it was recorded in May 1815 as being merely 64 feet long, 17 feet wide with room for 130 people seated. It featured a dominant Early English tower, a nave and chancel and large nearly triangular buttresses. By the Georgian era, it was fast becoming a ruin. With William Pulteney's purchase of the Manor of Bathwick estate in 1727, the Pulteneys wished to relieve themselves of the small ruin on their estate, but waited until they had developed the property. By 1814, the new parish church of St Mary the Virgin, Bathwick at the base of Bathwick Hill was completed. The designer of that church, John Pinch the Elder, was shortly employed by the Pulteney family to demolish the medieval Mary's, then called Bathwick Old Church, which he carried out in January 1818. Many of the stones, as well as the altar, pulpit and roof timbers, were recycled to construct St Mary the Virgin Parish Church's new mortuary chapel, which was also designed by Pinch the Elder. However, this new chapel never was licensed to perform marriages and only occasionally performed funerals and baptisms. It is now bricked in, abandoned, and thoroughly decrepit. The churchyard and many of the burial plots of Bathwick Old Church still exists in St John the Baptist, Bathwick Churchyard. The east end of the Victorian church of St John's now occupies the west end tower location of Bathwick Old Church. The entirety of St John's was designed to fit in the old church's space.

The term is all-embracing, unscientific, and rather imprecise. Impala and Thomson's gazelle are classic examples of plains game, but the term also encompasses a great range of species from the diminutive steenbok to the massive eland. Plains game species are distinct from species of dangerous game, which generally consists of the Big 5 as well as crocodile and hippopotamus. For this reason, virtually any species of game in Africa that is not considered dangerous game may be broadly referred to as plains game. Where the term \\"plains game\\" is used as an indication of the kind of game for which particular sporting rifle cartridges are deemed suitable, it is fair to assume that the same ammunition also performs efficiently on other ungulates occurring elsewhere in the world, such as deer.

It was famous as the residence of many senior figures in the government of the German Democratic Republic. The Majakowskiring neighbourhood (Ortslage) is situated between Grabbeallee to the west and northwest, Ossietzkystra√üe and Schlosspark to the east, Schloss Sch√∂nhausen to the northeast, and the Panke river to the south. History Until 4 May 1950, the northern section was called Kronprinzenstra√üe and the southern section Viktoriastra√üe. It was then renamed after the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovski. For a short time it was called Majakowskistra√üe. Most of the houses were built in the 1920s and are mainly mansions which were inhabited by industrialists and artists, until the most of them were expropriated after the Second World War. In exceptional cases the former owners were allowed to remain if they continued to pay rent, for example in the case of the house No. 29. When the owners left East Berlin in 1950, these also were expropriated. Until 1960, the members of the GDR government lived here, after the houses were converted to the taste of the new inhabitants by architects like Hans Scharoun. The Majakowskiring (and likewise the Pankow district) became a synonym for the GDR government. Thus Konrad Adenauer spoke of the \\"gentlemen in Pankoff\\", and Udo Lindenberg sang of the \\"special train to Pankow\\". The government representatives living in the Majakowskiring quarter became shielded from the outside world. After the October 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the East German leadership was afraid of the effect of such riots in the East Germany and decided that it was better for the elite to live in less populated place. At first, it was decided to move to Hoppegarten, east of East Berlin, because there was a fast escape route from there over the motorway eastward. In the end, a complex was built in Waldsiedlung, Bernau bei Berlin, and the leadership moved there in 1960. Because of this sealing-off, people called the quarter (little town). When Lotte Ulbricht wanted to return to the Majakowskiring after the death of her husband Walter Ulbricht in 1973, the barriers and controls were waived. However she was forbidden to return to the house they originally lived in. Instead, she was assigned house number 12, in which she lived up to her death in 2002. In 1975, house 28/30 was demolished, as part of the process of erasing every reminder of Walter Ulbricht from history. The house in which Otto Grotewohl lived is today a literature workshop. The house of Johannes R. Becher was sold and is private property.

Those words are cognates of the modern German words \\"Holz\\" and \\"Wald\\" respectively. The word is also found in Scandinavian placenames and in surnames derived from them: in Danish, Norwegian, and Icelandic as Holt (or the more archaic Danish Holdt and Holte); in Swedish as Hult or Hulte; and even in Finnish as Hulti (a loanword from Swedish). It is often used in combination with other words, as in Uhrenholdt (\\"ancient holt\\", a Danish last name taken from that of an estate) or √Ñlghult (\\"elk holt\\"), a village and the site of a small art-glass factory in Sm√•land, Sweden. In Sweden it is most commonly found in and around Sm√•land, including √Ñlmhult, the location of the first IKEA store. Another spelling of the name is \\"Hoult\\", more commonly found in the north of England than in the south, indicating that it is more likely in this case to be derived directly from Old Norse. Related German names include Holz, Holzman, Holzhauer, et al., and their anglicized equivalents which often insert a \\"t\\" between the \\"l\\" and the \\"z\\".

She studied singing in Munich with Karl Erler before beginning her career singing in operettas in that city in 1913. She made her first opera appearance in 1915 as the Page in Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user at the opera house in Krefeld. Soon after she was engaged at the Oper Leipzig up through 1919. Olszewska left Leipzig to join the Hamburg State Opera, where she was engaged from 1919-22. While there she notably portrayed Brigitta/Lucienne in the world premi√®re of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Die tote Stadt on 4 December 1920. While singing in Hamburg she was appointed to the roster of artists at the Vienna State Opera (VSO) in 1921 where she sang through 1923. She was a member of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich from 1923‚Äì25, after which she returned to the VSO from 1925-30. In 1925, she married the baritone (1882‚Äì1957). Olszewska appeared frequently as a guest artist at opera houses around the world. In 1923 and 1928 she was heard as a guest at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. She made numerous appearance at the Royal Opera, London between 1924‚Äì32, where her performances in such roles as Fricka, Ortrud, Brang√§ne and Herodias drew the highest critical acclaim. Her Carmen and Amneris were less successful, but her Octavian and Orlofsky were highly regarded. In the United States she sang in Chicago (1928‚Äì32) and at the Metropolitan Opera. She also gave performances at La Scala, La Monnaie, and highly successful tours in South and Central America. Since 1947, Olszewska taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna and in 1948 she became a lecturer at the Vienna State Opera.

It was thought to be endemic to southern Australia and New Zealand but has since been documented as occurring in the Cape Peninsula as well. It is found around low tide levels and deeper, under rocks and wandering over seaweed in pools. Description Coscinasterias calamaria is the largest starfish in southern Australia and New Zealand. Although called the eleven- armed sea star there can be any number of arms between seven and fourteen, but eleven is the most common number. These starfish are often found with arms of varying lengths. This is because arms sometimes become detached and new arms grow in their place. This starfish has rows of pincer-like pedicellariae on both its upper and lower surface which gives it a prickly appearance. Its total diameter is up to . Distribution Coscinasterias calamaria is native to the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. Its range extends from Rottnest Island in Western Australia round the southern coast to New South Wales and Point Dangar in Queensland, including Tasmania and Lord Howe Island. Biology Coscinasterias calamaria mostly feeds on the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and other benthic invertebrates. It has been found that it seldom feeds on the blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) unless there is a scarcity of mussels. When this happens, aggregations of starfish do feed on it. This is despite laboratory feeding tests demonstrating that it prefers abalone. It seems that the abalone has some behavioural responses to attack that make it more likely to escape, one of which seems to be the production of a chemical deterrent by the mollusc. There are smell chemoreceptors on the tips of the arms, and the starfish can navigate accurately by smell towards a source of food. It then extends its stomach over its prey, secretes enzymes onto it and liquefies before returning the stomach to its normal position. When food is scarce, this starfish can exist for many weeks without food. Coscinasterias calamaria mainly reproduces by fissiparity (self division) by tearing itself in two pieces across the disc. It is capable of regenerating a whole new body from a single arm, but only if the arm includes part of the central disc. It can also reproduce sexually. It is difficult to establish the relative importance of the two forms of reproduction in this starfish but it has been shown that individuals in close proximity to one another have little genetic diversity while starfish collected at separations of as little as have widely different genetic composition, particularly so in the case of subtidal populations.

He joined the LBSCR in 1900 as an apprentice. By the end of 1907 he was a district locomotive superintendent at the railway works at New Cross. From February 1911 Billinton was locum tenens, or caretaker, for Locomotive Engineer D. E. (Earle) Marsh at Brighton works whilst Marsh was on leave of absence due to ill health. Earle Marsh resigned in July 1911. Billinton was promoted to Locomotive Engineer at the beginning of 1912. In 1917 Billinton was commissioned as a temporary Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Engineers, and he served on military missions to Romania and Russia. He retired from the SR aged 40 in 1923, taking up fruit farming at Bolney in Sussex. Billinton died in 1954 at Lyme Regis in Dorset. Early career Lawson Billinton was born in Brighton, the third son of R. J. Billinton, who later became the LBSCR's Locomotive Engineer in 1890. His mother was of Polish origin and his middle name Butzkopfski (sometimes spelled Boskovsky) was her family name. He became a pupil of his father at Brighton works in January 1900. He was a fitter's apprentice from September 1900. In February 1903 he was promoted to draughtsman, and promoted again in September 1903 to inspector of materials. In September 1904 he became assistant foreman at New Cross. R. J. Billinton died in office in November 1904, and was succeeded as Locomotive Engineer by D. E. (Earle) Marsh. Earle Marsh placed Lawson Billinton in charge of all experimental work on the LBSCR's locomotives and rolling stock, including the trials of the new Marsh Atlantics. In January 1906 Billinton was transferred to Brighton as assistant outdoor superintendent, moving back to New Cross in February 1907 and becoming district locomotive superintendent in July of that year. The reconstruction of Brighton works under Marsh caused tremendous difficulties in maintaining and repairing the LBSCR's locomotive stock. Some major repairs and boiler changes began to be carried out at New Cross under Billinton's supervision, but this had little effect on the situation. By 1910 about 30% of the locomotive stock was out of traffic and awaiting repair, and the number of engine failures in service increased substantially in the second half of that year, for which Marsh was held responsible by the directors of the company. Because Earle Marsh was in poor health he was given leave of absence until 30 June 1911, and Billinton was instructed to take general charge of Brighton works as Marsh's locum tenens or caretaker from 15 February 1911. Locomotive Engineer Marsh resigned his post on 1 July 1911. The LBSCR's board of directors initially approached Robert Urie of the London and South Western Railway to be Marsh's successor, but he declined. Instead Billinton was appointed Locomotive Engineer from 1 January 1912 with a starting salary of ¬£1,500 per annum, \\"with management and control of engine construction and repair shops at Brighton and other locomotive depots, and of the work and business to be carried out and done therein.\\" Marsh had been in charge of all the LBSCR's rolling stock, but the board of directors now created a Carriage and Wagon Department at Lancing to be run independently of Billinton's department, to reduce the workload of the Locomotive Engineer. Both Billinton and A. H. Panter, head of the Lancing carriage department, were now required to submit all their proposals for new construction to the LBSCR Locomotive Committee, and proposals for alterations of existing stock to the Superintendent of the Line and the general manager. Under construction at the time of Billinton's promotion were Marsh-designed locomotives of the H2, J and I3 classes. The six members of the H2 class were a superheated development of the H1 Marsh Atlantics, authorised in April 1911 and entering traffic between June 1911 and January 1912, with minor alterations to Marsh's original design by Billinton. The prototype 4-6-2 J tank locomotive, no. 325, was completed in December 1910; construction of the second engine, no. 326, started in May 1911. Since a number of problems were being experienced with no. 325 in traffic Billinton was given permission to halt work on no. 326 in June to concentrate on repairs to existing stock and construction of the H2 class. By the beginning of 1912, when construction recommenced, Billinton had modified the design sufficiently for the locomotive to be given the class designation J2 (the prototype becoming J1). Modifications included replacement of the Stephenson valve gear with Walschaerts gear, a reduction in water tank capacity and the use of spiral springs in the suspension instead of leaf springs. Although no. 326 had better acceleration and a faster top speed than no. 325 no further members of the class were built, in part because the 10 members of the superheated I3 4-4-2 class built between August 1912 and March 1913 proved to be the equal of the J2 class in performance and reliability. Billinton introduced the E2 class 0-6-0T of 1911, the K class 2-6-0 of 1913, and the L class 4-6-4T of 1914. The first Billinton-designed class was the 0-6-0T E2 class of shunting engine, five of which were introduced between June 1913 and January 1914. Two of the class were fitted with equipment for operating passenger trains, and used on six-coach sets in the south London area. Oscillating whilst accelerating, unsteady at speed and with a tendency to throw live coals out of the chimney the locomotives were soon returned to shunting duties. In September 1913 the first of the 2-6-0 K class locomotives entered traffic. These locomotives were intended to fulfill the need to accelerate the speed of goods traffic on the congested London suburban lines. They were fitted with parallel superheated boilers with Belpaire fireboxes (the first such on the LBSCR) and were capable of hauling 1,000 ton trains at an average speed of 30 to 35 mph. The five locomotives of the initial batch were successful enough in working munitions trains to Newhaven at the beginning of World War I for the Government to grant permission for the construction of five more of the class, eventually constructed at the end of 1916. In October 1913 Billinton ordered the design of an enlarged version of the J class tank, with the trailing truck replaced by a bogie. This 4-6-4 or Baltic wheel arrangement was intended to be more stable at speed than the 4-6-2 arrangement of the original design. An order for five locomotives was placed with Brighton Works in November 1913, and the first, no. 327, was completed in April 1914. Construction of the second member of the class, no. 328, was interrupted whilst no. 327 was tested. As at the same time Billinton began a project to design and construct an express 4-6-0 tender locomotive, it has been suggested that he may have been intending to complete no. 328 as such. No. 327 was involved in a couple of minor derailments in August and November 1914, which were ascribed to the surging movement of water in half- full side tanks. The locomotive was withdrawn from service whilst consideration was given to its conversion to a tender engine. Billinton instructed the drawing office in February 1915 to cost both a conversion scheme and a scheme to modify the side tanks to improve stability. As costs appeared to be almost equal it was decided to complete no. 328 as a tank engine, and to modify both locomotives by inserting a well tank between the frames and restricting the depth of water in the side tanks. By the time no. 328 was completed in March 1916 the order for the remaining three locomotives had been cancelled because of wartime material shortages, and nos. 327 and 328 remained the only members of the L class until 1919. Wartime service In March 1917 Billinton was commissioned as a temporary Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Engineers. He commenced active service on 17 March, and was seconded to the British Railway Mission to Russia and Romania, under General de Candolle. Billinton left for Romania on 18 March, travelling via Sweden and Russia. Arriving in Ia≈üi (then the temporary capital of Romania) he found that over 60% of the locomotives of the CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne were out of commission or under repair, and Billinton travelled around Romania reorganising. The military situation in Romania rapidly deteriorated through 1917 as the Russian armies in the country began to collapse. Billinton organised the withdrawal of locomotives and rolling stock from Galicia. In October 1917 the Mission was ordered to the Caucasus. By February 1918 they were in Rostov on Don just prior to the city's capture by the Red Army. Billinton received orders to go to Petrograd with dispatches for the British Ambassador. Arriving in Moscow he met the British Consul General, who informed him that the Ambassador had probably left for Finland. Billinton eventually left Russia via Vladivostok, returning to Britain in June 1918. He was allowed to return to the LBSCR on leave without pay, returning to duty on 25 November 1918 as Head of the British Military Mission to Romania in connection with the reorganisation and reconstruction of the railway system in that country. He was appointed a CBE (3rd Class Military Division) in June 1919. Post-war career Billinton was released from military service on 3 August 1919. Brighton Works was in the immediate post-war years working to full capacity just to clear the backlog of repairs to the locomotive stock. At this time Billinton introduced a top-feed arrangement inside a second dome on replacement boilers. The first new locomotives to be built postwar were seven of a batch of ten K class 2-6-0s, the first being finished in December 1920. Construction of the last three of the batch was cancelled by March 1921. These locomotives were used by Billinton to test various manufacturer's equipment, including feedwater heaters, blastpipes and sanding equipment. A further batch of five L class 4-6-4 tank locomotives was started in July 1921 and completed between October 1921 and April 1922. The last of the batch, no. 333 was dedicated as a War Memorial Engine in April 1923 and named Remembrance. Billinton's final contribution was to order the rebuilding of 12 B4 4-4-0 locomotives, which were fitted with K class type boilers and new frames. Only two were completed by the LBSCR in 1922, the remainder being converted by the Southern Railway. Although the B4x class (as it was designated) now had larger and more modern superheated boilers the rebuilds retained the valve gear of the originals, with the result that the locomotives were throttled by small short-travel valves which could not pass the steam needed for an improved performance. By 1930 the class were relegated from main line duties. The amalgamation of the LBSCR into the Southern Railway Group in 1923. Richard Maunsell became Chief Mechanical Engineer. Billinton took early retirement, leaving his position on 30 June 1923. Shortly afterwards Brighton Works was demoted to a repair depot for locomotives. He purchased a farm near Bolney in Sussex, on which he and his wife grew fruit commercially. Billinton spent two years in Glasgow in the late 1920s as a consultant to the LMS. Billinton died on 26 November 1954 at Lyme Regis.

The title \\"Duke of Aosta\\" continued to be used by the second sons of the Savoyard monarch. The land of the duchy is today a part of Italy. The county of Aosta was originally ruled by the bishops of Aosta in the 10th and early 11th centuries. Upon the death of Bishop Anselm in 1026, however, Conrad the Salic ensured that the secular powers of the important Alpine territory passed to the bishop's brother-in-law, his ally Humbert the White-handed, rather than remaining tied to the diocese, which fell to Anselm's unfriendly nephew Burchard. Humbert's son Odo then wed Adelaide, securing the March of Turin. The county was elevated to a duchy by Frederick Barbarossa. Duke Emmanuel Philibert made French the official language of the duchy in 1561, but it retained its own traditional institutions as late as 1766. It received its first intendant in 1773. It had its own taxation system down to 7 October 1783, when it was brought under the cadaster. According to Jean-Baptiste de Tillier (died 1744): > The duchy of Aosta has always been a state, forming a single undivided body. > The seventy-eight church-towers, or rather the cities, towns, parishes and > separate communities which exist in the Valley, are members of this state.

He was born in the village of Hussein al-Bahr, near Tartous, where he received his early education. He studied journalism in Cairo, Egypt and later served as editor of the art and cultural sections of the Syrian paper Al-Baath and the Lebanese As-Safir. He also held for many years the directorship in the Music and Theater Administration of Syria. In the late Sixties, he traveled to Paris where he studied theater and encountered various currents, trends, and schools of European stage. His career as a playwright had begun in the early Sixties with several short (one-act) plays which were characterized by a display of his fundamental theme: the relationship between the individual and society and its authorities. Career In the late Sixties, triggered by the Arab defeat of the 1967 war with Israel, political Arabic theater was born. The defeat had resulted in the creation of a new level of awareness among artists and intellectuals, particularly toward the government-controlled press and its infiltration of popular culture. In 1969, joined by a group of playwrights, Wannous called for an Arab Festival for Theater Arts to be hosted in Damascus, later realized and attended by dramatists from all over the Arab world. In this festival, he introduced his new project: \\"theater of politicization,\\" to replace the traditional \\"political theater.\\" He intended theater to play a more positive role in the process of social and political change. His other powerful plays include Elephant, the King of All Times (1969), The King is the King (1977) and Hanthala's Journey from Slumber to Consciousness (1978). In the late Seventies, Wannous helped establish and later taught at The High Institute for Theater Arts in Damascus. He also started Theater Life magazine, of which he was editor-in-chief for years. In 1982, and in the aftermath of the Israeli siege and invasion of Beirut, he lived through a period of shock, ceasing to write for a decade. Back to writing in early nineties, Wannous delivered to Arabic theater a series of plays no less political than their predecessors, starting with The Rape (1990), a play about the Arab-Israeli conflict. Since then, he has written Fragments from History (1994), Rituals of Signs and Transformations (1994), Miserable Dreams (1995), A Day of Our Time (1995), and finally Mirage Epic (1996). In 1996, he was Selected by UNESCO and the International Institute of Theater, to present that year's address to the world theater community during its celebration of International Theater Day on March 27. This was the first selection of an Arab writer since the organization started this tradition in 1963. Personal life His daughter Dima Wannous is a journalist, writer and novelist.

According to popular legend, the house was the first place tobacco was smoked in England, by Sir Walter Long and his friend Sir Walter Raleigh (although this has also been said of other houses related to Raleigh). History of the house and its land It is possible that there was manor house in the 14th century, which later became Manor Farmhouse. The present house stands a short distance to the southwest of that site. The first known member of the Long family to own land in South Wraxall was Robert Long, a lawyer who was on the Commission of the Peace in 1426 and represented Old Sarum in Parliament in 1414, and Wiltshire between 1421 and 1442. He had a house there in 1429 and a few years later he exchanged lands in Wraxall with the Abbess of Shaftesbury. He died in 1447. His great- great grandson Sir Robert Long altered the doorway to the Long chapel in 1566, having his initials and badges carved into the stone above it. Arms of Long of South Wraxall: Sable sem√©e of cross-crosslets, a lion rampant argent Over the generations, the Long family acquired more and more land, until eventually they owned all the property within South Wraxall that had once belonged to Monkton Farleigh Priory. The manor was passed down through the Longs of Wraxall until it reached Walter Long who died unmarried in 1807, and his unmarried sister Katherine continued to live in it till her death aged 97, in 1814. By his will it then passed to his cousins, Richard Godolphin Long of Rood Ashton, and his brother John. It was over 150 years before another member of the Long family lived at the manor for any length of time. The house was first let from 1820 to 1826 to a Dr Knight who kept a school there for about forty boys. He disfigured the house by plastering over the carved ceilings and painting the oak panelled wainscots, but this was later reinstated in its original style by the 1st Viscount Long. Lord Long's initials, WHL, can be seen on many properties in the village but he never lived there. Throughout the rest of the 19th century the house was lived in by caretakers. The manor was retained by the family and tenanted after the rest of the South Wraxall estate (including the majority of property in the village) was sold on 20 May 1919. In 1935, after the death of the tenant, the house was taken over by the 2nd Viscount Long who undertook further restoration; by then the former principal residence of the family at Rood Ashton had been sold. During the Second World War the manor housed evacuees from Kent, and was used as a convalescent home for children. In the 1950s it was occupied by the 2nd Viscount's sister-in-law Anne, who was married to Lord Rothermere. (Anne later divorced Rothermere, to marry Ian Fleming). The last member of the Long family to live at the manor was Sara, the only daughter of the 2nd Viscount Long, and wife of Conservative MP, Charles Morrison. The house was sold in 1966, together with , after five hundred years of family ownership.  Recent history  The house was recorded as Grade I listed in 1962, as was Manor Farmhouse. The 18th-century gatepiers at the south entrance were Grade II listed in 1988. John Taylor (bass player with the band Duran Duran) and his wife Gela Nash-Taylor (co-founder of Juicy Couture) purchased the house in 2005 and live there when Taylor's band is working in England. Publication The Country House Revealed, a 2011 BBC TV series, featured the house in episode 1. The series was accompanied by an illustrated book with a chapter on the Manor.

Mills Observatory Dundee, Leisure & Culture Dundee, 2014 Built in 1935, the observatory is classically styled in sandstone and has a distinctive 7 m dome, which houses a Victorian refracting telescope, a small planetarium, and display areas. The dome is one of two made from papier-m√¢ch√© to survive in the UK, the other being at the Godlee Observatory. Telescopes The main telescope is a 400mm (16inch) Dobsonian reflector that was acquired in 2013. The observatory also houses a Victorian 0.25m (10 inch) Cooke refractor, with a focal length of 3.75 m. It was made in York in 1871 by Thomas Cooke and the optical components are of the highest quality. The telescope is actually older than the building. The dome also houses a 0.3m (12 inch) Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, which was purchased in 2006. When the Mills Observatory opened on 28 October 1935, it originally housed a 450mm (18 inch) reflecting telescope, constructed by the Newcastle based company of Grubb Parsons. The dome itself is made of papier-m√¢ch√© with a steel frame, and was also supplied by Grubb Parsons. Refracting telescopes have long been regarded as the superior instrument for planetary observing. During the winter evening hours, given clear sky conditions, the telescope is used to show the public the night sky. Planetarium The planetarium is based around a Viewlex Apollo projector, which simulates the night sky on a domed roof in a darkened room. Around 1000 stars are displayed, along with the naked eye planets and the Milky Way. Auxiliary units simulate a rotating galaxy, and provide pictures of astronomical objects. Seating is limited to 20 for public shows. Display Area The display area is split into two parts. The main area in the centre of the building at ground floor level provides changing displays of pictures and models, and also houses the observatory shop. The upper level provides displays of historic equipment and information of local importance. Balgay Hill Mills Observatory in Balgay Hill Mills Observatory is built upon the summit of the wooded Balgay Hill, in Balgay Park, one mile (1.6 km) west of Dundee City Centre. The woods of Balgay Hill, surrounding the Observatory include Cypresses, Redwoods, Cedars and Monkey Puzzles. Violets and Wild Strawberries can be found growing among the grass in season. Planet Trail Planet Trail On Balgay Hill, an outdoor planet trail, scale model of the solar system, is arranged to entertain and educate the exploring visitor. The planet trail is a series of standing stones and plaques representing the solar system. The visitor starts with the sun on the eastern summit of the Hill, and following the trail to the west from the Sun, in the direction of Mills Observatory, he or she will encounter another eight rocks representing the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Pluto is represented by the pier in the Mills Observatory, which supports the telescope there. History The history of the observatory starts with John Mills (1806‚Äì1889), a manufacturer of linen and twine in the city of Dundee, and a keen amateur astronomer. As a young man and a member of the Original Secession Kirk, he had been greatly influenced by the Reverend Thomas Dick, philosopher and author of a number of books on Astronomy and Christian Philosophy. Dr Dick attempted to harmonize science and religion, and believed that the greatness of God could best be appreciated by the study of astronomy, to which he devoted his life after a period as an ordained minister at Methven. He advocated that every city should have public parks, public libraries and a public observatory. Rev. Thomas Dick Mills built his own private observatory on the slopes of Dundee Law, near what is now Adelaide Place. An old print still exists showing the ruins of the building minus its dome. There would appear to have been, in addition to the main telescope, a transit room, and what was probably a study to record and write up his observations. The fact that he had a transit instrument signifies that he must have been doing timings of the passage of stars across the meridian, and was not just a casual observer. One of John Mills' telescope is on display in the Visitor Centre attached to the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. It is a brass instrument manufactured by George Lowden, a Dundee instrument-maker of that period, who supplied Mills with a number of his instruments.Flood, Thomas. The Mills Observatory : A Historical Survey, Mills Observatory Documents, 1985 John Mills When Dundee Town Council received the bequest they were in something of a quandary. There was no precedent for any bequest of this nature, and their first thought was to offer the money to the University College, Dundee, in the hope that they would be able to fulfil its terms. They, in turn, sought expert opinion from, among others, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, regarding the feasibility of such a project. The advice they received envisaged that only very limited public access would be possible. Evidently the College decided that the project did not fit into their plans, so they declined the offer. A Trust was then set up with the Town Council, and plans were drawn up to build the Observatory on the summit of Dundee Law. However, the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 put the whole project in pause, and the site it was intended to occupy was instead reserved for the War Memorial, which was erected after the end of hostilities. No further progress was made during the 1920s. The onset of the Depression in the 1930s caused the matter to be raised once again, since it was felt that the project would provide much-needed work for the depressed building industry. Professor Sampson, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, was brought in as consultant. After examining several sites he came down strongly in favour of Balgay Hill as being by far the most suitable site, both in terms of astronomical suitability and for public access. This decision has stood the test of time, since other observatories have had their seeing conditions ruined by sodium lighting and other forms of modern pollution. The concept of a public observatory is, in a way, a contradiction in terms, since by definition, an observatory should be as far away from the public as possible. Most of the modern research observatories are situated on mountain-tops or desert areas. However, the geography of Dundee is unique, in that it has Balgay Hill overlooking a river estuary, protected from the main lights of the city by trees which also help to provide a purer atmosphere, and at the same time very accessible to the public. Something like 40% of all nights are observable. The building of the present Mills Observatory Professor Sampson collaborated with James MacLellan Brown, the City Architect, in designing a much more modern building than the one originally planned before the war. The structure is of sandstone blocks quarried from Leoch, near Rosemill. The Observatory was formally opened by Professor Sampson on 28 October 1935, and presented to the Town Council by Mr. Milne of the Mills Trust in the presence of Lord Provost Buist. A message of congratulation was sent by the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, Sir H. Spencer Jones. Articles on current celestial objects were written in the local press by the Reverend John Lees, who usually acted as chairman at public lectures given at the Observatory by visiting astronomers. J. Grant Bruce The first Curator was J. Grant Bruce F.R.A.S., an instrument-maker from Newport, Fife. This was a part-time post, with a small salary. A full-time caretaker, George Dorward, was also appointed. Hours of opening were fixed, with special arrangements for visiting parties, and for qualified persons at other times. In the winter evenings, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays were for the public, with Tuesdays and Thursdays reserved for private booked parties. During the day and throughout the summer, visitors could view the scenery from the balcony, using two four-inch (102 mm) Turret telescopes by Ross, suitable for terrestrial viewing. These were excellent telescopes, also very suitable for wide-field, low-power astronomical work. Unfortunately these are no longer functioning and only parts of one remain. In the dome, the original telescope given by the Mills Trust was an 18-inch (45 cm.) Newtonian reflector by Grubb Parsons, electrically driven. The dome itself, also built by Grubb, is hand- operated and made of papier-m√¢ch√© on a framework of steel. The only part of the dome which has had to be replaced over the years is the shutter, where the papier-m√¢ch√© perished and marine plywood was substituted. The 18-inch telescope was rarely used at full aperture, due to its tendency to be affected by reflections from street lights caused by the open lattice-work tube. One of the problems that restricted the astronomical work of the Observatory during this period was that Balgay Park was enclosed, and the gates were locked at dusk. Special arrangements had to be made with the Parks Department to have a gatekeeper on duty during the nights when the telescope was in use, and for him to supervise entry and exit of public and cars, and ensure no-one was left in the park after the observatory was locked up. This meant that all children had to be accompanied by an adult. For this reason the Council placed the Observatory under the administrative control of the Parks Superintendent, under whom it remained until reorganisation brought a transfer to the Museums Department. The railings were removed during the War, since when the park has had \\"open access.\\" During the years 1935 to 1939 there was one staff change - Mr. Dorward retired and was succeeded by Mr. McDonald. Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War the Observatory was closed for the duration and the staff re-deployed to work of more immediate national importance. After the war, when the Observatory re-opened, the telescope underwent a radical transformation. The 19-inch (48cm) pilot model telescope Professor E. Finlay Freundlich of St. Andrews University, together with his colleagues R. Waland, W. Threadgill and Curator Bruce, were planning the half-scale pilot model of the 37-inch (95 cm) Schmidt Cassegrain reflecting telescope now installed in the James Gregory building at St. Andrews. This was of a much more advanced design than the standard Schmidt telescopes then in use. The Americans were also working on a similar design and the St. Andrews team were keen to be the first to have it in operation. The problem was that they did not have a suitable mounting available in St. Andrews for the 19-inch (48 cm.) pilot model. They became interested in the Mills Observatory's Newtonian telescope as its mounting appeared ideally suited for their purpose. Permission was given by the Town Council for the Newtonian to be removed and the new instrument built in its place, on the assurance that: \\"this would give Dundee a much superior instrument for direct public observation as the pilot instrument would be left permanently mounted in Dundee and available for public use.\\" The Cooke refractor telescope During the next three years the telescope room was closed to the public while the work proceeded. Only the balcony was available and observations were carried out with small instruments. The telescope was completed in 1950 and described as \\"the first of its kind in the world.\\" Unfortunately, it was purely for photographic work, which rather contradicted the above assurance. However, matters took a different course. The expansion of the city north and west and the development of sodium and mercury street-lighting hampered the work of stellar photography, so in February, 1951 Bruce and Professor Freundlich suggested that the pilot telescope be transferred to St. Andrews University Observatory, eleven miles (18 km) to the south, for better conditions and proximity to the workshops. The Mills would then receive in exchange the 10-inch (25 cm.) Cooke refracting telescope formerly used as a student training instrument and now surplus to requirements. At first the Town Council refused, and there was much correspondence in the local press, and indignation among local amateurs, that the University should interfere with the affairs of a public institution. Professor W.H.M. Greaves, had succeeded Professor Sampson as Astronomer Royal for Scotland, was called upon to advise on the matter. In view of the scientific benefits of the move, and lack of interest shown by University College, Dundee, he recommended that the transfer take place. This was done at the University's expense, and on the understanding that the two telescopes were on mutual loan. The refractor had to be modified slightly to fit the Mills dome, and the dew-cap cannot safely be used. However, it proved to be a much superior instrument for public viewing than the old Newtonian reflector. Originally built in 1871 it was, at one time, privately owned by Walter Goodacre, president of the British Astronomical Association (B. A. A.), who lived in the village of Four Marks, near Winchester. The telescope was used there by many famous amateurs involved in the work of the B. A. A. and was always described by them as \\"the excellent 10-inch Cooke refractor\\". It is particularly good for observing fine lunar and planetary detail and although not basically designed for photographic work, the lens is so good that, with modern cameras, good photographs can be taken. The Observatory has also acquired a number of smaller telescopes over the years. 'Harry Ford'Ralph Allen Sampson Sometime after the Cooke telescope was installed, Curator Bruce died. In the autumn of 1952, the Observatory resumed its public functions under a new Curator, Jaroslav C√≠sa≈ô D. Sc., F.R.A.S., a research astronomer at St. Andrews Dr. C√≠sa≈ô, from Czechoslovakia, soon aroused interest by his popular courses in astronomy at the adult education classes and encouraged young amateurs, including a number who became active in the Dundee Astronomical Society (D. A . S.), which was formed a few years later. He and A.S. Dow, Superintendent of the Parks Department, allowed the Society the use of the lecture-room of the Observatory for meetings. Dr. C√≠sa≈ô, because of his St. Andrews commitments, could only devote a limited time to working at the Mills Observatory. In view of this, one of the keenest of the local amateurs, Harry Ford, a technician at Queen's College, became his assistant, and acted as Curator in Dr. C√≠sa≈ô's absence. When eventually Dr. Cisar retired he recommended that Mr. Ford be appointed as his successor. This was agreed to by the Council so Ford took up his duties in 1967, first of all on a part-time basis, but eventually on a full-time contract. He was accordingly the first full-time Curator of the Mills Observatory in 1972. This meant that the Observatory could, for the first time, operate on a full-time basis. The D.A.S. became involved in work of the Observatory with the stimulation and encouragement given by Ford, who had inaugurated a programme for the instruction of the public using visual aids and experimental techniques. He also built up interest by excellent public relations work, so that the Observatory attracted attention throughout the world of amateur astronomy. A number of exhibitions and \\"Open Days\\" were held at which the work of the local amateurs was exhibited. Ford also organised displays of the work of the Observatory and the local Society at the B.A.A.‚Äôs Exhibition Meetings in London, which excited great interest among the assembled amateurs, and resulted in many of them making a special journey to Dundee during their holidays. Dr. Patrick Moore, well known TV and radio personality, praised the work of the Observatory as being \\"quite unique in his experience.\\" He himself has visited the Observatory on a number of occasions. The period from 1971 to 1977 was a particularly fruitful one in the history of the Observatory. This was the period of the great upsurge of interest due to the space spectaculars of the USSR and United States, culminating in the Apollo missions to the Moon. In July 1969, during the period of the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon, the Observatory witnessed the largest gathering of people in its history, when a colour TV was installed in the lecture-room giving full coverage of the mission, interspersed with talks, slide-shows, and an exhibition, stewarded by members of the D.A.S. Another significant event which stimulated local press interest was the expedition by Ford, Morgan Findlay and Dave Taylor to observe the 1973 total solar eclipse off the coast of Mauretania, as part of the B. A . A . organised cruise on the ship \\"Monte Umbe\\", covered for the B.B.C by Patrick Moore and shown on his \\"Sky at Night\\" programme on television. The photographs obtained as a result of this trip form an important part of the Observatory archives. In 1971, a meeting of Scottish astronomical societies was held in the Observatory, and a civic reception given to the delegates from all parts of Scotland. This was to be the first of a series of important meetings hosted by the Observatory. Possibly the greatest highlight of this entire period was the \\"Out of London\\" meeting of the B. A. A. held on 25 September 1975 at the University of Dundee, which was organised by Harry Ford and the D.A.S., followed by a public lecture at night given by Patrick Moore on the subject of Mars. This attracted such a wide interest that the hall was packed to overflowing and many had to be turned away. The Lunar Section of the B.A.A. met at the Mills Observatory on a number of occasions. At one such meeting in June 1972, Patrick Moore presented to the Observatory the original manuscript of Walter Goodacre‚Äôs observations of the Moon made with the refractor, when it was in his ownership, saying that it was only fitting that the manuscript should be where the telescope was. Harry Ford succeeded Patrick Moore as Director of the B.A.A. Lunar Section in 1976, with Findlay and Taylor as co-ordinators. Most of the work was carried out by local members of the Section, with the co-operation of the Museums Department. However, in November 1977, due to pressure of work, Ford resigned his Directorship. During this period also the public work of the Observatory received a great boost, with many more visitors and parties of children and adults. Particular use of the facilities was made by school classes and youth groups. Ford extended the Observatory's displays by construction of many models including various space- crafts. He was also responsible for an important addition to the Observatory's facilities, namely the 12-seat planetarium or artificial sky, which he built himself from various oddments, and which proved a great attraction in its own right, particularly for the younger visitors, and for school parties. Although it has now been supplemented by a commercially-made planetarium which can accommodate larger parties, Ford's original planetarium is still used regularly for small groups of visitors. Dick Kennedy, the longest-serving caretaker of the Observatory, who began after McDonald left in the 1950s and continued until his retirement in 1973. He was succeeded as caretaker by Jim Richardson, who retired the following year. From then on the post was combined with that of Assistant to the Curator, and Thomas Flood took over that position. In February 1982, due to domestic circumstances, Ford resigned from his post as Curator and moved south. During his period Thomas Flood served as the Curator, latterly re-designated as City Astronomer. Ford was succeeded in October of that year by the present City Astronomer, Dr. Fiona Vincent, a research astronomer from St. Andrews. Thomas Flood retired later that same year and Gary Hannan, A former member of the D.A.S., took over astronomer's Assistant in February 1983. Dr. Patrick Moore and Fiona Vincent The 1982‚Äì1983 season was memorable in that the D. A. S. Winter lectures included one by the current Director of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, and Astronomer Royal for Scotland, Malcolm Longair, a native of Dundee. Dr. Patrick Moore also paid another visit to the Observatory in connection h a highly successful meeting of Scottish societies affiliated to the B.A.A., hosted by the Dundee society - one of a continuing series of astronomical meetings held at the Observatory. The following year saw the inauguration of great changes at the Observatory, the net result of which improved the structure and facilities in a marked way the installation of central heating, the re-surfacing of the balcony, the general redecoration of the whole building, and the upgrading of the lecture-room to an audio-visual theatre with carpeted flooring. This, together with the development of the display area and sales section, was made possible by a grant from the Scottish Tourist Board, and meant the greatest upheaval since the Observatory was built. Despite this the work of the Observatory continued uninterrupted and indeed it hosted a record number of booked parties and casual visitors, a tribute to the efforts of the Astronomer and her Assistant. The social high point of 1984 for the Observatory occurred on June 21, with the official opening of the new improved facilities by Dr. Patrick Moore in the presence of the Lord Provost, civic dignitaries, the Curator of Museums, Adam Ritchie, members of the Museums staff and invited guests. In his speech Dr. Moore predicted that in the future, as in the past, the Mills Observatory would play a great part in the furtherance of amateur astronomy in Britain, and inspire some to take up astronomy as a career. =1986‚Äì2007= The Red Oak, planted on 25 February 2004 by H R H The Princess Royal to commemorate her visit to view the improvements to the Mills Observatory * The booklet The Mills Observatory -A Historical Survey by Thomas Flood was published in 1986, while Dr. Fiona Vincent was in charge. * Dr. Vincent resigned in 1989 and was succeeded by her assistant, Mr. Brian Kelly. * Mr. Kelly remained in post until 1999 when he resigned and the position was taken up by Mr Jeff Lashley, who remained in charge of the Observatory until November 2001. * Dr. Bill Samson took up the post of Heritage Officer (Mills Observatory) in February 2002 and became part- time Heritage Officer at the Mills in October 2004. * Mr. Ken Kennedy was employed to work on the winter evenings when Dr Samson was not in attendance at the observatory. * In 2003 the observatory was extensively refurbished with the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund.

It has an extensive collection related to P. T. Barnum and the history of Bridgeport, and is housed in a historic building on the National Register of Historic Places. Construction The building was originally contracted for construction by P. T. Barnum himself. The funds and land for the building and museum were provided by Barnum to house the work of the Bridgeport Scientific Society and the Fairfield County Historical Society. The structure was completed in 1893 and is home to The Barnum Museum today. The three story museum in downtown Bridgeport is constructed of stone and terra cotta with architectural influences ranging from Byzantine to Romanesque architecture. As designed, the building was to house the societies as noted above, with the first floor of the building holding commercial establishments. There is a frieze lining the top of the building by Henri Plasschaert that contains five reliefs of imagery from America's history. They are entitled \\"Native American (1670)\\", \\"Early Settler (1760)\\", \\"Maritime (1840)\\", \\"Civil War (1861)\\" and \\"Industrial Revolution (1870).\\" There are also busts interspersed among the relief panels of a Native American, Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Elias Howe, Civil War General Winfield Scott and Grover Cleveland. History Before his death, P. T. Barnum bequeathed the sum of US$100,000 for the establishment of the structure. Completed in 1893, the building was originally called The Barnum Institute of Science and History and opened on February 18 of that year. As imagined, it originally operated as a resource library and a lecture hall, attracting such luminaries as the Wright brothers and Thomas Edison to speak. Though designed to include them, no commercial properties ever occupied the first floor of the building. This led to financial instability in the original societies that resided in the building, as it was expected that income from those interests would help support the societies. With the onset of the depression, both societies faced fiscal hardship and were forced to cease operation. In 1933, the City of Bridgeport assumed ownership of the building. In 1936, the city opened the Barnum Museum. With the building in the hands of the city, it was closed in 1943 for remodeling. It reopened in 1946 as a city hall annex, with the third floor reserved for displaying selected collections from the now defunct societies. The building functioned in this capacity into the 1960s. In 1965, at the urging of concerned citizens and city officials, plans were set in motion to return the building to its former status as a museum. All city offices housed in the building were removed in 1965. Subsequent to this, the building was repaired and remodeled to support renewed operations as a museum. These efforts included creating spaces to feature exhibits on the history of Bridgeport and exhibits on the life of Barnum. When re-opened as the P. T. Barnum Museum in 1968, it was staffed by employees of the City of Bridgeport. In 1972, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. and Starting in 1986, the building was managed by The Barnum Museum Foundation. The foundation is a public-private interest group with the goal of maintaining The Barnum Museum. Renovations began in the same year, costing US$7.5 million Subsequent to renovations, the building was re-opened again in June 1989. New galleries were added detailing history related to the local industrial age and the life of P. T. Barnum. As part of the renovation, an . addition was made to the original building to house rotating exhibitions and events. It also included a recreation of P.T. Barnum's personal library in his former Iranistan estate and a number of other artifacts and displays of 19th Century life in Bridgeport. Also housed on the property was an exhibit devoted to Tom Thumb, one of P. T. Barnum's most famous acts. The oldest artifact owned by the museum is a 2500-year-old Egyptian mummy verified as authentic by Quinnipiac University personnel. Storms damaged many artifacts between 2010 and 2012. In 2016, the Barnum Museum, in partnership with the Bridgeport History Center (part of the Bridgeport Public Library) was awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to digitize a portion of their collections. The P.T. Barnum Digital Collection is hosted on the University of Connecticut's digital preservation platform, the Connecticut Digital Archive. This digital collection holds over 1,200 items that range from letters and ledgers to clothing worn by P.T. Barnum, Lavinia Warren, and Tom Thumb, as well as more unusual items such as a slice of fruitcake from the Warren's and Thumb's 1863 wedding. It also includes furniture from Barnum's Iranistan home that was previously displayed by the museum as a part of a recreation of his library, and a rare letterpress copybook of letters written by P.T. Barnum from 1845 to 1846 when he was touring Europe with Tom Thumb. The museum is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.

It was said to involve the now intangible Rimmer attempting to construct a body of his own using components of Lister's‚Äîsuch as hair.  History  \\"Bodysnatcher\\" was one of the scripts to be handed around during the interview process for the main casting, although at this point it was unnamed. This script allegedly caught the attention of Peter Ridsdale- Scott, the commissioner for BBC Manchester that he read on the train bound for BBC London. Alfred Molina and Alan Rickman, who were auditioning for Lister and Rimmer, performed their audition from this script. One of Cat's lines: > \\"I've eaten five times, I've slept six times, and I've made a lot of things > mine. Tomorrow, I'm gonna see if I can have sex with something!\\" was originally in this episode's script, but was moved to \\"Confidence and Paranoia\\" when the original script was dropped.  Inconsistencies  Because this script was conceptualised and part-written at a very early stage of development, many areas of the script do not gel with the other episodes of Series I. For example, the Cat does not speak to anyone but himself. The characters underwent minor development and back story elements were changed throughout Series I, and so the unnamed script would have had to undergo major changes to fit in with the rest of the series and the canon in general.  Deletion  The original series finale involved Lister resurrecting Kochanski's hologram from the projection disc he found with Confidence. However, when the unnamed script was dropped, \\"Me¬≤\\" was written to compensate for the missing episode and the ending of \\"Confidence and Paranoia\\" was similarly changed so that the disc in Kochanski's box was in fact Rimmer's.  Home video release  To headline the release of Red Dwarf Remastered on DVD in November 2007, the same audio story board process used in recreating the lost episode of Series VII, \\"Identity Within\\", was used to create the \\"Bodysnatcher\\" episode. When the script was retrieved from the vaults of Grant Naylor offices, it was found to be without an ending. The writers Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, who went their separate ways during pre-production on the ITV series The 10%ers in 1996, collaborated on bringing the script into line with the series' continuity and giving it an end. \\"Bodysnatcher\\" became the title feature of the DVD release, due in part to its name and the potentially misleading quality of the \\"remastered\\" moniker (as the remastering was done in 1998, not 2007). The DVD set was then entitled \\"Red Dwarf: The Bodysnatcher Collection\\". The episode was also included on the Blu-ray release of Red Dwarf I-VIII.

He is not to be confused with Giovanni Stradano or Jan Van der Straet (1523‚Äì1605), a Flanders-born artist active mainly in 16th-century Florence. Life and work Giovanni Stradone was born in Nola in 1911 as the son of da Luigi Stradone and Carmela Auletta. As a child he moved to Rome with his family. From an early age he studied at the studio of the painter Ferruccio Ferrazzi. He often visited the Galleria Borghese, which was located near his home. Here he copied the works of the old masters such as Raphael. After graduating from high school, he studied law following his parents' wishes but never worked in this field. At the same time he also developed a keen interest in entomology.Giovanni Stradone biography He frequented the Roman artistic community headed by Mario Mafai, Orfeo Tamburi, Corrado Cagli and Giovanni Omiccioli in the 1930s.Raffaele De Grada e Eugenio Riccomini, Mostra del rinnovamento dell'arte in Italia dal 1930 al 1945: Ferrara, Casa Romei, giugno-settembre 1960, Bologna, Alfa, 196 His first paintings date back to 1929. A youth friend of the artist is the protagonist in these works. In the 1930s his pictorial taste was in line with that of the so-called Scuola romana (Roman School of painting). His expressionist language gradually developed new and original features in the treatment of chromatic matter. In the 1940s he participated in many exhibitions and confirmed himself as a leading expressionist artist. At the end of the war he founded the group I quattro fuori strada along with the artists Toti Scialoja, Arnoldo Ciarrocchi and Piero Sadun.Toti Scialoja at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection He submitted to the Venice Biennale of 1950 the painting L'apoteosi di Bartali, which created a scandal.L'apoteosi di Bartali The work represented the meeting, which actually took place, between Pope Pius XII and the famous Italian cyclists Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali, in the presence of numerous characters represented as caricatures, among whom many recognized Italian president Luigi Einaudi, politicians Giulio Andreotti and Giuseppe Saragat and cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster. The work was removed from the Biennale on the grounds it had violated the rule that works submitted to the exhibition should not have been exhibited before. The artist was rediscovered as a member of the Roman School. His last major exhibitions were held in between 1978 and 1981, shortly before his sudden death. Works Stradone was a figurative painter who worked in a personal expressionist style. From 1930 he approached the Roman school and took his main inspiration from the city of Rome or the hallucinated visions of war. He developed towards a gestural and material expressionism. After the sixties, his works continue to re-elaborate recurrent themes (series of cyclists, harlequins, Roman nocturnes and open up to fantastic and caricatural notations.Strad√≥ne, Giovanni at Treccani Works of the artist are in the collections of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome.

It has an urban population of 2,082 located at 3,359 meters; and a district of 5,334 people. Censos Nacionales 2007: XI de Poblaci√≥n y VI de Vivienda The district, located in the sub-basin of the Mara√±on River, has an area of 447.69 km¬≤, which represents 85% of the province. Chacas was founded in the 1570s, but it is known that the territory now covered by the province to which it belongs, together with the provinces of Huari and Carlos Ferm√≠n Fitzcarrald, are the most remote evidence of human presence in the Eastern Sierra Ancash, represented by the findings of caves and rock shelters prior to the Chavin culture. The ethnic group that was present in this place after the fall of the Chavin culture was the lordship of Huari. The city is characterized for having remained unchanged over the original Andean- Andalusian architecture, with narrow streets, houses adorned with double water carved balconies and gates, made by craftsmen Don Bosco, whom Fr. Ugo de Censi, Operation Mato Grosso (with Chacas as a hub) and italian residents for thirty years, took charge of rebuilding the shrine Mama Ashu and restoration of the baroque altarpiece dating from the 17th century. There is now developing artwork for export to Europe and the United States, in addition to the unique stained glass factory in South America, having played a vital role in the development of the city. During the festivities in honor of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, the bullfight and the Race To Tapes are held in the main square; has Mozo Danza ritual dance, Dance Cultural Heritage of the Nation and the Provincial Museum exhibits an extensive collection of pre- Columbian pieces.  Toponomy  There are two versions about the meaning of the name: * It comes from the Quechua word chaka that can be translated into Spanish as a bridge, for it is based on the argument that all roads in and out of people always crossing bridges. * It comes from the Quechua word chaga meaning Atalaya, on the basis that Chacas imedia of more than 6 pirushtus.  Geography  = Location = Chacas includes moderately steep hills of related agricultural uses. Yanarahu which makes a natural border between the provinces Carhuaz and Asunci√≥n Chacas district is located in the eastern slope of the White Mountains in the buffer zone of the Huascar√°n National Park. According to Javier Pulgar Vidal, the district includes the altitudinal Quechua, Suni or Jalca and Janca, and its elevation ranges from 2,800 meters in Upakasha, to 6,173 meters in the mountain Copa North. Chacas center is in the Quechua zone, where wheat ( Triticum spp.) and other cereals are grown. It is bordered to the northwest, west and southwest by the Carhuaz Province, to the north by the Acochaca District, to the northeast and east by the Carlos Ferm√≠n Fitzcarrald Province and to the southeast by the Huari Province. = Terrain = The town Chacas is located on a plateau consisting mostly of undulating dacite, rising from its lowest point in the town of Chucpin to 3000 m to 3560 m above sea level in Cochas. The terrain around this plateau, as in the province, is very rugged and mountainous. The terrain elevations are higher up on the west bank of the district to share the White Mountains with Carhuaz. The highest peaks are the Perlilla (5,586 m), located to the south east, Wakuy with 4,702 meters to the west and Copa (6,173 m). =Hydrography = The district hydrographic network consists of a set of rivers and streams that wash many geographical areas, and completing a map of water resources for the district, both for human consumption and for irrigation. As for the rivers, there are two main running through the district from south to north: The Gun River, which rises on the slopes of Perlilla S, and Chakapata river, which rises on the slopes of the Ulta W. These channels are fed by 35 streams along its route to its junction Puruytumaq where the river takes the name of Aquchaka. The most important streams are used by towns to ensure water supplies for irrigation and human consumption are: to the east, Rayan, west and south the Camchas the Juitush. The district has 32 lakes, only one has been dammed for the purpose of human consumption, Patarqucha. The major gaps are: Libron and Cancaraca west, south, and Patarqucha Pagarisha, east Wakuyqucha and Ventanilla. =Climate = The district area has a diverse range of microclimate. These will vary according to altitude, latitude and other factors. Because of its location (puna low) and being close to tropical, presents a stark contrast of temperatures 24 hours a day. For example, on a clear day (July) temperatures range between 10 ¬∞ and 30 ¬∞Celsius, while night temperatures range from -3 ¬∞ to 10 ¬∞Celsius.  History  = Beginnings = According to the theory of Julio C. Tello, the first settlers of this region were the Waris, from Central America arrived by way of the jungle and populated the South American continent. = Chavin influence = There is evidence that Chav√≠n has been the cultural center of Wari in the north, as was Tiwanaku in the south. Therefore, the Chavin culture in those times influenced throughout Ancash. The disintegration of the powerful Wari empire, different nations united by raza, language, customs, religion, organized themselves into kingdoms was a time of war between these groups, which turned into surrender in small towns to large estates, so formed the nation of the Conchucos, composed of numerous tribes in the territory now occupied by the provinces Huari, Antonio Raimondi, Fitzcarraldo, Asunci√≥n, Pomabamba, Mariscal Luzuriaga, Sihuas, Corongo, Pallasca. = Presence and cultural Pashash = Between the years 100 to 1000 AD, Pashash culture developed in the northern Sierra de Ancash (Cabana) and projected towards the center and south of the same department. It is called Recuay culture (Pashash-Recuay) the late development of Pashash culture (500-1000 AD), it is noteworthy that before being hit by Pashash-Recuay, already living in those places small agricultural towns of rural life and manufacturing ceramics simple. = Inca Period = Between the years 1000 to 1470 was the time of the stately formations late late or regional states, which also had demonstrations in the territories of the province Asunci√≥n today. Chacas (provincial capital) was one of the lordships of the kingdom of Conchucos (on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Blanca), which flourished until the Inca domination. Inca domination was between 1460 and 1533. The kingdoms of Huaylas (western slope of the Cordillera Blanca) and were incorporated into Tawantinsuyu Conchucos, after a bloody invasion of the Inca Pachacuti, mission fulfilled his brother, General Qhapaq Yupanqui. That process of domination was incomplete, though it lasted 80 years, the Spanish set foot on this REGON when cuzque√±izaci√≥n process still was not finished. For this reason the Inca institutions not lay deep roots in the soil conchucano as illustrated by the Fr. Santiago M√°rquez. The abundance of pirushtus, which are defensive constructions parte4s raised in the higher hills, witnessed by the existence of antagonistic groups living and warring between themselves. There is evidence that the Incas failed to fully impose their culture, which explains differences in custom, religion and language of Ancash with respect to Cuzco. = Colonial Period = Balconies renewed by Italian Don Bosco artists in Jir√≥n Lima The people of the eastern highlands of Ancash would have submitted, with little resistance to the invaders, in order to get rid of the Incas. Chacas Foundation The first Spanish settlement, which was an Indian Reduction was founded between 1575 and 1578 approximately. They found was standard in the cities of the colonized territories imposing the place name, the name of a saint, under whose protection and devotion by the foundation. He was appointed Reducci√≥n Indigena de San Martin I Papa de Chacas, and that these lands belonged to the realm of Native Chagas, of those who come from other lineages: Janampa, Llashaq, Mallki, Rupay and Waraq. The foundation of this reduction is attributed to Indian evangelists Augustinians, they arrived with Spanish and Creole families began to settle around the chapel of Pope St. Martin I to exploit mineral deposits in the surrounding areas. Probably the official founding of the town were the Augustinian religious Hernan Garcia and Alfonso Espinoza. When Toribio of Mogrovejo visited the town of Chacas for the second time in 1594, he assigned a stable tributary population of 154 natives and, as the head of doctrine, a population of 552 natives. This appears in two of the pages written by the clerk Hernando de Mori during his stay in the town of San Luis, which were later attached to the diary of the second visit of the archbishop. f. 110 ... the same way the Indians gave the people of the next memory Chacas: 154 tributary Indians, 33 Indians reserved, 298 confession, 552 animas between small and large, as it seems and has all the memory that relationship. f. 108v ... In the villages and parts are referred to two doctrines and put them two priests in the following form, in the village of Chacas and in the mill of the lawyer Diego Alvarez and Juan Melgarejo's stay is a priest with the synod and salary following: the mill tested three hundred pesos. ... There are cures for these two doctrines Fr. Francisco Diaz de Lugo, who is in San Luis, and Martin Perez in the mill and the town of Chacas. During the viceroyalty, Chacas first belonged to the Archbishopric of Lima since 1774 from step to the jurisdiction of the commissariat of Tarma. He became an outstanding thanks to mining center in the hills surrounding were discovered rich veins of silver that soon were worked by the Spanish and immigrants from other countries as evidenced by the different mills whose ruins remain today showing ditches characteristics and stone mills, these mills or mills were major: San Jos√© de Mushuqmarka: Founded in 1716, it was the largest mill of the present territory of Asunci√≥n for 60 years, owned by Captain Juan Tafur mining of Cordova, which operated mines of Caxavilca, Kellayruna, Chucpin, Huiro and others founded the chaplaincy of Mushuqmarka in 1718, before Don Gabriel Mechado de Castro, chief justice and lieutenant-general of the Province of Conchucos, awarding of the said goods grinding mill metals to their alfalfa and grain mill mol. Because of its importance, the mill was visited by several officials of the viceroyalty during operation, in 1739, after the death of John Tafur, the Commissioner of the Inquisition and General of Cavalry of the then province of Conchucos Aciego Miguel Gonzales of the visit on behalf of the Royal Audience of Lima to conduct any investigation in between the heirs in 1743, the mayor, general and Justice High Felipe Osorio de Los Rios, ingenuity comes to inventory, property and give possession of the chaplaincy to Don Joaquin de la Cerna, in 1763, the captain general, mayor, chief justice, judge of goods and departed, mayor of mines and records of the province of Conchucos, Juan de Leon and Mendoza arrives to comply will among other things relating to the construction of the altarpiece in Chacas, livestock in the highlands of Juitush and their land in Chacabamba and Chucp√≠n. In his will, Juan Tafur of Cordova ordered to be built an altar in the Church of Chacas to move to the virgin of his chaplaincy in Mushojmarca. Virgin of Assumption remained in the ingenio Mushojmarca of the 1700. Ingenio of Virgin of the Immaculate Conception of Tumac: Owned by mining azoguero Claudio Mosquera, whose descendants acquired property Francisco Giron de Cabrera and whose possession is effective for real provision mandate in 1715 with the obligation to work and pay the royal fifths His Majesty the King. Ingenio of Santa Catalina with Huancachay: Owned mining Sergeant Don Miguel Rincon Rodriguez and exploiting mine and San Antonio Huamana of Apash. This mill was operational until the Republican era, as Antonio Raimondi visited him in 1860. Included in its work and its mineral riches Ancash (1870) There are also signs of other mills that were located in the Ruriqucha gorge, which were treated minerals: Punta Diamante and Santa Barbara. This corresponds Estap√© mining boom Chacas temple, which was declared National Historical Monument 9373 by act of Congress of September 15, 1941. The chronicles of the time reflected the diverse testimony concerning Chacas received visits by officials of the viceregal government: * In 1750, the Captain horses Felipe Gonzales de Cossio, sub-delegate for the hearing judge, land sale and composition of the province Huaylas and conchucos and whose initiative belongs much of the territorial limits currently in effect. * In 1773, holds the post of mayor and chief justice of the province of Conchucos Don Jose Taboada y Castillo, Colonel of the Regiment of Dragoons of Chacas. * In 1775 the Spanish nobleman Don Antonio Navarro Dosal married by citizen chacasina Manuel Menendez taking up residence in Chacas and was appointed Postmaster of the Provinces of Carlos F. Fitzcarrald, Huari and Asunci√≥n. The 17th and 18th centuries meant the consolidation and growth of the rule of Spain in Peru, but also its decline. The province does not escape this study context. The decline was not due to depletion of the mineral wealth of our territory, main economic activity of the Spanish in these lands. But, rather, the extermination of the native population, through the mita forced labor system in the mines, mills and encomiendas. Obligations imposed parallel to the Indians for the benefit of the commissioners and magistrates. All this contributed to the gradual settlement of Indigenous peoples and its social organization ayllus and during the years of entire families. = Independence = In 1780, the people of Piscobamba and Chacas staged rebellions, motivated by the ominous mandatory taxes that the Indians had to pay, in addition to the abuses of the chiefs and magistrates. Social movements were foreshadowing the colonial crisis and the advent of the Republic. Between 1819 and 1820, people continued to react and continued turmoil. The envoy, Saint Martin, Governor - Don Dionisio Vizcarra, swore independence in the main square of all the peoples of conchucos (starting with the people of Chacas). The people of Chacas supported with livestock and food for the support of the independence cause of liberating army. = Republican period = It was only after three decades of independence, giving rise to another historical period and readjustment of the population, until in 1853 the peace was interrupted by a tragedy of major proportions. The region and specifically the people of Chacas suffered the onset of epidemic typhus, spread around the Callej√≥n de Huaylas, reaching Corongo. The people of Chacas part of the province of Huari, created in 1834. The year was 1983, which raises the new province of Asunci√≥n in two districts: Chaco (provincial capital) and the District of Acochaca (Law No. 23 764)  Museum  The Museo de Sitio (museum) is in the Plaza de Armas of Chacas, where artifacts are collected and sorted, which include the remains of stone sculpture and pottery found in different parts of the province. The collection of ceramics, sculpture and other ancient artifacts had been gathered by the Provincial Municipality of Asunci√≥n (1997). Contains approximately 400 pieces, this is considered one of the largest Ancash. Chacas Museum is emerging as a cultural institution that brings alive the ancient culture and encourages tourism Chacas.  Legend  They say that the first people of Chacas was located at a place called Mushoj Brand (small town), a more or less than 2 miles from the present town, founded by the Spanish. The Virgin knew that later was to have a great and solemn festival, and people would be in danger due to the proximity of Mushoj mark to the torrents of the river Chucpin would be easily consumed by the effects of drink and disappear for a moment torrentes.Al forth between people over the years continued to grow and with it the dangers of living along a river, so the Virgin decided to seek a better place to welcome the faithful. Ashu call an old lady who lived on a plateau a mile from Mushoj Brand was given the surprise one morning strangely lukewarm among kenuales, kisuares bunch grass and is a beautiful lady She cleansed skin almost glowing snowy and delicate hands with a child on your lap, beside a small lake, the beautiful lady said that he wanted to build their temple at that place, every morning the virgin departed for the small lake after passing through the crops of wheat and potato, took a short break in the rise of Chucpin, at a place called Mamita Hamana (¬® where the Virgin sat ¬®), at dusk each day, the Virgin was found in the lake for the residents of Mushoj Brand after learning by Ashu through the virgin pastorsita wanted a temple at that place, drained the small lake on his bed, laid the foundation for the temple, naming the end, Mama Ashu the Virgin in honor Ashu perhaps the shepherd.  Operation Mato Grosso  The founder of Operation Mato Grosso is Fr. Hugo Censi, true architect of this humanitarian work. The life of Fr. Hugo and his sacrifice was intense, therefore he was given a lot of affection and is an example that affects many young people who want to follow. There is already more than 2,500 volunteers in Italy and 300 permanent volunteers in South America. Contributors The whole movement is based on two pillars: * A group of volunteers based in South America, who are already over 300, which develops educational level tasks and selfless help to the neediest of the place. * Groups of volunteers to help from their country of origin. The partners take actions to raise funds and school supplies to be sent to areas where volunteers do their work. The origin of the organization is Italian and, indeed, Italy offers the greatest strength of employees once they reach a number higher than 2,500. In Spain, in 2002, created a partnership formed by two small groups of collaborators, one in Madrid and one in Puerto Hurraco (Badajoz), who claim to be the seed of a greater force to bring prosperity to get the most impoverished South. = Father Ugo de Censi = It is difficult to describe in words Fr. Ugo De Censi. It is difficult to understand, only words, his love, his devotion, his total dedication to the young and the poor, then try to talk about it for one of his letters. \\"When I go among the poor of Peru, asked the Bishop of Huari assign me a parish located in one of the more remote valleys of the Andes.

Building insulation is low-thermal-conductivity material used to reduce building heat loss and gain and reduce noise transmission. Cellulose insulation is plant fiber used in wall and roof cavities to insulate, draught proof and reduce free noise.  History of cellulose insulation  Cellulose is among the oldest types of building insulation material. Many types of cellulosic materials have been used, including newspaper, cardboard, cotton, straw, sawdust, hemp and corncob. Monticello was insulated with a form of cellulose. Modern cellulose insulation, made with recycled newspaper using grinding and dust removing machines and adding a fire retardant, began in the 1950s and came into general use in the US during the 1970s The market for insulation increased following the oil embargo of 1973-74. The embargo caused energy costs for heating to skyrocket across the nation, which led to increased interest in energy conservation measures. Insulation gained significant national attention as a cheap and available technology to increase the energy efficiency of homes. In 1977, following a particularly severe winter, a tax credit was given for homeowners who installed insulation. While in 1976 there were roughly 100 cellulose insulation firms with 125 plants, by 1978 there were more than 350 firms with more than 500 plants1. Cellulose insulation was produced locally by small manufacturers who purchased ready-to-operate machines and offered a cheap and easy low-tech production process. Other than some constraints created by a shortage of boric acid for use as fire retardant, cellulose captured an increased share of the market due to lower costs and its suitability for retrofits. Meanwhile, fiberglass and rockwool producers found it difficult to keep up with the demand for insulation from their customers. Due to complaints by retailers, contractors and consumers about price, safety and quality control problems, the federal government began enacting insulation standards beginning in 1978. There was a great concern that the growth in cellulose manufactures was leading to improperly or insufficiently treating insulation against the threat of fire even though reliable statistics on a national basis did not exist. This led to the Federal Consumer Products Safety Commission passing 16 CFR Part 1209, which sets safety standards covering four product attributes for cellulose insulation only: settled density, corrosiveness, critical radiant flux and smoldering combustion. Another regulation passed was the ‚ÄúR-value Rule,‚Äù placing clear limitations on the claims that manufacturing and marketing firms can make about their product. The effect of regulations by the CPSC put most of the small producers of cellulose insulation out of business. The costs incurred by increasing fire testing made cellulose more expensive and the bad publicity helped decrease demand. They were either unable to meet the testing requirements or they merged with other small manufacturers. In 1985 the CPSC asked Congress to repeal the flammability standard after further studies. By 1991 only 61 cellulose producers still remained in the US.Cellulose Insulation Manufacturers Association, http://www.cellulose.org/ The fiberglass industry meanwhile benefited from most of the regulations passed by the federal government. The heavy lobbying by the more centralized fiberglass and mineral insulation manufacturers helped pass the tough fire standards for cellulose insulation. These standards were reinforced by technical bulletins published by the Mineral Insulation Manufacturers Association (currently known as the North American Insulation Manufacturers Association) that promoted fire hazard claims against cellulose insulation. These claims were not independently verified, faced little scientific review, or were purposefully misleading and untrue . Currently cellulose insulation has increased again in use in the United States. Part of the reason for this growth could be related to studies that suggest cellulose may actually protect a building from damage in a fire better than fiberglass because cellulose is denser and restricts the oxygen necessary to burn structural members. Several National Research Council Canada studiesFire Resistance Tests on Cellulose and Glass Fiber Insulated Wood Stud Shear Walls, Kodur, V.K.R.; Sultan, M.A.; Latour, J.C.; Leroux, P.; Monette, R.C., IRC-IR-806, , archive-backup Quote: \\"...Results from fire tests F21, F21A, F22A and F32 can be used to indicate the effect of insulation types on the fire resistance of load-bearing wood stud shear walls (see Figure 16). The failure of the glass fibre insulated wall assembly (F21 and F21A) occurred at 42 and 43 minutes respectively, while the failure of the rock fibre and cellulose insulated wall assemblies occurred at 54 and 51 minutes respectively. As shown in Figure 18, these results suggest that the use of cellulose fibre insulation provides a higher fire resistance compared to glass fibre insulation, but a lower fire resistance compared to rock fibre insulation...\\" have backed these claims. Another major reason for the comeback of cellulose might be because of the increased interest in green building. Cellulose has the highest recycled content of any insulation material and also has less embodied energy than fiberglass and other furnace-produced mineral insulation. Manufacture Cellulose insulation is often made by hammer milling waste newspaper. The newspaper is treated with chemicals, such as boric acid, to retard the spread of fire.  Products  Four major types of loose-fill cellulose products have been developed under a variety of brand names. These are generally characterized as dry cellulose, spray applied cellulose, stabilized cellulose, and low dust cellulose. These types are used in different parts of a building and for different reasons. = Dry cellulose (loose fill) = blowing equipment(Dry cellulose) Dry cellulose is used in retrofitting old homes by blowing the cellulose into holes drilled into the tops of the walls. It can also be blown into a new wall construction by using temporary retainers or netting that is clamped in place then removed once the cellulose has reached the appropriate density. This form of application does settle as much as 30%-40%. Look to the coverage chart on any product application instruction. R-value based on settled thickness. Use of given instruction charts are for estimating purposes only. Job conditions, application techniques and settings on equipment will influence actual coverage. Do not add water to this product. Due to variance in application moisture levels and temperatures cellulose will settle. Settling could leave gaps in a wall as the insulation compacts vertically, or it could leave space between a floor and the insulation beneath it. In addition, a dense-pack option can be used to reduce settling and further minimize air gaps. Dense- pack can only be done in a closed cavity by placing pressure on the cavity, and should be done only by an experienced installer. Loose fill in walls is an antiquated technique of using cellulose in wall cavities. The home performance industry and its accrediting bodies support the dense-pack standard of insulating wall cavities, which does not settle. This method stops the stack effect and convective loops in wall cavities. = Spray-applied cellulose (wet-spray cellulose) = Spray-applied cellulose is used for applying cellulose to new wall construction. The differences are the addition of water to the cellulose while spraying as well as adding some kind of moisture retardant such as chlorine to prevent mold cultures. In some cases the insulation might also mix in a very small percentage of adhesive or activate a dry adhesive present in the cellulose. Wet-spray allows application without the need for a temporary retainer. In addition, wet-spray allows for an even better seal of the insulated cavity against air infiltration and eliminates settling problems. Wet-spray installation requires that the wall be allowed to dry for a minimum of 24 hours (or until maximum of 25% moisture is reached) before being covered.ICC Legacy Report ER-2833 - Cocoon Thermal and Sound Insulation Products, ICC Evaluation Services, Inc., http://www.icc-es.org = Stabilized cellulose = Stabilized cellulose is used most often in attic/roof insulation. It is applied with a very small amount of water to activate an adhesive of some kind. This reduces settling and decreases the amount of cellulose needed. This can prove advantageous at reducing the overall weight of the product on the ceiling drywall helping prevent possible sag. This application is ideal for sloped roofs and has been approved for 5:12 (41.66%) slopes. = Low-dust cellulose = The last major type of cellulose insulation on the market is low-dust variety. Nuisance levels of dust are created during application of most types of dry insulation causing the need for simple dust masks to be worn during installation. This kind of cellulose has a small percentage of oil or similar dust dampener added. This may also be appropriate to homes where people are sensitive to newsprint or paper dust (though new dust will not be created after installation).  Advantages of cellulose insulation  = Thermal performance = The thermal performance of loose filled cellulose compares favourably to other types of low cost insulation, but is lower than that of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams. The thermal conductivity of loose-fill cellulose is approximately 40 mW/m¬∑K (R-value: metric R2.6 per 100 mm; imperial R3.8 per inch) which is about the same as or slightly better than glass wool or rock wool. This doesn‚Äôt represent the whole picture of thermal performance. Other important aspects are how well the building envelope is sealed from air infiltration, convective airflows, and thermal bridging. Cellulose is very good at fitting around items in walls like pipes and wiring, leaving few air pockets that can reduce the overall efficiency of the wall. Dense pack cellulose can seal walls from air infiltration while providing the density to limit convection, when installed properly. The University of Colorado School of Architecture and Planning did a study that compared two seemingly identical test structures, one insulated with cellulose and the other with fiberglass. The cellulose insulation lost 26.4% less heat energy over time compared to the fiberglass insulation. It also was shown to tighten the structure more than 30%.Second hand source: Energy conservation. Cellulose vs fiberglass. The Colorado Study, archive- backup Subsequent real world surveys have cellulose performing 20-30% better at reducing energy used for heating than fiberglass. Compared to closed cell, Polyurethane foam insulation (R=5.5 to 6.5 per inch), cellulose has a lower R-value per inch, but is much less expensive; foam has a higher cost per equivalent R-value. = Long-term cost savings = Annual savings from insulating vary widely and depend on several factors, including insulation thickness, original wall performance, local climate, heating/cooling use, airtightness of other building elements and so on. One installer claims cellulose insulation \\"can save homeowners 20 to 50 percent on their utility bills\\".HGTV Pro.com - Best Practices: Cellulose Insulation = Sound insulation = Insulation reduces sound travelling through walls and between floor levels. Cellulose provides mass and damping. This reduces noise in 2 ways, it reduces the lateral movement of sheetrock and attenuates the passage of sound along cavities. Cellulose is approximately three times denser than fiberglass, providing a slight improvement in sound reduction. = Mold and pest control = The borates in cellulose insulation provide added control against mold. Installations have shown that even several months of water saturation and improper installation did not result in mold.Cellulose insulation winning market share in Colorado, Built Green Colorado, Steve Andres, October 5, 2007 It is a common misconception that the mere presence of crude borates in cellulose insulation provides pest control properties to the product. While boric acid itself does kill self-grooming insects if ingested, it must be presented to an insect in both sufficient concentration and in an ingestible form in order to achieve insect fatality. Proper testing of products containing borates must be performed in order to determine whether dosage and presentation are sufficient to kill insects. Once tested, registration with the EPA as a pesticide is required before a product may be touted as having pesticidal capabilities in the US. = Fire retardation = The borate treatment also gives cellulose the highest (Class I) fire safety rating. Many cellulose companies use a blend of ammonium sulfate and borate. = Vapor barrier = A vapor barrier may not be needed with cellulose insulation. For example, recent studies have shown that air movement is the primary method by which excessive moisture can accumulate in mild marine climate such as Portland, OR, US.City of Portland Oregon, The Plans Examiner, March 2007 http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=149882 An insulation that fills the wall cavity completely (such as cellulose or foam) can help prevent moisture problems. Recommendations against using vapor barriers with cellulose insulation are supported by studies, even though they classify cellulose as vapor permeable.Applegate Insulation, letter on recommendation regarding vapor retarders, Advanced Fiber Technology, Summary of Vapor Barriers/Retarders, http://www.advancedfiber.com/AFT%20Summary%2001.pdf In addition, cellulose acts to distribute moisture throughout the cavity, preventing the buildup of moisture in one area and helping to dry the moisture more quickly. Cellulose manufacturers do not recommend the installation of a vapor barrier with cellulose.Green Fiber, Use of Vapor Retarders, Most US city codes will require a vapor barrier for any external wall. Most US cities will consider an appeal of the requirement if proper reasoning is provided. In March 2008 The US city of Portland, Oregon, approved an appeal to waive the requirement for a vapor barrier/retarder when using cellulose insulation. The appeal can be viewed in the Portland Bureau of Development Services search form by searching for appeal ID 4996. Fundamental to any appeal is mentioning that recent studies show air movement is the primary problem for vapor, that cellulose is an effective barrier to air movement, and that cellulose acts to diffuse vapor.  Disadvantages  The R-value of 3.6 to 3.8 per inch is good but not the best. Material cost per R-value is good but labor cost goes up because it takes more material and time to install than fiberglass insulation at the same R-Value . = Dust = Cellulose contains small particles which can be blown into the house through inadequate seals around fixtures or small holes.http://www.buzzle.com/articles/cellulose-insulation- problems.htmlhttps://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/st_rpts/tox074_rev.pdf = Installation expertise and building codes = In some areas it can be difficult to locate installers that are experienced with cellulose. An experienced installer understands how to correctly dense-pack loose fill dry cellulose, how to best apply stabilized (partly wet) cellulose on sloped surfaces, and the proper time required for wet-spray cellulose to dry. As with other non-batt insulation, US city and regional/state building codes may not be updated for cellulose insulation. Homeowners should call the city to verify that the insulation will be approved, and it may be necessary to provide product specifications to the city. This is not difficult, and the installer and the manufacturer should both be willing to handle this process, saving the homeowner any true effort. =Slumping= If improperly installed, loose fill cellulose could settle after application. In some situations this could leave areas of wall uninsulated. With correct training in installation methods and quality control techniques this is ruled out by installing to tested densities preventing any future settlement. = Weight = For a given R-value, loose cellulose weighs roughly three times as much per square foot as loose fiberglass.Weights of Building Materials Boise Cascade Engineered Wood Products Tech Note GE-1, p. 1, retrieved Sept. 17, 2010 Ceiling structures should be inspected for signs of weakness before choosing a material for insulating the ceilings of existing structures.How to Insulate a Ceiling Bonneville Power Administration, retrieved Sept. 17, 2010 =Offgassing= Many cellulose companies use a blend of ammonium sulfate and borate for fire retardation. Although ammonium sulfate is normally odorless, unexplained emission of ammonia and a resulting ammonia smell has been found in some cases.SCI Engineering Newsletter report =Mold= There is some evidence of increased mold infestation inside buildings insulated with wet spray dense pack cellulose especially when used with a vapor barrier. Environmental properties Insulation of any type helps make buildings more energy- efficient. Depending on the structure and manufacturer, using cellulose insulation could contribute to obtaining LEED credits from the US Green Building Council certification program.LEED. U.S. Green Building Council, 19 Nov. 2015. Web. = Recycled content = Cellulose is composed of 75-85% recycled paper fiber, usually post-consumer waste newsprint. The other 15% is a fire retardant such as boric acid or ammonium sulphate. Cellulose has the highest recycled content of any insulation available. For example, fiberglass has a maximum amount of 50% recycled content. = Low toxicity and environmental impact of raw materials = The non-recycled components of cellulose insulation are still environmentally preferable to the raw materials of foam insulation. Unlike foam insulations, many of which use HFC or HCFC blowing agents which have global warming potential higher than that of carbon dioxide, cellulose does not produce significant gaseous emissions. Toxicity of the raw materials of insulation types is typically highest during manufacture or installation. Neither is a significant issue with cellulose. OSHA states that cellulose is a dust nuisance, requiring a dust mask during installation. = Embodied energy = The embodied energy of cellulose insulation is the lowest of the popular insulation types. It requires 20 to 40 times as much energy to produce furnace-made insulation materials compared to cellulose. Cellulose is made by electrically powered machines while mineral insulation is made in fuel powered furnaces, reducing this advantage to a degree, as electricity generation is less than 50% efficient. Cellulose is made with locally available paper, while mineral insulation factories ship materials and products over greater distances. Cellulose insulation uses borates for fire retardation. Borates are a non-renewable mined product.

Generally the UAC/UVC (Umbilical Artery Catheter/Umbilical Vein Catheter) is used in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) as it provides quick access to the central circulation of premature infants. UAC/UVC lines can be placed at the time of birth and allow medical staff to quickly infuse fluids, inotropic drugs, and blood if required. It is sometimes used in term or near-term newborns in whom the umbilical cord stump is still connected to the circulatory system. Medications, fluids, and blood can be given through this catheter and it allows monitoring of blood gasses and withdrawing of blood samples. Complications include infection and thromboembolism. Transumbilical catheter intervention is also a method of gaining access to the heart, for example to surgically correct a patent ductus arteriosus. Umbilical arterial catheter The position of an umbilical arterial catheter is confirmed on plain film. From the umbilicus, the umbilical arterial catheter dives inferiorly and joins the right or left internal iliac artery before turning superiorly to the common iliac artery and aorta. Appropriate positioning of the catheter tip can be either 'high' or 'low.' The high range is judged relative to thoracic vertebra, and is between T6 and T10, to avoid major aortic branches. The low range is relative to lumbar vertebra, and is between L3 and L5. The lower position may be associated with a higher rate of vascular complications such as thrombosis or vasospasm. Umbilical venous catheter Anomalous positioning of the umbilical venous catheter occurs frequently because it is usually inserted without imaging guidance, and confirmed after placement on subsequent plain film, occurring in approximately 50% of first attempts. From the umbilical vein at the umbilicus, the catheter curves superiorly and to the right, joining the left portal vein, passing through the patent ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava and right atrium. Appropriate UVC tip position is in the high inferior vena cava to the low right atrium, typically within 1 cm of the diaphragm. If the UVC tip is proximal to ductus venosus it can lead to administration of intravenous fluids into the portal system, with potential portal vein thrombosis, or, in cases of TPN administration, a TPN abscess.

The Philistine captivity of the Ark was an episode described in the biblical history of the Israelites, in which the Ark of the covenant was in the possession of the Philistines, who had captured it after defeating the Israelites in a battle at a location between Eben-ezer, where the Israelites encamped, and Aphek (probably Antipatris), where the Philistines encamped. The ark narrative does not include any mention of Samuel; Bill Arnold suggests that it is \\"in order to celebrate the power of Yahweh's ark.\\"Bill T. Arnold, \\"Samuel, Books of\\" in Bill T. Arnold and Hugh G. M. Williamson (eds.), Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 867. Many scholars put 1 Samuel 4 - 6 together with 2 Samuel 6 and believe that it reflects an old source that was eventually incorporated into the History of David's Rise or into the later Deuteronomistic History.K. L. Sparks, \\"Ark of the Covenant\\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91. According to 1 Samuel 4, prior to the battle the Ark had been residing at the ancient sanctuary of Shiloh, but was brought out by the Israelites in hope of victory in the war. The Israelites suffered a significant defeat; Hophni and Phinehas, sons of the High Priest Eli, were killed and the ark was captured. The news of the ark's capture was such a shock to Eli that he fell off his chair and died, while Phinehas' wife died in childbirth as she heard the news, giving birth to Ichabod, whose name means \\"Where is the glory?\\" Robert Alter argues that 1 Samuel 4:22 should be translated as \\"Glory is exiled from Israel,\\" and that the story of the Philistine captivity of the ark is one of exile.Robert Alter, The David Story (New York: W. W. Norton, 2000), 26. Peter Leithart suggests that Israel deserved to go into exile, but the ark did so instead: \\"Yahweh went into exile, taking on the curse of the covenant for His people, and while in exile He fought for them and defeated the gods of Philistia.\\"Peter Leithart, A Son to Me: An Exposition of 1 & 2 Samuel (Moscow, Idaho: Canon Press, 2003), 56. Nicolas Poussin, The Plague of Ashdod. 1 Samuel 5 and 6 describe the Philistines as having to move the Ark to several parts of their territory, as tumours or hemorrhoids (\\"emerods\\") afflicted the people in each town to which it was taken: Ashdod, then Gath, then Ekron. The Septuagint adds that \\"mice sprang up in the midst of their country\\".1 Samuel 5:6 (Brenton Septuagint Translation) Stirrup points out that the \\"severity of the punishments increases through the passage\\": tumours in Ashdod (vv. 6-8), extensive tumours and panic in Gath, which had volunteered to take on the Ark (vv. 9,10a), and tumours on those who did not die and deathly panic in Ekron, which was 'volunteered' to take the Ark (vv. 10b-12).A. Stirrup, \\"'Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines?' The question of the ark narrative ,\\" Tyndale Bulletin, 51 [2000], 94. The text explicitly ascribes the plague to \\"Yahweh's hand\\" (1 Samuel 5:6). In Ashdod, when the Ark was placed in the temple of Dagon, the statue of Dagon was found prostrate in front of the Ark the next morning; after the statue of Dagon was restored to its place, it was again found prostrate the next morning, and this time its head and hands had also been broken off. Leithart provides a number of parallels between the Philistine captivity of the Ark and the Plagues of Egypt in the Book of Exodus. The ark brings about plagues, humbles the gods of the Philistines and returns full of treasure.Peter Leithart, A Son to Me, 57. In fact, the Philistine diviners refer to the events of the Exodus in 1 Samuel 6:6. On the advice of these diviners about how to end the plagues, the Philistines made a guilt offering of five golden tumors and five gold mice (representing the five Philistine rulers). They then placed the gold along with the ark on a cart drawn by two milch cows , who head straight for Israel and do not waver. The ark stops at Beth Shemesh before finding a more permanent home at Kiriath- Jearim.

Cooper, 1989) The Pathfinder, or The Inland Sea is a historical novel by James Fenimore Cooper, first published in 1840. It is the fourth novel Cooper wrote featuring Natty Bumppo, his fictitious frontier hero, and the third chronological episode of the Leatherstocking Tales. The inland sea of the title is Lake Ontario.  Composition  The Pathfinder was written 13 years after Natty Bumppo had ended his career in The Prairie. Cooper had questioned the wisdom of reviving this hero, and he was at the time engaged in fierce litigations with newspapers. The adventures of the plot on the water take authority from the fact that Cooper had as midshipman actually seen service on Lake Ontario.  Plot  The Pathfinder shows Natty at his old trick of guiding tender damsels through the dangerous woods, and the siege at the blockhouse and the storm on Lake Ontario are considerably like other of Cooper's sieges and storms. Natty, in this novel commonly called the Pathfinder, keeps in a hardy middle age his simple and honest nature, which is severely tested by his love for a nineteen year old young woman. She is a conventional heroine of romance. A certain soft amiability about her turns for a time all the thoughts of the scout to the world of domestic affections. More talkative than ever before, he reveals new mental and moral traits. With the same touch of realism which had kept Uncas and Cora apart in The Last of the Mohicans, Cooper separates these lovers, and sends Natty's romantic interest to the arms of a younger suitor, restoring the hero to his home in the wilderness.  Distinctions  It is the only book in the Leatherstocking series to show Natty Bumppo in love, and the first of Cooper's books which made important imaginative use of the Great Lakes.

The Slingbox Pro introduced a four input design, combining the capabilities of the AV and Tuner units while also allowing for the connection of high definition sources with the use of an accessory cable adding component and digital audio inputs. Third Generation - SOLO and PRO-HD In 2007, Sling introduced the Slingbox SOLO, a third generation box that was a \\"streamlined version of the Slingbox Pro\\".CNET, September 26, 2007. Sling Media Slingbox SOLO Review (Retrieved April 11, 2014) It provided a high quality standard definition video stream and a lower price point. This model was followed up in 2008 by the Slingbox PRO-HD, a high-end device that supported placeshifting HDTV (1080i) video and currently is the only Slingbox to include an ATSC tuner for over-the-air HDTV broadcasts.CNET, September 25, 2008.

Remanufactured and refurbished third-generation Slingboxes have been fixed as well. Fourth Generation - 350 and 500 In October 2012, Sling Media launched the Slingbox 350 and 500 to replace the Slingbox SOLO and PRO-HD. With the digital television transition in the United States, the desirability of a standard definition focused product no longer existed in Sling's main market. Therefore, both boxes include HDTV capability, though the ATSC digital tuner that was included in the PRO-HD was not included in either Slingbox. The Slingbox 350 is the base product, with one SD/HD audio-video input (composite or component) and an ethernet port to connect to the Internet. The Slingbox 500 was positioned as a platform for next-generation Smart TV capabilities. In addition to placeshifting, the Slingbox 500 included streaming apps from Dish Digital, including Dishworld and Blockbuster On-Demand, as well as the ability to manage and view personal media, including video. The Slingbox 500 had Wi-Fi networking and HDMI passthrough capabilities. However, because of restrictive HDCP DRM, Sling still recommends that customers use component cables for placeshifting.Using an HDMI video source with the Slingbox 500 (Retrieved July 17, 2014) Fifth generation - Slingbox M1 In July 2014, Sling Media launched the award-winningGreenwald, Will.

The interface also provides recommendations based on aggregate viewing data, popularity and social activity. It was released in September 2014 to current Slingbox 500 customers. With the licensing of the Sling brand to Dish Network for the Sling Television OTT service, the SlingTV box reverted to the Slingbox 500 product name. =Other Hardware and Accessories= In 2008, Sling introduced the SlingCatcher, a hardware device to view content from a remote Slingbox, as well as personal media. The product garnered mixed reviews from its limited capabilities, including no support for HDTV, complex nature and its price.PC Mag, November 24, 2008. SlingCatcher Review & Rating (Retrieved April 13, 2014) Because early Slingboxes did not support Wi-Fi, connecting them to a network was difficult if a customer did not have an ethernet jack near their set top box.

However, the practice of placeshifting is not unlike that of timeshifting, which has been upheld in courts across the world due to the personal nature of a timeshifted rebroadcast, which is deemed \\"non-infringing fair use\\". Furthermore, Sling Media's technology limits access to a single authorized user, which prevents unauthorized or multi-user access thereby maintaining the personal nature of the placeshifted content. Broadcasting Ironically, given the controversy, the retail Slingbox hardware has found an unexpected niche market in television broadcasting. Broadcast engineers at several TV stations have installed them at remote \\"towercam\\" locations to observe traffic and weather conditions. KPIX-TV in San Francisco has several connected with wireless networking, using EV-DO via a cellular network (mobile phone) provider. This costs only a few hundred dollars for each site, versus well over ten thousand for a setup with a remote pickup unit and auxiliary broadcast licenses. However, the system is not yet reliable or broadband enough to handle live remote broadcasts.

M. Berger. Berger codes can detect all unidirectional errors. Unidirectional errors are errors that only flip ones into zeroes or only zeroes into ones, such as in asymmetric channels. The check bits of Berger codes are computed by counting all the zeroes in the information word, and expressing that number in natural binary. If the information word consists of n bits, then the Berger code needs k = \\\\lceil \\\\log_2 (n+1)\\\\rceil \\"check bits\\", giving a Berger code of length k+n. (In other words, the k check bits are enough to check up to n = 2^k - 1 information bits). Berger codes can detect any number of one-to-zero bit-flip errors, as long as no zero-to-one errors occurred in the same code word. Similarly, Berger codes can detect any number of zero-to-one bit-flip errors, as long as no one-to-zero bit-flip errors occur in the same code word. Berger codes cannot correct any error. Like all unidirectional error detecting codes, Berger codes can also be used in delay-insensitive circuits. Unidirectional error detection As stated above, Berger codes detect any number of unidirectional errors. For a given code word, if the only errors that have occurred are that some (or all) bits with value 1 have changed to value 0, then this transformation will be detected by the Berger code implementation. To understand why, consider that there are three such cases: # Some 1s bit in the information part of the code word have changed to 0s. # Some 1s bits in the check (or redundant) portion of the code word have changed to 0s. # Some 1s bits in both the information and check portions have changed to 0s. For case 1, the number of 0-valued bits in the information section will, by definition of the error, increase. Therefore, our Berger check code will be lower than the actual 0-bit-count for the data, and so the check will fail. For case 2, the number of 0-valued bits in the information section have stayed the same, but the value of the check data has changed. Since we know some 1s turned into 0s, but no 0s have turned into 1s (that's how we defined the error model in this case), the encoded binary value of the check data will go down (e.g., from binary 1011 to 1010, or to 1001, or 0011). Since the information data has stayed the same, it has the same number of zeros it did before, and that will no longer match the mutated check value. For case 3, where bits have changed in both the information and the check sections, notice that the number of zeros in the information section has gone up, as described for case 1, and the binary value stored in the check portion has gone down, as described for case 2. Therefore, there is no chance that the two will end up mutating in such a way as to become a different valid code word. A similar analysis can be performed, and is perfectly valid, in the case where the only errors that occur are that some 0-valued bits change to 1. Therefore, if all the errors that occur on a specific codeword all occur in the same direction, these errors will be detected. For the next code word being transmitted (for instance), the errors can go in the opposite direction, and they will still be detected, as long as they all go in the same direction as each other. Unidirectional errors are common in certain situations. For instance, in flash memory, bits can more easily be programmed to a 0 than can be reset to a 1. References * * Subhasish Mitra and Edward J.

Sokolov authored reference works on the stratigraphy of Eastern Europe, in particular the fossil coral records, and created the concept of Vendian period, currently recognized as largely overlapping, but not fully equivalent to Ediacaran. Biography Sokolov, the son of a village feldsher (medic), was born in Vyshny Volochyok. In 1931 he moved to Leningrad and became an apprentice electrician. A blue-collar work experience was a prerequisite for admission into the university. After a year of work Sokolov was allowed to enroll at the Department of Geology and Soil Sciences of Leningrad University. He graduated with honors in 1937 and remained there to take a course of postgraduate studies. Sokolov's early work concentrated on the stratigraphy of the Russian Platform, in particular the diagnostics of fossil corals for the identification of Carboniferous period deposits.Dobretsov et al. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II Sokolov was appointed to lead a Soviet field research company in China. After two years of field work in Tian Shan, the Turpan Depression and Tarim Basin (1941‚Äì1943) he returned to Soviet Central Asia to search for petroleum deposits on the northern side of Tian Shan. In 1945 he returned to Leningrad to complete his postgraduate thesis on Chaetetida, based on his pre-war studies. In 1950 he published Chaetetida of the Carboniferous Period, followed by five reference volumes of Paleozoan Tables (1951‚Äì1955). These works earned him his doctorate. A revised edition, included in the 16-volume Foundations of Paleontology, was awarded the State Prize for 1967.Dobretsov et al. In the early 1950s Sokolov joined a group of geologists tasked with the analysis of recent deep boring samples. Sokolov discovered what he believed was a hitherto unknown geographical layer preceding the Cambrian, which he called Vend (Vendian Period). The name Vend appeared in his papers from 1950; in 1952 academician Alexander Vinogradov endorsed Sokolov's theory and Vend appeared on Soviet geological charts as an independent period.Dobretsov et al. In 1958 Sokolov accepted an invitation to join the newly formed Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences as a corresponding member, and moved to Novosibirsk. Together with Vladimir Saks (1911‚Äì1979) Sokolov created a new Siberian school of stratigraphy and paleontology, which survived into the 21st century as the Institute of Oil and Gas Geology. Sokolov continued production of geological references, but eventually concentrated on his theory of the transition from Vendian (Ediacaran) biota to Cambrian, which he believed was critical to our understanding of evolution. He coined the Russian term for Precambrian Paleontology (–ü–∞–ª–µ–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –¥–æ–∫–µ–º–±—Ä–∏—è), which evolved into a separate branch of science.Dobretsov et al. Sokolov was elected to full membership of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1968, and headed the Department of Geology of the Academy from 1975 to 1987, the longest tenure since the establishment of the Department. He chaired the International Stratigraphic Commission and the International Paleontology Association from 1972 until his death, and the national Paleontological Society from 1974 until his death. In 1998 Sokolov became the first geologist to be awarded the Lomonosov Gold Medal.Dobretsov et al. Footnotes References * N. Dobretsov et al.

The organization began as Polyfidelitous Educational Products, officially founded in Eugene, Oregon, in the fall of 1984 by Ryam Nearing and her two male partners. They published the subscription-supported newsletter PEPtalk, and launched a series of casual get-togethers in their hometown for nonmonogamous people, which eventually expanded to include annual retreats at Harbin Hot Springs. After relocation to Captain Cook, Hawaii, the dissolution of the original triad, and conversion to polyamory, PEP was moved to Colorado. With encouragement from Robert Rimmer, author of The Harrad Experiment, and others attending the fall East Coast Conference in 1994, Nearing joined with Deborah Anapol of the pro-polyfidelity IntiNet Resource Center to form Loving More magazine and conferences. Nearing filed a trademark application for \\"Loving More\\" in 1998, and was granted the trademark in 1999. Anapol left the organization in 1996 to pursue other interests, including publishing one of the first books on polyamory, Love Without Limits. Mary Wolf took over as Managing Editor in 2001; in 2004, Robyn Trask became Managing Editor. Trask incorporated Loving More as a not-for- profit corporation, with the intent to eventually become a non-profit 501(c)3 charitable organization.

The School was now educating boys from the age of 3. In 2001 Yarm School became fully co-educational and was the first co-educational independent school in the North East. Many local independent schools followed suit. In 2006, the school expanded further with the acquisition of Raventhorpe Preparatory School which became the satellite feeder school Yarm at Raventhorpe. However, in January 2013 it was announced that Yarm at Raventhorpe would be closed. This is because the school was no longer financially viable, however all Yarm at Raventhorpe pupils were offered places at Yarm Preparatory School. In 2009 an ambitious ¬£20 million redevelopment plan won approval by Stockton Council - and with it, a potential boost to the Teesside economy. The School underwent significant developments in the years to follow, including new classrooms, improved dining and kitchen facilities, exceptional sporting facilities like a boat house and fitness suite, and a 750-seat auditorium. The school has received national acclaim for the new development from the Royal Institute of British Architects. R. Neville Tate was Headmaster of Yarm School until 1999 when David Dunn was newly appointed. Following 20 years in charge of this North East independent school, David Dunn stepped down in 2019 and Dr Huw Williams took on the position. The School now welcomes over 1,100 pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 and employs some 240 individuals. The standard class size in the Senior School is around 18-22 pupils. Sixth Form classes are closer to 10 students, which groups typically not exceeding 16 students. The School is arranged into four houses, each with its own housemaster or housemistress and tutor team. Houses compete at an inter-house level in sport and drama. The houses are named after prominent British saints associated with the North East of England: Aidan, Bede, Cuthbert and Oswald.Full View of Yarm. =School buildings= The school originated in the buildings which are now the Preparatory School, before moving into the current Friarage building when the older buildings became too small to accommodate the expanding pupil body. The Friarage building is a large Georgian manor house, that was built after the demolition of the Dominican Friary which had existed there from the 12th till the 16th century. Some parts of the old friary still survive - for example, the oldest building in Yarm is located on the school grounds - the Dovecote was originally part of the Dominican Friarage, and was built in the 12th century to provide a source of food for the monks. It is reputed that there is a tunnel from the haunted cellar of the Friarage to the Tees, as a way for the monks to get down to the river if necessary. However, no such tunnel has been found. The current Sixth Form common rooms are in the old Friarage stable block, which was built as part of the Georgian development - the original coach archways are still visible. In the 1990s, further expansion of the school resulted in the building of the 'Tate Building' for science and technology, named after the founding headmaster, R. Neville Tate. At the same time, the 'Hunt Building' for History, Geography and English was built, named after and opened by the former governor of the Falkland Islands, Sir Rex Hunt. In conjunction with the 'Hunt building' the school also opened a new theatre, which was opened by Lord Briggs. Since the school's expansion in 2009, this has been turned into the school refectory. In 2009, the School was granted permission to build ¬£20 million worth of new facilities to the schools existing site. Whilst there were wide-ranging developments to the Preparatory School such as the building of new multi use sports pitches and extending the schools pre-prep facilities, the majority of investment was on the School's main site by the river. This included the development of a new dining hall and construction of new class rooms alongside the riverside. The school invited Princess Alexandra to open its new, state of the art Auditorium. The school has received national acclaim for the new development from the Royal Institute of British Architects. The new development houses classrooms for English, Modern Languages and Economics.  Curriculum  The school teaches subjects towards the International General Certificate of Secondary Education and GCSE qualifications, including English and English Literature, Mathematics, Sciences (nearly all pupils study three sciences), and Languages (most pupils study French and German; Latin and Spanish is an option). Aside from compulsory subjects, students are able to study Humanities (including History, Geography and Classics etc.), Business Studies, Art and Design Technology. Some GCSEs can be studied outside of curriculum time, including General Studies and Russian. A-levels are taken in Humanities, sciences, creative arts and social sciences In 2012 the school was listed for A-levels, as the 20th most successful independent school in the country by The Independent. In 2019 Yarm School was recognised as the top performing school in Teesside and County Durham for its A-level results by The Gazette. Most pupils from Yarm go on to study at Russell Group universities, and in 2013 17 Upper Sixth students secured places at medical and dental schools, amounting to 20% of the cohort. Sports include rowing, rugby, cricket, hockey, netball, rounders, football and canoeing; partaking in sport is compulsory. Extra-curricular activities Pupils participate in activity sessions such as beekeeping, horseriding, rowing, debating, stock brooking and cricket, rugby and rowing, or continue academic study in Ancient Greek, Russian or general studies. In election years, such as 2010, the school holds a mock election, where pupils from Sixth Form politics classes acted as candidates representing the main British political parties. Similarly, in 2016, the school held a mock EU Referendum, with senior school, sixth form, and staff eligible to vote. The school voted to remain. Pupils help to raise money for their designated house charities. These charities can be local, national or international. Each house typically raises over ¬£2,000 per year through a variety of fundraising activities. =Sport= Most of the school's sports' pitches are located off the school site; Aislaby playing fields are located on the north side of the river near the village of Aislaby, whilst Green Lane (the larger set of pitches) are located on the outskirts of Yarm. Green Lane contains rugby pitches and a 1st XI cricket pitch. There are multi- weather playing fields for hockey and tennis located on site. Tennis, rugby, cricket and hockey are played as fixtures for the boys; tennis, netball, rounders and hockey are played as fixtures for the girls. There is emphasis on sport at Yarm; both boys and girls have a 'games' session each week in the senior school. In the Sixth Form, Mondays and Wednesdays are completely devoted to sport. Rugby and Hockey are compulsory for boys in the 1st to 3rd years, after which they continue only sports in which they show aptitude. Rowing is an option in 3rd year games, which can be continued throughout the rest of the pupil's school career. In 1991 Yarm won the Midland Bank (as it was at the time) National Schools Tennis completion, beating Millfield and Sevenoaks in the Semi-Finals and Finals respectively. In July 2009 a team of cyclists from the school won the over-16 category of the British Schools Cycling Association National Time Trial Championships. The school has a rugby tradition, and maintains links with the 'Yarm Old Boys' rugby team. On 23 March 2013 the 1st XV won the U18 Daily Mail Vase against Felsted School 17-15 at Twickenham. The school also has a competition boat club, the Yarm School Boat Club.\\"Yarm School BC\\", Britishrowing.org. Retrieved 1 May 2012 In 2009 it won 2 of the 32 categories in the Durham Regatta, and has performed successfully at the National Schools' Regatta, most recently in 2014 when the J15 1st8+ won bronze.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9SJjm3oxQdHeWVuSnMzaXFUcjA/view It has also been represented at Henley Royal Regatta. and has recently been to international events, such as Royal Canadian Henley Regatta and the Head of the Lagan in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It regularly produces high performance athletes, most notably Kat Copeland, Olympic Gold medallist. =Outdoor education= The school has an outdoor education department which organises games, activities and school expeditions. The department provides annual trips for 1st and 2nd years to the Lake District. During summer kayaking and canoeing takes place on the river. A winter option is climbing, with trips to nearby Scugdale and local indoor climbing walls. Expeditions have included those to Peru (2012) and Nepal. The school promotes the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, with most pupils undertaking the Bronze Award, and others continuing to Silver and Gold. This year 12 UVI formers took part in the Gold DofE programme. =Combined Cadet Force= The school Cadet Force Contingent includes two sections: Army and RAF. The Army section is attached to the Yorkshire Regiment, with whom it attends regular training, using facilities at nearby Catterick Garrison. The cadets learn military based skills such as climbing, abseiling, weapons training, orienteering and tactical assault simulation. There are a number of CCF Camps, Military Training Weekends and cadet competitions each year, during which the cadets go on field manoeuvres in order to apply the skills they have learned to a practical situation. The cadets represent Yarm School on Armistice Day on parade in Yarm High Street, in memory of the Boer War, First World War, Second World War and the Korean War. Yarm Town Hall and Cenotaph An Autumn term annual dinner is held for CCF staff members and cadets. Parents of cadets are invited to the dinner by the Contingent Commander. The dinner represents that of a military mess dinner. The RAF Section attends flying days to RAF Leeming for experience in flying the Grob Tutor plane. Cadets in the RAF section also attend Gliding events at bases such as Topcliffe, and Easter camps with RAF sections from other schools. The Contingent regularly participates in local competitions such as Colts Canter, The SAAM at Strensall and Tremlett Trophy. The CCF go on annual camps to different military locations, most recently to Munster, Germany in 2010, Crowborough in 2011 and Episkopi, Cyprus in 2013.  Awards and recognition  According to the Good Schools Guide, the school is \\"cheerful and welcoming\\" and is a balance of the \\"traditions of grammar School with modern, forward-thinking attitude\\". School pupils received a total of 1102.2 A/AS points per pupil and 242.8 A/AS points per entry in 2010. At GCSE, in 2010 28.2% of entries were A* and 60% of GCSE entries were either A* or A's. Houses and year groups The school is arranged into four houses, each with its own housemaster or housemistress and tutor team. Houses have their own colours, and compete at an inter house level in sport and drama. Each house is named after prominent British saints associated with the North East of England: Aidan, Bede, Cuthbert and Oswald. There are five Senior School year groups, plus a Lower and Upper Sixth. News In December 2006 two old Yarumians added a graffito of a penis on the roof of the Friarage building, which was recorded by Google Earth. The graffito has since been removed.

John J. Flournoy was born in 1808, living near Athens, Georgia throughout his life. Besides being deaf himself, Flournoy also suffered from occasional bouts of mental instability, and was frequently institutionalized.Coulter, E. Merton. John Jacobus Flournoy: Champion of the Common Man in the Ante-Bellum South. Georgia Historical Society, 1945, pg. 6. Flournoy proposed that deaf people obtain a government land grant to establish a colony \\"where all of its citizens would be deaf and the chief means of communication would be sign language.\\" Flournoy's proposals were not widely accepted even among deaf leaders of the day. Most argued that such a colony could not flourish because of the low percentage of deaf children born to deaf parents. Flournoy was also a driving force in the creation of the Georgia School for the Deaf and a proponent of a national college for the deaf. He also notably championed the expulsion of all African-American slaves from the United States on grounds of their supposed inferiority to the white race. Several letters from Flournoy to the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass were printed in the latter's paper, entitled The North Star. In these letters, Flournoy excoriated free blacks for their presumed arrogance to southern and northern whites, charging them with resistance to God's divine plan for the African race to remain inferior, and advising them to move permanently to the colony of Liberia.The Frederick Douglass Papers: 1842-1852.

History The school was founded as the Clay Street School in 1873 and was among the first public high schools for African Americans in Memphis. Green Polonius Hamilton was its principal. It was renamed Kortrecht High School in 1891. In 1926 a new building was constructed and the school was renamed in honor of American educator and civil rights leader Booker T. Washington. Further expansions were completed in the years since, including the Blair T. Hunt Gymnasium, dedicated in 1950. Race to the Top The school entered and won the 2011 Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, a competition that \\"invites public high schools across the country to demonstrate how their school best prepares [students] for college and a career.\\" Among the required application materials were student essays and videos that demonstrated the school's innovation in education. The accomplishments of the school included increasing graduation rates from 55% in 2007 to 82% in 2010 through the use of same-gender freshman classrooms and increased teacher effectiveness. BTW also suffered from and overcame high teen pregnancy and violence rates. The school beat out more than 450 other applicant schools, and as a reward for this achievement, President Barack Obama delivered the school's 2011 commencement speech.

The KBS is an affiliate member of the Blues Foundation. The Blues Foundation is a non-profit corporation headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The Foundation consists of more than 160 affiliated blues organizations and societies around the world and serves as the hub for the worldwide passion for blues music. Preservation Through extensive research and documentation, the KBS has made major inroads into the documentation of the blues tradition in Louisville, Kentucky. This research has led to the discovery of many rare photos, interviews, and the location of many early blues related sites. An archive has been established by the KBS to centrally locate all of these materials and make them available to members. They have also located the grave sites of blues greats Sylvester Weaver and \\"Little\\" Bill Gaither and arranged for the placement of headstones to preserve their memory. One of their most recent projects was the placement of a headstone for Louisville bluesman Foree Wells and his wife Lorene at Calvary Cemetery. Foree was a founding member of the KBS and of the Walnut Street Blues Band. He died in January 1997. In January 2007 his long-awaited album It's A New Day Brother! was finally released on Stackhouse Records with assistance and financial support of the KBS. Promotion From its inception the KBS has been actively involved on the local blues scene. Many local and regional talents have been showcased in local venues under either direct sponsorship or contributed support of the KBS. Such artists as Albert Collins, Pinetop Perkins, and Henry Townsend (musician) were all able to appear in Louisville under the auspices of the KBS. From 1988 through its demise in 1999, the KBS was involved in the festival formerly known as Garvin Gate Blues Festival - which was held the second weekend of October. Beginning in 1997 the festival was moved from the Garvin Gate Neighborhood of \\"Old Louisville\\" to Theatre Square. It was held in cooperation with The Louisville Palace, the Public Radio Partnership and the KBS. 2007 saw the rebirth of the Garvin Gate Blues Festival at its original location of Garvin Place and Oak Street. The KBS is also involved with several current local blues festivals including the Louisville Blues-n-Barbecue Festival held in mid July at the Water Tower on Louisville's riverfront and the Jeffersontown-Crusade Blues Festival held the third weekend in May at Veteran's Memorial Park. The KBS Unsigned Blues Talent Competition garners recognition for new bands and, due to its affiliation with The Blues Foundation, the winner is eligible to compete in the finals of the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee. The KBS contest is usually held in late summer or early fall at Stevie Ray's Blues Bar. Perpetuation Probably the strongest commitment that the KBS has is its efforts to perpetuate the blues tradition so that generations to come may be able to attain a knowledge and appreciation of the blues. In a way, this perpetuation encompasses the other two \\"p\\"s of the mission: it is through the preservation and presentation of the blues that we can begin to perpetuate it. One of the ways in which KBS perpetuates the blues is through the annual presentation of the Sylvester Weaver Award to an individual in recognition of their efforts in representing the mission of the KBS. Additionally, it seeks to perpetuate the blues with formal and informal presentations about the blues to various groups, and through sponsorship and presence at festivals and concerts. Monthly meetings The KBS Board meets the first Wednesday of each month at 7:00 pm. Any changes in location and/or time are announced in the newsletter and on the website (http://kbsblues.org/). All are invited to attend. Recently issued CDs are offered to members for review in the newsletter.

This commission was third in succession to the Mosaic Law and the gospel of Christ Jesus. He and his followers came to be known as Muggletonians, named after his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton. The pair saw themselves as the last prophets and the Two Witnesses foretold in the Book of Revelation chapter 11 verse 3. They are sometimes called ‚Äú the Staffordshire prophets‚Äù. Early life Reeve was born in Wiltshire. His father, Walter, was styled a gentleman but who fell on hard times. As a result, John and his elder brother, William, were apprenticed tailors in the City of London. William was Lodowicke Muggleton's first employer as a journeyman tailor. Mercurius Politicus (1653) says of John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton \\"only one works and that is Muggleton; the other (they say) writes Prophecies.\\"T. L. Underwood \\"The Acts of the Witnesses\\" New York: O. U. P. 1999 p 6-8. Mercurius Politicus was a semi-official weekly news magazine designed to promote in Parliament the views held by the Independents in the army. \\"A Transcendent Spiritual Treatise\\" A Transcendent Spiritual Treatise was the first Muggletonian book. It is written in the first person singular by Reeve but appears under the names of both Reeve and Muggleton as \\"the last true witnesses\\". The book was printed in 1652 with a second, slightly different, print-run the following year.It was reprinted in 1711, 1736, 1822 and 1857. Copies of the 1857 stock may still be available at www.gagebooks.com under their Muggletonian catalogue. The text is reproduced in T. L. Underwood Acts of the Witnesses p. 140 to 171. It is available in facsimile from Kessinger (2003) It could not be openly published since it could not be licensed.Rev Dr Alexander Gordon of Belfast Ancient & Modern Muggletonians Liverpool: privately printed 1870 p. 5 It purports to be a message from Christ Jesus to the elect by way of his last prophet and is a forerunner to God's reappearance in the skies above earth on the Day of Judgment. It announces Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton to be the last two witnesses \\"and suddenly after we have delivered this dreadful message, this God the man Jesus, will visibly appear to bear witness whether he sent us or not.\\"Underwood Acts of the Witnesses p. 21 The job of the two witnesses is to declare the mind of God. They are given a power to expound scripture beyond anything that has gone before. Anyone rejecting their commission commits the unforgivable sin against the Holy Ghost. The witnesses shall pronounce such a person cursed by God. The book then proceeds to a number of specific themes. * The Commission came in the early hours of 3, 4 and 5 February 1651 (Old Style)which is 14, 15 and 16 February 1652 by modern reckoning. In the old system, the year ended on the March quarter-day. Thus by Victorian times, Muggletonians were celebrating the anniversary of Reeve's experiences on Valentine's day. \\"by voice of words\\" from Christ Jesus. On the first morning, Reeve was told **\\"I have given thee understanding of my mind in the Scriptures above all men in the world\\" **\\"look into thy own body, there thou shalt see the Kingdom of Heaven and the Kingdom of Hell\\" **\\"I have chosen thee my last messenger for a great work unto this bloody unbelieving world. And I have given thee Lodowicke Muggleton to be thy mouth\\" **\\"I have put the two-edged sword of my spirit into thy mouth, that whoever I pronounce blessed through thy mouth, is blessed to eternity; and whoever I pronounce cursed through thy mouth, is cursed to eternity\\" On the second morning, he was told to go curse Thomas Tany. On the third morning, he was told to curse John Robins. * The Antichrist was identified as John Robins because he exalted himself in God's place.Although the participants remain resolutely silent about their Ranter past, it seems that both Reeve and Muggleton had, at some stage, come under the influence of Robins and that the new faith was their psychologically violent reaction against their own earlier involvement. John Robins was a wonder-worker who was imprisoned, recanted and, ultimately, freed by Oliver Cromwell. The address given in the preface of the Treatise for the author is the same address Laurence Clarkson was given three years earlier to seek out the libertarian Ranter group My One Flesh: \\"Mr Mellis, a brown baker, in Great Trinity Lane near the lower end of Bow Lane\\" Laurence Clarkson The Lost Sheep Found (1660) reprinted 1974 Exeter: The Rota/ University of Exeter p. 25. As the Treatise shows, a great deal of emphasis was originally given to the campaign to bring down Robins but, as time wore on and memories faded, the former association with Robins became embarrassing and dropped out of the picture. * Christ requires that men do not take up arms even though this had been lawful in the days of Moses. All vengeance is the Lord's and is reserved for Judgment Day when the bodies of the reprobate shall become their own hells. Then shall all natural light be snuffed out, to be replaced by the return of chaos just as, in the beginning, earth and water had existed as uncreated substances. The act of creation consisted of God giving form and life to the elements through his word and his breath. Humans differ from their Creator and they know this because they see the elect and the damned and understand that all this can only have come about as a result of God's sovereign power. * God is a spiritual person in the form of a man. The angels are spiritual beings given over to spiritual (and not carnal) desires. God is the object of the angels' desires and it was the deliberate withdrawal of divine satisfactions from the reprobate angel which caused him to fall back on his own resources and pride. No human has experience of such things as these. People can only penetrate the mysteries by the exercise of faith. God's kingdom will not come on this earth but will arise after the elevation of the elect to heaven in their new spiritual embodiment at the Day of Judgment: \\"Behold, I create all things new.\\" * The reprobate angel was created by God's will \\"to bring forth his seed, or generation of wise, and prudent, subtle serpent-men and women to oppose the Creator and his innocent seed.\\"T. L. Underwood Acts the Witnesses p. 150. Generally, Muggletonians reject an older Jewish notion that the reprobate angel is in opposition to mankind rather than to God and his role is to appear as a kind of prosecuting counsel against mankind before God. This view is very clearly expressed in the Book of Job, which is probably originally an Edomite story and accounts for Muggletonian suspicions of that book. \\"Woe be to the inhabitants of the earth for the devil is come down amongst you.\\"T. L. Underwood Acts of the Witnesses p. 151 Evil came to the earth because the serpent seduced Eve. Cain was born to perpetuate the devil's frustrated rage on this earth. Thus, there is no devil but that which dwells within the bodies of men and women. * There are signs that this process of evil is being reversedThe reversal of time back into eternity is an important Muggletonian idea and the turning point begins, not with the birth of Christ or with John Baptist but with Jeremiah and Ezekiel. such as Christ's coming as the second Adam and by the restoration of purity to his mother. \\"Eternity becomes time and time becomes eternity again.\\"T. L. Underwood Acts of the Witnesses p. 154 It is this process that comes to fulfillment in the \\"woman clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet\\" in Revelation 12:1. * \\"that the body or person of that Elijah was taken up and glorified in the Heavens by the Creator for that very purpose that he might represent the power of God the Father for that time or season\\"T. L. Underwood Acts of the Witnesses p. 157 when God was on earth. Because God shared an authentic mortal death, the elect are redeemed from their debt of sin. The meaningful trinity is not the one taught by the established churches but the one of water, blood and spirit which symbolises the three commissions. The established churches have no commission and continue to teach discredited laws. Inevitably, the outcome of their trinity is strife and confusion. * Body and soul are both mortal. Not until the Day of Judgment will the elect quicken to a glorious resurrection. * The civil authorities are due obedience in all matters other than matters of conscience. Establishing the Third Commission Reeve embarked upon his career as God's chosen prophet by issuing, in 1653, an eight-page pamphlet entitled A General Epistle from the Holy Spirit unto all prophets, ministers and speakers in the world. Reeve pronounced sentence of eternal damnation on two classes of people: those who heard of his commission but despised it, and those who continued to preach the message of the existing churches. Reeve says such ministers are not sent by God. They possess no commission and their opinions are merely their own. \\"You preach to the people out of the bottomless pit of your own lying imagination, which is the Devil.\\"John Reeve A General Epistle reprinted Clerkenwell: R. Brown (no date) p. 2 And perhaps more tellingly, \\"You know not the Lord Jesus who requires mercy and not sacrifice, who causeth the sun to shine upon the just and unjust.\\"John Reeve General Epistle p. 7 Reeve was beginning to tread on very dangerous ground. In 1656, James Nayler, a Quaker, was to be convicted of blasphemy after a trial before parliament. \\"After a debate which reveals the savagery of frightened men, Nayler was sentenced to be flogged, pilloried, branded, his tongue to be bored and then to be imprisoned indefinitely. This was milder punishment than many MPs wanted.\\"Christopher Hill God's Englishman: Oliver Cromwell and the English Revolution Harmondsworth:Penguin (1972) p. 176 Earlier, in 1653, Reeve's General Epistle was rapidly making enemies amongst those who supported Oliver Cromwell's policy of religious toleration as well as those bitterly opposed to it ‚Äì and for the same reason in both cases. What was the point, the argument ran, of granting toleration to minorities if they then used it as licence to vilify everyone else? Reeve was clearly impelled by a Godly imperative rather than political tact. Reeve and Muggleton were arrested under the Blasphemy Act 1650, the Transcendent Spiritual Treatise providing the evidence. Reeve was examined by the Lord Mayor of London, John Fowke, on three heads; self-deification, cursing Cromwell and denying the Trinity. Reeve denied all charges. \\"We own the Trinity more than any Men, both Father, Son and Spirit, are all one Person and one God Christ Jesus.\\"\\"The Acts of the Witnesses\\" p 70 A further charge brought by ministers outraged by the General Epistle was dropped, possibly because of the difficulty of framing a case, or possibly because the minister in attendance was from outside the jurisdiction.T. L. Underwood Acts of the Witnesses p. 69. At that time, law officers seem to have had difficulty reconciling Cromwell's Instrument of Government with unrepealed Acts of Parliament where these conflicted. In view of the Instrument, it was debatable whether the Blasphemy Act 1650 was still enforceable in cases like Reeve's. Magistrates possibly liked to skirt Cromwell's prerogative carefully. Cromwell was to press exactly this point to Parliament after the Nayler trial asking them by what power they acted, adding darkly, \\"for the case of James Nayler might happen to be your own case.\\" Reeve and Muggleton were remanded to Newgate prison to be tried by jury on 17 October 1653. They were convicted on a single count of denying the Trinity and sentenced to six months in Old Bridewell house of correction. During this period, Reeve's A Remonstrance from the Eternal God (effectively his appeal to Cromwell) was printed and published by Jeremiah Mount and well received. The pair were released in April 1654 to find they had a following. As a result, a number of important letters were written by Reeve during 1654, principally to Rev. William Sedgwick, an Anglican minister in Ely,T. L. Underwood Acts of the Witnesses gives his dates as 1610? ‚Äì 1663. to the Earl of Pembroke and to Isaac Pennington the younger.These letters, and one reply to Reeve, were published as John Reeve Sacred Remains Shoreditch: Joseph Frost (1856) On the face of it, Reeve's letter to these important persons were filled with failure. All three correspondents eventually preferred the Quaker viewpoint. Reading the letters one gets the impression Reeve doesn't much care. He's found the keystone belief for which he has long searched; universal mortality. People die, their souls die with them, the whole universe will soon expire and God has already died. Professor Lamont remarks that most of Reeve's contemporaries would have found this last item disturbingly blasphemous.William Lamont Last Witnesses p. 31 It was to provide the subject matter for Reeve's final book, Joyfull News from Heaven, or the Souls Mortality Proved. Reeve's health never recovered from his prison experiences.William Lamont. \\"Last Witnesses\\" Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing 2006 p 29 From this time, his wife and daughter provided the family livelihood.\\"Ancient & Modern Muggletonians\\" p9 But his wife died, probably on 29 March 1656. After this, Reeve was a pauper. But he had one great book left in him A Divine Looking-Glass (1656). At the opening of this book it says that all writings come \\"of divine inspiration or human imagination\\"Reeve & Muggleton \\"A Divine Looking-Glass\\" 5th Edition (1846) Clerkenwell: Catchpool & Trent p 1 So confident was Reeve that only the Commission of the Last Witnesses was of divine origin that he said in a letter of 15 August 1656 to Alice Webb \\"if the Lord Jesus does not bear witness unto our testimony and make it evident that he has sent us in a few months then you may conclude that there was never any true prophets .. \\" Reeve did not see himself as founding a faith so much as announcing imminent events to take place in the skies above London. The record of his prophetic experiences, as given in Lodowicke Muggleton's Acts of the Witnesses, is not naive reportage. Some of its embedded expectations are quite explicit, such as harking back to the Book of Revelation or to the clear parallels with Moses' taking on the first commission. Other references are meant to be felt more obliquely. We are told of Reeve's reluctance to assume his task, implying the matter derived from the will of God, not the pushiness of the prophet. We are told of Reeve's earlier experiences which he had interpreted as being for his personal benefit alone, thus implying he is an old hand who can be relied upon to evaluate such things correctly. The story is framed by the expectations of the times. Reeve died in July 1658 and was buried in the now-removed Bethlehem Burial Ground (the New Churchyard).This was on a site now occupied by the western end of the Circle & Metropolitan platforms at Liverpool Street tube station. Reevonians After Reeve's death, Lodowicke Muggleton became the leader of the group as the sole surviving prophet. It is generally agreed that Muggleton introduced one novelty into a faith largely of Reeve's devising. This was the principle that God took no notice of everyday doings in human affairs.The idea had originated with Laurence Clarkson. Not everyone was happy to accept this innovation. Some people didn't like it because it denied any personal relationship between believer and God. Others didn't like the way it left the prophet all-powerful with no possible appeal against his decisions. As a result, at all times in the faith's history, there have been those who felt they have more in common with Reeve and less in common with Lodowicke Muggleton. So, are there Reevonians? The relationship between Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton has been subject to considerable speculation from historians. William Lamont has argued that Muggleton had been the first to experience divine revelations and that Reeve was envious.Lamont, \\"The Muggletonians 1652‚Äì1979: A 'Vertical' Approach,\\" Past and Present, No. 99 (1983), 22‚Äì40. . Christopher Hill, on the other hand, has argued that Muggleton recast the events of 1651‚Äì52 after Reeve's death to put himself in a better light.Hill, \\"The Muggletonians,\\" Past and Present, No. 104 (1984), 153‚Äì59. . Alexander Gordon may have got nearer the mark with the simplest possible explanation. It was all down to differences of personality. Reeve was a somewhat hot-headed ideologue whereas Muggleton was content with the virtues of a quiet, still people. It might also be a matter of timing. Reeve lived six years in the faith; Muggleton 46 years. The faith had certainly started with the most urgent tidings of apocalypse. As time ticked by and the world remained stubbornly unchanging, something we might call \\"St Paul's syndrome\\" may have set in; making it necessary to accommodate this lengthening perspective. Had Reeve lived, he too would have faced the same adjustments, although that is not to say he would have chosen the same solution. In Reeve's last writings and letters he no longer mentions his fellow witness and his whole tone is of a man who feels himself alone and abandoned. Muggleton's own record of Reeve's death is respectful but detached. It is perhaps significant that whilst Muggleton took steps to look after those who had helped Reeve in his last yearsMuggleton organised a generous and discreet collection amongst the faithful to maintain Ann Cakebread and her family. She had been Reeve's helper. there is no suggestion there had been help to Reeve himself. Sources Modern knowledge of Reeve derives from three sources. Firstly and predominantly, from Muggleton's autobiographical testament \\"Acts of the Witnesses\\" although this was written long after Reeve's death. Secondly, Reeve's own letters and pamphlets in so far as copies survive in the Muggletonian archive. However, Alexander Delamaine's Great Book was not begun until 1682. The tone of these writings is often slanted by Reeve's urgent need for patronage and funds. Lastly, from contemporary commentators, although these may only be retelling gossip and hearsay. Unlike Muggleton, there is no pictorial likeness but Muggleton reports, \\"He had a fine head of hair, it was black, waving over his shoulders.\\"T. L. Underwood \\"The Acts of the Witnesses\\" p. 77 By no means all of Reeve's writings survive. Thomas Tomkinson quotes passages from Reeve which can no longer be traced.

Background Composer, arranger, band leader and multi-instrumentalist made his mark on Ghana's dance band highlife tradition in a variety of ways. Born in James Town, Accra,\\"King Bruce Profile\\", Ghanaweb. Gold Coast (present-day Ghana). Early life In secondary school, King encountered and learned principles of Western music as well as songs from other Ghanaian ethnic groups, especially Twi and Ewe. But his parents did not envisage a career in music and sent him for two years to London to study with an eye to a career in the civil service. There, however, King learned to play the trumpet. When he returned to Accra in 1951, he fell into the city's fledgling highlife scene and soon found himself playing in Teacher Lamptey's Accra Orchestra. The Black Beats The next year, King co-founded the group whose name, if not its membership, would remain with him all his life: the Black Beats. The name reflected a heartfelt loyalty to African rhythms and feelings in his then colonial context. However, the swing sounds coming out of the United States definitely qualified as African, and swing was an important element in the Black Beats' sound, which featured a strong vocal lineup. In 1961, nine Black Beats members defected to form the Ramblers, and King Bruce had to find new members. The new member were all young musicians - the most notable was a young trumpeter Anthony Foley from Mr Hammond's Brass Band. He became the lead trumpeter but later left for England. Other members of the group were Bengo Blay sax, Stanley Lokko sax, Jimi sax, Jerry Bampoe guitar. George Ofori and Quarcoo were vocals. Six years later, he was forced to choose between his semi-professional band and his civil service career. His pocketbook dictated the decision, and he handed off leadership of the band to another member. Union of Ghanaian musicians During the 1970s, King got involved in organizing unions of musicians. He would be involved with three during his life, notably the Musician's Union of Ghana (MUSIGA), formed in 1974, and still going today. In 1977, he retired from the civil service and returned to music. But his later years were most noteworthy for the work he did in teaching other musicians. King's house in James Town, Accra, became the home base for as many as seven bands, all of whom benefited from his experience, leadership and instruction. When he died in 1997, he left behind many prot√©g√©s, and his work will be felt in Ghana for years to come. John Collins and Banning Eyre wrote an article and biography on his life.

Perst for Java supports J2SE/ J2EE versions 1.3 and 1.4, as well as J2SE/J2EE version 5. It is compatible with the Android smartphone environment. Perst Lite is the Perst for Java implementation that runs on devices (such as BlackBerry smartphones) based on the Java ME (J2ME) mobile device platform. It has a memory footprint approximately 30 percent smaller than standard Perst.Databases for Java ME, part 2: Not just JavaDB but also Perst Lite, Terrence Barr‚Äôs blog on Java.Net. 12/7/2007 . Barr, a Sun Microsystems evangelist for Java ME, in this blog post and in a preceding one (Need A Database With Your Phone?, 9/5/20070 , describes the emerging demand for data management in applications that run on Java ME-based smartphones, and the handful of database systems available to satisfy this need. In detail =Size= The Perst engine‚Äôs size is 5,000 lines of source code, and its run time random-access memory (RAM) needs range from 30K to 300K.McObject releases Perst, an open source embedded database for Java. Java Developer‚Äôs Journal, 2/9/2006 ] =Transactions= Perst transactions support the ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) with automatic recovery. =Querying= Perst provides a subset of SQL for filtering elements of a container class. For access to stored objects, Perst implements specialized collection classes including: * B-tree indexes * R-tree indexes * In-memory database container classes based on T-trees * k-d tree indexes * Radix tree (Patricia trie) indexes * Time series class to deal efficiently with small fixed-size objects, such as stock quotes * Specialized versions of collections for thick indexes (indexes with many duplicates) and bit indexes (keys with a restricted number of possible values)McObject releases Perst vs. SQLite benchmark on Android. Dr. Dobb‚Äôs Journal, 1/2/2008 =Schema evolution= To facilitate changes to an existing database design (database schema), Perst implements ‚Äúlazy‚Äù database schema evolution. When an object instance is loaded from the database, its class descriptor is compared with the format of the class in the application. If they are not identical, and the object is to be changed, then the object is converted and stored in the new format. With an ‚Äúeager‚Äù schema evolution format changes would sweep through the database all at once. =Additional features= * Garbage collection * Multi-threaded * Support for Language Integrated Query (LINQ) eWeek‚Äôs Windows For Devices, 6/9/2008 * XML import/export utilities * Master/slave replication support, with the option to run read-only queries on slave nodes * Full text searchMcObject Released Perst 4.0, New Native Full- Text Search and More for Android.

He played college football at San Diego State University. Early years Saxon attended Arcardia High School, where he played as a wide receiver, defensive back and punter. He also practiced baseball. After graduation he moved on to Pasadena City College, punting for the 1980 Metropolitan Conference champion. He was a two-time All-Metro Conference selection. In 1982, he walked-on at San Diego State University and was named the starter at punter. He lost his job after struggling with his production, but regained it in the tenth game of the season against Brigham Young University, setting a school record with an 80-yard punt. He finished the year with a 41.8-yard punting average. As a senior, he set school records with a 45.5-yard season punting average and a 54.8-yard average in one game (against Brigham Young University). He received honorable-mention All-American and second-team All-WAC honors. He also left with the school record for best career average (44.1-yards). In 2018, he was inducted into the Pasadena City College Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =Detroit Lions= Saxon was selected by the Detroit Lions in the 11th round (300th overall) of the 1984 NFL Draft. He was also selected by the Arizona Wranglers in the 13th round (268th overall) of the 1984 USFL Draft. On August 27, he was waived after averaging 43.5-yards per game during the preseason and the team deciding to keep incumbent Mike Black. =Arizona Outlaws= On October 27, 1984, he signed with the Arizona Outlaws of the United States Football League. He was released on February 11, 1985. =Dallas Cowboys= In 1985, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. In the 1970s and early 1980s the Dallas Cowboys had the luxury that they didn't need to carry a punter on their roster, because quarterback Danny White could perform that role at a high level. In order to avoid a potential injury to White, the team kept searching for a replacement until finding Saxon. His first professional punt was a 57-yarder in the season opener against the Washington Redskins, in a game where he had an average of 48.8-√Ωards, a net average of 43.3-yards and placed 4 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. He finished with a 41.9-yard average, best by a Cowboy in 16 years and by a rookie in franchise history. He also set a franchise playoff record with a 46.9-yard average against the Los Angeles Rams. In 1986, he registered a 40.7-yard average, set a franchise record with 86 punts. He set a club record and led the league with 28 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. In 1987, he established himself as one of the best directional punters in the NFL, by leading the league for a second consecutive season with 20 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. In the season opener against the St. Louis Cardinals, he averaged 46-yards per punt, a net average of 40.5-yards had a career-long 63-yarder and placed 4 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. In 1988, he was fourth in the NFC with a 40.9-yard per punt average, was among the league leaders with 24 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line and became the second player in club history with over 300 career punts. In 1989, he tallied a 40.9-yard average and was among the league leaders with 19 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. He set the second longest streak in club history with 190 punts without a block. In 1990, he was second in the NFC, fourth in the league and fourth highest in club history, with a career best 43.2-yard average. He tied for fourth on the league with 20 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. In 1991, he had a 42.6-yard average and 16 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. He was second in the NFC and tied for fourth in the NFL with a net punting average of 36.8 yards. In 1992, he was fourth in the NFC with a 43-yard average (fifth in club history). He was a part of the winning team in Super Bowl XXVII, although he suffered a blocked punt in the game, ending a personal streak of 220 punts without a block. He also set the second longest streak in club history with 203 punts without a block. He played in 92 straight games. With 19 punts inside the 20 yard line, he set a club record with 166 career punts downed inside the opponent's 20, which at the time was the NFL-high since he came into the league in 1985. He set the franchise's career record in gross (41.5) and net (34.8) punting averages. He was the second player in franchise history to have two seasons with 43-yard or better gross punting average. In a total of 6 career postseason contests, he averaged 43.5 yards, ranking third in NFL playoff history. On July 7, 1993, he was released after the team decided to have a training camp battle with young punters, which was won by John Jett. He left with a streak of 92 straight games played. =New England Patriots= On July 26, 1993, he signed with the New England Patriots and won the starter job over Shawn McCarthy. He averaged 42.4 yards per punt and was named AFC special teams player for week 6, after his game against the Phoenix Cardinals. On August 20, 1994, he was released after the team decided to keep rookie Pat O'Neill. =Minnesota Vikings= On August 28, 1994, he was signed by the Minnesota Vikings to replace Harry Newsome. In his two years, he averaged 42.9 and 40.9 yards respectively. On August 26, 1996, he was cut in favor of Mitch Berger, who could also handle kickoffs.

As a B-17 navigator stationed in England, he flew missions over France and Germany. Hospitalized and then discharged from the Air Corps in 1944, Schueler moved to Los Angeles. In 1947 he taught English literature at the University of San Francisco and, increasingly interested in painting, enrolled under the G.I. Bill at the California School of Fine Arts (San Francisco Art Institute). From 1948-1951, he studied under such artists as Clyfford Still, Richard Diebenkorn, David Park, Hassel Smith, Edward Corbett, and met Mark Rothko.\\"To The Director of The California School of Fine Arts.\\" Edward and Rosamond Walling Tirana Corbett Papers, 1932‚Äì1978. The Smithsonian Institution American Archives of Art, Reel 4382. Film. In 1951 he followed his friend and mentor Clyfford Still to New York City where he was introduced to Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, and Ad Reinhardt. Schueler's first solo exhibition was held at the Stable Gallery in 1954. A second solo show at the legendary Leo Castelli Gallery in 1957 drew favorable reviews in the New York Times and Life Magazine. In September 1957, Schueler discovered the remote fishing village of Mallaig, Scotland. Inspired by the dramatic skies over the Sound of Sleat, he completed 45 paintings by March 1958 before traveling to Italy and France. In January 1959 Schueler returned to New York and exhibited at Leo Castelli Gallery and at the Stable Gallery in 1961 and 1963.\\"Exhibitions.\\" Jon Schueler Estate. Web. During the 1960s he was an instructor at Yale University's Norfolk Summer School (1960, 1961), a visiting artist at both Yale University School of Art (1960-62) and the Maryland Institute (1963-67), and then Head of Graduate and Undergraduate Painting and Sculpture at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1968-69). In 1970 he returned to Mallaig to live and periodically to accompany local fishermen out to sea. This experience brought into focus images of death, associated with the sea and sky, which had haunted him since the war. In 1971 he was interviewed by Films of Scotland for the film Jon Schueler: An Artist and His Vision (1972). He also developed friendships with poet Alastair Reid, artist Kenneth Dingwall, and art historian Magda Salvesen, who became \\"his muse and companion\\". In 1975 Schueler and Salvesen returned to New York for his solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art and joint exhibition with Mark Rothko and Milton Avery at the Cleveland Museum of Art. In 1976 he married Salvesen and remained in New York but continued to return to Mallaig to paint for three months each year. In 1981 Schueler painted in situ for six weeks during his solo exhibition The Search at Edinburgh University‚Äôs Talbot Rice Art Centre. Solo exhibitions of his work were also held in Edinburgh, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Chicago and, in New York, at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery in 1986, 1987, 1989, and 1991. On August 5, 1992, Schueler died in New York City. Since his death, Schueler's work continues to be exhibited in public and private galleries in Scotland, Australia, and America.

Like other artists searching \\"for the uniqueness of their souls on the canvas,\\" Schueler traveled to Europe where he discovered his imagined landscapes in Mallaig, Scotland. Back in New York in 1959, his memories of Mallaig took on mystical significance as \\"dimly recognizable forms of real landscapes with glimpses of the horizon and receding distances.\\"Schueler, Jon.

Friedman recalled that his work, now painted with brushes rather than palette knives, \\"contained a luminosity and a glow of radiant light not found previously.\\" In 1970 Schueler wrote that his painting \\"must be a search and a requiem\\" and his work began to reflect a \\"less tempestuous awareness of natural elements.\\" Art reviewer Janet McKenzie noted the influence of J. M. W. Turner and a \\"more poetic and elemental meaning\\" in his work as his wartime memories receded. In 1975 Whitney Museum of American Art director John I. H. Baur praised Schueler's work: \\"They strike a more precarious balance between observation and abstract form than do most paintings that try to wed the two....\\" Schueler himself commented in 1984: \\"The abstract is real and the real is abstract.\\" The palette in his later work varied from subtle and pale tones to vibrant, almost aggressive red, yellow, and black, which took on the fluidity or restlessness of ambient light.Balliett, Whitney. \\"City Voices: Jon Schueler and Magda Salvesen,\\" The New Yorker, 25 Feb. 1985, p. 35.

Life Cunigunde was the daughter of the Swabian count palatine Berchthold I. Her mother possibly was Gisela, a daughter of the Carolingian king Louis the German and his consort Emma of Altdorf. Cunigunde's brother Erchanger became Duke of Swabia in 915. Very little is known of her. She married first the Bavarian margrave Luitpold who became the ancestor of the Luitpolding dynasty. Her sons by him were Arnulf the Bad and Berthold, both ruling as Dukes of Bavaria later on. Luitpold was killed in the 907 Battle of Pressburg fighting against the Hungarian forces. According to the Annales Alamannici, Cunigunde married in 913 King Conrad I of Germany who was striving to strengthen the ties with the Bavarian stem duchy. The marriage left no male heirs; two children are assumed, both born 913: Herman, who died young, and Cunigunda, who married Werner of Worms and was possibly the mother of Conrad the Red, the founder of the Salian dynasty. First mentioned as queen consort in June 914, Cunigunde apparently did not play a significant political role while her son Arnulf remained in constant conflict with the king. In 915 she chose Lorsch Abbey as her burial place. King Conrad died in December 918 after a long illness, possibly by a heavy injury during a campaign against Arnulf of Bavaria. He was succeeded by the Saxon duke Henry the Fowler.

Club Cal Neva originally opened on April 2, 1962 as a club held by the gaming magnates of the time. It has avoided closure by changing hands and expanding into the sports betting industry. Its sports book was one of the most profitable in the state and racked in millions per year via satellite participants. In April 2011 William Hill PLC purchased Cal Neva's race and sportsbook division for a whopping $39 million. The Club Cal Neva is by no means a large casino but has expanded over the years. From 2002 to 2004, Club Cal Neva held a lease to the 16 story Virginian Tower which held 125 rooms, it was connected to the Club Cal Neva Casino, the owners declined to renew the lease in 2004 and the hotel was closed, it has not been reopened since October 23, 2004. That same year, Club Cal Neva purchased the old Nevadan tower across the street, it was once its own independent hotel and casino first opening in 1982 as the Onslow Hotel, it closed shortly thereafter and remained dormant until the owners of the Riverboat decided to merge it into their hotel and casino before it closed in 2001. It then sat empty before Club Cal Neva purchased it and poured thousands into a major refurbish. It remained Club Cal Neva's hotel until it was later sold to Siegel Suites on February 5, 2015. Other notable changes to Club Cal Neva, a parking garage was added in 1996 and more gaming space around this same time. Today, Club Cal Neva remains one of the last remaining of Reno's original casinos. It sponsors some Reno events, including the \\"La Tomatina en Reno,\\" an homage to the tomato fights in Spain. It drew a turnout of more than 10,000 people in its first run. Club Cal Neva also has 4 restaurants.

An illegitimate son of Antonio I of Monaco and the dancer √âlisabeth Dufort (named Bab√©), he was recognized by his father in 1715. The Chevalier de Grimaldi became governor-general of Monaco on 20 May 1732, when his brother-in-law Jacques I, Prince of Monaco and his young nephew Honor√© III, Prince of Monaco moved to H√¥tel Matignon in Paris and remained there, even after the proclamation in 1734 of Honor√© as Prince of Monaco. This situation remained the same for half a century until Antoine's death in 1784, when Honor√© III was already 64 years old. Antoine Grimaldi was an able regent. For example, he succeeded in keeping Monaco out of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748). He never married and died on 28 November 1784. His remains were moved in 1966 to the Apse of the Monaco Cathedral.

It can, but does not necessarily, have an opening to the skin surface, called a fistula. The cause is usually a developmental abnormality arising in the early prenatal period, typically failure of obliteration of the second, third, and fourth branchial cleft, i.e. failure of fusion of the second branchial arches and epicardial ridge in lower part of the neck. Branchial cleft cysts account for almost 20% of neck masses in children. Less commonly, the cysts can develop from the first, third, or fourth clefts, and their location and the location of associated fistulas differs accordingly. Symptoms Most branchial cleft cysts present in late childhood or early adulthood as a solitary, painless mass, which went previously unnoticed, that has now become infected (typically after an upper respiratory tract infection). Fistulas, if present, are asymptomatic until infection arises. Pathophysiology The pharyngeal arches as seen during embryonic development Branchial cleft cysts are remnants of embryonic development and result from a failure of obliteration of one of the branchial clefts, which are homologous to the structures in fish that develop into gills. =Pathology= The cyst wall is composed of squamous epithelium (90%), columnar cells with or without cilia, or a mixture of both, with lymphoid infiltrate, often with prominent germinal centers and few subcapsular lymph sinuses. The cyst is typically surrounded by lymphoid tissue that has attenuated or absent overlying epithelium due to inflammatory changes. The cyst may or may not contain granular and keratinaceous cellular debris. Cholesterol crystals may be found in the fluid extracted from a branchial cyst. Diagnosis The diagnosis of branchial cleft cysts is typically done clinically due to their relatively consistent location in the neck, typically anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. For masses presenting in adulthood, the presumption should be a malignancy until proven otherwise, since carcinomas of the tonsil, tongue base and thyroid may all present as cystic masses of the neck. Unlike a thyroglossal duct cyst, when swallowing, the mass should not move up or down. = Types = Bilateral branchial cleft sinuses during surgery.Four branchial clefts (also called \\"grooves\\") form during the development of a human embryo. The first cleft normally develops into the external auditory canal, but the remaining three arches are obliterated and have no persistent structures in normal development. Persistence or abnormal formation of these four clefts can all result in branchial cleft cysts which may or may not drain via sinus tracts. * First branchial cleft cysts account for 8% of the sinuses and cysts of the neck. The cysts are usually located in the front or behind the ears, lateral to the facial nerve, parallel to the external auditory canal. * Second branchial cleft cysts account for 90 to 95% of the neck cysts. It is located medial to the facial nerve, at the anterior neck, anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the hyoid bone. Skin pit can be found in this location. However, if skin pits are found on both sides of the neck, then, branchio-oto-renal syndrome should be ruled out. Infection of the cysts in this region can compress trachea, causing respiratory problems, or it can compress the oesophagus, causing dysphagia, and irritating the sternocleidomastoid muscle, causing torticollis. * Third and fourth branchial cleft cysts are rare, usually consisting of 2% of all branchial arch abnormalities, located below the second branchial arch. They usually have sinus tracts that start from the anterior neck at the thyroid gland until pyriform sinus posteriorly. If infected, it can cause acute infectious thyroiditis in children and if enlarge rapidly, can cause tracheal compression in children. Treatment Conservative (i.e. no treatment), or surgical excision. With surgical excision, recurrence is common, usually due to incomplete excision. Often, the tracts of the cyst will pass near important structures, such as the internal jugular vein, carotid artery, or facial nerve, making complete excision impractical due to the high risk of complications.

A subject's public key is reconstructed from the data in an implicit certificate, and is then said to be \\"implicitly\\" verified. Tampering with the certificate will result in the reconstructed public key being invalid, in the sense that it is infeasible to find the matching private key value, as would be required to make use of the tampered certificate. By comparison, traditional public-key certificates include a copy of the subject's public key, and a digital signature made by the issuing certificate authority (CA). The public key must be explicitly validated, by verifying the signature using the CA's public key. For the purposes of this article, such certificates will be called \\"explicit\\" certificates. Elliptic Curve Qu- Vanstone (ECQV) is one kind of implicit certificate scheme. It is described in the document Standards for Efficient Cryptography 4 (SEC4). This article will use ECQV as a concrete example to illustrate implicit certificates.  Comparison of ECQV with explicit certificates  Conventional explicit certificates are made up of three parts: subject identification data, a public key and a digital signature which binds the public key to the user‚Äôs identification data (ID). These are distinct data elements within the certificate, and contribute to the size of the certificate: for example, a standard X.509 certificate is on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits). An ECQV implicit certificate consists of identification data, and a single cryptographic value. This value, an elliptic curve point, combines the function of public key data and CA signature. ECQV implicit certificates can therefore be considerably smaller than explicit certificates, and so are useful in highly constrained environments such as Radio-frequency Identification RFID tags, where not a lot of memory or bandwidth is available. ECQV certificates are useful for any ECC scheme where the private and public keys are of the form ( d, dG ). This includes key agreement protocols such as ECDH and ECMQV, or signing algorithms such as ECDSA. The operation will fail if the certificate has been altered, as the reconstructed public key will be invalid. Reconstructing the public key is fast (a single point multiplication operation) compared to ECDSA signature verification. Comparison with ID- based cryptography Implicit certificates are not to be confused with identity-based cryptography. In ID-based schemes, the subject's identity itself is used to derive their public key; there is no 'certificate' as such. The corresponding private key is calculated and issued to the subject by a trusted third party. In an implicit certificate scheme, the subject has a private key which is not revealed to the CA during the certificate-issuing process. The CA is trusted to issue certificates correctly, but not to hold individual user's private keys. Wrongly issued certificates can be revoked, whereas there is no comparable mechanism for misuse of private keys in an identity-based scheme. Description of the ECQV scheme Initially the scheme parameters must be agreed upon. These are: * The elliptic curve parameters, including a generating point G \\\\,of order n \\\\,. * An encoding function \\\\textrm{Encode}(ID, \\\\gamma) which encodes its arguments as a byte-block, and a corresponding \\\\textrm{Decode}_{\\\\gamma}( \\\\sdot ) which extracts the \\\\gamma value from an encoding. * A hash function H_n( \\\\sdot ) which accepts a byte- block and yields a hash value as an integer in the range [0, n-1] The certificate authority CA will have private key c \\\\, and public key Q_{CA} = cG = Certificate request protocol = Here, Alice will be the user who requests the implicit certificate from the CA. She has identifying information ID_A. # Alice generates a random integer \\\\alpha \\\\, # Alice computes A = \\\\alpha\\\\,G \\\\, and sends A and ID_A to the CA. # CA selects a random integer k \\\\, from [1, n-1] \\\\, and computes kG \\\\,. # CA computes \\\\gamma = A + kG \\\\, (this is the public key reconstruction data) # CA computes Cert= \\\\textrm{Encode} ( \\\\gamma , \\\\textrm{ID}_A ) \\\\, # CA computes e = H_n( Cert ) # CA computes s = ek + c \\\\pmod{n} \\\\, ( s \\\\, is the private key reconstruction data) # CA sends (s, Cert) \\\\, to Alice # Alice computes e' = H_n (Cert) and her private key a = e'\\\\alpha + s \\\\pmod{n} \\\\, # Alice computes \\\\gamma' = \\\\textrm{Decode}_{\\\\gamma} (Cert) and her public key Q_A = e'\\\\gamma' + Q_{CA} \\\\, # Alice verifies that the certificate is valid, i.e. that Q_A = aG = Using the certificate = Here, Alice wants to prove her identity to Bob, who trusts the CA. # Alice sends Cert to Bob, and a ciphertext C created using her private key a. The ciphertext can be a digital signature, or part of an Authenticated Key Exchange protocol. # Bob computes \\\\gamma = \\\\textrm{Decode}_{\\\\gamma} (Cert) and e = H_n (Cert). # Bob computes Alice's alleged public key Q_A' = e\\\\gamma + Q_{CA} # Bob validates ciphertext C using Q_A'. If this validation is successful, he can trust that the key Q_A' is owned by the user whose identity information is contained in Cert. = Proof of equivalence of private and public keys = Alice's private key is a = e'\\\\alpha + s = e\\\\alpha + ek + c \\\\pmod{n} The public key reconstruction value \\\\gamma = A + kG = (\\\\alpha + k)G Alice's public key is Q_A = e\\\\gamma + Q_{CA} = e(\\\\alpha + k)G + cG = (e\\\\alpha + ek + c)G Therefore, Q_A = aG, which completes the proof.

Originally built as Elizabeth Holland by S. P. Austin & Son, Ltd., Sunderland, England in 1897‚Äì98, she was acquired by the Navy from Samuel P. Holland, London, 16 April 1898, and commissioned at New York on 21 May 1898 with Commander William Irwin Moore in command. Service history =Collier, 1898-1912= Converted into a collier for duty with the newly established Navy Fleet Train, Leonidas departed New York on 30 May 1898 on a coaling voyage to Key West, Florida, and following her return to Norfolk in mid-June, sailed again on the 23rd for Cuba and Jamaica, supplying occupation troops and naval units. Putting into League Island Navy Yard, Philadelphia on 15 December, she decommissioned on the 27th and remained there in reserve for nearly two years. Reactivated on 8 November 1900 she served with the Collier Service, carrying coal to naval ships and stations along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies through 1908. Decommissioning at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, from 15 February to 11 June 1909, the ship resumed her service as an Atlantic Fleet Auxiliary. In 1912, the Leonidas carried several tons of relics retrieved from the , including the battleship's main mast, to the United States. She was placed out of service on 3 May 1912 at Portsmouth to fit out for duty as a survey ship. =Survey ship, 1914-1917= Recommissioned on 1 April 1914, Leonidas sailed from Portsmouth via Boston to survey the coast of Panama. From that date until 24 April 1917 the converted survey ship made four surveying trips to the Caribbean, charting the coasts of Panama, Honduras, and Nicaragua and making general observations on climate and terrain. With the outbreak of World War I, she took up patrol duty in the Caribbean, searching for possible enemy submarine bases in Central America. As part of the Caribbean Detachment, Patrol Force, Atlantic Fleet, Leonidas remained in the West Indies until sailing for home 4 September, arriving Portsmouth 30 October. =Tender, 1918-1922= There the survey ship was converted, once again, this time into a tender capable of supplying two squadrons of submarine chasers. Leonidas sailed for the Mediterranean on 8 March 1918 via New York, Bermuda, the Azores and Gibraltar, arriving Corfu, Italy on 8 June and remaining there tending her submarine chasers guarding the area from submarine attack. After the Armistice on 20 November, the tender sailed for home via ports in Italy, the Riviera, and Spain, and escorted a convoy of submarine chasers from the Azores to Bermuda. She twice more escorted homeward bound small craft before arriving New York on 8 September. Following short voyages to New London and Newport in support of her submarine chasers, the ship sailed for Key West on 11 October and operated off the southern U.S. coast as tender for the destroyers of Reserve Destroyer Squadron 1, Atlantic Fleet, out of Charleston, South Carolina until sailing for New York and arriving 19 May 1921. Leonidas sailed to Newport for duty 1 June to 17 October and, after returning to New York, sailed for Norfolk on the 28th, arriving two days later. She decommissioned there on 28 November, and was sold on 5 June 1922 to Ammunitions Products Corporation of Washington, D.C. as the SS Elizabeth Holland.

Daniello eventually became an informant and helped destroy the Camorra crime gangs in Brooklyn. Early life Daniello's real name was Alfonso Pepe. In Italy he was arrested for attacking a woman and on suspicion of involvement in a murder.Raffaele Daniello, GangRule.com After his escape from prison in 1906 he made his way to the French port of Le Havre, from which he sailed to New York where he was smuggled in illegally.Di Marco Murder Is Again Described The Daily Standard Union, March 7, 1918 In New York, Daniello became a low-level criminal who participated in labor racketeering and extortion. He was involved in the 1913 Labor slugger war. Mafia-Camorra War In 1916 he became involved in the Mafia-Camorra War. He was a member of the Navy Street Gang, made up primarily of Italians from Naples, Italy. In November 1916, Daniello participated in the ambush murders of Nicholas Morello and Charles Ubriaco on a New York Street.Camorra: The Navy Street Gang, GangRule.com These killings were part of an ongoing gang war between the Morello crime family, part of the traditional Sicilian mafia, and the Brooklyn Camorra, a Neapolitan crime organization. During this era, a crime organization would usually consist of individuals from the same clan, village, or region in Italy. In later years, the gangs would be based more on individual families and would allow any Italian to become a full member. In hiding After being acquitted on robbery and abduction charges, Daniello decided it wasn't safe to stay in New York. In May 1917, Daniello and his girlfriend fled to Reno, Nevada. In July 1917, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) police issued a warrant for Daniello's arrest for the May 7 murder of Louis DeMarro in Brooklyn. Meanwhile, Daniello and his girlfriend were running low on money in Reno. He wrote the Camorra Gang asking for help, but they ignored his requests. Daniello was eventually arrested in Nevada and extradited back to New York.Confession May Clear 23 Feud Murders, The New York Times, November 28, 1917 Informant Facing indictments on murder, grand larceny and perjury, Daniello began to tell the police about the Navy Street crew and its connection to the Morello and Ubriaco murders. He provided evidence about 23 murders. Several Grand Juries issued 21 indictments in November 1917.Nelli, The Business of Crime, pp. 133-134Indict Twelve In Murder Conspiracy, The New York Times, December 1, 1917 New York prosecutors offered Daniello a deal if he would testify against Alessandro Vollero, the Camorra leader. Daniello, who had attended several high level meetings with Vollero, agreed to the deal. In 1917, Vollero was extradited to New York and indicted in the murders of Morello, Umbracio and Manhattan gambler George Verrizano (which Daniello later claimed he had participated in). Daniello's testimony, along with that of \\"Johnny the Left\\" Esposito, Tony Notaro, and other Navy Street and Coney Island gang members, led to Vollaro's conviction. The conviction of Vollero and his associates marked the end of both the Navy Street Gang and the Brooklyn Camorra organization. Death Because of the abuse he received after testifying at the trial against Vollero, Daniello was moved to a different prison. He received a suspended sentence in consideration of his testimony. However, shortly later he was arrested for assaulting a man in Coney Island. Daniello claimed he shot the victim thinking that he had been sent on a vendetta from his former associates of the Navy Street gang. He was sentenced to five years in prison. Released in 1925 he was shot in his saloon, near Metuchen, New Jersey. References *Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. *Nelli, Humbert.

The film was produced and filmed in India however, and was highly influenced by South Indian melodrama. It was first shown on January 21, 1947 at the Kingsley Cinema in Colombo, Sri Lanka. A remake was released in 1982.  Plot  Ralahamy, a member of high status, dies leaving his family in debt after having squandered his fortune through extensive drinking and other vices. To get back into wealth, Ralahamy's wife Tackla pushes her daughter Ranjani to marry a wealthy older man Victor with a child through an earlier marriage. In this process, Samson, Ranjani's boyfriend, who had tried extensively to get the family back into good graces going so far as to pay off their debts, is spurned. He then goes abroad to win a fortune. When Samson returns he learns of Ranjani's engagement to Victor and tries to reach her through letter. His letters are hidden from her however, and rumours spread that Samson is now a cripple. Ultimately the truth is revealed. = Cast = *Rukmani Devi as Ranjani: A high-class girl who is pushed into a marriage with an older man and forced to reject her boyfriend. *Gemini Kantha as Jossie: village woman; love interest of Manappuwa *Rupa Devi as Tackla: Ranjani's mother *Miriam Jayamanne as Hilda *Eddie Jayamanne as Manappuwa: naive village simpleton; comic relief *B.

He has mastered a wide range of dance forms including hip hop, classical, modern, classical ballet, and contemporary ballet. He remained the principal dancer at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater from 1987 to 1994.  Life and career  Born in 1969 and raised in Queens, NY, Richardson discovered dance at a block party at the age of 10. He grew up in a household filled with music which fostered his connection to dance; his grandmother was a singer and church choir director while his absentee father was a rhythm and blues musician with the group The Manhattans. His mother recognized his musical connection and had him sing in a church choir. After practicing popping and locking for the next three years, Richardson soon came across ballet on television. His mother, however, could not afford formal ballet training and gave him a subscription to Dance Magazine to expose him to ballet technique. Using his street training, Richardson auditioned for the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts where he received a full scholarship to study classical ballet technique and modern dance.\\"Desmond Richardson.\\" Contemporary Black Biography, vol. 39, Gale, 2003. Gale In Context: Biography, https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/K1606002485/BIC?u=columbiau&sid;=BIC&xid;=f703db6b. The next year, he auditioned for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center (1983-1986) and received a scholarship to study under Alvin Ailey. He also received a merit scholarship for the Internationale Akademie des Tanzes in K√∂ln, Germany (1984-1985) and was the recipient of a Presidential Scholar Award for the Arts (1986) from YoungArts. In 1986, Alvin Ailey personally invited him to become a member of his junior company, the Ailey Repertory Company. Richardson then danced with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater as a principal dancer from 1987 to 1994 before starting his own company with fellow Ailey dancer, Dwight Rhoden. In his seven years with the company, Richardson danced works by Jos√© Lim√≥n, John Butler, Elisa Monte, and many others. In 1994, Complexions Contemporary Ballet was formed by Desmond Richardson and Dwight Rhoden. The company sought to diverge from the hetero- normative black masculinity of the \\"Soul\\" aesthetic that was cultivated in companies such as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.Osterweis, Ariel. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43966083 \\"The Muse of Virtuosity: Desmond Richardson, Race, and Choreographic Falsetto\\". Dance Research Journal, vol. 45, no. 3, 2013, pp. 53‚Äì74. JSTOR. The company, rather, produced its own \\"Post-Soul\\" aesthetic rooted in black exploration and individual eccentricity. Through Richardson's and Rhoden's direction, Complexions introduced heterogeneity into American concert dance with their emphasis on gender ambivalence and the plurality of race, sexuality, and dance formality. At the same time as starting his own company, Richardson joined the Frankfurt Ballet in 1994, which was under the direction of William Forsythe. As Forsythe pushed the boundaries of classical ballet and its integration with the visual arts, Richardson sharpened his improvisational technique and understanding of dance to be a work of art rather than a display of star dancers. In 1997, he joined the American Ballet Theatre where he performed the lead role in the company's world premiere production of Othello and quickly was promoted to become the first African American principal dancer since the inception of the company. Aiding in the transformation of ballet from a predominately white form, Richardson performed many other lead roles to critical acclaim. In 1998, Richardson joined the premiere cast of the Broadway musical Fosse for which he received a 1999 Tony Award Nomination. He has also appeared on Broadway in the musicals The Look of Love: The songs of Burt Bacharach, City Center Encores, Movin' Out, and most recently, the Tony-winning hit show After Midnight. Richardson has performed as a guest artist with several world-renowned companies including the Swedish Opera Ballet, the Washington Ballet, Teatro at La Scala, and the San Francisco Ballet. He has appeared on TV shows as a celebrity performer and choreographer for SYTYCD, Amici(Italy), Israel(SYTYCD), and Australia(SYTYCD). He performed at Larry Rosen's Jazz Roots where he and Grammy Artist Bobby Mcferrin performed an impromptu improv to an astounded audience in Miami at the Adrienne Arsht Performing Arts Venue. Richardson is a multifaceted artist as he still performs worldwide and is considered a Master Teacher. He is a faculty member at the dance conventions ASH, NYCDA, and PULSE. Creating his own Complexions Academy, he continues to push forward in new endeavors and giving back to students striving for excellence. With his work in Complexions Contemporary Ballet, Richardson defined his brand by his practice of improvisation in formal concert works. Often attributed with his avant-garde style, his improvisational work combines classical ballet and modern movements with that of black vernacular forms, such as popping, locking, and voguing. His exceptional execution of technique and stylistic versatility contributes to Complexions' diversification of the American dance sphere. Furthermore, his work with Ailey and spiritual black dance gave way to Rhoden and Richardson analyzing the conflict between religion and sexuality within their works. Rather than presenting an answer to this conflict, both artists transform the trauma attached to the plights of sexuality and race to create a genre of affirmation through their work.  Other projects  Richardson has worked in television, film, and video in the United States and abroad. These experiences have allowed him to perform with such musical artists as Michael Jackson, Prince, Aretha Franklin, and Madonna. He performed with Michael Jackson in his 30th-anniversary celebration at Madison Square Garden. Additional performances include being a featured guest artist in the 71st Academy Awards live television presentation and a principal role in Debbie Allen's a dance/theatrical presentation, Soul Possessed, which had its world premiere at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1999. Richardson is featured in Patrick Swayze's film, One Last Dance and the film version of the Oscar-winning Chicago. On July 16, 2008, Richardson was featured as a choreographer on So You Think You Can Dance.  Awards  * Fiorello H.

Haplophrentis is a genus of tiny shelled hyolithid which lived in the Cambrian Period. Its shell was long and conical, with the open end protected by an operculum, from which two fleshy arms called helens protruded at the sides. These arms served to elevate the opening of the shells above the sea floor, acting like stilts.  Morphology  Mature Haplophrentis ranged in length between 2‚Äì6 cm, H, reesi being larger than H. carinatus. Juveniles could of course be smaller. It is distinguished from Hyolithes by the presence of a longitudinal septum on the middle of the inner surface of the top of the shell. Its soft anatomy comprises 12(H. carinatus) to 16 (H. reesi) tentacles attached to a horseshoe- shaped lophophore. A pair of wide structures of uncertain function extend along the length of the conical shell. A larval shell is attached to the shell apex.  Affinity  The soft anatomy of Haplophrentis was key to establishing the hyoliths as members of the Lophophorata, the group containing brachiopods and phoronids.  Ecology  Haplophrentis was a filter feeder, using its lophophore to extract organic matter from passing seawater. Specimens of Haplophrentis have been found in the gut of the predator Ottoia.  Occurrence  It is also known from several specimens in the Spence Shale, and occurs prolifically at the Marble Canyon locality. Many specimens at Stanley Glacier display soft tissue well.

His triple citizenship, primarily that with Italy, sparked a debate over which senior international team he might attempt to play for, as fears arose that Ferrari might play for Italy instead of his native United States, like Giuseppe Rossi. Gabriel quickly dismissed the speculation, saying: > \\"I'm a New Yorker. I grew up in the US and that is the country I would like > to play for if I get the chance.\\" Ferrari scored the game-winning goal in his international debut with the US under-20 team in a 2‚Äì1 victory over the full Haitian national team on March 28 in Frisco, Texas.

Biography Orphaned at the age of ten, he began working at age 15 at Weinstock, Lubin and Co., selling ties in the menswear department. He rose to General Manager of Weinstock Lubin. He later started Johnston's Men's Wear at 916 Market Street in San Francisco. He was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1907 and was appointed Chair of the California State Board of Control in 1911. He served as wardens of Folsom and San Quentin. From left to right: Warden James A. Johnston, Associate Warden E.J. Miller, District Attorney Frank J. Hennessy It was Johnston who was instrumental in the development of the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary as a prison and was involved in the design of it as a federal prison in 1934. He served as the first warden of Alcatraz from 1934 until 1948. He was considered to be a highly strict disciplinarian and a devout reformist who imposed a number of rules upon the prison including a strict code of silence, which led to him being nicknamed the 'Golden Rule Warden' from his San Quentin days. He was relatively popular among inmates and guards, known as \\"Old Saltwater\\" to the inmates, and is credited with challenging the barbaric tactics used in the prison when he was there, including strait jackets and solitary confinement in darkness and working towards the general improvement of the lives of prisoners. In 1937 he was assaulted by Burton Phillips from behind in the Dining hall who beat him in anger at a worker's strike, but he continued to attend meals unguarded. Ten of the fourteen escape attempts took place during his tenure, including the one that resulted in the Battle of Alcatraz. Johnston wrote several books about their experiences, including \\"Prison Life is Different\\" where he documents his time spent as warden at Folsom, San Quentin, and Alcatraz. He was married to Ida Mae Fulton and had one son and three daughters. He died of a bronchial infection on September 7, 1954 in San Francisco, California.

Organisation  the rector was Shakhov Boris Yevgenevich (Russian –®–∞—Ö–æ–≤ –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω—å–µ–≤–∏—á), D.Sc., Honored Worker of Science RF. This medical school is currently ranked number 7 out of 46 higher medical institutions in Russia, acknowledged by World Health Organization and is recognised by the governments of some other countries which send their students to this academy for medical education and training. This academy also is associated with many teaching hospitals distributed throughout the city, where the students learn many basic clinical skills. There are 70 specialised departments with over 600 teaching staff. It has approximately 3000 students in 7 faculties which include: * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Pediatrics * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Medico-prophylaxis (Preventive medicine) * Faculty of Stomatology (Dentistry) * Faculty of Higher Nursing Education * Faculty of Preparatory courses (Pre-medical courses) The administrative office of the academy is situated in the Minin and Pozharsky Square (located alongside the Volga River and the medical students live in dormitories on Meditsinskaya Street in Prioksky City District.  Faculty of Foreign Admissions  Besides Russian students, there are also students from foreign countries such as Morocco, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, Kenya, Tanzania, Jordan, Pakistan, Namibia and many others who study in this academy. Some of the foreign students study medicine completely in English medium, and some others study in Russian language. The current Dean of the Foreign Students Department is Professor Stelnikova D.Sc., who is also the Head of the Department for anatomy. However, students who study in English medium also have to study Russian language to be able to communicate with local Russian people who have very little knowledge of English, and thus being able to communicate with patients for basic clinical training.  Faculty of Medicine  Most students have to undergo one year of preliminary course for one year, before continuing their undergraduate studies. General Medicine program lasts after 6 years. The first academic year of the General Medicine course begins with the teaching of fundamental medical sciences such as medical biology, Biophysics, general chemistry and Organic Chemistry, History of Medicine, Human Anatomy, and so on. Because of the aforementioned, the course runs in a longer duration (a 6-year programme) as compared to General Medicine courses (5-year programmes) offered by other universities in other countries. Clinical education starts officially on the third academic year with the so-called \\"cycles\\". Every few weeks, students are rotated and exposed to different parts of clinical medicine such as Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Infectious Diseases, Pediatrics, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Neurology, Orthopedics, Radiology, Public Health and so on. Classes are then conducted in different specialised hospitals within the Nizhny Novgorod region. Upon graduation, the graduates are awarded a first professional degree which is the doctor of medicine or M.D. which is an M.B.B.S. equivalent because the graduates have been trained in the field of general surgery. Students who have achieved very well academically are awarded with a red degree or a first class honor equivalent.  Accommodation and Cultural Life  Each hostel is equipped with a canteen and cafe with provisions of kitchen and dining hall on each floor. The academy provides a springboard for sportsmen with sporting facilities such as sports complex, including gymnasium, indoor football, badminton, tennis, volleyball, athletic stadiums, etc. Different social and cultural events are organized for foreign students. National and International associations of students are being organized to unite students from different countries.  Postgraduate Programmes  Postgraduate courses are also provided for both Russian and international students. Among the courses are Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Radiology, General Surgery, Traumatology and Orthopedics, Cardiovascular Surgery, Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Pediatric Surgery, Obstetric and Gynaecology, Epidemiology, Hygiene, Microbiology, Orthodontics etc. See also *Education in Russia References Category:Universities in Volga Region ","title":"Privolzhsky Research Medical University"},{"id":"9900242","text":"was a Japanese actress best known for her appearances in \\"pink film\\" during the 1960s and early 1970s. Katori was the star of Flesh Market (1962), the first of these softcore pornographic films made in Japan. With over 600 film credits between 1962 and 1972, she was one of the most prolific Japanese adult film actresses of the 1960s, and became known as the \\"Pink Princess\\" of the first wave of pink films.  Life and career  = Early life = Tamaki Katori was born in 1938. After being chosen as Kumamoto's entry in the Miss Universe Kumamoto beauty pageant, Katori was hired by Japan's oldest major film studio, Nikkatsu. = Flesh Market = Katori was still acting in supporting roles at Nikkatsu when she appeared in director Satoru Kobayashi's controversial 1962 film, Flesh Market. The first Japanese film to contain nudity (director Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh, made for Nikkatsu in 1964, would become the first mainstream Japanese film to contain nude scenes),Weisser, p.21. Flesh Market was shut down by the police and censored before it could be re-released. Officially considered the first pink film‚Äîthe softcore pornographic genre which would dominate Japan's domestic cinema in the 1960s and 1970s\\\\-- Flesh Market became a huge box-office success. Even with the limited distribution it received as an independent production, Flesh Market, which was made for 8 million yen, took in over 100 million yen. = Nikkatsu = At Nikkatsu, Katori continued playing supporting roles, notably in several early films directed by future pink film master, K≈çji Wakamatsu. In his pre-pink days at Nikkatsu, from 1963 to 1965, Wakamatsu made 20 low-budget exploitation movies based on current events such as sensational crimes and disasters.Weisser, p.287. Though at first the work was steady, Katori was barely surviving on the bit-part wages from Nikkatsu. When the major film studios started facing a decline in audiences, they began cutting back in film output. Katori's income suffered as well. = Pink films = In the years after Flesh Market's release, several independent studios began specializing in the new pink film genre that had sprung up in the wake of that film's success. When one of these studios was willing to give Katori a contract to star in their pink films, she accepted the offer. She later explained, \\"They offered me 20,000 yen a movie. It was an incredible sum in those days. I hadn't been able to make it in mainstream movies because people said with my baby face and big boobs I was unbalanced, but those attributes turned out to be exactly what the pink movie business was looking for.\\" At Aoi Eiga studio, established in 1966 to specialize in these low-budget and profitable Pink films, Katori often worked in the sensationalistic and exploitative films of director Giichi Nishihara. Nishihara's films of the 1960s and 1970s would lead critics to call him both \\"Japan's sleaziest movie-maker,\\"Weisser, p.351. and \\"a cult favorite among devotees of extreme cinema.\\" In Staircase of Sex (1968) Nishihara starred Katori with two foreign models in an attempt to cash in on the exotic appeal of the Caucasian performers.Sharp, 182. Allmovie critic Robert Firsching comments on her work for the director at this studio, \\"Katori... deserves some sort of medal for valor after allowing Nishihara and Aoi Eiga studios to have her brutally raped five times in four films.\\" Early in his career, \\"Pillar of Pink\\" director Mamoru Watanabe collaborated with Atsushi Yamatoya-- Seijun Suzuki's screenwriter on Branded to Kill‚Äîin several films. Katori starred in the team's 1969 film Women Hell Song: Man-Killing Benten, an atypical pink film inspired by Toei's Red Peony Gambler series. Jasper Sharp singles out a scene in which Katori makes love in an abandoned temple, as one of the most striking set pieces in the pink film genre. Katori worked with K≈çji Wakamatsu again in the late 1960s and early 1970s, after he had left Nikkatsu to form his own production company. In the Masao Adachi- scripted Sex Jack (1970), Katori appears as the lone female member of a group of anti-government radical students who plan to assassinate the prime minister and hijack a plane to North Korea. Shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1971, French censors claimed the film was \\"anti-social\\".Sharp, p. 107. One of Katori's final films with Wakamatsu was Sex Family (1971), which starred future Nikkatsu Roman Porno queen, Junko Miyashita.Weisser, p.289. A leading actress of the first-wave of the Pink film from 1964 to 1972, a period which was dominated by independent studios, Katori retired from acting just as her old employer, Nikkatsu, was taking over the genre and establishing the second period of Pink film, the Roman Porno era. = Retirement = After retirement from film, Katori was married to actor Jun Funado for seven years. After they divorced, she married Toshio Okuwaki, director of such pink films as Bed Dance (1967), which featured an early appearance by Naomi Tani. Okuwaki had been Katori's director in several of her own pink film appearances. A third husband moved with her back to her hometown of Kumamoto, where he went to work for the pharmaceutical company Katori's father had owned. Though she gained a child from this marriage, she was eventually divorced again.\\" After her third divorce, Katori decided to support herself. She first ran a gasoline station, and, as of 2006, was running a company canteen. Reflecting on her role as a pioneering pink film star, Katori said, \\"I enjoyed my acting, but I never really got used to the atmosphere of the pink movie business.\\" However, she added, \\"I've got no regrets about my time in the entertainment world. I'd still go back there now to perform if there was a part for this old girl.\\" Three films that Katori had made in 1969 with her second husband, Toshio Okuwaki were shown at the 2003 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival. In September 2009, the 1960s careers of Katori and director Giichi Nishihara‚Äîworking together and separately‚Äîwere the subject of a retrospective at the Kobe Planet Film Archive.

If lymphocytes are cultured in the presence of Interleukin 2, it results in the development of effector cells which are cytotoxic to tumor cells. Mechanism It has been shown that lymphocytes, when exposed to Interleukin 2, are capable of lysing fresh, non-cultured cancer cells, both primary and metastatic. LAK cells respond to these lymphokines, particularly IL-2, by lysing tumor cells that were already known to be resistant to NK cell activity. The mechanism of LAK cells is distinctive from that of natural killer cells because they can lyse cells that NK cells cannot. LAK cells are also capable of acting against cells that do not display the major histocompatibility complex, as has been shown by the ability to cause lysis in non-immunogenic, allogeneic and syngeneic tumors. LAK cells are specific to tumor cells and do not display activity against normal cells. Cancer Treatment LAK cells, along with the administration of IL-2 have been experimentally used to treat cancer in mice and humans, but there is very high toxicity with this treatment - Severe fluid retention was the major side effect of therapy, although all side effects resolved after interleukin-2 administration was stopped.

Its fossils are found well-preserved in the Burgess Shale in Canada. It grew up to 10 cm long. Etymology Olenoides ‚Äì from Olenus, in Greek mythology a man who, along with his wife Lethaea, was turned to stone. Olenus was used for a trilobite genus name in 1827; the suffix -oides(‚Äúresembling‚Äù) was added later. Discussion Olenoides followed the basic structure of all trilobites ‚Äî a cephalon (head shield), a thorax with seven jointed parts, and finally a semicircular pygidium. Its antennae were long, and curved back along its sides. Its thin legs show that it was no swimmer, instead crawling along the sea floor in search of prey.

Its cephalon is semi-circular. The glabella is parallel-sided, rounded at its front and almost reaches the anterior border. Narrow occular ridges curve backwards from the front of the glabella to the small, outwardly- bowed eyes. The librigenae narrow backward into straight, slender genal spines that reach as far as the third thorax segment. Thorax consists of seven segments that end in needle-like spines. pygidium) has six axial rings that decrease in size backwards and four or five pairs of rearward pointing marginal spines. Cephalon, thorax and pygidium are of approximately equal length. Olenoides serratus is one of about twenty species of which the non- calcified parts are known, due to so-called soft tissue preservation. The antennae are the most anterior pair of appendages in trilobites. In O. serratus, these are attached about halfway the immediately adjacent to the hypostome, and appear from the dorsal side under the cephalon in front of the side of the glabella. They were flexible, having a tubular shape that became narrower towards anterior and composed of between 40 and 50 segments that are each shorter than wide. Olenellus serratus is the only known trilobite with cerci, uniramous appendages on ventral side of last pygidial segment, and these are shaped like the antennas.

Other cast include Damian Lau, Anthony Wong, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Lau Ching-Wan, Paul Chun and Kwan Shan. Plot Executioners reunites the main characters of The Heroic Trio in a dark, post-apocalyptic story set in a world ravaged by war, torn by social and political strife, and desperately short of uncontaminated water. The Wonder Woman (Anita Mui) is now the mother of a young girl, named (in the English dubbed version) Charlie. She has abandoned her role as a crime fighter in order to become a better mother and wife. But while walking her daughter home from the grocery store, she witnesses an attempted water theft. In a brief display of her true prowess (and to the delight of her daughter), she stops the thief and returns the bagged water to the would-be victim. The Invisible Girl, (Michelle Yeoh), has finally accepted her true role as a hero and strives to atone for the evil deeds she committed while under the influence of her former Evil Master (as shown in The Heroic Trio), She has become an agent of change, striving to use her abilities for the good of society. She's gone so far as to become the tutor of the masked hunchback Kau, another of the Evil Master's former servants. Lured into a blast furnace in \\"The Heroic Trio\\", Kau had been horribly burned and disfigured; somehow, he retains his almost superhuman vitality and ability, yet has no moral compass, other than his allegiance to his tutor. She hopes to reform him and show him a better way, as the Wonder Woman and the Thief Catcher did for her. The Thief Catcher (Maggie Cheung), is still up to her old ways, just trying to make a profit out of a bad situation. Yet even she is starting to strive for a higher standard, and has come to realize that she is part of a team and has responsibilities to something greater than herself. The three heroes are forced to overcome devastating personal loss, conflicting loyalties, and overwhelming odds, to bring security and justice back to the people.

Forming out of a tropical wave on July 30, 1997, roughly 345 mi (555 km) south of Salina Cruz, Mexico, Guillermo tracked in a steady west- northwestward direction while intensifying. The system reached hurricane status by August 1 before undergoing rapid intensification the following day. At the end of this phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a powerful Category 5 hurricane. The storm began to weaken during the afternoon of August 5 and was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8\\\\. Once entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, Guillermo briefly weakened to a tropical depression before re-attaining tropical storm status. On August 15, the storm reached an unusually high latitude of 41.8¬∞N before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants persisted for more than a week as they tracked towards the northeast and later south and east before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system off the coast of California on August 24\\\\. Throughout Guillermo's track, the storm never threatened any major landmass, resulting in little impact on land. However, because of its extreme intensity, it produced large swells across the Pacific Ocean, affecting areas from Hawaii to coastal Mexico. Along the American Pacific coast, three people drowned amid high waves, two in Baja California and one in California. At its peak, Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record; however, it has since been surpassed by seven other storms, including Linda later that year. The effects of Guillermo were not deemed severe enough to justify retirement of its name.  Meteorological history  Track of Hurricane Guillermo across the eastern and central Pacific basins Hurricane Guillermo began its extensive track as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 16, 1997. Initially disorganized and weak, the system tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean for several weeks. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that they had issues monitoring the system as it moved through the Caribbean; however, they interpreted through satellite data that the wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean between July 27 and 28. Once in the Pacific, convection, areas of thunderstorm activity, and banding features began to form. Additionally, a low pressure system developed within the disturbance by July 29\\\\. The following day, the system became sufficiently organized for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine-E; at this time the depression was situated roughly 345 mi (555 km) south of Salina Cruz, Mexico. In response to a deep-layer ridge to the north, the depression tracked at a steady pace towards the west- northwest, and this motion persisted through the first week of August. Within a day of being classified, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Guillermo, the seventh named storm of the 1997 season. By the afternoon of August 1, a strong central dense overcast, an area of high, thick clouds, developed over the center of circulation, prompting the NHC to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. Throughout the next day, the system gradually developed an eye within the central dense overcast, leading to further strengthening. Operationally, Guillermo was thought to have briefly leveled out in intensity on August 2; however, in post-storm analysis, the NHC discovered that a steady period of rapid intensification took place. Unlike most hurricanes in the eastern Pacific, Guillermo was investigated by Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft during its rapid intensification stage. The aircraft released several dropsondes into the storm to gather meteorological data. This mission marked the first time the Hurricane Hunters recorded high-resolution wind data from flight level to within several meters of the ocean surface inside the eyewall of a major hurricane. Hurricane Guillermo undergoing rapid intensification on August 4 Radar was also employed to determine the size of the hurricane's eye, stated to be roughly 13 mi (20 km) in diameter, following a 6-mile (10 km) decrease due to the strengthening. Light wind shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place. Late on August 2, the system attained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h), making it a Category 4 storm. During the afternoon of August 3, Guillermo nearly attained Category 5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) along with a barometric pressure estimated at 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg). A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued. Late on August 4, Guillermo intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 160 mph (260 km/h). Operational analysis of satellite information indicated a minimum pressure of 921 mbar (hPa; 27.2 inHg); however, post-storm studies stated that the pressure was more likely around 919 mbar (hPa; 27.14 inHg). At its peak, cloud temperatures within the eyewall were estimated to be as low as . Using the Dvorak technique, a method used to estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones, a value of 7.6 was obtained. This indicated that maximum winds at the surface could have been as high as 181 mph (291 km/h); however, this was not used as the reported intensity as six- to twelve-hour averages indicated sustained winds around 160 mph (260 km/h). After maintaining this intensity for roughly 18 hours, the system began to weaken as it moved into a less favorable environment with moderate wind shear. Cloud temperatures within the eyewall also began to increase, indicating that the hurricane was losing intensity. Radar image of Hurricane Guillermo on August 3 Steady weakening took place over the following several days, and the storm dropped below major hurricane status on August 6\\\\. By August 8, Guillermo moved over colder waters and was downgraded to a tropical storm as sustained winds dropped below 75 mph (120 km/h). Around this time, the storm started to move along the western edge of the ridge that previously steered it towards the west-northwest, causing Guillermo to turn northwest. On August 9, the storm crossed longitude 140¬∞W, denoting a shift in warning responsibility from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). Not long after crossing into the CPHC's area of responsibility, the storm further weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over waters. Although most tropical cyclones generally weaken as they increase in latitude, warm waters of allowed Guillermo to re-intensify into a tropical storm on August 11\\\\. Gradually, the storm attained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) before succumbing to cooler waters further north. The storm weakened to a tropical depression once more on August 15, situated well to the north of the Hawaiian islands. Later that day, Guillermo transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at an unusually high latitude of 41.8¬∞N, roughly 850 mi (1,370 km) south-southeast of Unalaska, Alaska. Over the following days, the remnants of the hurricane turned northeastward towards the Pacific coast of North America. On August 19, the system moved within 575 mi (925 km) of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, before Guillermo tracked southward. Over the following few days, the system slowed significantly and turned towards the east. By August 20, moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Ignacio were entrained into the eastern portion of Guillermo's circulation. On August 24, Guillermo's remnant low was finally absorbed by a larger extratropical system, while situated roughly 345 mi (555 km) off of the northern California coastline.  Impact and records  Along the Pacific coast of Mexico, surf produced by Hurricane Guillermo affected numerous beaches. From Cabo San Lucas to San Jos√© del Cabo, the storm sent waves from the Gulf of California over the grounds of beachside resorts. Tourists were driven off some of Cabo's most popular beaches by the rough ocean conditions which flooded homes situated along the coast. Two sightseers were killed after being swept out to sea. Due to accurate forecasts, emergency officials across California were able to close off swimming zones and warn the public about dangerous rip currents prior to their arrival. Guillermo generated heavy surf across the beaches of Southern California. Heights from the surf averaged with local areas reaching above , favorable to around 500 surfers at an annual competition at Huntington Beach. According to the Los Angeles Times, some waves reached heights of . Over 100 rescues were reported by local lifeguards. Waves ranging from also affected Orange County. Hundreds of people were rescued, but rip currents were blamed for three injuries and one death. On August 5, about a mile north of Huntington Beach pier, a 19-year-old man was swept away. His body was recovered several days later. On August 6, a teenage boy and girl were injured on a beach in Corona Del Mar, while an 18-year-old was pulled ashore and sent to the hospital with neck injuries. In Newport Beach, lifeguards made nearly 300 rescues on August 5 and 6 alone. In addition to coastal impacts, the system brought a surge of warm, moist air into Southern California, bringing temperatures in some areas as high as . Between August 15 and 17, large waves generated while Guillermo was at peak intensity came ashore in Hawaii. The swells caused no damage and reached heights of in eastern-facing shores of the state. At the time, Hurricane Guillermo's central pressure of 919 mbar (hPa; 27.14 inHg) established it as the second-most intense Pacific hurricane on record, behind Hurricane Ava of 1973. However, later in the 1997 season, Hurricane Linda set a new intensity record, and in subsequent years, hurricanes Kenna, Ioke, Rick, Marie, Odile, and Patricia all achieved lower minimum pressures, leaving Guillermo in ninth place. Guillermo persisted for 16.5 days from its classification as a tropical depression to its transition into an extratropical storm, making it the sixth longest-lasting storm in the basin.

Built in 1898 by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, rail service to the station ended in 1979 and it has since been adapted for use by the Montgomery Area Visitor Center and commercial tenants. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and became a National Historic Landmark in 1976. History Postcard of Union Station, Alabama Archives- circa 1915An Amtrak train under the Union Station Train Shed, 1974. Erected of brick and limestone on a high bluff along the Alabama River, the station was built by Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;) in 1898. The station also served passenger trains of Atlantic Coast Line, Western Railway of Alabama, Seaboard Air Line, Central of Georgia, and Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. The station had six tracks under a 600-foot shed, with a coach yard on the south end of the station as well as a Railway Express Agency facility. The station's design segregated passengers by race and incorporated Romanesque Revival elements. L&N; trains using the station included the Azalean, Florida Arrow, Humming Bird, Pan-American and South Wind. Traditionally, the Southern Railway's Crescent and Piedmont Limited were routed through the station. The number of passenger trains using Union Station declined during the 1950s and 1960s. When Amtrak came into existence in 1971, it continued passenger service through Montgomery with a single train (the South Wind, later renamed the Floridian), operating between Chicago and Miami. However, this train was terminated in 1979 and Union Station was closed. After a period of disuse, Union Station was renovated for commercial tenants. The train shed still stands, although tracks under it have been replaced by asphalt parking. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, for its importance in the state's railroad transportation history, and for the train shed, a rare surviving example of a 19th-century gable-roofed shed (most of which were later replaced by balloon sheds). and Amtrak returned to Montgomery in 1989 with an extension of the Crescent called the Gulf Breeze from Birmingham to Mobile, but Union Station was not used. Instead, Amtrak contracted with a travel agent who occupied a former grain silo nearby. This Amtrak service was terminated in 1995, and Montgomery has had no passenger rail service since. Among other tenants, Union Station currently hosts the Montgomery Area Visitor Center.

These antiquities point the existence of several distinct cultures living in the Cromar over the millennia. Shouldering Morven is Culblean, the site of the Battle of Culblean in 1335. Running off the same hill is the Burn o‚Äô Vat, here the burn has carved a cauldron like gorge in the granite. This was the hideout of the notorious 18th-century outlaw Gilderoy McGregor. As with most of Royal Deeside, there are a number of minor mansions in the area, including Blelack, Tillypronie, Douneside and Alastrean House. The land is mainly put to farming cattle and sheep. There are a number of commercial forest plantations but also areas of natural birch woodland. The higher ground around the Cromar is heather moorland, much of it maintained for grouse shooting. Pheasants are a common sight lower down. The area also has a population of Red Squirrels.

Taxonomy  The taxonomic position in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Pt L, 1957 placed the genus into the family Deshayesitidae. Newer classifications have revised that placement and the genus is now included into the family Parahoplitidae. Parahoplites and Hypacanthoplites are similar genera.  Description  These ammonites have a strongly ribbed shell and ammonitic suture. Early whorls are coronate, which later become round, then oval in section. Primary ribs may have swellings (bullae) at the umbilicus or are without. In early stages primary ribs branch mid flank at prominent lateral tubercles. In later stages lateral tubercles are reduced or absent and primary ribs branch simply at the umbilical shoulder or, again, mid flank. Sutural elements are subquadrate with narrow, shallow embayments. The first lateral lobe tends to be symmetrical.

It is located atop a small island near the town of Kanyakumari on the southernmost point of the Indian peninsula on the Coromandel Coast, where two seas (the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea) and an ocean (the Indian Ocean) meet. The statue was sculpted by the Indian sculptor V. Ganapati Sthapati, who also created the Iraivan Temple, and was unveiled on the millennium day of 1 January 2000 by the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. It is currently the 25th tallest statue in India. Description Portrait of Valluvar The combined height of the statue and pedestal is , denoting the 133 chapters of the Tirukkural. This includes sculpture of Valluvar standing upon a pedestal that represents the 38 chapters of Virtue, the first of the three books of the Kural text. The statue itself represents the second and third books of the Kural text, namely, Wealth and Love. The whole design signifies that wealth and love be earned and enjoyed on the foundation of solid virtue. The right hand of the statue with three fingers pointing skywards signifies the three cantos of the Kural text, namely, Aram, Porul, and Inbam (Virtue, Wealth, and Love, respectively), combined. The head of the statue stands at a height of above the sea level. The statue, with its slight bend around the waist is reminiscent of a dancing pose of the Hindu deities like Nataraja. The statue weighs . The monument is regarded as a cultural fusion because of its juxtaposition beside the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. Built-in conformation with traditional Indian architecture, the statue has provision to provide a hollow portion inside from toe to scalp. Visitors, however, will not be allowed to scale, but instead be permitted to climb up to the foot of the statue at a height of . Construction Thiruvalluvar Statue and the adjacent Vivekananda Rock Memorial at sunrise The project was conceived by then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in December 1975. On 15 April 1979, the then Prime Minister Morarji Desai laid the foundation stone for the statue, in the presence of the then Chief Minister, M. G. Ramachandran. However, the actual sculpting work, led by Dr. V. Ganapati Sthapati, former principal of the Government College of Architecture at Mahabalipuram, began a decade later on 6 September 1990, on the tiny island adjacent to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial when funds were allocated in the 199091 budget. Sthapathy was chosen for the project over 300 master builders because his suggestion for an all-stone monument to the poet-philosopher prevailed. He observed that stone would be more durable than metal, citing that the Statue of Liberty, which is made of copper, required extensive renovation just a century after its installation. Initially, the project stalled, perhaps owing to Karunanidhi's election loss, but then recommenced in 1997 when he returned to office. At the cost of more than , the project employed about 150 workers, sculptors, assistants and supervisors, who worked about 16 hours a day to complete the work. The bend around the waist depicting a dance pose made the design challenging. However, the problem was tackled well in advance by the sculptor by creating a full-length wooden prototype before construction. Study of this prototype led to the identification of an energy line (known in Vastu as kayamadhyasutra), currently an empty cavity in the center of the statue from top to bottom. The stonework was divided amongst three workshops, in Kanyakumari, Ambasamudram and Sholinganallur. Ambasamudram contributed of stones, while Sholinganallur was quarried for of high-quality granite stones for the outer portion of the statue. While the largest of the 3,681 stones were long and weighed over , the majority weighed . Stones of such proportions were previously used only in Mayan temples in South America. An interesting detail is a face, with the ears, nose, eyes, mouth, forehead all made of individual stones carved by hand. The work was done mostly by hand, with each carver wearing down 40 to 50 sharp chisels a day. The sculptors' team considered that the manual method on granite stones is the most dependable since machines may tend to break stones and precision is difficult. Stumps of palmyra tree and poles of casuarina (ironwood) were used for scaffolding. It took 18,000 casuarina poles tied together with two truckloads of ropes to reach the top of the statue. The statue was placed on its pedestal on 19 October 1999. The statue was unveiled on the millennium day of 1 January 2000. The statue was inaugurated on 1 January 2000 by Dr. M. Karunanidhi, the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Besides Indian political leaders and celebrities, foreign delegates including those from Malaysia, Singapore, and Sri Lanka, participated in the opening ceremony. Several Tamil teachers from the state of Tamil Nadu took out a rally from Kottaram to Kanyakumari carrying Tirukkural placards to mark the ceremony. More than fifty thousand people gathered for the event. The chief minister, after unveiling the statue, called it a \\"beacon of light to guide human life for all time to come.\\" The monument was hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004 but stood unaffected. The statue is designed to survive earthquakes of unexpected magnitude, such as magnitude 6 on the Richter Scale occurring within . This is far beyond that of any event recorded in the regional history because the bedrock in the region is ancient and without known local faults. Maintenance To prevent the statue from corrosion due to sea breeze, the statue is chemically treated once in four years. The salty deposits in every joint are removed and replaced with new cement mixture. Paper pulp is then applied on the whole of the statue. As the paper pulp coating dries, it absorbs the salty deposits completely, after which it is removed. The statue has been thus treated three times since its unveiling. The fourth treatment began on 17 April 2017 and is completed by 15 October 2017. Access The statue stands from the coastline of Kanyakumari on a small island rock. Ferry service are available from the mainland. The ferry service to Vivekananda Rock Memorial stops for a while at the Valluvar Statue. The Vivekananda Kendra has a proposal to connect the Valluvar memorial with the Vivekananda rock memorial by bridge to enable visitors to move easily from one island to the other.

Story Once upon a moment in time, there was kingdom known to all as Mythgard. Mythgard prospered in peace until the first coming of the Demon King, Jardine the Mad. Leading his Dark Legion, Jardine was but a step away from obliterating the kingdom... It was then that the Twelve Masters of the Elements rose up to put an end to the Demon King's evil designs. A fierce battle ensued until there remained but four masters opposing Jardine. Pooling their powers into a Holy Blade, the Four Masters prepared for the Final Battle...Jewel Master, inlay notes Gameplay The game is a side-scrolling action-adventure. It introduces the ability to constantly customize your attacks and movement styles through various equippable rings. Using the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" buttons as his left and right hands, you can then equip two rings to the corresponding hand. The \\"C\\" button is used for jumping. The nature of each attack varies greatly, and as a result, different attacks are suitable for different situations. A player familiar with the game can usually figure out which attack and combination of rings will be effective. For example, one enemy is weak to water and immune to fire, but other than this, enemies are not susceptible to specific elements. Levels * Forest Ruins: Once a great city, now overrun with goblins and golems lurking in every shadow. Even the wildlife that reside there have a thirst for blood. This stage marks the first challenge of many laid before the Jewel Master on his quest to overthrow the evil Jardine. From thick forests to decaying buildings, crossing the unforgiving land while doing battle with goblins, orcs, carnivorous plants and golems big and small, while dodging flesh-eating ravens and fish. No terrain is truly safe. * Desert Of Despair: A vast sea of sand and death riddled with quicksand and hungry sandworms, and the caverns that reside underneath. With the grueling heat and deadly foes, this desert will test any hero's survival skills to their limit. Facing locusts, scorpion rats, sandworms, living statues and reanimated skeletons, the only thing not in short supply... is danger. * Frozen Caverns: As The Jewel Master gets closer to Jardine's Castle, we see it takes a drastic effect on the environment. Once a lush forest full of life, now turned into a frozen wasteland, filled with Ice Demons, Frozen Hedgehogs, and even a Fearsome Yeti. As our hero travels through the frozen forest and across the solid lake, he enters the caverns. In here you are greeted with deadly electric jellyfish. You must venture forth through this frigid deathtrap filled with jagged frozen terrain, deadly falling stalactites, and pits filled with sharp stalagmites. * Crimson Valley: The Valley is one of the final trials of the Jewel Master. Filled with hundreds of goblins, golems, fire spitting statues, and armored birds. The falling rocks and broken bridges can make short work of The Jewel Master if you're not careful. * Castle Jardine: The Embodiment of Darkness itself. This is the final test for those who believe themselves to be true Jewel Masters. Filled with dark dragon statues, and Flail Swinging Skeletons, this is no playground. Before facing Jardine, the Jewel Master must fight the god of each element to test his strength. =Bosses= * Demon Panther (\\"Spier Tiger\\"): The White Tiger of the Forest Ruins. This is the first boss, and it will do everything in its power to prevent The Jewel Master from leaving the ruins alive. Jumps when the player is close, and charges when the player is far away. * Phoenix (\\"Firebird\\"): The second boss, and the ruler of the Desert of Despair. A bird set aflame that flies at high speeds. this is immune to fire but the player is safe in the far left of the screen. * Rock Carapace (\\"King Turtle\\"): Using its entire body to block the passage in the Frozen Caverns, this deadly turtle will spit beams of ice, and cause frozen rocks to fall and crush The Jewel Master. The player is safe and can attack with fire vipers from the far right of the turtles back. * DragonSpawn: The Final Guardian before Jardine's Castle. Using its immense size and speed, it can prove to be very challenging. The one thing this dragon is hungry for... is the flesh of The Jewel Master. * Chaos Dragon: Even after its defeat, the Dragon's rage lives on, causing its bones to reanimate for its final showdown against The Jewel Master. unlike the other bosses there is no real means of dodging its attacks and it takes a long time to kill, however if the player uses the jewel dropped by the chaos dragon to make \\"blade weapon\\" this boss can be defeated before it even starts attacking. Can be destroyed with regular attacks by attacking each bone segment approximately 12 times. * Demon King, Jardine the Mad: The true face of evil. He commands the darkest of spells, and only truly has one weakness (blade). This is the battle that decides the fate of The Jewel Master and all of Mythgard.

The species are characterized by a large alimentary system and sideways oriented antennas.  Etymology  The name is derived from Narao, the name of a group of small lakes in Cataract Brook canyon, above Hector on the Canadian Pacific Railway, British Columbia, Canada.Walcott, C.D. Middle Cambrian Branchiopoda, Malacostraca, Trilobita, and Merostomata. In: Cambrian Geology and Paleontology II. Smithsonian. 1914.s:Cambrian Geology and Paleontology/Volume 2/Middle Cambrian Branchiopoda, Malacostraca, Trilobita, and Merostomata  History of the classification  When the fossil was first discovered in Canada's Burgess Shale, it was believed to be a crustacean, such was the difference between this and other trilobites. Its continuous shield hid most of its structure, interfering with proper classification. When Harry B. Whittington began dissecting some specimens (Naraoia was among the most populous of the Burgess Shale animals), he discovered that the legs (and gills) of the beasts were very similar, if not identical to those of trilobites, thus the current placement of Naraoia in class Trilobita. Misszhouia longicaudata was formerly considered a member of the genus Naraoia, originally known as N. longicaudata, until separated in 1997.  Description  Naraoia compacta, retouched illustration from the original publication by Walcott. Note the appendages on the left Naraoia is almost flat (dorso- ventrally). The upper (or dorsal) side of the body consists of a non-calcified transversely oval or semi-circular headshield (cephalon), and a tailshield (pygidium) longer than the cephalon, without any body segments in between. The body is narrowed at the articulation between cephalon and pygidium. The long many-segmented antennas are directed sideways. There are no eyes. The gut has a relatively large diameter (14-18% of the width of the body), and next to four pairs of large digestive sacs (or caeca) the cephalon has branched diverticula occupying most of the cephalon (unlike in Misszhouia). Appendages with two branches on a common basis, like Misszhouia and trilobites. At least the anterior trunk limbs have exopods with large, paddle-shaped distal lobes and short flattened side branches (setae) on the shaft. The endopod (known only in N. compacta) is composed of six podomeres.Chen, J.-Y., G.D. Edgecombe and L. Ramskj√∂ld. Morphological and ecological disparity in naraoiids (Arthropoda) from the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Fauna, China. Records of the Australian Museum 49(1), pp. 1-24. 1997  Distribution  Naraoia taijiangensis Species of Naraoia are known from Canada, the United States, South China, and Australia, occurring in deposits ranging from the Lower Cambrian (Atdabanian) to the late Upper Silurian (Pridoli).  Ecology  Sediments present in the gut of Naraoia suggest that it may have been a deposit feeder, eating large amounts of soil, like an earthworm; A very large, complex system of gut diverticula and a gut with great holding capacity indicate that the diet of Naraoia spinosa was low in nutrition. On the other hand, the morphology of the digestive system has also been interpreted as representing a predatory habit. The large, paddle-shaped distal lobes and short lamellar setae on the exopods, the implanting of the antennas to the side, and the angle of the cephalon with the pygidium of up to 90¬∞ with which many specimen are found, all agree with a life of burrowing.

Brother Love's Underground was radio show in the late-60's that was dedicated to psychedelic and underground rock music. It originated from Pittsburgh radio station WAMO- FM, with Reeth being its psychedelic DJ and emcee. It was also aired, via tape, on Dynamic Broadcasting which owned WILD-AM in Boston, WUFO-AM in Buffalo and WOAH in Miami. While working at WAMO, which had a soul and R&B; format, Reeth got the idea to do a show promoting the growing psychedelic rock music scene, mostly based in San Francisco and LA. Like Tom Donahue, his west- coast counterpart, he was one of the first to introduce listeners to Iron Butterfly, Country Joe and the Fish, Mothers of Invention, the early Doors, Jimi Hendrix, West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, Vanilla Fudge and others. Although many of the artists on the show have been mainstays of classic rock stations for decades now, this was very adventurous radio programming at the time. Reeth was born in The Bronx, and moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania when he was a teenager. He was part of nightclub comedy team called Reeth & King and later a morning radio duo on WDRC in Hartford, Connecticut. He went on to WAMO in Pittsburgh and later to vice president of programming for Dynamic Broadcasting. He left Pittsburgh in 1973 for the west coast and bought KKAR, a country station in Pomona, where his on-air name was Romeo Jones. In his later years, Reeth posted some of his memories on Radio Nostalgia, a website devoted to Pittsburgh radio history. Reeth died from leukemia.

History =Founding through World War II (1918‚Äì1945)= Representatives from 14 higher education associations formed the Emergency Council on Education in 1918 in Washington, DC. They soon changed the name to the American Council on Education and appointed Donald J. Cowling, the head of the Association of American Colleges and president of Carlton College (MN), to be the first president. After World War I ended on November 11, 1918, ACE redirected itself to more expansive peacetime roles. ACE President Samuel P. Capen reexamined the missions, objectives, and processes of various institutions and helped spearhead a standardized, professional evaluation and accreditation system for institutions of higher learning in the United States. ACE assisted in drafting and adopting criteria that reflected the basic standards of a sound postsecondary education and developed peer evaluation procedures to ensure an institution's academic quality. In 1920, the Council published the first official listing of accredited higher education institutions. In 1920, ACE established the Committee on the Training of Women for Professional Service to raise the status of working women to professional levels. The committee published its research of women in the workplace in The Educational Record in 1922. In 1927, ACE became the first educational organization to promote standard measures of achievement and potential through psychological exams for high school students and college freshmen. The Council published American Universities and Colleges in 1928, which offered information to students, parents, advisors, and educators on all accredited colleges and universities that offered a baccalaureate degree. Following the stock market crash in 1929, the 1930s saw decreased education options and labor markets. While the number of high school-age students increased by 2 million between 1930 and 1940, young people had fewer opportunities than ever before. In 1935, ACE organized the American Youth Commission to address the plight of millions of school-age adolescents. In 1938, ACE began studying the effects of racism on black children in the United States and published a series of reports on equal opportunity in education, including Children of Bondage: The Personality Development of Negro Youth in the Urban South by Allison Davis and John Dollard (1940) and Growing Up in the Black Belt: Negro Youth in the Rural South by Charles Spurgeon Johnson (1941). In 1942, the Council spearheaded the General Educational Development (GED) test, a series of standardized exams used to measure a service member's proficiency in science, mathematics, social studies, reading, and writing among those who did not complete high school. That same year, ACE also developed the Military Evaluations Program to accurately award college credit for various military courses and training. The Council also helped draft and then lobbied for the passage of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, known as the GI Bill. =Post-War through Civil Rights Era (1946‚Äì1975)= In 1946, President Harry Truman asked ACE President George F. Zook to chair the 28-member Presidential Commission on Higher Education charged with reexamining the United States' system of colleges and universities ‚Äúin terms of its objectives, methods, and facilities; and in the light of the social role it has to play.‚Äù The Truman Commission, often called the Zook Commission, was the first time a U.S. president had asked for a national look at higher education, an area previously left to local and state governments. Also in 1946, ACE worked to support the creation and passage of Senator J. William Fulbright‚Äôs scholarship program, intended to advance mutual understanding of U.S. democracy both at home and overseas. Later that year, at President Truman's urging, ACE helped establish the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which provides international exchange opportunities for American scholars and administrators. In 1947, ACE, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the College Entrance Examination Board formed the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to streamline the educational assessment process. In 1949, ACE released a survey of college admission practices titled On Getting Into College, which found widespread admission discrimination against black, Jewish, and Catholic students. With the onset of the Cold War and the Korean War in 1951, ACE convened the Conference on Women in the Defense Decade. ACE then established the Commission on the Education of Women (CEW) to research and clarify issues related to women's higher education. Operating from 1953 to 1962, CEW issued two publications: How Fare American Women? in 1955 and The Span of a Woman‚Äôs Life and Learning in 1960. Both challenged the traditional notion that a liberal arts or home economics track was sufficient for women pursuing a postsecondary degree. In 1962, ACE formed the Committee on Equality of Educational Opportunity in the wake of issues that were raised during the integration of the University of Mississippi. Two years later, ACE established the Office of Urban Affairs, which evolved into the Office of Minorities in Higher Education. In 1964, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson asked ACE to assist in crafting language and policy for a piece of legislation to expand federal aid to all qualified students seeking higher education, which became the Higher Education Act of 1965. The passage of Title IX in 1972 barring sex- based discrimination served as the impetus for ACE's creation of the Office of Women in Higher Education. The office was designed to help ACE's members interpret legislation, eliminate discriminatory practices, and increase women's participation at all levels of higher education‚Äîfrom students to professors to administrators. =End of the 20th Century (1976‚Äì2000)= ACE helped define higher education's response to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibited discrimination against individuals with disabilities. For secondary education, this included discrimination in recruitment, testing, admissions, and treatment after admissions. To foster results after the legislation's delayed implementation in 1977, ACE conducted a national survey of college freshmen who self-identified as disabled and then recommended accommodations and services to its member institutions. In 2000, ACE created the Higher Education and the Handicapped Resource Center (HEATH) to serve as the national clearinghouse of information regarding technical assistance in disability access. In 1977, ACE's Office of Women in Higher Education launched the National Identification Program for the Advancement of Women in Higher Education, known as ACE/NIP. Its objective was to identify talented women and enhance their visibility as leaders by holding national, state, and regional forums that addressed key leadership issues such as finance and ethics in education, the role of trustees, and importance of diversity to the educational mission. In 1981, the Council created the Office of Minorities in Higher Education (OMHE) to help address the need for diversity in higher education. In 1982, ACE published the first of its annual status reports on minorities in higher education; five years later, the Council created the Commission on Minority Participation in Education and American Life. In 1986, ACE conducted a national study to determine who the leaders of colleges and universities leaders were, what paths they had taken to the office, and what trends were impacting their role. ACE published the results the following year in the first edition of its American College President Study. ACE created the National Center for Academic Achievement and Transfer (NCAAT) in 1989, which identified factors affecting student transfers to four-year institutions. A series of NCAAT studies published through 1992 examined ways community college curriculums could improve content, structure, and portability to best facilitate students' pursuit of a four-year degree. ACE initiated the College Is Possible campaign in 1998 to bring awareness to the variety of scholarships, low-interest loans, and grants available to students of all academic and financial backgrounds. =The New Millennium (2001‚ÄìPresent)= In an effort led by Dartmouth College's (NH) President James Wright, ACE assisted Senator Jim Webb (D-VA) in drafting the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, which expanded higher education benefits to veterans of 9/11 military service and their immediate families. ACE also assisted Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii in drafting the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, which amended and improved the 2008 legislation, including benefits for some National Guard service members. With donations from private contributors, the Council began a seven-year effort in 2007 to provide academic support to more than 750 severely injured service members through a program called Severely Injured Military Veterans: Fulfilling Their Dreams (SIMV). SIMV provided support services to service members, veterans, and their family members during their recovery at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. After implementing Solutions for Our Future, a three-year campaign about the importance of higher education in society, ACE worked with the Ad Council and the Lumina Foundation to create 2007‚Äôs KnowHow2GO, a program designed to help low-income, first-generation middle school students prepare for college. In 2011, ACE launched the American College Application Campaign, a national initiative conducted state by state to assist low-income, first- generation high school seniors to complete and submit at least one college application. That same year, ACE helped convene the National Commission on Higher Education Attainment to improve college student retention and degree completion. ACE has filed more than 200 amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs over the years. Among them are submissions in 2003 to the U.S. Supreme Court in the University of Michigan's Grutter v. Bollinger case, and in 2013 and 2015 in the Court's two reviews of lower court rulings in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. In 2013, ACE President Molly Corbett Broad, along with 15 other higher education leaders, was invited by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators to be a part of the Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education. William E. Kirwan, then chancellor of the University System of Maryland, and Nicholas S. Zeppos, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, co- chaired the task force, while ACE was requested to provide staff support. The culminating report, Recalibrating Regulation of Colleges and Universities, was released in 2015.

Farming career Hilton was from a Norfolk family and was born in South Walsham. He attended an elementary school in Upton only before going to work as an agricultural labourer. He was an athletic youth who enjoyed playing football, including for the Norfolk county team in 1932. He was also a Methodist lay preacher from 1932. A member of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, he served as Swaffham Area Organiser for the union. Labour Party official In 1936 Hilton, who was an active supporter of the Labour Party, became a full-time Party Agent for East Norfolk Constituency Labour Party. He was responsible for organising the campaign in the East Norfolk by-election of 1939. During the Second World War, Hilton served in the Royal Army Service Corps with the rank of Corporal. He married Nelly Simmons in 1944; they had two sons, both of whom predeceased him. Trade Union official and councillor After the end of the war, Hilton moved on from the Labour Party to become an official of the National Union of Agricultural Workers. He was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in 1949, becoming Vice Chairman of the Swaffham Magistrates, and in 1951 was elected to Norfolk County Council. By-election candidate The sitting Labour MP for the marginal South West Norfolk constituency, Sidney Dye, was killed in a car accident in December 1958. Hilton was chosen to defend the 193 vote majority in the seat, the first time he had fought a Parliamentary election. With a largely agricultural constituency, he concentrated on issues such as land nationalisation and abolition of tied cottages, and succeeded in winning by 1,354 votes. However, in the general election only a few months later, Hilton squeaked in by only 78 votes. Political position Hilton proved a generally loyal MP. In his first months, he signed a motion opposing the stockpiling of United States nuclear weapons in the United Kingdom; on hearing that this stance was not endorsed by the leadership, he withdrew his signature. In the 1960 leadership election, he publicly backed Hugh Gaitskell. He remained involved in his union and in May 1960 was elected as first Vice President; at the end of 1960 Hilton was part of a six-member delegation to Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In October 1961, Hilton was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party from the trade union section, replacing the previous nominee of the National Union of Agricultural Workers. In the 1963 Labour Party conference, he replied on behalf of the NEC to a debate on tied cottages, and accepted that a Labour government would make it impossible to evict the tenant of a tied cottage without providing alternative accommodation. Defeat Hilton's agricultural constituency was trending away from Labour, against the national swing. At the 1964 general election, he was defeated by the Conservatives. He replaced Edwin Gooch, who had been Labour MP for North Norfolk until his death, as President of the National Union of Agricultural Workers. He was appointed as government member of the board of the British Sugar Corporation Ltd in 1965, and later that year on 11 May was created a life peer, taking the title Baron Hilton of Upton, of Swaffham in the County of Norfolk. House of Lords He served as a Lord in Waiting (junior whip) in the House of Lords from 1966. He was also appointed to the East Anglia Economic Planning Council in 1966, and served as Chairman of the National Brotherhood Movement within the Methodist Church in 1967. In 1971, Lord Hilton broke the whip to vote in support of the British application to join the European Communities.

The brand name is now also used for a range of epoxy and bismaleimide adhesives manufactured by Hexcel. The name is a contraction of REsearch at DUXford. History Devised at ARL by Dr. Norman de Bruyne and George Newell in 1941 for use in the aircraft industry, the adhesive is used for the bonding of metal-to-metal and metal-to- wood structures. The adhesive system comprises a liquid phenolic resin and a PVF (PolyVinylFormal) thermoplastic powder. The first formulation available was Redux Liquid E/Formvar, comprising a phenolic liquid (Redux Liquid E) and a PVF powder (Formvar), and after its initial non-aviation related application of bonding clutch plates on Churchill and Cromwell tanks, it was used by de Havilland from 1943 to the early 1960s, on, among other aircraft, the Hornet, the Comet and the derived Nimrod, and the Dove, Heron and Trident. It was also used by Vickers on the Viking and by Chance Vought on the F7U Cutlass. Typically, Redux would be used to affix stiffening stringers and doublers to wing and fuselage panels, the resulting panel being both stronger and lighter than a riveted structure. In the case of the Hornet it was used to join the aluminium lower-wing skin to the wooden upper wing structure, and in the fabrication of the aluminium/wood main wing spar, both forms of composite construction made possible by the advent of Redux. After initially supplying de Havilland only, ARL subsequently produced a refined form of Redux Liquid E/Formvar using a new liquid component known as Redux Liquid K6, and a finer- grade (smaller particle-size) PVF powder, and this was later made generally available to the wider aircraft industry as Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775, so- named because it was sold for aircraft use to specification DTD 775*. Available for general non-aerospace use it was called Redux Liquid K6/Powder C. Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775 was joined in 1954 by the subsequent Redux Film 775 system, used from 1962 by de Havilland (later Hawker Siddeley and subsequently British Aerospace) on the DH.125 and DH.146. Other users included Bristol (on the Britannia), SAAB (on the Lansen & Draken), Fokker (on the F.27), Sud Aviation (on the Alouette II/III), Breguet and Fairchild, the film- form having the advantage of greater gap-filling ability with no loss of strength over Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775, allowing for wider tolerances in component-fit, as well as easier handling and use and controlled ratios of the liquid/powder components. Other Redux adhesives available included \\"Redux 64\\", a solution of the phenolic liquid and PVF powder, used worldwide for bonding linings to brake shoes, pads and clutches. The Redux range was subsequently expanded to include the current range of adhesives, both in single and two part paste systems and film forms, for both aerospace and industrial uses. * DTD = Directorate of Technical Development Usage To use Redux in its liquid/powder form, a thin film of the phenolic liquid is applied to both mating surfaces and then dusted with or dipped in the PVF powder to give an approximate ratio by weight of 1 part liquid to 2 parts powder. The coated joints are then allowed to stand for not less than 30 minutes and not more than 72 hours before the components are brought together under elevated pressure and temperature. The curing process is by condensation and a typical figure for Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775 is 30 minutes at 145 ¬∞C (293 ¬∞F) under a pressure of 100 lbf/in2 (690 kPa). This is not critical and variations in curing-time and/or temperature may be used to increase shear and creep strength at temperatures above 60 ¬∞C (140 ¬∞F). Extending the curing cycle gives benefits in fatigue strength at some cost in the room-temperature peel strength, the practical limit for aluminium alloys being approx 170 ¬∞C (338 ¬∞F) for one hour, due to the possibility of affecting the alloy's mechanical properties. Performance (typical) Redux 775 *Lap shear strength at ambient temperature = 34.0 MPa (4,930 lbf/in2) *Young's Modulus (E) = 3.35 GPa (486,000 lbf/in2) *Shear modulus = 1.20 GPa (174,000 lbf/in2) Strength of bonds to materials other than aluminium: Tensile shear of 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) lap joints at room temperature: *Bright mild steel of thickness 0.0625 in (1.6 mm) - mean failing stress = 4,980 lbf/in2 (33.7 MPa, 3.50 kgf/mm2) *Stainless steel of thickness 0.048 in (1.2 mm) - mean failing stress = 5,600 lbf/in2 (38.6 MPa, 3.94 kgf/mm2) *Magnesium alloy1 of thickness 0.063 in (1.6 mm) - mean failing stress = 3,210 lbf/in2 (22.1 MPa, 2.26 kgf/mm2) *Commercially- pure titanium2 of thickness 0.050 in (1.3 mm) - mean failing stress = 4,070 lbf/in2 (28.1 MPa, 2.86 kgf/mm2) 1 = HK31A-H24 2 = ICI Titanium 130 See also *Araldite * Aerolite * Tego film References *Project 3 ‚Äì Environmental Durability of Adhesive Bonds ‚Äì Report No. 9 ‚Äì Forensic Studies of Adhesive Joints ‚Äì Part 2 Bonded Aircraft Structure by A.

(2014). Buccinum Linnaeus, 1758. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=137701 on 2015-02-18 Snails in this genus are commonly called whelks, a name shared with several related and unrelated species. The common whelk Buccinum undatum is the most common representative of the genus in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Description The shell is ovate or ovate-conical and elongated. The spire is moderate and pointed. The aperture is oval or oblong with a deep notch anteriorly and without a siphonal canal. The columella is plain, not flattened, swollen above, and often covered with a wide and flattened calcareous callosity, of more diaphanous substance. There sometimes exists a fold at the base of the columella. The outer lip is plain, quite thin, sometimes recurved, and forming a margin on the exterior. The thin, horny operculum is ovate and concentrically striate. The soft body is elongated and spiral. The foot almost always considerable and subelliptical. It is shielded or two-lobed before, emarginated behind, bearing an operculum. The mantle is simple and forms a thin-edged flap over the branchial cavity. It is provided with a branchial siphon, projecting, thick, very long and dorsal, issuing from the emargination at the base of the shell. The head is rather thick, furnished with two conical, depressed tentacles supporting the eyes upon the outer side, (sometimes the eyes do not exist, but this case is extremely rare) . The mouth is provided with a retractile trunk, armed with minute teeth. The radula acts as a rasp. The sexes are separate. The love dart of the male is considerable, without an exterior furrow at its base. Buccinum labiatum, a fossil species from the Eocene of the Isle of Wight All animals are carnivores and scavengers, feeding on dead or damaged marine animals. They are provided with a cylindrical trunk, susceptible of being much elongated or of being concealed entirely within the body. This trunk is armed at its extremity with beaks, which enable the animal to pierce the shell of other molluscs and crustaceans, upon which it preys.Macgillivray, William, History of the molluscous animals of Scotland, London, 1844 The sexes are separate. The shells of the males are generally smaller, and less inflated than those of the females. The males are provided with a very large love dart, i.e. an exciting appendage, which, in a state of repose, is situated under the right edge of the mantle. The eggs are generally united together. They are sometimes driven and transported by the waves to distances far removed from the places where they had been deposited; whence the same species of Buccinum are often found in very different climates. Distribution The whelks are met with in all seas, especially upon rocks, where they occur in large numbers. The warmest climates furnish the species most brilliant in coloring. Some species serve for food to the inhabitants of many countries, particularly upon the shores of the English Channel and the North Sea.

Depending on context the term may also refer to listed company (quarterly) earnings guidance. For a country or economy, see Economic forecast. Typically, using historical internal accounting and sales data, in addition to external industry data and economic indicators, a financial forecast will be the analyst's modeled prediction of company outcomes in financial terms over a given time period.

Arguably, the key aspect of preparing a financial forecast is predicting revenue; future costs, fixed and variable, as well as capital, can then be estimated as a function of sales via \\"common-sized analysis\\" - where relationships are derived from historical financial ratios and other accounting relationships. At the same time, the resultant line items must talk to the business' operations:- in general, growth in revenue will require corresponding increases in working capital, fixed assets and associated financing; and in the long term, profitability (and other financial ratios) should tend to the industry average; see Valuation using discounted cash flows #Determine cash flow for each forecast period for more detailed discussion, and other considerations.

As a collegian, Coach Weichers left football to take up boxing. He eventually won the 190-pound championship for West Chester University in 1973. He started as an assistant coach at his alma mater when, in 1976, was offered the coaching job at the Air Force Academy.Karl Licis, Knockout program: AFA Boxing Coach Celebrates 25 Years of Success, Colorado Springs Gazette, Mar. 2, 2002 Under Coach Weichers' leadership, the Academy has produced 258 All-American boxers, 96 individual national champions, and 18 national championship teams. For 27 years, from 1980 to 2007, his teams never finished lower than second in the nation. Weichers has conducted coaching seminars throughout the world, including clinics in Australia, Guatemala, New Zealand, Jamaica, Tahiti and Granada. While working as a boxing clinician for the Olympic Solidarity Boxing Program, he was selected to coach the Australian Olympic Boxing team, which competed in the 1984 games in Los Angeles. He also served as trainer and coach for Australia's professional world champions, Jeff Fenech and Jeff Harding. He has served as president and vice-president of the National Collegiate Boxing Association (NCBA). Originally from New Orleans, Weichers holds a Bachelor of Science degree in health and physical education from West Chester and a master's in arts and sports sciences from the University of Denver. In addition to coaching, he is also an associate professor in the physical education department at the Air Force Academy.

Especially designed for Arctic operations, Point Barrow was constructed along the general lines of a landing ship dock, but with strengthened hull and bow, and special insulation. After providing logistic support for U.S. forces in the Arctic, in 1962, Point Barrow transported huge fixed array radar antennas for the USS Enterprise and USS Long Beach to the East Coast. After extensive modification in June, 1965 Point Barrow carried Saturn rockets from California to Cape Kennedy for NASA‚Äôs manned space flight program. T‚ÄìAKD‚Äì1 also ferried LCMs to Southeast Asia in 1968 and 1969. Reclassified a \\"Deep Submergence Support Ship\\" and renamed USS Point Loma (AGDS-2) circa 1974, she was ultimately placed out of service and struck from the Naval Vessel Register 28 September 1993. Custody was transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay in Benecia, California. Point Loma was scrapped by Marine Metal Inc. of Brownsville, Texas on 27 October 2006.

A reclining lady with a fan, 1876, watercolor and black chalk on paper, heightened with white Biography Pagliano was born in Casale Monferrato in the Kingdom of Sardinia and studied at the Brera Academy in Milan until 1848. He initially trained with Giuseppe Sogni, then under the neoclassic painter Luigi Sabatelli. He began his artistic career with paintings in a distinctly Neoclassical style, but very quickly he was won over to Romanticism, as championed then in Milan by Hayez and Tranquillo Cremona. He painted the Death of Luciano Manara. He again joined the Risorgimento included joining the popular revolt against the Austrian garrison in Milan known as the cinque giornate of 1848. He joined the Bersaglieri di Manara in the defense of the Republic of Rome in 1848, but returned to painting by 1851. The urge to battle resumed in 1859, when he rejoined the army fighting in Lombardy. Again returning to art after his stint in the militias, he painted Presa del cimitero di Solferino, a battle in which he participated. Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 344. In 1872, his painting of Maramaldo (referring to Fabrizio Maramaldo), awarded a prize at the Milan Exhibition, was sold to the Khedive of Egypt. Pagliano also won prizes for works at the 1867 Exhibitions of Parma, Turin, and Paris, and a gold medal at the Berlin Exhibition. Among his main works are: La Ragione di Stato (Reasons of State); The Divorce of Napoleon I; Tintoretto paints his dead daughter's portrait; L'inventario (The inventory); La lezione di geografia (Geography Lesson); San Luigi, and the large canvas of Il passaggio del Ticino (1859) commissioned by Antonio Traversi of Verona. He painted large tempera paintings for the first class waiting room at the train station of Milan. He also helped decorate theaters in Como and Verona. He was made an official in the Order of the Crown of Italy, Knight of the Order of Saints Maurizio e Lazzaro, knighted by King Leopold of Belgium, and knighted with the Legion d'Onore, and as a Commendatore of the Order of the Medjidie by the Ottoman rulers of Egypt. Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 345-346. Other painters who joined Garibaldi were Giuseppe Sogni, Gerolamo Induno, Paolo Calvi, and Sebastiano de Albertis. His artworks too‚Äîincluding a portrait of Garibaldi and a six-meter-wide painting (pictured) of the disembarkment of Garibaldi and his ‚ÄúHunters of the Alps‚Äù at Sesto Calende on Lake Maggiore‚Äîreflected his patriotic involvement in the Italian Wars of Independence. Later in his life, Pagliano became a teacher and counted among his pupils the painters Pompeo Mariani, Spartaco Vela, and Uberto Dell‚ÄôOrto. Eleuterio Pagliano died in Milan at the age of 75. During his lifetime his paintings had failed to make a great stir; however, his reputation increased when, shortly after his death, an exhibition in his honor was mounted in Milan.

The shiny dark-green leaves are in spiral arrangement, ovoid in shape. The flowers are fragrant, possessing a white tubular five-lobed corolla about in diameter, with a pink to red throat. They have five stamens and the ovary is positioned above the other flower parts. The fruits are egg-shaped, long, and turn bright red at maturity. Description left Cerbera manghas is naturally distributed from the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean eastward to French Polynesia. It occupies coastal habitats and is often associated with mangrove forests. This tree has been introduced to Hawaii and other tropical locations as an ornamental. Poison The leaves and the fruits contain the potent cardiac glycoside cerberin, which is extremely poisonous if ingested. People in olden times used the sap of the tree as a poison for animal hunting. In Madagascar, the seeds were used in ordeals called tangena, with often deadly results. The fruit was reportedly eaten to commit suicide in the Marquesas Islands (Whistler, W. A. 1992. Flowers of the Pacific Island Seashore). In Hawaii, Cerbera manghas is sometimes called \\"suicide apple\\". Mythology Because of its deadly poisonous seeds, the genus name is derived from Cerberus, the hell dog from the Greek mythology, thus indicating the toxicity of the seeds. In Madagascar, the seeds were used in sentence rituals to poison kings and queens. Uses In Sri Lanka, this wood is used for making masks particularly because it is a light wood. Used for making bio-insecticides & deodorants.

Further layoffs occurred in October 2017, including the entire staff of Live Audio Wrestling (which the network claimed was on a \\"hiatus\\").

Representatives of this family have been found in the paleocontinents of Avalonia, Baltica, and Gondwana, now Canada (Nova-Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland), USA (Massachusetts, South Carolina), England, Wales, Morocco, Spain, Czech Republic, Poland, Russia (Novaya Zemlya, Northern Siberia, North-East Yakutia), Mongolia, and Turkey. Species in this family can typically grow large to very large (over 30 cm), are relatively flat, have an inverted egg-shaped outline, opisthoparian sutures, a glabella that in early genera has parallel sides and expands forward in later representatives, and approaches or reaches the frontal border. All species have an almost semicircular headshield (or cephalon) with long backward-directed genal spines. The articulate middle part of the body (or thorax) consists of 15 to 21 segments ending in sickle-shaped spines that to the back curve increasingly further backwards. The tailshield (or pygidium) is small.

The film stars Keiko Kitagawa and Yuika Motokariya in its lead roles. It is adapted from the manga Dear Friends by YOSHI, and art by Ayu Watanabe. The tagline for the film is \\"Are friends necessary?\\" The theme song is also called \\"Dear Friends\\", which is performed by Soulhead. Plot Dear Friends follows a high-school student named Rina (played by Keiko Kitagawa) who believes that friends are not necessary and that they can only be used in times of need. Thus, she is unable to maintain a decent relationship with her friends and classmates. Her family's relationship is also lacking; her father does not care much about his family and her mother is over-protective. Rina spends a lot of her time going to a club in Shibuya where Yousuke (played by Masaya Kikawada) is the disc jockey with her friends Hiroko (played by Airi Toriyama) and Emi (played by Hatsune Matsushima). (In the opening scene, Rina has \\"borrowed\\" Hiroko's boyfriend for sex, infuriating Hiroko.) Yousuke falls for Rina, but her attitude has a feral edge, and they neck but stop short of having sex. After obtaining a large amount of money under false pretenses (i.e. claiming she is pregnant when she is not and forcing the guy [not Hiroko's boyfriend or Yousuke] to pay for the abortion) and spending it on a bottle of Dom P√©rignon (which she sprays over everyone at the club), Rina collapses on the dance floor. She eventually discovers that she has cancer (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and becomes hospitalized for an indefinite amount of time. In the hospital, she is not visited by her family, but by one of her classmates named Maki (played by Yuika Motokariya). Although Maki tells Rina that they were friends in primary school, Rina does not remember her, so Maki takes the opportunity to re-connect with her. A young girl, Kanae, (played by Mao Sasaki) who is also hospitalized tries to become friends with Rina, but she holds fast onto her mantra of friends being unnecessary. Throughout her hospitalization, Rina begins to lose hope as her well-being falls apart. Her hair falls out from the chemotherapy and she looks pale and thin. Rina learns that Kanae also had cancer (leukemia), and has died after a bone marrow transplant failed. Rina must undergo a mastectomy as the cancer has spread to her left breast. She decides to commit suicide by jumping off the hospital's rooftop. Before she can jump, however, she is confronted by Maki, who stabs herself in the chest with a knife and declares that she will share the same pain as Rina and that she does not want to lose her friend. Maki has suicidal tendencies (as evidenced by scars on her wrist), but sees in her relationship with Rina a reason to keep living. Rina shows some hope again when she realizes that she can find friendship in Maki, but she does not see Maki while the latter recovers from the stab wound. Hiroko and Emi then visit Rina in the hospital ward. Hiroko throws away a love letter from Yousuke to Rina that she was supposed to deliver, then claims that she and Emi had three-way sex with him. Emi acknowledges this (even though it is new to her). After treatment, Rina is discharged. She tries to go back to her party lifestyle, but cannot force herself to behave as she once did. She goes back to the club, where Emi apologizes for the hospital visit (claiming that Hiroko put her up to it) and states that Hiroko overdosed on drugs. Rina decides she is ready to have sex with Yousuke, but he has second thoughts after seeing Rina's mastectomy scar. Rina goes back to the hospital rooftop to jump, but is stopped by the head nurse. The head nurse says that Maki wanted her to live, but Rina claims that Maki has not seen her recently. Then, another nurse pushes a zombie-like Maki in a wheelchair onto the rooftop. Maki says that the only reason she is still living is so that she could meet friends like Rina. Maki has a terminal illness: an unspecified neurodegenerative disease. Rina finds her purpose in life, fully recovered from cancer, applies to nursing school, becomes a nurse, and takes care of Maki during her final days. After three months, Maki dies.

She was the mother of her husband's successor and the second Chhatrapati, Sambhaji. Family Saibai was a member of the prominent Nimbalkar family, whose members were the rulers of Phaltan from the era of the Pawar dynasty and served the Deccan sultanates and the Mughal Empire. She was a daughter of the fifteenth Raja of Phaltan, Mudhojirao Naik Nimbalkar and a sister of sixteenth Raja, Bajaji Rao Naik Nimbalkar. Saibai's mother Reubai was from the Shirke family. Ravali from Andhra Pradesh being the current last grand daughter of Shivaji and Saibai. Marriage Saibai and Shivaji were married while still in their childhood on 16 May 1640 at Lal Mahal, Pune. The marriage was arranged by Shivaji‚Äôs mother, Jijabai, but was evidently not attended by his father, Shahaji nor his brothers, Sambhaji and Ekoji. Thus, Shahaji soon summoned his new daughter-in-law, Shivaji and his mother, Jijabai, to Bangalore, where he lived with his second wife, Tukabai. Saibai and Shivaji shared a close relationship with each other. She is said to have been a wise woman and a loyal consort to Shivaji. By all accounts, Saibai was a beautiful, good-natured and an affectionate woman. She is described as having been a \\"gentle and selfless person.\\" All of her endearing personal qualities, however, were a sharp contrast to Shivaji's second wife, Soyarabai, who was an intriguing lady. Yet, there is no record of any friction or mutual differences between Saibai and Shivaji's other wives. As long as Saibai was alive, she was an asset to Shivaji, not only regarding the affairs of the state, but also regarding the household affairs. She also had significant influence over her husband and the royal family as well. Saibai is reported to have acted as a counsel to Shivaji when he was invited by Mohammed Adil Shah, the king of Bijapur, for a personal interview. During Saibai's life time, the entire household of Shivaji bore a homogeneous atmosphere despite the fact that most of his marriages were performed due to political considerations. After Saibai's untimely death in 1659 followed by Jijabai's death in 1674, Shivaji's private life became clouded with anxiety and unhappiness. Although Soyarabai had gained prominence in the royal household following their deaths, she was not an affectionate consort like Saibai, whom Shivaji had dearly loved. Saibai remained Shivaji's favourite till he died. A great source of inspiration to him, legend has it that \\"Sai\\" was the last word he uttered on his deathbed. =Issue= During the course of their nineteen years of marriage, Saibai and Shivaji became parents of four children: Sakavarbai (nicknamed \\"Sakhubai\\"), Ranubai, Ambikabai and Sambhaji. Sakhubai was married to her first-cousin, Mahadji, the son of Saibai's brother, Bajaji Rao Naik Nimbalkar. This marriage took place in 1657 with an objective to consolidate Bajaji's return to Hinduism as he had been converted to Islam by the Mughal viceroy Aurangzeb. Ranubai married into the Jadhav family. Ambikabai married Harji Raje Mahadik in 1668. Saibai's fourth issue was her only son, Sambhaji, who was born in 1657 and was Shivaji's eldest son and thus, his heir-apparent. The birth of Sambhaji was an occasion of great joy and significance in the royal household for many different reasons. Death Saibai died in 1659 in Rajgad Fort while Shivaji maharaj was making preparations for his meeting with Afzal Khan at Pratapgad. She was ill from the time she gave birth to Sambhaji and her illness became serious preceding her death. Sambhaji was taken care by her trustworthy Dhaarau. Sambhaji was two years old at the time of his mother's death and was brought up by his paternal grandmother, Jijabai. Saibai's samadhi is situated at Rajgad Fort. In popular culture *Literature - Shivpatni Saibai, a biography of Saibai's life written by Dr. Sadashiv Shivade. *Television - In Colors TV's 2012 historical drama, Veer Shivaji, Saibai was portrayed by actress Palak Jain as a teenager and by Sonia Sharma as an adult.

Biography  Hooker grew up on the edge of the New Forest village of Pennington, about two miles north of Lymington.Writers in a Landscape, xi. After studying at the University of Southampton, Hooker lectured at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.Imagining Wales 188, 190. First living in Aberystwyth, but then in 1969 moving to the nearby Welsh- speaking parish of Llangwyryfon. Hooker left Llangwyrfron around 1980, when he spent two years as a creative writing fellow at Winchester School of Art.see Welsh Journal In 1984 he left the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Subsequently, he lived for a while in the Netherlands, teaching at the University of Groningen, before moving to Frome in 1989 and teaching creative writing at the Bath College of Higher Education. This later became Bath Spa University and he was the first director of its MA in Creative Writing. Jeremy Hooker spent the academic year 1994/5 teaching at Le Moine College in upstate New York.See Upstate: A North American Journal Exeter, Devon: Shearsman Books, 2007. More recently he was a Professor at the University of Glamorgan, from where he retired in 2008, becoming Emeritus Professor of the University.Enitharmon . Although retired Hooker remains active, continuing to publish poetry and prose, including contributions to various periodicals. Works He has published eleven full length collections of poetry (including selected and collected works), critical studies of John Cowper Powys and David Jones, as well as collections of literary essays. He has also edited works by Richard Jefferies, Edward Thomas, Frances Bellerby, Wilfred Owen. In addition Hooker has been involved with works for radio, including \\"A Map of David Jones\\".acknowledgements to \\"Our Lady in Europe\\". When asked, in an interview, about influences Hooker listed Richard Jeffries, Thomas Hardy, Edward Thomas and later David Jones, along with the American Objectivist poets William Carlos Williams and George Oppen.Brittle Star Magazine. Hooker began reading Jefferies when he was twelve.The Poetry of Place 170. Another important early influence was the fact that Hooker's father was a landscape painter, who had a great love of Constable.Writers in a Landscape, vii. The move to Wales in 1965 was important for Hooker's development both as poet and as critic,See \\"Introduction\\" to Imagining Wales. and during the 1970s he established himself as an important critic of Welsh writing in English (Anglo-Welsh literature) and was involved with teaching a course in Welsh writing in English, which had been created by Ned Thomas at Aberytwyth.Imagining Wales, 4. But the tension of being a \\"foreigner\\" in Wales led Hooker selling the house in Llangwyryfon, in 1980: \\"I owe no place more than Llangwyryfon, but it has taken eleven years of living there, in an agricultural and predominantly Welsh-speaking community, for us to realise that our particular kind of dislocation can't be mended by settling permanently where other people belong\\".Afterword\\" to A View from the Source. While living there he published three books of poetry that deal with his earlier experience of life in Southern England: Soliloquies of a Chalk Giant(1974) (winner in 1974 of the Welsh Arts Council Literature Prize), Landscape of the Daylight Moon (1978), Solent Shore (1978), and a fourth collection that focussed more on his experience of living in Wales: Englishman's Road (1980). A concern with place and landscape, in relation to personal identity, is central to both Hooker's poetry and to his critical writing, as is \\" the relation between poetry and the sacred\\".\\"Free Poetry\\" .

Family Miller's father, John Lucas Miller (1795‚Äì1838) and his uncle Stephen Decatur Miller both served as delegates to the Nullification Convention during the South Carolina Nullification Crisis of 1832‚Äì1833. His uncle also served as governor of South Carolina and United States Senator from South Carolina. Stephen Decatur Miller's daughter, and thus John Lucas Miller, Jr.'s cousin, was the noted Civil War diarist Mary Boykin Miller Chesnut. Legislator and lawyer Miller served in the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1853, when he was 22 years old. Miller was a native of York County, South Carolina and worked as an attorney in Yorkville, the county seat, for several years before the war. Civil War Miller volunteered for military service for the Confederate States of America at the beginning of the Civil War, and organized a volunteer infantry company. Initially serving as a captain in the Army of Northern Virginia, he commanded a unit of skirmishers on September 17, 1862, during the Battle of Antietam (called the Battle of Sharpsburg in the south), assigned to locate Union Army positions. After the Battle of Fredericksburg, he was promoted to colonel, and assigned to command the 12th South Carolina Infantry after the previous commander resigned. This unit was part of Colonel Abner Monroe Perrin's First Brigade of a division commanded by General William Dorsey Pender. Miller first led this unit at the Battle of Chancellorsville, and in the aftermath of this significant Confederate victory, was assigned to March 2000 Union prisoners to Richmond, Virginia. He completed this assignment without a single prisoner escaping. General Pender was killed during the Battle of Gettysburg in July, 1863. Although his regiment had 20 men killed at Gettysburg, Miller survived the defeat and helped organize the Confederate retreat. In the days that followed, the 12th Regiment lost another 18 men killed in the Battles of Hagerstown and Falling Water during the retreat from Gettysburg. Miller was killed at the Battle of the Wilderness along with 15 other men of his regiment. He was wounded by a minie ball in the bowels on May 5, 1864, and died in a field hospital before the following morning. It was said that he \\"commanded the respect of officers and men by his courage and conscientiousness, and acquired many friends by his affable and courteous deportment\\".

The preferred prey in greenhouses is the dark-winged fungus gnat (Sciaridae) This species is considered an important biological control mechanism against some plant pests, including fruit flies and other common greenhouse pests. It has also shown promise as a biological control agent of fungus gnats, shore flies.Hoebeke, E.R., Sensenbach, E.J., Sanderson, J.P., Wraight, S.P.

They had one UK hit single in 1966 with a cover of The Drifters' 1961 \\"Please Stay\\", written by Burt Bacharach and Bob Hilliard. Career The sextet was initially renamed from 'The Bumblies' which founded in 1963 in Liverpool, and was managed by Norman Eastwood. The Bumblies name came from a television programme starring Michael Bentine. The Bumblies comprised Charlie Crane (vocals), Joey Kneen (vocals), John Bennett (guitar), Phil Roberts (keyboards), George Robinson (bass guitar) and Charlie Gallagher (drums). Roberts and Kneen came from 'The Calderstones' that also featured Tom Evans (Badfinger). After recording their first single, The Bumblies' Bennett was replaced in early December 1965 by the then 16-year-old Ritchie Routledge from 'The Aztecs'; a semi-professional musician who was working as a junior reporter for Music Echo, a music paper owned by Brian Epstein. The band changed their name to 'The Cryin' Shames' and started working under the new name just before Christmas 1965. The Cryin' Shames first single, \\"Please Stay\\" was released on the Decca label on 18 February 1966. It was destined to be Joe Meek's final chart hit before he committed suicide in 1967 . \\"Please Stay\\" was a minor hit, peaking at #26 in the UK Singles Chart, and the band was approached by Epstein, who wanted to manage them, but they refused. The band had met Epstein in the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and turned down his offer. The line-up changed in May 1966, when Robinson was replaced by Derek Cleary on bass, who played on their second single release, \\"Nobody Waved Goodbye\\", which was released the following month. Crane and Routledge left The Cryin' Shames and formed a new band with a new name. With a line-up of Charlie [Paul] Crane, Ritchie Routledge (both vocals), Brian Norris (bass), Mike Espie (guitar), Pete Byrne (organ) and Paul Commerford (drums), they recorded one more single with Meek, \\"September in the Rain\\" / \\"Come On Back\\", which was released on 1 September 1966. It was issued under their new name of Paul and Ritchie and The Crying Shames. Routledge later led Blackwater Park, an English-German band in the early 1970s, and was part of Grimms. He also worked as a session singer for The Scaffold and appeared on the recording of the 1974 song \\"Liverpool Lou\\" (UK Number 7 - produced by Paul McCartney). Crane went on to be the lead singer of 'Gary Walker and The Rain'.

A later 1928 revision by Adkins removed it from the species C. latus while keeping it as a member of the genus Crioceras. In 1963, Young gave the species its final classification in a new genus, Allocrioceras, originally defined by Spath in 1926.  Biology  Allocrioceras was small compared to some Ammonites. Its shell diameter was only a bit larger than an U.S. quarter. Unlike most Ammonites its shell was partially uncoiled. Ammonites like this, with shell configurations differing from the typical tightly coiled spiral, are called Heteromorphs. It lived approximately 88 million years before present during the Turonian stage Cretaceous Period in what is now Texas. Its fossils can be found in the limestones of Brewster and Terrel counties. Its stomach contents and some soft parts have been found.  Distribution  Fossils of Allocrioceras have been found in Colombia (Loma Gorda Formation, Aipe, Huila),Patarroyo, 2011 France, Germany, Lebanon, South Africa, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Texas, Utah).Allocrioceras at Fossilworks.org  References  = Bibliography = * Category:Ammonitida genera Category:Heteromorphic ammonites Category:Turonian genus first appearances Category:Santonian genus extinctions Category:Ammonites of Africa Category:Cretaceous Africa Category:Late Cretaceous ammonites of Europe Category:Late Cretaceous ammonites of North America Category:Cretaceous United States Category:Ammonites of South America Category:Cretaceous Colombia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1926 ","title":"Allocrioceras"},{"id":"9901342","text":"Alloptychites is an extinct genus of cephalopods belonging to the Ammonite subclass.

There are analogs for generalizations of manifold, notably PL-manifolds and topological manifolds. There is also an analogue in homotopy theory for Poincar√© spaces, the Spivak spherical fibration, named after Michael Spivak. Construction via embeddings Given an embedding of a manifold in Euclidean space (provided by the theorem of Hassler Whitney), it has a normal bundle. The embedding is not unique, but for high dimension of the Euclidean space it is unique up to isotopy, thus the (class of the) bundle is unique, and called the stable normal bundle. This construction works for any Poincar√© space X: a finite CW-complex admits a stably unique (up to homotopy) embedding in Euclidean space, via general position, and this embedding yields a spherical fibration over X. For more restricted spaces (notably PL-manifolds and topological manifolds), one gets stronger data. =Details= Two embeddings i,i'\\\\colon X \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\R^m are isotopic if they are homotopic through embeddings. Given a manifold or other suitable space X, with two embeddings into Euclidean space i\\\\colon X \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\R^m, j\\\\colon X \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\R^n, these will not in general be isotopic, or even maps into the same space (m need not equal n). However, one can embed these into a larger space \\\\mathbf{R}^N by letting the last N-m coordinates be 0: :i\\\\colon X \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\R^m \\\\cong \\\\R^m \\\\times \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(0,\\\\dots,0)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\R^m \\\\times \\\\R^{N-m} \\\\cong \\\\R^N. This process of adjoining trivial copies of Euclidean space is called stabilization. One can thus arrange for any two embeddings into Euclidean space to map into the same Euclidean space (taking N = \\\\max(m,n)), and, further, if N is sufficiently large, these embeddings are isotopic, which is a theorem. Thus there is a unique stable isotopy class of embedding: it is not a particular embedding (as there are many embeddings), nor an isotopy class (as the target space is not fixed: it is just \\"a sufficiently large Euclidean space\\"), but rather a stable isotopy class of maps. The normal bundle associated with this (stable class of) embeddings is then the stable normal bundle. One can replace this stable isotopy class with an actual isotopy class by fixing the target space, either by using Hilbert space as the target space, or (for a fixed dimension of manifold n) using a fixed N sufficiently large, as N depends only on n, not the manifold in question. More abstractly, rather than stabilizing the embedding, one can take any embedding, and then take a vector bundle direct sum with a sufficient number of trivial line bundles; this corresponds exactly to the normal bundle of the stabilized embedding. Construction via classifying spaces An n-manifold M has a tangent bundle, which has a classifying map (up to homotopy) :\\\\tau_M\\\\colon M \\\\to B\\\\textrm{O}(n). Composing with the inclusion B\\\\textrm{O}(n) \\\\to B\\\\textrm{O} yields (the homotopy class of a classifying map of) the stable tangent bundle. The normal bundle of an embedding M \\\\subset \\\\R^{n+k} (k large) is an inverse u_M\\\\colon M \\\\to B\\\\textrm{O}(k) for \\\\tau_M, such that the Whitney sum \\\\tau_M\\\\oplus u_M \\\\colon M \\\\to B\\\\textrm{O}(n+k) is trivial. The homotopy class of the composite u_M\\\\colon M \\\\to B\\\\textrm{O}(k) \\\\to B\\\\textrm{O} is independent of the choice of inverse, classifying the stable normal bundle u_M. Motivation There is no intrinsic notion of a normal vector to a manifold, unlike tangent or cotangent vectors ‚Äì for instance, the normal space depends on which dimension one is embedding into ‚Äì so the stable normal bundle instead provides a notion of a stable normal space: a normal space (and normal vectors) up to trivial summands. Why stable normal, instead of stable tangent? Stable normal data is used instead of unstable tangential data because generalizations of manifolds have natural stable normal-type structures, coming from tubular neighborhoods and generalizations, but not unstable tangential ones, as the local structure is not smooth. Spherical fibrations over a space X are classified by the homotopy classes of maps X \\\\to BG to a classifying space BG, with homotopy groups the stable homotopy groups of spheres :\\\\pi_*(BG)=\\\\pi_{*-1}^S. The forgetful map B\\\\textrm{O} \\\\to BG extends to a fibration sequence :B\\\\textrm{O} \\\\to BG \\\\to B(G/\\\\textrm{O}). A Poincar√© space X does not have a tangent bundle, but it does have a well-defined stable spherical fibration, which for a differentiable manifold is the spherical fibration associated to the stable normal bundle; thus a primary obstruction to X having the homotopy type of a differentiable manifold is that the spherical fibration lifts to a vector bundle, i.e., the Spivak spherical fibration X \\\\to BG must lift to X \\\\to B\\\\textrm{O}, which is equivalent to the map X \\\\to B(G/\\\\textrm{O}) being null homotopic Thus the bundle obstruction to the existence of a (smooth) manifold structure is the class X \\\\to B(G/\\\\textrm{O}). The secondary obstruction is the Wall surgery obstruction. Applications The stable normal bundle is fundamental in surgery theory as a primary obstruction: *For a Poincar√© space X to have the homotopy type of a smooth manifold, the map X \\\\to B(G/\\\\textrm{O}) must be null homotopic *For a homotopy equivalence f\\\\colon M \\\\to N between two manifolds to be homotopic to a diffeomorphism, it must pull back the stable normal bundle on N to the stable normal bundle on M.

In 1968, Usdan Summer Camp for the Arts opened its gates to 1,000 students. Today, approximately 1,600 \\"Usdanites,\\" ages 4‚Äì18, from across Long Island, New York City and lower Westchester, attend the camp every year.  Programs and classes  The camp is organized into divisions based on grade level: Discovery (Pre-K and 1); Partners In the Arts (2 and 3); Junior (4 through 6); and Senior (6 through 12). Students have a choice of classes from the following disciplines: art, chess, dance, creative writing, music, or theater. They choose a \\"major\\" (two 50-minute periods) and a \\"minor\\" (one period) activity. The schedule is based around these two activities along with a recreation period, lunch and a daily Usdan Festival Concerts throughout his or her entire three- four- or seven-week camp session. Over the years, Usdan's curriculum of music, art, dance, and theater has expanded into additional fields of study in the arts. The camp now offers classes including creative writing, video arts, 3D design and printing, chess, jazz and tap dance, nature, organic gardening, fashion design, cartooning, architecture, animation, ukulele and guitar, Quidditch, and more. In 2016, the camp launched the Usdan Leadership Institute for the Arts. Tailored for Usdan's high school students (current 9th - 12th graders), the program is designed to cultivate thoughtful, independent young artists and the next generation of leaders in the arts. Members receive leadership training twice a week and have the opportunity to mentor younger students or pursue a job position, depending on eligibility, interest, and availability.  Alumni  Notable alumni include singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, actress Natalie Portman; actress Olivia Thirlby; jazz singer Jane Monheit; actor Larry Saperstein; dancer Dara Adler, TV personality Stacy London; Broadway playwright Michele Lowe; Broadway personality Seth Rudetsky; Juilliard conductor Adam Glaser; and members of major American orchestras, and dance and theater companies.Children's literature editor, writer, and founder of publishing company,Levine Querido, Arthur A Levinehttps://www.levinequerido.com/meet-the-team is also a former \\"Usdanite.\\"  Campus  The Usdan Campus is composed of 140 acres of woodlands and, over the camp's five-plus decades, three noted architectural firms have shaped the landscape. Today, students have access to close to 70 studios and theaters, including the Andrew and Lily McKinley Amphitheater‚Äîa 1,000-seat, award-winning campus center that hosts Usdan‚Äôs daily Festival Concerts. Other major campus buildings include: the Samuel and Lucille Lemberg Drama Center, the Jerrold Ross Discovery Center, and the Maurice B. Hexter Center. The campus also has four modern tennis courts, three large outdoor swimming pools, two yoga platforms, an archery range, a Quidditch field, and a recreation area for basketball and other games. History In the mid-1960s, Dr. Maurice B. Hexter, the executive vice president of Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, was captivated by a singular concept: arts education in a camp setting, where fun, creativity, and learning intermingle freely in the beautiful outdoors. He and Andrew McKinley, a musician and renowned concert artist, opera singer, and member of Juilliard‚Äôs faculty, enlisted the partnership of philanthropist Samuel Lemberg, who provided initial funding for the project, and named it after his beloved daughter Suzanne Usdan. The Nathaniel and Suzanne Usdan Center for the Creative and Performing Arts (now known as Usdan Summer Camp for the Arts) was born. To bring their vision to fruition, Dr. Hexter and Mr. Lemberg enlisted an committee of artists and educators, including Mr. McKinley, the camp‚Äôs founding executive director, and Dr. Jerrold Ross, the chairman of the Department of Music Education at New York University, who was appointed Usdan‚Äôs education director. Together, this team attracted a faculty of prominent artists and teachers from the country‚Äôs leading conservatories and universities‚Äîa tradition that continues to this day. It was Suzanne who coined the phrase in the early days of Usdan that remains a camp mantra to this day: \\"Lose yourself for the summer. Find yourself for a lifetime.\\" Mr. McKinley continued to serve as executive director until his retirement in 1983, when he was followed by Dale Lewis. Mr. Lewis served the camp for 32 years, before stepping down in 2015. He was succeeded by Usdan‚Äôs current executive director, Lauren Brandt Schloss. In 2008, Usdan celebrated its 40th season. In 2018, the Camp celebrated its 50th anniversary summer.  Leadership and faculty  The camp was founded in 1968 by Dr. Maurice B. Hexter, the executive vice president of Federation of Jewish Philanthropies; musician and opera singer Andrew McKinley; along with philanthropist Samuel Lemberg, who provided initial funding for the project. Mr. McKinley became the camp‚Äôs founding executive director, a position he held for 16 years. Upon his retirement, the Usdan Board appointed cellist and educator Dale Lewis as his successor. Mr. Lewis held that role until he stepped down in 2015. He is currently Executive Director Emeritus. In 2015, Arts Educator Lauren Brandt Schloss, the camp's current executive director joined Usdan. Usdan's leadership includes its Board of Trustees, and a Leadership Council of Long Island community and business leaders. As of January 2019, Usdan Board of Trustees members include: Lillian Z. Cohen (Treasurer); Richard Eisenberg; Roslyn Jaffe; Michele Lowe (Secretary); Robert Nederlander, Jr.; Lesley Friedman Rosenthal; Dr. Jerrold Ross (Past President); and John Usdan (President). And Usdan Leadership Council include: Marilyn & Russell Albanese; Shari Alexander; Amanda Fugazy & Scott Brennan; Sheree & James Incorvaia; Angela Jaggar; Irene & Peter J. Klein; Rosemarie Klipper; Kirk Kordeleski; Sandra & Eric Krasnoff; Debra & Dale Lewis; Jane Monheit & Rick Montalbano; Joy & John Racanelli; Jennifer & Jonathan Allan Soros. Since the Center's inception, the Board has completed capital campaigns to build state-of-the-arts theaters and teaching studios on Usdan's 140-acre woodland campus.

When he was nine years old, Roberts took up learning to play the violin and gained a violin scholarship to Felsted School in Essex. At the same time he also developed a talent for playing guitar, and became a member of various school bands. In 1965 he went to Liverpool University to study Law, and whilst there teamed up with poet Roger McGough, becoming the lone guitarist accompanying The Scaffold, and then joining The Liverpool Scene, with McGough and fellow Liverpool poet Adrian Henri. He has also played with Roy Harper, Chris Spedding, Hank Wangford, Kevin Ayers, Vivian Stanshall and Grimms, and has played on many sessions for artists such as Richard Thompson, Cat Stevens, Paul Korda and Maddy Prior. He was a backing guitarist in the \\"surrogate band\\"Pete Woods on bass, Willy Wilson on drums, Andy Bown playing keyboards, Andy Roberts on guitar during Pink Floyd's The Wall tour in 1981 (replacing Snowy White) and can be heard on the live Pink Floyd album Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980‚Äì81. He has also written film scores, themes for TV series, backed Billy Connolly, provided music and voice for Spitting Image and continues to create musical backdrops for the poetry of Roger McGough. The Scaffold and The Liverpool Scene When he was eighteen, Roberts and a friend were playing at a late night review at the 1964 Edinburgh Festival. During his time there he not only met Vivian Stanshall of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, with whom he would later play in the band Grimms, but also the Liverpool comedy trio The Scaffold, whose members included poet Roger McGough, John Gorman and Paul McCartney's brother, Mike McGear. At the same time he also met Liverpool poet Adrian Henri, with whom he would subsequently work sporadically, and with whom he would make his first album in 1967. After he got back to London he accepted a place at Liverpool University to read Law and on the day he got there in 1965 bumped into Roger McGough in a bookshop. McGough later suggested some poetry and music collaborative gigs, so with Roberts providing backing guitar to the poetry of McGough and Henri, they appeared together for the first time in February 1966 at The Bluecoat Theatre in Liverpool. Things took off from there and within a couple of months, Roberts was doing poetry events at The Cavern and playing with a band at the University. On the back of a 1967 poetry anthology entitled ‚ÄòThe Liverpool Scene‚Äô, Henri, McGough and Roberts, along with jazz saxophonist Mike Evans and songwriter/guitarist Mike Hart, were taking bookings as ‚ÄòThe Liverpool Scene Poets‚Äô. Roberts was also recording with McGough's music/comedy outfit The Scaffold, on a series of singles which included their breakthrough hits ‚ÄòThank U Very Much‚Äô and ‚ÄòLily The Pink‚Äô. With The Scaffold's success McGough dropped out of the poetry gigs, leaving Roberts to suggest to Henri that all they needed was a bassist and drummer to become a bona fide band. Percy Jones and Bryan Dodson (later replaced by Pete Clarke) filled those roles respectively and The Liverpool Scene was born. Roberts graduated from University in 1968 and immediately turned professional and went on the road with The Liverpool Scene. The band made four albums between 1968 and 1970 and toured the UK extensively, including Led Zeppelin's first tour in 1969 along with Blodwyn Pig, and playing to some 150,000 people at the July 1969 Isle of Wight Festival on the same day as Bob Dylan & the Band. They also toured the United States later in 1969, on one gig in Detroit sharing the bill with Joe Cocker & The Grease Band, The Kinks, Grand Funk Railroad and The James Gang. The band broke up in May 1970. Plainsong Roberts formed the folk-rock band Plainsong in early 1972 with former Fairport Convention and Matthews Southern Comfort singer, Iain Matthews, on whose first solo album he had played guitar, and with whom he had earlier toured the United States alongside Richard Thompson in autumn 1971. The other two members of the band were Dave Richards (died January 2019), who played bass and piano and had been a member of both Sandy Denny's band and Roberts' Everyone band, and Bob Ronga (died November 2012), an American bass player who had earlier been the tour manager for Matthews, Roberts and Thompson on that 1971 tour. The band's name was picked on a whim when they randomly opened a copy of 'The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music' to find Plainsong at pages 450‚Äì451.Thro' My Eyes: A Memoir, Iain Matthews' biography co-written with Ian Clayton, Route Publishing, 2018, p. 114 After a month of rehearsals, Plainsong hit the road in February, touring both the UK and Holland. They also signed to Elektra Records and recorded their first album, In Search of Amelia Earhart, which was released in October 1972. The album mixed songs by both Matthews and Roberts with several covers, including versions of \\"Red River Dave\\" McEnery's song \\"Amelia Earhart's Last Flight\\", Paul Siebel's \\"Louise\\" and Jerry Yester and Judy Henske's \\"Raider\\". The album also included \\"True Story Of Amelia Earhart's Last Flight\\", a Matthews song based on research that suggests that Amelia Earhart on her round-the-world flight in 1937 may have been spying on Japanese bases in the Pacific islands; and \\"Even the Guiding Light\\", a response to Richard Thompson's \\"Meet on the Ledge\\". Now viewed with classic album status, 'In Search Of Amelia Earhart' was critically well-received at the time, but was not particularly a commercial success. The group recorded several radio sessions for the BBC and toured extensively with drummer Roger Swallow added to the line-up. Ronga, however, left the band due to a drinking problem and thus they began recording a second album, Now We Are 3, as a trio. Disagreements on the direction the album should take between Matthews and Richards occurred and in the event its release never came to fruition, leading to the break-up of the band. Roberts and Matthews each then began recording again as solo artists. Apart from in Japan, 'In Search Of Amelia Earhart' was unavailable on CD until its reissue in 2001. Several albums of archive recordings of Plainsong have also been released on CD since the 1990s, including And That's That ‚Äì The Demos, comprising recordings made for the band's unreleased second album, and two versions of On Air containing BBC recordings from 1972. In 1991, some eighteen years after the original band broke up, Roberts encountered Matthews again when he was performing in a pub in Brighton, and the two decided to revive Plainsong. Adding Mark Griffiths and Julian Dawson, they recorded three albums ‚Äì Dark Side of the Room (1992), Voices Electric (1994), and Sister Flute (1996) ‚Äì before Dawson left to pursue a solo career. His replacement was Clive Gregson, once of Any Trouble and later Gregson & Collister. The new line-up then recorded New Place Now in 1999, before Matthews and Roberts recorded a 6-track mini-album in 2001, A To B, as a duo under the Plainsong name. For the next Plainsong album, Pangolins in 2003, Dawson rejoined the band replacing Gregson. In its various line-ups, Plainsong performed and toured throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Their final album as a quartet, Fat Lady Singing, recorded live in the studio, was released in 2012, that year marking the 40th anniversary of the formation of the band. Plainsong undertook a 40th Anniversary Farewell tour of Germany, Holland and the UK before disbanding. Their performance at Norderstedt in Germany on 4 September 2012 was recorded live and broadcast on NDR Radio. The tour culminated with two dates in Japan in October 2012. In 2014 Roberts and Matthews decided to record some of the songs of Richard Fari√±a, to mark the approaching 50th anniversary of his death. With Griffiths back on board as well, the decision to use the Plainsong name made sense, and the group was again re-activated. The album Reinventing Richard: The Songs Of Richard Fari√±a was released in 2015. In July 2016 the trio played a handful of UK shows beginning at Whitstable in Kent, with US and European dates following later in September and October. The same Plainsong line-up came back together again for the Cropredy Festival in August 2017, celebrating Fairport Convention's 50th anniversary. The reformed band played a 12-song set featuring mostly songs from the 'Reinventing Richard' and 'Amelia Earhart' albums.

Jewellery In West Africa, the Asante are popular for their crafts and trade in gold. For the people of Ghana, not only does the colour gold represent wealth and status but there is also belief that it is a protection to whomever wears it. Necklaces have been made of gold bells, disks, and cross-shaped beads for those to wear around the neck. In the Alkan culture, each of these elements are made by getting shaped in wax then covering it with a heat resistance mould to form around the wax. After this process, the mould is heated meanwhile the wax melts in order for the melted gold to take its place. The gold is left to be cooled so that the mould can be taken apart to reveal its shine of gold. It is stated that the most important part of this necklace is a solid gold piece of jewellery that hangs from the neck; with this particular necklace, there is a pendent in the form of a small freshwater crab that is made from mould that‚Äôs found from a live crab. The crab symbolized the queen mother, meaning this is a way of knowing the royal status of its wearer (Richard B, 36). As mentioned, gold earrings were another form of Africa‚Äôs most magnificent jewels forms. ‚ÄúOne of the most striking forms of jewellery in West Africa are the distinctive, four-leaved earrings worn by Fulani women‚Äù states Peter. They add that Fulani woman would have their earrings made larger than their family‚Äôs wealth would increase to show her fortune and proven her safekeeping. (Richard B, 46). The meaning of each piece of jewellery is considered to be unique. Just by owning one of the pieces, one could depict hope, wisdom, or well-being of its owner (About African Art). Weapons Mini knives were used by the people of Zimbabwe, known as the Shona from souther Africa, to show respect for their ancestors. Most mini weapons were recently found as examples of honoring those who died in Guerrilla warfare (Peter, 44). In another resource that'll be given below, offered some more information on weapons that was not displayed in any of the books. This website includes many styles of African Folk Art, including a few that are not discussed in the original article. On here, it is stated that most weapons were made of copper and brass but mainly iron. As you can imagine, most of the weapons included swords, daggers, knives, spears, axes, and other sorts of things; the weapons collected from the end of the nineteenth century and beginnings of the twentieth century could depict the ornaments collected on these weapons, probably to suggest wealth status. The weapons would be blessed at ceremonies then said to have magical powers to protect the warriors at battle. Interestingly enough though, not only were these weapons used for defence or to attack, but many were made of simpler tools by skilled blacksmiths (About African Art). = Sculptures = Sculptures are important to African folk art because it represents many things such as royalty. These sculptures represent when people are having a difficult time with their religion. The ‚Äúheaddresses called ‚Äúfarming animal hat,‚Äù represented the mythical antelope, who taught man agriculture‚Äù (Davis 1981; 20). There are two different types of headdresses for men and women, for male ‚Äúhas a stylized open-work mane, and for female ‚Äúhas no mane, is depicted with an offspring on her back‚Äù (Davis 1981; 20). These headdresses are used for dances and to perform religious rituals. The materials that were used to make sculptures where pigment, wood, glass, wire, encrusted matter, nails, brass, metal, grasses, iron, fibre, and sacrificial materials. = Animal Art = Animal art is ‚Äútraditions, ancient and modern‚Äù by creating what humans see in them and nature. Animal art is made from adults, they built a relationship in understanding both animals and humans. Women have a part in this, for them, are the use of fabric to create patterns from the animals. Animals were seen as an honour, power, and they were a symbol to them. Some common animals they use are crocodiles, elephants, and hornbills. But ‚Äúwhile African artists portray some familiar animals (e.g., dogs, horses, rams), they tend to concentrate on curious menagerie of aardvarks and antelopes, bats and buffalo, pangolins, snakes, spiders, spotted cat, and a few others deemed meaningful and behaviour (Roberts 1995; 17). The animals they used to create their type of animal art are not just the common animals we know from film. The reason they create art with these types of animals is because of the details, and the ‚Äúnatural symbols‚Äù. They represent ‚Äúleadership, healing, divination, problem- solving, rites of passage, and rituals‚Äù (Roberts 1995; 16). They create this artwork on walls, craving on drums, masks, and pots. In creating this type of artwork shows them where they come from and how nature is important to them. Pottery During the 10th millennium BP, pottery was developed throughout the southern Sahara and the Sahel. Along with basketry vessels, pottery was essential for storing and transporting goods. Zambian pottery is particularly known for its geometric patterns.African folk art illustrates the traditions, political systems and spirituality of tribal villages, All-About-African- Art.com. Baskets In the Zulu culture, specifically in the early 1800s, a chief named Shaka established the Zulu state by uniting smaller cultures of Southern Africa. In the early nineteenth century, growing tobacco had already been popular among them because of importation from the Americas in the 1600s. At this time, the crop was to be inserted in the nose and that was the most popular way of using it; this offering to ancestors was a way to appreciate them and show them good manners and respect. For this, culture in particular, containers were made to hold the crop. They were made of small gourds decorated with patterns of wire and belonged mostly to the Zulu men. Furthermore, these containers were passed down from generation to generation to obtain a rich shine of applications of oil. It is stated that, ‚ÄúPeople of the Zulu culture admire elegant design and fine craftsmanship in everyday object serving dishes, tools and utensils, smoking pipes, and accessory boxes‚Äù (Richard B, 50). On the other hand, most traditional African baskets were made of materials like grass and leaves that would be considered textile weaving. They used these baskets oftener than not; it was a way for women to carry food from the market, collect harvested crops, and collecting goods for sale. Textiles The Shoowa people, a small population on the northwestern fringe of the Bushoong kingdom, Congo, have created visually delightful and colourful ceremonial panels that combine tradition and innovation in a complex artistic fashion. Despite maintaining a different language and loose political ties, the Shoowa share many cultural practices with the peoples of the Bushoong kingdom. Ceremonial Panel ‚Äî 1885‚Äì1910 An early example of Shoowa textiles is the Ceremonial Panel.Ceremonial Panel , 1885‚Äì1910. This piece dates from 1885 to 1910, and is 17\\" √ó 59\\" (41.91 cm √ó 149.86 cm) in size. This ancient cloth is composed of two pieces joined across the centre; and bordered by pompoms, a technique reported for textiles on the Kongo coast in the seventeenth century. The basic weave is typical for Shoowa with close warps and weft of similar thickness and even distribution. The designs are shaped by two embroidery techniques: lines of stem stitching and cut-pile. To create the plush effect, an embroiderer twists a strand of raffia into an iron needle which she inserts between the warp and weft, leaving a short tuft. After pulling the fibre strand through to about two millimetres in height, she cuts it with a narrow knife held vertically in the same hand and brushes both ends. Ceremonial Panel ‚Äî 1910‚Äì1930 A second example of the Ceremonial PanelCeremonial Panel , 1910‚Äì1930. from the Shoowa people, made of woven raffia palm fibre, cut pile and linear embroidery, dating from 1910‚Äì1930, is 23\\" √ó 24\\" (58.2 √ó 59.69 cm) in size. This piece is a classic model of quality for a mid-century Shoowa cloth. It retains the major features of the late 19th century style and fine workmanship. Unlike the Bushoong, the Shoowa typically, as here, dye the foundation cloth red before embroidery and execute their designs in natural beige and dark brown. The pattern of two wide columns of interlacing is a long-standing favourite Shoowa theme. The manner in which the broad columnar outlines are formed by multiple dark and light rows of stem stitching, interspersed with tiny light and dark plush motifs, called tunjoko, is another characteristic of Shoowa style. Because of the subtle distribution of light and dark across the surface, there is a convincing sense of balance despite the asymmetry. Ceremonial Panel ‚Äî 1950‚Äì1975 A third example of the Ceremonial PanelCeremonial Panel , 1950‚Äì1975. from the Shoowa people, also made of woven raffia palm fiber, cut-pile and linear embroidery, dating from 1950 to 1975, is 24\\" √ó 24 1/4\\" (60.96 cm. √ó 6l.28 cm.) in size. The colourful dots (diamonds, rectangles, triangles) belong to the familiar tiny tunjoko designs seen in many Shoowa cloths. However, here, instead of filling in the intervals between major motifs, they become the principal designs that fill the entire cloth. Intruding upon this dot-filled ground we see a grid of squares drawn by multiple, fine, dark-and-light embroidered lines. In front of this grid two large vertical interlace designs begin at the bottom as thin curved forms and rise criss-crossing to the top.

The FCC sought to prevent the Big Three television networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by preventing them from owning any of the programming that they aired in prime time. The rules also prohibited networks from airing syndicated programming they had a financial stake in. The rules changed the power relationships between networks and television producers, who often had to agree to exorbitant profit participation in order to have their shows aired. Some argue the rules brought about a golden era of independent television production by companies such as MTM Enterprises (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Norman Lear's Tandem Productions (All in the Family). Others argue the rules made the work of independent television production companies much more difficult because smaller companies could never afford the deficit financing required unless they received network assistance. (dead link) The rules also led to the destruction of numerous older television tapes in the 1970s; what could not be sold or given away to an independent syndicator was thrown out or recycled to recover silver content. Controversial from the very beginning, the fin-syn rule was relaxed slightly during the 1980s. Following the severe changes in the television landscape, such as the rise of the Fox network and cable television, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules were abolished completely in 1993. It was the repeal of fin-syn that ultimately made newer broadcast networks such as UPN and The WB financially interesting for their highly vertically integrated parent media conglomerates Paramount Pictures (Viacom) and Time Warner, respectively. On average, the number of shows that have been broadcast during prime time by the three main networks (CBS, NBC and ABC) per season has ranged between 63 and 75 shows between the 1987-88 and 2001-02 seasons. In the 1987-88 season, out of a total of 66 primetime shows that were broadcast, there were no such shows in which the network was either a producer or a co-producer. This number rose steadily to the point that during the 1992-93 season, there were about six shows out of a total of 67 shows produced or co-produced by the network; however as a result of the repeal of the fin-syn rules, this figure jumped to 11 the following year, whilst the total number of shows was barely 73. For the 2001-02 season, this figure rose to 20 shows that were network produced ‚Äì a change from 0%, to 9%, to 15% and from there to 20% ‚Äì over two decades. Today, each of the five major networks has an affiliated syndication company: * ABC ‚Äì Disney Media Distribution/Disney-ABC Domestic Television * CBS ‚Äì CBS Television Distribution/Paramount Worldwide Television Licensing & Distribution * NBC ‚Äì NBCUniversal Television Distribution * The CW ‚Äì Warner Bros. Television Distribution/CBS Television Distribution * Fox ‚Äì Fox First Run Closely related to fin-syn, the Prime Time Access Rule sought to strengthen local and independent producers by preventing affiliates from airing network programming during much of the early evening hours. This rule was eliminated on August 30, 1996. However, the period remains largely unclaimed by the networks due to the success of syndicated programs such as Entertainment Tonight and Wheel of Fortune. Deficit financing Before the fin-syn rules, the networks attained greater control and less risk by forcing production companies to deficit finance their programs while also demanding a percentage of the syndication revenues. Deficit financing is an arrangement in which the network pays the studio that makes a show a license fee in exchange for the right to air the program. The license fee is in exchange for the right to air an episode a few times (as a first-run and rerun episode), and does not cover the complete cost of production. The studio remains in ownership of the show. Before the fin-syn rules were established, networks would put into practice \\"profit participation.\\" With this, they gained greater control and avoided the risks by forcing the production companies to deficit finance their programs. Such practice led multiple production companies into financial hardships. Independent producers and those not signed with major working studios were hit the hardest because most of the profit revenue went to the networks. Author Amanda D. Lotz explains in her book The Television Will Be Revolutionized that, by the mid-1960s, the networks gained as much as 91% of the programming revenue from profit participation. It was at that point that the government stepped in and got involved with the fin-syn rules in the 1970s. Deficit financing minimized the substantial risks and costs of developing programs for the networks while initially affording the studios considerable benefits as well. In successful cases, the studio receives a large return on its investment when it re-sells the show in a combination of syndication windows because the sales provide nearly pure profit: no additional work typically goes into the program and the network receives none of the payment. However, if the show is cancelled by the network before producing enough episodes to be syndicated, or if no syndication buyers want the show, the production company must absorb the difference between the cost of production and the original license fee, which can now amount to millions of dollars for each season. , most reality television producers believe that deficit financing will never be financially viable because the vast majority of reality production companies are too small to wait long enough for the big payoff (and, because most reality shows are relatively poor performers in reruns, such a payoff is less likely to materialize anyway). Instead of syndication, producers have been covering gaps between license fees and rising production costs by selling shows' formats to foreign territories and developing integrated marketing deals with advertisers. Rule changes The fin-syn rules created two well- defined periods that might be considered characteristics of the multi-channel transition. First; rise of independent studios that provided a competitive environment. Second; The Walt Disney Company, Viacom, News Corporation and Time Warner made purchases that combined studios and networks to create new kinds of corporate entities. Throughout the 1970s into the mid-1990s, the fin- syn rules broke a few network-era norms that created programming well before the adjustments to the multi-channel transition. This also led to the creation of a fluid competitive environment between network and studios, however this did not last long. In 1983, the FCC had received demands from the networks to end the fin-syn rules. In 1991, these had officially materialized, and the agency's commissioners voted to eliminate the rules in 1993. After the rules were eliminated, networks began populating their schedules with new shows purchased from studios owned by the network. Throughout all this, the audience began to have more choices and control over entertainment options, and networks were pressured to offer fewer reruns to keep viewers' attention, leading networks to create programming.

While they were formerly notorious as pollutant spewing technical monsters in the eyes of citizens' groups, nowadays, thermal waste treatment facilities are considered to be the essential pillars of sustainable, forward-looking recycling and raw material sectors. One benefit of thermal waste treatment facilities is to avoid the yield of methane gas that is a by-product of decay that damages the climate strongly. Another is the production of energy during incineration which helps protection of the environment. Valuable resources will also be conserved by means of separation and exploitation of the recyclables in the waste before incineration. Trigger of development Since 2005, in the European Union, waste can be disposed of, only if it was subject to a treatment before, so that the substances contained in it will become inert, thus to a large extent no more harmful reactions with the environment will occur in the landfill body. The incineration process takes a key role in the waste management by fulfilling this requirement of the Waste Storage Regulation and the Landfill Regulation. Main purpose The main purpose of incineration is to reduce the waste volume and destruction of potentially dangerous substances. The incineration of waste is classified as an act of exploitation in the Waste Framework Directive adopted in May 2008. The waste that can be used for energy production is subject to the free trade policy and may be moved in the EU trans-boundary. The waste that is to be eliminated entirely, for example hazardous and toxic waste, must be disposed in the vicinity of their origin. Since the volume of waste is growing continuously, landfilling does not seem to be a long-term solution for waste disposal. To eliminate this volume, currently, only two approaches remain: The first approach is waste incineration and the second one, which is probably the best solution, is waste avoidance in addition to re-utilization by means of recycling. That means, the reintroduction of valuable materials into the production cycle. This is possible only if economically feasible and environmentally acceptable methods are available. Forecast of future developments The interest of new design of incinerators and incineration process focus on further improvements in energy efficiency and the further savings of CO2. Engineers are working on several aspects of it, from the optimization of the fuel consumption of the plants, to increasing the efficiency of the equipment. Similarly, they work for better techniques for utilization of rest materials and utilization of slag and flying ash. Today more than 80 percent of slag and flying ash are already being used, mainly in earth filling or in road construction Role in the cycle of waste management Mobile incinerators provide a useful addition to the available standards in waste management. The elimination of hazardous and toxic waste on site is one of the major uses of mobile incinerators. A mobile incinerator unit is the most suitable product for countries that are starting to tackle waste management, because in such cases, there are no previous statistics about the amount of waste and its composition. Therefore all initial data is based on assumptions only. Until more accurate data can be collected, mobile incinerator units help make the transition, with their mobility and flexibility. Description A mobile incinerator is an incineration system mounted on a semi-trailer. Modern incinerators enable complete and sterile incineration of waste. They can be operated virtually anywhere. A modern mobile incinerator unit (MIU) is capable of incinerating waste at a temperature of up to . This means, it is designed to incinerate all kinds of waste as well as infected hazardous waste. This satisfies the requirement that, waste of hospitals and health facilities must be burnt at a minimum temperature of acc. to the rules of environmental protection. It can also be used to dispose of household waste, as a measure of environment protection. Applications * domestic waste, * industrial waste, * medical waste, * hazardous waste, * cadaver or carrion of animals and * solid and paste-like chemical residues with moisture content. Arguments for mobile incineration An important argument for the mobile incineration is, due to its mobility, it can go to the place of origin of the waste. This behavior makes it unique, and allows it to be used for waste of several cities and/or hospitals at the same time. Fighting against epidemics is a serious issue for authorities responsible for the health of their citizens in every country. In case of an epidemic it is required to dispose the infected hazardous waste of the diseased, hospitals and health facilities as soon as possible. Latest burner and control technology, together with a flue gas cleaning system is the basis of a modern mobile incinerator unit that meets the highest environmental standards. (See section Emissions) Process description =Fuel= Natural gas, diesel or biodiesel (so called green fuel) is usable as fuel for the mobile incinerators. =Furnace= The furnace of a modern mobile incinerator plant consists of a main combustion chamber (primary chamber) and a post combustion chamber (secondary chamber). Charging is carried out mostly from the front of the main combustion chamber through a feed opening system, which is closed by a gate valve. A check valve behind the feed opening prevents direct contact with the combustion chamber. Feeding is automatically controlled by a furnace control system. An automated burner serves for the heating of the combustion chamber subject to the calorific value of the waste charged. The feed opening is released as soon as the necessary flue gas temperature is reached. Two types of design are normally in use; a) an incinerator without grate and b) a rotary-kiln (pyrolysis). In the post combustion chamber the gas is heated to minimum of in order to ensure an environmentally friendly emission based on the European Union Directive (85/337/EEC) on Environmental Impact Assessments (known as the EIA Directive). The normal combustion temperature is minimum and up to , depending on the process settings. At the end of the thermal process, ash extraction is done through an ash door. =Flue gas cleaning system= Not all available devices in the market have a flue gas treatment plant. But there are devices available with a dry flue gas cleaning system according to the rigorous European standards. Such a flue gas system mainly consists of a dry sorption system for SO2, HCI, HF, dust reduction, heavy metals, dioxins, etc. To protect the whole system, an automatic emergency water injection facility at the combustion chamber serves for the cooling of flue gas in case, too much waste or waste with too high calorific value is charged. Mobile incinerator units with such a system are environmental friendly. Many units are now offered with a Venturi Scrubber as the preferred treatment module. =Fuel and water tank= A bonded fuel and a water tank are mostly installed on or under the semi-trailer. =Fan and stack= Mostly a fan transports the flue gas to the stack. =Electrical, instrumentation and control equipment and its standards= The electrical, instrumentation and control equipment of such a modern incinerator unit includes a main switch, an emergency switch as well as all necessary safety catches, contactors, relays and clamps, key switches for the start up and so on. All measuring, controlling and adjusting functions are realized in a modern mobile incineration plant. There are some safety limits which are processed by the hardware of such a plant. For start-up and operation of the mobile units, most have their own electrical generator on board for power supply. The whole equipment has to comply with European (e.g. DIN 41494, DIN 41488) and/or international (e.g. IEC Publication 297) standards. Emissions of modern example with a flue gas cleaning system Under normal operation conditions, mobile incinerators are consistently able to keep emissions well below respective limits, for example in accordance to the German TA-Luft regulation. Often, emissions are well below the limits. This applies especially to the polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans (dioxins and furans). In spite of sophisticated technology, it may happen that higher emission values are reached due to inhomogeneous fuel (waste composition), especially in the phases of start up, shut down and malfunction of a plant. =Legally permitted emission levels= The legally permitted emission levels usually are far above the actual emissions of pollutants if the emissions over a period of one year is considered. These isolated instances of exceeding the limits have no effect on public health since even these higher values are usually still within the limits permitted for other technical or chemical plants. =The impact of waste composition on emissions= Domestic waste has a calorific value of approx. from to approx . Industrial waste shows much higher fluctuation. This inhomogeneity pose a problem during the thermal treatment of waste. The exact composition of waste that is subject to fluctuation can not usually be estimated initially but it shows its potential energy as well as its pollutants during combustion. sorting the waste, recycling and composting has significant influence on the composition of waste which in turn affects its heating value. The large possible variation in calorific value and composition of the waste require a highly complex automatic control during the thermal treatment that must take into account both the reliability of the process and the requirements of environmental protection. Since the requirements of environmental protection and the reliability are contradictory to each other, there must be compromising solutions that are mutually acceptable for both sides. The parameters of O2 and CO concentration and fire room temperature are the main basic variables to be controlled when designing the process.

He is portrayed by Eric Millegan. The character was introduced as Dr. Temperance Brennan's brilliant young assistant at the beginning of the series before he received his doctorate in forensic anthropology in Season 2. Millegan was a series regular for Seasons 1 to 3, appearing in all episodes. Since then, he has made guest appearances in Season 4's \\"The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond\\" and \\"The End in the Beginning\\" (dream sequence), Season 5's \\"The Parts in the Sum of the Whole\\" (flashback) and returned in the Season 11 finale \\"The Nightmare within the Nightmare\\", and had a recurring role in the series' final season. In the series penultimate episode \\"The Day in the Life\\", Zack is exonerated for the murder that left him locked up since the third season finale, opening the way for him to return to society in just over a year's time.  Character history  The youngest in a large Michigan family with three brothers and four sisters, Zack was a child prodigy, a genius with an I.Q. well above 163 with a supposed eidetic memory. According to his character bio on the DVD for Season 1, Zack graduated from college at the age of 16. It is revealed in the episode \\"The Boy in the Time Capsule\\" that Zack was physically bullied throughout high school. In \\"A Boy in a Tree,\\" he is heard saying he \\"didn't have any friends\\" in high school and endured relentless physical and emotional abuse through his school life. Additionally, it is revealed that Zack is an excellent singer. At the beginning of the show, he had started two doctorates‚Äîone in Forensic Anthropology, the completion of which is shown on-screen in the episode \\"Judas on a Pole\\", and the other in Applied Engineering, the completion of which is referred to in \\"The Killer in the Concrete\\". His specialty, just like Dr. Brennan, is in the analysis of remains, especially identifying cause of death and weapons from marks on skeletal remains. It is usually his task to remove the flesh from the bones, a process known as maceration. Because of his tremendous intellect, he has a strong broad-based knowledge of many of the specialties in the Jeffersonian lab. Zack's best friend is Jack Hodgins. Although it at first appears Hodgins and Zack are roommates, it is later revealed he rents the apartment over Hodgins' garage. Zack also carpools with Hodgins because he can neither drive a car nor ride a bike. He once made a comment to Booth that, if Booth shared Zack's knowledge of Structural Engineering, he would be afraid to drive as well (Season 1 \\"The Man on Death Row\\"). In The Man in the Bear, Zack and Hodgins compete for the affections of a beautiful delivery lady until they realize in the end that she might be bisexual or homosexual, when she shows an attraction to forensic artist Angela Montenegro. Episodes towards the end of Season 1 reveal Zack's colleagues, especially Dr. Goodman, feel he has become too comfortable as Dr. Brennan's assistant and is therefore not completing any of his work towards his doctorate degrees to avoid having to move into a new position. Goodman and Hodgins conspire to make Zack less comfortable in his position to motivate him to complete his studies, thus encouraging him to fulfill his potential of more than just an assistant. Right before he was about to complete his doctorate, Zack asks the Jeffersonian's new forensics head, Dr. Camille Saroyan, if he can have a job working at the Jeffersonian. She replies she could not put him in front of a court to testify because people would not take him seriously. Zack then goes to ask Angela for fashion advice, and she gives him a complete makeover that includes a new haircut and a suit. After completing his doctorate and getting the makeover from Angela, Zack again asks Cam for a job; she gives it to him, saying, \\"Who am I to break up the team?\\" At the end of Season 2, Zack receives a request from the office of the President to ship out to Iraq. His reason for being there is kept confidential, and he only tells Hodgins and Booth about it. He is indecisive and asks Booth for advice as Booth \\"knows more about duty and honor than anyone else I know\\". Zack also turns down the offer to be the best man at Hodgins and Angela's wedding in case he is killed in Iraq, as he does not want Hodgins' memories of the wedding to be tainted with sadness. However, Zack is later seen at the wedding. It is revealed in Episode 1 of Season 3 that Zack had just returned from a three-month stint in Iraq, having returned early because he \\"failed to assimilate.\\" In \\"The Pain in the Heart\\", the final episode of Season 3, Zack receives third-degree burns and massive tissue damage on both hands after an explosion in the lab. It is later revealed he was working as the apprentice of the Gormogon, a cannibalistic serial killer, and the explosion was designed as a distraction so Gormogon could break into the lab and steal back the silver skeleton. Zack's weaker personality was easily manipulated by Gormogon so he believed his belief system irrefutable, even going as far as to divide the bones of a lobbyist among the 10,000 skeletons in the Jeffersonian's bone storage room, called Limbo. However, Zack still maintained a loyalty to his friends. As pointed out by Brennan, he was willing to injure himself to keep Hodgins safe. He gives up the location of Gormogon's house after Brennan makes him realize his logic is faulty. At the end of the episode, prosecutor Caroline Julian cuts Zack a deal. He pleaded guilty to killing the lobbyist and declared \\"Non compos mentis\\", thus committing him into a mental asylum rather than to prison. Zack is no longer a regular character on the show, but series creator Hart Hanson said he may become a recurring character to provide consults to the team with \\"certain talents we can use in a 'Hannibal Lecter' kind of way.\\"Mitovitch, Matt Webb. \\"Exclusive: Bones Boss Responds to Finale 'Zack-lash'\\", TV Guide, May 21, 2008. The episode \\"The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond\\" reveals Zack is receiving psychological treatment from FBI psychologist Dr. Lance Sweets. It is also shown at least Hodgins and Angela have both been in contact with Zack during his confinement. Hodgins is shown bringing him a mathematical riddle to solve. In a session with Sweets, Zack admits to feeling guilty for killing the lobbyist but claims he was not actually crazy, arguing he committed the crime for what had appeared to be perfectly logical reasons at the time. \\"I was wrong, not delusional,\\" he says. Sweets believes Zack should feel more guilty about killing the lobbyist and less about having been taken in by Gormogon's rhetoric. Towards the end of the episode, Zack escapes from the institution. It is revealed he could have escaped at any time but did not feel it was necessary to do so until that particular moment. After helping his co-workers solve the case, he willingly returns to the institution with Sweets. While returned to the asylum, Zack tells Sweets that, although he helped Gormogon find the lobbyist, he himself had not actually stabbed him. In other words, Zack believes he killed the lobbyist, but, from a legal standpoint, he is considered only an accessory or co-conspirator. Sweets insists Zack change his story, but Zack refuses. He fears, if his secret were to come out, he will find himself in prison, where he is sure to do very poorly. He reminds Sweets, as Zack's therapist, he must not reveal his secret because he would be violating doctor-patient confidentiality. The episode closes with Zack behind bars at the institution, and Sweets keeping his secret. In the Season 4 finale, Zack is considered a suspect when a man is murdered in a popular nightclub owned by Booth and Brennan. Zack is described by Vincent Nigel- Murray as \\"the type of moron who goes to jail for a murder he didn't commit\\", suggesting that, on some level, Booth knows Zack is innocent. At the end of the episode, it is shown that the entire thing was in fact a dream about an alternate time line that Booth had while unconscious and part of a new book Brennan was writing. Zack also returned in the 100th episode as a flashback to Booth and Brennan's first case together. Later on, Hodgins says that Zack will be in the asylum \\"forever\\", hinting that Zack would be in the asylum on a permanent basis and would never be released into the general public. Also, in the episode \\"The He in the She,\\" Hodgins tells Vincent that Zack would be locked up for the rest of his life. After eight years from being absent from the show, Zack is mentioned in season 11 \\"The Movie in the Making.\\" The episode was a \\"mockumentary\\" on The Jeffersonian and its partnership with the FBI. When the film crew begins asking Hodgins about Zack, Hodgins becomes visibly shaken. In \\"The Monster in the Closet,\\" a serial killer has been discovered and named The Puppeteer, due to the nature of the crimes and how the killer would hang the victims from wires and use them as puppets. The following episode, \\"The Nightmare Within the Nightmare\\", which is the season 11 finale, a desiccated body is discovered in an abandoned warehouse. The clothes that the victim is dressed in are the same clothes that Dr. Brennan had donated a few months earlier. A mixtape is left with the body and the songs on the tape are from a songbook printed in Michigan. Over the past few weeks, Dr. Brennan has been having vivid nightmares about a burned attacker; in one dream, Wendell brings Brennan her coffee, something Zack used to do. In the dream, Wendell's hands are severely burned. Dr. Brennan begins to break down and sees a therapist to help interpret her dreams. The therapist makes Brennan realize that the attacker is someone she knows but doesn't want to accept who it is. After coming back to the lab, Brennan calls the team because everyone had left. The team, waiting for her at a nearby pub, tells her they left because of an email that was supposedly sent out by Dr. Brennan. It is soon revealed that the email was sent by The Puppeteer. While on the phone with the team, The Puppeteer comes into the room and disconnects Brennan's call. Booth takes the therapist's notes from Brennan's sessions to piece together the puzzle. Back at the lab, the team goes over all the clues about The Puppeteer. They realize that the dreams about Wendell is a symbol for someone who used to work at the lab. The team becomes silent as they realize who it is; Cam states, \\"Oh no, it can't be.\\" Booth then races to the hospital where Zack is staying and discovers that Zack has escaped. Later on, as Brennan wakes up, she asks, \\"Zack?\\" Zack says, \\"Dr. Brennan, it is good to see you again. You and I, we have so much to talk about.\\" The Season 12 premiere of Bones solves the mystery about Zack. He has taken Brennan to the old vault of the Gormogon, which is in the basement of the Jeffersonian, with the intention of protecting her from The Puppeteer and to reveal the truth about himself. Booth captures Zack and he is taken into custody. It is revealed that after the death of Lance Sweets, Zack harmed himself, leaving a large scar on his forehead and occasional blackouts from minor brain damage. After being allowed to consult the evidence files of the Puppeteer case with Brennan, he concludes that, while blacked out, he committed the crimes, and wishes to return to the mental institution that is his home. In a surprise turn of events, the team at the Jeffersonian find out that it is Zack's doctor from the institution, Dr. Mihir Roshan, that has been committing the murders and arranging the skeleton marionettes. Dr. Roshan intended to poison Zack, and Booth arrives at the institution in time to save him. While Zack was able to overpower Roshan, he was unable to find the strength of will to kill him. Booth shoots Roshan, and Zack survives. He concludes he could not have committed murder under the order of Gormogon, and confesses his innocence to Brennan and Booth. This convinces them to re-examine the evidence, and the episode ends with the idea that Zack may become free of the institution in the future. In \\"The Flaw in the Saw\\", Hodgins works to find evidence to exonerate Zack. Although he finds evidence, Cam fears that Hodgins is planting it to free Zack and refuses to consider it. However, Cam eventually decides to go through Hodgins' evidence. In \\"The Steal in the Wheels\\", the Jeffersonian team is able to locate the body of the Gormogon's former apprentice, the true killer, and match blood on it to the lobbyist Zack supposedly killed. In \\"The Day in the Life\\", Zack goes before a judge for his appeal. Based on this new evidence, Zack is exonerated of the murder charge but not of aiding a known killer. As a result, he will have to finish the remaining thirteen months on his sentence. While Brennan is sorry they couldn't get him released, Zack accepts this as thirteen months is nothing compared to the life sentence he was originally facing. Characterization Despite his intelligence, Zack is unsure of himself, though he has provided crucial insights to some of the team's cases. He is unable to forcefully express his opinion to Dr. Brennan, possibly due to romantic feelings toward her. When he discovered Temperance's own Forensic Anthropology professor had become her lover, Zack repeatedly wondered aloud whether he might enter into a similar relationship with Dr. Brennan. His colleagues quickly dismissed this idea as nonsense. Zack appears to have an on and off-again relationship with \\"Naomi in Paleontology\\". In the third season, they accompany each other to the annual Jeffersonian Institute Halloween party, and he mentions her again in \\"The Parts in the Sum of the Whole\\". Although well-meaning, helpful, and friendly, when a situation calls for social interaction or intuition, he is often lost. Zack has no problem making inappropriate comments about others' personal lives, and has asked Agent Booth for advice on sex and women. At one point, Booth threatened to shoot Zack \\"between the eyes\\" if he continued to ask him those questions. He also asked Angela for advice, on one occasion even recommending him to \\"reap the benefits of [her] sexual wisdom\\", and Hodgins gave him a pocket-sized Kama Sutra to help him out. Further evidence of his social ineptitude can be seen in the frequent, on-screen coaching in social matters he gets from Jack and Angela. He is very literal-minded, and is often confused by colloquial expressions or metaphor, despite his high intelligence. His attempts to use such expressions are met with mixed success, such as referring to a skull he'd cleaned as being \\"clean enough to eat off of\\". His inability to pick up on pop culture references or jokes was often a source of comedy in the show. Other characters, especially Booth and Hodgins, were often annoyed or turned off by his lack of social skills. Hodgins once called him a \\"dull Vulcan\\" in exasperation. In the episode \\"The Killer in the Concrete\\", Booth is on the phone with Zack and Dr. Brennan while looking for \\"Icepick\\" at a model airplane enthusiasts gathering. Unaware of Zack's interest in planes, Booth comments every \\"airplane freak\\" in the area was at the event, and Zack corrects him by saying the enthusiasts prefer to be called \\"pilots.\\" Zack mentions forensic anthropology is only one of his areas of study; he received a second doctorate in applied engineering, and he is extremely adept in practical aeronautics. Even in the asylum, Zack apparently still has some degree of contact with his old colleagues. Hodgins occasionally visits him with puzzles for him to solve and Sweets becomes his therapist. The season 11 finale implied that Booth also may have had some contact with Zack in the seasons following his departure, as he knows an orderly at the institution where he is located, and knows exactly where his room is.http://www.ew.com/recap/bones-season-11-finale References Category:Bones (TV series) characters Category:Fictional anthropologists Category:Fictional characters from Michigan Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Zack Addy"},{"id":"9901724","text":"Lansdowne Bridge in 1897 Entry to the Lansdowne Bridge Sukkur Lansdowne Bridge Rohri, Sindh The Lansdowne Bridge (Sindhi ŸÑŸäŸÜÿ≥⁄äÿßÿ¶ŸàŸÜ ŸæŸÑ; ) is a 19th-century bridge that spans the Indus River between the cities of Sukkur and Rohri, in the Sindh province of Pakistan. When completed in 1889, the bridge was the \\"longest rigid girder bridge in the world.\\" The Ayub Bridge was built immediately adjacent to the bridge in 1962, and so photographs of the Landsdown Bridge usually also show the Ayub Bridge. Design It was designed by Sir Alexander Meadows Rendel; he designed the Lansdowne Bridge Rohri at Sukkur over the Indus River, which when it was completed in 1889 was the largest cantilever bridge in the world. The girder work, weighing a massive 3,300 tons, was manufactured in London by the firm of Westwood, Baillie and erected by F.E. Robertson, and Hecquet. Upon completion, the bridge allowed for easier rail access between Punjab and Karachi. Background Indus was bridged at Attock in 1887 and that allowed Railways in India to run from the westernmost post of Khyber Pass to the eastern city of Calcutta. India's rail link to the port of Karachi was however, still broken at the Indus flowing between the towns of Rohri and Sukkur. Indus was not bridged between Kotri and Hyderabad either therefore trains ran on Karachi-Jamshoro-Larkana-Sukkur route as early as 1879 and then they were ferried across to Rohri and vice versa on a river ferry. At Sukkur the river Indus flows through a gap in a range of low limestone hills and gets divided into two channels (Sukkur and Rohri channels) by an island called Bukkur. The Bukkur Island thus provides the best spot for a river crossing. Bridging the channel between Bukkur and Rohri was not so easy. The river bed here is not rocky but silty which made it difficult to build a bridge pier. Therefore, bridge designs were put forward to build a bridge without a pillar. One such design was for an arched bridge but it was not considered in the 1870s. Later on in 1962, the river was bridged using a very similar design that came to be known as the Ayub arch. History The Indus Valley State Railway had reached Sukkur in 1879 and the steam ferry that transported eight wagons at a time across the Indus between Rohri and Sukkur was found to be cumbersome and time-consuming. The ferry link became redundant when Lord Reay, Governor of Bombay, deputizing for Lord Lansdowne the viceroy, inaugurated the Bridge on March 25, 1889. As summer comes early to Sukkur and the heavy European-style uniforms of the time would have been uncomfortable, the opening ceremony took place early in the morning. At the ceremony, Lord Reay unlocked a highly ornamental padlock (designed by J.L. Kipling, CIE, Principal of the Mayo School of Art in Lahore and father of Joseph Rudyard, the famous poet and author) which held shut the cumbersome iron gates guarding entry to the bridge. The gathered dignitaries then walked across the bridge and adjourned to breakfast followed by toasts under a shaman (Berridge 1967:128). The bridge provided the railway link between Lahore, in the heart of the granary of British India, and the port of Karachi on the Arabian Sea. When the great steel Ayub arch was constructed (1960‚Äì1962), railway traffic was shifted there. About a hundred feet apart, the two bridges seem like one from a distance. The Ayub arch became the world's third longest railway arch span and the first bridge in the world to have \\"the railway desk slung on coiled wire rope suspenders.\\" The consulting engineer was David B. Steinman of New York, proponent of 'vocational aesthetics'. It cost about two crore rupees and the foundation stone was laid on December 9, 1960. It was opened by President Muhammad Ayub Khan on May 6, 1962. Technical Briefs Between 1872 and 1882 bridge survey was conducted and different people suggested 5 different bridge proposals. None of them was considered completely feasible at that time. An engineer by the name of Sir Alexander Rendel was then called in and he proposed a design consisting of two anchored cantilevers, each 310 feet long, carrying a suspended span of 200 ft in the middle. This design was considered feasible and became known as the Lansdowne Bridge. The girder work of this bridge was given to Westwood, Baillie & Co. of London. The bridge was first put together in the contractor's yard. The 170 feet tall cantilevers of the bridge when assembled, made quite a conspicuous scene in London. By 1887 the steel work started to arrive at Sukkur and Rohri. The bridge construction was then started under the supervision of F.E. Robertson and Hecquet. Their names are written to date on a plaque on each cantilever of the bridge. The construction of Lansdowne Bridge was no joke. It is said that bridge designer did not think much about how the bridge would be built in real life. Giant derricks, each weighing 240 tons and each being 230 feet in length had to be erected leaning out over the water and at the same time they had to incline inwards in the plane at right-angles to the line of the bridge. And as if that was not difficult enough, horizontal tie girders 123 feet long and weighing 86 tons each had to be assembled at a height of 180 feet. This indeed was a challenge in the 1880s. When both cantilevers were completed, work started on the center span. The bridge designer had intended that 200 ft long span would be assembled on boats and then hoisted up. This plan did not work in practical as Indus remained quite violent 6 months of the year owing to floods. In the end Robertson built another temporary bridge to provide a platform on which the suspended span could be put together. The temporary staging weighed 56 tons. The permanent girder work of the 200 ft span was erected and riveted in four and a half days. This is a good going even by today's standards. In 1880s Robertson's men did not have pneumatic tools or electric drives. The Human and Monetary Cost The construction of Lansdowne bridge claimed 6 lives. Four men fell from the dizzy heights and 2 were killed by tools falling on them. The cost of bridge was Rs 2,696,000 including Rs 276,000 that were spent on foundations only.

Description Their shells were broad and rounded, giving them an almost spherical appearance. Unlike many other ammonites, the shells of Arcestes lack keels that would otherwise stabilize them while swimming. Because of this, some paleontologists have suggested that they were bottom- dwelling crawlers. The shell of Arcestes is globular or subglobular with periodic narrow transverse constrictions in internal molds due to periodic internal transverse ridges (varices) in the shell. The suture is ammonitic with complexly subdivided elements. The ventral lobe is subdivided by a low median saddle. Lateral lobes and saddles have generally triangular outlines but are deeply embayed by strong projections forming tree-like patterns. They form a series diminishing in size and complexity in a rather straight line going from the venter to the umbilicus in the middle of the shell. Distribution Fossils of Arcestes are found in Mid to Upper Triassic marine strata throughout the world, including California (A. pacificus), Nevada (A (Anisarcestes) mrazici) and Austria (A. intuslabiatus and A. binacostomus).

Early life  Mary Josephine Coughlin was born in Brooklyn, New York to Bridget Gorman and Michael (Mike) Coughlin on April 11, 1897. Her parents immigrated to the U.S. from Ireland separately in the 1890s. Michael was a laborer, Bridget did housework. They met in New York and were married. They had six children, Anna, Mary, Dennis, Catherine, Agnes, and Walter. Mae was born April 11, 1897, the second oldest and grew up in Brooklyn, New York at the edge of an Italian neighborhood. She grew up to be tall, blond, and slender, and attended school until she started working as a sales clerk. She went by the name of Mae for most of her life.  Family Life  = Marriage and Family = Mae Coughlin married Alphonse Capone on December 30, 1918 at the St. Mary Star of the Sea Church in Brooklyn, New York. They either met at a party in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, or their marriage was arranged by Al‚Äôs mother who knew Mae from church. Mae was two years older than her husband. On their marriage certificate, Al increased his age by one year, and Mae decreased her age by two years, making them both appear 20 years old. Despite the rivalry between Italian-American and Irish-American groups at the time, there is no evidence that Capone‚Äôs parents opposed their marriage. It‚Äôs speculated that Al‚Äôs parents were probably in favor of the union, because for an Italian boy, an Irish wife was seen as a status symbol. In addition to their differences in ethnicity, Mae was also more educated, more Catholic, and more middle class while her husband was less educated, and grew up in a rougher part of town. Mae Capone remained a devoted Catholic throughout her entire life. Three weeks before their wedding, Mae reportedly gave birth to a son, Albert Francis ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù Capone. The couple had no more children. As reported by Deirdre Capone, a great niece of Al Capone (the granddaughter of Ralph Capone), this was because Capone was sterile due to a birth defect. Other sources claim that she contracted syphilis from Al which caused each subsequent try for another child to end in miscarriage or stillbirth. While most Al Capone biographies say that Mae Capone was Sonny‚Äôs biological mother, according to Deirdre Capone, Mae Capone was not Sonny‚Äôs biological mother. Sonny‚Äôs real mother had passed away in childbirth and Al‚Äôs mother, Teresa, had arranged for Mae‚Äôs and Al‚Äôs wedding so that Sonny would have a mother growing up. From a young age, Sonny showed signs of being hard of hearing. This supposedly was because Mae had transmitted syphilis to him as well. When Sonny developed a mastoid ear infection, Al and Mae Capone traveled from Chicago, Illinois to New York to ensure he got the best care. She also filed a lawsuit when her grandchildren were being bullied in school for being a Capone, following the release of the TV series, The Untouchables.  Involvement in Al's gang life  Al Capone's cellCapone was not involved in Al‚Äôs racketeering business. Although she was affected by the actions Al took in dating other women while they were married. She once told her son, ‚Äúnot to do what your father did. He broke my heart.\\" Her hair also started to gray when she was 28, presumably due to stress regarding her husband‚Äôs situation. Al was ultimately sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment on October 24, 1931, and Mae was one of three people allowed to visit him in prison. The other two were Al‚Äôs mother and son. Mae remained a devoted wife, frequently sending letters to her husband, referring to him as ‚Äòhoney,‚Äô and expressing her longing for him to return home. She visited him in person as well, traveling up to 3,000 miles from the Capone's Florida home to Alcatraz, usually going to lengths to obscure her face in order to avoid the paparazzi. From Al's imprisonment up until his death, Mae, along with Al's brothers and sisters, were in charge of his affairs: possessions, titles, and belongings. Al was finally released from prison and arrived at the Capones' Florida home March 22, 1940. Mae was Al's primary caretaker following his release from prison. He died January 25, 1947 in their Miami, Florida home. He was buried in a Catholic cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. Mae was distraught following his death, and remained out of public spotlight thereafter.  Financial Well-Being  The Chicago, Illinois Capone home Al's racketeering business provided well for the family. Somewhere in the years between 1920-1921 he bought a home in Chicago, IL that housed Mae, Sonny as well members of the Capone family. Mae and Sonny did not make the move from Brooklyn, New York to Chicago to join Al until 1923. He also bought a second home for his family in Palm Isle, Florida. Mae had the liberty to decorate the home lavishly. The family owned several cars: a couple of Lincolns and a custom designed cabriolet (similar to a Cadillac) that Mae herself drove. They lived comfortably, and had enough money to pay off bill collectors when their bills were overdue. They were once even burglarized at their Palm Island home. It was reported that an estimated $300,000 worth of Mae‚Äôs jewelry was stolen.  Legal Issues  = Lawsuits = In 1936 the federal government filed a tax lien of $51,498.08 on the Capone's Miami, Florida estate. Having purchased the estate under Mae's name, and Al being in jail, Mae was left to deal with the lien. She paid it. In 1937, she filed a lawsuit against J. Edwin Larsen, the collector for the Internal Revenue Service, on claims that the tax lien money had been collected illegally. Her request for a refund of $52,103.30 was denied. The cast of The Untouchables In 1959, Desilu Productions released a two part series called The Untouchables. The series was about prohibition agents fighting crime. In 1960, Capone, her son, and Al's sister, Mafalda Maritote, sued Desilu Productions, Inc., Columbia Broadcasting System and Westinghouse Electric Corp., for $6 million in damages. They claimed the series infringed on their privacy and had caused them humiliation and shame. Sonny Capone claimed that his children had been made fun of in school, so much that he was forced to pick up and move his family to another city. The federal District Court and Chicago Circuit Court rejected the suit. When the plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, their appeal was rejected as well on the basis that privacy rights are personal and do not extend to next of kin.  Death  Capone died April 16, 1986 in a nursing home in Hollywood, Florida. She was buried in Florida.  Political background and context  = Mae Capone and the prohibition = During Prohibition there was controversy among women concerning the 18th amendment. Organizations such as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) supported the 18th amendment and fought to uphold it. This organization was viewed as being representative of all women and many assumed that women would stand united on this subject. However, this notion fell apart with the rise of The Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR). Both groups were centered around the protection of the home but had radically different opinions on how that could be accomplished. While the WCTU believed that the home needed to be protected from the influences of alcohol, the WONPR protested against the cultural effects of the prohibition. They saw the amendment as the cause of the increased crime and an attitude of resentment for the law. Though many believed that the 19th Amendment allowing women to vote would be the sustaining power behind the 18th amendment, Women were a highly influential force in overturning it. During all this political unrest, Capone remained quiet. Despite being married to one of the biggest names in bootlegging, she did not voice an opinion on prohibition. She certainly benefited from the amendment, as it created the demand for her husband‚Äôs line of work, but never publicly took a stand on her feelings about the matter. Her experience may be reflected in the stories of other mothers of the era. Pauline Sabin, founder of the WONPR, stated that many of the members of the organization fought for reform because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want their babies to grow up in the hip-flask, speakeasy atmosphere that has polluted their own youth. As far as exposure to this hip-flask culture, few were more exposed to it than Mae. Evidence suggests that she was concerned at the effect it might have on her son. It is reported that she actively discouraged her son Albert from following in his father‚Äôs footsteps. = Mae Capone in the public sector = Many women during this era took the opportunity to step out of anonymity and take the public spotlight. Pauline Morton Sabin was a good example of this. She wasn‚Äôt politically active when it came to fighting for women‚Äôs suffrage, but once it was granted she took full advantage of it. She became a vocal advocate for prohibition reform and helped create the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform. On the other side of the issue we have Ella Boole, the president of WCTU. She was a bold political activist and even went so far as to tell congress that she ‚ÄúSpoke for all women!‚Äù Mrs. Sabin was quick to refute this as were many others. While many women during this time took the opportunity to be more vocal, Mae sought anonymity and shelter from the press. Even when other gangsters' wives were coming out and writing books about their experiences regarding being married to mob members, Capone did not write or publish anything for the public to read. While other women fought to end prohibition, she fought for privacy.  In popular culture  * Josh Humphrey wrote a poem titled, \\"A Poem about Al Capone's Wife\\". The poem is written from Mae's point of view. It captures both the heartache and feelings of devotion she might have experienced. * Mae was portrayed by Linda Cardellini in the 2020 biographical film Capone.

He is portrayed by T. J. Thyne. Hodgins is introduced to the series primarily as an forensic entomologist, as well as a botanist, mineralogist, a forensic palynologist, and a forensic chemist; conspiracy theories are his hobby. During an investigation, he is primarily responsible for estimating time of death and examining trace evidence and particulates. Background and family Hodgins comes from an especially wealthy family and is the sole heir to the fictional private corporation known as the Cantilever Group, although he hid his wealth from his coworkers for a long time. Son of the late Jonathan and Anne Hodgins (\\"The Heiress in the Hill\\", season 9), Jack Hodgins is thought to have been an only child until he discovers in Season 9 that he has an older brother named Jeffrey, institutionalized with schizoaffective disorder. In \\"The Blonde in the Game\\", his uncle Preston is introduced. Hodgins' grandfather served as a \\"code- breaker\\" under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz during World War II. His family is the single largest donor to the Jeffersonian. In season 8, after serial killer Christopher Pelant hacks into Hodgins' savings and drains his bank accounts and the accounts of the entire Cantilever Group, he and Angela are forced to scrimp; yet, in season 9, he tells Dr. Sweets that he is content as he still has his work at the Jeffersonian and family‚Äîthe two things which he values the most. Hodgins, like Zack, was bullied in school: in elementary and middle school for being a \\"rich boy\\" and in high school for his small physical stature and diminished social skills. He \\"managed to stand up for himself\\" on the last day of senior year, which Sweets believes to have given him closure. Hodgins owns an original Mini, which Booth jokingly calls a \\"toy car\\", although in later seasons he is seen driving a Toyota Prius as well. He is an experienced cave diver. Although a noted conspiracy theorist, Hodgins temporarily abandons his paranoid thoughts and beliefs after it is revealed that his best friend, Zack Addy, has become the most recent apprentice to a cannibalistic serial killer known as \\"Gormogon\\". Devastated by his best friend's poor judgment, as well as his recent break-up with Angela, Hodgins finds his beliefs and feelings of paranoia turning into misanthropy. After being repeatedly confronted by Sweets about his behavior in the lab, Hodgins explains during a therapy session that he \\"hates everybody\\". Sweets determines that Hodgins' misanthropy is a way to cope with the overwhelming stresses in his life, and assures him that it will turn into something more pleasant in time. In \\"Aliens in the Spaceship\\", in season 2, Hodgins advances the notion of a \\"King of the Lab\\". Hodgins and Zack, and, later, other interns, compete sporadically and informally for this informal title by trying to come up with particularly crucial items of evidence in various investigations. Later in season 8, Hodgins loses his money due to the machinations of killer and hacker Christopher Pelant, who hacks Hodgins' accounts while using the same computer system to target a military drone at a school in Afghanistan, forcing Hodgins to sacrifice his money by allowing the computer to keep running so that the team can focus their efforts on hacking the drone and stopping the destruction of the school. In \\"The Maiden in the Mushrooms\\", after using the last of Finn's late grandmother's hot sauce, Hodgins deduces the ingredients and opens a side business called \\"Opie and Thurston's\\" to market a re-creation of the concoction. In season 10, in \\"The Eye in the Sky\\", Hodgins invents a packaging material and receives an advance of $2 million, restoring a portion of his wealth. In Season 11, a bomb planted at a crime scene causes Hodgins such serious injuries that he is left permanently paralysed from the waist down, with various subsequent episodes focusing on Hodgins adjusting to his new limitations and the team trying to help him cope. He experiences a few moments of movement, such as an involuntary muscle spasm in his leg, but the series ends with him still in his wheelchair, now acting as interim head of the lab while Cam and Arastoo are on their honeymoon. Work Hodgins has three doctorates, in entomology, botany, and geology/mineralogy. He is known around the Jeffersonian as the \\"bug and slime guy\\" and Booth often calls him \\"bug boy\\", a reference to Hodgins' expertise in and affection for all insects in general. During an investigation, he primarily deals with particulates and trace evidence and determines the time of death by examining insect activity. Hodgins eventually gets his own lab suite, known as the \\"Ookey Room\\", where he does most of his lab work, keeps his collection of arthropods, and performs most of his experiments. In episode 10 of season 4, \\"The Bones That Blew\\", Hodgins stated that his passion to \\"figure stuff out in amusing ways\\" was why he chose a career in science. In several episodes he has cooked edible food using the lab apparatus, much to his co-workers' bemusement. Characterization Hodgins is one of the more sarcastic members of the group, and initially deals with some anger management issues. He also had some initial difficulty in working with Dr Goodman, the Jeffersonian's administrator, as Dr Goodman frequently used conjecture or imagination to make inferences about the victims of crimes. He is sometimes \\"the funny man\\" with a notable impression of the character Seeley Booth. Hodgins is one of the more socially adept \\"squints\\" and uses pop-culture references and jokes that Dr. Brennan and Zack Addy often fail to grasp. As such, he has little difficulty \\"translating\\" scientific terms into layman terms to Booth and is sometimes exasperated when Zack fails to understand a joke or quip. Throughout the series, Hodgins has been known for his \\"insane conspiracy ravings\\", as Booth calls it, and in many of the show's early episodes his knowledge of conspiracy theories was demonstrated. In several cases, Booth, despite his disdain for most of Hodgins' conspiracy theories, uses it to his advantage for a case; in the episode \\"The Girl in Suite 2103\\" he asks Hodgins to call the FAA with his \\"craziest\\" conspiracy theory in order to stall a plane so the FBI can get to it in time to do a search. At the end of the episode when government agents come to take Hodgins away for questioning in relation to the hoax call, Booth declines to intervene telling Dr Brennan that being taken away by \\"Men in Black\\" would be his dream come true. Whenever different aspects of the government, such as the Department of Defense or the State Department, become involved in cases, Hodgins will often be the first to suggest that a cover-up is involved. In Seasons 9 and 10, his conspiracy theorist side comes to the fore and his theories often aid Booth and the team in finding clues in the major story arc in which the discovery of \\"The Ghost Killer\\" and her connections lead the team to uncover a widespread and deeply rooted conspiracy going on in the FBI. By the time of \\"High Treason in the Holiday Season\\", Booth and Hodgins have reached a stage where Hodgins not only takes Booth's perspective on exposing cover-ups into account but Booth is willing to acknowledge Hodgins' own perspectives; when the case sees the team acquire a hard drive of classified NSA operations, Hodgins agrees with Booth that they can't expose the data on it because it would put the NSA agents at risk even if the operations are technically illegal. Relationships =Romantic= Angela Montenegro After a few episodes of sexual tension, Hodgins takes Angela out on their first date to a park to play on swings. When he was buried alive with Dr. Brennan, Hodgins admitted to being in love with Angela, saying \\"I'm nuts about Angela. Over the moon, stupid in love with her.\\" Hodgins proposed to Angela twice before she turned the tables and proposed to him after he told her that love was enough. Their wedding is cut short in the season two finale when a State Department official interrupts the ceremony because routine federal-employee background investigations have revealed that Angela is technically married to a Fijian man named Grayson Barasa. Hodgins and Angela hire a private investigator to locate Angela's husband, and the investigator finds Angela's husband, Grayson Barasa, living on No Name Key in Florida. Hodgins and Angela ask Amber to force Grayson to sign the divorce papers. Grayson refuses to sign, claiming he still loves Angela and has even built a house for himself and her. Grayson is initially resistant to signing the divorce papers, which puts a strain on the relationship between Angela and Hodgins. They realize that they may not fully trust each other, and end their relationship. After their break-up when he learns that Angela's father (ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons) is in town, Hodgins awakes in the middle of a desert with a bandage on his shoulder, which he removes to reveal a tattoo of Angela's face along with the words \\"Angie Forever\\". After time apart, it is made clear that Hodgins still has feelings for Angela. After Booth is hospitalized for a brain tumor near the end of Season 4, Hodgins proposes giving his and Angela's relationship a second shot. While, in Season 5, they seem to be just friends, there are still signs of romantic tension between the two. In the episode \\"The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken\\", Angela mentions to Hodgins that her required celibacy period will soon be over and seems to hint that she would like to break it with Hodgins; Hodgins turns her down, despite her insistence that she was implying no such thing. In \\"The X in the File\\", when Wendell tells Hodgins of his relationship with Angela, Hodgins is shown to be very upset and hurt. During the next episode, \\"The Proof in the Pudding\\", Angela has a pregnancy scare; during this time, Hodgins tells her that he loves her and that he will be there to support her and the baby. While the pregnancy test was revealed to be a false positive at the end of the episode, Angela still tells Hodgins that she is grateful for his support and will never forget it. They were later imprisoned in \\"The Witch in the Wardrobe\\" for a variety of minor infractions by a local sheriff, which led to remembrance of their happiness together. They both realized that they regretted breaking up and shared a passionate kiss. When a judge arrived to post their bail, they were finally married in a private ceremony in the jail cell. They announced their marriage to their colleagues soon after. Upon their return from their honeymoon in Paris, it is revealed that they are expecting their first child, who will be named Temperance, if it's a girl, after Dr. Brennan. Angela's father wants to name their child \\"Staccato Mamba\\". It came to him in a song. Hodgins disagrees so he stands up to him and tells him \\"No\\".Episode 6/15, \\"The Killer in the Crosshairs. Finally he agrees with Angela and Hodgins on the names Katherine Temperance for a girl and Michael Joseph for a boy. Also in the end of the episode it was revealed that Hodgins got a tattoo of Angela's dad on his other arm which said \\"Dad\\". In the episode \\"The Blackout in the Blizzard\\" Angela and Hodgins find out they are both carriers of Leber's Congenital Amaurosis, giving their baby a 25 percent chance of blindness. This was a huge devastation for the couple, but in the end they reminded each other that they can handle anything together. Once the child was born, their son was confirmed to not be blind, and the two named him Michael Staccato Vincent Hodgins (named in honor of Vincent Nigel-Murray who was previously killed). =Colleagues= Hodgins' argumentative nature sometimes annoys his co-workers but he is on friendly terms with most of the team, including the interns. He was close to Zack Addy (who lived with Hodgins, renting the apartment above his garage) and would advise him on how to behave in a social setting, sometimes with humorously awkward results. Zack's social awkwardness and inability to understand Hodgins' sarcasm or pop culture references was sometimes a source of frustration, with Hodgins once calling the former a \\"dull Vulcan\\". Of the interns, Hodgins is particularly close to Wendell Bray, Finn Abernathy and Arastoo Vaziri. He initially had an awkward relationship with Wendell as the latter once dated Angela for a period of time and Angela had painted Wendell nude once. They later resolve the issue over time. Hodgins and Arastoo frequently chat about sports, especially basketball and baseball, while examining remains in the lab. When Arastoo admitted to faking his accent as a cover for his religiousness, Hodgins was one of the first to accept him without reservations after Arastoo explained how he reconciles his religion (Islam) with science. When Booth was appointed the FBI liaison to the Jeffersonian, Hodgins, who is anti-bureaucracy, was particularly hostile to him, especially for the early part of Season 1. Booth's military background, position as an FBI agent and patriotism further added to the tension. In \\"Two Bodies in the Lab\\" Booth went against protocol and allowed Hodgins to go with him to rescue Dr. Brennan - albeit because Hodgins was the only person available to drive him to help Brennan - and their animosity subsides from then on. Despite their opposing views, they are on friendly terms, with Hodgins expressing genuine regret when a current investigation exposed a military cover-up as he recognized what their discoveries meant for Booth. Hodgins also asked for Booth's advice when he was planning to propose to Angela. Most notably, when Agent Perotta ‚Äî who was officially working with the squints on a case where Booth was a prime suspect and thus unable to serve as the lead investigator ‚Äî commented that 'her' people had found some recent evidence in the case, Hodgins, along with intern Wendell automatically corrected her statement by saying that the squints were Booth's people. After Brennan, Hodgins is the 'squint' who has spent the most time out in the field with Booth ‚Äì discounting Dr. Camille Saroyan, who had prior experience working in law enforcement before joining the Jeffersonian ‚Äì occasionally accompanying Booth when investigations require on-site particulate analysis.

Generally, there are three basic forms of 10-pin bowling. The most basic form is known as stroking, which is the most classic form. The most powerful form is known as cranking, which imparts great leverage and maximum rotation on the ball, but sacrifices accuracy. In between the two is the domain of the tweener, who has characteristics of both, but does not truly fit into either category. A well- known variant of \\"tweening\\" is the power stroker. Power stroking is often very similar to cranking and bowlers can often fit in either category, therefore bowlers that use one of these two styles are often simply known as power players. A fourth style, known as helicopter, spinning, or UFO, is a style that is used to great effect in Asia. Finally, many modern bowlers have changed to a one- or two-handed no-thumb delivery. Most of the various forms use different wrist and hand positions and rely on different timings and body positions to accommodate the differences in each style of release. Conventional bowling form strike. This type of roll/hit applies to strokers, power strokers and crankers. A conventional bowling form is the most commonly used method in 10-pin bowling. There are many styles that can be used in a conventional bowling form. However, all of the styles have one thing in common: the method in which to achieve a strike. The following describes a strike for a right-handed bowler. A strike in conventional bowling is a specific method of knocking down all of the pins on the first ball. A conventional strike is when the ball utilizes the one-three pocket. A pocket is the area fronting the one and three pins. There are countless ways a bowler can achieve a strike. However, the goal for a bowler on every first ball is to achieve a strike using the method that generates the highest strike percentage. A perfect strike is a strike where the ball hits only four pins: the one, three, five and nine pins. The ball enters the one-three pocket, and then falls into the pit area to the right of where the eight pin previously stood. =Stroking= A stroker is a type of player in ten-pin bowling who releases his or her bowling ball in a smooth manner. They typically have rev rates less than 300 rpm. Strokers often keep their shoulders square to the foul line and their backswing generally does not go much above parallel to the ground. This type of release reduces the ball's rate of revolution, thus decreasing its hook potential and hitting power. Strokers rely on finesse and accuracy, as opposed to crankers, who use speed and power. However, today's modern reactive resin bowling balls now allow strokers to hit the \\"pocket\\" at a relatively high angle. Stroking is considered the most classic of all the bowling forms and is still the most popular style of bowling in the PBA. Although crankers are often considered to be more impressive to watch, strokers are often considered to have more repeatable and accurate shots. Strokers rely on smooth ball placement more than kinetic energy to fell pins. The all-time leader in titles and bowling earnings in the United States, Walter Ray Williams, Jr., is a stroker (though some consider his style unique and not easily classifiable). Other famous strokers include PBA Hall of Famers Norm Duke, David Ozio, and Dick Weber. Several high-profile left-handed bowlers, such as Hall of Famers Earl Anthony, Mike Aulby, Parker Bohn III and Mike Scroggins, are or were strokers, which has led to a stereotype in the bowling community that most left-handers are strokers who can only play the outside part of the lane. =\\"Tweening\\"= A tweener (a term derived from \\"in- between\\") is a bowler that delivers the ball in a manner that falls somewhere in between stroking and cranking. They have rev rates between 300 and 370 rpm. This modified delivery could use a higher backswing than is normally employed by a pure stroker or a less powerful wrist position than a pure cranker. Some use the term to refer to a bowler who is simply not a \\"picture perfect\\" example of either a stroker or a cranker. Notable tweeners include Brian Voss (primarily a stroker, but not \\"picture perfect\\"), Mika Koivuniemi (primarily a stroker, but with a high backswing), and Doug Kent (considered by some to be a power stroker). =Power Stroking= A variation on tweening is used by a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. It can also be used to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker). =Cranking/Power Player= A cranker or power player is a bowler who strives to generate revolutions using a cupped wrist or excessive wrist action. They have rev rates over 370 rpm. Crankers who rely on wrist action may have a high backswing and open their shoulders to generate ball speed. These bowlers often cup the wrist, but open the wrist at the top of the swing. Crankers may also muscle the ball with a bent elbow because their wrist is not strong enough to be cupped at the release. Crankers often use \\"late\\" timing, where the foot gets to the foul line before the ball; a technique known as plant and pull, hardly using any slide on their final step and pulling the ball upwards for leverage. The timing between the feet and the ball being delivered is only a fraction of a second. Even though the plant and pull bowler is sometimes used as another name for a cranker, it is rather misleading because some crankers slide more, while bowlers with other styles can also use this technique. The term \\"cranking\\" is used to describe the style of release and heavy wrist action that typifies crankers. Because of the high rev rate and power crankers have, they can throw powerful strikes even on less-than-perfect hits, but are more prone to splits rarely left by strokers or otherwise. Because many bowlers have a style that can be described as a cranker or a power stroker, the term power player is used for any bowler who can generate high revolutions or ball speed. Crankers sometimes stand to the extreme opposite side of the approach (relative to their target), and roll the ball over the middle lane boards out toward the gutter, using high revolutions to hook the ball back toward the pocket; this line is called \\"deep inside\\", \\"coast to coast\\", or \\"hooking the whole lane\\". Depending on the bowling ball, lane condition and bowler, the ball may exhibit either a rounded hook pattern or a later, more severe hook pattern known as skid-snap or skid-flip. Some crankers use a low backswing but have a cupped wrist in order to generate high revolutions; this was the \\"old-fashioned\\" way of cranking. Notable bowlers with such a style include Jim Godman, Bob Learn, Jr., Ryan Shafer, Kelly Coffman, and Bob Vespi. Mark Roth was among the first bowlers to crank the ball using a high backswing and excessive wrist action. Other bowlers who followed this style include Amleto Monacelli, Jason Couch and, more recently, E. J. Tackett. Bowlers like Robert Smith, Mike Fagan, and Tommy Jones are often considered crankers due to their high backswings and RPM rates, but each has a smooth release and slide, so they can also be classified as power strokers. The myth that crankers are not good spare shooters is not always supported. Roth, for example, was one of the best spare shooters on tour in his day, and was the first person to convert the nearly-impossible 7-10 split on national television. Robert Smith and Jason Couch also both posted very high spare-conversion percentages. Ball speed Bowling ball delivery speed is affected primarily by three factors: gravity, the bowler's forward speed, and downswing acceleration. A longer arm or higher backswing height increase the speed that gravity produces. Forward momentum is also imparted to the ball by the bowler's walking speed.Martin, Charles L. \\"Generating Bowling Ball Speed.\\" Athletic Journal 54 (1984). Finally, deliberate forward acceleration of the arm during the downswing affects delivery speed. Spinning A spinning movement of the bowling ball will actually spin away from the 1-pin (right-hander) as it hits it, and then continues the left-to-right direction by hitting the 3, 6 and 10 pins. This type of hit causes a domino effect on the entire rack. Spinners use a style of release known variously as spinning, helicopter, or UFO. Regardless of what it's known as, a spinner releases a ball such that it is rotating around the vertical axis in a counter clockwise motion (right-hander, and viewed from above) as it moves down the lane. Spinning is a popular style in Asia, especially Taiwan, where lanes are usually oiled from the foul line to the pin rack, and present little to no opportunity for a ball thrown in one of the three more orthodox fashions to find friction on any part of the lane. A hook needs friction, in order to allow the ball to \\"grab\\" the lane. In spinning, very little of the ball's surface touches the lane, which is what the spinner intends. Spinning does not require friction of any kind. The objective in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than \\"carry\\" (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes the right side of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as \\"riding the rail\\" among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball moves down the row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as \\"mixing\\"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes. Because spinners do not want the ball to grab onto the lane with its surface, they often use \\"plastic\\" bowling balls - balls with the older polyester cover-stock popular in the 1970s and 1980s, and commonly used as house balls today - in comparison to the widely used polyurethane, \\"particle\\" (polyurethane with nigh-microscopic glass spheres or other hard material throughout the coverstock) and \\"reactive resin\\" balls (\\"reactive resin\\" is itself polyurethane manufactured using a process to leave microscopic pores throughout it, essentially, a hard sponge) used by bowlers who desire a ball that will grip the lane and roll strongly. Additionally, because the chances of injury are somewhat elevated with this style of bowling, as well as the advantage of ball deflection with this style, the spinner will have a tendency to use lightweight balls between ten and twelve pounds. Some hook bowlers can also spin and roll the ball at the same time, keeping the ball in-between the X and Y axis. This allows not only for carry of the pins, but also additional pin deflection for when the ball is off- target. Tom Baker and Ryan Shafer of the PBA Tour, and Miki Nishimura of the JPBA are known to use this technique. In tournaments within countries like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning can be an advantage over rolling. However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from the foul line to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the pin rack, spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of knocking pins down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin. Other bowling forms =No-thumb delivery= A no-thumb delivery involves inserting only two fingers into the bowling ball, leaving the thumb on the outside of the ball, in an effort to create more revolutions and greater hook. Due to similar ball roll and revolutions to the cranker style, it is sometimes considered a variation of cranking. As the bowler does not use the opposite hand to support the ball (as in the two-handed approach), the wrist is often severely cupped and/or the ball is balanced on the forearm and delivered using a bent elbow throughout the shot. Another variation of this delivery is to palm the ball forcing the thumb to the side of the ball while forcing the elbow to lock so as to keep the arm straight and generate a back-swing. This variation leads to far greater consistency and straightens the ball out when needed. All styles of no-thumbing usually require bowlers to use bowling balls that are generally one to three pounds lighter than their thumb-in counterparts. This technique is often used by casual or league-level bowlers who have not learned how to hook the ball using one of the more standard, thumb-in grips. It is also prevalent among left-handed bowlers using house balls. A left-handed bowler would have to reverse the ball in order to properly use the holes typically drilled for right-handed bowlers. Notable bowlers to use this technique at the professional level include Mike Miller and Tom Daugherty. Another successful no-thumb bowler is Eric Copping, who holds the Vermont state record for average in a season with 246 and, as of April 2019, has bowled over one hundred perfect games and over ninety 800 series, with a best of 878. =Half-thumb variation= The half-thumb variation is a technique employed by Tom Smallwood, the surprise winner of the 2009 PBA World Championship, and involves putting the thumb in the ball only up to the first knuckle. Thus, the ball is thrown almost entirely with the fingers as a \\"no thumb\\" bowler would throw it, with the thumb only providing some control during the backswing. Smallwood also keeps two hands on the bowling ball until roughly midway through his approach. =Two-handed approach= A two-handed approach is a bowling technique whereupon the throwing hand is in the bowling ball and the opposite hand is also placed on the ball during the shot. This is an evolution of the one-handed no-thumb technique, where a bowler would generate similar revolutions but could not be as effective because their opposite hand does not support the ball through the approach. Traditionally, in two handed bowling, two fingers are inserted into the ball with the thumb left out. The dominant hand is then used to cradle the ball and creates extra spin on the release. Then, the opposite hand is used to guide the ball through the throwing motion, with the ball delivered shovel- style. Two handed bowlers are forced to flex forward farther and rotate their hips more than a single handed bowler. These bowlers are placing more torque through the spine in order to increase the ball speed and revolution rate. This form of bowling, if done correctly, increases force, revolutions and pin carry. A two handed bowler's revolution rate can reach up to 600 revolutions per minute, which is up to 17% more rotation than the nearest elite single handed bowler and twice what some top professional bowlers generate.Thompson, Adam. \\"Young Australian Puts a New Spin on Bowling: He Throws Two-Handed\\", The Wall Street Journal, 5 February 2009. The two-handed approach should not be confused with the two-handed delivery. Just prior to the release of the ball, a bowler using a two-handed approach removes their supporting hand, effectively delivering the ball with only one hand. They are considered a one- handed bowler by governing bodies, and must follow appropriate rules regarding switching dominant hands during competition. An actual two-handed delivery involves using both hands simultaneously to give force to the ball and is extremely rare in adult competition; it is mostly seen with young children first learning the game. Australian Jason Belmonte was among the first bowlers to gain worldwide recognition for using the two-handed approach style. Others that followed include Finn Osku Palermaa, Swede Jesper Svensson, and Americans Kyle Troup and Anthony Simonsen. American Chaz Dennis, who as a 10 year old became the second-youngest person ever to bowl a 300 game, also uses this technique. The bowling team of Bolivia is also noted for changing its bowlers to using the two-handed approach style. While used by just a handful of veteran professional players, this style is becoming popular with young bowlers. A Bowlers Journal International article in 2018 states that 21% of the junior bowlers at the recently completed USBC Junior Gold Championships used the two-handed approach style. This includes 25% of bowlers in the U12 category (ages 12 and under), 24% of U15 bowlers, and 19% of U20 bowlers. =Full roller= Full roller is a style of bowling that traces its origins to the earliest days of bowling. Many top champions of the past were full rollers such as Ned Day and Billy Hardwick. There are also some modern full rollers such as Dave Ewald and Tom Smallwood. A full roller rolls the ball in such a way that the ball tracks over its full circumference, thus the name full roller. In addition to a full circumference ball track, the ball track itself crosses between the fingers and thumb through the palm in a diagonal path. A full roller release can be very straight such as Billy Hardwick rolled, or have up to a 90 degree or greater axis of rotation such as Tom Smallwood rolls. Usually a suitcase style grip with the thumb in the 9 o'clock position and the fingers in the 3 o'clock position (for a right hander) at the moment of release will create a full roller track. As the hand comes forward the thumb exits first, and the fingers still at 3 o'clock, lift up through the ball, causing it to rotate off the fingers to the left, creating side rotation and a horizontal track through the palm center of the ball.

Career Eydelie was born in Angoul√™me, Charente. A midfielder, he began his career with Nantes, before joining Marseille in 1992. His first season at Marseille was a success, with the club finishing top of the league, and winning the Champions League, but shortly after the Champions League final, it was revealed that he had contacted three players at Ligue 1 club Valenciennes (Jorge Burruchaga, Christophe Robert and Jacques Glassman) on behalf of the Marseille board, in order to offer bribes. Marseille needed to beat Valenciennes to secure the championship, and had induced the Valenciennes players to \\"go easy\\" in order that the Marseille players would not be overly exerted before the Champions League final. It was Glassman who reported the bribe, which resulted in Marseille being stripped of the 1993 French title, banned from defending the Champions League (although the win still stood), and relegated to Ligue 2. Eydelie was banned for a year by FIFA, given a one-year suspended sentence, and served 17 days in prison. Members of the Marseille board were given longer prison sentences, and Valenciennes players Burruchaga and Robert received FIFA bans for their involvement. Upon his return to football, Eydelie had a nomadic career. He trained for a few months at Benfica, played in England, Switzerland and back in France before retiring in 2003. From 2006 to 2007 he was the manager of amateur club Limoges Foot 87. In 2006, Eydelie released his autobiography, telling of corruption and doping during his time at Marseille. Former OM chairman Bernard Tapie sued unsuccessfully for libel (which he is planning to appeal), and former teammate Didier Deschamps has also threatened legal action.

Training In order to have a SAT Specialization, it is necessary to successfully complete the 50-week SAT (Marine Commando) Specialized Course. The first phase starts with 8 weeks of physical and fitness development. After these trainings, the trainee who passes the physical and physical exams at sea and land passes to the underwater phase and is taken to the frog-man training for 8 weeks.After these phases are passed, the land phase begins. In the land phase, it is called hell week after training on gaining a high level of land condition, swimming long distances in the water and getting on the boat, VBSS , performing the task under pressure, getting rid of captivity, sea threats and long distance in the land, finding targets. After intensive training, the land phase is completed. With these trainings, they have the skills to sneak, sabatoge and raid the enemy's coastal and floating targets.Then, trainings using mostly tactical floating platforms and aircraft are taken. They train about 15 hours a day.

This arrangement allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground, facilitating service and repair. VAWTs do not need to be pointed into the wind, which removes the need for wind-sensing and orientation mechanisms. Major drawbacks for the early designs (Savonius, Darrieus and giromill) included the significant torque variation or \\"ripple\\" during each revolution, and the large bending moments on the blades. Later designs addressed the torque ripple issue by sweeping the blades helically (Gorlov type).Analysis of Different Blade Architectures on small VAWT Performance A vertical axis wind turbine has its axis perpendicular to the wind streamlines and vertical to the ground. A more general term that includes this option is \\"transverse axis wind turbine\\" or \\"cross-flow wind turbine.\\" For example, the original Darrieus patent, US Patent 1835018, includes both options. Drag-type VAWTs such as the Savonius rotor typically operate at lower tipspeed ratios than lift-based VAWTs such as Darrieus rotors and cycloturbines. General aerodynamics The forces and the velocities acting in a Darrieus turbine are depicted in figure 1. The resultant velocity vector, \\\\vec{W}, is the vectorial sum of the undisturbed upstream air velocity, \\\\vec{U}, and the velocity vector of the advancing blade, -\\\\vec{\\\\omega }\\\\times\\\\vec{R}. \\\\vec{W}=\\\\vec{U}+\\\\left( -\\\\vec{\\\\omega }\\\\times\\\\vec{R} \\\\right) Fig1: Forces and velocities acting in a Darrieus turbine for various azimuthal positions A helical Darrieus turbine Thus the oncoming fluid velocity varies during each cycle. Maximum velocity is found for \\\\theta =0{}^\\\\circ and the minimum is found for \\\\theta =180{}^\\\\circ , where \\\\theta is the azimuthal or orbital blade position. The angle of attack, \\\\alpha , is the angle between the oncoming air speed, W, and the blade's chord. The resultant airflow creates a varying, positive angle of attack to the blade in the upstream zone of the machine, switching sign in the downstream zone of the machine. It follows from geometric considerations of angular velocity as seen in the accompanying figure that: V_t=R \\\\omega + U\\\\cos(\\\\theta) and: V_n=U \\\\sin(\\\\theta) Solving for the relative velocity as the resultant of the tangential and normal components yields: W= \\\\sqrt{V_t^2+V_n^2} Thus, combining the above with the definitions for the tip speed ratio \\\\lambda =(\\\\omega R) /U yields the following expression for the resultant velocity: W=U\\\\sqrt{1+2\\\\lambda \\\\cos \\\\theta +\\\\lambda ^{2}} Vertical Axis Wind Turbine development, Guilherme Silva Angle of attack is solved as: \\\\alpha = \\\\tan^{-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{V_n}{V_t} \\\\right) Which when substituting the above yields: \\\\alpha =\\\\tan ^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\theta }{\\\\cos \\\\theta +\\\\lambda } \\\\right) The resultant aerodynamic force is resolved either into lift (L) - drag (D) components or normal (N) - tangential (T) components. The forces are considered acting at the quarter-chord point, and the pitching moment is determined to resolve the aerodynamic forces. The aeronautical terms \\"lift\\" and \\"drag\\" refer to the forces across (lift) and along (drag) the approaching net relative airflow. The tangential force acts along the blade's velocity, pulling the blade around, and the normal force acts radially, pushing against the shaft bearings. The lift and the drag force are useful when dealing with the aerodynamic forces around the blade such as dynamic stall, boundary layer etc.; while when dealing with global performance, fatigue loads, etc., it is more convenient to have a normal-tangential frame. The lift and the drag coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of the relative airflow, while the normal and tangential coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of undisturbed upstream fluid velocity.

Advantages VAWTs offer a number of advantages over traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs): * Being omni-directional, some forms do not need to track the wind. This means they don't require a complex mechanism and motors to yaw the rotor and pitch the blades. * VAWTs generally function better than HAWTs in turbulent and gusty winds. HAWTs cannot efficiently harvest such winds, which also cause accelerated fatigue. * the gearbox of a VAWT takes much less fatigue than that of a HAWT. * In VAWTs, gearbox replacement and maintenance are simpler and more efficient, as the gearbox is accessible at ground level, so that no cranes or other large equipment are needed on-site. This reduces costs and impact on the environment. Motor and gearbox failures generally are significant considerations in the operation and maintenance of HAWTs both on and offshore. * some designs of VAWTs in suitable situations can use screw pile foundations, which hugely reduces the road transport of concrete and the carbon cost of installation. Screw piles can be fully recycled at the end of their life. * wings of the Darrieus type have a constant chord and so are easier to manufacture than the blades of a HAWT, which have a much more complex shape and structure. * VAWTs can be grouped more closely in wind farms, increasing the generated power per unit of land area. * VAWTs can be installed on HAWT wind farm below the existing HAWTs; this can supplement the power output of the existing farm. * research at Caltech has also shown that a carefully designed wind farm using VAWTs can have an output power ten times that of a HAWT wind farm of the same size.  Disadvantages  One of the major outstanding challenges facing vertical axis wind turbine technology is dynamic stall of the blades as the angle of attack varies rapidly. The blades of a VAWT are fatigue-prone due to the wide variation in applied forces during each rotation. This can be overcome by the use of modern composite materials and improvements in design - including the use of aerodynamic wing tips that cause the spreader wing connections to have a static load. The vertically oriented blades can twist and bend during each turn, causing them to break apart. VAWTs have proven less reliable than HAWTs, although modern designs of VAWTs have overcome many of the issues associated with early designs. Applications Light pole wind turbine The Windspire, a small VAWT intended for individual (home or office) use was developed in the early 2000s by US company Mariah Power. The company reported that several units had been installed across the US by June 2008. Arborwind, an Ann-Arbor (Michigan, US) based company, produces a patented small VAWT which has been installed at several US locations as of 2013. In 2011, Sandia National Laboratories wind- energy researchers began a five-year study of applying VAWT design technology to offshore wind farms. The researchers stated: \\"The economics of offshore windpower are different from land-based turbines, due to installation and operational challenges. VAWTs offer three big advantages that could reduce the cost of wind energy: a lower turbine center of gravity; reduced machine complexity; and better scalability to very large sizes. A lower center of gravity means improved stability afloat and lower gravitational fatigue loads. Additionally, the drivetrain on a VAWT is at or near the surface, potentially making maintenance easier and less time-consuming. Fewer parts, lower fatigue loads and simpler maintenance all lead to reduced maintenance costs.\\" A 24-unit VAWT demonstration plot was installed in southern California in the early 2010s by Caltech aeronautical professor John Dabiri. His design was incorporated in a 10-unit generating farm installed in 2013 in the Alaskan village of Igiugig. Dulas, Anglesey received permission in March 2014 to install a prototype VAWT on the breakwater at Port Talbot waterside. The turbine is a new design, supplied by Wales-based C-FEC (Swansea), and will be operated for a two-year trial. This VAWT incorporates a wind shield which blocks the wind from the advancing blades, and thus requires a wind-direction sensor and a positioning mechanism, as opposed to the \\"egg-beater\\" types of VAWTs discussed above. 4 Navitas (Blackpool) have been operating two prototype VAWTs since June 2013, powered by a Siemens Power Train, they are due to enter the market in January 2015, with a free technology share to interested parties. 4 Navitas are now in the process of scaling their prototype to 1 MW, (working with PERA Technology) and then floating the turbine on an offshore pontoon. This will reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. The Dynasphere, is Michael Reynolds' (known for his Earthship house designs) 4th generation vertical axis windmill.

Flesher in captain's militia uniform, circa 1866William Kingston Flesher (June 10, 1825 - July 22, 1907) was a settler of southwestern Ontario, a militia officer, businessman and political figure. As well as founding the village of Flesherton, he represented the riding of Grey East in the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative member from 1872 to 1878. Early life Flesher was born in Kingston-upon-Hull, England in 1825, the eldest child of Rev. John Flesher, a Methodist preacher and Jane (n√©e Cawood) Flesher. He was educated and spent his formative years in England. After he married Jane Foster in 1847 at the age of 22, they emigrated to Canada West. Settler Flesher first moved to Bolton, Ontario, where he helped to run a mill with his brother John. However, Flesher sensed that he would never make his fortune as an employee, and cast about for a better opportunity. The colonial government was granting 50-acre plots of land to settlers on the understanding that if the settler was able to clear twelve of the fifty acres within five years, the settler would be given free title to the entire plot. Flesher travelled north to the newly surveyed Artemesia Township in Grey County, and was settled on 50 acres of land at Artemesia Corners, the intersection of the Toronto-Syndenham and Durham Roads (later provincial Highways 10 & 4). He was only the second settler in the area, the first being Aaron Munshaw Jr., a former Reformer who had recently returned from exile after the failed Upper Canada Rebellion. Munshaw had been granted land on the east side of the Toronto-Sydenham Road straddling the Durham Road, and had built a small tavern at the intersection. Flesher's land grant was on the opposite side of the road. Both men laid out the parts of their land grants as village plots, and sold them to tradesmen and others eager to move to the area. Flesher also built a saw mill and a grist mill on the nearby Boyne River, and eventually built a large house for his family. As the area was settled, Flesher continued to be a prominent local figure, acting at various times as postmaster (1865‚Äì1867 and 1869‚Äì1872), magistrate, druggist, and even doctor. He was a vocal booster of the village, and convinced other businesses to settle in the area, and also organized a Masonic Lodge. In recognition of his contributions, the name of the settlement was changed to Flesher's Corners. In 1866, in response to the Fenian Raids, Flesher became captain of the local militia, No. 6 Company of the 31st Grey Regiment. In 1867, the settlement had grown to the point where a more \\"village-like\\" name was seen as desirable, and the name was changed to Flesherton.A History of the county of Grey, EL Marsh (1931) Flesher was also involved in local construction, and in 1868, for $565, was awarded the contract to rebuild Osprey School Section No. 9, a one-room school that had burned down the previous year. In 1876, Flesher donated some of his land for construction of a permanent Methodist church. The red brick church was finished a year later, and dedicated on 18 November 1877 by Minister of Education Egerton Ryerson. Politician Flesher served as Warden of Grey County (1855‚Äì1857, 1861‚Äì1862, 1865 and 1867), and Reeve of the village (1854‚Äì1865 and 1866‚Äì1878). In 1867, he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature, but in 1872, as a Conservative, he was elected to the House of Commons as the first MP for the new riding of Grey East. He served in John A. Macdonald's Opposition, and was re-elected in 1874 before retiring in 1878 to make way for Thomas Simpson Sproule, the man who would marry his daughter Mary Alice in 1881.The Canadian parliamentary companion HJ Morgan (1873) Family Flesher and his wife Jane raised five children: *Jane, born 1850, married and became Mrs. W. Ainsley. *John (\\"Jack\\"), born 1852, moved to Parry Sound, Ontario with his wife Mary Anne and seven children. In 1902, when his employer sent him to New Zealand to supervise the construction of New Zealand's first saw mill, his wife Mary Anne and his children remained behind in Canada. Two years later, Jack received word that his wife had died, and he subsequently never returned to Canada. He married a Maori woman, Tare Doris Wikaira, and raised another three children in New Zealand. *Mary Alice, born 1854, married Thomas Simpson Sproule, a local businessman from nearby Markdale who had succeeded William Flesher as the local MP in 1878 and subsequently served eight consecutive terms, eventually becoming Speaker of the House of Commons from 1911 to 1915, and a member of the Senate from 1915 until his death in 1917. T.S. Sproule's niece was Elizabeth Sproule, who together with her husband John Head, cared for her young nephew, and later NHL owner, Harvey Sproule and his sister.http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2493114/page/2 *William Henry, born 1856, also stayed in the area and worked as a businessman and artist, but died at the relatively young age of 42 in 1898. *an adopted daughter Ida Several other young Fleshers lived in the area, including Thomas, William and Jack. Although some assumed that these were W.K. Flesher's nephews or cousins, a popular local rumour of the time ‚Äî fuelled by his many trips back to his native England ‚Äî held that he actually had a second wife living in England, and these other Fleshers were actually his children. Flesher's younger brother John lived in the Flesherton area for several years before moving to Orangeville, Ontario, where he served as the district's MPP in the Ontario legislative assembly for 4 years. Death Flesher travelled back to England frequently ‚Äî his wife's obituary says he returned more than 35 times. During one such visit in 1907, he died at the age of 82 in Carnarvon, Wales. Flesher's wife Jane survived him by 4 years, dying in 1911. She was buried in Flesherton Cemetery beside her son William Henry. Although descendants of her daughters continued to live in the area, her older son John and his family had moved away from the area, and her younger son William Henry had died without sons, making Jane the last Flesher to live in Flesherton.

He was the last president of the Federal Republic of Central America (1839‚Äì40), during its disintegration. He was also chief of state of the federal states of Honduras (1829) and El Salvador (1836‚Äì37 and 1837‚Äì38). Background and early political career Diego Vigil was the son of Jos√© Vigil Fern√°ndez and Josefa Coca√±a F√°brega. He was related to the Central American Liberal leader, general and president, Francisco Moraz√°n, and was among his closest fellow combatants. Vigil studied law at the University of Le√≥n in Le√≥n, Nicaragua, and was afterwards temporarily active as a lawyer and notary in Tegucigalpa. In 1824 he was a member of the federal parliament. In 1826-27, he was governor of the province of Tegucigalpa, but after the occupation of that city by the troops of federal President Manuel Jos√© Arce, he was arrested. When Moraz√°n reconquered Honduras, Vigil was freed. As chief of state of Honduras After Moraz√°n's victory in the Battle of Trinidad (10 November 1827), the Legislative Assembly of Honduras named Vigil vice-chief of state on 27 November 1827. Moraz√°n later made him chief of state of Honduras (7 March 1829 to 2 December 1829). During his term of office, the Legislative Assembly dissolved the religious communities in Honduras. Their goods passed to the state, and several monasteries and other buildings were occupied as public buildings. As chief of state of El Salvador General Moraz√°n made him chief of state of the state of El Salvador, effective 1 February 1836. He served until 23 May 1837, and then again from 7 July 1837 to 6 January 1838. During his administration a cholera epidemic broke out in El Salvador, spread by pilgrims returning from the shrine of Esquipulas. Because of the cholera, the government stopped all payments except for public employees, in order to devote the resources to fighting the epidemic. By January 1837, the cholera had spread to all the populations of the state. The state government established sanitary committees to meet in the capitals of the departments. In March 1836 Licenciado and General Nicol√°s Espinoza, former chief of state of the state of El Salvador, was expelled from the state, and his title of Benemerito de la Patria was withdrawn. On 8 January 1837, the Legislative Assembly passed the annual budget, totaling 85,028 pesos. It also authorized the introduction of water into the town of San Miguel. On 23 May 1837 an insurrection of natives in Zacatecoluca and Cojutepeque broke out, with much killing and pillaging. On the same day, the office of chief of state passed from Vigil to Timoteo Men√©ndez. Vigil returned to office six weeks later, on 7 July. In June 1837 a revolutionary movement erupted in Santa Ana, but it was suppressed. The government decreed amnesty for the participants in the various revolutionary movements. On 6 January 1838, Timoteo Men√©ndez again became chief of state. As president of the federal republic After federal Vice President Gregorio Salazar was killed during the occupation of Guatemala City by the rebel forces of Rafael Carrera, Vigil was selected to succeed him (1 February 1838). Moraz√°n was then in his second term as president of the federation. On 1 February 1839, Moraz√°n turned the presidency over to Vigil. Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica had withdrawn from the federation in 1838, and soon Guatemala followed suit (17 April 1839). This left the \\"federation\\" with only one member, El Salvador. On 31 March 1840, El Salvador dissolved the federation and Vigil's term came to an end. Later years On 8 April 1840 Diego Vigil and Francisco Moraz√°n sailed from El Salvador for Costa Rica and Panama. After Moraz√°n's execution on 15 September 1842 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, Vigil settled in Granada, Nicaragua, where he remained until his death in 1845.

The current brick building replaced a wooden structure that was built in the early 1900s. It is directly across from the entrance to The Greenbrier grounds. The original cottages that eventually expanded to a resort property known as the Old White Hotel, was purchased by C&O; in 1910. The hotel was renovated and reopened in 1913 as the Greenbrier. The hotel became a showcase for the railroad company and it was promoted in C&O;'s timetables and literature. Tracks behind the station were used for parking business-owned and private cars of the wealthy patrons that came to the hotel. The hotel stayed in the hands of C&O; and its successors, Chessie System and CSX, until 2009. The former station building now serves as the hotel's own Christmas gift shop.

It was demolished due to a sinkhole located on-site. The theater reopened at its new location on February 8, 2008.  Original Magic Lantern  The original theater, which had a Victorian-style lobby, opened in 1929 as the \\"New Meserve Theater\\" followed by \\"The Mayfair\\", \\"The Brookside\\" and finally in 1977 \\"The Magic Lantern\\" by entrepreneur Tom Goodman. Goodman secured the worldwide premier of author Stephen King's The Shining at the Magic Lantern. King pulled the strings to get the print for this benefit screening for the local hospital fundraiser. The Magic Lantern was also the first theater in Maine to install Dolby Stereo Surround sound. The theater closed in the late 1980s and was run for a year by the town of Bridgton's recreation department. The following year the local Howell family purchased the building. The family business, Down East, Inc., had occupied the ground floor for many years while the theater occupied the 2nd floor. The family decided to reopen the single screen theater and to bring movies back to Bridgton. In 1990, the theater was twinned to increase the number of movie choices. However, the condition of \\"The Brookside Building\\" as it was known by locals, had deteriorated due to poor soil conditions that existed on the site. Sloping floors, cracked foundations, freezing pipes and the physical sinking of the building sealed its fate. On February 7, 2006 the theater was torn down. Down East, Inc. presented to the Town of Bridgton a plan to redevelop the entire site which included a new building for its operations on the site behind the old theater and a New Magic Lantern theater.  New Magic Lantern  The new Magic Lantern officially began construction on March 1, 2007 and reopened on February 8, 2008. It features four screens (three with old fashioned balconies. The other screen is featured as a pub/caf√©, and can be used to show live, televised events. The largest theater features a stage, and has been used for performances. Three of the screens are named after former Bridgton Theaters: The Meserve, The Mayfair, and The Brookside. The Brookside has nautical theming, the Meserve has 1920's theming, and the Mayfair has general Victorian theming. The pub, called the Tannery, is named after the Gibb's Tannery that used to be located on the site. It has a Medieval European theme, with dishes being named after the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Magic Lantern in former Czechoslovakia  A theater bearing the name Laterna Magika, or Magic Lantern, was also located in the former Czechoslovakia, and served as one of the principal meeting places during the Velvet Revolution in which the country overthrew their governing communist regime in favor of democracy. The Magic Lantern has been described as headquarters to the Czech part of the revolution.

Its objective was to clear Helmand province of the Taliban. The operation began on March 6, 2007. The offensive is the largest NATO-based operation in Afghanistan to date. NATO officials reported that, contrary to previous operations, Taliban fighters were avoiding direct confrontation in favor of guerilla tactics. It was led by British ISAF forces and focused on the Kajakai Dam and the towns in the area, which is a major power source for Afghanistan that had not been functioning for a number of years. One part of the mission was Operation Volcano, where British Royal Marines successfully cleared a large Taliban complex near the Kajakai Dam,Royal Marines clear Taliban from key Afghan dam, UK Ministry of Defence as well as Operation Kryptonite which actually saw the clearing of the dam by allied forces. Background On March 16, U.S. General Dan McNeill reported that NATO forces were battling insurgents in various places in Southern Afghanistan but that most of the rebel fighters were steering clear of Western troops. He also said that NATO would launch new operations against the Taliban during the spring and summer. Operation Operation Volcano, part of Operation Achilles, saw British Royal Marines clear a Taliban base, consisting of 25 compounds, near the Kajaki hydroelectric dam. The Royal Marines received heavy fire from Taliban assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The Royal Marines systematically cleared the compounds and buildings, backed up by mortars and air support.Marines clear Taliban from key Afghan dam - UK MoD On April 3, United States and Afghan forces raided a compound in the Helmand province, after getting a tip-off that a junior Taliban commander was hiding there. Indeed, Taliban forces were present. Heavy fighting broke out, which left at least 10 Taliban dead and two captured. The coalition had no casualties. The fate of the junior commander remains unknown. On April 30, 1,000 ISAF troops, alongside Afghan National Army ground forces, pushed northwards through the Sangin Valley driving the Taliban from Gereshk and the surrounding villages.On the heels of Achilles, UK Ministry of Defence It was reported that coalition troops killed more than 130 Taliban fighters, but thousands of Afghans staged a protest saying the victims were civilians. Backed by air support, the Taliban fighters were killed in two separate battles in the western province of Herat, according to a US military statement. As part of the operation, British Royal Engineers built company sized patrol bases for the Afghan National Security Forces. The deaths triggered an angry protest - the second in the country in two days - over what local villagers claimed was the killing of civilians. Herat, bordering Iran, had been relatively safe until recently compared with the south and east where the Taliban are most active. Both battles were in the Zerkoh valley, south of Shindand district, where Western troops have a large base, and running into Farah province further south. A total of 87 Taliban fighters were killed during a 14-hour battle with US-led troops and Afghan forces on Sunday. Another 49 Taliban, including two of their leaders, were killed two days earlier after a group of Taliban fired at a joint coalition and Afghan patrol in another part of the valley. However, local officials said that up to 51 civilians, including women and children, were among the dead.

History The roller coaster was designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Its serial number is 86. In 1930, it was installed under the name \\"Roller Coaster\\" at Lakewood Park in Waterbury, Connecticut. Frank F. Hoover oversaw the construction. The coaster operated in Connecticut for only five years before being closed and moved to Canobie Lake Park. It was rechristened the \\"Greyhound\\" in 1935, and then eventually it was renamed the \\"Yankee Canonball\\" in 1983. The name is in commemoration of the American Civil War. The coaster's train colors were originally blue and gray, representing the Union and Confederate sides of the conflict, all being united on the ride's red, white, and blue superstructure. When the ride was moved to Canobie in 1936, each section was shortened by six inches to help it fit the area planned for it. The rethemed ride opened for the 1936 season and has operated continuously since, though the lift hill was destroyed by Hurricane Carol in 1954, and it was closed for repair during the following season. The coaster's coloring has been altered since 1936 with retracking work done on the coaster. Some of this retracking was completed by Martin & Vleminckx. As of the 2009 season, the ride superstructure is white with orange handrails. One train is colored red, white and blue, while the other is hunter green and orange. The coaster is one of the first rides seen when entering the park's parking lot. On June 20, 2013, the Yankee Cannonball was awarded the prestigious Coaster Landmark Award by ACE for its historical significance, thus cementing its status as a historic, cultural treasure. Layout The ride's layout is an out and back pattern with a 90¬∞ turn in the middle, creating the basic L-shape common in early wooden coasters. The primary elements include small hills designed to give moments of airtime and strongly banked turns. Restraints on the trains used to consist of a single lap bar with no seat belts allowing single riders to slide across the seat, making full use of the banked turns. Seat belts and center seat dividers were later added. Once the site of an infield, the area inside the L-shape is now employee parking for the park. Upon dispatch, the train takes a slight downward grade through a right turn into the 65' lift hill. The ride's initial drop is the largest at 63' 6\\". This is followed by a short airtime rise, then the second hill which has the 90¬∞ right turn at the top. Two small airtime rises precede the steeply banked 180¬∞ turnaround. The returning course takes the coaster parallel to the first half of the ride, traveling through a series of bunny hills, the brake run and a short turn into the station. The total duration of the ride is about one minute with a top speed of 35 mph. Trains The Yankee Cannonball has two trains, with three cars per train, but only one train runs at a time. Riders are arranged two across in three rows in each car for a total of 18 riders per train. The trains were built by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Restraints consist of headrests and lap bars, and seat belts were added for the 2003 season, as a response to a 2001 accident, in which the two trains collided at the foot of the lift hill due to operator failure in engaging the brakes.CoasterBuzz article: Five suffer minor injuries as trains collide at Canobie References Category:Roller coasters in New Hampshire Category:Buildings and structures in Rockingham County, New Hampshire Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1930 Category:Salem, New Hampshire ","title":"Yankee Cannonball"},{"id":"9902115","text":"Amyas Evelyn Giles Baring (1910‚Äì1986), known as Giles Baring, was an English first-class cricketer between the years 1930 and 1946.

Knob Creek Gun Range (also referred to as Knob Creek Range or simply Knob Creek) is an outdoor shooting range located in Bullitt County, Kentucky, United States, near the community of West Point, Kentucky.The range is served by the West Point post office, which lies in Hardin County, but the range itself lies in Bullitt County. The range is a former military-munitions test range. As well as being open all year around, the gun range also hosts a biannual gun show in April and October, which is billed as the \\"World's Largest Machine Gun Shoot and Military Gun Show\\". The range also hosts a number of shotgun, handgun, rifle and machine gun competitions in April. The range is a family-owned business, with three generations of the founding Sumner family working there as of April 2013. Both the range and the Sumner family are featured on Guntucky, a reality TV series that debuted on the CMT cable channel on April 21, 2013. Machine gun shoot Held in April and October, \\"The World's Largest Machine Gun Shoot and Military Gun Show\\" is an event that draws machine gun dealers, collectors and enthusiasts from all over the country. The Machine Gun Shoot itself consists of several rounds of firing at a wide variety of appliances, vehicles and pyramids of tires. Participants also have the opportunity to shoot at barrels of fuel with pyrotechnic charges attached, which explode when struck by bullets. The objective for these shooters is to destroy everything down range. The presence of many rare and powerful fully automatic weapons also draws many visitors, with firearms ranging from submachine guns to .50 BMG heavy machine guns and M134 Miniguns. The main event of the Machine Gun Shoot is the \\"Night shoot\\" where, after dark, gasoline-filled metal drums and explosives are set up in and around the targets, and tracer ammunition is used. Although reserving a lane for the machine gun shoot is difficult with a several-years- long waiting list, lane holders usually rent the use of their weapons to spectators for a nominal fee to cover the cost of ammunition and wear and tear on the guns themselves. Firearms dealing The Military Gun Show is also a place for dealers to buy, sell and trade Class III firearms.
