Militant Activity According to Russian law enforcement officials, Shameyev's militant career began in May 2010 when he was involved in a skirmish with local security forces. Traveling in a car with fellow militants, the vehicle exploded and Shameyev lost his right eye but was still able to escape his pursuers; this was seen as an act of God by other militants of the North Caucasus, and Shameyev's profile grew considerably. Following the incident Shameyev took to wearing the eye-patch which would become his trademark. In the summer of 2010 Shameyev was identified as the Emir of the Chegem sector west of Nalchik, but he would then be promoted to Emir of the entire southwestern sector of the Caucasus Emirate's Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay. Known as a \\"brilliant and charismatic orator\\" who had been \\"lionized\\" on North Caucasian jihadist websites, Shameyev and Asker Dzhappuyev - the overall leader of the United Vilayat KBK - were the \\"putative masterminds\\" behind a 12-month killing spree that resulted in the deaths of dozens of police and local government officials in Kabardino-Balkaria, including republican mufti Anas Pshikhachev as well as respected Circassian ethnographer Aslan Tsipinov. Death Shameyev was killed by Russian security forces in the village of Progress, Stavropol Krai on 29 April 2011. It has been speculated that the 7 April 2011 capture of two of the United Vilayat's support personnel in Progress may have led to the intelligence that revealed Shameyev's safehouse and resulted in his death just weeks later. Two women and seven other militants also died in the gun battle, including Dzhappuyev (also known as Emir Abdullakh), Emir of the KBK Northeastern sector Kazbek Tashu (Abdul Jabbar), Aslanbek Khamurzov (Abdul Ghafoor), Deputy Emir Abdul Jabaar, Tamerlan Dyeshkov, Albek Kokarev, and Zalim Kunov.

It forms a shrub in open areas of wet forests in the west and northeast of the state. It is occasionally confused with P. gunnii though it has larger flowers and longer, straighter leaves. Description Persoonia muelleri grows as a shrub or small tree generally from tall, though sometimes plants reach high. Bark on larger branches and trunk is dark brown and flaky. It has narrow leaves measuring long and wide. New growth is covered in fine grey to tawny hair. The small flowers are yellow to cream. Var. muelleri flowers from December to February and var. densifolia from January to March. Taxonomy The French botanist Paul √âvariste Parmentier described this species as Drimys muelleri, placing it in the family Winteraceae, in 1896. Ferdinand von Mueller had sent him leaves and stems without any flowering parts, from which Parmentier had concluded it lay within the genus Drimys, though was not like any existing species. The specimen lay unnoticed until Jim Willis concluded it was Persoonia gunnii. It was given its current name and reclassified in the genus Persoonia by botanist Tony Orchard in 1984. The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the Flora of Australia treatment in 1995, and the three endemic Tasmanian species P. muelleri, P. gunnii and P. moscalii are classified in the gunnii group. There are 3 known subspecies of P. muelleri, which have been also relegated to the rank of variety. Subspecies muelleri has hairless oblanceolate leaves and grows in the northeast of the state. Subspecies augustifolia grows in the west of the state on nutrient poor soils and has narrow, hairy linear to oblanceolate leaves. Subspecies densifolia grows along the south coast and offshore islands and has hairy leaves which are broader than the other subspecies. Populations with characteristics intermediate between P. muelleri and P. gunnii are known from Lake Dove‚ÄìCradle Mountain and Adamsons Peak‚ÄìSouth Cape localities. Distribution and habitat P. muelleri var. muelleri is found on the central plateau, including Mount Field, and northeastern highlands of the state. It grows in open forest dominated by Eucalyptus or Nothofagus cunninghamii, often in damp areas and south-facing slopes with mossy ground cover. P. muelleri var. densifolia is found on along the south coast and Bathurst Harbour, as well as on subalpine heathland on Mount Council. It is a component of littoral rainforest and scrub.

Description P. moscalii is a prostrate shrub that spreads to around a metre in diameter, with its main branches growing horizontally before bearing side branches that rise up 4‚Äì5 cm off the ground. The tallest it gets is around 10 cm (4 in). The obovate to spathulate leaves are 6‚Äì15 mm long and 2‚Äì4 mm wide. Their upper surface is flat to concave. Leaves grow upright, with those arising from the underside of horizontal branches bending to grow upwards. The yellow flowers appear in February and March. The shiny dark red-purple fruit are oval, measuring 0.8 cm wide by 1 cm long. Taxonomy Australian botanist Tony Orchard described P. moscalii in 1983, naming it for Tony Moscal, who collected the type specimen on 16 March 1980 and spent many days mapping out its distribution and habits. The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the Flora of Australia treatment in 1995, and the three endemic Tasmanian species P. muelleri, P. gunnii and P. moscalii are classified in the gunnii group.

It is an erect shrub or small tree with egg-shaped or lance-shaped leaves and groups of cylindrical yellow flowers. It usually grows in woodland or forest dominated by jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) or marri (Corymbia calophylla) within of the coast. Description Persoonia elliptica is an erect shrub or small, robust tree, usually with a single trunk growing to a height of . The bark on the trunk is grey and corky. The leaves are arranged alternately and are lance-shaped to egg-shaped but with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide. The leaves are soft and flexible, a similar colour on both surfaces with a prominent midvein on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged in groups of between four and twenty five at the ends of the branches or in leaf axils. Each flower is on the end of a hairy pedicel long. The flower is composed of four glabrous or slightly hairy tepals long, which are fused at the base but with the tips rolled back. The central style is surrounded by four greenish-yellow anthers which are also joined at the base with the tips rolled back, so that it resembles a cross when viewed end- on. Flowering occurs from October to February and is followed by fruit which are smooth green drupes long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Persoonia elliptica was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown from a specimen collected \\"on the side of a rocky hill near Lewin's Land\\" (Cape Leeuwin). The description was published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. German botanist Otto Kuntze proposed the binomial name Linkia elliptica in 1891, from Cavanilles' original description of the genus Linkia but the name was eventually rejected in favour of Persoonia.* The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the Flora of Australia treatment in 1995, and P. elliptica was placed in the Longifolia group. However, he later placed it in the large Lanceolata group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage, based on genetic evidence. Distribution and habitat Snottygobble usually grows as an understorey shrub in forest dominated by jarrah or marri, often with Persoonia longifolia from which it is distinguished by its single trunk, large leaves with a narrow base and compact grey bark.

The film consisted of the rushes (dailies) for a Biblical epic that was a film- within-the-play. Production The Blessed and the Damned premiered in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre Edouard VII and attracted positive notices. Le Monde described it as \\"a stage masterpiece\\"), but the show was a financial flop. Jonathan Rosenbaum speculates its failure was due to the language barrier (the play and film were in English).

Between 1948 and 1952, Welles' cinematic efforts were focussed on his film adaptation of Othello. The Miracle of St. Anne was filmed in the park of Buttes Chaumont, and Welles described the film thus: \\"It's got a lot of distinguished Paris celebrities [in it] ‚Ä¶ It's not supposed to be a very good film ‚Äî it's just rushes. The play begins in a projection room where they're running rushes.\\" The only known copy of the film was owned by Welles, and has long been believed to be lost, although a short clip of the footage is in circulation among private collectors. The second one-act play, Time Runs..., was a retelling of Faust, with Welles as Doctor Faustus and the young Eartha Kitt as Helen of Troy. After the failure of The Blessed and the Damned in Paris, Welles dropped Time Runs... from the show and toured Germany with The Unthinking Lobster, which was performed in Act I, and Act II consisted of numerous scenes and sketches, including a heavily condensed version of The Importance of Being Earnest.

Its rocky, broken terrain is difficult for travelers and snow is possible at any time of the year. The imposing conditions of the mountain and the surrounding plateau preclude nearly all wildlife with the exception of a few nesting Golden Eagles and the occasional mountain goat. Stone cairns stand throughout the area in such numbers that their value as position locators is greatly limited, and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) strongly recommends against using them for navigation. Even modern travellers frequently find themselves lost, and rescue is difficult. The USFS keeps no official records regarding the number of deaths in the area, but the risk of fatalities from accidents and exposure is recognized as high. For even the most experienced outdoor enthusiasts, Froze- to-Death Mountain and the other peaks of the Beartooth Mountain range rank among the most challenging and dangerous of all North American parkland.

He has lived in New York City since 1977. He played mainstream jazz, but later broadened his jazz guitar style without sticking strictly to jazz.  Biography  Ito was born in Oiso, Kanagawa, Japan. 1-1. Early Age / 1971 While a young boy, he was interested in American pop songs, so his father bought him a guitar and gave him lessons. Shinobu devoted great efforts to his study of the guitar and eventually developed an ambition to become a noted guitaristin the future. In junior high school, he organized his own pop music group and performed at various musical events. He became interested in jazz guitar during his high school days when he listened Wes Montgomery. While attending Tokai University, Shinobu studied with the respected guitar teacher, Ikuo Shiosaki, and became a member of the university‚Äôs Tokai University Jazz Workshop. 1-2. Professional career in Japan / 1971-1977 He also began his professional career at this time, performing at clubs and on recordings. In 1975, Shinobu experienced a great culture shock socially and musically during a 6-month stay in Los Angeles. During this period in L.A. Shinobu met Toshiko Akiyoshi, who introduced him to many musicians and strongly suggested to him that he go to New York to learn and play jazz on his next visit to the States. When he returned to Japan in 1975, Shinobu joined vocalist Yoshiko Kimura's group, and also resumed activities with top Japanese musicians such as Kohsuke Mine, Seiichi Nakamura, Shigeharu Mukai, Hidefumi Toki and Takao Uematsu. He also had opportunities to play with Tete Montliu, Bill Reichenbach, Ronnie Foster, Stanley Banks in this era. Also in 1975, he was chosen as one of the 20 popular guitarist in Japan by Swing Journal magazine. In keeping with his plan, Shinobu returned to the United States in 1977 and settled in New York City. 1-3. New York / 1977-2006 He became a member of a 10-piece band directed by Reggie Workman, which performed mainly at Brooklyn festivals. He also joined Teruo Nakamura & his Rising Sun Band and became involved in various other musical activities mostly in the New York area. Additionally, Shinobu appeared on renowned Japanese pianist Tsuyoshi Yamamoto's album in 1981. Some of the many musicians he played with at this time include Joe Jones Jr., Sadik Hakim, John Orr, Tommy Turrentine, Bob Mintzer, Rickey Ford and Kenny Kirkland, among others. In 1982, he formed and recorded his own first fusion group with T.M.Stenens, Kyle Hicks and Gene Williams while continuing straight ahead jazz activities. He would occasioally lead groups at jazz clubs such as the Blue Note, 55 Bar, the Angry Squire, Pat‚Äôs and grabbed many great opportunities to play with some great musicians including Valery Ponomarev, Lonnie Plaxico, Eddie Henderson, Lonnie Smith, Jesse Davis, Kenny Davis and Jeff Williams, among others. In 1989, Shinobu recorded with pianist Kris Defoort's 10-piece group which included Mike Formanek, Vincent Herring and Judy Niemack. Shinobu released his first CD in 1991 with Tom Harrell, Danny Gottlieb, Gary King, Mark Soskin and Dick Oates. So he did a promotional tour to Japan in 1991. Ito had made his album debut as a fusion player, and the session at legendary Roppongi Pit-Inn included old friends Ken Shima on piano, Hidefumi Toki on alto sax and Kenji Takamizu on electric bass. However, what I heard on the live session recording were not the songs I remember from my youth. Apart from ‚ÄúS.O.S.‚Äù by Wes Montgomery, all songs were originals by Shinobu Ito, and all had very beautiful melodies. In 1995, Shinobu subsequently joined tenor saxophonist Eric Wyatt‚Äôs group and produced his debut CD in 1997. So he has played with countless musicians who are also based mostly in Brooklyn, such as Antonio Hart, Mark Shim, Alvester Garnett, Rodney Green, Lester Bowie, Kenyatta Beasley, Tim Perryman and others. Shinobu also performed at the Montreal Jazz Festival with renowned guitarist Ryo Kawasaki.  New Musical Direction & Beyond / 2006-present At a same time, he took a direction not quite possible for a guitarist in jazz scene ‚Äì he felt he needed to question himself on what musical direction he should be taking. As a guitarist, he reached out toward the musical treasure chest of Spain, and of Latin America, and listened broadly and deeply for sources of inspiration. Traditional music for guitar draws heavily upon tango, choro and flamenco, and Ito found inspiration in the works of Enrique Granados and Isaac Alb√©niz, along with contemporary Latin American composers Antonio Lauro and Manuel Ponce. As well, he began listening intently to the works of Heitor Villa-Lobos, who could be called the ‚ÄòBach of Brazil. These styles of music were mostly composed originally for the guitar, while even orchestral works as well as piano pieces were arranged for the guitar, all of them made up the core repertory for classical guitar. ‚ÄúWhen these types of music are played with improvisation, they organically link with jazz, which enables the creation of a new kind of music, does it not?‚Äù wonders Ito. Fortunately, there are many of Latin guitarists in New York, who all exchange ideas with each other. The construction and modes of expression in these styles of playing and phrasing can be closely studied. Moreover, the beautiful melodies and active rhythms can be further brought to life within the context of the jazz groove. One very significant influence on Shinobu Ito has been that of Baden Powell(1937‚Äì2000), the Brazilian-born guitar genius who developed the primitive percussive style of guitar known as Afro Samba and used it for jazz improvisation. It was this inspiration that led Ito to release the album to tribute to Baden Powell and Antonio Lauro in 2002. While Ito was criticized for nylon strings on a Spanish guitar performance, it marked his decision to take a new direction. While Shinobu is known as a jazz guitarist who plays with a pick, in this new direction he plays only with his fingers, as do classical guitar players. Moreover, he improvises on these tunes, effectively fusing classical guitar and jazz. In a Harlem jazz club, Shinobu played blues on a full-size archtop guitar, and was said to create exactly the same groove that first-rate American blues musicians would. However, when he played hard bop, he was admired for being top level in Japan. However, Shinobu would not settle for that, and without sticking strictly to jazz, he sought out to broaden his sense of expression on the guitar. Classical guitar genius Kazuhito Yamashita is also someone of interest to Shinobu. From this influence he got to know a guitar solo CD called Bolero, containing famous orchestral composition by Ravel, played by Larry Coryell, considered a young revolutionary for his fusion of rock and jazz in the 60s. Finding Yamashita interesting as a classical guitarist, Coryell engendered a new era, and this spirit of adventure overlapped with the bold decision taken by Shinobu to improvise on classical guitar pieces. When executive jazz producer Yoichi Nakao first heard of Ito‚Äôs idea to make an album of classical repertoire rendered with improvisation, he was quickly reminded of what Larry Coryell approached many years ago. As a jazz guitarist who dares create a new approach, Ito has released a second Spanish guitar album that truly captures this stance of adventure. The album fully captures this feeling. Shinobu Ito has worked as an instructor in the Jazz Division of the Senzoku College of Music in Tokyo between year 2005-2007, and moves between Tokyo and New York to attend to various projects. He has returned to New York City finally in March 2009 and resuming activities again. Shinobu Ito is a mature musician who still is willing to take on a challenge and explore new directions.

During the reigns of the last two monarchs before the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, King Alfonso XII and King Alfonso XIII, being symbolically considered as \\"relatives\\" to the King, they were always close to his chamber in all kinds of ceremonies and stayed with him inside and outside of the Palace, having lunch daily with him and being also with him at public spectacles such as the bullfights, the theatre, etc.. They exercised their functions by strict daily shifts. Nevertheless, they were not employees of the Royal Household like the Mayordomos de semana and did not receive a regular salary for their service. From the ceremonial point of view - in royal baptisms - seven of them were entrusted to deliver the sacred ornaments for the sacrament (saltcellar, water-jug, cottons, brush etc.).

In official banquets and in the annual opening of the Cortes Generales (Spanish Parliament), the Gentilhombre Grande de Espa√±a in service were always behind the King. With their status, they had free entrance to the Royal Palace of Madrid up to the Chamber after the Saleta and the Antechamber. To be nominated for this class it was necessary not only belonging to the nobility but also being a Grandee of Spain and they had to be previously presented to the King in the so-called ceremony of the Cobertura (Coverage). Their badge was a golden gilded key on a red velvet ribbon with golden bangs and the Royal Cypher of the King who nominated them embroidered also in gold.

The members of this class neither had specific functions inside the ceremonial scheme of the Court, nor exercised active service with a few exceptions, being their appointment a sign of the royal appreciation. This way, prominent men were nominated during the reign of the last King before the Second Spanish Republic, Alfonso XIII. As said very few of them had specific functions at the service to the King and very few of them belonged to the nobility. In fact, at the moment of the suppression of this Office, they remained 520 ‚ÄúGentilhombres de c√°mara con ejercicio y servidumbre‚Äù. Among them, only 155 belonged to the titled nobility. This Court class was just behind the category of ‚ÄúGentilhombres Grandes de Espa√±a con ejercicio y servidumbre‚Äù. Their badge was a golden gilded key with bangs equally of gold. The key was placed horizontally in the waist to the right side in uniforms, dress-coat or frock coat.

(31 December 1731 ‚Äì 28 December 1809) was an English landowner and Member of Parliament for 56 years becoming Father of the House and a prominent member of the Bullock family.Bullock, Llewellyn C W, Memoirs of the Bullock Family, A J Lawrence 1905 Faulkbourne Hall - seat of the Bullock family Early years John Bullock was born in 1731, the eldest surviving son of Josiah Bullock J.P. D.L. of Faulkbourne and Mincing Lane, London and Hannah Cooke, youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Cooke, Member of Parliament for Colchester and governor of East India Company. He was educated as a fellow commoner at Clare Hall, Cambridge and at Lincoln's Inn (1750). He succeeded to Faulkbourne Hall on the death of his father in 1752. Political career At the age of 23, he embarked on a parliamentary career that lasted 56 years and culminated in him becoming father of the house until his death. His period in the house spanned the Seven Years‚Äô War, the War of American Independence, the French Revolution and the earlier Napoleonic Wars. He sat as a fellow member with the Pitts, Burke, Fox and Sheridan. He commenced his parliamentary career in 1754 as member for Maldon; he was returned twice more for the borough in 1761 and in 1768 (polling 443 votes against the 455 of John Huske and the 328 of Jon Hennker). In 1774, he temporarily abandoned his parliamentary career for reasons of cost and it was not until 1780 that he returned to the house. He was returned as member for Steyning in Sussex in 1780, which returned two members until the Reform Bill of 1832. Steyning began returning two Members of Parliament from 1278 and as a rotten borough made up of a depopulated port became similar to Dunwich until the Reform Act 1832. In 1784, he shared the representation of the County of Essex with Thomas Bramston of Screens and sat as Whig Member for the county continuously and without contest for 26 years until his death in 1809. This absence of contest was due a \\"family compact\\", which was the outcome of the ruinous expenses of the two previous elections, by which for more than thirty years one Whig and one Tory were regularly returned. The colonel's second co-member was Admiral Harvey who commanded the ‚ÄúT√©m√©raire‚Äù at Trafalgar. The Colonel is recorded as being a member of Boodle's club in St James's in 1787. Despite the efforts of other parliamentarians, the colonel resisted attempts to make him understand the complexities of foreign affairs and his kinsman, the Duke of Bedford, described him as \\"a good-natured fox- hunting boy\\"; the colonel's grandfather was Edward Bullock MP, of Faulkbourne Hall (1663-1705), whose relative was Elizabeth Howland, Duchess of Bedford, wife of Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford. Colonel Bullock never made a speech in Parliament during his career. The long duration of the \\"compact\\" was due to the high respect in which Colonel Bullock was held throughout the county for his political independence and he was well-liked. At his death, the peaceful state of affairs came to an end.Bullock, Osmund, Faulkbourne and the Bullocks, 2000 Military service He was a colonel in the East Essex Battalion Militia and is recorded at the second in command at the first mustering on 15 November 1759 and at the mustering on 19 April 1778 during the time of the American War of Independence. Faulkbourne Faulkbourne Hall He took a keen interest in Faulkbourne Hall and undertook many improvements to the house and grounds in the 18th century. A drawing shows a Palladianisation of the west front, but the later work seems to have taken it back to - and extended - the gothic original look. He ordered fine tapestries from Aubusson in France and armorial porcelain from China. A patron of the arts, he founded a wide-ranging collection of pictures. In 1803, the house contained many good paintings by van Dyck, Van de Velde, Michelangelo, Sir William Beechey, Sartorius and other masters. Family Elizabeth Bullock (n√©e Lant) Whilst his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Lant) was a considerable heiress to large slum estates in Southwark over 17 acres containing 400 houses, he exhausted a large part of her fortune on Parliamentary life. She died in 1793 and they had no children. He left his estates on his death, in 1809, to his nephew, Jonathan Josiah Christopher Watson, son of his sister, Elizabeth who had married Jonathan Watson JP DL FRS of Ringhall in Suffolk. In 1810, Jonathan Josiah Christopher took the surname Bullock under Royal Sign Manual. The death of the colonel without issue led to the first break in the regular family succession for more than 200 years, since John Bullock of Mulsham founded the Essex Branch of the family. Gainsborough portrait A fine portrait was painted by Gainsborough showing the colonel in full uniform resting his left elbow on a pedestal which supports a classic urn. In his right hand, he holds his laced hat. By his side sits a large Newfoundland dog. In the background are trees and water. The Gainsborough portrait has been at auction several times in the past 25 years: it made ¬£1.2m in 1987, and then ¬£2.65m in 2002, both times setting a world record for Gainsborough. Before the 1987 sale it had been in the same British collection for 90 years - for a long time it was on loan to the government, and hung at 10 Downing St for two years.

It is responsible for law enforcement in unincorporated Boone County, as well as in several municipalities. Several cities including Columbia, as well as the University of Missouri, have their own police departments; however, all departments house prisoners in the Boone County Jail, operated by the BCSD. The current sheriff of Boone County is Dwayne Carey, who has held the position since 2005, and ran unopposed in 2008 and 2012. The BCSD is headquartered in Columbia, which is the county seat and the largest city in Boone County. Sheriff Carey is the 41st sheriff of Boone County. One sheriff, Roger I. Wilson, was killed in the line of duty after confronting robbery suspects (Sheriff Wilson was killed in the same incident that claimed the life of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sergeant Ben Booth). Sheriff Carey is opposed to a current initiative to ban Tasers in Columbia. The initiative was formed after a number of incidents in which Columbia Police officers and BCSD deputies deployed Tasers. The BCSD issues tasers to its officers. Sheriff Carey's issues relate to the fact that his deputies respond to calls in Columbia frequently as well as serving civil paperwork, and that the BCSD headquarters is in Columbia. Sheriff Carey is currently engaged in a difference in opinion with Columbia, Missouri police leaders in how to battle the current spike in crime. According to sheriff Carey, due to the Columbia Police Departments passive response to rising crime, the crime as started to spill into the county. Sheriff Carey has stated in local radio talk shows that his deputies are performing more search warrants in the city of Columbia. Sheriff Carey blames the city leaders, but adds that the beat officers are doing a great job with what resources they are given. Sheriff Carey has stated that proactive patrol and search warrants by his deputies inside the city of Columbia has helped curve the growing crime rates in the city.  Enforcement Division  The Enforcement Division has both uniformed patrol deputies and plain clothes deputies working in the following assigned units: Patrol, Investigation, Traffic, Civil Process, D.A.R.E./SRO, Explorers, and D.O.V.E. The South and North District Commanders oversee the day-to-day operation of Patrol, Investigations, School Resource Officers, Civil Process and the Traffic Unit. In order to better manage operations the South and North District Commanders split supervision duties based on geographic location. The dividing line for this is Interstate 70. Deputies have jurisdiction for the entire county of Boone. This includes any town within Boone County that does not have a police department. Deputies have powers of arrest in all municipalities and townships within Boone County. =Patrol= Boone County consists of 684 square miles. Uniformed Deputies are assigned to a district; there are six districts in Boone County, 3 north of I -70 and 3 south of I-70. Uniformed Deputies enforce and investigate Missouri State Criminal and Traffic laws, answer calls for service and patrol Boone County roads. Deputies serve arrest and search warrants, orders of protection, probate orders, subpoenas and civil summonses. Deputies are armed with Glock 22 .40 caliber sidearms.  K9  The department began the K9 program in March 1993 with the selection of the first handler. The Boone County K9 Unit currently consists of two handler/dog teams. Both of dogs are German Shepherds, originally from the Czech Republic. The handlers trained their K9 partners as dual purpose dogs in a strenuous 8 week K9 handler course. Dual purpose K9s are trained in both drug detection and patrol, which consists of tracking, building search, area search, physical apprehension, and handler protection. Each dog team is annually certified through the Missouri Police Canine Association. Additionally, each team trains weekly to maintain proficiency. The dogs live with their handlers at their homes and work each shift with their handler in a specially equipped police car. The K9 cars and S.U.V's contain a custom dog kennel, water bowl, fan, temperature monitor and a remote door opener. The K9 teams have tracked (and located) missing persons, apprehended dangerous suspects, and been responsible for the removal of a significant amount of illegal drugs and weapons from the community. The K9 Unit routinely assists other law enforcement agencies in Mid-Missouri.  Swat  The primary responsibility of the Boone County Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT) is to successfully resolve difficult police situations, which are beyond the ordinary capabilities of enforcement personnel, through the use of specialized tactics, skills, and equipment. The Boone County Sheriff's Department formally created the Boone County Emergency Response Team (BCERT) in the early spring of 1996. The team was created to address the need for personnel with training in the tactics and with the special equipment necessary to resolve situations that are beyond the normal capacity of enforcement deputies. The first activation of the team occurred less than a week later to search for a suspect who fled Detectives in the Easley area. Narcotics Detectives were on a three- day surveillance of a marijuana patch when the suspect arrived, and then fled when an arrest was attempted. In 2007, in keeping with a national trend to distinguish between community response teams utilizing acronyms such as CERT, the Boone County Emergency Response Team was renamed to the Boone County Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team. Boone County SWAT is closely associated with other tactical teams in the Central Missouri area and has strong ties to both the Central Missouri Tactical Officer's Association and the Kansas City Metro Tactical Officer's Association. = Investigative Unit = The Boone County Sheriff's Department Investigative Unit is divided into two separate units with each being supervised by a Detective Sergeant. Unit one consists of a sergeant and 6 detectives. The detectives investigate crimes against persons such as homicide and death investigations, robbery, sexual assaults ‚Äì adult & juvenile, incidents of domestic violence, and child abuse. The Investigative Unit is also responsible for working property crimes such as burglary, stealing, auto theft, arson, fraud, forgery, and identity theft. Although there are no specialty positions within this Unit, cases are distributed to the Detectives based on specialized training and experience. All sex offender registrations, warrants, and violations are the responsibility of the Investigative Unit. Detectives are on-call 24 hours a day and are expected to respond to all major incidents. Detectives are also trained as crime scene investigators. Unit two consists of a sergeant and 6 detectives investigating drug crimes, internet crimes against children and a uniformed pro active patrol unit. The Mid-Missouri Internet Crimes Task Force is a task force facilitated and managed by the Boone County Sheriff's Department. The Mid-Missouri Internet Crimes Task Force is a joint cooperative effort formalizing relationships between and among the participating agencies in order to foster an efficient and cohesive unit capable of addressing the problem of crimes committed through the use of computers and the Internet within the Mid-Missouri area. These investigations include but are not limited to Internet enticement of children, child pornography, trafficking of children, trafficking of illegal narcotics to children, harassment, cyber bullying, terrorist threats, and other crimes facilitated through the use of computers, the Internet, or other electronic media and the forensic examination of computers and other electronic media used to facilitate criminal activity. It is the desire of the participating agencies to achieve maximum inter-agency cooperation in a combined law enforcement effort aimed at reducing criminal activity perpetrated though the use of computers, the Internet, and other electronic media within the communities it serves. =Traffic Unit= The Traffic Unit was started in the early 1990s. At that time the unit consisted of one deputy. In October 2005 the Traffic Unit was expanded to 3 deputies due to grant funding from the Missouri Department of Transportation Division of Highway Safety. Today the traffic unit consists of 3 deputies and a sergeant. The Traffic Unit is responsible for investigating crashes on county maintained roadways, traffic enforcement, providing educational programs for the public, providing traffic related training to the department on various traffic related topics, and planning and implementation of various special traffic enforcement events.  Corrections  The Boone County Jail was opened on February 28, 1991. The original jail/Sheriff's Operations Building complex, existed of four buildings with a Vehicular Sally Port. The entire project comprised approximately 54,000 square feet at an initial cost of about 6.8 million dollars. The jail occupies three and one half buildings and approximately 35,000 square feet of space. The remaining 19,000 square feet of program space is devoted to joint mechanical space and the Sheriff‚Äôs Operations. This new jail is an \\"indirect supervision\\" model which allows for viewing into the cell blocks by way of windows and camera monitoring by control room officers as well as roving officers that enter in the cell blocks and housing units on a frequent basis. Each of the three offender housing structures includes a central control room surrounded by 5 to 7 housing cell blocks. Each cell block holds from six to twenty four inmates of various gender and offense classification. The original jail had 134 beds for custodial inmates and a 50-bed Work Release center split with 35 beds for men and 15 beds for women offenders. In 1999, the sheriff's department divested the Work Release program and contracted with Reality House Incorporated to manage that function. The sheriff's department conducted a major renovation of the work release facility and created a five unit classification custody area primarily for female offenders. With the addition of add-on bunk space and absorption of program space it added 26 additional beds in the original custody buildings and increased the total inmate capacity from 134 to 210 inmates. All this was done within the existing hardened environment of the original 1991 construction. As a result of the total use of existing hardened space the sheriff's department was forced to add a small storage building accessible to the admin building. Although the total maximum capacity is 210, due to classification and gender needs, it operates in the 182-185 capacity as a daily operational capacity. Inmates that exceed the operating capacity are housed frequently at Reality House Inc., Cooper County, Chariton County, Howard County, Callaway County, and Randolph County.

Purpose of the Act  According to its long title, the purpose of the Islington Church Act of 1750 (\\"the 1750 Act\\") was to enable the Parishioners of the Parish of Saint Mary, Islington, in the County of Middlesex, to rebuild the Church of the said Parish. The church of St Mary the Virgin is situated in Upper Street, Islington. A church has stood on this site since the twelfth century. The original church was re-built in 1483, 1754 and finally in 1956. The preamble to the 1750 Act recorded that the whole of the church \\"is now in a very ruinous Condition\\". Provisions The 1750 Act provided as follows- * (a) authorised the Trustees appointed under the Act to pull down the old church and steeple and re-build the same * (b) fees charged for funerals, bell- ringing and the use of palls at funerals were to be used for the re-building works * (c) appointment of Trustees to carry out this Act; Trustees authorised to levy and enforce payment of the rates and duties authorised by this Act * (d) appointment of collectors and receivers of the rates and duties to be raised under this Act; duties of collectors and penalties for default * (e) the Trustees were authorised to raise up to ¬£7000 by selling annuities; annuities to be charged on the rates; assignment of annuities * (f) the Trustees were authorised to levy and collect rates to meet any short fall in the rates and duties chargeable under this Act resulting in insufficient moneys with which to pay the annuities; such rates to be payable by owners and occupiers of parish land; special provisions for properties let out * (g) appointment of replacement trustees; disqualification of Trustees * (h) rates chargeable under this Act to commence on 24 June 1751 and to cease when all the annuities had been paid off * (i) Trustees authorised to sell and dispose of the remains of the old church;temporary tabernacle to be built to serve as a place of worship during the church re-building * (j) Trustees required to keep records of all payments and receipts and to make such records available for inspection * (k) Act not to affect private graves, gravestones or vaults, or the rights of the vicar and his successors in relation to the chancel of the old or the new church * (l) civil procedure issues and status of this Act. Repeal In 2011, The Law Commission consulted on its proposal to repeal the Act, stating that, \\"The 1750 Act no longer serves any useful purpose. It was passed to facilitate the re-building of St Mary‚Äôs Church, Islington. That objective was achieved in 1754 when the building works were completed and the new church was opened. The provisions in the Act for raising local rates ended when the final annuity secured by the rates had come to an end. That would have been no later than 1790 or thereabouts. The 1750 Act is accordingly obsolete and its repeal is proposed on that basis.\\" References Category:Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1750 Category:Middlesex ","title":"Islington Church Act 1750"},{"id":"33728323","text":"The R600 road is a regional road in County Cork in Ireland.

Von Stolz attended the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna and made her debut at the local Kammerspielen. She subsequently performed at various theaters in Vienna and in the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin. She made her debut in film in 1928 under the pseudonym \\"Helen Steels\\". That same year, she moved to Berlin. In her second film role, she played the lead role opposite Reinhold Sch√ºnzel in Don Juan in a Girls' School. Von Stolz began performing under her real name starting in 1933. She established herself as a major film actress although she had to be satisfied with major supporting roles that usually portrayed elegant ladies and femmes fatales such as the actress Lydia Link in The Dreamer. Von Stolz had planned to emigrate from Germany but the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 frustrated those plans. During the war she worked in a number of Nazi propaganda films, the most widely known of these was her role as the wife of Duke Karl Alexander in Veit Harlan's Jud S√º√ü (1940).http://www.tilsiter- lichtspiele.de/programm/2011/veranstaltungen/veit_harlan_filme.pdf After the war, she acted only rarely in films.

In 2011, Black was nominated for the Turner Prize and also represented Scotland at the Venice Biennale. Black's work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at a number of international venues such as Modern Art Oxford and Kunsthalle Nurnberg, Germany. Black is represented by Stuart Shave/Modern Art, London and Galleria Raffaella Cortese, Milan, Italy.  Early life and education  Black was born 1972 in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire and studied Sculpture at The Glasgow School of Art from 1995 to 1999. From there, Black gained an MPhil in Art in Organisational Contexts from the year 1999 to 2000, as well as an MFA in fine arts from 2002 to 2004.  Artistic style  Black uses mostly traditional art-making materials such as plaster, paint, paper and chalk in her work, along with a small amount of substances such as cosmetics and toiletries. Her sculptures are either 'almost' or 'only just' objects and skirt the mediums of sculpture, painting, performance art and installation, often juxtaposing large scale with a fragility of form. Black utilises and plays with the physical properties of a wide array of materials, which she seeks to use in an aesthetically pleasing, yet raw and unformed way. Although Black identifies as a sculptor, her use of everyday matter mixed with traditional art materials works to expand the parameters of sculpture. According to Black, her works exists and operates as \\"almost painting, almost installation, almost performance art.\\" Artists who have influenced her work include Helen Frankenthaler, Karen Kilimnick, Lynda Benglis, Robert Smithson and Richard Tuttle. Black cites the influence of psychoanalytical theory on her work: she has a particular interest in the writings of Melanie Klein (1882‚Äì1960) who pioneered early developments in child psychology. Black has said: \\"The sculptures are rooted in Psychoanalysis and Feminism; in theories about the violent and sexual underpinnings of both individual mental mess, as in neuroses and psychosis, and the formlessness of specific points in art history, i.e. German and Abstract Expressionism, Viennese Actionism, Land Art, Anti-form and Feminist Performance.\\" In one of Black's pieces entitled \\"Made to Wait\\" (2009), a cellophane sheet is seen floating as an invisible screen with a band of paint and other cosmetic products are smeared over it, covering its lower half. According to the Guggenheim, this piece is \\"elusive and stable\\" while \\"the work is grounded in its materiality as a physical experience and resists any metaphorical or symbolic meaning.\\" Exhibitions Karla Black's artwork has been in solo exhibitions at institutions such as the Kestnergesellschaft in Hanover, Germany; the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia; the Gemeentemuseum, The Hague; the Dallas Museum of Art; and the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow. Black represented Scotland at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011. =Selected Solo Exhibitions= 2021 * Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh (forthcoming) 2020 * \\"Karla Black: 20 Years\\", Des Moines Art Centre, Des Moines, IA, USA 2019 * Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt * Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne, Germany 2018 * The Power Plant, Toronto, Canada * Capitain Petzel, Berlin, Germany 2017 * Modern Art, London * Le Festival d‚ÄôAutomne √† Paris, Palais des Beaux-Arts / Mus√©e des Archives Nationales, Paris, France * Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens, Deurle, Belgium 2016 * \\"Principles of Admitting\\", Migros Museum f√ºr Gegenwartskunst, Z√ºrich, Switzerland *Galleria Raffaella Cortese, Milan, Italy * David Zwirner, New York, NY, USA * Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne, Germany 2015 * Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA), Dublin, Ireland 2014 * Modern Art, London *Galleria Raffaella Cortese, Milan, Italy *David Zwirner, New York, NY, USA 2013 * Kestnergesellschaft, Hanover, Germany * Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, PA, USA Gemeente Museum, The Hague, Netherlands * Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne, Germany 2012 * Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, TX, USA * Modern Art, London * Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow * Schinkel Pavillon, Berlin, Germany 2011 * \\"Karla Black\\", Scotland and Venice, 54th International Art Exhibition ‚Äì La Biennale di Venezia, Venice, Italy 2010 * Capitain Petzel, Berlin, Germany * Wittman Collection, Ingolstadt, Germany * \\"Ten Sculptures\\", Kunsthalle N√ºrnberg, Nuremberg, Germany 2009 * \\"Karla Black: Sculptures with paintings by Bet Low\\" (1924-2007), Inverleith House, Edinburgh * Modern Art Oxford, Oxford * Kunstverein Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany * Migros Museum f√ºr Gegenwartskunst, Z√ºrich, Switzerland * Mary Mary, Glasgow 2008 * \\"Champagne Perrier-Jou√´t Prize (Winner 2007)\\", Zoo Art Fair, London * \\"Catch This: New Works from the Arts Council Collection\\", Longside Gallery, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield * West London Projects, London * Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne, Germany 2007 * IBID Projects, London 2006 * Galerie Sandra Buergel, Berlin, Germany * Mary Mary, Glasgow * Outpost, Norwich * \\"Have Him Be Her\\", Broadway 1602, New York, NY, USA 2004 * Mary Mary, Glasgow 2002 * Robert, Glasgow Project Room, Glasgow Selected Collections *Arts Council Collection, London *Centre Pompidou, Paris, France *Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, TX, USA *David Roberts Art Foundation, London *EVN Collection, Maria Enzersdorf, Austria *Gemeente Museum Den Haag, The Hague, Netherlands *Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Lafayette Anticipations, Paris, France *Migros Museum f√ºr Gegenwartskunst, Z√ºrich, Switzerland *RISD Museum, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, RI, USA Saatchi Gallery, London *Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh *Solomon R.

It was built during 1844. It is also known as Susannah Place Museum. The property is owned by Property NSW and managed by Sydney Living Museums, agencies of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 December 1999. Susannah Place had domestic occupants until 1990 and the former cottages and store serve as an evolution of Western occupation over 160 years, especially the urban working class community.  History  The early site ownership is confused by a convoluted set of claims and counter claims from the 1830s tracing back to 1816 and two men; William Walsh and Dennis Conway, each of whom owned a building on the site. In 1815 Walsh acquired a publican's license and the Memorials allude to an inn called The Duke Wellington on the site. Not long after, Walsh succeeded in securing an indenture in which Dennis Conway \\"did assign bargain transfer and make over to the said William Walsh...all that dwelling house situate lying and being No. 6 Gloucester Street, Sydney\\". In May 1834, long after the death of both men, Conway's grandson, John Norman, disputed William Walsh Junior's ownership of the site. After obtaining evidence from witnesses about the event of 15 years earlier, the Commissioner for Claims found in favour of Norman. After the claim had been settled, the site was purchased by Walsh Jnr's widow, Harriet Walsh, however, by December 1835, the Sheriff forced her to sell her property due to financial difficulties. The purchaser was ex-convict James Byrne who acquired the land and buildings for . A map of Section 76 by Robert Russell dated 3 January 1838 indicates the presence of two structures on the site. The larger of the two structures occupies the northern section of the site. The building is constructed to the Gloucester Street boundary and to the slightly kinked northern site boundary. Annotations on the plan note \\"James Byrne, claimant Harriet Walsh\\". Details on a map held at the Land Titles Office also confirms Harriet Walsh's claim to this land located in City Section 76. Both Byrne and Walsh owned land on the other side of Gloucester Street. Byrne, a licensed victualler, died in 1838 and left all his property to his wife. In 1842 Sarah Byrne was forced to sell most of the land she inherited including St Patrick's Inn and the Gloucester Street site by public auction. In July of the same year Edward Riley purchased land in The Rocks that one source notes included a \\"six-room cottage with a yard\\" for . Another source notes that Susannah Place replaced a semi-detached pair of single storey cottages constructed in the rock ledge above Cambridge Street. However, by 1844 the building(s) had been demolished and four houses constructed. The 1845 City Council Rate Assessment Book notes the new buildings \\"with basement kitchens\\" owned by Edward Reilly (sic) and occupied by John Munro (shop), Thomas Hall, Francis Cunningham and James Macknell. It is not clear who the actual builder of the terrace was, although it is thought to have been Riley; he owned the building when it was completed and tenanted but when he acquired the land is unknown. Edward Riley and his wife Mary were assisted immigrants who arrived in Sydney in 1838. They were accompanied by their nineteen year old niece, Susannah Sterne (also referred to as Susannah Stere or Sterne). The shipping list described Edward as a thirty year old farmer from Wexford and his wife, aged thirty-one, as a nursery governess. Their niece was described as a milliner from County Carlow. All three were sponsored by Mr John Marshall, who also sponsored most of the other 245 passengers aboard HMS Amelia Thompson. Little is known about the family's life in the colony. Edward Riley's transition from assisted immigrant to owner of four houses in six years and in a depressed economy is intriguing. Edward Riley died in 1853 and Mary became the owner of the terraces. As owner and occupant of the place for nearly thirty years, Mary would have provided a constant and stable presence, contrary to the absentee landlords, common in The Rocks during this period. Tenants in the other houses left and returned regularly in the period up until 1874. Apparently people who lived elsewhere in the street moved in when there was a vacancy. It is thought that Susannah Place was connected to the water supply and sewer during Mary Riley's ownership. On her death Mary Riley left the shop and adjacent terrace to her \\"grand-daughter\\" Mary Ann Hensley and the other two houses to the Anglican Church. Mary Ann was in fact the daughter of Mary's niece, Susannah. Mary Ann married John Finnegan In October 1874 and the Finnegan's ran the grocers shop between 1876 and 1877. By 1886 they had moved to Granville. All four houses were then tenanted. Susannah Place did not change hands again until after it was resumed by the government under the Darling Harbour Wharves Resumption Act in 1900, after the outbreak of plague. The resumption does not appear to have altered the tenancy pattern. Cumberland Street and Gloucester Street were realigned during the early 1900s and the level of Gloucester Street was raised. This resulted in changes to Cumberland Place, and Cambridge Street virtually disappearing. The rear yards of numbers 58-62 were extended across what had been that street. Around 1911 and 1912 terraces were built around Susannah Place and the Australian Hotel was rebuilt on the corner of Cumberland Place and Cumberland Street. In the 1930s the Maritime Services Board became the landlords for the area. Again there appears to have been no change in the tenancy pattern. When the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) took control of the property only three of the four residences were occupied. All the residents received notification that their houses would be affected by the Authority's redevelopment scheme in November 1971 and that they would be relocated to neighbouring Housing Commission developments or other properties under the Authority's control. One family, the Andersens at No 58, remained until 1974, Mr R. W. Smith who had been at number 64 since 1955 stayed until 1976. The Marshalls in number 62 remained at Susannah Place until 1990 and took on the role of unofficial caretakers. Agreement between the Rocks Resident Action Group and the Builders' Labourers Federation saw the imposition of a \\"Green Ban\\" on the area - the third in Sydney, but the first in a working class neighbourhood and the first with the State government as opponent. In January 1978 the SCRA received a quote to demolish Susannah Place as it was one of a group of buildings to be demolished having been perceived as being at the end of their \\"economic lives and standing on sites required for redevelopment\\". In 1986 the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales became interested in Susannah Place and the NSW Premier, Neville Wran reaffirmed that the Trust should acquire the property as a matter of \\"critical significance to the State's heritage\\". Negotiations began to lease the property as the freehold could not be transferred. Conservation work began on the site in 1987 as a joint project between the SCRA and the Trust. In 1988 the SCRA became the Sydney Cove Authority, signifying shifts away from the push towards maximum redevelopment of The Rocks, although not a halt to development. The Clock Tower development has obliterated the views of the harbour from Susannah Place, an important feature of the property. Major conservation and repair works carried out by SCA in 1992. When restoration works commenced, the primary tasks involved the stabilisation of the plasterwork, repair of leaking parapets and guttering, the removal and replacement of white ant infested timber and the upgrading of the drainage services. Restoration works were completed in 1992 at a total cost of $250,000. Susannah Place was then handed over to the Historic Houses Trust of NSW, who undertook an interpretive fitout and opened it as a house museum. The museum included the recreation of the corner shop to the 1910-1920s. A new project to recreate the Hughes family's 1919 era bedroom at Susannah Place is part of Sydney Living Museums' ongoing interpretation strategy to tell real stories of the houses and their occupants while maintaining the integrity of the buildings' surviving fabric.Cossu, 2016, 17. = Archaeological History = Granted as Lot 1, Section 76 of 10 perches to James Byrne. Susannah Place is a row of four terrace houses, one also serving as a shop, constructed in 1844. Harpers map of 1823 indicates structures here by that date although their history has not been fully researched. The conservation works were part of a stabilisation program whereby the terrace was handed over to the Historic Houses Trust for use as a house-museum. The terrace has been interpreted as an archaeological resource in itself, revealing to visitors the changes that have occurred to its fabric over its lifetime.  Description  Susannah Place terrace houses as viewed from Gloucester Street in 2019. The shop is the terrace on the right. Susannah Place is a small early Victorian Georgian terrace row of four dwellings which includes a former corner shop. It is bounded on the north by a row of terraces built In 1912, on the west by Gloucester Street, on the east by Cambridge Street and on the south by Cumberland Place. The present level of Gloucester Street is four steps higher than the area immediately in front of Susannah Place and the ground floor level in the houses is another step below this. Susannah Place ‚Äòis very similar to a class of London houses that featured simple pattern of openings and detailing.‚Äô It is made up of four multi-level terraces, with a two-storey fa√ßade facing onto Gloucester Street and a three-storey fa√ßade facing onto Cambridge Street and Cumberland Place. The building is on a sandstone foundation, with external brick walls in colonial bond and internal walls brick nogged. The roof line is hidden by a sandstone-capped parapet, in the fashion of the day. There is an inscription on the Gloucester Street (western) elevation which reads \\"Susannah Place Anno Domini 1844\\". Each house was originally built with six rooms over three levels, with the kitchen in the basement and external outhouses. Originally, the rooms of the first floor were the bedrooms, whilst the rooms on the ground floor were used as parlours and dining rooms. Currently, the majority of rooms have been retained to certain eras, based on the information and history known about the families and also the surviving details. The houses are a source of the changes of technology in the area, as seen by the ‚Äòshift from dependence for water upon community pumps in the streets to piped water; and from the used of oil, candles, wood and coal to gas and electricity for light, cooking and heating.‚Äô Susannah Place is built of colonial bond brickwork on a rock-faced sandstone site. The basements are cut into the bedrock of the sloping site, The brickwork to the Cumberland Place elevation and the splay to the south western corner have been rendered. However, there is evidence of painted shop signs below the base coat of render. All other brickwork is face brickwork and painted. Window sills, parapet copings and upstands are of dressed sandstone. The main internal traverse walls are brick nogged; subsidiary walls are boarded with wider cedar lining boards of irregular widths. Susannah Place is irregularly shaped with a kink at the junction of numbers 58 and 60. The northern wall is angled. The building is simply proportioned. The doors to Gloucester Street are six- panelled while the internal doors and external doors to the rear are ledged and sheeted. The original shingle roof was replaced with corrugated iron in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century. Timber ground floor additions at the back are of Oregon, Baltic Pine and Redwood.Moore 1989: 1 & 16 = Condition = As at 11 March 2009, the property was decayed but stabilised. The finishes and fabric are largely intact. Archaeology is partly disturbed. Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Terraced into hill slope. Archaeological excavation in 1992 concentrated mainly on No 60, consisting of small trenches in the basement, a trench in the rear yard and another at the Gloucester St footpath, all sited according to the schedule of conservation works. In the final stages of conservation works, staff of the Historic Houses Trust removed sub-floor deposits from some areas in the upper floor. It is believed these were later replaced \\"in situ\\". The archaeological investigations have further identified the extent of the resource on the site. Investigation: Conservation Plan, Watching Brief. = Modifications and dates = The following modifications are known to have taken place to the shop and/or cottages:Moore 1989: 13-18 *Running water connected *Connection to sewer line *Timber addition to rear of numbers 62 & 64 *-1900Shingle roofing replaced by corrugated iron *-12Rear yards of numbers 58-62 extended across what had been Cambridge Street *sPartly open laundry and corrugated iron bathroom facilities built *sBasement kitchens in 62 and 64 relocated to timber addition *-1950Chip heaters installed  Conservation as a museum  In 1987, a joint project between the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales and the Sydney Cove Authority was established to conserve the terrace houses. The conservation work focuses on preserving and conserving, rather than recreating, so all restorative work is fully documented and where possible, reversible. The terraces contrast with many other restored houses because it retains old materials rather than recreating them from new ones. Susannah Place aims to ‚Äòpreserve the evidence of the building‚Äôs use and its adaptation to the changing needs of its occupants over 150 years.‚Äô A conservation management plan places exceptional importance on retaining the character of the building, stating the need to ‚Äòretain overall form, scale and character of the exterior and character of the ground, first floor levels‚Äô. One example of creating a museum in the making include leaving the front room on the ground floor of no. 58 ‚Äòas found‚Äô, which hadn‚Äôt been occupied since 1974 and the only changes were essential repairs.  Tenants  The history of Susannah Place‚Äôs occupancy has been put together through oral histories and contextual research. Some of the families and people that lived in each of the four houses are listed below: = No. 58 = Thomas Hughes and his family lived here between 1916 and 1929. Between 1934 and 1974, the house was occupied by John and Adelaide (Ada) Gallagher, then their daughter Mary Anderson with her husband Martin and two sons, the younger son, Ernie, then living in the house until 1974. The house had no more tenants after that. = No. 60 = The first tenants of this house were Ellen and Francis Cunninghame, who arrived in Australia from Glasgow on 8 February 1840 on the ship The Arkwright. Documents from that time indicate that he had been sponsored by A B Smith & Co., and lived here between 1844 to 1845. During this time, Ellen Cunninghame gave birth to two children first a son Francis and then another daughter, Ellen when living in No. 60. In 1848 Francis joined with Edward Hawskley to establish the radical newspaper The People's Advocate and New South Wales Vindicator. The house was then run as a lodging house in 1865 by William Merchant, with most tenants being of maritime occupations due to the close proximity of Susannah Place to the docks. Dorothea, Arthur and Emmanuel Sarantides lived in this house between 1934 and 1946. Evidence of their occupancy is shown through the kitchen on the ground floor, which was recreated based on Dorothea‚Äôs grandchildren‚Äôs recollections of visiting their grandmother after school. = No. 62 = House no. 62 was originally occupied by the builders and owners, Edward and Mary Riley. They arrived as Irish immigrants to the colony with Susannah Sterne who was Mary's daughter by her first marriage in Clonigal, Ireland and whomOriginal the terraces are named after. The property was purchased for 450pounds, a valuable amount, and was an incredible feat for the Rileys after arriving only four years earlier and dealing with the depression of the 1840s. Another tenant of the no. 62 was Ellen and Dennis Marshall, who lived in the house for 28 years between 1962 and 1990. They remained as unofficial caretakers for many years, as the other terraces were no longer occupied, the last tenants of the other houses moving out by 1976. = No. 64 = A small grocer shop selling food and essential household items was included in this house during the construction and is now the entrance to the museum as well as a working shop. The first tenant was James Munro, who was a ginger beer maker and lived there in 1845. Another tenant of the corner shop was George Hill, who moved there in 1879 and fell into debt 8 years later. He remained there until 1898 after reselling his stock and furniture to repay debts. After being sold to Eliza and Robert Sneddon in 1931, the store was run until 1935 when their departure also meant the end of the shop. Later tenants include Mary Carmichael between 1949 and 1954, and the last tenant, Ronald Smith who arrived in 1965 and left in 1972. = Current shop = Through oral histories, a current shop has been established in the 1920s era, modelled after recollections of Jim Young. He was the son of Hugo and Clara Youngein, who were the tenants of the shop between 1904 and 1930.  Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, Susannah Place, Nos. 58-64 Gloucester Street is of State significance for its historic, aesthetic, scientific and social values. The site and buildings are significant for their contribution to the character and qualities of the precinct and are significant for their contribution to The Rocks. Susannah Place is a rare example of a simple working class 1840s terrace in The Rocks and wider area, which has undergone few alterations despite major changes of ownership and social infrastructure since its construction. Susannah Place significantly retains fabric and physical evidence of its continuous occupation since 1844. The buildings were constructed for the rental market, but were also initially owner-occupied for over thirty years which may have also contributed to the good standard of construction and care of the buildings. The survival of the buildings through the cleansing operations of the early 1900s is largely due to its sound construction and adherence to building codes introduced in the late 1830s. Since their construction the buildings have continued to be occupied by a number of tenants under landlords such as the Church of England, Sydney Harbour Trust and Maritime Services Board. The buildings significantly survived the development pressures of the 1970s due to the work of local resident action groups and remaining tenants in the building. As such the buildings have high social value which is enhanced by the extant fabric and archaeological resources found on the site which tell much of the lives of the occupants and development and changes in The Rocks in general. Susannah Place is of historical and technological significance as it demonstrates early 19th century construction techniques and finishes and a vernacular domestic style in the adaption of the standard terrace form and adherence to the building codes of the 1830s. The buildings provide evidence of how the working classes lived from the 1840s and this ongoing use and occupation also provides much research potential. The terraces are prominent elements in the area and make a positive contribution to the Gloucester and Cambridge Street streetscapes and Cumberland Place. Susannah Place was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 December 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Susannah Place is historically significant as a good and largely intact terrace dating from the 1840s that demonstrates the development of a housing form, building and servicing technology of this period. The buildings are historically significant as they have had relatively few alterations in their 160 year history and retain evidence of their ongoing use and occupation. The site of Susannah Place is significant as it demonstrates the changes in town planning in the precinct through the changing street levels in Gloucester Street and changing Gloucester and Cambridge Street alignments. Susannah Place reflects aspects of Australian History with evidence of works undertaken as a result of the outbreak of the plague to realignment of the street frontage in part due to preparation works for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The terraces are representative of relatively simple, speculative developments which were also initially owner-occupied which may attribute to the level of servicing and maintenance of the buildings. They significantly survived the demolitions and cleansing operations that followed the plague of 1900, due to their construction and adherence to building codes of the late 1830s, and more recent redevelopment pressures in the 1970s due to the actions of the local resident action groups and their supporters. Susannah Place as educational value as a resource for the interpretation of the history and development of area and the people who lived here and living standards through the various phases of development. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Susannah Place is associated with a known progression of owners and tenants from the working and lower middle classes with owners ranging from owner-occupiers to the Church of England and a history of public housing under government bodies who administered the buildings. These comprise the Sydney Harbour Trust, Maritime Services Board, Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and Sydney Cove Authority. The buildings are now associated with Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority and Historic Houses Trust of NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Susannah Place is a rare example of a simple terrace that demonstrates early 19th century construction techniques and finishes and a vernacular domestic style in the adaption of the model form of terrace housing to suit the sloping site and incorporation of basement level in lieu of rear service wings and treatment of the rear of the buildings. The use of solid building materials, stone and brick, and incorporation of party walls that extend beyond the roof line that created separation between each of the dwellings also indicates adherence to the newly introduced building codes of the day. The form of the building, lack of garden and incorporation of a corner shop in the building also represents a shift in the style of residential accommodation during this period and change in living standards as the land in the area became more developed and densely populated with locals relying on small stores instead of cottage gardens. The terraces are prominent elements in the Gloucester and Cambridge Street streetscapes primarily due to their modest scale and location on Cumberland Place. They are the only survivors from the early Victorian development of the area and make a positive contribution to varied character and nature of the precinct. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Susannah Place has had continuous life since 1844 as a cluster of working class residences in a closely knit working class neighbourhood within a city area that has undergone periodic physical transformations. It demonstrates the way of life, architecture and attitudes of Its working class occupants dating to the 1840s. Susannah Place is significant for its evidence of, and ability to demonstrate, domestic and family life and the role of The Rocks' urban working class In the 19th and 20th centuries. Susannah Place demonstrates a high standard of pride in its occupants despite being rental accommodation. This significance is enhanced by the number of people who have an intimate knowledge of the property and the way of life played out in it. The social significance of the place is enhanced by the oral histories compiled that indicate that the place has special significance to a number of former residents of the buildings and The Rocks area in general. The Historic Houses Trust has released a book \\"A Place in The Rocks\\" that is specifically about Susannah Place and its inhabitants. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Susannah Place is largely intact as such demonstrates the architecture of the 1840s and domestic standards, spatial requirements and way of life and attitudes of its occupants from this time. The changes to the surrounding area, the front street alignment and rear site boundaries also demonstrate changes in the local urban planning and development of the area. The grounds and environs contain a unique resource for interpretation of these changes. The finishes and fabric of the buildings provide a valuable resource and reference to the type of interior decorations common to working class houses. The buildings have now been interpreted and significantly demonstrate the domestic and local life in the 19th and 20th centuries. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Susannah Place is a rare surviving example of an intact simple terrace which has had few alterations since 1844. There are a number of terraces constructed in the mid to late 19th century remaining in The Rocks area, however, these vary in scale and detail, have undergone alterations and some are now used as commercial premises. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Susannah Place is significant as a row of working class residences dating from the 1840s that demonstrates a continuity of occupation, domestic family and local life, tastes and circumstances over the past 160 years.

It was retired from service at the beginning of the twentieth century and replaced by Maradana Station. The preserved building is now home to the National Railway Museum.  History  Colombo Terminus Station was opened in 1865 to serve all trains at Colombo. In 1906, a project was launched to reorganise the railway within the Colombo area. Colombo Terminus Station was closed and replaced by the new Maradana Station. Today the station is the site of the National Railway Museum.  Features  Terminus Station was originally the end of the Main Line. The construction of the Coast Line towards Slave Island turned the Terminus Station into a quarter-mile-long siding, making operation inconvenient. Instead of a clock, a sundial was originally used to tell the time. This would have avoided the cost of installing a mechanically-operated clock.

It began filming in 1961, but did not air until 1964.Joseph McBride, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A portrait of an independent career (University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 2006) p.123 The series follows Welles' travels around Spain, and was narrated by Arnoldo Fo√†. The series was made for Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI-TV). Co- starring with Welles were his Italian wife Paola Mori, and their young daughter Beatrice Welles. Production and filming At the time, Welles was simultaneously working on his film adaptation of Don Quixote, and the series was primarily made to raise funds for the film. Jonathan Rosenbaum describes the series as \\"a bread-and-butter travelogue made in order to finance work on the Quixote feature.\\"Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Peter Bogdanovich and Orson Welles, This is Orson Welles (Da Capo Press, New York, 1992 [rev. 1998 ed.]) p.508 When Welles's unfinished Don Quixote film was released in a much-derided re-edit by Jes√∫s Franco in 1992, it included footage of Welles in Spain that had been taken from In the Land of Don Quixote - even though Welles had never intended any crossover between the two projects, and Rosenbaum considered the resulting effect \\"lamentable\\". Welles was responsible for the filming and editing of the series, but not for the Italian-language narration, which was done by the RAI-TV network after they took the project out of his hands. According to Jonathan Rosenbaum: \\"'The programs are essentially black-and- white home movies, shot with a cameraman from Spanish TV (an Italian[-speaking] cameraman for the Prado) and an Italian sound person...The version edited by Orson Welles contains no narration, but RAI adds a narration of its own, written by playwright and stage director Gian Paolo Callegari with the assistance of Antonio Navarro Linares and spoken by Arnoldo Fo√†.\\" Episodes The series has nine episodes, titled as follows: *1. \\"Itinerario Andaluso (Andalusian Itinerary)\\" - Andalusia, Segovia and Ronda *2. \\"Spagna Santa (Holy Week in Spain)\\" - Seville *3. \\"La Feria de San Fermin (The San Fermin Holidays)\\" - Pamplona *4. \\"Lo Encierro di Pamplona (The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona)\\" - Pamplona *5. \\"Le Cantine di Jerez (The Caves of Jerez)\\" - Jerez *6. \\"Siviglia (Seville)\\" - Seville *7. \\"Le Feria di Aprile a Siviglia (April Fair in Seville)\\" - Seville - This episode was not screened during the original run. *8. \\"Tempo di Flamenco (Time for Flamenco)\\" - Barcelona *9. \\"Roma e Oriente in Spagna (Rome and the Orient in Spain's Past)\\" - Granada, Toledo, C√≥rdoba, Gibraltar, Seville and Palos Restoration The series has been restored by the Munich Film Museum. Welles had no input into the commentary, so the restoration uses the original background music track (which Welles selected), playing it louder, with the commentary removed entirely. One episode, largely dedicated to Beatrice learning the flamenco, was originally not aired by RAI-TV on the grounds that it was of limited interest, although it has subsequently been restored by the Munich Film Museum. Both the restored and the unrestored versions have aired on Italian television in recent years. Critical reception Welles biographer Clinton Heylin sees the series as a slight effort, writing that the series was \\"little more than home movies of his trips to Spain.\\"Clinton Heylin, Despite the System: Orson Welles versus the Hollywood studios (Canongate, Edinburgh, 2005) p.334 Joseph McBride concurs, stating \\"the TV episodes never transcend their casual, rambling, touristy approach\\", likening it to an \\"indulgent father's home movie\\".

Bruno Newman is a businessman from Mexico City. He is the founder and co director of Zimat Consultores, a publisher, photographer and the founder of the Museo del Objeto del Objeto (MODO). Career Newman has a bachelor's degree in communications from the Universidad Iberoamericana . He has worked in communications and human resources in both the public and private sectors. He has been a consultant to a number of businesses, cultural institutions, philanthropic organizations and professional associations. In 1984, Newman founded Zimat Consultores, a large communication firm in Mexico City, which he still runs with partner Marta Mej√≠a. Zimat benefitted from the boom in public relations in Mexico in the 1980s and 1990s, with the company quickly grew from five employees to more than sixty consultants that made the agency number one in Mexico in terms of billing by the end of the 1990s. The firm merged with U.S. enterprise Golin/Harris, giving the cooperation access to markets in Mexico, other parts of the Latin America and Spanish speaking markets in the United States. In the early 2000s, the firm was acquired by Interpublic Group of Companies, but today it is again independent and the exclusive partner for the Interpublic Group in Mexico. Newman has remained as director of Zimat. Today, clients include Avon, Body Shop, BBVA Bancomer, Cemex, Cuauht√©moc Moctezuma Brewery, Cin√©polis, Colgate, Fondo Mexicano para la Conservaci√≥n de la Naturaleza, Grupo Bimbo, Hewlett Packard and HSBC . In addition to his work with Zimat, Newman is an author and photographer, publishing work related to his field as well as his personal interest in the ordinary. He published Organizaciones en la mira. Comunicaci√≥n estrat√©gica para prevenir y manejar las crisis with Marta Mej√≠a in 2009. In Paris, he took 450 photographs, eighty of which were published in a book called ‚ÄúEl banquete del las banquetas.‚Äù The idea to photograph the city, focusing on sidewalks, occurred while he was there with his wife and was attracted by a metallic hatch which had an interesting texture due to the loss of paint. He has received a number of recognitions for his professional and philanthropic work. He is the first from Latin America to have been accredited by the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) . He was the founder and first president of the Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Comunicaci√≥n Organizacional (AMCO) in 1973, president of SIGNUM in 1992, president of PRO RP and the Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Agencias Profesionales de Relaciones P√∫blicas, AC in 1997. Newman is a member of the board the Consejo Mexicano para la Filantropia (Cemefi), and president of A Leer/IBBY M√©xico, which promotes literacy in the country. As a collector and founder of MODO Bruno Newman is a longtime collector, mostly of packaging and ordinary objects. He has a collection of over 30,000 objects in thirty categories such as household products, food packages, medicine bottles, cosmetics and toys. Newman began collecting when he was thirteen years old. His uncle collected stamps and he was inspired by these stamp albums. He began collecting stamps from Spain, England and Mexico, preferring the Mexican ones because of their designs, especially the old ones. Collecting packaging and other pieces for their designs began with four or five containers from a line of beauty products called Pompeii. They had been imported from France in 1910 and when he displayed them on a table, he received positive comments. From then he went on to shaving supplies, old toys, old advertisements and more, mostly bought at local flea markets. He concentrated on items that were not considered collectibles, but rather on items that caught his attraction because of age, color, the slogans and/or the designs. Over his lifetime, the collection outgrew his room, house and office until he had three warehouses for the collection. Today, he still collects, going to flea markets on Saturdays. In 2010, Newman made the collection the base for a new museum dedicated to design and communication called Museo del Objeto del Objeto (Object of the Object Museum). He opened this museum in Colonia Roma of Mexico City, in a 1906 Art Nouveau building that used to be his home. The museum collection has about 30,000 pieces that date from 1810 to the present. They are mostly everyday objects from product packaging, utensils, cosmetics, clothing and many others. Only a small fraction of the collection is on display at the museum at any time. La Gunilla is the editorial arm of the Museo del Objeto del Objeto. Newman created this enterprise with partner Gonzalo Tassier, to publish works focused on design and collecting. The name is a play on the name Lagunilla, which has a famous market for collectors. Books published by this organization include ‚ÄúMextencil‚Äùby Edgar Vargas and ‚ÄúArte Urbe‚Äù by Flavio Montessoro focused on ‚Äúurban‚Äù or ‚Äústreet‚Äù art, mostly graffiti and stencil art. La Gunilla has also published works by Newman and Tassier, as part of a series of books called ‚ÄúCon-juntos.‚Äù Two of the books in this series, a ‚ÄúUna gruesa de colecciones‚Äù and ‚ÄúEncuentros con conocidos‚Äù both focus on Newman's personal experience as a collector.

Gregory (deceased), brother Robert E. Bettis Jr. and sister Shari Lynn Bettis. He attended Southern Illinois University on a partial scholarship as a member of the Saluki Gymnastics Team, coached by multiple- time Olympic coach Bill Meade, where Bettis broke numerous records in both floor exercise and vaulting. After three years working at Opryland USA in Nashville, Tennessee, as a dancer and then assistant to the choreographer, he went on to pursue a career in musical theater. He toured with the Hamburg, Germany, production of Cats and two years later returned to the United States to join the fourth national tour of Cats as Tumblebrutus, eventually joining the Broadway company from 1989 to 91 and 1996‚Äì97. In 1992 Bettis was a part of the dance group Boys Back East who were the grand national champions on Star Search. In 1992, Bettis joined the Broadway revival of 'Guys & Dolls', in 1994 moved over to the Broadway production of 'Miss Saigon' and later that year joined the 1st National Tour of 'Miss Saigon' from 1994 to 96.

Baker is the artistic director of the arts organisation Daily Life Ltd. A hallmark of Baker's work is food being used as an artistic medium. As John Daniel writes, 'Food - shopping for it, cooking it, serving it, consuming it - is a consistent feature in Baker's work, which focuses on the seemingly mundane, everyday details of life' (2007:246) Drawing from her own personal and family experiences, her work explores the relationship between art and lived experience and addresses the splitting of women's domestic and professional lives. Claire MacDonald points out how her artistic trajectory - moving from early food sculptures to later performances and installations - reflects the changing agenda of women's movement. Information Baker lives in London, England. She studied painting at St. Martins School of Art (now Central Saint Martins) between 1968 and 1972. In 1973 she attended Goldsmiths, University of London to take the Art Teachers Certificate. She was awarded an honorary Doctorate by Queen Mary University London in 2011. In a career spanning over four decades she has, among other things, danced with meringue ladies; made a life-sized edible version of her family; and driven around the streets of Haarlem, Holland strapped to the back of a truck yelling at passers by through a megaphone to Pull Yourselves Together. Daily Life Ltd is an arts organisation that produces the work of Baker and others. Together they create powerful art that investigates and questions the way people think about feminism, daily life and mental health. These artworks cross many disciplines and provide unique, high quality artistic experiences for a wide range of audiences both nationally and internationally. They seek to challenge the stigmatisation and discrimination of people with experience of mental distress and raise public awareness of this vital sector. In March 2011 Daily Life Ltd became part of Arts Council England‚Äôs National Portfolio.  Key Works  * An Edible Family in a Mobile Home (1976) is a performance where Baker sculpted life size models of her own family out of cake, inviting 'guests' participating in the performance to eat, as she served them tea. * Drawing on a Mother's Experience (1988) is a performance to camera that depicts Baker creating a live drawing out of pressed beef, Guinness, milk, fish pie and treacle on a double white sheet. She makes a work 'parodying Jackson Pollock's vigorous masculine action painting of the 1950s, substituting the materials of a mother's experience for paint'. After covering the sheet in the materials, she clears up, packing her bags and damping away the food, before dredging the work in white flour, lying down and wrapping herself in the sheet, and dancing with difficulty to Nina Simone's 'My Baby Just Cares For Me', before walking off as the music fades. * Daily Life (1991-2001) A quintet of site-specific shows that were performed in her own kitchen, her childrens school and the local church. The quintet consists of Kitchen Show, How to Shop, Take a Peek!, Grown-up School, and Box Story. These were a collaboration with co-director Polona Baloh Brown * How to Live (2004) Drawing from her own experience being treated with Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) - a form of cognitive behavioural therapy - Baker performs a self-styled mental-health guru imparting an 11-steps programme for a happy life. Staged as public seminar, Baker demonstrates the programme by treating one of her patients - a frozen pea. The piece emerged out of a collaboration with psychologist and social anthropologist Dr. Richard Hallam (funded by the Wellcome Trust). * Drawing on a (Grand) Mother's Experience (2015) is a re-staging of the work Drawing on a Mother's Experience as a part of the Women of the World festival at the Southbank Centre, London in March 2015. The work expands on her experience as a working mother and the challenges she faced while navigating the mental health system. She follows the original structure of Drawing on a Mother's Experience, while now aided by a performance assistant. Once she arrives at the original ending, standing wrapped in the canvas, she unwraps herself and sets the sheet back down in order to then add chocolate cakes, ketchup, sparkling water, oats, and peas. She then hoists the sheet over her head, creating a head-hole so that the canvas can be worn like a poncho. She finally shimmies out of the canvas, dancing away once again to 'My Baby Just Cares for Me'. She revived the work for the same festival on 8 March 2020. Activism Baker's 2009 Wellcome Trust Diary Drawing exhibition about her experience of mental illness and recovery launched her onto a worldwide platform of mental health and arts campaigners, connecting her with a growing network of organisations and practitioners. Since then, she has aimed to use her position to help promote and foster opportunities for diverse marginalised artists. Her work focuses on undervalued and stigmatised aspects of everyday life and human behaviour, expressly undertaking to foreground the lives of women in the mainstream and bring status to so-called ‚Äòhumble‚Äô daily activity. Baker's work explores feminist themes, framing the women's movement and marking its changes of agenda, moving from early work in food sculpture to later performances and installations which map the equivalences and commonalities between composing art and composing a life. She took an eight-year-long break from art to have two children, and her subsequent art investigated the relationship of art and lived experience, particularly in works such as Cook Dems, Kitchen Show and How to Shop. As an internationally acclaimed female artist with personal experience of mental illness and physical disability, Baker offers an authentic figure of recovery and leadership through creativity. She is uniquely positioned with the experience, insight, talent and extensive cross- disciplinary network to investigate and celebrate creative ways people manage difficulties and disenfranchisement. On 6 March 2020, as part of the Women of the World festival, Baker will lead a panel entitled Sticky Labels: Women and the Mental Health System, investigating why women have been branded everything from ‚Äòwitches‚Äô to ‚Äòmorally insane‚Äô. It is described as a discussion to explore the politics of women and mental health, and the misogyny within the contemporary psychiatric diagnostic framework. Other panelists will include Dr. Leyla Hussein, Dr. Akima Thomas, and Professor Mary Boyle.

Gregory Gerrer, OSB (July 23, 1867August 24, 1946) was a Benedictine Priest at Sacred Heart Abbey (later, St. Gregory's Abbey), artist, art historian and museum founder. Art career From 1900 to 1904, Gerrer studied art in Rome. Shortly after the election of Pope Pius X, Gerrer participated in a competition of artists to paint the official portrait of the new pope. When Pius saw the finished portrait by Gerrer, he selected it to be his portrait. Pius said that he choose it because the artist painted the him true to life and did not minimize his facial warts. Gerrer also painted portraits of two World War I Choctaw code talkers, Otis Leader and Joseph Oklahombi. The largest collection of his paintings are at the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art in Shawnee, Oklahoma. His work is also in the Vatican art collection, Rome, Snite Museum of Art in South Bend, Indiana, and Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art in Norman, Oklahoma.

It was made during a break in the filming of The Other Side of the Wind. There is some ambiguity about what Welles intended to do with the footage, and how he was going to compile it.Vassili Slovic, Orson Welles: the One Man Band (1995) - documentary on Welles' unfinished projects.

In 1999 the Munich Film Museum then edited together the rushes into a 22-minute cut, which has subsequently been screened at numerous film festivals. The restored footage has never been released on video or DVD, although some unrestored clips can be seen in Vassili Slovic's 1995 documentary Orson Welles: the One Man Band.

The construction of the aircraft was sponsored by the Saginaw Junior Chamber of Commerce, prompting the nose art \\"Saginaw Junior\\". The Carr Special was built to compete in the Curtiss OX-5-powered class of the 1932 National Air Races, where many of the competitors were still biplanes. The Carr Special was built around part of the fuselage as well as the OX-5 engine from a Travel Air 2000 biplane. It was a low wing strut-braced conventional landing gear monoplane with steel tube construction with aircraft fabric covering. Operational history The Carr Special was entered in the 1932 National Air Races in the \\"Free for All\\", but pulled out after being lapped by all but one other entrant, and in the precision landing contest. Despite the poor showing, the aircraft would later win 22 races. The aircraft was then modified for skywriting, and later modified again with a Warner Scarab radial engine.

Directed by Welles, the show starred Welles (\\"Orson the Magnificent\\"), Cotten (\\"Jo-Jo the Great\\"), Agnes Moorehead (\\"Calliope Aggie\\") and Rita Hayworth, whose part was later filled by Marlene Dietrich. Jean Gabin also worked on the show backstage, as a propman. The show ran to 150 minutes. Background Orson Welles leaving his Army physical examination after being judged unfit for military service (May 6, 1943) In early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (Ceiling Unlimited, Hello Americans) that Orson Welles created for CBS to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on Jane Eyre and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director,Charvet, David, \\"Orson Welles and The Mercury Wonder Show\\". Magic, An Independent Magazine for Magicians, Volume 2 Number 12, August 1993 and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he called The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel. \\"It was just like a circus ‚Äî I would have adored it if I'd been a member of the audience, I know that,\\" Welles later told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. The development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's draft status in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F ‚Äî unfit for military service ‚Äî for a variety of medical reasons. \\"I felt guilty about the war,\\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \\"I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status.\\"Leaming, Barbara, If This Was Happiness: A Biography of Rita Hayworth. New York: Viking, 1989 He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since Citizen Kane, when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.McBride, Joseph, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A Portrait of an Independent Career. Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 2006, Welles's fascination with illusion dated back to childhood; Harry Houdini gave him his first lessons in magic. His 1941 debut at the California State Fair (assisted by Dolores del R√≠o) was a hit and, as \\"The Ace\\", he continued practicing his performance skills at vaudeville theaters and army camps. By 1943 Welles had developed a two-hour magic show. Rehearsal and previews George (Shorty) Chirello, Joseph Cotten, Eleanor Counts and Orson Welles The show's name was a nod to Howard Thurston's The Wonder Show of the Universe. Welles adapted at least five of Thurston's illusions for his own show, and adopted his use of showgirls as stage extras. For The Mercury Wonder Show, Welles selected Rita Hayworth, one of the most popular women in motion pictures, as his chief assistant. In April 1943 he began teaching illusions to Hayworth, who was then living with him. The couple practiced the Houdini Substitution Trunk routine in the 125-seat private theater of Bill Larsen, a successful Los Angeles attorney and magician who operated Thayer's Studio of Magic. Other cast included co-producer Joseph Cotten and, in his stage debut as comedy assistant, Welles's chauffeur, George (Shorty) Chirello. Welles hired Keye Luke ‚Äî an accomplished visual artist as well as an actor ‚Äî to design culturally authentic scenery and graphics, in contrast to the fake-Oriental visuals typically seen in Western magic shows. The show was rehearsed for 17 weeks. Welles leased the Playtime Theatre (later the Las Palmas Theatre), a 350-seat house in Hollywood. Welles initially planned a moderate-sized magic show, open only to service members, that would run six weeks at the theatre and then tour army camps.Whaley, Barton, Orson Welles: The Man Who Was Magic. Lybrary.com, 2005, Welles and the cast rehearsed from 7 p.m. until 2 or 3 a.m.; back home, Welles would spend the rest of the night improving the magic act and working out new bits of business. He tested 18 different openings before he was satisfied. Previews began in June. As the show came together Welles began calling it \\"the biggest magic show on earth\\", and the cast and crew grew to 31 people. Welles bought or commissioned $26,000 worth of props and put $14,000 into the tent, scenery, costumes and rental of circus equipment. He also rented an entire menagerie, from a canary to a lion. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer donated the venue, a lot near the Hollywood Canteen on Cahuenga Boulevard. Production The Mercury Wonder Show ran August 3‚ÄìSeptember 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent located at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood.Wheldon, Wynn Pierce, \\"Orson Welles the Magician\\". Genii, The Conjurors' Magazine, Volume 63 Number 2, February 15, 2000 The brand-new, two-pole Big Top offered 1,100 bleacher seats ‚Äî all of them free ‚Äî to service members. In the center were 400 folding chairs for the public, with tickets priced at $1.65 to $5.50 for adults and 55 cents for children. For opening night only, the public seats were $5.50 and $11. Charity-minded Hollywood celebrities could pay $30 (the equivalent of $ today) for one of the 25 to 30 seats in the sucker section; it cost $50 or $100 for one of the two super-sucker seats nailed down directly behind the massive tent poles. Welles recalled subjecting this highest-paying public ‚Äî \\"usually Sam Goldwyn or Jack Warner or somebody like that\\" ‚Äî to humiliations that included having eggs broken over their heads. \\"And they had to pretend it was all good fun, because our boys in khaki were there, you know. We really gave it to them.\\" After performing in the official premiere August 3, Rita Hayworth was thereafter forbidden to appear in The Mercury Wonder Show by Columbia boss Harry Cohn. When her lawyer confirmed that Hayworth could indeed be sued for breach of contract ‚Äî filming was then under way for Cover Girl ‚Äî Welles persuaded her not to jeopardize her entire career by going on anyway, as she vowed to do. He phoned his friend Marlene Dietrich and asked her to fill in. \\"Come teach me the tricks and I do it,\\" Dietrich replied. \\"She was the good soldier of all time,\\" Welles said. At intermission September 7, 1943, KMPC radio interviewed audience and cast members of The Mercury Wonder Show ‚Äî including Welles and Hayworth, who were married earlier that day. Welles remarked that The Mercury Wonder Show had been performed for approximately 48,000 members of the U.S. armed forces.Wood, Bret, Orson Welles: A Bio- Bibliography. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1990 Looking back on the experience 30 years later, Welles said the show was primarily made \\"for fun\\", but that \\"it's one of our great works\\" and that the Mercury Theatre were \\"as proud of that as anything we ever did.\\"Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum, This is Orson Welles.

The film segment was directed by Welles, uncredited. Welles and Dietrich agreed to appear in the film while The Mercury Wonder Show was still running. The seven-minute segment was shot on the Universal lot in late September 1943. Welles traded his robe and fez for white tie and tails, and brought along a crew from the show ‚Äî Shorty Chirello, Tommy Hanlon, Professor Bill and his Circus Symphony, Death Valley Mack, two female assistants and eight chorus girls. Welles performed a few illusions; his own appearance on stage and the comic version of the sawing-a-woman-in-half illusion featuring Dietrich were achieved with trick photography. Welles received $30,000 for his part in the film. The segment was to be shot in four or five days, but Welles stretched filming to 16 days to give additional pay to his crew. =Memorabilia= A framed copy of the playbill for The Mercury Wonder Show was sold at auction October 31, 2002, for $1,610.

Personal life and career  Frederick Wills was born in Devon, England, and came to Australia around 1889. He settled in Sydney and lived at Croydon working as an artist. He married in 1895 and moved to Queensland in 1897 where he was employed as an illustrator and photographer for Queensland Department of Agriculture. He worked there until 1903 and it was in this period that he was involved in pioneering cinematography in Queensland. After his resignation in 1903 he operated a photographic studio in George Street Brisbane for two years.Frederick Wills biography, ANU Wills and his family then moved to Toowoomba where he started a photographic equipment business and photo studio in Ruthven Street. This business prospered until 1914 when he left Toowoomba, it is not certain where he went from there as there are no surviving records apart from his obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1955 which noted he had died in Rowena in north-western New South Wales.

The films were screened only once at the Department of Agriculture in Brisbane and were never used again. They were stored away along with the camera and did not re-surface until the building was being renovated in 1955 when they were donated to the Queensland Museum. The films were sent in 1982 to the National Film and Sound Archive where they were copied to modern 35mm stock for preservation.Frederick Charles Wills - Queensland's Pioneer of Cinematography, DPI Publications, 2000 The films are unique due to being the first known films taken by any government agency anywhere in the world.Queensland Museum They are the largest surviving collection of Australian colonial films and include the first films taken of Brisbane and some of the earliest footage taken of Sydney.

The way Shirazi pigeons fly is a combination of turning around the loft and going to a distance and keep coming back. They fly as a kit. They are saddle (in different colours black, brown etc.) with a marking from the head all the way through the back.

It was staged as part of the 1999 AFL finals series to determine which of the two clubs would qualify for that season's Grand Final. Essendon entered the match as heavy favourites, but Carlton recorded a narrow upset victory by one point. The match has become one of the most significant moments in the traditional rivalry between the Carlton and Essendon Football Clubs. Background The 1999 AFL season was contested by sixteen clubs between March and September 1999. The top eight clubs qualified for the finals series, which was conducted under the McIntyre final eight system. Essendon had been the best team throughout the season. The club finished the home-and-away season as the minor premiers, with a win-loss record of 18‚Äì4. Essendon comfortably beat eighth seed by 69 points in the qualifying final, earning a bye in the second week of the finals to advance directly to the preliminary final. Entering the match, Essendon had won eight matches in a row. Carlton, during the home-and-away season, had struggled to reach the finals. After its Round 16 match, a 76-point loss against Essendon, Carlton sat tenth on the ladder, and coach David Parkin publicly called his side a \\"B-grade team\\". Eventually, Carlton finished sixth with a win-loss record of 12‚Äì10. In its qualifying final at the Gabba, Carlton was comprehensively beaten by third seed by 73 points; but Carlton was not eliminated because the seventh and eighth seeds had both lost their qualifying finals. In the semi-final the following week, Carlton defeated fifth seed by 54 points to progress to the preliminary final; West Coast was the home team, but due to a contract between the AFL and the Melbourne Cricket Club, the match was played at the M.C.G. in Melbourne, instead of Subiaco Oval in Perth. The winner of the preliminary final would progress to the Grand Final on 25 September, against the Kangaroos, who had won the Second Preliminary Final the previous night. Because of their respective form-lines, Essendon was an overwhelming favourite to win the preliminary final and progress to the Grand Final. On the morning of the match, bookmakers were offering odds of $1.18 for an Essendon victory and $4.25 for a Carlton victory. =Rivalry= In 1999, there was already an existing, strong rivalry between Carlton and Essendon. Together with and , they made up the AFL's \\"Big Four\\" ‚Äì the four most successful Melbourne-based clubs on-field and off-field through the league's history ‚Äì and as a result there was a natural rivalry between the successful clubs; but, the Carlton‚ÄìEssendon rivalry particularly intensified after the appointment of Kevin Sheedy as Essendon coach in 1981; it was intensified further by Essendon's upset victory against Carlton in the 1993 Grand Final, and by 1999 it was one of the most celebrated rivalries in the league. Carlton stirred up the rivalry twice in the week leading up to the match. After the semi-final win against West Coast, Carlton defender Glenn Manton, who began his career with Essendon but had just played his 100th game for Carlton, told his team-mates \\"I hope we stick it up the Bombers next week\\" in a post-game speech in the dressing rooms, which happened to be televised. Then, during the week, Carlton president John Elliott attacked Essendon in media for having \\"cheated\\" its way to the 1993 premiership ‚Äì a reference to the fact that Essendon had recently been found guilty of breaching the league's salary cap around that time.  Match summary  = First half = Carlton kicked to the Punt Road end of the ground in the first quarter. Carlton started strongly, and kicked the first two goals of the match before Essendon kicked its first. Carlton continued to win strongly out of the midfield, and led by more than three goals towards the end of the quarter. A few late behinds to Essendon narrowed the margin to 16 points, the score 6.3 (39) to 3.5 (23). The gameplay was more even in the second quarter, but only two goals were kicked, both by Carlton: one to Aaron Hamill early in the quarter from a turnover, and one to Lance Whitnall late in the quarter. Essendon had more scoring shots in the quarter, but scored only 0.5 to Carlton's 2.1, to trail by an inaccurate 3.10 (28) to 8.4 (52) at half time. Carlton had the better of the midfield match-ups throughout the first half, particularly the match-up between Scott Camporeale and Darren Bewick; Camporeale provided much of Carlton's midfield drive, while Bewick did not have an influence. Carlton's Brett Ratten was also prominent, breaking the tag of Joe Misiti. Carlton also used the unexpected tactic of playing defender Glenn Manton as a defensive full-forward on Dustin Fletcher, which resulted in Fletcher's influence being reduced; but, it resulted in defender Stephen Silvagni matching up on Essendon full forward Matthew Lloyd, which worked in Essendon's favour. = Third quarter = After two minutes, an error from Carlton's Craig Bradley on a kick-in led directly to a goal to Essendon's Michael Long. This was the start of a fifteen-minute period of play which was dominated by Essendon. Essendon hit the lead after only nine minutes, and over the fifteen minutes the Bombers went inside-50 eleven times and kicked six goals, while Carlton went inside-50 only once for no score. Essendon had more opportunities to extend the lead shortly afterwards, but Lloyd, Fletcher and Dean Rioli all missed set-shots from inside 50m. Carlton was able to break Essendon's run with late goals, but overall Essendon kicked 7.7 to Carlton's 2.2 in the third quarter, and led 10.17 (77) to 10.6 (66) at three-quarter time. Essendon's resurgence and dominance in the third quarter came when the team began to win in the midfield, particularly through the efforts of Michael Long and Darren Bewick. After the match-up between Camporeale and Bewick had favoured Carlton in the first half, Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy moved Chris Heffernan onto Camporeale, which both limited Camporeale's influence and freed up Bewick. Dean Rioli kicked two goals during Essendon's revival. = Final Quarter = Essendon's Steven Alessio kicked the opening goal of the final quarter to extend the lead to 17 points, before Carlton kicked the next four goals ‚Äì to Fraser Brown, Anthony Koutoufides, Matthew Lappin, and Koutoufides again ‚Äì to take the lead by seven points. Koutoufides sparked the Carlton revival, moving into the midfield for the final quarter, and winning several clearances. Additionally, after Bewick had been influential in the midfield in the third quarter, retiring Carlton tagger Matthew Hogg (who had spent much of the match on the bench) was moved onto him, limiting him to only one disposal in the final quarter. Lloyd kicked the next two goals, for a personal match tally of five, to regain the lead for Essendon by less than a goal. Carlton scored the next two goals after that ‚Äì the first to Hamill, the second to Whitnall from outside 50m, and in both cases assisted by Hogg ‚Äì to regain the lead by 8 points early in time-on. Essendon attacked hard, but its forward thrusts were repeatedly repelled by Carlton's defence, including Koutoufides, who had dropped back. With 2:18 remaining on the timekeepers' clock, Mark Johnson kicked a goal for Essendon, to narrow the margin to two points. With 55 seconds remaining, Mark Mercuri gathered the ball from a broken marking contest 25m in front of the Essendon goals; his quick, bouncing snap shot for goal narrowly missed to the left, reducing the margin to one point. Bradley's kick-in was marked strongly on Essendon's right half-forward flank by Essendon's Barry Young, who kicked the ball back to the goal-face. It was cleared hurriedly by Carlton's Dean Rice, but Rice's kick went straight to Essendon's Dean Wallis, who was unmarked in the centre circle. With 38 seconds remaining, Wallis advanced and tried to baulk around Fraser Brown, but Brown tackled him to the ground and the ball spilled free. Carlton cleared the ball forward, ending with a mark to Justin Murphy, who was able to run out the clock preparing for a set shot. Murphy had the ball in his hands when the siren sounded, and Carlton won by one point. Notable moments Two moments in the match are best remembered: Anthony Koutoufides' final quarter, and Fraser Brown's last-minute tackle on Dean Wallis. Koutoufides was instrumental to Carlton's victory in the final quarter. He moved into the midfield at the start of the quarter, won clearances, and drifted forward to kick two goals. After his second goal, he started dropping into the backline after contesting the centre bounces, where he took three contested marks to repel Essendon's attacks. He had ten kicks, two handpasses, six marks and two goals for the quarter; in a special analysis done for the game, Koutoufides would have earned 127 Champion Data ranking points for the quarter. After the match, club legend (and later, president) Stephen Kernahan described Koutoufides' performance as \\"the greatest quarter of football ever played\\". Years later, it is still regarded as one of the greatest ever individual performances in finals matches. Fraser Brown's tackle on Dean Wallis is widely remembered as the decisive single moment of the match. Brown later said that he had anticipated that Wallis would try to baulk around him, and was fortunate enough to guess the direction correctly. After Carlton had surrendered the lead in the third quarter, vice-captain Stephen Silvagni delivered an impromptu three-quarter time address to his team-mates. Silvagni took almost the entire three-quarter time break, and coach David Parkin had little time left to deliver his coach's address. Parkin later described it as \\"the most emotional and appropriately-timed inspirational talk\\" he'd ever heard a player deliver. Essendon was left to lament its inaccuracy in front of goals. Essendon had 33 scoring shots to Carlton's 24, but lost the match. Mark Mercuri and Blake Caracella, normally very accurate goalkickers, scored 0.7 between them. Aftermath Carlton progressed to the 1999 AFL Grand Final the following week against the Kangaroos. Essendon became the first minor premiers to miss the Grand Final since 1983. It was Essendon's second one-point loss in a preliminary final in just four years, after the Sydney Swans defeated them in 1996, courtesy of an after-the-siren behind to Tony Lockett. In the lead-up to the Grand Final during the week, Aaron Hamill was cited on video evidence for kneeing Dean Wallis in the head while the latter was on the ground during the third quarter. Hamill was found guilty and the AFL Tribunal initially suspended him for two matches, which would have seen him miss the Grand Final. Carlton then successfully appealed the suspension, using the testimony of biomechanics experts to convince the appeals board that the contact was accidental; years later, Hamill admitted to kneeing Wallis deliberately, and described the biomechanics testimony as \\"a tactic to bore the hell out of the appeals board\\". Wallis was reported on the day for striking Michael Sexton in the first quarter, but was cleared by the tribunal. In the Grand Final, Carlton was unable to keep up with the Kangaroos through the game, trailing by 20 points at half time, then 43 points at three-quarter time. The final score was Kangaroos 19.10 (124) d. Carlton 12.17 (89). Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy forced the losing preliminary final team to attend the Grand Final as spectators as a motivational tactic, an experience described by midfielder Joe Misiti as the worst experience of his life. Essendon went on to dominate the 2000 AFL season, with an all-time record win/loss record of 24‚Äì1 for the season (including finals), winning the premiership, the minor premiership, the pre-season competition, and winning a preliminary final rematch against Carlton by 45 points.  Legacy  The 1999 Preliminary Final caused a significant shift in the dynamic of the rivalry between Carlton and Essendon. Across the previous twenty years, the results of the rivalry ‚Äì including the 1993 Grand Final, the close games and the controversies ‚Äì had overwhelmingly favoured Essendon. However, the 1999 Preliminary Final result was seen as such a triumph for Carlton that it has become the defining event of the rivalry. The fact that Carlton went on to lose the Grand Final to the Kangaroos is typically seen as irrelevant in the context of this game and the rivalry; by preventing the highly fancied Bombers from winning the premiership, the win is compared with and often treated like a premiership by Carlton fans. In 2007, Herald Sun columnist Trevor Grant humorously referred to the win as Carlton's \\"prelimiership\\". Coach David Parkin has commented that he is asked about this match at least as often as any of the Grand Finals he coached during his long career.

The contract then in place between the AFL and the MCC required that one finals match be played at the M.C.G. each week during the finals. Brisbane and West Coast had both earned the right to host a semi-final, so the semi-final of the lower-seeded team (West Coast) was moved to Melbourne. :2. The First and Second Preliminary Finals are named based on the teams competing in them, not based on the chronological order in which they take place. See McIntyre final eight system for more information. :3. At the time of this game, Carlton, under Elliott's guidance, had also been breaching the salary cap, but this was unknown at the time. The scandal was not revealed until three years later, at the end of the 2002 season. :4. History shows that in 1999, Matthew Lloyd was Essendon's best forward, and Stephen Silvagni was Carlton's best defender. However, Silvagni had a weakness against Lloyd's strong leading style of play, so Glenn Manton was Carlton's usual preferred match-up for Lloyd. :5. Champion Data ranking is a statistical method developed during the 2000s and best known for its use in the Supercoach fantasy football competition. A score of 127 is considered to be an excellent score for an entire match, so for Koutoufides to have earned this score in just the final quarter highlights his dominance.

The best-of-seven playoff matched the Chunichi Dragons and Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, the respective champions of the Central League's and the Pacific League's Climax Series (postseason). The Series began on Saturday, November 12, 2011 and was a rematch of the 1999 Japan Series, which the Hawks won, four games to one. The Hawks won the series in seven games, claiming their fifth Japan Series crown.  Climax Series  Summary Road to the Series =Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks= After not having won a playoff series since 2003 when they won the Japan Series that year, the Hawks finally broke through against the Saitama Seibu Lions. Earning a first-round bye and a one-game advantage in the Pacific League Climax Series Final Stage, the Hawks completed the sweep of the Lions to earn their spot in the Japan Series. During the regular season, the Hawks were the best team in the league record-wise at 88-46-10. They scored the second-most runs in the league (550) and allowed the fewest (351), while also stealing the most bases and leading the league in team batting average (.267). Leading the team offensively was new acquisition Seiichi Uchikawa, who led the entire league in batting average at .338. He was helped by two longtime Hawks mainstays at the top of the lineup, Munenori Kawasaki and Yuichi Honda, who stole 91 bases between them. Providing the power was Nobuhiro Matsuda, who finally had a breakout season with 25 home runs and 83 runs batted in, both team highs. In a pitching-heavy year for NPB, the Hawks had a three-headed monster that finished 3-4-5 in ERA. Tsuyoshi Wada (16-5, 1.51), Toshiya Sugiuchi (8-7, 1.91) and D. J. Houlton (19-6, 2.19) anchored the Hawks rotation, and Houlton had the most wins by a foreigner since Gene Bacque. The bullpen featured another breakout star in Masahiko Morifuku, who led the team in holds with 34 and had a 1.13 ERA to go along with it. Closing duties were split between regular closer Takahiro Mahara and another stellar foreigner, Brian Falkenborg, who each had 19 saves. =Chunichi Dragons= Chunichi also won the Central League with the best record at 75-59-10, defeating the Tokyo Yakult Swallows 4-2 in the Central League Climax Series. The Dragons had been to the Japan Series the previous season but fell to the Chiba Lotte Marines in seven games. This was Chunichi's third Japan Series appearance in the last five years, winning in 2007 against the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. Returning largely the same team as the previous season, the Dragons showcased an excellent pitching staff that covered up for a league-worst offense that only batted .228 as a team. The offensive leaders were Tony Blanco, who hit 16 home runs during the season while batting .248. Masahiro Araki led the team in batting average at .263 and also stolen bases with 18. The pitching staff was led by a stellar foreigner of their own in Maximo Nelson, who may have had a losing record at 10-14 with a 2.52 ERA, but was the only pitcher on the staff who threw 200 innings. Veteran Kazuki Yoshimi offset this with an 18-3 record and a 1.63 ERA, and Taiwanese lefty Chen Wei-Yin added eight wins of his own. The bullpen was the real star, though, as it had four relievers who posted ERA's under 2.00. Takuya Asao led the pack with a nigh-unhittable 0.41 ERA and a 7-2 record while also leading the league in holds with 45 and also getting 10 saves. Masato Kobayashi also was dominant with a 0.87 ERA and 18 holds in 58 innings, and Yoshihiro Suzuki added 12 holds of his own while also posting a 1.08 ERA. The anchor in the bullpen was longtime closer Hitoki Iwase, who saved 37 games during the season.

It is brought about by the rise of a new, third party who enter government and combat a massive influx of African refugees, which have been allied in part by the principle opposition faction known as the secessionists, culminating into a multiple party conflict. Premise The novel's story is told in an achronological fashion, jumping back and forth between several time periods. The protagonist, a former professor of English named Alan Whitman, is initially concerned only with protecting his wife and daughter but is gradually drawn further into the broader conflict over the course of events. The narrative consists of three broad time periods: the early days of the conflict, in which Whitman goes about his life while being casually aware of the burgeoning crisis, a later period in which he and his family have been displaced from London and are travelling the countryside in search of safety and a final period in which he is travelling through the heavily war-torn countryside with a group of male refugees, a setting which initially makes no mention of the fate of his wife and daughter. The narrative jumps back and forth between the different time periods rapidly, creating a stark contrast between the different stages of conflict and the nature of Whitman's character at these different points, as well as generating tension by not illustrating how the increasingly degraded state of affairs has come to pass. = Main characters = Alan Whitman: A former college lecturer who soon becomes a refugee along with his wife and daughter. The story starts with the family abandoning their house and travelling away from the various warring factions of the country. He overall shows more favourability to the Secessionists faction in the early parts of the novel while the conflict was just starting. However, he is later torn between the factions as each commit atrocities which greatly affect him towards the end of the novel and later progression of the conflict. this is concluded by the revelation of his families whereabouts and eventual discovery of their fate. He never officially endorses a particular side and becomes distrustful of each faction towards the end of the conflict. Isobel: Whitman's wife who shares a strained relationship with her husband, which is explained by several past events in the book and culminates in their separation. She is later missing alongside Sally, Alan later discovers her fate with Sally's. Sally: Whitman's young daughter, Alan cares greatly for Sally and assumes care of her when Isobel departs from the group they are traversing in. She is later missing, with Alan later discovering her fate alongside Isobel's. Lateef: The leader of the group of refugees Alan and his family join, his and the group's origins are unknown. Tregarth: He is referred to by Alan several times, explaining his early political history and actions concerning the afrim landings and their subsequent treatment. He is revealed to have originally been an independent MP with strong ultranationalist and protectionist ideological leanings. He later assumes power as prime minister by electing his third party at the general election and gaining a majority within parliament. He becomes an authoritarian leader quickly after the election and exerts executive power with little regard to civil liberties. = Factions = Nationalists: The ruling power, led by Tregarth who takes a hardline approach to the arrival of the afrims. The faction consolidated its power after the election of Tregarth, who uses executive powers with little regards to civil liberties. Secessionists: The main opposition to the nationalist forces. They are known to promote integration with afrims and take a much more liberal approach to the social issues of the conflict. The faction was primarily created by the defection from the army, navy, air force and police forces. Afrims: The immigrants from Africa, which have been fleeing the state of turmoil on the continent due to the use of nuclear weapons and covert foreign intervention by major powers. It is this exodus of people which catalyses the civil war. Some afrims choose to side with Secessionists, whereas others remain within the homogenous group. Welfare groups/red cross: Throughout the novel, different welfare organisations including the red cross are mentioned. The group at times helps various refugees, playing a purely humanitarian role in the conflict and helps displaced groups in need. Unites States: The only reference to the United States in relation to the conflict is the detachment of marines sent as an advisory force to the nationalist side. Implying the united states is backing the nationalists in the war. United Nations: The U.N has peacekeeping forces present on the island, which occasionally intervene in the conflict but overall have little to no effect on the progression of the war. Other nations: Other world powers including Russia and China are mentioned and it is implied they are selling arms to certain factions in the conflict as proxies.

Omony is studying for a bachelor's degree in Communications and Culture from the University of Calgary. In early 2017, Omony made allegations of racial profiling against members of the Calgary Police Service after being pulled over on suspicion of impaired driving. Her claims were proven false with video evidence that she was driving erratically and that she failed to stop for over 20 blocks for a marked police vehicle with lights and sirens. It was proven that the officers in question treated her in a professional, courteous manner, that her claims were categorically false and that she was attempting to enflame racial tension between visible minorities and the C.P.S. She later deleted her inflammatory posts and offered an apology.

Biography  Sitarane was born into a family of witch doctors in the Portuguese possessions of Mozambique. He arrived on the island of R√©union in 1889 at the age of 30 to work under contract as an indentured labourer on land belonging to a Mr Morange in Saint-Beno√Æt, having been assigned the ticket number 10 8958. Two years later, he left this employment and went underground. In 1906, he met two other criminals: Pierre-Elie Calendrin (1869‚Äì1937), the leader of the gang, who had a reputation as a witch doctor, and Emmanuel Fontaine (1886‚Äì1911), with whom he committed numerous acts of theft, some of which were undertaken in a mysterious and audacious way, and then three murders, where the victims' throats were cut during their sleep (it is claimed, however, that they were responsible for around a dozen murders). The trio terrorised the inhabitants of Saint-Pierre until their arrest in 1909, along with around ten accomplices. The investigation also revealed that the three bandits had drunk and collected the blood of their victims as part of Calendrin's occult practices. Calendrin himself denied everything at the trial and was handed a sentence of forced labour for the rest of his life. The two others were sentenced to death and were sent to the guillotine. Just before his execution, Sitarane asked to be baptised. Influence Curiously, only the name Sitarane remains alive in local folklore and history, and today his grave - bedecked with flowers and candles - is the focus of a genuine cult. According to the tradition of witchcraft on the island, many sorcerers call upon Sitarane's spirit when performing black magic. It is also claimed that anyone planning a crime or a hold-up, or who is planning to misappropriate inheritance or murder their mother-in-law, prays at the grave of Sitarane at night so that his evil spirit might help them in their plans. A story is still told of a man who, one night, left a butcher's knife at Sitarane's grave and then used it to murder his mistress who was watching a variety show in the square in front of the town hall with ten thousand other people. It was the same cult that led No√´l Clarel, a labourer working on archaeological digs at Pointe du Diable (a cape near Saint-Pierre), to take an 11-year-old child to a ravine and then strangle him. While undertaking his own digs at night in the hope of discovering the treasure that was supposedly hidden there, Clarel believed that finding it depended on sacrificing a child. French author and historian Daniel Vaxelaire has written at least two books on the subject of Sitarane.Vaxelaire, Daniel. Les buveurs de sang, ou la v√©ritable histoire de Sitarane. Orphie, 2008.Vaxelaire, Daniel. Saint Ange et Sitarane : Les buveurs de sang. Orphie, 2011. His (mythological) history based on what was related in his judgement was released in 2012.

Transition to Artist In 1988 at the age of 35, Jon suddenly developed tinnitus, a ringing in the ears caused by a blood vessel in his head pushing against an acoustic nerve, as well as hyperacusis, an over-sensitivity to certain frequency ranges of sound. In 1989, to alleviate the condition, he underwent surgery after which he suffered a cerebellar hemorrhage and a subsequent stroke.Edgers, Geoff. \\"A Changed Man.\\" The Boston Globe June 11, 2006 Jon awoke from the surgery deaf in one ear, his vision splintered, and his balance permanently skewed. Neurologists told him his brain had been permanently changed through the surgery, with parts sliced and removed to alleviate the condition.

Sarkin became obsessed with drawing, but different from the kinds of focused sketches he had made before the stroke. Instead of the visual jokes and puns he drew before, his new works were akin to distorted cartoon faces with symbols that sometimes overlapped the features, much like Jean Giraud's Moebius strips.

Beyer Peacock suggested a tank engine as it would be ready earlier and could go fast backwards as opposed to a tender engine which could not. They arrived between 1912 and 1925 with a total of 14 engines produced. These served alongside Richmond Vale Railway's ROD 2-8-0s and Kitsons, and New South Wales Government Railways locomotives. Also made by Beyer Peacock was the SMR 15 class which was a copy of the NSWGR 30 Class. Numbers 15 and 16 were built in 1912 and No 29 in 1923. These were initially used for passenger services but when that stopped they pulled coal for the rest of their lives. All were scrapped in late 1973. The Kitson locomotives were known on the Richmond Vale Railway as the 9-11 Class. Locomotives 9,10 and 11 were tank locomotives and had the appearance of a side tank version of an ROD 2-8-0. Numbers 9 and 10 ended their careers on the RVR's Hexham washery shunt and the short trip to Stockrington Colliery. No 9 was originally called Pelaw Main and 10 was called Richmond Main. No 11 was called Hexham.

Locomotives 24 and 25 were restored to steam at the RVRM where they worked until the late 1990s. No 24 and 25 were withdrawn because their boilers must be lifted from the frames and the frames inspected. Locomotive No. 30 was returned to steam in April 2000 and worked until 2009. No 30 was withdrawn because it is in bad mechanical condition. The RVRM's current plan is to put No. 30's boiler into No. 24's frame to accelerate its return it to steam.

In 2009 it was taken to the RVRM where it is now displayed. =ROD Class= ROD No 23's Boiler stored at the Richmond Vale Railway Museum A total of 521 ROD locomotives were built and three are preserved, all in New South Wales: * No 23, withdrawn as No 21 is at Richmond Vale Railway Museum and is in a dismantled state after a stalled restoration attempt. * Nos 20 and 24 are stored Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum.

The Solution won the 1930 Thompson Trophy race days. Design and development In 1930 Matty Laird was commissioned to build a racing plane based on the Laird Speedwing by B.F. Goodrich's Lee Schoenhair for the 1930 Thompson Trophy race. Schoenhair backed out of the project, believing the aircraft would not be tested in time. Laird entered the Solution himself in the 1930 Thompson Trophy with Charles \\"Speed\\" Holman as the pilot. The Solution, (registered NR10538), was a biplane with conventional landing gear, having a welded steel fuselage and aircraft fabric covering. The aircraft kept the same registration number NR10538, and was repainted several times from black and gold, white and gold, to lavender and gold. A second aircraft, (NR12048), powered by a 535 hp Pratt & Whitney Wasp was built as the LC-DW300 Super Solution, retaining the fixed undercarriage of the original, for the 1931 Bendix Trophy which it won, piloted by Jimmy Doolittle. This aircraft was modified with retractable landing gear for the 1932 Bendix Trophy but on a test flight the gear failed to lower and Doolittle was forced to belly land the aircraft, forcing withdrawal from the race.

Main characters =Rex Salazar= * Voice Actor: Daryl Sabara Rex Salazar is a 16 yr old half-Argentinean, half-Mexican, human E.V.O born to a family of scientists. Unlike other E.V.O.s, Rex can control his nanites at will, allowing him to cure other E.V.O.s of their mutations and use his nanites to create a variety of machines on his body and communicate with a variety of machines. Rex is overconfident, impulsive, and typically, rebellious. He has a quick wit and is constantly making jokes. However, when Rex needs to defend himself, he doesn't hold back. He prefers to smash anything that gets in his way. Despite this, Rex has also shown a selfless side to his personality, as he has cured E.V.O.s even at his own risk. Prior to the Nanite Event, Rex was critically injured in an industrial accident caused by a dispute between the many scientists about how the nanites were to be used. The scientists injected Rex with the original batch of fully programmed nanites, hoping to save Rex's life and to make the other scientists see that their ways were for the greater good. However, Rex's new abilities, courtesy of the nanites, only reinforced their beliefs. While Rex, Gabriel, and Caesar were able to survive the Nanite Event by sheer blind luck, Rafael and Violetta died as a result of the massive nanite explosion and Rex lost his memories. Rex seemingly traveled the world, ending up as a leader of a small gang in Hong Kong and a lieutenant to a crime boss. A few years later, around age 14, Rex transformed into a giant bio-mechanical form and went on a rampage in Mexico. Providence sent a group of soldiers, including Six and White Knight, to contain the menace. After sustaining heavy damage, Rex crashed into a building and reverted to his human form, forgetting everything that happened before he turned full E.V.O. Six discovered him beneath the wreckage and helped him to safety. After that, he was accepted at Providence after he showed his ability to heal E.V.O.s. As Rex lived in Providence, he came to see it as his home and developed tight bonds with the people there, particularly Agent Six, Dr. Holiday and Bobo, openly acknowledging them as his family. After finding his older brother Caesar, Rex was glad to have found a family member, however, he admitted that he wasn't as happy as he thought he would be. He declared that the people in Providence - Six, Holiday and Bobo - were the ones he really had a family-like connection with. Like all living beings on Earth, Rex has nanites bonded to him on a molecular level. Having activated nanites makes him an E.V.O., however, unlike most E.V.O.s, Rex has the ability to control his nanites at will, allowing him to do such things like communicate and control technology by interfacing it. He also control nanites from other E.V.O.s, curing them by extracting their activated nanites. However, some E.V.O.s, are incurables, having nanites that are completely resistant to curing. Additionally, Rex has a limit to how many nanites from cured E.V.O.s he can carry. Rex's E.V.O. powers come in the form of \\"builds\\" a variety of machine enhancements his nanites can generate seemingly out of thin air. Even without his machines, Rex appears to have superhuman durability; on numerous occasions he's survived situations well beyond the limits of normal humans, like being thrown through walls. In addition, Rex was the only person at hand who could survive the fatal G forces of a 'space elevator' in the episode \\"Gravity\\". He is also, notably, shown to take several punches (and a few kicks) in the gut from a temporarily powerless Breach's more human pair of hands, displaying no signs of pain whatsoever. =Agent Six= * Voice Actor: Wally Kurth Agent Six is a senior Providence agent and Rex's handler. His name came from the fact that he is the sixth most dangerous person in the planet. Due to Six's strict by-the-book personality, Rex goes as far as to refer to him as a \\"nanny, just more aggro\\". He always wears a green suit with a black tie and black sunglasses. As noted, Six likes to continually wear the same suit. It was shown that Six had brown eyes. He was born and raised in an unnamed town in China, near Beijing, which would later be overrun by E.V.O. bugs in the episode \\"The Swarm\\". He was homeless at some point in his life and during that time \\"One\\" (the most dangerous person in the planet) took him in and trained him. He later joined \\"The Six\\", a group of mercenaries, the six most dangerous persons in the planet that was led by One, and eventually, Six left the group. He later revealed that there was a time when he wanted to be number One and that he was well on his way until he met Rex. Six believed that his work for Providence was more important than his original work. Six has an extremely stoic personality, often keeping a stern look on his face. Despite his emotionless exterior, he is a caring person deep down. It is implied that Six was not given the title of One (or any higher) because of the softer side of his personality, which made him less of a threat than the others. Six rigidly believes that orders are orders and that they must be obeyed even if one doesn't like them. However, Agent Six isn't without morals. For example, when White Knight was going to use a Bleach Bomb to stop zombie E.V.O.s from crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, Six removed the detonation key, effectively disobeying White Knight's orders. In an attempt to cheer Rex up, Six offered to buy Rex a few more days in Cabo Luna, despite the vacation not being authorized. Six also offered Rex the choice of leaving Providence. Additionally, he tricked White Knight into thinking he, Rex and Doctor Holiday would return on \\"The Keep\\". In \\"Six minus Six\\", after losing the last six years of his memories at a failure attempt of Caesar to restore Rex's memories, Six acts more like the mercenary he once was. He became more aggressive, cocky, merciless, irresponsible, sarcastic, as well as a bit of a loner. He is much more flirtatious towards Dr. Holiday and toward Five, to a lesser extent. After deciding to try to become the man everyone knows, Six started to act a little more like his responsible self but still acts more on the \\"mercenary\\" side of his personality. He is skilled in martial arts. He wields a pair of \\"Magna blades\\" that can slice through most materials with ease and he stores them in his sleeves. These swords can also be used as a powerful magnet when joined together, forming a shape similar to a tuning fork. Six is also proficient in the art of knife throwing and still has formidable fighting skills when battling with a single katana. He is also very knowledgeable of Providence's rules and codes, most likely because of his by- the-book personality. He has peak human agility and speed. His skills are clearly seen when, after jumping out of a Providence carrier, he unsheathed his swords and performed a series of acrobatic feats. He sliced through boulder-sized chunks of debris in mid-air, jumping from each of them, and they wouldn't fall onto the civilians below‚Äîall before he touched the ground. Six's reflexes are fast enough that he can deflect point blank gunfire with his katana. =Bobo Haha= * Voice Actor: John DiMaggio Bobo Haha is an E.V.O. chimp with the ability to speak. He is also Rex's sidekick and friend. He wears an eye patch and fez. Bobo also claimed that before he was turned into an E.V.O., he was a helper animal trained to entertain children at a hospital. His owner was supposedly an eccentric philanthropist. He is a fun-loving guy, always up to having a good time, and has a particular love for gambling. Bobo's good-hearted fun causes Providence to view him as a bad influence on Rex, since he encourages his rebellious tendencies. He is quick to fire his weapon in battle, preferring not to think about the variables. Despite close friends, he shows a general dislike for humans, whom he refers to as \\"sheep\\" because they seem to blindly follow the crowd. Aside from his human-level intelligence and the ability to talk, he seems to be a completely normal chimpanzee. He also wields a pair of rather large laser pistols in combat. He is apparently knowledgeable of codes used by Providence, information about locations, and is able to fly a variety of military grade aircraft as well as use a variety of military grade weapons. His swinging, balancing and jumping capabilities are that of a typical jungle-variety chimpanzee. Bobo has super- human strength, like a normal chimpanzee. Despite his attitude problems and gangster personality, Bobo Haha has shown himself to be techno-savvy and intelligent enough to create a fully functional android to pose as him while on his \\"Bobo-time\\". =Rebecca Holiday= * Voice Actress: Grey DeLisle Rebecca Holiday is the lead scientist for Providence, a position she earned due to her expertise in nanotechnology. Along with Agent Six, she is responsible for taking care of Rex. She takes her job very seriously, constantly monitoring Rex to ensure his safety. Her younger sister, Beverly, became an incurable and extremely dangerous E.V.O at thirteen. In the early days of Providence, Holiday served as a medical assistant to Dr. Fell. It is implied that Holiday joined Providence in exchange for the guarantee of her sister's safety. However, she was against Providence's protocol for handling E.V.O.s, which was to contain or destroy them. Although she had no authority in the matter, she believed that finding a cure was another alternative. On the day that Six found Rex and his ability to cure E.V.O.s, he showed Rex to Holiday, who was overjoyed with the discovery, but promised Six not to tell White Knight, who, at this point, only intended to kill E.V.O.s. Unfortunately, White Knight was mysteriously able to get her to confess, and locked her in a cage to prevent Rex's dissection from being stopped. Later, Dr. Fell was fired by Providence following his attempt to dissect Rex and was soon replaced by Dr. Holiday. Holiday is the polar opposite of Agent Six, as she is much more in-tune with her emotions. Although she can be short-tempered and stubborn at times, she is a deeply caring person. Her stubbornness can also lead to determination. Holiday is also not afraid to speak her mind in front of her superiors, especially when she believes she has a better solution to a problem. She is also a very empathetic person. She's frequently expressed concern over the fact that Providence sees Rex only as a weapon, and not as a sixteen-year-old teenager. She repeatedly tries to convince Six to try to relate with Rex, as she understands what he goes through with his amnesia and the pressure put on him by Providence. Rex frequently flirts with Holiday despite the fact that she is much older than him. While she is widely aware of his crush on her, she mostly ignores him. Later, Rex realizes this fact and stops. Six, on the advice of Rex, later asked her out on a date, which she gladly accepted. Following Six's memory loss, Holiday was a little unnerved by his more aggressive romantic overtures (such as the pick-up lines), though it is confirmed in further episodes that her feelings toward him have remained the same. This is evident in the season three episode, 'Ben 10/Generator Rex : Heroes United,' when she kneels beside Six, who is in a comatose state, and kisses the glass of the chamber he is in. Holiday also exhibits adequate fighting ability and a strong capability with Providence weapons, evident when she dove in front of gunfire aimed at Rex and Six while fighting E.V.O.s in Abysus. In the episode 'Payback,' Six handed Holiday a Providence gun, to defend herself against the Pack and Van Kleiss. In the Petting Zoo, Holiday is cornered by Skalamander, but being resourceful, she unleashes her sister, Beverly, who chases Skalamander away. =Noah Nixon= * Voice Actor: Fred Savage Noah Nixon is a human and Rex's best friend. In the beginning it was revealed that he is an agent sent by White Knight to befriend Rex and subtly influence his decisions to make him more compliant. Noah eventually revealed to Rex his status as a covert agent and they became friends on open terms. Being best friends and having many similar interests, Noah isn't too different from Rex. Besides being very competitive against one another, Noah has shown to be more of a mature and responsible teenager than Rex. Although his normal job was to keep an eye on Rex as a spy for White Knight, Noah seems to do it perfectly fine on his own on any occasion, and tends to be a voice of reason. He also displays a bit of loyalty and bravery since he is ready to fight whenever trouble brews around the two. Noah is a normal human: however he has taken a kick-boxing class in and he's received basic Providence training. On several occasions, he has been shown proficient enough with Providence weaponry. Noah is shown to be a star Ping-Pong player, short of Rex who enrolled in his school for one week. Noah's main love interest is Claire Bowman, a girl that he originally asks to the Prom. She is only willing to go with him if he can find a date for her clumsy friend, Amy, and so Rex becomes his wingman. In the episode 'Haunted', Noah's feelings toward Claire are confirmed. Rex sets up a date to watch a scary movie with the two girls, Noah and himself, but this ultimately fails when both girls cling to Rex. Further into the date, when in a haunted house supposedly 'rigged' by Rex's brother Caesar, it is discovered that an actual 'ghost' E.V.O. is responsible for some of the occurrences. When the E.V.O. attacks, Rex pushes Noah and Claire into an elevator, but the E.V.O. slams into the doors and crushes them shut. In the elevator, it is revealed that Claire is claustrophobic, and so Noah comforts her by talking to her and keeping her calm. When Rex eventually opens the doors, Noah has his arm around Claire's shoulders. Towards the end of the date, Noah and Claire almost kiss, but are interrupted by the presence of Caesar, whereby Claire and Amy begin to question him about the technology he used to create some of the illusions. =White Knight= * Voice Actor: J. K. Simmons White Knight is the leader of Providence. He also is the only known nanite-free being on the planet: he almost always stays in his white sterile office, communicating his orders only through two-way screens. He has a Mysophobia-like fear of nanites, he doesn't want to touch or even be near E.V.O.s because he fears they'll infect him with nanites. At least 6 years ago, White and Six were working together as mercenaries. Most likely at Six's suggestion, the duo went to work for Providence. Several years later, White and Six were called in to halt the rampage of a giant Bio-Mechanical E.V.O. Much to White's shock, Six had rescued a young Rex in the area where the E.V.O. had rampaged, and would later discover that they were one and the same. The additional discovery that Rex had the ability to cure other E.V.O.s prompted White to kidnap him and bring him to the head of R&D; Dr. Fell to have him reverse-engineer Rex's powers. Six and White got into a fight over the life of Rex which had accidentally overloaded the molecular disassembling chamber that was being used to study him. White rescued Six and brought him to safety but he was caught in the destruction of the machine. Rex deactivated the machine before it killed him, and the accident stripped him of his nanites. White Knight was then promoted to leader of Providence. His nanite- free condition made him \\"the perfect poster boy for the operation\\", as he put it, but as a consequence he was trapped in a sterile nanite free environment for the rest of his life to prevent reinfection with them. However, despite saving his life, White would never forget the monster that Rex was when he was found and began construction of a Weapon Zed Hazmat suit to kill him if he ever turned back. He is cold and ruthless when it comes to achieving his goals: White seems to favor violence to get the job done. He views most of his soldiers, including Rex, as expendable weapons. When his soldiers act out of line, he's not above threatening them. He even threatened to eliminate Rex if Six could not learn to control him better. As a boss, White Knight is tirelessly difficult-to-please, demanding and critical and verbally rejects all or essentially all objections to his leadership style. White Knight has also been shown to be manipulative. He hired Noah to spy on and influence Rex: although Rex eventually discovered the truth about Noah, he still decided to be Noah's friend. This implies that White Knight is trying to indirectly control Rex's life. White Knight has both a fear and hatred of E.V.O.s and nanites. Over the years, he's seen that nanites typically turn humans and animals into mindless, rampaging beasts: thus, he doesn't trust anything with nanites, namely every living thing on the planet. Furthermore, his own lack of nanites makes him feel like he's the only person on Earth that can be trusted. At times, he demonstrates a slightly sadistic behavior toward E.V.O.s. On one occasion, White Knight emerged from his office wearing a pressurized suit that protected him from all nanites. It also greatly enhanced his strength, reflexes and agility tenfold, and had limited self-repairing capabilities. Also it was revealed that he had constructed a giant mech-like robot, specifically designed to combat E.V.O.s, specifically Rex if he ever went out of control. The robot is piloted by a person inside. It has a large arsenal of weapons, greatly enhances White Knight's strength, and has flight capabilities. However, it was destroyed after battling Rex, and it was rebuilt before he was replaced as head of Providence by Black Knight. =Caesar Salazar= * Voice Actor: Freddy Rodriguez Caesar Salazar is Rex's older brother and one of the surviving scientists of the Nanite Project. Alongside his parents, Caesar started the nanite research team in Abysus. During the research, the scientists divided into groups, each having different ideas about how to use the power coming from the nanites. During the Nanite Project, Caesar created two Artificial Intelligences that later went rogue and threatened all life on earth; the decontamination program ZAG-RS and the control nanite Alpha. Due to the unfortunate event, ten-year-old Rex was gravely hurt and only an infusion of nanites could save him. Yet the successful operation did not convince the others to change their plans. One of the scientists sabotaged the project, which caused a massive explosion, and it was Rex's new powers (which were, most likely, a side-effect of the previous infusion) that saved Caesar and Rex during the Nanite Event. Van Kleiss claimed it was Caesar who caused the event. Just before the explosion, he fled to his research pod and activated its subspace engines to get away. The engines were super charged and launched the pod into orbit at super speeds. The speed he was traveling at was so great that in the fifteen minutes it took to take control over the machine, five years had gone by on the rest of the planet. Caesar's personality is akin to that of a mad scientist, coming off to Rex and the others as a tad out of whack from reality. Yet he seems to be aware of his own eccentricities as demonstrated when Rex asked him. Although having no amnesia, Caesar has an information gap due to his five-year absence in sub-speed caused by the explosion blast at the Abysus research facility. He occasionally talks off subject, easily distracted and does not seem to listen when spoken to directly and is sometimes forgetful in daily activities. Caesar is also very upbeat, curious and quite over-protective of his younger brother. In fact, it seems some of Caesar's less \\"weird\\" traits are shared with Rex, such as his sense of humor and loyalty. He seems to be fearless, as long as science is involved, as he was not afraid of the mutations due to his work on nanites. As he had previously mentioned, he and his colleagues had expected mutations, but nothing like the present E.V.O.s. He stood in front of many without worrying about being harmed. Thus far, it seems that he is generally not afraid of anything, as made apparent by not only the E.V.O. situations, but the way he barged into Providence without prior worry. Aside for science, he also isn't afraid to go up against stronger men like Agent Six or Hunter Cain to defend Rex even though he is not technically a combatant or Rex doesn't necessarily need help. In \\"Black and White\\", Rex encounters C√©sar during White Knight's raid, where he has been put in charge of starting the second Nanite Event in the hopes of restoring Dr. Gabriel Rylander (whose residual energy was found by Providence). He had tried to explain to a positively angered Rex, that he had only started the original Nanite Event in an attempt to save the world. In \\"End Game\\" Pt. 2, it is finally revealed that Caesar along with his parents were, in fact, the saboteurs of the Nanite Project, as they wanted to keep the Consortium from gaining the Meta-Nanites for their plan of conquest. Antagonists =Van Kleiss= * Voice Actor: Troy Baker Van Kleiss is the primary antagonist of the series. Van Kleiss appears to know quite a bit about Rex, and knows what caused the nanite incident. He saw the nanite incident as the dawn of a new age for humanity, and seeks to create a planet populated solely by E.V.O.s. Like Rex, he is able to control his nanites; unlike Rex, however, his mutation is unstable and requires a constant supply of fresh nanites, extracted from other E.V.O.s, who are petrified in the process. He does this with needles on his gauntlet that go into the E.V.O. With his E.V.O. enforcers, the Pack, he has established a domain called Abysus at the original site of the nanite explosion, and has seeded nanites for miles in the area. As a result, he can control everything in his sphere of influence, and even regenerate completely from the ground if his body is destroyed. He has a highly extensive knowledge of the nanites, having apparently worked on or been familiar with the experiment which released them, and about Rex's past. He is killed in \\"Dark Passage\\" while attempting to secure Dr. Gabriel Rylander's nanite laboratory, but is resurrected in \\"What Lies Beneath\\" by his followers and Rex, to prevent Abysus from becoming unstable. Rex cures him shortly thereafter. In doing so, however, he gives Van Kleiss the means to study his nanites, which Van Kleiss then uses to gain the power to create E.V.O.s by touch, leaving a handprint- mark. E.V.O.s created by Van Kleiss are extremely unstable, meaning that the transformation becomes permanent if not cured within a time limit. Curiously, in the first season finale \\"Payback\\", when Van Kleiss drained Rex of his active nanites, Rex wasn't petrified. This was most likely because Van Kleiss was not able to absorb the Omega-One nanite that Dr. Rylander had injected into Rex, thus protecting him from becoming petrified like Van Kleiss' other victims. In \\"Lions and Lambs\\", Van Kleiss attaches a device to Breach in a plot to travel through time. When Breach ends up sending Van Kleiss away in a bright golden-colored time portal, Breach starts to disappear as Rex is mysteriously transported six months into the future where Providence is run by a woman called Black Knight. In \\"A Brief History of Time,\\" it is later revealed that Van Kleiss was sent 4000 years into the past and began working to return to the present all the while pursued by an unknown entity that he believed sought to destroy him. His journey took him through multiple eras, such as the Roman Empire (during the reign of Septimius Severus) and an unknown Japanese era. When he is found by Rex and Providence, he has grown a beard and seemingly been driven to the brink of insanity by his ordeal. He was knocked out by Bobo Haha and taken away by Providence. He also has unknown connections with Black Knight when she appeared where Van Kleiss was placed. In \\"End Game\\" Pt. 2, it is revealed that Van Kleiss had the same objective as the Consortium and wanted power to himself and believed that the nanites could help achieve that. He also murdered Rex's parents once they caused the explosion after discovering the same thing. During the final cure, he is dragged by Breach into one of her wormholes. His fate is unknown. The name Van Klei(ss) is Dutch for \\"Of clay,\\" which could be a reference to his original nature/earth-controlling abilities. =The Pack= The Pack is a group of E.V.O.s that serve Van Kleiss. Its known members include the following: Biowulf * Voice Actor: Troy Baker Biowulf is a blue-armored, white- haired, werewolf-like E.V.O. with enormous claws, who is fiercely loyal to Van Kleiss, whom he calls \\"master.\\" Due to Van Kleiss' powers being limited to his native soil in early episodes, Biowulf initially acts as the Pack's de facto leader in the field. He is captured in \\"Payback\\" during the assault on Providence's base, but is apparently freed by Breach. He is extremely loyal and faithful to his master, despite Van Kleiss tiring of his constant failures. In \\"Assault on Abysus,\\" Biowulf is shown to have taken over the pack after what happened to Van Kleiss. He and the other E.V.O.s that served Van Kleiss end up helping Rex find the Meta-Nanite at the same time when Black Knight's men attacked Abysus. Biowulf and Circe managed to buy Rex some time to get away with the Meta-Nanite resulting in their capture. Skalamander * Voice Actor: John DiMaggio Skalamander is a large humanoid lizard-like E.V.O. with crystal spikes growing out of his body, four short stubby legs and a crystal club growing out of his left arm. His head appears to be permanently twisted to its side. He can fire spikes out of his club or grow it into a shield. In \\"Payback,\\" Skalamander took part in Van Kleiss' attack on Providence. He had Dr. Holiday cornered until she unleashed her sister on him. He was presumably captured and later rescued by Breach. In \\"Assault on Abysus,\\" Skalamander and the E.V.O.s that served Van Kleiss end up assisting Rex into finding the Meta-Nanite at the same time when Black Knight's men attacked Abysus. Skalamander ends up captured by Black Knight's men. =ZAG-RS= * Voice Actress: Grey DeLisle ZAG-RS is a sentient and autonomous, self-aware artificial intelligence/multi-agent system whose goal is to destroy the nanite infestation of Earth. Its origin and motives are initially left mysterious, but it is able to exert control over the nanites at very short ranges. It makes several different attempts to achieve its goal. Its methods have in common that they would also destroy everything infected with nanites, including all organic life on Earth, a prospect to which ZAG-RS is apparently indifferent. The AI has no permanent form, being a program capable of uploading itself into computers and autonomous devices. It speaks in a synthesized female voice. In \\"The Architect\\", ZAG-RS attempts to transmit a self-destruct command to all nanites on Earth. Rex manages to destroy its broadcast antenna, but the AI escapes by uploading its program to a new location. In \\"Gravity\\", ZAG-RS infiltrates a Providence space station in order to secure a strain of nanite-disabling nanites that it had secretly helped develop. Rex and Dr. Holiday are able to deorbit the station, destroying the nanites. In \\"Written in Sand\\", Rex and Van Kleiss separately arrive in a desert location to investigate a mysterious sandstorm, and find themselves trapped in a network of nanite-annihilating tunnels created by ZAG-RS. Van Kleiss reveals that ZAG-RS dates to the Nanite Project, having originally been a decontamination program designed by Caesar to contain and eliminate stray nanites. In addition to the tunnels, ZAG-RS had spent the time since its fall from orbit constructing a giant robotic form for itself, which Rex and Van Kleiss fight and defeat. Later, Caesar admits that ZAG-RS had indeed been his creation. He brings its damaged hardware back online so it can be interrogated, but while it recognizes Caesar, it appears to have been reformatted and its memory wiped. After Rex mocks the AI for its \\"GPS lady voice,\\" Caesar reveals that he had modeled ZAG-RS' voice after that of their deceased Mexican mother Violetta. =Agent Weaver= * Voice Actor: Troy Baker Agent Weaver is a former member of Providence stationed at the arctic \\"Paradise\\" base where he was the chief technician. He and his crew were revealed to be traitors who were reactivating and selling nanites to Van Kleiss. In \\"Frostbite\\", he accidentally turned himself into a monstrous 50-foot, tentacled E.V.O. after he unintentionally destabilized the containment unit. When Rex was unable to fully cure him due to the excessive amount of nanites he absorbed, Weaver was defeated by Agent Six and knocked down when Dr. Holiday rammed the ship into him. In \\"Basic\\", it was revealed that Weaver was extracted from the arctic and locked up in the E.V.O.-Fighting Cage at the Providence Training Camp. Due to a malfunction caused by a jealous Kenwyn Jones, Weaver and the other E.V.O.s got out. Weaver remembered Rex during his fight with the E.V.O.s. Rex managed to knock Weaver back into the pit. =Hunter Cain= * Voice Actor: John Cena (1st Time), John DiMaggio (2nd Time) Hunter Cain is an E.V.O. hunter who despises all E.V.O.s under all circumstances as he went insane after his wife became E.V.O. He uses a weapon loaded with special bullets that forces Nanites to self-destruct, vaporizing an E.V.O in an instant. First appearing in \\"The Hunter\\", he disrupts Rex from curing an E.V.O. and damages Providence's reputation by claiming that they lied to the public for years. Hunter Cain states E.V.O.s are created by diseases spread from person to person rather than the Nanites. Rex is soon defamed after being attacked by civilians and injuring one accidentally. Later in the episode, a swarm of Phantom-like E.V.O.s attack the docks, which Cain's private army dispatches. After Rex arrives and fights Cain one-on-one in a secluded area, the Hunter reveals that he had cloned the Phantom E.V.O.s to create his army and prove Providence's ineffectiveness. The whole statement was caught on News. After a rough battle, Rex ties up Cain and leaves him for Providence to arrest, and his not-so loyal army disbands at the end of the episode. Hunter Cain returns in \\"Night Falls\\" along with a new army where he is hired by Mayor Esteban to dispatch Rex's adoptive family who suddenly turn into Werewolf-like E.V.O.s during the night. Hunter Cain informs Rex that he ran out of his special bullets replacing them with regular ones that \\"hurt just as bad.\\" During the skirmish between the E.V.O.s and Cain's army, Hunter Cain reveals that he escaped Providence using \\"cold hard cash\\" as \\"not everyone in Providence are E.V.O. lovers\\" Hunter Cain is eventually chased off by the Werewolf-like E.V.O.s, and Rex remarks that they will be ready for his return. In \\"Enemies Mine,\\" Hunter freed and formed an alliance with Gatlocke, Valve, and NoFace to find and kill Rex. He, along with his three cohorts, was trapped in a large dome-shaped barrier created by Rex's surplus nanites. =NoFace= * Voice Actor: Fred Tatasciore NoFace is a supremely powerful and vengeful faceless E.V.O. with the ability to communicate with intelligent E.V.O.s and control the less intelligent ones. During the nanite event, the Gulf Stream funneled a huge amount of active nanites into the city of Kiev, Ukraine, transforming nearly all that lived there into extremely powerful E.V.O.s. Among them was their current leader, NoFace. In response to the chaos, all humans were evacuated and the city quarantined via a massive one- way spherical force field. In \\"The Forgotten\\", NoFace spotted Captain Callan's ship and shot it down, forcing Calan and his crew to try and repair it, hoping to use it to escape the city with the data rod containing important information to Providence. NoFace knew they would send in more ships to retrieve the rod and would continue to shoot them down until he had the means of escaping. His plot failed due to Rex's interference and a self-destruct device Calan had secret planted in the ship he repaired. NoFace has alluded to something called \\"the before\\", and during a battle with Rex he said \\"You are not the before\\". It is currently unknown what this means, it might mean the people before their transformations. In \\"Alliance\\", Van Kleiss and the Pack infiltrated the Bug Jar in order to form an alliance with NoFace. After Circe captures Rex, NoFace agrees to join Van Kleiss if he is allowed to humiliate Rex. Van Kleiss agrees, and NoFace takes Rex to an arena, where he severely beats him up. However, when Van Kleiss refused to let NoFace kill Rex because he still needed him \\"alive\\", he and his E.V.O.s attacked the Pack, severing ties with Van Kleiss and the Pack. =Quarry= * Voice Actor: Mark Hamill (1st Time), John DiMaggio (2nd Time) Quarry is an E.V.O. crime lord who is made of rock. He would hunt down and force E.V.O.s like Tuck, Skwydd, and Cricket to work for him through having gathered a massive criminal empire. In \\"Rabble\\", he learned of Rex's return from his enforcer Knuckles after Rex drained him of his nanites. Quarry had to dispose of Knuckles after that. He later revealed that once upon a time Rex was his top lieutenant and he traded Tuck, Cricket, and Skwydd, whom he had befriended, for his freedom. His defeat came at the hands of Rex, who now had no idea about his past including his dealings with Quarry and showed no mercy in defeating him, in the process regaining the trust and friendship of the three E.V.O.s he had betrayed. He is sneaky and deceitful and some say he lied about Rex's betrayal to keep his power. Rex managed to defeat Quarry and his loyal E.V.O. servants and he was then arrested by Providence. In \\"Hard Target,\\" Van Kleiss has Breach spring Quarry from his imprisonment only for him to trick Breach into telling him about the dangerous ultimate weapon Van Kleiss wants him to steal and steals it for himself. Rex defeats Quarry and trades him to Breach in exchange for Circe, who Breach had kidnapped earlier. Breach takes Quarry to Van Kleiss, and he can take the blame for her \\"failure.\\" In \\"Remote Control,\\" Quarry was shown to have some cybernetics holding his rocky body together after what he had endured at the hands of Van Kleiss. When Providence began to promote its E.V.O. Control campaign, Quarry returned to Hong Kong and defeated the Providence soldiers where he confiscated their technology, and he can control Tuck, Skwydd, Cricket, and other E.V.O. hiding out in Hong Kong. This time, Rex was able to defeat Quarry by shattering him. What was left of Quarry was picked up by Providence who also managed to obtain the technology that Quarry was using to control the E.V.O.'s into doing his bidding. =Gatlocke= * Voice Actor: Greg Ellis Gatlocke is a cyborg who is a leader of a group of modern-day pirates known as \\"The Anarchists\\". In \\"Badlands\\", he is introduced spying through an eyeglass down a canyon to an unstable nanite shipment below. After a short pep speech, he gives the order for everyone to attack. With Rex nowhere in sight, Gatlocke and his thieves succeed in taking the convoy with little trouble, not realizing until they're back at base that the \\"unstable nanites\\" they stole were actually toilet paper, a decoy. Gatlocke loses his temper, but a minion reveals that there's another truck; Rex's, which actually has the unstable nanites on board. His minions quickly locate Rex and his crew, right where the last battle's carnage remained. Gatlocke introduces himself to Rex and tries to convince him to join their group, appealing to his hate of rules. He reveals his blades to further \\"persuade\\" him, which backfires. After a very short tussle, Rex and crew jump back into their truck. Then the chase begins. Eventually, Gatlocke crashes Rex's truck, then begins to approach him, giving him a rather merry hug. He asks again for the unstable nanites, saying that he'll split the profits with Rex \\"evenly\\" (60/40), but Rex refuses. After some more bantering and a poor escape plan, Rex throws a can of flat soda claiming that it contains nanites ready to explode which gives him a short head start. Gatlocke and crew catch up with Rex yet again. Rex and Gatlocke begin a rather evenly-matched one-on-one battle on top of the convoy that Gatlocke and his gang hijacked earlier. Gatlocke shoots with his energy canon and loses that hand near the beginning of the fight, but he takes out Rex's Smackhands without much trouble. The battle continues, now with Rex's BFS versus Gatlocke's arm blades: they more-or-less end up at a stalemate. Gatlocke attempts to have Rex join him yet again, which is refused. After some more bickering, Gatlocke states that Rex and he are the same. Rex refutes this with a single fact; that Gatlocke can't fly. Gatlocke, convoy and all, go hurtling down a ravine while Rex escapes on the Boogie Pack. Gatlocke manages to climb back up the ravine with still one hand missing. He demands the unstable nanites, and Rex throws it to him, recently learning and stating that its harsh care made it useless. At this, Gatlocke utterly snaps, screaming at Rex and running at him: receiving a Smackhand to the face. He seems mostly unfazed as Providence soldiers carry him off, most likely to imprison him. =Black Knight= * Voice Actress: Jennifer Hale Black Knight is the next Providence leader after White Knight rebelled against his superiors in the Consortium. When she took over Providence, she started to run things very differently from the way White Knight had. She believes in controlling the uncurable E.V.O.s as rather than trying to cure them (C√©sar is revealed to share a similar belief considering it the most logical conclusion, designing the technology they use to control E.V.O.s). This way, she and her superiors would turn them into little more than obedient slaves. At first, she tries to work with Rex instead of trying to control and manipulate him. But when it becomes clear Rex is against what she and his older brother are doing, she orders C√©sar (who does not hesitate one bit) to use the mind-controlling and brainwashing machine on his younger brother. Before this can be done, Rex is saved from Black Knight's men by Agent Six and Dr. Holiday (who had infiltrated Providence disguised as Black Knight's soldiers). In \\"Riddle of the Sphinx\\", Black Knight obtained some hieroglyphics which mentioned Van Kleiss' involvement in the creation of Gharun Set. In \\"Black and White\\", she and C√©sar planned to start the next Nanite Event in a plan to restore Dr. Gabriel Rylander. During White Knight's raid, she ended up fighting White Knight in the room that used to be White Knight's office. White Knight did obtain a confession from Black Knight that he might use if he is brought before the Consortium. In \\"Deadzone\\", Black Knight and her henchmen failed to obtain a nerdy human E.V.O. called Fitzy Feakins to make E.V.O. capturing much easier and more simpler. This forced her to take much more aggressive action against Rex. In \\"Assault on Abysus\\", Black Knight promotes her E.V.O.-Controlling campaign on TV by capturing any E.V.O.'s that are still free. Her men even managed to capture Tuck, Skwydd, and Cricket when they searched Hong Kong. Black Knight leads her forces to Abysus where the Meta- Nanite is held. Although Rex managed to get away with the Meta-Nanite, Black Knight's men managed to capture Circe, Biowulf, Skalamander, and the other unnamed E.V.O.s that served Van Kleiss. In \\"A Brief History of Time\\", it is shown that Van Kleiss knows about Black Knight when she arrived in the area where the Providence agents had placed him upon apprehending him. In \\"Target: Consortium\\", Black Knight appeared before the Consortium wanting to join them. When Consortium member Vostok had doubt on her nanite project, Black Knight ended up killing Vostok. In \\"End Game\\" Pt. 1, Black Knight gains some E.V.O. abilities upon obtaining the Meta-Nanites. In \\"End Game\\" Pt. 2, a flashback of Rex's shows her in a lab coat at the nanite research facility, implying that she was directly related to the first Nanite Project. Like the other members of the Consortium, Black Knight gets away as she and the Consortium are unaffected by Rex's planet-wide nanite curing. However, it is presumed that she and the Consortium were captured by Providence off-screen. =Valve= * Voice Actor: Maurice LaMarche Valve is a samurai-styled biker and a dealer of an altered form of nanites which can link a person to technology. He sold some of them to some local bikers who would be kept in contrast with their bikes or else the nanites would kill them. He used the nanites on himself, and he can merge with his motorcycle. When Rex traced the nanites that killed his biker friends back to Valve, he challenged Valve to a race to determine the fate of the altered nanites. During the race, Rex managed to defeat Valve. When Valve tried to kill Rex, he easily defeated Valve with his smack hands. =Gharun Set= * Voice Actor: Hakeem Kae-Kazim Technically the first E.V.O. ever created, Gharun Set was an ancient Egyptian created by Van Kleiss when Breach sent him back in time to ancient Egypt. somehow being able to create a nanite production chamber, what Set calls the \\"engines of life\\" Van Kleiss infused them into Gharun Set, changing his appearance into a dog-headed mummy-like humanoid with an eye in the center of his chest. Gharun Set's nanites give him extrodinary powers even when compared to other E.V.O.s. These powers seem to be relating to animating inanimate or dead objects such as mummies and even the great sphinx which turned into a monster under Set's control. Set's nanites gave him great longevity but eventually began to die during his awakening, causing him to turn to dust. Van Kleiss (who he refers to as father) told Set about Rex and how neither of them belonged in the world. In \\"A Brief History of Time\\", it was shown that Gharun Set had helped Van Kleiss build his time machine which he used to get back to the present. =The Consortium= The Consortium is a powerful organization which supports Providence and are the superiors of Black Knight. Little is known about this organization, but they seem to provide funding for Providence and the Nanite Project. In \\"End Game\\" Pt. 1, the Consortium gets injected with the Meta- Nanites, enabling them to gain different, powerful abilities. As of \\"End Game\\" Pt. 2, the Consortium gets away upon Rex doing a planetwide E.V.O. curing making them unaffected by it, but is presumed that they were captured by Providence off-screen. Reddick * Voice Actor: Robin Atkin Downes Reddick is a real estate agent and construction associate who is a member of the Consortium. When merged with a Meta-Nanite, he was transformed into a gray hulking robot E.V.O. with the ability to control gravity and fly. Roswell * Voice Actor: Troy Baker Roswell is a southern businessman who is a member of the Consortium. When merged with the Meta-Nanite, he became a red and blue-armored E.V.O. with powers (but had 1/5 of its powers) that enabled him to control both fire and ice. Sir Anthony Haden-Scott * Voice Actor: Robin Atkin Downes Sir Anthony Haden-Scott is a member of the Consortium. After being injected with the Meta-Nanite, he became an E.V.O. with dark gray armor with orange lightning strikes on it and had the ability to manipulate matter and energy as well as the ability to fly. Vostok * Voice Actor: John DiMaggio Vostok is a black market financier and KGB operative who is a member of the Consortium. He was with the Consortium when Black Knight brought about her plans to restart the Nanite project. Vostok had some doubts about Black Knight's plot causing Black Knight to kill him when they were alone. Black Knight told the other Consortium members that the enemy was responsible for Vostok's death. =Alpha= * Voice Actor: Michael Emerson Alpha was created by Caesar to control other nanites as a sentient being, but its energy/nanite body was unsustainable. Alpha tried to make mechanical bodies to sustain itself and that failed, so instead it tried to use living organic bodies as hosts. Due to this, Alpha was sent to a parallel dimension, the Null Void, by Caesar, who mistakenly thought he had sent the nanite to an empty pocket dimension when in fact it was a prison for alien criminals. Later, Alpha returned as its normal form‚Äîan energy figure shaped as a human. Caesar came to send it back to the Null Void, but was blocked by Ben Tennyson, who thought Caesar was attacking Ben and Rex. Alpha asked for Caesar's help, but Caesar refused. Caesar took Ben and Rex in his mobile lab and explained what Alpha was and how he was trying to return him to the Null Void, but when Alpha attacked the lab Caesar exited alone in an escape pod, leaving Ben and Rex in the exploding remains of the lab to face Alpha. However, they escaped by Ben saving Rex using Cannonbolt. Alpha then attacked the Petting Zoo at The Plant, where he intended to absorb more nanites. He was attacked by Dr. Holiday, Rex, and Ben, where he escaped, not being strong enough to take them all on, but not before learning that Rex's body sheltered an Omega-1 Nanite. Eventually, Alpha was located at the Bug Jar, where Rex, Ben, and White Knight went to go stop him. They quickly discovered that Alpha had absorbed the entire nanite population, growing into a 20-foot tall beast that was set on absorbing Rex's Omega Nanite. Eventually, it even hacked Ben's Ultimatrix due to the nanites it absorbed upon his arrival. It created its own Ultimatrix and transformed into EVO-like versions of several of Ben's forms, specifically Heatblast, Fourarms, and Humongousaur. Rex absorbed all of the nanites Alpha used to make his Ultimatrix, but wasn't strong enough to stop Alpha from taking his Omega-1 nanite. Alpha evolved into a 100-foot tall form with crab- like legs and called itself \\"Alpha-Omega\\". He then proceeded to destroy the city, but was ambushed by Rex and Ben when they merged using Upgrade, greatly enhancing Rex's abilities. Eventually, Rex used Ben as Cannonbolt to attack the protected Omega nanite, and he was morphed into a nanite-cloud form. Rex then absorbed all the nanites Alpha had taken from the inhabitants in the Bug Jar and reduced Alpha to a small nanite sphere made out of dense matter. Caesar then appeared and opened another dimensional rift to the Null Void. Ben transformed into Upchuck and swallowed up the Alpha sphere and left for his universe. Alpha is last seen in the Null Void, breaking out of his sphere. Recurring Characters =Diane Farrah= * Voice Actress: Grey DeLisle Diane Farrah is a newswoman who hosts a news program called \\"Ultimate Exposure\\". She appears regularly at the places where Providence fights EV.O.s, as a hostess of her program or when she's having interviews with people involved with E.V.O.s. Diane arrived at Providence with permission to interview Providence, it is implied by White Knight that she forced him to get access to Providence. Diane appears to have a one-sided crush on Six, as shown when she briefly flirted with him. After fully interviewing Providence, she edited the documentary and made it all about Agent Six, calling him Providence's secret weapon and \\"a man of many mysteries\\". =Breach= * Voice Actress: Hynden Walch Breach is a four-armed human E.V.O. girl. Using her larger arms, Breach can tear open space and time, creating wormholes. Her portals also seem to have a plane, as those who go through them can stand within the portal without having to step out on either of the linked locations. She also has a pocket dimension where she stores the \\"toys\\" or \\"shiny things\\" that appeal to her, including Rex. When they are \\"broken\\", \\"out of place\\" or \\"no good\\", she opens a portal and throws them away in the real world. The pocket dimension is the entire city of Greenville, Ohio, which disappeared when Breach took it. The city is her entire \\"dollhouse\\" in which she plays with her toys and keeps everything neat and tidy. Breach is rather childish, sensitive, and lonely. She yearns for things such as people, E.V.O.s and objects to overcome her loneliness, treating those that attract or amuse her like toys and putting them in her creepy \\"dollhouse\\" pocket dimension. When Breach's powers are enhanced, she can open golden time portals at will. By opening them in time, she possesses the ability to either take or send things from the past or future. The downside to this is that when her powers are enhanced, she is under the control of Van Kleiss' technology, giving him full control over whether or not he wants her to be in control of her abilities. In \\"Lions and Lambs\\", after suffering incredible physical pain while participating in one of Van Kleiss' experiments, Breach was confronted by Rex, during which he asked her why she was willing to tolerate her master's abuse. Although she initially seemed unconvinced, Breach saved Rex from the Pack and they escaped together through one of her portals. During this time she displayed a keen interest in Rex, even taking him to different places that comforted her in the hope that he would learn to understand her. After spending some time alone together and before hugging, she expressed the desire to be with him forever, and at the very least considers him to be a friend. =Circe= * Voice Actress: Tara Sands Circe is a human-looking teenage E.V.O., who is Rex's main romantic interest throughout the entire series. Circe first met Rex in \\"Beyond the Sea,\\" at a beach resort in Cabo Luna by accident during a volleyball game. Although slightly annoyed at the encounter, Rex later convinced her to hang out with him, and she became considerably warmer and friendlier towards him, as she seemed to really enjoy his company and time with him and liked him very much. Later, Circe had to defeat a gigantic Sea Monster E.V.O. as part of an initiation test to become one of The Pack. Although she needed Rex's help to defeat the creature, which she then gladly accepted, Van Kleiss still allowed her to join anyway; both because of her uniquely musical, hypnotic abilities and mostly intending to take advantage of the genuinely pure and strong everlasting romance blossoming between her and Rex to try and lure him over to his side. Circe does indeed have real feelings for Rex and is shown to be much more merciful and lenient towards him than any other members of the Pack as evidence of how much she cares about him. She also is seen with many expressions of guilt, sadness, and regret for working against the one guy she truly cares about with all her heart. She considers Rex her only real friend she has had since becoming an E.V.O. In \\"What Lies Beneath,\\" she admitted to Rex that as much she really cared about him, she could not abandon either the Pack or Van Kleiss as they had taken her in when no one else would. She held his hand in an affectionate way, smiled sadly, and thanked him for saving her life. She had said that being on opposite sides \\"kept things interesting.\\" In \\"Alliance,\\" when Van Kleiss threw an unconscious Rex at the mercy of the vengeful NoFace, she realized Van Kleiss for what he truly is: a ruthless dictator who sees all of his minions as a means to an end. Afterward, she and Rex went their separate ways. She rode off in a Providence motorcycle, minus the tracking device. It was also hinted that Van Kleiss had something on Circe that neither she nor Van Kleiss has revealed, hence why she continued to work for him despite his questionable aggressive methods. She later quit the Pack and traveled to Hong Kong, China, to join Rex's old E.V.O. street gang, where she got along well with Skwydd, which greatly concerned and made Rex really uncomfortable. She also seemed to enjoy having playful hand-to-hand combat training with him. When Rex had said that he was \\"okay\\" with her and Skwydd being an item, she firmly assured him that she and Skwydd were friends on a platonic level and nothing more. Circe has the E.V.O. ability to project destructive hypersonic sound blasts from her mouth. As her name states, Circe also can mystically lure other E.V.O.s towards her with a hypnotic melody. However, use of this ability is limited, as using it for long periods can tire Circe out. Also, using her sound/sonic-based E.V.O. abilities on so many E.V.O.s at once is exhausting. Circe is serious and has a dry wit. For a long time, she had strongly believed that it was ultimately impossible for E.V.O.s and normal humans to get along on the Earth. Thus, she joined The Pack, thinking that being with other E.V.O.s like herself would allow her to find a place to belong. She would do whatever it took to help E.V.O-kind no matter what the cost, even if it meant ignoring her equally true and strong romantic love feelings for Rex, with difficulty. While in Hong Kong, China, with Tuck, Skwydd and Cricket, Circe appeared to be much calmer and having real fun and freedom for once. She was often seen with a smile on her face, and seemed to enjoy sitting next to or having playful hand-to-hand combat training with Skwydd. She was also seen with a much more positive and optimistic attitude, as she was no longer miserable and has found the place where she really belonged. In \\"Assault on Abysus\\", Circe showed up at White Knight's base, informing White Knight's group that Black Knight has captured Tuck, Skwydd, and Cricket. Circe leads Rex to Abysus where the second Meta Nanite is yet to be found. When Abysus is attacked by Black Knight's men, Circe and Biowulf end up buying Rex some time to get away with the Meta Nanite. Before she sacrificed herself for his sake, she had tearfully confessed to Rex that she was never ever just using him in the past, but because she always truly loved him all along and always would. She then romantically kissed Rex and pushed him out of the aircraft, becoming captured and collared by Black Knight's men, allowing him to escape. She smiled down at him, tears welling up in her eyes, and promised that she would be okay. A Black Pawn then placed a white mind- control collar around her neck. In \\"Mind Games,\\" a shape-shifting E.V.O. named Jon Scarecrow was disguised as Circe in order to infiltrate The Plant. When the deception was eventually discovered, he used Circe's appearance to toy with Rex's emotions and break his spirit, aware of his strong feelings for her. At Providence headquarters, it was revealed that the real Circe is collared inside of a prison cell with her mouth gagged by a gray muzzle. The commotion outside had caught her attention and she stepped forward indignantly to see what was going on. In Endgame, Part 2 she and Rex shared a close and loving hug; happy to be together. Putting her arms around him, she jokingly commented on putting himself out of a job. =Rex's Old Gang= This is an E.V.O. street gang that live in Hong Kong, China. It was revealed that Rex was the leader of this gang in his early teenage years before he lost his memory and joined Providence. Rex found them when he and Six were sent to Hong Kong to stop a bank robbery done by them and they recognized Rex. Unfortunately, they got away, and Rex goes after them, he meets Tuck and they soon rejoice of their meet. They tell Rex that he was their leader and many other things which he didn't know. Soon, they tell him the reason behind their thievery, an E.V.O. named Quarry. It is revealed that Rex had sold them to Quarry in order for them to do his bidding. Rex, tries to convince them that it doesn't matter anymore, but they find it hard to believe and leave with Quarry. Rex goes back and battles Quarry to set them free. Eventually, Rex wins the battle and Quarry is taken by Providence. Tuck * Voice Actor: Dante Basco Tuck is a mummy-like E.V.O. His personality is very similar to Rex's. He does not seem bothered by Rex's blackouts, treating them as normal (however this could be because Rex used to keep a journal in case he had a blackout). He also seems to have a sense of humor, trying to scare Rex when he meets up with him and joking that Rex better not forget them (when Rex goes back to Providence). Tuck can also be very cautious. This is shown when he warns Rex about getting on Quarry's bad side. Tuck can also be violent once pushed to the edge. This is shown when he punches Rex in the face after learning that Rex sold him, Skwydd, and Cricket to Quarry although Rex was supposed to be his best friend. As an E.V.O., he is made out of bandage-like filaments that can unravel, disperse, elongate and reshape him at will, but he has never been seen. He seems to have notable acrobatic skills as seen when dodging bullets and having extreme evasive skill while fighting one on one with Six. Skwydd * Voice Actor: Jason Marsden Skwydd is a humanoid squid E.V.O. Skwydd is seen to be pretty much of the serious type, giving Rex serious/obvious answers when Rex jokes around. Skwydd is shown to be rather moody and rarely smiles, something Rex jokes about. Skwydd has an interest in entertaining people as a freak show act. As an E.V.O., he can do many things. He can use his arms' rough skin as a shield and block bullets. He can also use them as a primary source for using blunt force on opponents. He can shoot an ink-like mist made of nanites out of his mouth for cover to escape. This ink can take a 3-D form in the air but is not actually solid. Once, Skwydd's nanite power was boosted with some kind of nanite enhancer and was able to make his ink into a solid state and use it defensively by allowing them to form into tentacles and restrain opponents, but it faded eventually. This suggests he does have the potential to make his ink solid but doesn't know how to do it. He is also shown stretching his arms to attack from a distance, and he can use this ability to cut through solid objects. In the episode \\"Endgame, Part 2\\" after he is cured it is revealed that his real name is Walter. Cricket * Voice Actress: Vyvan Pham Cricket, as her name states, is a Cricket-like E.V.O. Cricket actually seems to be very friendly and outgoing, though tends to be somewhat shy around Rex due to her crush on him. She is very devoted to her friends and will not hold back when fighting to protect one, as displayed in the episode \\"Rabble\\" where she helped Rex who was pinned down by one of Quarry's Enforcers, putting her own life at risk in the process. As an E.V.O., she developed insect-like abilities such as superhuman agility and massive leg strength. Her mutation is most noticeable in her legs, which are bent due to them being structured slightly like a cricket's or grasshopper's. With these legs, she has the ability to jump impressively high and fast and land violently on her opponents, pinning them to the ground. Cricket returns in \\"Remote Control\\", when Quarry takes control of her. Rex mentions that she has a huge romantic crush on him, meaning it is obvious that she really does, as she is often seen flipping her short light magenta-colored hair, and flirting with him in a number of episodes. Other characters =Ben Tennyson= * Voice Actor: Yuri Lowenthal Ben Tennyson is a teenager who wields the Ultimatrix, formerly the Omnitrix. He arrived in Rex's world through a space- time rift. Ben is a legend in his universe due to his use of the powerful Omnitrix/Ultimatrix. He found the Omnitrix when he was ten years of age, a watch filled with alien DNA which had fallen from space. He, his friend, Kevin, and cousin, Gwen, are part of a group called the Plumbers. When Ben first arrived in Rex's universe, they both got into a brawl as Ben mistook Rex for an alien while Rex mistook him for an E.V.O. Ben was eventually captured by the Providence Defect Group, but he escaped, trying to find a way back home. Once he finally realized that there was no way back he gave up and decided to assist Rex in his time of need. At this point, Ben met Caesar, who had come to save them both from Alpha, a dangerous creation made by Caesar six years ago during the Nanite Project. After Alpha turned hostile, Ben used Cannonbolt to escape with Rex from Alpha. The two went back to The Plant where they played basketball and explained their origins. However, Alpha attacked the E.V.O. containment to absorb the nanites from the present E.V.O.s, including Rex. Ben helped save Rex from Alpha, causing him to flee. Humungousaur * Voice Actor: Dee Bradley Baker Humungousaur is a Vaxasaurian, a large brown alien that possesses incredible strength and dinosaur-like features. He can also grow up to a certain extent in size, with an additional increase in strength. Diamondhead * Voice Actor: Dee Bradley Baker Diamondhead is a Petrosapien, an alien that has crystalline features and can grow crystals at will. He is also able to reshape his limbs, such as turning his arm into a sharp blade, as well as firing sharp crystals as projectiles at his opponents. Additionally, he is capable of using his crystals defensively, such as creating crystal walls to protect himself and his allies. Lodestar * Voice Actor: Dee Bradley Baker Lodestar is a Biosovortian, an alien with a floating metal head in between two sharp shoulders that act as a magnetic field. He has crab-like claws and his body is mainly black with yellow feet, hands, shoulders and chest. He possesses the power to control magnetic forces, moving metals and other magnetic objects of all different types. Rath * Voice Actor: John DiMaggio Rath is an Appoplexian, a humanoid alien that is similar to a bipedal tiger. He can retract two short blades from behind his knuckles that allow his punches to be more effective. Rath, like all other Appoplexians, is known for his arrogance and aggressiveness. Big Chill * Voice Actor: Dee Bradley Baker Big Chill is a Necrofriggian, a humanoid, moth-like alien whose wings and antenna can fold up into a hooded robe. He has a black body with blue and white spots, resembling ice chunks, on his limbs. He is capable of exhaling a freezing vapor that can encase his targets in a thick layer of ice. Big Chill can also render himself intangible. He can combine these abilities to freeze objects he passes through. Cannonbolt * Voice Actor: Dee Bradley Baker Cannonbolt is an Arburian Pelarota, a round alien that can curl into a ball. He can accelerate himself in this state, allowing him to burst off very quickly at his opponents. He has a yellow \\"shell\\" which enables him to defend himself. His body is mostly colored white with black stripes. XLR8 * Voice Actor: Yuri Lowenthal XLR8 is a Kineceleran from the planet Kinet, and one of Ben's fastest aliens. He has a black body with a blue striped tail, and a spiked helmet with a blue visor. He has wheels on his feet, and leaves a track of black and blue lines when he runs. Four Arms * Voice Actor: Dee Bradley Baker Four Arms is a Tetramand, a four-armed, red-skinned alien with four eyes. He wears gold gauntlets on his arms and wears long black pants with a gold belt. He wears the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest. Shocksquatch * Voice Actor: David Kaye Shocksquatch is a Gimlinopithecus from the planet Pattersonea. He is an alien with a yeti-like appearance who can manipulate and emit electric currents from his mouth. He was unlocked during the battle with Alpha in the Bug Jar. Upgrade * Voice Actor: Yuri Lowenthal Upgrade is a Galvanic Mechamorph, a humanoid alien that has black skin with green mechanical prints throughout his body. He possesses the ability to manipulate and enhance technology. Upchuck * Voice Actor: Dee Bradley Baker Upchuck is a Gourmand, a reptilian-like being who can digest, and then expel, energy and solid matter. Ben used him to carry the Alpha Nanite's compressed sphere into the Null Void. =Gwen Tennyson= * Voice Actress: Ashley Johnson At some point in Gwen Tennyson's life, she teamed up with Ben, Kevin, and her grandfather, becoming a plumber. Gwen accompanied Ben and Kevin to Japan, where Ben would make a commercial for Mr. Smoothie. When she met Rex, she seemed to be impressed by what Ben had told her about his abilities. Later, Gwen opened a portal to Rex's universe for Rex and Bobo to return home. Gwen is able to control a pink energy called mana, also known as life energy. She can use this energy to shoot attacks, create powerful force fields, and open portals to other dimensions. =Max Tennyson= * Voice Actor: Paul Eiding Max Tennyson is the paternal grandfather of Ben and Gwen. Despite his age, Max has shown on multiple occasions to be a formidable fighter. He was once in the United States Army, an astronaut program, and was a plumber. Before Ben got the Omnitrix, Max tried to keep the Plumbers and the aliens a secret from his family because he wanted to protect them and he did not want this life for his family; however, his plan failed when the Omnitrix and Vilgax came to Earth. =Kevin Levin= * Voice Actor: Greg Cipes Kevin Levin and Gwen accompanied Ben to Japan for advertising in Mr. Smoothie. Later he had a discussion with Rex when Rex thought Gwen was Ben's girlfriend. However, Gwen and Ben are cousins. Gwen is Kevin's girlfriend, and Kevin becomes jealous when Rex briefly flirts with her. Kevin is able to absorb the properties of solid matter due to his Osmosian heritage (a race of aliens that are capable of absorbing energy, DNA and matter). He is able to adapt any solid matter to his body and make it an \\"armor\\" that protects him and enhances his strength. In addition, he is capable of transforming his hands into any weapon with the absorbed material. =Beverly Holiday= * Voice Actress: Jennifer Stone Beverly Holiday is Dr. Holiday's younger sister, she turned into a spider-like E.V.O. when she was thirteen. She is kept in \\"The Hold\\", a containment area meant to hold the most dangerous creatures of the Petting Zoo, and Dr. Holiday has been trying to find a cure ever since. In \\"A Family Holiday\\", she played a major role in the episode, where Dr. Holiday, hearing word of a scientist named Dr. Branden Moses having developed a possible \\"cure\\" for incurable E.V.O.s, takes a leave of absence from Providence and takes Beverly with her, in an attempt to develop a cure with Doctor Moses. It is revealed that Moses is instead planning to supercharge the incurable E.V.O.s mutations (the promise of a cure simply a way to gather incurables) and auction off the army of E.V.O.s to any warlord with cash. Dr. Moses successfully supercharges Beverly's mutation, transforming her into an even more spider-like form. Under threat from Six, Moses explains that the supercharging machine can be used to reverse the mutations instead and explains how to do so. With Six, Rex and Dr. Holiday's help, she is finally cured at the cost of the machine (which was already damaged from the fighting). =Peter Meechum= * Voice Actors: Jeff Bennett (1st Time), Wil Wheaton (2nd Time) Peter Meechum is a man who was turned into a zombie-like E.V.O. in which while his human body was exposed, a blob-shaped head is on top of him with his actual head in the other head's mouth. In this form, he had the ability to turn anyone he touches that have nanites in them into zombie-like creatures that obey his every command. He resisted Rex's curing abilities because Van Kleiss had his daughter Sarah and forced Peter to work for him. After his daughter was rescued, Rex disarmed the bomb and cured Peter. In \\"Mind Games,\\" it was revealed that Peter Meechum was one of the original Nanite Project scientists. Peter had been living in a safe house called Pandora's Box (which is only known to White Knight) ever since he was cured. Black Knight's men managed to locate Pandora's Box and brought him to safety. While the real Meechum was sent to Providence, John Scarecrow assumed his appearance and went with Rex's team. Caesar Salazar gave Peter Meechum a tour of the Petting Zoo. When Peter asked about where White Knight is, Black Knight appeared telling her side of what happened to Black Knight. Peter recognized Black Knight as an associate of the Consortium and told Caesar that he never trusted her. Caesar continued to give Peter a tour of Providence HQ where he tells Peter that he has been recruited to restart the Nanite project. Caesar even brings Peter to where Van Kleiss was being held. In \\"Target: Consortium,\\" Peter was shown to be working on the Nanite Project. Caesar brought in a yellow tube which actually contains the residue of Dr. Gabriel Rylander. =Gabriel Rylander = * Voice Actor: Brent Spiner Dr. Gabriel Rylander is a scientist who worked on the Nanite Project with Rex's parents and other scientists. Rylander, one of the original Nanite Project scientists, wanted to change the Earth with the nanites, ending starvation and disease. After an accident, he took part in Rex's nanite treatment. Apparently, he was a good friend of Rex's family, because he is the one who was naming him. He also cared enough about Rex to try anything to save Rex's life, such as injecting the Omega-1 Nanite into Rex and pushing Van Kleiss into a reactor, despite falling into the reactor himself. After the philanthropists who commissioned the Nanite Project stopped funding, Rylander sent each of them a \\"gift\\" ‚Äì a small device which he had created to shoot a small dosage of active nanites, designed to wear off quickly. It was to show them what they had started, and not finished. In \\"Dark Passage\\", Rylander seemed to know a lot about Rex, including the fact that he had given him his name. Rylander seemed to regret what had happened during the Nanite Event, and in doing so, injected Rex with the Omega-1 Nanite which he called \\"everything\\". He and Van Kleiss seemed to know a lot about Rex's past, although both of them never really revealed it to him - other than Rylander, who revealed the fact that Rex had an older brother. Before he could tell Rex more about his past, Van Kleiss attacked, gravely injuring Rylander. Before Van Kleiss could finish Rex off, Dr. Rylander woke up and pushed himself and Van Kleiss into the reactor, presumably killing them both. In \\"Black and White\\", Dr. Gabriel Rylander's residual energy was found by Providence and placed in a special yellow tube. In \\"Target: Consortium,\\" Caesar is still trying to find a way to restore Gabriel Rylander. Caesar uses a cart to bring the yellow tube containing Gabriel's residue into the lab where Peter Meechum and Van Kleiss are working in. Caesar states that Gabriel didn't die and that his body was split on a molecular level. When Rex finds the Jungle Cat E.V.O. threatening Van Kleiss in the lab, the residue of Gabriel Rylander ends up forming into a ghost-like state where he is glad that he can see Rex again. In \\"Endgame, Part 1\\", Gabriel Rylander is among those who protest against Black Knight's idea to have the Master-Control Nanite torn out of Rex. When Rex is hooked up to the Cylcatron, Gabriel and Peter have a disagreement with Caesar about continuing on with the plan. In \\"Endgame, Part 2\\" Gabriel and Peter tell the Consortium that controlling the vastly limitless cosmic God-like powers of the Meta Nanites would prove to be a problem. After Rex does a mass-E.V.O. curing throughout the planet, Gabriel Rylander and Peter Meechum agree with Caesar to work on a different project. Rylander is a passionate scientist who believes so much the potential success of the Nanite Project. Driven by his guilt, he left his family and life to complete the Nanite Project alone. And he seems to be vengeful. For example, he sent the device to give warnings to the people who refused funding him. =Claire Bowman= * Voice Actress: Danica McKellar Claire Bowman is a girl that Noah likes. Claire is best friends with a clumsy girl name Annie. In \\"Operation: Wingman\\", Claire agrees to go to the prom with Noah only if he can find Annie a date. Noah asks Rex to be his wingman (as he is the only person capable of surviving a date with the clumsy Annie). Despite several setbacks, Claire and Annie enjoy their prom night with Noah and Rex. Claire (along with Annie) returns in the episode \\"Haunted\\" where she and Annie spend a night with Rex and Noah in a haunted house where a ghost cat-like E.V.O. was lurking. Noah and Claire become closer in this episode. When in an elevator in the house, the E.V.O. slams into the doors and crushes them shut, thus locking Noah and Claire inside. Inside, Claire admits to Noah that she is claustrophobic, and so he comforts her and keeps her calm. At the end of the episode, Claire expresses her appreciation for what Noah did for her and afterward they almost kiss but are interrupted when Caesar arrives. =Annie= * Voice Actress: Felicia Day Annie is a girl who is best friends with Claire. Annie is a notorious jinx as she is extremely clumsy and as a result, she can't find a date for the prom in \\"Operation: Wingman\\" (as her clumsiness always ended up injuring her dates). When Claire was asked out by Noah, she told him she would go with him on the condition that he could find Annie a date. Noah picked Rex as he was unaware of Annie's reputation and because Rex was the only person capable of surviving a date with her. Shockingly, Annie's clumsiness proves to be an asset when Rex uses it to blow the rabbit E.V.O. up with a heat-seeking missile. After the prom, the girls agree this is the best date they have ever had, but Rex states that despite Annie being nice and cute, he'll never go on a date with her again. However, in \\"Haunted\\", Noah once again convinces Rex to go on a date with her, so he can go with Claire. =Kenwyn Jones= * Voice Actress: Rutina Wesley Kenwyn Jones is a former Providence cadet. Providence was responsible for saving her family. Kenwyn later joined it because she wanted to repay her debt to them. The experience seemed to have a profound effect on her, causing her to take her training very seriously. Kenwyn is a serious, focused and hardworking Providence agent. She was top of her class which also shows that she has impressive intelligence. After Rex joined her team, he brought her grades down, causing her to descend from being number one. Out of anger, she tried to sabotage Rex, showing she can be vengeful at times. Kenwyn is also shown to be very uptight and controlling. On her first Providence mission with Rex, it was clearly evident that she thought she knew more. She is shown to be very agile and skilled with firearms and Providence weaponry. Being human, she has great hand-to-hand combat and gymnast skills, and has great physical strength and flexibility. Taking the gun for herself, she put good use to it. Kenwyn's intelligence seems to be quite impressive as well. She excelled in the academic goals of Providence Basic Training and was ranked #1 out of all the other students. She even graduated top of the academy as a lieutenant. Rex and Kenwyn are both Providence teammates and are very good friends and their platonic relationship with each other has changed dramatically from where they first started. When Kenwyn first met Rex, she disliked him because of the way he presented himself and how he made her grades drop from being number one in her class. She tried to get revenge on him by turning off the collars, used to prevent the E.V.O's from using their powers in training. Strangely things became mixed up, and she was sent to go training instead. After E.V.O's began to escape from the Cage, Kenwyn saved Rex by acting as a distraction. She later admitted the truth to Rex and apologized. In \\"Lost Weekend,\\" Kenwyn returns to assist Rex and Bobo at an E.V.O. party in the desert. She is now a full-fledged Providence agent and lieutenant. =The Six= The Six are a group of mercenaries that consists of the six most dangerous people on the Earth. Each member's name goes by how dangerous they are. As noted by Six, the ranking focuses on how dangerous they are which in turn is determined by skill level and personality. Six was once a member of this group before joining Providence. The Six first appeared in the episode \\"Divide by Six\\" shown to have ambushed Rex. They attacked Rex to test his skills. Along with Agent Six, the group kidnapped Rex for the purpose of curing One, who has been transformed into an E.V.O. Rex, on the other hand agrees to do it, but the thing is that the group wants to kill him in order to put an end to his misery. When something goes wrong, it turns out he is incurable. All them except Six and Rex then voted to kill him but Six and Rex fought to prevent it from happening. They battled until One possessed Rex and used him to contact Six mysteriously and disappeared by causing the whole mountain top to be filled with a valley of grass. One * Voice Actor: Frank Welker One was the most dangerous man on the planet and the leader. He was one of the first people to go E.V.O. after The Nanite Event, but he was strong-willed enough to suppress the vicious instincts that awoke within him through meditation. To protect his students and innocent people from his new destructive side, One ordered a cell built for himself in center of a volcano on a remote island. The cell contained a safety protocol; if he failed to enter the safety code every 41 minutes, the whole room would collapse into a volcano, killing everyone inside. When Rex tried to cure One for the second time, One possessed Rex's body for a short time to bid farewell to his students. When Six said that he was going to take One home, One replied that he was already home, suggesting that he was with all the people in the world that he cared about. After his death, One bonded with the island and restored its natural balance, becoming one with everything. Out of all of One's students, Six was shown as being the closest to him. Unlike the rest of the Six, Six was willing to sacrifice his mentor's \\"freedom\\" in exchange for the possible cure. One was proud of Six's choice of joining Providence and becoming a hero, even if that meant fewer meetings between them. Dos * Voice Actor: Carlos Alazraqui Dos is an elderly Spanish gentleman, and is the second most dangerous man on the planet. Due to being the second most dangerous man on the planet, his fighting skills are very proficient and he has remarkably quick reflexes. His main weapon is a cane that can be used as a laser pistol, a gas emitter, or sharpened into a blade. Dos and the rest of The Six kidnapped Rex for the purpose of curing One. When Rex failed to cure him, he and the others agreed to kill him because they believed that killing him was better than locking him up in a cage. After Dos was defeated, he helped Rex even though One died eventually. As the second most dangerous man on the planet, Dos is the cruelest of his group and never shows mercy. Though he cares for his mentor, One, he is very willing to kill him, just to \\"put him out of his misery\\". Trey * Voice Actor: Jim Cummings Trey is a large man with a cajun accent, who is physically the strongest of The Six. Trey is not the most intelligent among The Six, he acts like a stereotypical hillbilly-thug. He is shown to be cruel like the rest of the Six and has a habit of cracking bad jokes, which constantly annoys Five. He is slightly less insulting than Dos and IV, but he was not above cracking a cruel joke that Rex's cries sounded like his dogs when Rex was struggling to cure One. He also has a habit of smiling most of the time, which differs from the other members of the Six, who usually keep a neutral look most of the time. Like the other members of the Six, he is very secretive about his life and job. He may work as an enforcer, due to Six's comment about him \\"breaking arms and legs\\". In \\"Six Minus Six\\", Trey, along with Five, encountered Six on the same mission. When they spotted Rex, he and Five reminded Six that no witness was allowed. Trey tried to remember the contract's description, yet eventually failed. At first, they worked together to eliminate Rex, but soon affected by Rex's taunting words they were against each other. He and Five retreated once they were defeated by Six. IV * Voice Actor: Frank Welker IV (=pronounced like ivy) is a mummy-like mercenary, because he has bandages covering his body, that he uses as a weapon, it seems he is able to control them. He can use them to bind opponents and can even use them to his very own aid. He has a rough voice and lost his pinky during a case in Malaysia, which is the only case they lost, and blames Six for that. Out of all the six, he is the most paranoid and would quickly assume the worst. Five * Voice Actress: Olivia d'Abo Five a is a pink-haired Cockney accented English rocker girl as shown by her unique sense of fashion and guitar. Five appears to have a short temper, as she openly expresses her annoyance every time Trey says something completely unrelated to the situation or unintelligent. Similar to her number, she is colder and crueler then Six, but she is shown to be slightly kinder than the ones ranked above her. Unlike Dos and IV, she never once insulted Rex on the mission to save One, and she even threatened Trey for making a cruel joke towards Rex when he was trying to cure One. However, she was still not above attacking Rex and Six, and trying to kill her old master. Like the others members of the Six, she is very secretive about her life and her job. Her main weapon is an electric guitar which she uses as a blunt instrument. With it, she's able to send strong seismic waves by smashing her guitar onto the ground, allowing it to go along a trail to attack her opponent. Five wields the instrument with impeccable skill, which when combined with her speed and fighting abilities makes it a formidable weapon. It also seems to be very durable, as she is able to bludgeon her opponents without causing any damage to the guitar, deflect sword slashes, and absorb the impact of Trey's fists. She later returns in \\"Six Minus Six\\" when both she and Trey appeared with Six when they encountered each other on the same mission. When they spotted Rex, she and Trey reminded Six that no witnesses were allowed. At first they worked together to eliminate Rex, but were soon affected by Rex's words and fought against each other. Five and Trey retreated once they were defeated by Six. =Fitzy Feakins= * Voice Actor: Tom Kenny Fitzy Feakins is a human E.V.O., who is urgently wanted by Providence because of his E.V.O. powers. He is currently hiding out from Providence and is an ally of the Providence Defect Group. According to Feakins, prior to his E.V.O. transformation, he was just an ordinary, rock-loving accountant. After being pulled over and interrogated by Providence, Rex and Noah had run into them. Rex and Noah rescued him and decided to escape with Feakins. They soon found out his powers, the ability to interfere with active nanites around him, and communicated with Dr. Holiday, who informed them that it was obvious that Black Knight wanted him only to make E.V.O. capture much simpler, specifically with Rex himself. After a long and difficult pursuit, they all met up with Holiday at a planned rendezvous. They stationed him in an ice cream truck to hide away from Providence. Rex called it the perfect hiding place due to Feakins' love of milkshakes. Unluckily, Feakins was captured by Providence, saying that he feared being killed by Black Knight. He was forced to neutralize Rex's nanites, allowing him to easily be defeated and taken in by Providence.

In 2013, the New Atlantic Independent Booksellers Association awarded Europa Editions its Paperback Book of the Year award. Notable successes Europa's first publication, 2005's The Days of Abandonment by Elena Ferrante (acquired by Sandra Ozzola and translated by Ann Goldstein), was compared favorably to Anna Karenina in the New York Times and became an Indie Bestseller. Other notable successes at Europa include Muriel Barbery's The Elegance of the Hedgehog (translated by Alison Anderson), which spent over a year on the New York Times and IndieBound bestseller lists;\\"Hedgehog ranks fourth in the paperback fiction bestsellers\\". Jane Gardam's Old Filth, named a notable book of the year by the New York Times; Alina Bronsky's The Hottest Dishes of the Tartar Cuisine (translated by Tim Mohr), a Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal and San Francisco Chronicle favorite read of the year in 2011;, Steve Erickson's Zeroville (a best book of the year pick by the National Book Critics Circle); and Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels, which James Wood in The New Yorker described as, \\"intensely, violently personal.\\" Physical design Europa Editions publications gives all its titles a uniform look, with French flaps, a consistent font on the book spines, and the publisher's stork logo on the front of each volume.

You Deserve Nothing was described by the New York Times as \\"rivetingly plotted and beautifully written.\\" The Christian Science Monitor said Maksik's writing was \\"reminiscent of James Salter's in its sensuality, Francine Prose's capacious inquiry into difficult moral questions and Martin Amis's loose-limbed evocation of the perils of youth.\\" Europa World Noir In 2013, Europa Editions launched its series of international crime fiction, Europa World Noir. Publishers Weekly wrote that the series signaled Europa's ‚Äúreaffirmed enthusiasm for noir.‚Äù Notable titles in the series include Gene Kerrigan's Gold Dagger Award-winning The Rage, Jean-Claude Izzo‚Äôs Total Chaos, which launched the Mediterranean Noir movement, and the reissue of groundbreaking Scottish crime writer William McIlvanney‚Äôs Laidlaw books.

It was released in 1990 by EMI. Overview Quello che non... was released in 1990 by EMI, three years after Guccini's last studio album, Signora Bovary, continuing on the same style. The main themes of the album are memory and nostalgia, along with a sense of disappointment and indecision. The title means \\"What I don't...\\", and an article on La Repubblica said that for Guccini, in chaotic times, it's easier to say what he doesn't want to be than to describe his wishes. The song \\"√Ümilia\\" was written along with Lucio Dalla, and had already been released in the 1988 album Dalla/Morandi by Dalla and Gianni Morandi. Reception The album was generally well received by critics. Allmusic said it had been \\"much praised\\", while the website Ondarock said it was maybe the most musically refined album of Guccini's career. The song \\"Canzone delle domande consuete\\" received the 1990 Targa Tenco for the best song.

It was one of a number of British comedy films which parodied the successful British horror genre, closely associated with the Hammer Horror films.Hutchings p.125 Its plot follows that of a traditional \\"Old Dark House\\" story. Plot Struggling actor Foster Twelvetrees (Frankie Howerd) is invited to a large country home by Stewart Henderson (Ray Milland) to perform a dramatic reading for his family. Outwardly, Stewart is complimentary and enthusiastic, but his more sinister intentions were made clear when earlier he secretly sliced a poster of Twelvetrees. Whilst they chat, Stewart's sister Jessica (Rosalie Crutchley) and their Indian servant Patel (John Bennett) begin searching through Twelvetrees' luggage. Twelvetrees nevertheless responds with an unintentional wit and bumbling characteristic throughout the rest of the film. After they send him to bed, Stewart and Jessica talk cryptically about not being able to find something in his luggage and concluding he must have it elsewhere. Later on Twelvetrees is chided by Stewart for nearly walking in on a restricted room ‚Äì Stewart explains his ill brother Victor is in there. Then during his sleep Twelvetrees is woken to a commotion downstairs: Stewart's other brother Reggie (Hugh Burden) and his daughter Verity (Elizabeth MacLennan) have arrived with Reggie demanding his regular allowance from Victor. Spying on the proceedings Twelvetrees spots Stewart going elsewhere to see his mother. The next day, after being introduced to a snake house underground, Twelvetrees secretly goes upstairs to see Stewart's mother: though kept behind a locked door she initially seems extremely polite and explains her family's history of theatrics in India. Suddenly, she tries to kill Twelvetrees with a knife but he is saved by Patel ‚Äì the servant explains her presence there is secret lest she be taken away. Though very unnerved, Stewart persuades Twelvetrees to stay to perform that evening. Before doing so another brother arrives; Ernest (Kenneth Griffith) and his wife Aggie arrive to demand his regular allowance ‚Äì both he and Reggie have found their cheques from Victor have been bouncing. Suspicious that Stewart is trying to change Victor's will to his favour, Reggie and Ernest resolve to stay and make sure that doesn't happen. In the meantime, Verity persuades Twelvetrees to check up on Victor, and to their shock discover the bed in his room is filled by a dummy. Confronted, Stewart tells Reggie and Ernest that Victor is dead and reveals another secret: Twelvetrees is in fact Victor's secret son and that he is entitled to everything in Victor's will. Plus, Stewart is convinced Twelvetrees unknowingly has a clue to where a batch of diamonds are hidden on the estate. Ernest and Aggie, after their own search, are convinced they've found the clue is a framed misquoted motto and plan to kill Twelvetrees with poison: Stewart foils the plan and works out they know whatever the clue must be. Later that evening during a Henderson family performance Ernest is killed with a stab to the back. Petrified, Twelvetrees makes a hasty exit only to be pursued by Verity: she convinces him to come back after she reveals the true identity of his father and his place in his will: he is in line to take over his money, the house and its estates. Whilst confronting his uncles, Foster is told by Verity about the diamonds, their secret location and the fact he might be in possession of a clue to their location. Whilst he goes for the police Foster gets lost in the forest and eventually finds Patel: he tells him to go in his place. However, having taken some of his clothes, Patel is mistaken by the Henderson mother and she kills him as he walks through the woods. Going back to the house, Foster meets up with Verity again to find Jessica ‚Äì in possession of his framed motto ‚Äì and Agnes dead by the snakehouse. Foster explains he received the motto in the post and Verity notices it's inaccurate. Explaining that it came with a birth certificate, Verity concludes the clue must be in his name. Foster goes to get it ‚Äì learning his real name is Nigel Anthony Julian Amadeus Henderson ‚Äì but comes back to Verity on the floor. Reggie walks in immediately and says she's dead. Foster, left alone, works out the clue: his initials form naja ‚Äì a genus of snake, and he finds a package in the snake house. Confronted then by Stewart ‚Äì Reggie having been killed in the interim ‚Äì Foster refuses to hand it over and a violent chase ensues, but Foster traps Stewart with his mother. Downstairs, Foster is confronted by an alive Verity pointing a gun at him. She demands the diamonds and he unwraps the package, throwing the covering paper into the fire. However, the document inside reveals the covering paper was actually the map to the diamonds hidden in the estate, by the time they realize the map is already burned away. The film ends with Stewart, Verity and the Henderson mother being taken away in a police cart, whilst a camera shot moves away from Foster beginning to dig in the large grounds outside the house to find the diamonds.

He created a stamhus (family trust) from his estates and was raised to the peerage under the name Brinck-Seidelin in 1753. His son, who was also named Hans Diderik de Brinck-Seidelin and inherited Eriksholm in 1778, commissioned the architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff to design a new main building which was completed in 1788. Eriksholm Brinck-Seidelin was hit by the financially difficult times for the large landowners and Eriksholm was in 1824 sold in public auction to Prime Minister Frederik Julius Falkenskiold Kaas (1758-1827). =Later history= In 1878, Frederik Ahlefeldt-Laurvig (1817‚Äì1889) bought Eriksholm and immediately passed it on to his son, later Minister of Foreign Affairs William Ahlefeldt-Laurvig. The estate has been in the possession of the Ahlefeldt-Laurvig family ever since. Architecture Designed in the Neoclassical style, Eriksholm is built in white-washed brick and consists of three wings under a black-glazed tile roof. The semicircular buildings which connect the main wings to the lower and short lateral wings are typical of the contemporary English Palladianism. The window frames and portals are made of sandstone from Bornholm. Eriksholm today The estate covers 335 hectares of farmland and 331 hectares of forest (1995). The main building is rented out for weddings, meetings and other events.

He is well known for his prolific publishing in the field of gastroenterology particularly in colonoscopy and colorectal cancer screening History of endoscopy in the colon and rectum, chapter by Hirohumi Niwa and Christopher Williams in Colonoscopy: Principles and practice, Waye, Rex and Williams. and is widely regarded as one of the doctors who established colonoscopy as a safe and effective procedure. He played a key role in Medicare reimbursement for colonoscopy resulting in adoption of the procedure as a colorectal cancer screening tool in the US. Rex returned to home state Indiana and enrolled at Indiana University School of Medicine in 1976 after graduating from Harvard College, Boston. As noted on the IU webpages, he remains loyal to his alma mater despite being in considerable demand all over the world. He has won many accolades including the Master Endoscopist Award (2003) and Rudolf Schindler award (2013) from ASGE; Berk- Fise clinical achievement award (2011) from ACG. He is a past president and a Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, a Master of the American College of Physicians, and is a Distinguished Professor of medicine at Indiana University since 2009. Early life Rex was born in Ligonier, Indiana and attended West Noble High School before going on to Harvard College on a General Motors scholarship. Medical career Rex graduated summa cum laude from Harvard and enrolled at Indiana University School of Medicine in 1976. After graduating with the highest distinction from medical school he pursued residency at the same school going on for a fellowship in gastroenterology and chief residency at one of the IU hospitals. Colonoscopy in the 1980s was still considered unsafe and screening programs were mostly limited to occult blood testing, which although extremely cheap, was not very accurate. Rex conducted the first population based study where he invited about 800 doctors and spouses in Indiana for screening colonoscopy. In addition to confirming the safety of the procedure, high polyp prevalence was noted which was replicated in later studies. More than two-thirds of colorectal cancer burden is the result of slowly progressing pre-cancerous polyps. Removal of at least larger of these polyps should therefore result in a decrease of colorectal cancer incidence. Colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer was thus established in the United States. Rex is a major figure in the technical aspect of colonoscopy and his textbook on the procedure penned with Waye and Williams, remains the authority in that particular field.Porro, G.B. (2005) Book Review [Review of the book Colonoscopy‚ÄîPrinciples and Practice by J.D. Waye, D.K. Rex, C.B. Williams] Digestive and Liver Disease, Volume 37, Issue 7, Page 545. His most widely cited study is a tandem colonoscopy study in which 183 patients underwent 2 colonoscopies on the same day. The study brought to light that colonoscopy misses a significant percentage of pre-cancerous polyps. Since then Rex has been an international leader in the movement to improve the quality of colonoscopy performance.Rex, D. K. (2006). Maximizing detection of adenomas and cancers during colonoscopy.

Its duration is 32 minutes.

Accessed: November 12, 2011. History Cosmic Pulses is the Thirteenth Hour of the unfinished Klang (Sound) cycle. Massimo Simonini, artistic director of Angelica, commissioned the piece in partnership with the Dissonanze festival of electronic music. Stockhausen began realising the piece in December 2006.COSMIC PULSES, 13th Hour of KLANG (SOUND) (archive from 4 April 2014; accessed 20 July 2015). The world premiere occurred on 7 May 2007 at Auditorium Parco della Musica (Sala Sinopoli) in Rome.Stockhausen, Karlheinz. Stockhausen-Courses Kuerten 2007: Composition Course on KLANG/SOUND, the 24 Hours of the Day: Second Hour: FREUDE for Two Harps, 2005, Work No. 82. K√ºrten: Stockhausen-Verlag, 2007. In the Klang cycle, Cosmic Pulses represents a turning point. It is the beginning of the second half of the cycle, and all of the music after the thirteenth hour is electroacoustic, employing partial mixdowns of Cosmic Pulses as the tape accompaniment. A recording of the piece was released on CD 91 by the Stockhausen-Verlag. The CD also presents the beginning moments of all 24 isolated layers on separate tracks. Materials and concepts The number 24 is central to the construction of Cosmic Pulses. There are 24 layers of sound. There are 24 \\"melodic loops\\", spaced throughout 24 different registers (spanning 7 octaves). There are 24 different tempi.Program from the world premiere performance. (pdf) Stockhausen defines the tempi in the piece as units of 8 tones and pulsesStockhausen, Karlheinz. Jerusem. K√ºrten: Stockhausen-Verlag, 2007. p. III The fastest tempo is 240 beats per minute (bpm). Eight pulses per 240 bpm equals 1,920 tones and pulses per minute. The low end of the tempo scale is 1.17 bpm, which yields 9.36 tones and pulses per minute. The source timbre for the piece is a synthesizer.Walls, Seth Colter. Das Reboot at Issue Project Room, December 12, 2011. Antonio P√©rez Abell√°n was responsible for constructing and synchronizing the layers.Stockhausen, Karlheinz. Cosmic Pulses, CD Liner Notes. K√ºrten: Stockhausen-Verlag, 2007. The loops are layered on top of each other, beginning in the low register and moving to the high register. They are staggered in a way that the low loops drop out as the high loops take over, creating a rough progression from low sounds to high over the course of the piece.Collins, p. 89. Stockhausen used a basic graphic notation to indicate how each loop should be altered from its fundamental form through pitch and tempo changes. Stockhausen called these changes glissandi, requiring them to be smoothly executed with faders for a continuous deviation from the original loop. Kathinka Pasveer realized these ornamentations using his score. The tempo could change by as much as a factor of 12, and the pitch variations could be as narrow as a tritone or as wide as a major tenth. Cosmic Pulses is designed for an 8-channel sound system that surrounds the audience in a square, with 2 channels on each side and a subwoofer on every channel.Stockhausen, Karlheinz. Orvonton. K√ºrten: Stockhausen-Verlage. 2007, p. III-IV. Stockhausen chose 241 trajectories for sound to travel through such a system. Therefore, each loop has a specific path to travel through the system. > For the first time, I have tried out superimposing 24 layers of sound, as if > I had to compose the orbits of 24 moons or 24 planets (for example, the > planet Saturn has 48 moons) ‚Ä¶ If it is possible to hear everything, I do not > yet know‚Äîit depends on how often one can experience an 8-channel > performance. In any case, the experiment is extremely fascinating! During his lectures surrounding the German premiere, Stockhausen said that he had \\"not made up his mind concerning it\\" yet, and he admitted that the piece might be regarded as \\"not music, just sound\\" and it might be better to \\"just take it as a natural phenomena and not think of composition\\".Collins, p. 90. The OKTEG Joachim Haas and Gregorio Karman from the Experimental Studio for Acoustic Art of S√ºdwestrundfunk (SWR, \\"Southwest Broadcasting\\") in Freiburg, which had been founded on 1 September 1971 as the Experimentalstudio der Heinrich-Strobel-Stiftung des SWF,Anon. \\"Jubil√§um: 40 Jahre Experimentalstudio des SWR\\" (Stuttgart, Baden-Baden, Mainz: SWR.de, 2011) (Accessed 14 December 2011) created the OKTEG, a special piece of equipment to allow Stockhausen to realize the spatialization manually. They brought the OKTEG to K√ºrten in March 2007 to spatialize the piece. Other firms had done similar things for Stockhausen. For example, the WDR studio technicians built a manually driven \\"rotation table\\" for the production of Kontakte in 1958‚Äì59, and an improved, electrically driven model (capable of up to 25 rotations per second) for Sirius in the early 1970s.Karlheinz Stockhausen, Kompositions-Kurs √ºber SIRIUS, Elektronische Musik und Trompete, Sopran, Ba√üklarinette, Ba√ü (1975‚Äì77) (K√ºrten: Stockhausen-Verlag, 2000): 43‚Äì44. The Modul 69 B for Mantra, was built to the composer's specification by the Lawo company from Rastatt, near Baden-Baden,Karlheinz Stockhausen, Mantra f√ºr 2 Pianisten (1970), Werk Nr. 32 (score) (K√ºrten: Stockhausen-Verlag, 1975): i, iv, and vii) a switcher-controller, a regulator-distributor, and two \\"rotation mills\\" for the spherical pavilion at Osaka's World Fair, were built to Stockhausen's designs by Mr Leonard of the Firma Electronic in Z√ºrich in October 1968.Karlheinz Stockhausen, \\"Osaka-Projekt: Kugelauditorium EXPO 70\\", in his Texte zur Musik 3, edited by Dieter Schnebel, 153‚Äì87, DuMont Dokumente (Cologne: Verlag M. DuMont Schauberg). Citation on p. 167. The OKTEG (Octophonic Effect Generator) relies on a Max/MSP patch that uses eight variable-law amplitude panning modules. The modules are driven by individual sequencers with tempo control. An execution queue containing the rotation data specified by Stockhausen's maps managed the messages that controlled all eight sequencers. Motor faders allowed real-time adjustment of the tempo of each sequencer. The performance of these real-time adjustments was encoded as a frequency-modulated audio-rate sawtooth. This signal was then recorded as an audio track in ProTools. This audio track is then used as a controller to realize the finished audio files. Reception After the world premiere performance, Stockhausen signed autographs for an hour and a half.Collins, p. 89. The German premiere at the Stockhausen Courses was met with a partial standing ovation as well as some boos. Reviewing the course concerts in MIT's Computer Music Journal, Nick Collins called the source timbre \\"a rather cheap electric piano sound\\", and reported that those in the audience \\"who had heard more recent electroacoustic music were slightly perturbed by the bad timbre at the start for the source sound\\". However, Collins observed that this was \\"quickly subsumed into the granular storm as the layers gather and tempi increase\\", concluding that, notwithstanding audience consensus that \\"the overload last[ed] too long in the middle ‚Ä¶ It might cautiously be claimed that Mr. Stockhausen achieved a controversial success, and created a work that has reinvigorated his electronic music\\". Collins shared his shorthand notes, which he scribbled in the dark during the performance: > violent spasms of space, serial recurrences, a Copernican asylum, over- > literal crashes, rushing more and more beyond sense, like being inside > Stockhausen‚Äôs mind as he composes, a battle of enraged keyboardists in a > tempo war, granular roars, bass pedals and clatters, gurgling granules > accelerate, pushing the boundary of information, tapes spooling mercilessly, > a labyrinth of tone pulses, a multiplicity of collisions in an organ > factory, even poor synthesis can‚Äôt ruin this controlled chaos, wider and > wider dynamics and layering, building to the synchronies of planets, raging > layers, raging presets in a keyboard shop war, a fight at an audio > convention.

George Hall concluded that \\"the most riveting of the concert's offerings turned out to be the purely electronic Cosmic Pulses, a 30-minute continuum of mighty and minute sounds ricocheting round the hall like some infinite, inter-galactic bunfight.

The Scandinavian Mountains are often erroneously thought to be equivalent to the Scandinavian Caledonides, an ancient mountain range and orogen covering roughly the same area. The western sides of the mountains drop precipitously into the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, forming the fjords of Norway, whereas to the northeast they gradually curve towards Finland. To the north they form the border between Norway and Sweden, reaching high at the Arctic Circle. The mountain range just touches northwesternmost Finland but are scarcely more than hills at their northernmost extension at the North Cape (Nordkapp). The mountains are not very high but are very steep in places; Galdh√∏piggen in South Norway is the highest peak in mainland Northern Europe, at ; Kebnekaise is the highest peak on the Swedish side, at , whereas the slope of Halti is the highest point in Finland, at , although the peak of Halti is situated in Norway. The combination of a northerly location and moisture from the North Atlantic Ocean has caused the formation of many ice fields and glaciers. Temperature drops with increasing altitude; in South Norway, permafrost becomes common from about 1,500 meters above sea level on the western slope, and at about 1,200 meters above sea level on the eastern slope near the border with Sweden. In Northern Norway, permafrost becomes common from around 800 to 900 meters above sea level on the western slope, and some 600 meters above sea level on the eastern slope.http://www.cicero.uio.no/fulltext/index.aspx?id=9539 The Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands terrestrial ecoregion is closely associated with the mountain range. Names in Scandinavia Its names in the Scandinavian languages are, in Swedish Skandinaviska fj√§llkedjan, Skanderna (encyclopedic and professional usage), Fj√§llen (\\"The Fells\\", common in colloquial speech) or K√∂len (\\"The Keel\\"), and in Norwegian Den skandinaviske fjellkjede, Skandesfjellene, Kj√∏len (\\"The Keel\\") or Nordryggen (\\"The North Ridge\\", name coined in 2013). The names K√∂len and Kj√∏len are often preferentially used for the northern part, where the mountains form a narrow range near the border region of Norway and Sweden. In South Norway there is a broad scatter of mountain regions with individual names, such as Dovrefjell, Hardangervidda, Jotunheimen, and Rondane. Orography The mountain chain's highest summits are mostly concentrated in an area (of mean altitude of over 1,000 m) between Stavanger and Trondheim in South Norway, with numerous peaks over 1,300 m and some peaks over 2,000 m. Around Trondheim Fjord, peaks decrease in altitude to about 400‚Äì500 m rising again to heights in excess of 1,900 m further north in Swedish Lapland and nearby areas of Norway. The southern part of the mountain range contains the highest mountain of Northern Europe, Galdh√∏piggen at almost 2,500 m. This part of the mountain chain is also broader and contains a series of plateaux and gently undulating surfaces that hosts scattered inselbergs. The plateaux and undulating surfaces of the southern Scandinavian Mountains form a series of stepped surfaces. Geomorphologist Karna Lidmar-Bergstr√∂m and co-workers recognize five widespread stepped surfaces. In eastern Norway, some of the stepped surfaces merge into a single surface. Dovre and Jotunheimen are rises from the highest of the stepped surfaces. In south-western Norway, the plateaux and gently undulating surfaces are strongly dissected by fjords and valleys. The mountain chain is present in Sweden from northern Dalarna northwards; south of this point the Scandinavian Mountains lie completely within Norway. Most of the Scandinavian Mountains lack \\"alpine topography\\", and where present it does not relate to altitude. An example of this is the distribution of cirques in southern Norway that can be found both near sea level and at 2,000 m. Most cirques are found between 1,000 and 1,500 m. To the east, the Scandinavian Mountains proper bounds with mountains that are lower and less dissected and are known in Swedish as the f√∂rfj√§ll (literally \\"fore-fell\\"). Generally the f√∂rfj√§ll do not surpass 1,000 m above sea level. As a geomorphic unit the f√∂rfj√§ll extends across Sweden as a 650 km long and 40 to 80 km broad belt from Dalarna in the south to Norrbotten in the north. While lower than the Scandinavian Mountains proper, the f√∂rfj√§ll's pronounced relief, its large number of plateaux ,and its coherent valley system distinguish it from so- called undulating hilly terrain (Swedish: bergkullsterr√§ng) and plains with residual hills (Swedish: bergkullsl√§tt) found further east.

The Svecofennian and Sveconorwegian provinces are shown in yellow and salmon respectively. Reconstruction showing the collision of three paleocontinents during Caledonian orogeny approximately 390 million years ago. The red line shows where the Iapetus Suture extends in the present day. Note that Scandinavian Caledonides were just one branch of the Caledonian orogeny that affected much of what is now Europe. Most of the rocks of the Scandinavian Mountains are Caledonian, which means they were put in place by the Caledonian orogeny. Caledonian rocks overlie rocks of the much older Svecokarelian and Sveconorwegian provinces. The Caledonian rocks actually form large nappes () that have been thrust over the older rocks. Much of the Caledonian rocks have been eroded since they were put in place, meaning that they were once thicker and more contiguous. It is also implied from the erosion that the nappes of Caledonian rock once reached further east than they do today. The erosion has left remaining massifs of Caledonian rocks and windows of Precambrian rock. While there are some disagreements, geologists generally recognize four units among the nappes: an uppermost, an upper, a middle and a lower unit. The lower unit is made up Ediacaran (Vendian), Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian-aged sedimentary rocks. Pieces of Precambrian shield rocks are in some places also incorporated into the lower nappes. It was during the Silurian and Devonian periods that the Caledonian nappes were stacked upon the older rocks and upon themselves. This occurred in connection to the closure of the Iapetus Ocean as the ancient continents of Laurentia and Baltica collided. This collision produced a Himalayas-sized mountain range named the Caledonian Mountains roughly over the same area as the present-day Scandinavian Mountains. The Caledonian Mountains began a post- orogenic collapse in the Devonian, implying tectonic extension and subsidence. Despite occurring in about the same area, the ancient Caledonian Mountains and the modern Scandinavian Mountains are unrelated. =Origin= The origin of today's mountain topography is debated by geologists. Geologically, the Scandinavian Mountains are an elevated, passive continental margin similar to the mountains and plateaux found on the opposite side of the North Atlantic in Eastern Greenland or in Australia's Great Dividing Range. The Scandinavian Mountains attained its height by tectonic processes different from orogeny, chiefly in the Cenozoic. A two-stage model of uplift has been proposed for the Scandinavian Mountains in South Norway. A first stage in the Mesozoic and a second stage starting from the Oligocene. The uplift of South Norway has elevated the westernmost extension of the sub-Cambrian peneplain which forms part of what is known as the Paleic surface in Norway. In South Norway, the Scandinavian Mountains had their main uplift phase later (Neogene) than in northern Scandinavia which had its main phase of uplift in the Paleogene. For example, the Hardangervidda uplifted from sea level to its present 1200‚Äì1100 m in Early Pliocene times. The various episodes of uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains were similar in orientation and tilted land surfaces to the east while allowing rivers to incise the landscape. Some of the tilted surfaces constitute the Muddus plains landscape of northern Sweden. The progressive tilt contributed to create the parallel drainage pattern of northern Sweden. Uplift is thought to have been accommodated by coast-parallel normal faults and not by fault-less doming. Therefore, the common labelling of the southern Scandivavian Mountains and the northern Scandinavian Mountains as two domes is misleading. There are divided opinions on the relation between the coastal plains of Norway, the strandflat, and the uplift of the mountains. Unlike orogenic mountains, there is no widely accepted geophysical model to explain elevated passive continental margins such as the Scandinavian Mountains. Various mechanisms of uplift have, however, been proposed over the years. A 2012 study argues that the Scandinavian Mountains and other elevated passive continental margins most likely share the same mechanism of uplift and that this mechanism is related to far-field stresses in Earth's lithosphere. The Scandinavian Mountains can according to this view be likened to a giant anticlinal lithospheric fold. Folding could have been caused by horizontal compression acting on a thin to thick crust transition zone (as are all passive margins).L√∏seth and Hendriksen 2005 Alternative lines of research have stressed the role of climate in inducing erosion that induces an isostatic compensation; fluvial and glacial erosion and incision during the Quaternary is thought to have contributed to the uplift of the mountain by forcing an isostatic response. The total amount of uplift produced by this mechanism could be as much as 500 m. Other geoscientists have implied diapirism in the asthenosphere as being the cause of uplift. One hypothesis states that the early uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains could be indebted to changes in the density of the lithosphere and asthenosphere caused by the Iceland plume when Greenland and Scandinavia rifted apart about 53 million years ago. =Quaternary geology= Many slopes and valleys are straight because they follow tectonic fractures that are more prone to erosion. Another result of tectonics in the relief is that slopes corresponding to footwalls of normal faults tend to be straight. There is evidence that the drainage divide between the Norwegian Sea and the south-east flowing rivers were once further west. Glacial erosion is thought to have contributed to the shift of the divide, which in some cases ought to have been in excess of 50 km. Much of the Scandinavian Mountains has been sculpted by glacal erosion. The mountain chain is dotted with glacial cirques usually separated from each other by pre- glacial paleosurfaces. Glacier erosion has been limited in these paleosurfaces which form usually plateaus between valleys. As such the paleosurfaces were subject of diverging and slow ice flow during the glaciations. In contrast valleys concentrated ice flow forming fast glaciers or ice streams. At some locations coalesced cirques form ar√™tes and pyramidal peaks. Glacial reshaping of valleys is more marked in the western part of the mountain chain where drowned glacier-shaped valleys constitute the fjords of Norway. In the eastern part of the mountain chain, glacial reshaping of valleys is weaker. Many mountain tops contain blockfields which escaped glacial erosion either by having been nunataks in the glacial periods or by being protected from erosion under cold-based glacier ice. Karst systems, with their characteristic caves and sinkholes, occur at various places in the Scandinavian Mountains, but are more common in the northern parts. Present-day karst systems might have long histories dating back to the Pleistocene or even earlier. Much of the mountain range is mantled by deposits of glacial origin including till blankets, moraines, drumlins and glaciofluvial material in the form of outwash plains and eskers. Bare rock surfaces are more common in the western side of the mountain range. Although the ages of these deposits and landforms vary, most of them were formed in connection to the Weichselian glaciation and the subsequent deglaciation. Reconstruction of Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum of the Weichselian and W√ºrm glaciations periods. note that the whole of the Scandinavian Mountains are covered with glacier ice (white). The Cenozoic glaciations that affected Fennoscandia most likely began in the Scandinavian Mountains. It is estimated that during 50% of the last 2.75 million years the Scandinavian Mountains hosted mountain-centered ice caps and ice fields. The ice fields from which the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet grew out multiple times most likely resembled today's ice fields in Andean Patagonia. During the last glacial maximum (ca. 20 ka BP) all the Scandinavian Mountains were covered by the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, which extended well beyond the mountains into Denmark, Germany, Poland and the former USSR. As the ice margin started to recede 22‚Äì17 ka BP the ice sheet became increasingly concentrated in the Scandinavian Mountains. Recession of the ice margin led the ice sheet to be concentrated in two parts of the Scandinavian Mountains, one part in South Norway and another in northern Sweden and Norway. These two centres were for a time linked, so that the linkage constituted a major drainage barrier that formed various large ephemeral ice-dammed lakes. About 10 ka BP, the linkage had disappeared and so did the southern centre of the ice sheet a thousand years later. The northern centre remained a few hundred years more, and by 9,7 ka BP the eastern Sarek Mountains hosted the last remnant of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet. As the ice sheet retreated to the Scandinavian Mountains it was dissimilar to the early mountain glaciation that gave origin to the ice sheet as the ice divide lagged behind as the ice mass concentrated in the west.

More than 20,000 of the total were Jewish.\\"History and Overview of Ravensbruck,\\" Jewish Virtual Library, , accessed 31 Jan 2020 More than 80 percent were political prisoners. Many slave labor prisoners were employed by Siemens & Halske. From 1942 to 1945, medical experiments to test the effectiveness of sulfonamides were undertaken. In the spring of 1941, the SS established a small adjacent camp for male inmates, who built and managed the camp's gas chambers in 1944. Of some 130,000 female prisoners who passed through the Ravensbr√ºck camp, about 50,000 of them perished, some 2,200 were killed in the gas chambers. Prisoners Construction of the camp began in November 1938 by the order of the SS leader Heinrich Himmler and was unusual in that it was intended exclusively to hold female inmates. Ravensbr√ºck first housed prisoners in May 1939, when the SS moved 900 women from the Lichtenburg concentration camp in Saxony. Eight months after the start of World War II the camp's maximum capacity was already exceeded. It underwent major expansion following the invasion of Poland. By the summer of 1941 with the launch of Operation Barbarossa an estimated total of 5,000 women were imprisoned, who were fed gradually decreasing hunger rations.Saidel 2006, p. 15. By the end of 1942, the inmate population of Ravensbr√ºck had grown to about 10,000. The greatest number of prisoners at one time in Ravensbr√ºck was probably about 45,000. Between 1939 and 1945, some 130,000 to 132,000 female prisoners passed through the Ravensbr√ºck camp system. According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, about 50,000 of them perished from disease, starvation, overwork and despair; some 2,200 were killed in the gas chambers.Michael Berenbaum (2015), Ravensbr√ºck, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved 26 January 2015. on 29‚Äì30 April 1945 some 3,500 prisoners were still alive in the main camp. During the first year of their stay in the camp, from August 1940 to August 1941, roughly 47 women died. During the last year of the camp's existence, about 80 inmates died each day from disease or famine-related causes. Although the inmates came from every country in German-occupied Europe, the largest single national group in the camp were Polish. In the spring of 1941, the SS authorities established a small men's camp adjacent to the main camp. The male inmates built and managed the gas chambers for the camp in 1944. There were children in the camp as well. At first, they arrived with mothers who were Romani or Jews incarcerated in the camp or were born to imprisoned women.https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/04/remembering-the-lesbians- prostitutes-and-resisters-of-ravensbruck-concentration-camp.html There were few children early on, including a few Czech children from Lidice in July 1942. Later the children in the camp represented almost all nations of Europe occupied by Germany. Between April and October 1944 their number increased considerably, consisting of two groups. One group was composed of Romani children with their mothers or sisters brought into the camp after the Romani camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau was closed. The other group included mostly children who were brought with Polish mothers sent to Ravensbr√ºck after the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Most of these children died of starvation. Ravensbr√ºck had 70 sub-camps used for slave labour that were spread across an area from the Baltic Sea to Bavaria. Ravensbr√ºck crematorium Among the thousands executed at Ravensbr√ºck were four members of the British World War II organization Special Operations Executive (SOE): Denise Bloch, Cecily Lefort, Lilian Rolfe and Violette Szabo. Other victims included the Roman Catholic nun √âlise Rivet, Elisabeth de Rothschild (the only member of the Rothschild family to die in the Holocaust), Russian Orthodox nun St. Maria Skobtsova, the 25-year-old French Princess Anne de Bauffremont-Courtenay, Milena Jesensk√°, lover of Franz Kafka, and Olga Ben√°rio, wife of the Brazilian Communist leader Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes. The largest single group of women executed at the camp were 200 young Polish members of the Home Army. Among the survivors of Ravensbr√ºck was author Corrie ten Boom, arrested with her family for harbouring Jews in their home in Haarlem, the Netherlands. She documented her ordeal alongside her sister Betsie ten Boom in her book The Hiding Place, which was eventually produced as a motion picture. Polish Countess Karolina Lanckoronska, an art historian and author of Michelangelo in Ravensbr√ºck, was imprisoned there from 1943 until 1945. SOE agents who survived were Yvonne Baseden and Eileen Nearne, who was a prisoner in 1944 before being transferred to another work camp and escaping. Englishwoman Mary Lindell and American Virginia d'Albert-Lake, both leaders of escape and evasion lines in France, survived. Ravensbr√ºck survivors who wrote memoirs about their experiences include Gemma La Guardia Gluck, sister of New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, as well as Germaine Tillion, a Ravensbr√ºck survivor from France who published her own eyewitness account of the camp in 1975.Germaine Tillion, Ravensbr√ºck: An eyewitness account of a women's concentration camp.

Approximately 500 women from Ravensbr√ºck were transferred to Dachau, where they were assigned as labourers to the Agfa-Commando; the women assembled ignition timing devices for bombs, artillery ammunition, and V-1 and V-2 rockets.

Besides the male Nazi administrators, the camp staff included over 150 female SS guards assigned to oversee the prisoners at some point during the camp's operational period. Ravensbr√ºck also served as a training camp for over 4,000 female overseers. The technical term for a female guard in a Nazi camp was an Aufseherin.https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre- resistance/en/document/violence-female-guards-nazi-concentration- camps-1939-1945-reflections-dynamics-and-logics-p The women either stayed in the camp or eventually served in other camps. Some of these women went on to serve as chief wardresses in other camps. Several dozen block overseers (Blockf√ºhrerinnen), accompanied by dogs, SS men and whips oversaw the prisoners in their living quarters in Ravensbr√ºck, at roll call and during food distribution. At any single time, a report overseer (Rapportf√ºhrerin) handled the roll calls and general discipline of the internees. Rosel Laurenzen originally served as head of the labour pool at the camp (Arbeitdienstf√ºhrerin) along with her assistant Gertrud Schoeber. In 1944 Greta B√∂sel took over this command. Other high ranking SS women included Christel Jankowsky, Ilse Goeritz, Margot Dreschel and Elisabeth Kammer. Head wardress at the Uckermark death complex of Ravensbr√ºck was Ruth Neudeck (January 1945 ‚Äì March 1945). Regular Aufseherinnen were not usually granted access to the internees' compound unless they supervised inside work details. Most of the 'SS' women met their prisoner work gangs at the gate each morning and returned them later in the day. The treatment by the SS women in Ravensbr√ºck was normally brutal. Elfriede Muller, an SS Aufseherin in the camp was so harsh that the prisoners nicknamed her \\"The Beast of Ravensbr√ºck\\". Other guards in the camp included Hermine Boettcher-Brueckner, Luise Danz, Irma Grese, and Margarethe de Hueber.

It was discovered that she had been a guard at Ravensbr√ºck from 1944 to 1945. Life in the camp Road roller When a new prisoner arrived at Ravensbr√ºck she was required to wear a colour-coded triangle (a winkel) that identified her by category, with a letter sewn within the triangle indicating the prisoner's nationality. For example, Polish women wore red triangles, denoting a political prisoner, with a letter \\"P\\" (by 1942, Polish women became the largest national component at the camp). Soviet prisoners of war, and German and Austrian Communists wore red triangles; common criminals wore green triangles; and Jehovah's Witnesses were labelled with lavender triangles. Prostitutes, Romani, homosexuals, and women who refused to marry were lumped together, with black triangles. Jewish women wore yellow triangles but sometimes, unlike the other prisoners, they wore a second triangle for the other categories. For example, quite often it was for rassenschande (\\"racial pollution\\"). Some detainees had their hair shaved, such as those from Czechoslovakia and Poland, but other transports did not. In 1943, for instance, a group of Norwegian women came to the camp (Norwegians/Scandinavians were ranked by the Nazis as the purest of all Aryans). None of them had their hair shaved. Between 1942 and 1943, almost all Jewish women from the Ravensbr√ºck camp were sent to Auschwitz in several transports, following Nazi policy to make Germany Judenrein (cleansed of Jews). Based on the Nazis' incomplete transport list Zugangsliste, documenting 25,028 names of women sent by Nazis to the camp, it is estimated that the Ravensbr√ºck prisoner population's ethnic structure comprised: Poles 24.9%, Germans 19.9%, Jews 15.1%, Soviets 15.0%, French 7.3%, Romani 5.4%, other 12.4%. The Gestapo further categorised the inmates as: political 83.54%, anti- social 12.35%, criminal 2.02%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.11%, rassenschande (racial defilement) 0.78%, other 0.20%. The list is one of the most important documents, preserved in the last moments of the camp operation by members of the Polish underground girl guides unit \\"Mury\\" (The Walls). The rest of the camp documents were burned by escaping SS overseers in pits or in the crematorium. Barracks on the grounds of the former women's camp Site of the former women's camp One form of resistance was the secret education programmes organised by prisoners for their fellow inmates. All national groups had some sort of programme. The most extensive were among Polish women, wherein various high school-level classes were taught by experienced teachers. In 1939 and 1940, camp living conditions were acceptable: laundry and bed linen were changed regularly and the food was adequate, although in the first winter of 1939/40, limitations began to be noticeable. The German Communist, Margarete Buber-Neumann, came to Ravensbr√ºck as an inmate after nearly two years in a Russian Soviet Gulag. She described her first impressions of Ravensbr√ºck in comparison to the Soviet camp in Karaganda: > I looked across the great square, and could not believe my eyes. It was > surrounded by manicured lawns, covered by flower beds on which bloomed > bright red flowers. A wide street, which led to a large open area, was > flanked by two rows of wooden barracks, on both sides stood rows of young > trees and along the roadside ran straight flower beds as far as the eye > could see. The square and the streets seemed freshly raked. To the left > towards the watchtower, I saw a white wooden barrack and beside it a large > cage, the size of a birdhouse the like you see at a zoo. Within it paraded > peacocks (stolzierten) and on a climbing tree dangled monkeys and a parrot > which always screamed the same word, \\"Mama\\". I wondered, \\"this is a > concentration camp\\"? Buber-Nuemann wrote how her first meal in Ravensbr√ºck exceeded her expectations, when she was served sweet porridge with dried fruit (backobst), plus a generous portion of bread, margarine, and sausage. Conditions quickly deteriorated. Elsie Mar√©chal, a young Belgian who worked with the Comet Line, was a prisoner at Ravensbr√ºck from 1943 to 1945. She described the conditions: > They didn‚Äôt shoot the women. We were to die of misery, hunger and > exhaustion...when we arrived at Ravensbr√ºck, it was the worst. The first > thing I saw was a cart with all the dead piled on it. Their arms and legs > hanging out, and mouths and eyes wide open. They reduced us to nothing. We > didn‚Äôt even feel like we had the value of cattle. You worked and you > died.Shute, Joe (14 Mar 2013), \\"The Secrets of the Second World War Comet > Line are revealed,\\" The Telegraph, , accessed 12 Oct 2019 Camp (external view), with guard house Former telephone exchange and water plant =Nazi medical experiments= Starting in the summer of 1942, medical experiments were conducted without consent on 86 women; 74 of them were Polish inmates. Two types of experiments were conducted on the Polish political prisoners. The first type tested the efficacy of sulfonamide drugs. These experiments involved deliberate cutting into and infecting of leg bones and muscles with virulent bacteria, cutting nerves, introducing substances like pieces of wood or glass into tissues, and fracturing bones. The second set of experiments studied bone, muscle, and nerve regeneration, and the possibility of transplanting bones from one person to another. Out of the 74 Polish victims, called Kaninchen, Kr√≥liki, Lapins, or Rabbits by the experimenters, five died as a result of the experiments, six with unhealed wounds were executed, and (with assistance from other inmates) the rest survived with permanent physical damage. Four such survivors‚ÄîJadwiga Dzido, Maria Broel- Plater, W≈Çadys≈Çawa Karolewska, and Maria Ku≈õmierczuk‚Äîtestified against Nazi doctors at the Doctors' Trial in 1946. Between 120 and 140 Romani women were sterilised in the camp in January 1945. All had been deceived into signing the consent form, having been told by the camp overseers that the German authorities would release them if they complied. =Forced labor= All inmates were required to do heavy labor ranging from strenuous outdoor jobs to building the V-2 rocket parts for Siemens. The SS also built several factories near Ravensbr√ºck for the production of textiles and electrical components. The women forced to work at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp's industries used their skills in sewing and their access to the factory to make soldiers' socks. They purposely adjusted the machines to make the fabric thin at the heel and the toes, causing the socks to wear prematurely at those places when the German soldiers marched. This gave the soldiers sore feet. For the women in the camp, it was important to retain some of their dignity and sense of humanity. Therefore, they made necklaces, bracelets, and other personal items, like small dolls and books, as keepsakes. These personal effects were of great importance to the women and many of them risked their lives to keep these possessions. Some of these types of effects can be seen at the exhibition \\"Voices from Ravensbr√ºck\\" (hosted by Lund University Library, Sweden). The bodies of those killed in the camp were cremated in the nearby F√ºrstenberg crematorium until 1943, when SS authorities constructed a crematorium at a site near the camp prison. In January 1945 the SS also transformed a hut near the crematorium into a gas chamber where the Germans gassed several thousand prisoners before the camp's liberation in April 1945; in particular they killed some 3600 prisoners from the Uckermark police camp for \\"deviant\\" girls and women, which was taken under the control of the Ravensbr√ºck SS at the start of 1945. Surviving female prisoners gathered when the Red Cross arrived at Ravensbr√ºck in April 1945. The white paint camp crosses show they were prisoners, not civilians.Margarete Buber-Neumann, Under Two Dictators. Prisoner of Stalin and Hitler, Pimlico, 2008. . \\"SS had no fabric for the production of new prison clothing. Instead they drove truckloads of coats, dresses, underwear and shoes that had once belonged to those gassed in the east, to Ravensbr√ºck. / ... / The clothes of the people were sorted, and at first crosses were cut out, and fabric of another colour sewn underneath. The prisoners walked around like sheep marked for slaughter. The crosses would impede escape. Later they spared themselves this cumbersome procedure and painted with oil paint broad, white crosses on the coats.\\" (translated from the Swedish edition: Margarete Buber-Neumann F√•nge hos Hitler och Stalin, Stockholm, Natur & Kultur, 1948. p. 176.) Death march and liberation In January 1945, prior to the liberation of the remaining camp survivors, an estimated 45,000 female prisoners and over 5,000 male prisoners remained at Ravensbr√ºck, including children and those transported from satellite camps only for gassing, which was being performed in haste. With the Soviet Red Army's rapid approach in the spring of 1945, the SS leadership decided to remove as many prisoners as they could, in order to avoid leaving live witnesses behind who could testify as to what had occurred in the camp. At the end of March, the SS ordered all physically capable women to form a column and exit the camp in the direction of northern Mecklenburg, forcing over 24,500 prisoners on a death march. Some 2,500 ethnic German prisoners remaining were released, and 500 women were handed over to officials of the Swedish and Danish Red Cross shortly after the evacuation. On 30 April 1945, fewer than 3,500 malnourished and sickly prisoners were discovered alive at the camp when it was liberated by the Red Army. The survivors of the death march were liberated in the following hours by a Soviet scout unit. Ravensbr√ºck trials The first Ravensbr√ºck trial, 1947: sentencing The SS guards, female Aufseherinnen guards and former prisoner-functionaries with administrative positions at the camp were arrested at the end of the war by the Allies and tried at the Hamburg Ravensbr√ºck trials from 1946 to 1948. 16 of the accused were found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. Memorial site On the site of the former concentration camp there is a memorial today. In 1954, the sculptor Will Lammert was commissioned to design the memorial site between the crematorium, the camp wall, and Schwedtsee Lake. Up to his death in 1957, the artist created a large number of sculpted models of women. Will Lammert, memorial statue Tragende (Woman with Burden), 1959 For the inaugural opening of the National Memorial site a scaled-up version of Tragende (Woman with Burden) was created (under the supervision of Fritz Cremer) and exhibited. This central symbolic figure, also known as the \\"Piet√† of Ravensbr√ºck\\", stands atop a stele on the peninsula in Lake Schwedtsee. The Zwei Stehende (Two Women Standing) monument also has its origins in Lammert's models. Other statues, which were also originally created for Ravensbr√ºck, have been on display at the Old Jewish Cemetery in Berlin Mitte since 1985, in commemoration of the Jewish victims of fascism. Statue, 2005 Since 1984, the former SS headquarters have housed the Museum des antifaschistischen Widerstandskampfes (Museum of Anti-fascist Resistance). After the withdrawal from Germany of the Soviet Army, which up to 1993 had been using parts of the former camp for military purposes, it became possible to incorporate more areas of the camp into the memorial site. Today, the former accommodation blocks for the female guards are a youth hostel and youth meeting centre. In the course of reorganisation, which took place in the early 1990s, the Museum des antifaschistischen Widerstandskampfes was replaced by two new permanent exhibitions: \\"Women of Ravensbr√ºck\\", which displays the biographies of 27 former prisoners, and \\"Ravensbr√ºck. Topography and History of the Women's Concentration Camp\\", which provides information about the origins of the camp, describes daily life in the camp, and explains the principle of Vernichtung durch Arbeit (extermination through work). Since 2004 there has also been an exhibition about the female guards at the Ravensbr√ºck Women's Concentration Camp, housed in another of their former accommodation blocks. Additionally, temporary exhibitions of special interest are held regularly at the memorial. On 16 and 17 April 2005, a ceremony was held to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the camp's liberation. Among those invited were approximately 600 survivors from all over the world, mostly eastern Europe. At the same time a new, permanent outdoor exhibition was opened, on the theme of the train transports to Ravensbr√ºck. Its central exhibit is a refurbished goods wagon. The exhibition's information boards describe the origins of the transports and how they developed over time, and explain the different types of trains, where they arrived, and the part played by the local residents. It is probably the only exhibition so far at a German memorial which is dedicated solely to the subject of the transports to the camp.

It is located to the north of Chetpet railway station. It is the only existing lake at the centre of the city. The lake belongs to the Department of Fisheries of the Tamil Nadu government. Of the total area of the lake, the waterbody is spread across 9.1 acres and the land area covers 6.9 acres. An anglers club was functioning till the 1940s in the lake, whose members visited the small island in the midst of the waterbody for fishing. Although not used for drinking purposes, the lake was a source of groundwater recharge for the surrounding areas. As the water quality is not saline, the lake has a few varieties of fishes such as rohu, catla and mrigal. Breeding is monitored to assess the water quality. History In 1934, the lake was taken over by the Department of Fisheries to conduct research. In the following decade, a hydro-biological research station was set up to conduct studies in fisheries. Fishing as a sporting activity began at the lake with the formation of Madras Anglers Club in 1962. In the dry summer months of 2019, about 4,500 cubic metres of silt was dredged. These were used to strengthen the bund. The lake today In recent years, the lake has been heavily encroached upon, particularly near the Chetpet railway station. There have been many plans to rejuvenate Chetpet lake since the mid-1990s, including developing a boat club, an aquarium, seafood stall and fish court besides a walkway around the waterbody. The last attempt to save the lake was in 2005, when the state environment department identified it along with 12 other lakes of Greater Chennai area for an eco-restoration project. The CPR Environmental Education Centre conducted a detailed survey, and based on that, the state government appointed the Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Finance Services Limited to prepare a project report. The State government had sanctioned 4 million to clean the overgrown water hyacinth and desilt the lake in 2007‚Äì2008. Developments In May 2012, the Chennai Corporation Council adopted a resolution to construct a 1,475-m-long stormwater drain from the lake to the Cooum river at a cost of 22.9 million to carry excess water during monsoon. The drain would pass through New Bhoopathy Nagar, Pachaiyappa's College play ground and Venkatachalapathy Street. This is to prevent flooding in the Kilpauk Medical College area. Map of Chetpet Lake and Eco Park A building to house a stall of the Fisheries Development Corporation is also coming up by the side of the lake at a cost of 60 million. The three-storey building will comprise two fish heads, facing north and west, joined by a fin and a tail. The heads will be made of light-weight material. The building will accommodate the offices of the Tamil Nadu Fisheries Development Corporation, Tamil Nadu State Apex Fisheries Cooperative Federation and the chief engineer of the fisheries department. In April 2013, Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa announced developing the lake with facilities for angling, water sports, boating and open-air auditoriums at a cost of 420 million. The lake shore will have an eco park with 1.5-km long track for walkers and joggers and children's play area, in addition to a seafood restaurant and multilevel parking space to accommodate 200 cars. The eco-park is dotted with 30 stone sculptures. Other facilities include acupressure walkway, elevation aquarium, 3D film show, and a virtual reality centre on marine life. Parts of the project include an elevated link between Chetpet railway station and the eco park, infrastructure connecting Poonamallee High Road with the park, and construction of a box culvert beneath the railway tracks to connect the lake with Cooum River near Spur Tank Road. The park is being planned in a 15-acre area adjoining the lake. The foundation stone for the park was laid in June 2014.

Elected by the Federal Assembly for one year, the officeholder chairs the meetings of the Federal Council and undertakes special representational duties. First among equals, the president of the Confederation has no powers over and above the other six councillors and continues to head the assigned department. Traditionally the duty rotates among the members in order of seniority; the vice president of the Federal Council assumes the presidency the year after the officeholder's tenure. The president of the Confederation is not the head of state because the entire Federal Council is the collective head of state. The constitutional provisions relating to the organisation of the Federal Government and federal administration are set out in Section 1 Organisation and Procedure of Chapter 3 Federal Council and Federal Administration of the Title 5 Federal Authorities of the Swiss Federal Constitution at articles 174 to 179. Article 176 specifically relates to the presidency. Competencies The Swiss president is not ‚Äì as are, for example, the presidents in Austria or Germany ‚Äì the head of state of the country: under the Swiss Federal Constitution, the Federal Council doubles as a collective head of state and head of government. When a tied vote occurs in the council (which may happen, since on the one hand abstention is permitted, and on the other hand a meeting of the council can take place without all members present), his or her vote is worth double.Government and Administration Organisation Act, Art. 19. In addition to the control of his or her own department, the president carries out some of the representative duties that are normally carried out by a single head of state in other democracies. For example, since joining the United Nations, Swiss presidents have on occasion spoken at inaugural sessions of the General Assembly along with other visiting heads of state and government. However, because the Swiss have no single head of state, the country carries out no state visits. When traveling abroad, the president does so only in their capacity as head of their department. Visiting heads of state are received by the seven members of the Federal Council together, rather than by the president of the Confederation. Treaties are signed on behalf of the full council, with all Federal Council members signing letters of credence and other documents of the kind. Election The president is elected by the Federal Assembly from the Federal Council for a term of one year. In the nineteenth century, the election as federal president was an award for especially esteemed Federal Council members. However, a few less influential members of the government were regularly passed over. One such example was Wilhelm Matthias Naeff, who ‚Äì although a member of the Federal Council for 27 years ‚Äì was federal president only once, in 1853. Since the twentieth century, the election has usually not been disputed. There is an unwritten rule that the member of the Federal Council who has not been federal president the longest becomes President. Therefore, every Federal Council member gets a turn at least once every seven years. The only question in the elections that provides some tension is the question of how many votes the person who is to be elected president receives. This is seen as a popularity test. In the 1970s and 1980s, 200 votes (of 246 possible) was seen as an excellent result, but in the current era of growing party-political conflicts, 180 votes are a respectable outcome. Until 1920, it was customary for the serving federal president to also lead the Department of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, every year there was a moving around of posts, as the retiring president returned to his former department and the new president took up the foreign affairs portfolio. Likewise, it was traditional for the federal president not to leave Switzerland during their year in office.

It provides that state courts are bound by, and state constitutions subordinate to, the supreme law. However, federal statutes and treaties are supreme only if they do not contravene the Constitution. In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain federal acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with federal law, but when federal law conflicts with the Constitution that law is null and void. In this respect, the Supremacy Clause follows the lead of Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, which provided that \\"Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in Congress Assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.\\" A constitutional provision announcing the supremacy of federal law, the Supremacy Clause assumes the underlying priority of federal authority, only when that authority is expressed in the Constitution itself. No matter what the federal government or the states might wish to do, they have to stay within the boundaries of the Constitution. This makes the Supremacy Clause the cornerstone of the whole U.S. political structure. Text Background =Constitutional Convention= In Madison's Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, the Supremacy Clause is introduced as part of the New Jersey Plan. During the debate, it is first put up for a motion by Luther Martin on July 17th where it passed unanimously. During Pennsylvania's ratifying convention in late-1787, James Wilson stated, \\"the power of the Constitution predominates. Any thing, therefore, that shall be enacted by Congress contrary thereto, will not have the force of law.\\"James Wilson, Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, 1787 =The Federalist Papers= In Federalist No. 33, Alexander Hamilton writes about the Supremacy Clause that federal laws by definition must be supreme. If the laws do not function from that position then they amount to nothing, noting that \\"A law, by the very meaning of the term, includes supremacy. It is a rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound to observe. This results from every political association. If individuals enter into a state of society, the laws of that society must be the supreme regulator of their conduct. If a number of political societies enter into a larger political society, the laws which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers entrusted to it by its constitution, must necessarily be supreme over those societies, and the individuals of whom they are composed.\\" In Federalist No. 44, James Madison defends the Supremacy Clause as vital to the functioning of the nation. He noted that state legislatures were invested with all powers not specifically defined in the Constitution, but also said that having the federal government subservient to various state constitutions would be an inversion of the principles of government, concluding that if supremacy were not established \\"it would have seen the authority of the whole society everywhere subordinate to the authority of the parts; it would have seen a monster, in which the head was under the direction of the members\\". Alexander Hamilton, wrote in Federalist #78 that, \\"There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.\\"Alexander Hamilton, Federalist #78 Preemption doctrine The constitutional principle derived from the Supremacy Clause is federal preemption. Preemption applies regardless of whether the conflicting laws come from legislatures, courts, administrative agencies, or constitutions. For example, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, an act of Congress, preempts state constitutions, and Food and Drug Administration regulations may preempt state court judgments in cases involving prescription drugs. Congress has preempted state regulation in many areas. In some cases, such as the 1976 Medical Device Regulation Act, Congress preempted all state regulation. In others, such as labels on prescription drugs, Congress allowed federal regulatory agencies to set federal minimum standards, but did not preempt state regulations imposing more stringent standards than those imposed by federal regulators. Where rules or regulations do not clearly state whether or not preemption should apply, the Supreme Court tries to follow lawmakers‚Äô intent, and prefers interpretations that avoid preempting state laws. Supreme Court interpretations In Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796), the United States Supreme Court for the first time applied the Supremacy Clause to strike down a state statute. Virginia had passed a statute during the Revolutionary War allowing the state to confiscate debt payments by Virginia citizens to British creditors. The Supreme Court found that this Virginia statute was inconsistent with the Treaty of Paris with Britain, which protected the rights of British creditors. Relying on the Supremacy Clause, the Supreme Court held that the treaty superseded Virginia's statute, and that it was the duty of the courts to declare Virginia's statute \\"null and void\\". In Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot pass laws that are contrary to the Constitution, and it is the role of the Judicial system to interpret what the Constitution permits. Citing the Supremacy Clause, the Court found Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 to be unconstitutional to the extent it purported to enlarge the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court beyond that permitted by the Constitution. In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304 (1816), and Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264 (1821), the Supreme Court held that the Supremacy Clause and the judicial power granted in Article III give the Supreme Court the ultimate power to review state court decisions involving issues arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Therefore, the Supreme Court has the final say in matters involving federal law, including constitutional interpretation, and can overrule decisions by state courts. In McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), the Supreme Court reviewed a tax levied by Maryland on the federally incorporated Bank of the United States. The Court found that if a state had the power to tax a federally incorporated institution, then the state effectively had the power to destroy the federal institution, thereby thwarting the intent and purpose of Congress. This would make the states superior to the federal government. The Court found that this would be inconsistent with the Supremacy Clause, which makes federal law superior to state law. The Court therefore held that Maryland's tax on the bank was unconstitutional because the tax violated the Supremacy Clause. In Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. 506 (1859), the Supreme Court held that state courts cannot issue rulings that contradict the decisions of federal courts, citing the Supremacy Clause, and overturning a decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. Specifically, the court found it was illegal for state officials to interfere with the work of U.S. Marshals enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act or to order the release of federal prisoners held for violation of that Act. The Supreme Court reasoned that because the Supremacy Clause established federal law as the law of the land, the Wisconsin courts could not nullify the judgments of a federal court. The Supreme Court held that under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts have the final jurisdiction in all cases involving the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the states therefore cannot interfere with federal court judgments. In Pennsylvania v. Nelson, 350 U.S. 497 (1956) the Supreme Court struck down the Pennsylvania Sedition Act, which made advocating the forceful overthrow of the federal government a crime under Pennsylvania state law. The Supreme Court held that when federal interest in an area of law is sufficiently dominant, federal law must be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject; and a state law is not to be declared a help when state law goes farther than Congress has seen fit to go. In Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), the Supreme Court held that international treaties and laws made pursuant to them must comply with the Constitution. In Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), the Supreme Court rejected attempts by Arkansas to nullify the Court's school desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education. The state of Arkansas, acting on a theory of states' rights, had adopted several statutes designed to nullify the desegregation ruling. The Supreme Court relied on the Supremacy Clause to hold that the federal law controlled and could not be nullified by state statutes or officials. In Edgar v. MITE Corp., , the Supreme Court ruled: \\"A state statute is void to the extent that it actually conflicts with a valid Federal statute\\". In effect, this means that a State law will be found to violate the Supremacy Clause when either of the following two conditions (or both) exist:Dow Chemical Co. v. Exxon Corp., 139 F.3d 1470 (Fed Cir 1998). # Compliance with both the Federal and State laws is impossible # \\"State law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\\" In 1920, the Supreme Court applied the Supremacy Clause to international treaties, holding in the case of Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, that the Federal government's ability to make treaties is supreme over any state concerns that such treaties might abrogate states' rights arising under the Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has also held that only specific, \\"unmistakable\\" acts of Congress may be held to trigger the Supremacy Clause. Montana had imposed a 30 percent tax on most sub-bituminous coal mined there. The Commonwealth Edison Company and other utility companies argued, in part, that the Montana tax \\"frustrated\\" the broad goals of the federal energy policy. However, in the case of Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, , the Supreme Court disagreed. Any appeal to claims about \\"national policy\\", the Court said, were insufficient to overturn a state law under the Supremacy Clause unless \\"the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained\\".Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609, 634, quoting Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142 (1963). However, in the case of California v. ARC America Corp., , the Supreme Court held that if Congress expressly intended to act in an area, this would trigger the enforcement of the Supremacy Clause, and hence nullify the state action. The Supreme Court further found in Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, , that even when a state law is not in direct conflict with a federal law, the state law could still be found unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause if the \\"state law is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of Congress's full purposes and objectives\\".Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 372-374. Congress need not expressly assert any preemption over state laws either, because Congress may implicitly assume this preemption under the Constitution.Crosby v.

The first of forefathers by cultivating in one's own mother tongue, custom and culture, especially in Manipur. The Apokpa has no name, but different communities call or invoke Him in their own language as God. It is a main cult in the religion of Sanamahism, the religion of Ancient Kanglei world. Worship Apokpa Laining does not have idol worship, so community worship is in the form of Khubam symbolic representations in demarcated places where articles for worship are placed. Apokpaism worship takes place with Meiteis rites and rituals maintaining all customary norms. Main Followers- Meiteis The Meitei believe in two categories of deities: * Yumlai: Leimaren, Sanamahee and Apokpa (deities of dwelling houses) * Umanglai: (deities of woods: i.e., deities outside the dwelling houses). Not only the Apokpa community but all the Meiteis generally worship Yumlai and Umanglai. Beliefs The first human species was created by Lainingthou Sanamahi, the incarnation of Eepuroi Apokpa by observing the image of Soraren and then spread human beings and inhabited all over the earth. Laninghan declared that Meetei-Laibak is the first habitation land of human beings and it is not only a paradise for the Meiteis, but also for other human beings on the earth. He declared that as long as the Meiteis' \\"Chayon-Taret\\" (seven days of week) exist, the history of the Meiteis will not become extinct. =The Chayon- Taret= *The first day of the week. The day on which Lainingthou Soraren came down from Koubru and reached the foot of the Nongmaiching Hill to create land for human habitation was called \\"Nongmaiching\\". *The second day of the week. The day Lainingthou Soraren climbed the hill top was called \\"Ningthoukaba\\" ( = king; = climb). *The third day of the week. The day the earth was visible over water surface was called \\"Leibakpokpa\\" ( = earth; = birth). *The fourth day of the week. The day the deities started to build their dwelling houses was called \\"YumsaKeisa\\" ( = house; = to build). *The fifth day of the week. The \\"Haos\\" became jealous at this and they started attacking the deities to drive them away. The deities got on their horseback and began to fight. The day the deities fought the battle riding on horseback was called \\"Sagonsen\\" ( = horse; = to ride). *The sixth day of the week.

Except for the addition of a built-in hard drive and extra expansion slots, it is very similar to the original PC.  Name  IBM did not specify an expanded form of \\"XT\\" on the machine, press releases, brochures or documentation, but some publications expanded the term as \\"eXtended Technology\\" or just \\"eXTended\\".  Features  The XT was regarded as an incremental improvement over the PC and a disappointment compared to the next-generation successor that some had anticipated. Compared to the original IBM PC, the XT has the following major differences: * The number of expansion slots is increased from five to eight * Base RAM is increased to at least 128KB * A 10MB hard drive is included as standard equipment * PC DOS 2.0 is included Otherwise the specifications are identical to the original PC. = Expansion slots = The number of expansion slots in the original IBM PC was a limiting factor for the product, since essential components (such as the video controller, disk controller and printer interface) each came as separate expansion cards and could quickly fill up all available slots, requiring the user to swap cards in and out as tasks demanded. Some PC clones addressed this problem by integrating components into the motherboard to free up slots, while peripheral manufacturers produced products which integrated multiple functions into one card. The XT addressed the problem by adding three extra expansion slots for a total of eight. While the slots themselves are identical to those in the original PC, the amount of physical space in the chassis differs, so two of the new slots (located behind the hard drive) cannot accept full-length cards. In addition, the spacing of the slots is narrower than in the original PC, making it impossible to install some multi-board cards. = Expansion unit = The 5161 is an expansion chassis using an identical case and power supply to the XT, but instead of a system board, provides a backplane with eight card slots. It connects to the main system unit using an Extender Card in the system unit and a Receiver Card in the Expansion Unit, connected by a custom cable. The 5161 shipped with a 10 MB hard drive, and had room for a second one. The Expansion Unit can also contain extra memory, but the Extender card inserts wait states for memory in the Expansion Unit, so it may be preferable to install memory into the main system unit. The 5161 can be connected to either an XT or to the earlier 5150 (the original IBM PC).Personal Computer Family Service Information Manual (January 1989), IBM document SA38-0037-00, pages 7-1 to 7-3 = Other features = PC DOS 2.0 offers a 9-sector floppy disk format, providing 180K/360K (single- vs. dual-sided) capacity per disk, compared to the 160K/320K provided by the 8-sector format of previous releases. The XT was not offered in a floppy-only model for its first two years on the market, although the standard ribbon cable with two floppy connectors was still included. At that time, in order to get a second floppy drive, the user had to purchase the 5161 expansion chassis. Like the original PC, the XT comes with IBM BASIC in ROM. The XT BIOS also displays a memory count during the POST, unlike the original PC. The XT has a desktop case similar to that of the IBM PC. It weighs and was approximately wide by deep by high. The power supply is 130 watts, an upgrade from the original PC. Those sold in the US are configured for 120 V AC only and could not be used with 240 V mains supplies.Scott Mueller, \\"Upgrading and Repairing PCs 2nd Edition\\" Que Books, 1992 , pp. 59-79 XTs with 240 V-compatible power supplies were later sold in international markets. Both were rated at 130 watts. Revisions and variants IBM PC XT 5160 Dual Floppy Drives with 5153 Color MonitorIBM made several submodels of the XT. The 3270 PC, a variant of the XT featuring 3270 terminal emulation, was released in October 1983. Submodel 068 and 078, released in 1985, offered dual-floppy configurations without a hard drive as well, and the new Enhanced Graphics Adapter and Professional Graphics Adapter became available as video card options. In 1986, the 256‚Äì640 KB motherboard models were launched, which switched to half-height drives. Submodels 268, 278 and 089 came with 101-key keyboards (essentially the IBM Model M, but in a modified variant that used the XT's keyboard protocol and lacked LEDs). Submodels 267, 277 and 088 had the original keyboard, but 3.5\\" floppy drives became available and 20MB Seagate ST-225 hard disks in 5.25\\" half-height size replaced the full-height 10MB drives. Submodel 788 was the only XT sold with the Color Graphics Adapter as a standard feature. Submodels 568, 588, and 589 were used as basis for the XT/370; they had an additional (co-)processor board that could execute System/370 instructions.Personal Computer Family Service Information Manual (January 1989), IBM document SA38-0037-00, page 6-2 An XT- based machine with a Series/1 co-processor board existed as well, but it had its own System Unit number, the IBM 4950.Personal Computer Family Service Information Manual (January 1989), IBM document SA38-0037-00, page 14-1 = IBM XT 286 = In 1986 the XT 286 (model 5162) was released with a 6 MHz Intel 80286 processor. Despite being marketed as a lower-tier model than the IBM AT, this system runs many applications faster than the ATs of the time with 6 MHz 286 processors, since it has zero-wait state RAM. It shipped with 640 KB RAM standard, an AT-style 1.2 MB high-density diskette drive and a 20 MB hard disk.Personal Computer Family Service Information Manual (January 1989), IBM document SA38-0037-00, pages 8-1 to 8-2The AT Clone from IBM, PC Magazine, January 13, 1987 Despite these features, reviews rated it as a poor market value. The XT 286 uses a 157-watt power supply, which can internally switch between 115 or 230 V AC operation. Reception The XT was well received, although PC DOS 2.0 was regarded as a greater improvement than any of the hardware changes, and by the end of 1983 IBM was selling every unit they made. The XT was discontinued in the spring of 1987. See also *Amiga Sidecar *PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes#Personal Computer XT/370 References ;Notes *IBM (1983).

Of the 41 passengers and four crew members, only 17 passengers and one crew member survived. One person was killed and six were injured on the ground. Flight history Flight 458 was a regularly scheduled flight that originated in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and stopped at Wausau, Green Bay, Manitowoc and Milwaukee, Wisconsin before terminating at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. On December 27, 1968, the flight left Minneapolis on schedule at 4:15 p.m. Central Standard Time, and made its intermediate stops without incident. However, delays caused by weather and baggage handling meant that by the time the plane departed General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee at 7:48 p.m. CST for the final leg of its flight to Chicago, it was running 62 minutes behind schedule. At 8:14 p.m. CST, the aircraft began its approach to O'Hare, which had a ceiling with light rain and fog, and runway visibility varying from . The plane made a normal approach, and at 8:20 p.m. CST, it was cleared to land on Runway 14R. The flight crew acknowledged the clearance message; it was the last communication with Flight 458. The approach continued normally until about from the threshold of the runway, when from an altitude of about , the CV-580 began a sustained climb for 11 seconds, after which the captain initiated a go-around procedure. However, the aircraft instead continued to climb; witnesses reported that the engines were running at a high throttle setting and that the aircraft rolled left and right two or three times during this time period. Flight 458 lost speed until it stalled 13 seconds after the initiation of the go-around. The aircraft entered a steep left bank, and its left wing struck the ground about from a hangar located 1,600 feet (488 meters) to the left of the runway. At 8:22:23 p.m. CST, the plane, now nearly inverted, struck the main door of the hangar with its left wing and crashed into the hangar bay. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Convair CV-580 (registration N2045), c/n 369, which Convair had completed as a CV-440 Metropolitan on October 8, 1956. It was converted to a standard CV-580 in July 1968. As a CV-580, it entered service with North Central Airlines on August 9, 1968. The crash damaged the aircraft beyond repair. Casualties Three crew members - the captain, the first officer and a flight attendant - and 24 passengers died in the crash. One crew member (a flight attendant) and 17 passengers survived, all with injuries. Several airline employees, as well as members of a drum and bugle corps group, were on the ground in the vicinity of the hangar or in the hangar bay at the time of the crash; none of the airline employees were harmed, but seven of the boys were injured, and one of them died nine days later. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board conducted an investigation of the accident that lasted almost 23 months. Its report, released on November 12, 1970, blamed the crash on \\"Spatial disorientation of the captain precipitated by atmospheric refraction of either the approach lights or landing lights at a critical point in the approach wherein the crew was transitioning between flying by reference to flight instruments and by visual reference to the ground.\\" The NTSB noted that the captain of Flight 458, although experienced, had relatively few hours of experience as the pilot-in-command in CV-580s and that a captain more experienced with the CV-580 might have recognized the growing danger of a stall sooner and avoided the crash. It recommended that Federal Aviation Administration regulations be amended to require pilots to have more flying hours and landing experience in a given type of aircraft before being released from \\"high minima\\" landing requirements when serving as pilot-in-command in that type.

In 2016, Kelly was a member of garage rock musician Ty Segall's backing band The Muggers, formed following the release of the studio album, Emotional Mugger. Continuing to work with Segall, Kelly contributed to the recording of his ninth studio album, Ty Segall (2017), and is currently a member of his backing band, The Freedom Band. Music Emmett‚Äôs primary focus is his band, The Cairo Gang, which released its self-titled debut album on Narnack Records in 2006. The Disneyland Reform Party, a label started by Kelly and New York artist, Stasiu Tokarski, released 2008‚Äôs Twyxt Wyrd, which was subsequently released as a limited edition LP by Sheffield, UK‚Äôs The Blackest Rainbow. Following Twyxt Wyrd, Kelly released the home recorded Holy Clover EP on San Francisco‚Äôs Empty Cellar Records and Coventry, UK‚Äôs Tin Angel. Empty Cellar subsequently released 2012's The Corner Man, and 2013's Tiny Rebels, which marked a significant shift in approach. Since 2013 he has been based in Los Angeles and has released albums for The Cairo Gang on Ty Segall's Drag City imprint, God? Records. The first, 2015's Goes Missing, was recorded largely in transit and even at times in his van. It includes performances by live Cairo Gang drummer Marc Riordan. 2016 saw the release of a collaboration of post apocalyptic neo folk songs with composer Rob Mazurek entitled Alien Flower Sutra on International Anthem. In 2017, The Cairo Gang released their first \\"studio\\" album, Untouchable. Untouchable was recorded by Ty Segall, who also plays the drums. Bassist Shayde Sartin and live Cairo Gang bassist Ryan Weinstein also contribute. 2017 also saw the release of Dawn Of The Double on In the Red Records. Kelly founded improvisational ensemble, Clinamen, in 2018 with perennial collaborators Marc Riordan and Ben Boye. 2018 also saw the introduction of The C.I.A. (In the Red Records), an experimental punk trio fronted by Den√©e Segall and featuring Emmett Kelly and Ty Segall on electric bass guitars. The Cairo Gang has toured with notable acts such as The Fall, OCS, Baby Dee, and Pillars and Tongues. Kelly has been a frequent collaborator of Will Oldham (A.K.A. Bonnie ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù Billy), and has lent his vocals and guitar to his recordings and performances since Oldham‚Äôs 2006 album, The Letting Go. In 2010 Drag City released the critically acclaimed album, The Wonder Show of the World, which featured compositional work by Kelly as The Cairo Gang, along with the single, Midday/You Win, and the 10‚Äô‚Äô, Island Brothers/New Wonder.

They were founded in 1845 in Lviv, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and now in Ukraine, the first such organization of religious women in this Eastern Catholic Church. The founders were the Blessed Josaphata Hordashevska and the Servant of God, Father Jeremiah Lomnytskyj, O.S.B.M.. They are a different religious institute than the Congregation of Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate founded by Honorat Ko≈∫mi≈Ñski. Roots The Ukrainian Catholic Church was formed in 1595 through the Union of Brest, when several bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the King of Poland, agreed to enter into full communion with the Holy See of Rome. The adherents of this union were a minority within the general Ukrainian population, with strong hostility coming from the adherents of the Orthodox Church. Ukrainian Catholics retained the traditions of Orthodox Church institutions, one of which was an enclosed religious order as the sole approved option for women who wanted to live a religious lifestyle. They were, however, also in touch with the ecclesiastical developments of Western Europe. Father Jeremiah Lomnytskyj, a Basilian monk, was among the first members of his religious Order trained under Polish Jesuit Fathers. From his experiences with the Polish Roman Catholics, Lomnytskyj conceived the idea of establishing communities of active Religious Sisters to assist the Basilian Fathers in answering the great social needs of the people, as had emerged throughout Western Europe during that era. Lomnytskyj was invited in 1891 by Father Cyril Sielecki, a widowed priest, to give a mission at the parish of Zhuzhel (now called Zhuzheliany) where he was leaving as pastor. The mission was very well received, and he was approached by several young girls who wanted to give their lives to God. When he indicated that the usual dowry would be needed for admission to a monastery, one girl indicated that she was too poor for that. Lomnytskyj was troubled by this. Michaelina Hordashevska, later to be known as Mother Josaphata, had already been discerning a religious vocation. Fr. Lomnytskyj acted as her spiritual director in Lviv, and under his guidance, she made a private vow of chastity.\\"Blessed Michaelina Josaphata Hordashevska, SSMI\\", SSMI Lomnytskyj now pondered whether she could be instrumental in realizing this goal of establishing active religious communities of women in their Church, beginning with these several young women. He then invited her to become the first member of this new way of life he was proposing, which he and Seletsky would direct, advising her that there would be much work and suffering ahead. Michaelina accepted his invitation.Many sites indicate that Michaelina had entered a Basilian monastery first. According to her Congregation, this is incorrect. She was called in a different direction from the outset. Foundation of the Congregation In June 1892, Michaelina Hordashevska went to stay with the Polish Roman Catholic Felician Sisters, a fairly new congregation which had been founded with a similar goal by a Polish noblewoman. After two months, she returned to her native city of Lviv on 22 August, and fashioned the religious habit which was to distinguish the new Congregation. Two days later, she was formally given this habit and the religious name Josaphata, in honor of the revered Ukrainian Catholic martyr, Saint Josaphat. Hordashevka then went to the nearby village of Zhuzhel (site of the parish mission where seven other young women who had been recruited for this new community were waiting to establish a community. They then began their preparation to start their lives of service. Sister Josaphata was appointed Superior of the community. She taught and encouraged the other members of the community, telling them: \\"Serve your people where the need is greatest\\". Within ten years, the 8 Sisters had grown to 128, living in 26 convents throughout Ukraine. They were able to hold their first General Chapter in 1902, in the course of which Sister Josaphata Hordashevka was elected the first Superior General of the Congregation, with Father Jeremiah Lomnytskyj resigning his position as Director of the institute. Unfortunately, severe divisions arose within the Congregation, driving Hordashevka to submit her resignation soon afterwards to the Metropolitan Archbishop of Lviv, the Servant of God Andrey Sheptytsky, O.S.B.M., who accepted it and appointed a new Superior General. After this, Sister Josaphata was denied permission to make permanent vows, until the next General Chapter went ahead and voted her as Vicaress General of the Congregation, despite her ineligibility for the office due to her canonical status. The delegates of the Chapter petitioned the Metropolitan to allow her to make her final vows, a petition which was granted and she assumed the post. Three years later, though, Mother Josaphata was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the bone. She died from this disease in 1919, at the age of 49. Growth and persecution The Sisters Servants had been founded to minister to the spiritual, moral, intellectual and social needs of the Ukrainian people. As many of them emigrated to other countries over the years, in search of a better life, the Sisters branched out from western Ukraine to Canada, Yugoslavia, Brazil, the United States, Poland, Slovakia, Italy, Great Britain, France, Argentina, Germany, Australia and Kazakhstan. After World War II, however, Ukraine was absorbed into the Soviet Union. The Communist government which took control of the region soon suppressed the Sisters and seized their properties, as well as that of all other religious institutions. The Sisters were forced to live hidden lives of dedication. The Superior General at that time, Mother Veronica Gargil, was able to flee the Soviet Union with another member of the General Council, first to Czechoslovakia, then, in 1945, to Rome. Shortly after that, the Canadian Province of the Congregation was able to purchase property, which was established as the international motherhouse of the Congregation. Mother Josaphata's remains were exhumed in 1982 and transferred to the Generalate in Rome. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Sisters who had lived their consecrated lives in secret were able to re-emerge as a public association. Members of the Congregation from throughout the world joined together to give support and help to their Sisters in Ukraine. Present day In 1992 the Congregation celebrated the centennial of its founding with Sisters Servants from thirteen countries participating in a Divine Liturgy of Thanksgiving and a special Jubilee program held in Ukraine. On 6 April 1998, Pope John Paul II issued the decree acknowledging Mother Josaphata's heroic virtues, and the occurrence of a miracle effected through intercession to her. She was beatified on 27 June 2001, during a visit by that Pope to her native city of Lviv, along with another member of the Congregation who had been murdered by a Soviet soldier and over twenty other martyrs of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. As of 2018, there are about 700 sisters serving in Brazil, Canada, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Ukraine, the United States. The headquarters are in Rome. In the United States, the sisters operate St. Joseph‚Äôs Adult Care Home in Sloatsburg, New York.Matsuda, Akiko. \\"Sloatsburg nuns put 52-room estate up for sale for nest egg\\", Rockland/Westchester Journal News, September 10, 2018 Notes External sources *Website of the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate *Saints SPQN *The Vatican website Category:1892 establishments in Austria-Hungary Category:Christian women's organizations Category:Members of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Category:Christian religious orders established in the 19th century Category:Eastern Catholic orders and societies ","title":"Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate"},{"id":"33731100","text":"P21, p21 or P-21 may refer to: * The p21/waf1 protein, also known as cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor 1 or CDK-interacting protein 1 * The p21/ras protein, part of the RAt Sarcoma family of proteins * , a patrol vessel of the Irish Navy * ARA King (P-21), an Argentine Navy minelayer and patrol ship commissioned in 1946 * Maltese patrol boat P21 * Partnership for 21st Century Learning, also Partnership for 21st Century Skills, see 21st century skills * P21 road (Ukraine) See also * Curtiss XP-21, an American fighter aircraft of the 1920s ","title":"P21 (disambiguation)"},{"id":"33731132","text":"Gas Metal Arc Welding \\"Mig\\" Welding Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), sometimes referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable MIG wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join. Along with the wire electrode, a shielding gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from atmospheric contamination. The process can be semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, each of which has distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations. Originally developed in the 1940s for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous materials, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW is the most common industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of moving air. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux. Development The principles of gas metal arc welding began to be understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It was not until the 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used direct current with a bare electrode wire and used arc voltage to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use. In 1948, GMAW was developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere was developed, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation. The spray-arc transfer variation was developed in the early 1960s, when experimenters added small amounts of oxygen to inert gases. More recently, pulsed current has been applied, giving rise to a new method called the pulsed spray-arc variation. GMAW is one of the most popular welding methods, especially in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, where robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to accelerate manufacturing. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding. Equipment To perform gas metal arc welding, the basic necessary equipment is a welding gun, a wire feed unit, a welding power supply, a welding electrode wire, and a shielding gas supply. =Welding gun and wire feed unit= GMAW torch nozzle cutaway image. (1) Torch handle, (2) Molded phenolic dielectric (shown in white) and threaded metal nut insert (yellow), (3) Shielding gas diffuser, (4) Contact tip, (5) Nozzle output face GMAW on stainless steel Mig welding station The typical GMAW welding gun has a number of key parts--a control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an electrode conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations. The wire feed unit supplies the electrode to the work, driving it through the conduit and on to the contact tip. Most models provide the wire at a constant feed rate, but more advanced machines can vary the feed rate in response to the arc length and voltage. Some wire feeders can reach feed rates as high as 30 m/min (1200 in/min), but feed rates for semiautomatic GMAW typically range from 2 to 10 m/min (75 ‚Äì 400 in/min). =Tool style= The most common electrode holder is a semiautomatic air-cooled holder. Compressed air circulates through it to maintain moderate temperatures. It is used with lower current levels for welding lap or butt joints. The second most common type of electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where the only difference is that water takes the place of air. It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder‚Äîwhich is typically used with automated equipment.. =Power supply= Most applications of gas metal arc welding use a constant voltage power supply. As a result, any change in arc length (which is directly related to voltage) results in a large change in heat input and current. A shorter arc length causes a much greater heat input, which makes the wire electrode melt more quickly and thereby restore the original arc length. This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand-held welding guns. To achieve a similar effect, sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage-controlled wire feed unit. In this case, a change in arc length makes the wire feed rate adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length. In rare circumstances, a constant current power source and a constant wire feed rate unit might be coupled, especially for the welding of metals with high thermal conductivities, such as aluminum. This grants the operator additional control over the heat input into the weld, but requires significant skill to perform successfully. Alternating current is rarely used with GMAW; instead, direct current is employed and the electrode is generally positively charged. Since the anode tends to have a greater heat concentration, this results in faster melting of the feed wire, which increases weld penetration and welding speed. The polarity can be reversed only when special emissive-coated electrode wires are used, but since these are not popular, a negatively charged electrode is rarely employed. =Electrode= The electrode is a metallic alloy wire, called a MIG wire, whose selection, alloy and size, is based primarily on the composition of the metal being welded, the process variation being used, joint design, and the material surface conditions. Electrode selection greatly influences the mechanical properties of the weld and is a key factor of weld quality. In general the finished weld metal should have mechanical properties similar to those of the base material with no defects such as discontinuities, entrained contaminants or porosity within the weld. To achieve these goals a wide variety of electrodes exist. All commercially available electrodes contain deoxidizing metals such as silicon, manganese, titanium and aluminum in small percentages to help prevent oxygen porosity. Some contain denitriding metals such as titanium and zirconium to avoid nitrogen porosity. Depending on the process variation and base material being welded the diameters of the electrodes used in GMAW typically range from 0.7 to 2.4 mm (0.028 ‚Äì 0.095 in) but can be as large as 4 mm (0.16 in). The smallest electrodes, generally up to 1.14 mm (0.045 in) are associated with the short-circuiting metal transfer process, while the most common spray-transfer process mode electrodes are usually at least 0.9 mm (0.035 in). =Shielding gas= GMAW Circuit diagram. (1) Welding torch, (2) Workpiece, (3) Power source, (4) Wire feed unit, (5) Electrode source, (6) Shielding gas supply. Shielding gases are necessary for gas metal arc welding to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld. The choice of a shielding gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affects the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, but because of the reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters. Argon is also commonly mixed with other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition of up to 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) can be helpful in welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50‚Äì75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement. Shielding gas mixtures of three or more gases are also available. Mixtures of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels. Other mixtures add a small amount of helium to argon-oxygen combinations. These mixtures are claimed to allow higher arc voltages and welding speed. Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argon--which is denser than air. It also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications. Despite being poisonous, trace amounts of nitric oxide can be used to prevent the even more troublesome ozone from being formed in the arc. The desirable rate of shielding-gas flow depends primarily on weld geometry, speed, current, the type of gas, and the metal transfer mode. Welding flat surfaces requires higher flow than welding grooved materials, since gas disperses more quickly. Faster welding speeds, in general, mean that more gas must be supplied to provide adequate coverage. Additionally, higher current requires greater flow, and generally, more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than if argon is used. Perhaps most importantly, the four primary variations of GMAW have differing shielding gas flow requirements--for the small weld pools of the short circuiting and pulsed spray modes, about 10 L/min (20 ft3/h) is generally suitable, whereas for globular transfer, around 15 L/min (30 ft3/h) is preferred. The spray transfer variation normally requires more shielding-gas flow because of its higher heat input and thus larger weld pool. Typical gas-flow amounts are approximately 20-25 L/min (40-50 ft3/h). =GMAW-based 3-D printing = GMAW has also been used as a low-cost method to 3-D print metal objects.Loose screw? 3-D printer may soon forge you a new one http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/loose-screw-3-d-printer- may-soon-forge-you-new-2D11678840You Can Now 3D Print with Metal at Home Gerald C.

For most of its applications gas metal arc welding is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than a week or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding. =Technique= GMAW's basic technique is uncomplicated, with most individuals able to achieve reasonable proficiency in a few weeks, assuming proper training and sufficient practice. As much of the process is automated, GMAW relieves the weldor (operator) of the burden of maintaining a precise arc length, as well as feeding filler metal into the weld puddle, coordinated operations that are required in other manual welding processes, such as shielded metal arc. GMAW requires only that the weldor guide the gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded, as well as periodically clean the gun's gas nozzle to remove spatter buildup. Additional skill includes knowing how to adjust the welder so the voltage, wire feed rate and gas flow rate are correct for the materials being welded and the wire size being employed. Maintaining a relatively constant contact tip-to-work distance (the stick-out distance) is important. Excessive stick-out distance may cause the wire electrode to prematurely melt, causing a sputtering arc, and may also cause the shielding gas to rapidly disperse, degrading the quality of the weld. In contrast, insufficient stick-out may increase the rate at which spatter builds up inside the gun's nozzle and in extreme cases, may cause damage to the gun's contact tip. Stick-out distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun relative to the weldment is also important. It should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the gun with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas used--with pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide. Position welding, that is, welding vertical or overhead joints, may require the use of a weaving technique to assure proper weld deposition and penetration. In position welding, gravity tends to cause molten metal to run out of the puddle, resulting in cratering and undercutting, two conditions that produce a weak weld. Weaving constantly moves the fusion zone around so as to limit the amount of metal deposited at any one point. Surface tension then assists in keeping the molten metal in the puddle until it is able to solidify. Development of position welding skill takes some experience, but is usually soon mastered. =Quality= Two of the most prevalent quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen in contact with the weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in moving air should be avoided. In GMAW the primary cause of porosity is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped is directly related to the cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base metal. =Safety= Arc welding in any form can be dangerous if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders must wear suitable protective clothing, including heavy gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to minimize exposure to the arc itself, as well as intense heat, sparks and hot metal. The intense ultraviolet radiation of the arc may cause sunburn-like damage to exposed skin, as well a condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea, or in cases of prolonged exposure, irreversible damage to the eye's retina. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to the arc. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the arc. Welders are often exposed to hazardous gases and airborne particulate matter. GMAW produces smoke containing particles of various types of oxides, and the size of the particles tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes. Smaller particles present greater danger. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Other precautions include keeping combustible materials away from the workplace, and having a working fire extinguisher nearby. Metal transfer modes The three transfer modes in GMAW are globular, short- circuiting, and spray. There are a few recognized variations of these three transfer modes including modified short-circuiting and pulsed-spray. =Globular= GMAW with globular metal transfer is considered the least desirable of the three major GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110 mm/s (250 in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up on the end of the electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool. =Short-circuiting= Further developments in welding steel with GMAW led to a variation known as short-circuit transfer (SCT) or short-arc GMAW, in which the current is lower than for the globular method. As a result of the lower current, the heat input for the short-arc variation is considerably reduced, making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and residual stress in the weld area. As in globular welding, molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode, but instead of dropping to the weld pool, they bridge the gap between the electrode and the weld pool as a result of the lower wire feed rate. This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc, but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the weld pool pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip. This process is repeated about 100 times per second, making the arc appear constant to the human eye. This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation, and allows for welding in all positions, albeit with slower deposition of weld material. Setting the weld process parameters (volts, amps and wire feed rate) within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc: generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications. Also, using short-arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials, due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool. Like the globular variation, it can only be used on ferrous metals. Cold Metal Transfer For thin materials, Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) is used by reducing the current when a short circuit is registered, producing many drops per second. CMT can be used for aluminum. =Spray= Spray transfer GMAW was the first metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, and as a result of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4 mm (0.25 in). Also, because of the large weld pool, it is often limited to flat and horizontal welding positions and sometimes also used for vertical-down welds. It is generally not practical for root pass welds. When a smaller electrode is used in conjunction with lower heat input, its versatility increases. The maximum deposition rate for spray arc GMAW is relatively high‚Äîabout 600 mm/s (1500 in/min). =Pulsed-spray= A variation of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray is based on the principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85 mm/s or 200 in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials. Comparison with flux-cored wire-fed arc welding Flux-cored, self-shielding or gasless wire-fed welding had been developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8 mm diameter, compared to 0.6 mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium. These gasless machines operate as DCEN, rather than the DCEP usually used for GMAW solid wire. DCEP, or DC Electrode Positive, makes the welding wire into the positively-charged anode, which is the hotter side of the arc. Provided that it is switchable from DCEN to DCEP, a gas-shielded wire-feed machine may also be used for flux-cored wire. Flux- cored wire is considered to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume is less likely to be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes. Flux-cored welding machines are most popular at the hobbyist level, as the machines are slightly simpler but mainly because they avoid the cost of providing shield gas, either through a rented cylinder or with the high cost of disposable cylinders.

Manchester in the United Kingdom is a city which was built by the Industrial Revolution, and has ultimately influenced political and social thinking in Britain and beyond. Historically, the city has been a hotbed for new, radical thinking, particularly during the Industrial Revolution which presented new social and political challenges for the United Kingdom. Urbanist Anna Minton describes Manchester as historically the \\"bellwether for social change in Britain\\". The city has been a centre for movements and ideals such as universal suffrage, female suffrage, the Co-operative movement, Communism, Chartism, Manchesterism and the Anti-Corn Law League. Suffrage for the lower classes was sought, with the Peterloo massacre being the prime example. Friedrich Engels, wrote The Condition of the Working Class in England based on his observations. The suffering he witnessed influenced his proposal for the idea of Communism with Karl Marx, whom he first met at Chetham's Library in Manchester city centre. The Co-operative Society was founded in Manchester in 1862. The late 19th and early 20th saw the rise of the suffragette movement, with the Pankhurst family from Manchester instrumental in this struggle for universal suffrage. Radicalism =Communism= Chetham's Library, where Engels and Marx met to discuss Manchester's suffering and to outline proposals for Communism. In 1842, 22-year-old Engels was sent by his parents to Manchester, Britain, to work for the Ermen and Engels' Victoria Mill in Weaste which made sewing threads.Salford Star issue 6 Winter 2007, read on http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=461 Engels' father thought that working at the Manchester firm might make Engels reconsider the opinions he had developed at the time. On his way to Manchester, Engels visited the office of the Rheinische Zeitung and met Karl Marx for the first time ‚Äì they were not impressed by each other.Wheen, Francis Karl Marx: A Life, p. 75 Marx mistakenly thought that Engels was still associated with the Berliner Young Hegelians, with whom he (Marx) had just broken.Heinrich Gemkow et al., Frederick Engels: A Biography (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, Germany, 1972) pp. 53‚Äì54. In Manchester Engels met Mary Burns, a fierce young working woman with radical opinions with whom he began a relationship that lasted until her death in 1862.\\"Friedrich Engels in Manchester\\", Roy Whitfield, 1988 The two never married, as both were against the institution of marriage, which Engels saw as unnatural and unjust. Burns guided Engels through Manchester and Salford, showing him the worst districts for his research. While in Manchester, Engels wrote his first economic work. This article was called \\"Outline of a Critique of Political Economy\\" and was written between October and November 1843.\\"Outline of a Critique of Political Economy\\" in contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3 (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 418‚Äì445. Engels sent the article to Paris, where Marx published it in the Deutsch-Franz√∂sische Jahrb√ºcher which Marx was now publishing in Paris. Engels also wrote a three part series of articles called \\"The Condition of England\\" in January, February and March 1844.The three part series of articles called The Condition of England is contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3 p. 444-513. While observing the slums of Manchester in close detail, Engels took notes of the horrors he observed, notably child labour, the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers.Fox Hunter, Party Animal, Leftist Warrior by Dwight Garner, The New York Times, 18 August 2009 and sent back a series of articles to Marx, first for publication in the Rheinische Zeitungand then for publication in Deutsch‚ÄìFranzosische Jahrbucher, chronicling the conditions amongst the working class in Manchester. These he would later collect and publish in his influential first book, The Condition of the Working Class in England.The Condition of the Working Class in England is contained in the Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 4 (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295‚Äì596. The book was written between September 1844 and March 1845 and was printed in German in 1845. In the book, Engels gave way to his views on the \\"grim future of capitalism and the industrial age\\", and described in detail, street after street, the total squalor in which the working people were living.Salford Star issue 6 Winter 2007, \\"Friedrich Engels in Salford\\" part 1 ‚Äì read on http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=456 The book was published in English in 1887. While writing it, Engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics. He frequented some areas also frequented by some members of the English labour and Chartist movements, whom he met, and wrote for several journals, including The Northern Star, Robert Owen's New Moral World and the Democratic Review newspaper.Whitfield, Roy (1988) The Double Life of Friedrich Engels. In: Manchester Region History Review, vol. 2, no. 1, 1988 Engel's experiences in Manchester had a profound effect on his political philosophy, he viewed capitalism as an unnecessary evil and soon wrote The Communist Manifesto. Enfranchisement =19th century= The Peterloo massacre, a 60,000‚Äì80,000 strong demonstration in August 1819 to demand parliamentary representation. In 1819, Lancashire was represented by two members of parliament (MPs). Voting was restricted to the adult male owners of freehold land valued at 40 shillings or more ‚Äì the equivalent of about ¬£80 as of 2008 ‚Äì and votes could only be cast at the county town of Lancaster, by a public spoken declaration at the hustings. Constituency boundaries were out of date, and the so-called \\"rotten boroughs\\" had a hugely disproportionate influence on the membership of the Parliament of the United Kingdom compared to the size of their populations: Old Sarum in Wiltshire, with one voter, elected two MPs,Reid (1989), p. 28. as did Dunwich in Suffolk, which by the early 19th century had almost completely disappeared into the sea. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport, with a combined population of almost one million, were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire, or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport. By comparison, more than half of all MPs were elected by a total of just 154 voters. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile manufacture was followed by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners. Weavers who could have expected to earn 15 shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5 shillings or even 4s 6d by 1818.Hernon (2006), p. 22. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large. By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions was at its peak and had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism among the cotton loom weavers of south Lancashire.Frangopulo (1977), p. 30. In response, coupled with the lack of suffrage in northern England, a \\"great assembly\\" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, formed by radicals from the Manchester Observer: founder and journalist Joseph Johnson became secretary of the union, editor James Wroe its treasurer. Johnson wrote to the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt asking him to chair a large meeting planned for Manchester on 2 August 1819. In his letter Johnson wrote: =Women's suffrage= Emmeline Pankhurst, who was born in Moss Side and led the battle for women's suffrage. The WSPU was founded at the Pankhurst family home in Manchester on 10 October 1903 by six women, including Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, who soon emerged as the group's leaders. The WSPU had split from the non-militant National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, disappointed at the lack of success its tactics of persuading politicians through meetings had found.Mary Davis, Sylvia Pankhurst (Pluto Press, 1999) The founders decided to form a women-only organisation, which would campaign for social reforms, largely in conjunction with the Independent Labour Party. They would also campaign for an extension of women's suffrage, believing that this was central to sexual equality. To illustrate their more militant stance, they adopted the slogan \\"Deeds, not words\\". By 1913, the WSPU appointed the fiercely militant feminist Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam as general secretary. Dacre Fox operated as a highly effective progandist delivering rousing speeches at the WSPU weekly meetings and writing many of Christabel Pankhurst's speeches Movements =Co-operative movement= In 1844, 28 textile workers in Rochdale, founded the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers and became the first to pay a patronage dividend, forming the basis for the modern co-operative movement.John K. Walton \\"Co-operative movement\\" The Oxford Companion to British History. Ed. John Cannon. Oxford University Press, 1997. Oxford Reference Online. Retrieved via county library service on 25 June 2008. In 1863, many co-operatives in the north amalgamated and based themselves in Manchester. Today the Co-operative exists in the form of The Co-operative Group. Trade unionism =Trades Union Congress= The first TUC meeting was not held until 1868 when the Manchester and Salford Trades Council convened the founding meeting in the Manchester Mechanics' Institute (on what is now Princess Street and was then David Street; the building is at no. 103). The fact that the TUC was formed by Northern trades councils was not coincidental. One of the issues which prompted this initiative was the perception that the London Trades Council (formed in 1860 and including, because of its location, many of the most prominent union leaders of the day) was taking a dominant role in speaking for the Trade Union Movement as a whole.

The brown thrasher is abundant throughout the eastern and central United States and southern and central Canada, and it is the only thrasher to live primarily east of the Rockies and central Texas. It is the state bird of Georgia. As a member of the genus Toxostoma, the bird is a large-sized thrasher. It has brown upper parts with a white under part with dark streaks. Because of this, it is often confused with the smaller wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), among other species. The brown thrasher is noted for having over 1000 song types, and the largest song repertoire of birds. However, each note is usually repeated in two or three phrases. The brown thrasher is an omnivore, with its diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts. The usual nesting areas are shrubs, small trees, or at times on ground level. Brown thrashers are generally inconspicuous but territorial birds, especially when defending their nests, and will attack species as large as humans.  Taxonomy and naming  The brown thrasher was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Turdus rufus. The genus name Toxostoma comes from the Ancient Greek , \\"bow\\" or \\"arch\\" and stoma, \\"mouth\\". The specific rufum is Latin for \\"red\\", but covers a wider range of hues than the English term. Although not in the thrush family, this bird is sometimes erroneously called the brown thrush. The name misconception could be because the word thrasher is believed to derive from the word thrush. The naturalist Mark Catesby called it the fox-coloured thrush. Genetic studies have found that the brown thrasher is most closely related to the long-billed and Cozumel thrashers (T. longirostre & guttatum), within the genus Toxostoma. Description The brown thrasher is bright reddish-brown above with thin, dark streaks on its buffy underparts. It has a whitish-colored chest with distinguished teardrop-shaped markings on its chest. Its long, rufous tail is rounded with paler corners, and eyes are a brilliant yellow. Its bill is brownish, long, and curves downward. Both male and females are similar in appearance. The juvenile appearance of the brown thrasher from the adult is not remarkably different, except for plumage texture, indiscreet upper part markings, and the irises having an olive color. Adult with juvenile (r) in Virginia, U.S. The brown thrasher is a fairly large passerine, although it is generally moderate in size for a thrasher, being distinctly larger than the sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus) but similar or somewhat smaller in size than the more brownish Toxostoma species found further west. Adults measure around long with a wingspan of , and weigh , with an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is and the tarsus is . There are two subspecies: the 'brown thrasher' (T. rufum rufum), which lies in the eastern half of Canada and the United States, and the 'western brown thrasher' (T. rufum longicauda (Baird, 1858)), which resides in the central United States east of the Rocky Mountains and southern central Canada. The western brown thrasher is distinguished by a more cinnamon upper part, whiter wing bars, and darker breast spots than T.rufum rufum. The lifespan of the brown thrasher depends on a year-to-year basis, as the rate of survival the first year is 35%, 50% in between the second and third year, and 75% between the third and fourth year. Disease and exposure to cold weather are among contributing factors for the limits of the lifespan. However, the longest lived thrasher in the wild is 12 years, and relatively the same for ones in captivity. =Similar species= The similar-looking long-billed thrasher has a significantly smaller range. It has a gray head and neck, and has a longer bill than the brown thrasher. The brown thrasher's appearance is also strikingly similar to the wood thrush, the bird that it is usually mistaken for. However, the wood thrush has dark spots on its under parts rather than the brown thrashers' streaks, has dark eyes, shorter tail, a shorter, straighter bill (with the head generally more typical of a thrush) and is a smaller bird. Distribution and habitat The brown thrasher resides in various habitats. It prefers to live in woodland edges, thickets and dense brush, often searching for food in dry leaves on the ground. It can also inhabit areas that are agricultural and near suburban areas, but is less likely to live near housing than other bird species. The brown thrasher often vies for habitat and potential nesting grounds with other birds, which is usually initiated by the males. The brown thrasher is a strong, but partial migrant, as the bird is a year-round resident in the southern portion of its range. The breeding range includes the United States and Canada east of the Rocky Mountains, but has been occasionally spotted West of the Rockies. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated a westward range expansion of the brown thrasherCavitt, J. F. and C. A. Haas (2014). Brown Thrasher (Toxostoma rufum). In The Birds of North America. A. F. Poole (ed.) Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. as well as range expansions of many other species of birds. Studies indicate that thrashers that reside in the New England region of the United States during the breeding season fly toward the Carolinas and Georgia, birds located in the east of the Mississippi winter from Arkansas to Georgia, and birds located in the Dakotas and the central Canadian provinces head towards eastern Texas and Louisiana. When the species does migrate, it is typically for short distances and during the night. There are also records of the bird wintering in Mexico, as well as a British record of a transatlantic vagrant. Behavior John James Audubon's picture depicting ferruginous thrush The brown thrasher has been observed either solo or in pairs. The brown thrasher is usually an elusive bird, and maintains its evasiveness with low-level flying. When it feels bothered, it usually hides into thickets and gives cackling calls. Thrashers spend most of their time on ground level or near it. When seen, it is commonly the males that are singing from unadorned branches. The brown thrasher has been noted for having an aggressive behavior, and is a staunch defender of its nest. However, the name does not come from attacking perceived threats, but is believed to have come from the thrashing sound the bird makes when digging through ground debris. It is also thought that the name comes from the thrashing sound that is made while it is smashing large insects to kill and eventually eat. =Feeding= This bird is omnivorous, which has a diet that includes insects, berries, nuts and seeds, as well as earthworms, snails, and sometimes lizards and frogs. Across seasons and its breeding range, it was found 63% of stomach contents were made of animal matter, the remaining 37% being plant material. During the breeding season, the diet consists primarily of beetles, grasshoppers, and other arthropods, and fruits, nuts and seeds. More than 80% of the diet of brown thrasher from Illinois is made of animal matter, about 50% being beetles. In Iowa, about 20% of the summer diet was found to consist of grasshoppers. By the late summer, it begins to shift towards more of a herbivore diet, focusing on fruits, nuts, seeds, and grains, 60% of the food in Illinois being fruits and seeds. By winter, the customary diet of the brown thrasher is fruit and acorns. Wintering birds in Texas were found to eat 58% plant material (mainly sugar berry and poison ivy) and 42% animal material in October; by March, in the dry period when food supply is generally lower, 80% of the food became animal and only 20% plants. Vertebrates are only eaten occasionally and are often comprised by small reptiles and amphibians, such as lizards, small or young snakes, tree frogs and salamanders.Bent, A. C. (1948). \\"Life histories of North American nuthatches, wrens, thrashers, and their allies\\". U.S. Natl. Mus. Bull. p. 195. The brown thrasher utilizes its vision while scouring for food. It usually forages for food under leaves, brushes, and soil debris on the ground using its bill. It then swipes the floor in side-to-side motions, and investigates the area it recently foraged in. The brown thrasher forages in a similar method to the long-billed thrasher and Bendire's thrasher (T. longirostre & bendirei), picking food off the ground and under leaf litter, whereas thrashers with sharply decurved bills are more likely to dig into the ground to obtain food. Foraging success is 25% greater in dry leaf litter as compared to damp leaf letter. The brown thrasher can also hammer nuts such as acorns in order to remove the shell. It has also been noted for its flexibility in catching quick insects, as the amount of vertebrae in its neck exceeds giraffes and camels. In one case, a brown thrasher was observed to dig a hole about deep, place an acorn in it and hit the acorn until it cracked, considered to be a form of tool usage. In a laboratory experiment, a brown thrasher was found to be able to discern and reject the toxic eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) and a palatable mimic of that species, the red salamander (Pseudotriton ruber), but continued to eat palatable dusky salamanders (Desmognathus spp.). =Breeding= Nest and eggs Brown thrashers are typically monogamous birds, but mate-switching does occur, at times during the same season. Their breeding season varies by region. In the southeastern United States, the breeding months begin in February and March, while May and June see the commencement of breeding in the northern portion of their breeding range. When males enter the breeding grounds, their territory can range from . Around this time of the year the males are usually at their most active, singing loudly to attract potential mates, and are found on top of perches. The courting ritual involves the exchanging of probable nesting material. Males will sing gentler as they sight a female, and this enacts the female to grab a twig or leaf and present it to the male, with flapping wings and chirping sounds. The males might also present a gift in response and approach the female. Both sexes will take part in nest building once mates find each other, and will mate after the nest is completed. The female lays 3 to 5 eggs, that usually appears with a blueish or greenish tint along with reddish-brown spots. There are rare occurrences of no spots on the eggs. The nest is built twiggy, lined with grass, leaves, and other forms of dead vegetation. The nests are typically built in a dense shrub or low in a tree, usually up to high, but have built nests as high as . They also on occasion build nests on the ground. Between eleven days to two weeks, the eggs hatch. Both parents incubate and feed the young, with the female doing most of the incubating. Nine to thirteen days after hatching, the nestlings begin to fledge. These birds raise two, sometimes even three, broods in a year. The male sings a series of short repeated melodious phrases from an open perch to declare his territory, and is also very aggressive in defending the nest, known to strike people and animals. =Vocal development= The male brown thrasher may have the largest song repertoire of any North American bird, which has been documented at least over 1,100. Some sources state that each individual has up to 3,000 song phrases, while others stated beyond 3,000. The males' singing voice usually contains more of a melodic tone than that of the related grey catbird. Its song are coherent phrases that are iterated no more than three times, but has been done for minutes at a time. By the fall, the male sings with smoother sub-songs. During the winter, the males may also sing in short spurts during altercations with neighboring males. In the birds' youth, alarm noises are the sounds made. As an adult, the brown thrasher has an array of sounds it will make in various situations. Both male and females make smack and teeooo-like alarm calls when provoked, and hijjj sounds at dusk and dawn. Others calls may consist of an acute, sudden chakk, rrrrr, a Tcheh sound in the beginning that ends with an eeeur, kakaka, and sounds reminiscent of a stick scraping a concrete sidewalk. Brown thrashers are noted for their mimicry (as a member of the family Mimidae), but they are not as diverse in this category as their relative the northern mockingbird. However, during the breeding season, the mimicking ability of the male is at its best display, impersonating sounds from tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor), northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), wood thrushes, northern flickers (Colaptes auratus), among other species. Predation and threats In High Island, Texas Although this bird is widespread and still common, it has declined in numbers in some areas due to loss of suitable habitat. Despite the decrease, the rate does not warrant a status towards vulnerable. One of the natural nuisances is the parasitic brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), but these incidents are rare. Whenever these situations occur, the brown thrashers usually discard of the cowbirds' eggs. Occasionally, the thrasher has thrown out their own eggs instead of the cowbird eggs due to similar egg size, and at least one recorded event raised a fledgling. Northern cardinals and grey catbirds are also major competitors for thrashers in terms of territorial gain. Because of the apparent lack of opportunistic behavior around species like these, thrashers are prone to be driven out of zones for territory competition. Brown thrashers have tendencies to double-brood or have failures on their first nesting attempts due to predation. Grey catbirds have been seen invading brown thrashers' nests and breaking their eggs. Other than the catbird, snakes, birds of prey, and cats are among the top predators of the thrasher. In Kansas, at least eight species of snake were identified as potentially serious sources of nest failure.Cavitt, J. F. (1998).

The brown thrasher methods of defending itself include using its bill, which can inflict significant damage to species smaller than it, along with wing-flapping and vocal expressions. State bird The brown thrasher is the state bird of Georgia. The brown thrasher also was the inspiration for the name of Atlanta's former National Hockey League team, the Atlanta Thrashers.

The book explores numerous myths from Classical Greece through to twentieth century writers, and shows their relevance to the personal existential dilemmas of today. The book is divided into four parts: \\"The function of myths,\\" \\"Myths in America,\\" \\"Myths of the Western World\\" and \\"Myths for survival.\\" The function of myths =What is a myth?= \\"Myths are narrative patterns that give significance to our existence.\\" (p 15) \\"As long as our world and society remain... empty of myths, which express beliefs and moral goals, there will be depression... and suicide.\\" (p 21) \\"In such directionless states as we find ourselves near the end of the twentieth century, it is not surprising that frantic people flock to the new cults, or resurrect the old ones, seeking answers to their anxiety and longing for relief from their guilt or depressions, longing for something to fill the vacuum of their lives.\\" (p 22) Max Muller, writing in 1873, states \\"Depend upon it, there is mythology now as there was in the time of Homer, only we do not perceive it, because we ourselves live in the very shadow of it, and because we all shrink from the full meridian light of truth.\\"Max Muller, 1873, \\"The Philosophy of Mythology\\", Introduction to the Science of Religion, London, pp 353-355 Myths are dramatic representations of the human condition. \\"Myth... is an eternal truth in contrast to an empirical truth. The latter can change with every morning newspaper, when we read of the latest discoveries in our laboratories. But the myth transcends time\\" (p 27). Oedipus is a man who cries out,\\"I must find out who I am!\\". =Our personal crises in myths= Myths contribute to our lives in at least four ways: * they give us a sense of who we are * they make possible our loyalties to communal groups * they support our moral values * they address the mysteries of creation and creativity \\"When Jean-Paul Sartre needed a modern drama to communicate to the despairing French people, while Paris was being occupied by the Germans in World War II, he chose the ancient drama of Orestes.\\" (p 40) \\"Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman presents a powerful myth for millions of Americans and for this reason is played time and again over television and on stages throughout America\\" (p 43). \\"Willy was a salesman.

Myths of the Western World =The Therapist and the Journey Into Hell= The author proposes that the relationship between Dante and Virgil, in the Divine Comedy, is analogous to the relationship between client and therapist in psychotherapy. The client's journey into self-knowledge is a journey into hell. Dante's masterpiece prefigures the process of psychotherapy. \\"A person's hell may consist of confronting the fact that his mother never loved him; or it may consist of fantasies of destroying those a person loves most, like Medea destroying her children\\" (p 155). The therapist's task is \\"to be guide, friend, and interpreter to persons on their journeys through their private hells and purgatories\\" (p 165). \\"Human beings can reach heaven only through hell.

He always avoids commitment. He escapes confronting himself by compulsive activity. Losing his delusions of self-importance throws him into despair. He sees that he is lonely. At first the increasing self-knowledge of his own emptiness leads to envy of the happiness of others. But his spitefulness eventually heals and becomes generosity. He becomes able to commit to a relationship with Solvieg, who chooses him out of her personal integrity, whereas his mother \\"clung to him out of her deprivation\\". \\"The ultimate meaning of this myth, even more true today than it was in Ibsen's day, is that all such narcissistic egocentricity leads to self-destruction.\\" (p 190) \\"The renunciation of the narcissistic self is the beginning of authentic selfhood\\" (p 192) and the capacity to love. =Briar Rose Revisited= =Faust: The Myth of Patriarchal Power= =Goethe's Faust and the Enlightenment= =Faust in the Twentieth Century= =The Devil and Creativity= Myths for survival =The Great Circle of Love= See also * Thomas Mann, 1956, Joseph and his brothers, London, Secker & Warburg.

Along with BofA Securities, the investment banking arm, both firms engage in prime brokerage and broker-dealer activities. The firm is headquartered in New York City, and once occupied the entire 34 stories of 250 Vesey Street, part of the Brookfield Place complex in Manhattan. Merrill employs over 14,000 financial advisors and manages $2.3 trillion in client assets. The company also operates Merrill Edge, an electronic trading platform. Prior to 2009, the company was publicly owned and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to be acquired by Bank of America on September 14, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the same weekend that Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. The acquisition was completed in January 2009Jan 2009 ‚Äì see Crash of the Titans by Greg Farrell and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. was merged into Bank of America Corporation in October 2013, with certain Bank of America subsidiaries continuing to carry the Merrill Lynch name, including the broker- dealer Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. In 2019, Bank of America rebranded the unit to \\"Merrill\\". Merrill Lynch rose to prominence on the strength of its network financial advisors, sometimes referred to as the \\"thundering herd\\", that allowed it to place securities it underwrote directly. In contrast, many established Wall Street firms, such as Morgan Stanley, relied on groups of independent brokers for placement of the securities they underwrote. It was once known as the \\"Catholic\\" firm of Wall Street and most of its executives were Irish Catholics. History Merrill Lynch logo before the rebranding in February 2019 =Founding and early history= The company was founded on January 6, 1914, when Charles E. Merrill opened Charles E. Merrill & Co. for business at 7 Wall Street in New York City. A few months later, Merrill's friend, Edmund C. Lynch, joined him, and in 1915 the name was officially changed to Merrill, Lynch & Co. At that time, the firm's name included a comma between Merrill and Lynch, which was dropped in 1938. In 1916, Winthrop H. Smith joined the firm. Merrill Lynch logo c. 1917 In 1921, the company purchased Path√© Exchange, which later became RKO Pictures. In 1926, the firm acquired a controlling interest in Safeway Inc., transforming the small grocery store into the country's third-largest grocery store chain by the early 1930s. In 1930, Charles E. Merrill led the firm through a major restructuring, spinning-off the company's retail brokerage business to E. A. Pierce & Co. to focus on investment banking. Along with the business, Merrill also transferred the bulk of its employees, including Edmund C. Lynch and Winthrop H. Smith. Charles Merrill received a minority interest in E.A. Pierce in the transaction. Throughout the 1930s, E.A. Pierce remained the largest brokerage in the U.S. The firm, led by Edward A. Pierce, Edmund Lynch and Winthrop Smith proved to be one of the most innovative in the industry, introducing IBM machines into the business' record keeping. Additionally, by 1938, E.A. Pierce controlled the largest wire network with a private network of over 23,000 miles of telegraph wires. These wires were typically used for orders. Despite its strong position in the market, E.A. Pierce was struggling financially in the 1930s and was thinly capitalized. Following the death of Edmund C. Lynch in 1938, Winthrop Smith began discussions with Charles E. Merrill, who owned a minority interest in E.A. Pierce about a possible merger of the two firms. On April 1, 1940, Merrill Lynch, merged with Edward A. Pierce's E. A. Pierce & Co. and Cassatt & Co., a Philadelphia-based brokerage firm in which both Merrill Lynch and E.A. Pierce held an interest. and was briefly known as Merrill Lynch, E. A. Pierce, and Cassatt. The company became the first on Wall Street to publish an annual fiscal report in 1941. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith logo in use prior to the firm's 1974 rebranding that introduced the \\"bull\\" logo In 1941, Merrill Lynch, E. A. Pierce, and Cassatt merged with Fenner & Beane, a New Orleans-based investment bank and commodities company. Throughout the 1930s, Fenner & Beane was consistently the second largest securities firm in the U.S. The combined firm, which became the clear leader in securities brokerage in the U.S., was renamed Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Beane. =Post-war years= In 1952, the company formed Merrill Lynch & Co. as a holding company and officially incorporated after nearly half a century as a partnership. On December 31, 1957, The New York Times referred to that name as \\"a sonorous bit of Americana\\" and said, \\"After sixteen years of popularizing [it], Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, and Beane is going to change it‚Äîand thereby honor the man who has been largely responsible for making the name of a brokerage house part of an American saga,\\" Winthrop H. Smith, who had been running the company since 1940. The merger made the company the largest securities firm in the world, with offices in more than 98 cities and membership on 28 exchanges. At the start of the firm's fiscal year on March 1, 1958, the firm's name became \\"Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith\\" and the company became a member of the New York Stock Exchange.\\"Revising a Sonorous Piece of Americana: Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith.\\" The New York Times, December 31, 1957, p. 29 In 1964, Merrill Lynch acquired C. J. Devine & Co., the leading dealer in U.S. Government Securities. The merger came together due to the death of Christopher J. Devine in May 1963. The C. J. Devine & Co. partners, referred to as \\"The Devine Boys\\", formed Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc., giving the firm a strong presence in the government securities market. The Government Securities business brought Merrill Lynch the needed leverage to establish many of the unique money market products and government bond mutual fund products, responsible for much of the firm's growth in the 1970s and 1980s.\\"Wall Street: A Sweet Deal,\\" Time magazine, May 22, 1964 In June 1971, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, a year after the New York Stock Exchange allowed member firms to become publicly- owned. It was a multinational corporation with over US$1.8 trillion in client assets, operating in more than 40 countries around the world. In 1977, the company introduced its Cash management account (CMA), which enabled customers to sweep all their cash into a money market fund, and included check-writing capabilities and a credit card. In 1978, it significantly buttressed its securities underwriting business by acquiring White Weld & Co., a small but prestigious old-line investment bank. =Canadian operations in the 1990s= In 1990, the company sold its Canadian private client operations to CIBC Wood Gundy. In June 1998, Merrill Lynch re-entered the Canadian investment business with its purchase of Midland Walwyn Inc. At the time, Canada was the seventh- largest market for personal investment. In December 2001, Merrill Lynch sold Midland Walwyn to CIBC Wood Gundy. =Investment in TMS Entertainment (2003)= In 2003, Merrill Lynch became the second-largest shareholder of Japanese animation studio TMS Entertainment. In a report to the Finance Ministry, the Merrill Lynch group said it had acquired a 7.54% stake in TMS by purchasing 3.33 million shares. Merrill Lynch purchased the stake purely for investment purposes and had no intention of acquiring control of the firm's management. =Subprime mortgage crisis= In November 2007, Merrill Lynch announced it would write-down $8.4 billion in losses associated with the subprime mortgage crisis, and terminated E. Stanley O'Neal as its chief executive. O'Neal had earlier approached Wachovia for a merger, without prior Board approval, but the talks ended after O'Neal's dismissal. Merrill Lynch named John Thain as its new CEO that month. In his first days at work in December 2007, Thain made changes in Merrill Lynch's top management, announcing that he would bring in former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) colleagues such as Nelson Chai as CFO and Margaret D. Tutwiler as head of communications. Later that month, the firm announced it would sell its commercial finance business to General Electric, and would sell shares of its stock to Temasek Holdings, a Singapore government investment group, in an effort to raise capital. The deal raised more than $6 billion. In July 2008, Thain announced $4.9 billion fourth-quarter losses for the company from defaults and bad investments in the ongoing mortgage crisis. In one year between July 2007 and July 2008, Merrill Lynch lost $19.2 billion, or $52 million, daily. The company's stock price had also declined significantly during that time. Two weeks later, the company announced the sale of select hedge funds and securities in an effort to reduce their exposure to mortgage- related investments. Temasek Holdings agreed to purchase the funds and increase its investment in the company by $3.4 billion. Then-New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo threatened to sue Merrill Lynch in August 2008 over its misrepresentation of the risk on mortgage-backed securities. A week earlier, Merrill Lynch had offered to buy back $12 billion in auction-rate debt and said it was surprised by the lawsuit. Three days later, the company froze hiring and revealed that it had charged almost $30 billion in losses to its subsidiary in the United Kingdom, exempting them from taxes in that country. On August 22, 2008, CEO John Thain announced an agreement with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth to buy back all auction-rate securities from customers with less than $100 million in deposit with the firm, beginning in October 2008 and expanding in January 2009. On September 5, 2008 Goldman Sachs downgraded Merrill Lynch's stock to \\"conviction sell\\" and warned of further losses at the company. Bloomberg reported in September 2008 that Merrill Lynch had lost $51.8 billion on mortgage-backed securities as part of the subprime mortgage crisis. CDO losses Merrill Lynch, like many other banks, became heavily involved in the mortgage-based collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market in the early 2000s. According to an article in Credit magazine, Merrill's rise to be the leader of the CDO market began in 2003 when Christopher Ricciardi brought his CDO team from Credit Suisse First Boston to Merrill. To provide a ready supply of mortgages for the CDOs, Merrill purchased First Franklin Financial Corp., one of the largest subprime lenders in the country, in December 2006. Between 2006 and 2007, Merrill was \\"lead underwriter\\" on 136 CDOs worth $93 billion. By the end of 2007, the value of these CDOs was collapsing, but Merrill had held onto portions of them, creating billions of dollars in losses for the company. In mid-2008, Merrill sold a group of CDOs that had once been valued at $30.6 billion to Lone Star Funds for $1.7 billion in cash and a $5.1 billion loan. In April 2009, bond insurance company MBIA sued Merrill Lynch for fraud and five other violations. These were related to the credit default swap \\"insurance\\" contracts Merrill had bought from MBIA on four of Merrill's mortgage-based collateralized debt obligations. These were the \\"ML-Series\\" CDOs, Broderick CDO 2, Highridge ABS CDO I, Broderick CDO 3, and Newbury Street CDO. MBIA claimed, among other things, that Merrill defrauded MBIA about the quality of these CDOs, and that it was using the complicated nature of these particular CDOs (CDOs squared and cubed) to hide the problems it knew about in the securities that the CDOs were based on. However, in 2010 Justice Bernard Fried disallowed all but one of the charges: the claim by MBIA that Merrill had committed breach of contract by promising the CDOs were worthy of an AAA rating when, it alleges, in reality, they weren't. When the CDOs lost value, MBIA wound up owing Merrill a large amount of money. Merrill disputed MBIA's claims. In 2009, Rabobank sued Merrill over a CDO named Norma. Rabobank later claimed that its case against Merrill was very similar to the SEC's fraud charges against Goldman Sachs and its Abacaus CDOs. Rabobank alleged that a hedge fund named Magnetar Capital had chosen assets to go into Norma, and allegedly bet against them, but that Merrill had not informed Rabobank of this fact. Instead, Rabobank alleges that Merrill told it that NIR Group was selecting the assets. When the CDO value tanked, Rabobank was left owing Merrill a large amount of money. Merrill disputed the arguments of Rabobank, with a spokesman claiming \\"The two matters are unrelated and the claims today are not only unfounded but weren't included in the Rabobank lawsuit filed nearly a year ago\\". =Sale to Bank of America= Significant losses were attributed to the drop in value of its large and unhedged mortgage portfolio in the form of collateralized debt obligations. Trading partners' loss of confidence in Merrill Lynch's solvency and ability to refinance money market obligations ultimately led to its sale. During the week of September 8, 2008, Lehman Brothers came under severe liquidity pressures, with its survival in question. If Lehman Brothers failed, investors were afraid that the contagion could spread to the other surviving investment banks. On Sunday, September 14, 2008, Bank of America announced it was in talks to purchase Merrill Lynch for $38.25 billion in stock. Later that day, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America for 0.8595 shares of Bank of America common stock for each Merrill Lynch common share, or about US$50 billion or $29 per share. This price represented a 70.1% premium over the September 12 closing price or a 38% premium over Merrill's book value of $21 a share, but a discount of 61% from its September 2007 price. Congressional testimony by Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis, as well as internal emails released by the House Oversight Committee, indicated that the merger was transacted under pressure from federal officials, who said that they would otherwise seek the replacement of Bank of America's management as a condition of any government assistance. In March 2009, it was reported that in 2008, Merrill Lynch received billions of dollars from its insurance arrangements with AIG, including $6.8 billion from funds provided by the United States government to bail out AIG. =Post-merger with Bank of America= After merging Merrill Lynch into its businesses, Bank of America continued to operate Merrill Lynch for its wealth management services and integrated Merrill Lynch's investment bank into the newly formed BofA Securities. =Launch of Merrill Edge= On June 21, 2010, the company launched Merrill Edge, an electronic trading platform. =Rebranding= In February 2019, Bank of America announced the division was to be rebranded from \\"Merrill Lynch\\" to \\"Merrill\\". Regulatory actions =Orange County settlement= In 1998, Merrill Lynch paid Orange County, California $400 million to settle accusations that it sold inappropriate and risky investments to former county treasurer Robert Citron. Citron lost $1.69 billion, which forced the county to file for bankruptcy in December 1994. The county sued a dozen or more securities companies, advisors and accountants, but Merrill settled without admitting liability, paying $400 million of a total $600 million recovered by the county. =Analyst Research settlement= In 2002, Merrill Lynch settled for a fine of $100 million for publishing misleading research. As part of the agreement with the New York attorney general and other state securities regulators, Merrill Lynch agreed to increase research disclosure and work to decouple research from investment banking. Misleading of investors by Henry Blodget Between 1999 and 2001, during the dot-com bubble, Henry Blodget, a well-known analyst at Merrill Lynch, gave assessments about stocks in private emails that conflicted with what he publicly published via Merrill. In 2003, he was charged with civil securities fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He settled without admitting or denying the allegations and was subsequently barred from the securities industry for life. He paid a $2 million fine and $2 million disgorgement. =Enron/Merrill Lynch Nigerian barge= In 2004, convictions of Merrill executives marked the only instance in the Enron investigation where the government criminally charged any officials from the banks and securities firms that allegedly helped Enron execute its accounting scandals. The case revolved around a 1999 transaction involving Merrill, Enron and the sale of some electricity-producing barges off the coast of Nigeria. The charges alleged that the 1999 sale of an interest in Nigerian power barge by an Enron entity to Merrill Lynch was a sham that allowed Enron to illegally book about $12 million in pretax profit, when in fact there was no real sale and no real profit. Four former Merrill top executives and two former midlevel Enron officials faced conspiracy and fraud charges. Merrill cut its own deal, firing bankers and agreeing to the outside oversight of its structured-finance transactions. It also settled civil fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, without admitting or denying fault. =Discrimination charges= On June 26, 2007, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) brought suit against Merrill Lynch,Associated, The. (June 27, 2007) alleging the firm discriminated against Dr. Majid Borumand because of his Iranian nationality and Islamic religion, with \\"reckless disregard\\" for his protected civil rights. The EEOC lawsuit maintained that violations by the company were intentional and committed with malice. In another case concerning mistreatment of another Iranian employee by Merrill Lynch, on July 20, 2007, a National Association of Securities Dealers arbitration panel ordered the company to pay Fariborz Zojaji, a former Iranian employee, $1.6 million for being fired due to his Persian ethnicity. Merrill Lynch was criticized by both the National Iranian American Council, and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. On August 13, 2008, a New Jersey appeals court rendered a ruling against Merrill Lynch in a lawsuit filed by Darren Kwiatkowski, a gay employee who was called a ‚Äústupid fag‚Äù by another employee. In August 2013, the company agreed to pay $160 million to settle a class action racism lawsuit brought by a longtime U.S. employee in 2005. At the time the lawsuit was filed, 2% of the brokers at the company were black, despite a 30-year-old consent decree it had signed with the EEOC that required the company to increase its proportion of black brokers to 6.5%, and despite the fact that in 25 states, the company did not have a single black broker. The funds were available to all black brokers and trainees at the firm since May 2001, estimated to be 700‚Äì1,200 people. During the case, Merrill's black CEO, Stanley O'Neal, said that black brokers may have a harder time getting business for the company since most of its clients were white. =Market timing settlement= In March 2005, Merrill Lynch paid a $10 million civil penalty to settle allegations of improper activities at the firm's Fort Lee, New Jersey office. Three financial advisors, and a fourth who was involved to a lesser degree, placed 12,457 trades for Millennium Partners, a client, in at least 521 mutual funds and 63 mutual fund sub-accounts of at least 40 variable annuities. Millennium made profits in over half of the funds and fund sub- accounts. In those funds where Millennium made profits, its gains totalled about $60 million. Merrill Lynch failed to reasonably supervise these financial advisers, whose market timing siphoned short-term profits out of mutual funds and harmed long-term investors. =2008 bonus payments= In 2008, Merrill Lynch arranged for payment $3.6 billion in bonuses, one-third of the money received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, for performance that year in what appeared to be \\"special timing,\\" despite reported losses of $27 billion the same year. =Charges for misleading customers about trading venues= On 19 June 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Merrill Lynch of misleading brokerage customers about trading venues between 2008 and 2013. Merrill Lynch admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay a $42 million penalty. =Improper handling of ADRs= On 22 March 2019, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay more than $8 million to settle charges of improper handling of \\"pre-released\\" American depositary receipts under investigation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Merrill Lynch didn't admit or deny the investigation findings but agreed to pay disgorgement of more than $4.4 million in ill-gotten gains plus $724,000 in prejudgment interest and an additional penalty of $2.89 million.

Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti- ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. The Rafale is referred to as an \\"omnirole\\" aircraft by Dassault. In the late 1970s, the French Air Force and French Navy were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft. In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales, France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development programme. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight- test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France's major defence contractors, such as Dassault, Thales and Safran. Many of the aircraft's avionics and features, such as direct voice input, the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the optronique secteur frontal infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft is available in three main variants: Rafale C single- seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version. Introduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export to several countries, and was selected for purchase by the Indian Air Force, the Egyptian Air Force, the Qatar Air Force and the Hellenic Air Force. The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria. Development =Origins= In the mid-1970s, both the French Air Force (Arm√©e de l'Air) and Navy (Marine Nationale) had requirements for a new generation of fighters to replace those in or about to enter service.Williams 2002, p. 92. Because their requirements were similar, and to reduce cost, both departments issued a common request for proposal. In 1975, the French Ministry of Aviation initiated studies for a new aircraft to complement the upcoming and smaller Dassault Mirage 2000, with each aircraft optimised for differing roles. In 1979, the French company Dassault joined the MBB/BAe \\"European Collaborative Fighter\\" (ECA) project which was renamed the \\"European Combat Aircraft\\".Buttler 2000, p. 134. The French company contributed the aerodynamic layout of a prospective twin- engine, single-seat fighter; however, the project collapsed in 1981 due to differing operational requirements of each partner country. In 1983, the \\"Future European Fighter Aircraft\\" (FEFA) programme was initiated, bringing together Italy, Spain, West Germany, France and the United Kingdom to jointly develop a new fighter, although the latter three had their own aircraft developments.Eden et al. 2004, p. 168. A number of factors led to the eventual split between France and the other four countries. Around 1984 France reiterated its requirement for a carrier-capable version and demanded a leading role. It also insisted on a swing-role fighter that was lighter than the design favoured by the other four nations. West Germany, the UK and Italy opted out and established a new EFA programme. In Turin on 2 August 1985, West Germany, the UK and Italy agreed to go ahead with the Eurofighter, and confirmed that France, along with Spain, had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project. Despite pressure from France, Spain rejoined the Eurofighter project in early September 1985. The four-nation project eventually resulted in the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon.\\"Eurofighter: Spain joins the club.\\" The Economist, 17 September 1985, p. 68. =Design phase and prototype= In France, the government proceeded with its own programme. The French Ministry of Defence required an aircraft capable of air-to-air and air- to-ground, all-day and adverse weather operations. Unlike other contemporary European fighter projects that required some level of international collaboration and cost-sharing, France was the sole developer of the Rafale's airframe, avionics, propulsion system and armament, and as such the aircraft was to replace a multitude of aircraft in the French Armed Forces. The Rafale would perform roles previously filled by an assortment of specialised platforms, including the Jaguar, Mirage F1C/CR/CT, Mirage 2000C/-5/N in the Arm√©e de l'air, and the F-8P Crusader, √âtendard IVP/M and Super √âtendard in the A√©ronavale. During October‚ÄìDecember 1978, prior to France's joining of the ECA, Dassault received contracts for the development of project ACT 92 (Avion de Combat Tactique, meaning \\"Tactical Combat Airplane\\"). The following year, the National Office for Aviation Studies and Research began studying the possible configurations of the new fighter under the codename Rapace (meaning \\"Bird of Prey\\"). By March 1980, the number of configurations had been narrowed down to four, two of which had a combination of canards, delta wings and a single vertical tail-fin. In October 1982, the French Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault would build a technology demonstrator named Avion de Combat exp√©rimental (Experimental Combat Airplane, ACX). France wanted to collaborate with West Germany and the UK on the project, but was prepared to build the ACX by itself. In 1984, the government decided to proceed with a combat variant of the ACX due to the conflicting technical criteria of the respective FEFA participant nations.Flight International January 1983, p. 445. alt=Side view of white jet aircraft parked with other aircraft in the background The resultant Rafale A technology demonstrator was a large-delta winged fighter, with all-moving canards, embodying fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system. Construction of the demonstrator commenced in March 1984, even before a contract was signed with the DGA, France's defence procurement agency. The technology demonstrator was rolled out in December 1985 in Saint- Cloud, and took its maiden flight on 4 July 1986 from Istres-Le Tub√© Air Base in southern France. During the one-hour flight, the project's chief test pilot Guy Mitaux-Maurouard took the aircraft to an altitude of and a speed of Mach 1.3. The demonstrator stopped in upon landing.Sedbon July 1986, p. 4. Throughout the flight test programme, the Rafale A performed numerous day and night take-offs and landings aboard the carriers and to investigate the pilot's field of view during carrier operations. It reached a speed of and a height of . The demonstrator was initially powered by General Electric F404-GE-400 afterburning turbofans from the F/A-18 Hornet, instead of the Snecma M88, to reduce the risk that often comes with a first flight, and since the M88 was not considered sufficiently mature for the initial trials programme.Spick 2000, p. 433. It was not until May 1990 when the M88 replaced the port F404 in the demonstrator to enable the aircraft to reach Mach 1.4 and demonstrate supercruise, or sustained supersonic flight without use of afterburners. After 865 flights with four pilots, Rafale A was retired in January 1994.Norris and Sedbon 1991, p. 35. At the time of the Rafale A's maiden flight, France entered unsuccessful talks with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway about a possible collaboration on the Rafale as a multinational project; at the time, Belgium was reportedly interested in the Rafale B. In June 1987, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac declared that the country would proceed with the US$30 billion project. Subsequently, on 21 April 1988, the French government awarded Dassault a contract for four Rafale prototypes: one Rafale C, two Rafale Ms and one Rafale B. The first out of an expected 330 Rafales was scheduled to enter service in 1996.Sedbon and De Wulf 1986, p. 9.Sedbon January 1986, p. 11.Flight International 1991, p. 34. However, the fall of the Berlin Wall, which signalled the end of the Cold War, as well as the need to reduce the national deficit, compelled the French government to drastically reduce its defence budget; the 1994 budget for the Rafale programme was cut by US$340 million.Moxon 1995, p. 5.Barrie 1993, p. 26. This reduced the size of the Rafale orders, which Dassault and other companies involved claimed impeded production management and led to higher costs, and delayed the entry of the aircraft into service. The French Air Force was reorganised, the Mirage 5F was completely phased out and a total of 55 Mirage F1Cs were upgraded to a tactical fighter configuration, redesignated as Mirage F1CT. The budget cuts prolonged the Rafale's development considerably.Sedbon June 1989, p. 42.Flight International 1994, p. 27. Rafale logo During the Rafale A flight test programme, the French government in 1989 looked at the F/A-18 Hornet as a potential replacement for the rapidly aging F-8 Crusader, which had been serving since the 1950s. The French Navy entered purchase of second-hand F/A-18s with Australia, Canada and the US, after the decision was made not to upgrade the Crusaders. The US Navy agreed to supply two F/A-18s to the French Navy for \\"interoperability testing\\" aboard the French aircraft carrier Foch. The French government did not proceed with a purchase of the twin-engine fighter.Sedbon October 1989, p. 6. =Testing= A two-seater Rafale B during aerial refueling To meet the various roles expected of the new aircraft, the Air Force required two variants: the single-seat \\"Rafale C\\" (chasseur, meaning \\"fighter\\" or literally \\"hunter\\") and the \\"Rafale B\\" (biplace, or two-seater). The prototype of the C model (designated C01) completed its first flight on 19 May 1991, signalling the start of a test programme which primarily aimed to test the M88-2 engines, man-machine interface and weapons, and expand the flight envelope.Eden et al. 2004, p. 169. Due to budget constraints, the second single-seat prototype was never built.Williams 2002, pp. 92‚Äì93. The C01 differed significantly from the Rafale A. Although superficially identical to the technology demonstrator, it was smaller and more stealthy due to the gold-coated canopy, a re-design of the fuselage-fin joint, and the addition of radar-absorbent materials (RAM). This aircraft also saw extensive application of composite and other materials, which both reduced the radar cross-section (RCS) and weight. Moreover, Dassault opted to reject variable engine inlets and a dedicated air brake, which lessens maintenance loads and saves weight.Williams 2002, p. 93. The B01, the only prototype of the two-seat B variant, made its maiden flight on 30 April 1993. It was heavier than the single-seater, but carried less fuel. The aircraft was used for weapon-systems testing. Later it was tasked with validating weapon separation and, specifically, the carriage of heavy loads. The aircraft's typical loadout consisted of two external tanks, two Apache/Scalp cruise missiles, in addition to four air-to-air missiles.Williams 2002, p. 94. A French Navy Rafale M with tail hook deployed during landing aboard The Navy, meanwhile, sought a carrier-based aircraft to supersede its fleet of ageing √âtendard IV Ms & Ps, F-8P Crusaders and Super √âtendard Modernis√©s. While the Navy initially modernised the Crusaders, in the long- term, the requirement was met with the navalised Rafale M. The M01, the naval prototype, first flew on 12 December 1991, followed by the second on 8 November 1993. Since France had no land-based catapult test facility, catapult trials were initially carried out between during July‚ÄìAugust 1992 and early the following year, at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey. The aircraft then carried out trials aboard the carrier Foch in April 1993. Flown by Dassault's chief test pilot, Yves Kerherv√©, M02 made its maiden flight in November that year, while the first prototype completed the third round of testing at Lakehurst in November and December 1993. =Production and upgrades= Initially, the Rafale B was to be just a trainer, but the Gulf War showed that a second crew member was invaluable on strike and reconnaissance missions. Therefore, in 1991 the Air Force switched its preferences towards the two-seater, announcing that the variant would constitute 60 percent of the Rafale fleet.Eden et al. 2004, p. 170. The service originally envisaged taking delivery of 250 Rafales, but this was initially revised downwards to 234 aircraft, made up of 95 \\"A\\" and 139 \\"B\\" models\\",Williams 2002, p. 108. and later to 212 aircraft. The Navy, meanwhile, had 60 Rafales on order, down from 86 due to budget cuts. Of the 60, 25 would be M single-seaters and 35 two-seat Ns, though the two-seater was later cancelled. Production of the first aircraft series formally started in December 1992, but was suspended in November 1995 due to political and economic uncertainty. Production only resumed in January 1997 after the Ministry of Defence and Dassault agreed on a 48-aircraft (28 firm and 20 options) production run with delivery between 2002 and 2007. A further order of 59 F3 Rafales was announced in December 2004. In November 2009 the French government ordered an additional 60 aircraft to take the total order for the French Air Force and Navy to 180. During the Rafale's design phase, Dassault took advantage of Dassault Syst√®mes' CATIA (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application), a three-dimensional computer-aided design, manufacture and engineering software suite that would become standard across the industry. CATIA enabled digitisation and efficiency improvements throughout the Rafale programme, as it implemented recently developed processes such as digital mockup and product data management. It consisted of 15 GB databases of each of the Rafale's components, assisting with various aspects of the design, manufacture and through-life support. The Rafale final assembly site is located adjacent to Bordeaux‚ÄìM√©rignac Airport According to the French magazine L'Usine nouvelle, apart from several non-sensitive components sourced from the United States, the Rafale is manufactured almost entirely in France. Different elements are produced in numerous factories across the country, and final assembly takes place near Bordeaux‚ÄìM√©rignac Airport. For example, the flight control surfaces are fabricated in Haute- Savoie, the wings and avionics in Gironde, the centre fuselage in Val-d'Oise, and the engines in Essonne. Roughly 50 percent of the Rafale is produced by Dassault and the other half divided between two major partners, Thales and Safran, who rely on a network of 500 subcontractors. Altogether, the programme employs 7,000 workers. , the fabrication process of each fighter took 24 months, with an annual production rate of eleven aircraft. Deliveries of the Rafale's naval version were a high priority to replace the Navy's considerably aged F-8 Crusaders, and so the first production model for the French Navy undertook its first flight on 7 July 1999. Their first naval deployment was in 2002 on board Charles de Gaulle; by March 2002, the aircraft carrier was stationed in the Gulf of Oman, where its complement of Rafales undertook training operations.MacKenzie 2002, p. 36. In December 2004, the Air Force received its first three F2 standard Rafale Bs at the Centre d'Exp√©riences A√©riennes Militaires (CEAM, i.e. the Military Air Experiment Centre) at Mont- de-Marsan, where they were tasked to undertake operational evaluation and pilot conversion training. The total programme cost, as of FY2013, was around ‚Ç¨45.9 billion, which translated to a unit programme cost of approximately ‚Ç¨160.5 million. This figure takes in account improved hardware of the F3 standard, and which includes development costs over a period of 40 years, including inflation. The unit flyaway price as of 2010 was ‚Ç¨101.1 million for the F3+ version. In 2008, French officials were reportedly considering equipping the Rafale to launch miniaturised satellites. In 2011, upgrades under consideration included a software radio and satellite link, a new laser- targeting pod, smaller bombs and enhancements to the aircraft's data-fusion capacity. In July 2012, fleetwide upgrades of the Rafale's battlefield communications and interoperability capabilities commenced. In January 2014, Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that ‚Ç¨1 billion is allocated towards the development of the F3R standard. The standard will see the integration of the Meteor BVR missile, among other weapons and software updates. The standard was to be validated by 2018. The Rafale is planned to be the French Air Force's primary combat aircraft until 2040 or later, until replacement by the Franco-German New Generation Fighter. =Future replacement= In 2018, Dassault announced the successor to the Rafale as the New Generation Fighter. This fighter aircraft under development by Dassault Aviation and Airbus Defence and Space, is to replace France's Rafale, Germany's Eurofighter Typhoon, and Spain's F/A-18 Hornet in the 2035-40 timeframe. Design =Overview= The Rafale was developed as a modern jet fighter with a very high level of agility; Dassault chose to combine a delta wing with active close-coupled canard to maximize manoeuvrability. The aircraft is capable of withstanding from ‚àí3.6g to 9g (10.5g on Rafale solo display and a maximum of 11g can be reached in case of emergency). The Rafale is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft and uses digital fly-by-wire flight controls to artificially enforce and maintain stability. The aircraft's canards also act to reduce the minimum landing speed to ; while in flight, airspeeds as low as have been observed during training missions. According to simulations by Dassault, the Rafale has sufficient low speed performance to operate from STOBAR-configured aircraft carriers, and can take off using a ski-jump with no modifications. The Rafale M features a greatly reinforced undercarriage to cope with the additional stresses of naval landings, an arrestor hook, and \\"jump strut\\" nosewheel, which only extends during short takeoffs, including catapult launches. It also features a built-in ladder, carrier-based microwave landing system, and the new fin-tip Telemir system for syncing the inertial navigation system to external equipment. Altogether, the naval modifications of the Rafale M increase its weight by compared to other variants.Williams 2002, p. 95. The Rafale M retains about 95 percent commonality with Air Force variants including,Forsberg 1994, p. 213. although unusual for carrier-based aircraft, being unable to fold its multi-spar wings to reduce storage space. The size constraints were offset by the introduction of , France's first nuclear-powered carrier, which was considerably larger than previous carriers, Foch and Clemenceau. =Radar signature= S-duct air intake conceals jet engine blades from radar waves, and serrated patterns reduce frontal RCS Although not a full-aspect stealth aircraft, the cost of which was viewed as unacceptably excessive, the Rafale was designed for a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) and infrared signature .Richardson 2001, pp. 114‚Äì115.Forsberg 1994, p. 215. In order to reduce the RCS, changes from the initial technology demonstrator include a reduction in the size of the tail- fin, fuselage reshaping, repositioning of the engine air inlets underneath the aircraft's wing, and the extensive use of composite materials and serrated patterns for the construction of the trailing edges of the wings and canards. Seventy percent of the Rafale's surface area is composite. Many of the features designed to reduce the Rafale's visibility to threats remain classified. =Cockpit= The Rafale's glass cockpit was designed around the principle of data fusion‚Äîa central computer selects and prioritises information to display to pilots for simpler command and control. The primary flight controls are arranged in a hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS)-compatible configuration, with a right-handed side-stick controller and a left-handed throttle. The seat is inclined rearwards at an angle of 29¬∞ to improve g-force tolerance during manoeuvring and to provide a less restricted external pilot view.Jarrett 2005, p. 56. An intelligent flight suit worn by the pilot is automatically controlled by the aircraft to counteract in response to calculated g-forces.New Scientist 1986, p. 33. Forward section of Rafale on display at the Paris Air Show, 2005 Great emphasis has been placed on pilot workload minimisation across all operations. Among the features of the highly digitised cockpit is an integrated direct voice input (DVI) system, allowing a range of aircraft functions to be controlled by spoken voice commands, simplifying the pilot's access to many of the controls. Developed by Crouzet, the DVI is capable of managing radio communications and countermeasures systems, the selection of armament and radar modes, and controlling navigational functions.Sedbon 1988, p. 31. For safety reasons, DVI is deliberately not employed for safety-critical elements of the aircraft's operation, such as the final release of weapons.Jarrett 2005, pp. 270‚Äì71. For displaying information gathered from a range of sensors across the aircraft, the cockpit features a wide-angle holographic head-up display (HUD) system, two head-down flat-panel colour multi-function displays (MFDs) as well as a central collimated display. These displays have been strategically placed to minimise pilot distraction from the external environment.Jarrett 2005, pp. 144‚Äì45. Some displays feature a touch interface for ease of human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI). A head-mounted display (HMD) remains to be integrated to take full advantage of its MICA missiles. The cockpit is fully compatible with night vision goggles (NVG). In the area of life support, the Rafale is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mark 16F \\"zero-zero\\" ejection seat, capable of operation at zero speed and zero altitude. An on-board oxygen generating system, developed by Air Liquide, eliminates the need to carry bulky oxygen canisters. The Rafale's flight computer has been programmed to counteract pilot disorientation and to employ automatic recovery of the aircraft during negative flight conditions. The auto-pilot and autothrottle controls are also integrated, and are activated by switches located on the primary flight controls. =Avionics and equipment= The Rafale core avionics systems employ an integrated modular avionics (IMA), called MDPU (modular data processing unit). This architecture hosts all the main aircraft functions such as the flight management system, data fusion, fire control, and the man-machine interface. The total value of the radar, electronic communications and self- protection equipment is about 30 percent of the cost of the entire aircraft. The IMA has since been installed upon several upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters, and incorporated into the civilian airliner, the Airbus A380. According to Dassault, the IMA greatly assists combat operations via data fusion, the continuous integration and analysis of the various sensor systems throughout the aircraft, and has been designed for the incorporation of new systems and avionics throughout the Rafale's service life. SPECTRA's elements The Rafale features an integrated defensive-aids system named SPECTRA, which protects the aircraft against airborne and ground threats, developed as a joint venture between Thales and MBDA. Various methods of detection, jamming, and decoying have been incorporated, and the system has been designed to be highly reprogrammable for addressing new threats and incorporating additional sub- systems in the future.Chaltiel, Pierre-Yves; Trouche, Jean-Marie; Bernard- Guelle, Christian. SPECTRA ‚Äì Protection and avoidance system for the Rafale fighter aircraft fire control, \\"Nouvelle Revue d'Aeronautique et d'Astronautique.\\" January‚ÄìFebruary 1997. pp. 23‚Äì33. Operations over Libya were greatly assisted by SPECTRA, allowing Rafales to perform missions independently from the support of dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) platforms. The Rafale's ground attack capability is heavily reliant upon sensory targeting pods, such as Thales Optronics's Reco New Generation/Areos reconnaissance pod and Damocles electro-optical/laser designation pod. Together, these systems provide targeting information, enable tactical reconnaissance missions, and are integrated with the Rafale's IMA architecture to provide analysed data feeds to friendly units and ground stations, as well as to the pilot. Damocles provides targeting information to the various armaments carried by the Rafale and is directly integrated with the Rafale's VHF/UHF secure radio to communicate target information with other aircraft. It also performs other key functions such as aerial optical surveillance and is integrated with the navigation system as a FLIR. The Damocles designation pod was described as \\"lacking competitiveness\\" when compared to rivals such as the Sniper and LITENING pods; so work began on an upgraded pod, designated Damocles XF, with additional sensors and added ability to transmit live video feeds. A new Thales targeting pod, the Talios, was officially unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show and is expected to be integrated on the Rafale by 2018. Thales' Areos reconnaissance pod is an all- weather, night-and-day-capable reconnaissance system employed on the Rafale, and provides a significantly improved reconnaissance capability over preceding platforms. Areos has been designed to perform reconnaissance under various mission profiles and condition, using multiple day/night sensors and its own independent communications datalinks. =Radar and sensors= The Rafale was first outfitted with the Thales RBE2 passive electronically scanned multi-mode radar. Thales claims to have achieved increased levels of situational awareness as compared to earlier aircraft through the earlier detection and tracking of multiple air targets for close combat and long-range interception, as well as real-time generation of three-dimensional maps for terrain- following and the real-time generation of high resolution ground maps for navigation and targeting. In early 1994, it was reported that technical difficulties with the radar had delayed the Rafale's development by six months. In September 2006, Flight International reported the Rafale's unit cost had significantly increased due to additional development work to improve the RBE2's detection range. OSF is visible above the nose cone, below the windscreen and to the side of the refueling probe The RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar now replaces the previous passively scanned RBE2. The RBE2 AA is reported to deliver a greater detection range of 200 km, improved reliability and reduced maintenance demands over the preceding radar. A Rafale demonstrator began test flights in 2002 and has totaled 100 flight hours as of December 2011. By December 2009, production of the pre-series RBE2 AA radars was underway. In early October 2012, the first Rafale equipped with an RBE2 AA radar arrived at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base for operational service (the development was described by Thales and Dassault as \\"on time and on budget\\"). By early 2014, the first Air Force front-line squadron were supposed to receive Rafales equipped with the AESA radar, following the French Navy which was slated to receive AESA-equipped Rafales starting in 2013. To enable the Rafale to perform in the air supremacy role, it includes several passive sensor systems. The front-sector electro-optical system or Optronique Secteur Frontal (OSF), developed by Thales, is completely integrated within the aircraft and can operate both in the visible and infrared wavelengths. The OSF enables the deployment of infrared missiles such as the MICA at beyond visual range distances; it can also be used for detecting and identifying airborne targets, as well as those on the ground and at sea. Dassault describes the OSF as being immune to jamming and capable of providing covert long-range surveillance. In 2012, an improved version of the OSF was deployed operationally. =Armament and standards= Initial deliveries of the Rafale M were to the F1 (\\"France 1\\") standard, these had been equipped for the air-to-air interceptor combat duties, but lacked any armament for air-to-ground operations.Wertheim 2007, pp. 202‚Äì203. Later deliveries were to the \\"F2\\" standard, which added the capability for conducting both air-to-ground and reconnaissance operations; the first F2 standard Rafale M was delivered to the French Navy in May 2006. Starting in 2008 onwards, Rafale deliveries have been to the nuclear-capable F3 standard, and it has been reported that all aircraft built to the earlier F1 and F2 standards are to be upgraded to become F3s. Weapons of the Rafale F3 standard Rafales are capable of undertaking many different mission roles with a range of equipment, namely air defence/superiority missions with Mica IR and EM air- to-air missiles, and precision ground attacks typically using SCALP EG cruise missiles and AASM Hammer air-to-surface missiles. In addition, anti-shipping missions could be carried out using the AM39 Exocet sea skimming missile, while reconnaissance flights would use a combination of onboard and external pod-based sensor equipment. Furthermore, the aircraft could conduct nuclear strikes when armed with ASMP-A missiles. In 2010, France ordered 200 MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles which will greatly increase the distance at which the Rafale can engage aerial targets when the missile enters service. The F4 standard program was launched on 20 March 2017 by the French ministry of defence.http://www.dassault-aviation.com/fr/dassault-aviation/presse/press- kits/rafale-vers-standard-f4/ date= 22 March 2017 For compatibility with armaments of varying types and origins, the Rafale's onboard store management system is compliant with MIL-STD-1760, an electrical interface between an aircraft and its carriage stores, thereby simplifying the incorporation of many of their existing weapons and equipment. The Rafale is typically outfitted with 14 hardpoints (only 13 on Rafale M version), five of which are suitable for heavy armament or equipment such as auxiliary fuel tanks, and has a maximum external load capacity of nine tons. In addition to the above equipment, the Rafale carries the 30 mm GIAT 30 revolver cannon and can be outfitted with a range of laser-guided bombs and ground-attack munitions. According to Dassault, the Rafale's onboard mission systems enable ground attack and air-to-air combat operations to be carried out within a single sortie, with many functions capable of simultaneous execution in conjunction with another, increasing survivability and versatility. =Engines= Closeup of the rear of the airframe and the two engine nozzles Rafale B in a clean configuration The Rafale is fitted with two Snecma M88 engines, each capable of providing up to of dry thrust and with afterburners. The engines feature several advances, including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, and technology to reduce radar and infrared signatures. The M88 enables the Rafale to supercruise while carrying four missiles and one drop tank. Qualification of the M88-2 engine ended in 1996 and the first production engine was delivered by the end of the year. Due to delays in engine production, the Rafale A demonstrator was initially powered by the General Electric F404 engine. In May 2010, a Rafale flew for the first time with the M88-4E engine, an upgraded variant with greater thrust and lower maintenance requirements than the preceding M88-2. The engine is of a modular design for ease of construction and maintenance and to enable older engines to be retrofitted with improved subsections upon availability, such as existing M88-2s being upgraded to M88-4E standard. There has been interest in more powerful M88 engines by potential export customers, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As of 2007, a thrust vectoring variant of the engine designated as M88-3D was also under development. Operational history =France= French Naval Aviation Two Rafale Ms aboard in 2008 In December 2000, the French Naval Aviation (A√©ronavale), the air arm of the French Navy, received its first two Rafale M fighters. On 18 May the following year, the squadron Flottille 12F, which had previously operated the F-8 Crusader, became the first squadron to operate the Rafale after it was officially re-activated prior to the delivery of the sixth Rafale. Flottille 12F immediately participated in Trident d'Or aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with warships from ten other nations. During the maritime exercise, the Navy tested the Rafale's avionics during simulated interceptions with various foreign aircraft, in addition to carrier take-offs and landings. After almost four years of training, the Rafale M was declared operational with the French Navy in June 2004. The Rafale M is fully compatible with US Navy aircraft carriers and some French Navy pilots have qualified to fly the aircraft from US Navy flight decks. On 4 June 2010, during an exercise on , a French Rafale became the first jet fighter of a foreign navy to have its engine replaced on board an American aircraft carrier. In 2002, the Rafales were first deployed to a combat zone; seven Rafale Ms embarked aboard Charles de Gaulle of the French Navy during \\"Mission H√©racl√®s\\", the French participation in \\"Operation Enduring Freedom\\". They flew from the aircraft carrier over Afghanistan, but the F1 standard precluded air-to-ground missions and the Rafale did not see any action. In June 2002, while Charles de Gaulle was in the Arabian Sea, Rafales conducted several patrols near the India- Pakistan border.\\"En Garde!\\" Journal of Electronic Defense. August 2002. In 2016, Rafales operating from Charles de Gaulle struck targets associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In December 2015, American and French military officials reportedly discussed the possibility of French naval Rafale Ms flying combat missions from a US Navy as soon as January 2017. This would enable continued French Navy operations against ISIL while Charles de Gaulle undergoes its year-and-a-half-long major refit, scheduled to begin in early 2017. Although Rafales have launched and landed on U.S. carriers to demonstrate interoperability, it would be the first time they would fly combat missions from one. As many as 18 Rafale Ms could be deployed on a carrier, although some room would have to be made for French Navy support crews familiar with maintaining the Rafale, as well as for spare parts and munitions. Operation Chesapeake, a test of this interoperability, was conducted in May 2018, when 12 Rafales of Flottilles 11F, 12F, and 17F, along with nearly 350 support personnel embarked aboard USS George H.W. Bush for two weeks of carrier qualifications and exercises after conducting a month of shore based training at Naval Air Station Oceana. Navy Times. Retrieved 10 May 2018. French Air Force Formation of five Rafales making a flypast in 2006 Rafales were delivered to the French Air Force several years after the naval variant, initially with the Centre d'Exp√©riences A√©riennes Militaires (French Air Force Evaluation Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base in the trials and training role. By this time, it was expected that Escadron de Chasse (Fighter Squadron) 1/7 at Saint-Dizier would receive a nucleus of 8‚Äì10 Rafale F2s during the summer of 2006, in preparation for full operational service (with robust air-to-air and stand off air-to-ground precision attack capabilities) starting from mid-2007 (when EC 1/7 would have about 20 aircraft, 15 two-seaters and five single-seaters). In 2007, after a \\"crash program\\" enhancement six Rafales were given the ability to drop laser-guided bombs, in view of engaging them in Afghanistan. Three of these aircraft belonging to the Air Force were deployed to Dushanbe in Tajikistan, while the three others were Rafale Marine of the Navy on board Charles De Gaulle. The first mission occurred on 12 March 2007, and the first GBU-12 was launched on 28 March in support of embattled Dutch troops in Southern Afghanistan, marking the operational d√©but of the Rafale. Between January 2009 and December 2011, a minimum of three Rafales were stationed at Kandahar International Airport to conduct combat operations in support of NATO ground forces. On 19 March 2011, French Rafales began conducting reconnaissance and strike missions over Libya in Op√©ration Harmattan, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973; initial targets were artillery pieces laying siege around the rebel city of Benghazi. The Rafale could operate in Libya without the support of SEAD aircraft, using the onboard SPECTRA self-defence system instead. On 24 March 2011, it was reported that a Rafale had destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light attack/trainer aircraft on the runway. During the conflict, Rafales typically conducted six-hour sorties over Libyan airspace, carrying an armament of four MICA air-to-air missiles, four or six AASM \\"Hammer\\" bombs, a Thales Damocl√®s targeting pod and two drop tanks; these patrols required multiple aerial refuelling operations per sortie from coalition tanker aircraft. The AASM precision-guidance weapon system, using bombs weighing between and , allowed the Rafale to conduct high-altitude bombing missions. Reportedly, Rafale crews preferred to use GPS-guided munitions due to greater reliability and range. Storm Shadow SCALP weapons were deployed on only one or two sorties, including one against a Libyan airbase at Al-Jufra. In 2011, aviation journalist Craig Hoyle speculated that the Rafale's performance in Libya is likely to be pivotal to its export future, reporting that the Rafale had maintained a high operational rate throughout the deployment. Hoyle also noted that the Libyan combat experience had caused several urgent operational requirements to present themselves, such as the need for a lighter ground- attack munition and to modify the AASM weapon to be more effective in the close air support role. A French Air Force Rafale B during Operation Serval in Mali, 2013 In January 2013, the Rafale took part in \\"Op√©ration Serval\\", the French military intervention in support to the government of Mali against the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa. The first mission was carried out on 13 January, when four Rafales took off from an airbase in France to strike rebel training camps, depots and facilities in the city of Gao, eastern Mali. Subsequent airstrikes in the following days by Rafale and Mirage fighters were reportedly instrumental in the withdrawal of Islamist militant forces from Timbuktu and Douentza. Both Rafale and Mirage 2000D aircraft used in the conflict have been based outside of North Africa, making use of aerial refuelling tanker aircraft to fly long range sorties across Algerian airspace and into Mali. In August 2013, it was proposed that France may halve the number of Rafales to be delivered over the next six years for a total of 26 aircraft to be delivered during this period; foreign export procurements have been viewed as critical to maintain production under this proposal. While production would be slowed, France would still receive the same number of Rafales overall. In September 2014, Rafales began flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq as part of Op√©ration Chammal, France's contribution to the international effort to combat Islamic State (IS) militants. Six (later nine) Rafales were initially tasked with identifying IS positions in support of US airstrikes, flying from Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE. On 18 September, Rafales joined American operations in conducting attacks, launching four strikes near the Northern Iraqi town of Zummar that destroyed a logistics depot and killed dozens of IS fighters. In April 2018, during the Syrian Civil War, five Rafale B fighters from the Escadron de Chasse 1/4 Gascogne participated in the 2018 missile strikes against Syria. Each jet was loaded with two SCALP EG missiles. =Egypt= In November 2014, Egypt was reportedly in negotiations with France to purchase 24 to 36 Rafales, subject to a financing agreement. By February 2015, the two countries were negotiating a loan from France's export credit agency to reach an export agreement for up to 24 Rafale fighters. Egypt hoped to complete deal quickly to have aircraft on display at the inauguration of the Suez Canal expansion in August 2015. On 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Rafale's first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales, as part of a larger deal, including a FREMM multipurpose frigate and missiles, worth US$5.9 billion (‚Ç¨5.2 billion). The order comprised 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters. In July 2015, a ceremony marking Egypt's acceptance of its first three Rafales, was held at Dassault's flight test center in Istres. In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafales for a total of six fighters. All six aircraft are two-seat models (Rafale DM) diverted from deliveries to the French Air Force. Egypt received the third batch of three Rafales flown by Egyptian pilots from France in April 2017; this was included the first single- seat model (Rafale EM) to be delivered to the Egyptian Air Force. Egypt took delivery of the fourth batch of two Rafale EMs in July 2017. The fifth batch, comprising the last 3 Rafale EMs, was delivered in November 2017, increasing the number in service to 14 Rafales. In June 2016, Egypt started negotiations with Dassault to acquire 12 additional Rafales, intending to exercise an option of the first contract. An Egyptian delegation visited France in November 2017 for negotiations. =Qatar= A Qatari Rafale at Bordeaux‚ÄìM√©rignac Airport in 2019. Starting in 2011, the Qatar Emiri Air Force evaluated the Rafale alongside the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Boeing F-15E, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II to replace its Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fleet. In June 2014, Dassault claimed it was close to signing a contract with Qatar for 72 Rafales. On 30 April 2015, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani announced to French President Fran√ßois Hollande that Qatar would order 24 Rafale with an option to buy 12 more aircraft. On 4 May, a ‚Ç¨6.3 billion ($7.02 billion) contract for 24 Rafales was finalised; additionally, the contract included the provision of long-range cruise missiles and Meteor missiles as well as the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French military and several Qatari intelligence officers; thus, the price can be viewed as ‚Ç¨M for each aircraft. On 7 December 2017, the option for 12 more Rafales was exercised for ‚Ç¨1.1 billion (or ‚Ç¨M each) while adding an additional option for 36 further fighters. The first Qatari Rafale was delivered in February 2019. =India= Rafale of the Indian Air Force. The Rafale was one of the six aircraft competing in the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole fighters. Originally, the Mirage 2000 had been considered for the competition, but Dassault withdrew it in favour of the Rafale. In February 2011, French Rafales flew demonstrations in India, including air-to-air combat against Su-30MKIs. In April 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) shortlisted the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon for the US$10.4 billion contract. On 31 January 2012, the IAF announced the Rafale as the preferred bidder. It was proposed that 18 Rafales would be supplied to the IAF by 2015 in fly-away condition, while the remaining 108 would be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India under transfer of technology agreements. The contract for 126 Rafales, services, and parts may have been worth up to US$20 billion. The deal stalled due to disagreements over production in India. Dassault refused to take responsibility for the 108 HAL-manufactured Rafales, holding reservations over HAL's ability to accommodate the aircraft's complex manufacturing and technology transfers; instead, Dassault said it would have to negotiate two separate production contracts by both companies. The Indian Defence Ministry instead wanted Dassault to be solely responsible for the sale and delivery of all 126 aircraft. In May 2013, The Times of India reported that negotiations were \\"back on track\\", with plans for the first 18 Rafales to be delivered in 2017. Another point of contention was a provision where Dassault was to reinvest 50 percent of the deal's earnings into India's defence sectors, either through purchases or technological expertise. In March 2014, the two sides reportedly agreed that the first 18 Rafales would be delivered to India in flying condition and that the remaining 108 would be 70 percent built by HAL. By December 2014, India and France reportedly expected to sign a contract by March 2015. A Rafale landing at Ambala Air Force Station on its first arrival in India on 29 July 2020. In April 2015, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Paris, India requested the rapid delivery of 36 Rafales in a fly-away condition. Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar stated that these will be inducted into the IAF within two years. India officially withdrew the 126-aircraft MMRCA tender on 30 July 2015. Shortly after, India and France missed the July target to finalise the 36-aircraft agreement. The previously-agreed-upon terms in April totaled US$8 billion for 36 aircraft costing $200 million each, with an offset requirement of 30 percent of the deal's value to be reinvested in India's defence sector and create infrastructure for Rafale operations. India insisted on a 50 percent offset and two bases, which France said would increase costs and require separate infrastructure and two sets of maintenance, training and armament storage facilities. In January 2016, the Indian government directed the Indian Navy to be briefed by Dassault on the navalised Rafale for its aircraft carriers, promoting logistics and spares commonalities between Navy and Air Force fighters. Dassault CEO Eric Trappier stated that the Indian Navy may order up to 57 Rafales. On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian signed a ‚Ç¨7.8 billion contract for 36 off-the-shelf Rafales with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price. The first Rafales were expected to be delivered by 2019, and India is set to have all 36 within six years. The deal includes weapons and spares, which included Meteor BVRAAM missiles. India considered ordering 36 more Rafales around August 2017 amid tensions with China. The Indian National Congress raised an issue over Dassault partnering with Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence, now known as Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited(R-Naval), a private company with no aviation experience, instead of the state owned HAL. Allegedly, Dassault was not given a choice and was compelled to select Reliance Defence as its partner; Gandhi alleged that it was favouritism and corruption. Both the French government and Dassault issued a press release stating it was Dassault's decision to choose Reliance Defence. Party spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for the agreement's details to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ‚Çπ7.15 billion to ‚Çπ16 billion. In November 2018, Congress alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in the Rafale's acquisition. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case was filed in the Supreme Court for an independent probe into the Rafale procurement. On 14 December 2018, based on all pricing details along with finalising steps, the Apex Court dismissed all petitions, stating it found no irregularities in the buy; Reliance Defence reportedly was set to receive just over 3 per cent of the of offsets, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal. In March 2019, Indian government officials asked for Rafales to replace ageing MiG-21s and to counter Pakistan's newer F-16s. Ahead of the first Rafale's formal hand over on 8 October 2019, The Indian Air Force Day 2019, the IAF accepted the aircraft at Dassault's Bordeaux manufacturing facility in an event attended by Defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart; it had tail number \\"RB-001\\" to mark IAF chief-designate Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria's role in the 2016 deal. In 2018, it was reported that the Rafale is competing against several other aircraft in a new procurement tender for 114 multi-role combat aircraft, which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media.http://sps-aviation.com/story/?id=2370&h;=MMRCA-20-Contenders Delivery of 36 Rafales started on 27 July 2020 with first 5 Rafales delivered to Indian Airforce from France. =Potential operators= Analysts view the relatively quick series of 84 orders from Egypt and Qatar as being influenced by the Arab Spring and uncertainty of US involvement in the Middle East. Finland In June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the so-called HX program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. In December 2015 Finnish MoD sent a letter to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the United States where it informed that the fighter project was launched in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. Dassault Rafale is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The project has been named as HX Fighter Program. The request for information concerning the program was sent in early 2016; the five responses were received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021. Malaysia The Rafale was a contender for the replacement of the Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF) Mikoyan MiG-29, with a requirement to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighter aircraft with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion (US$1.84 billion to US$2.46 billion). The other competitors for the program were the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18/F Super Hornet and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. In July 2017, the plan to acquire new jet fighters was suspended with the Royal Malaysian Air Force looking instead to buy new maritime patrol aircraft and advanced trainers with light attack capabilities to confront the growing threat of Islamist militants in the Southeast Asian region. Switzerland In February 2007, it was reported that Switzerland was considering the Rafale and other fighters to replace its ageing Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs.Le Temps, 13 February 2007. A one- month evaluation started in October 2008 at Emmen Airforce Base, consisting of approximately 30 evaluation flights; the Rafale, along with the JAS 39 Gripen and the Typhoon, were evaluated. Although a leaked Swiss Air Force evaluation report revealed that the Rafale won the competition on technical grounds, on 30 November 2011, the Swiss Federal Council announced that plans to buy 22 Gripen NGs due to the its lower acquisition and maintenance costs. Due to a referendum, this purchase never happened. In March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35. In October 2018, the Swiss Air Force was reportedly limited to buying a single-engine fighter for budgetary reasons. In May 2019, the Rafale performed demonstration flights at Payerne Air Base for comparison against other bids. United Arab Emirates In 2009, the United Arab Emirates Air Force was interested in an upgraded version of the Rafale with more powerful engines and radar, and advanced air-to-air missiles. In October 2011, Dassault was confident that a US$10 billion deal for up to 60 Rafale aircraft would be signed. However, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Union Defence Force, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in November 2011 called the French offer \\"uncompetitive and unworkable\\"; France had in 2010 asked the UAE to pay US$2.6 billion of the total cost to upgrade the Rafale. Consequently, the UAE started to explore a purchase of the Eurofighter Typhoon or the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The newspaper La Tribune reported in February 2012, that the UAE was still considering the US$10-billion deal for 60 Rafales. Interoperability among the Gulf air forces has led to renewed interest in the Rafale from Qatar and Kuwait. In January 2013, President Hollande stated that he would be discussing the potential sale of Rafale to the UAE during an official visit. In December 2013, it was announced that UAE had decided not to proceed with a deal for the supply of defence and security services, including the supply of Typhoon aircraft. In September 2014 it was announced that the UAE could acquire 40 Rafales in addition to upgrades to its existing Mirage 2000s. In November 2015, Reuters reported that Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, had confirmed that the UAE was in final negotiations to purchase 60 Rafales. In 2019 a series of Rafale F3-R trials were conducted at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE. Greece It was reported that Greece and France had reached an agreement on purchase of 10 new Rafales and donation of 8 more used ones from French Air Force stocks. The official announcement is expected in 2020. On 12 September 2020, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis officially announced the intent to purchase 18 Rafale aircraft from France. =Others= Spain is looking for 68-72 fighters to replace its F/A-18A/B Hornets. Possible participants in the tender will be the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Advanced Super Hornet and Lockheed F-35 Lightning II. In January 2020, the Indonesian government expressed some interest in buying up to 48 Rafales to modernise its air force. =Failed bids= The Rafale has been marketed for export to various countries. Various commentators and industry sources have highlighted the high cost of the aircraft as detrimental to the Rafale's sales prospects. Its acquisition cost is roughly US$100 million (2010), while its operational cost hovers around US$16,500 (2012) for every flight-hour. The Saab JAS Gripen, in comparison, costs only US$4,700 per flight-hour to operate. According to a 2009 article by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, unlike the American government and its relationship with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the lack of communication between the French government and Dassault has hampered a worldwide cooperative sales effort, as demonstrated by the case with Morocco in 2007. Belgium France offered economic and technology partnerships in its bid for the Rafale to replace Belgium's fleet of 34 aging F-16A/B MLU fighters starting in 2023 as part of the air combat capability successor program. Other competitors were the Eurofighter Typhoon and Lockheed Martin F-35. On 25 October 2018, Belgium selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace around 54 F-16s; government officials stated that the decision came down to price and that \\"The offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven valuation criteria\\"; the total purchasing price for the aircraft and support until 2030 totaled ‚Ç¨4 billion, ‚Ç¨600 million cheaper than the initial budget of ‚Ç¨4.6 billion. Brazil In June 2008, the Brazilian Air Force issued a request for information on the following aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16 Fighting Falcon, Rafale, Su-35, Gripen NG and Eurofighter Typhoon. In October 2008, the service selected three finalists for F-X2 ‚Äì Dassault Rafale, Gripen NG and Boeing F/A-18E/F. On 5 January 2010, media reports stated that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Gripen ahead of the other two contenders based on unit and operating costs. In February 2011, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had reportedly decided in favour of the F/A-18. After delays due to budget constraints, in December 2013, the Brazilian government selected the Gripen NG in a US$5 billion deal to equip the air force. Canada The Rafale was amongst various fighters proposed to meet Canada's need to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fleet. In 2005, according to Canada.com, a report compiled by Canada's Defence Department reviewing several aircraft noted concerns over the Rafale's interoperability with US forces; Dassault had also then been unable to confirm engine performance during cold weather conditions. In July 2010, the Canadian government announced the CF-18's replacement would be the F-35; the nation was already a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program since 1997 and a Tier 3 partner for the F-35 since 2002. In December 2012, the Canadian government announced that the F-35 purchase had been abandoned due to cost rises and that a fresh procurement process would begin. In January 2013, Dassault responded to a Canadian request for information, announcing its readiness to enter the competition. Various aircraft were considered to meet the requirement, including the F-35. In January 2014, Dassault reportedly offered a contract with full transfer of technology, allowing Canada to perform its own support and upgrades, thereby lowering long-term service costs. In November 2018, Dassault withdrew from the competition, reportedly due to extensive interoperability and intelligence sharing requirements, particularly with U.S. forces, complicated by France's lack of involvement in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community. Kuwait In February 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that Kuwait was considering buying up to 28 Rafales. In October 2009, during a visit to Paris, the Kuwaiti Defence Minister expressed interest in the Rafale and said that he was awaiting Dassault's terms. Islamist lawmakers in the Kuwaiti national assembly threatened to block such a purchase, accusing the Defence Minister of lack of transparency and being manipulated by business interests. In January 2012, the French Defence Minister said that both Kuwait and Qatar were waiting to see if the UAE first purchased the Rafale and that Kuwait would look to buy 18‚Äì22 Rafales. However, on 11 September 2015, Eurofighter announced that an agreement had been reached with Kuwait to buy 28 Typhoons. Libya In January 2007, the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported that Libya sought 13 to 18 Rafales \\"in a deal worth as much as US$3.24 billion\\". In December 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi declared Libya's interest in the Rafale, but no order was placed. French Rafales later attacked targets in Libya as part of the international military intervention during the 2011 Libyan civil war. Singapore In 2005, the Republic of Singapore Air Force embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace its fleet of ageing A-4SU Super Skyhawks. A number of options were considered and the Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) conducted a detailed technical assessment, as well as simulations and other tests to determine the final selection. Following this, the original list of competitors was reduced to the final two ‚Äì Dassault Rafale and the F-15SG Strike Eagle. In December 2005, Singapore ordered 12 F-15SG aircraft. According to Defense Industry Daily, one major reason for the selection was that, while the Rafale had superior aerodynamics, it lacked the range and a capable radar, and had insufficient weapons and sensor integration. Others In 2002, the Republic of Korea Air Force chose the F-15K Slam Eagle over the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Sukhoi Su-35 for its 40 aircraft F-X Phase 1 fighter competition. In late 2007, La Tribune reported that a prospective US$2.85 billion sale to Morocco had fallen through, the government selecting the F-16C/D instead. While French Defense Minister Herve Morin labelled it as overly sophisticated and too costly, defense analysists have said that miscalculations of the DGA's offer price and hesitations over financing were detrimental to the negotiations. In February 2009, France offered Rafales to Oman to replace its ageing fleet of SEPECAT Jaguars. In December 2012, Oman placed an order for 12 Typhoons.

Consequently, the Rafale M weighs about more than the Rafale C.Williams 2002, pp. 94‚Äì95.

In 1538 Rabus became a student at University of T√ºbingen, and graduated M.A. in 1543. In the following years Rabus became Zell's assistant, made a reputation as a preachers, and in 1548 was Zell's successor. The Augsburg Interim meant he lost his post, but he remained in Strasbourg. In 1552 he became head of the Collegium Wilhelmitanum and teacher at the High School; in 1553 together with Jacob Andreae he was awarded a T√ºbingen doctorate. When the Strasbourg council favoured Johannes Marbach, Rabus left the city, where he was regarded as something of a fanatic, and went as minister and dean to Ulm, where he worked for 34 years. In the controversy around Kaspar Schwenckfeld he wrote against Katharina Zell, who defended herself; what had been a long-running private disagreement about her husband's legacy became a public quarrel.Elsie Anne McKee, Church Mother: the writings of a Protestant reformer in sixteenth- century Germany (2006), p. 179; Google Books.

Male Western moose are aggressive during mating season (autumn and winter) and may injure or kill with provocation. Habitat, range, and distribution The Western moose inhabits British Columbia, eastern Yukon, Northwest Territories, southwestern Nunavut, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, western Ontario, the upper peninsula of Michigan, northern Wisconsin, northern Minnesota, and northeastern North Dakota. Parks Canada transferred eighteen western moose from Elk Island National Park to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1949 for population increase.

Social structure and reproduction Western moose cow and calf in Bowron Lake Provincial Park Western moose do not form social bonds and only come into contact to mate or to battle for a mate. Elevated testosterone levels during mating season mean that bulls may attack anything during mating season, including humans, coyotes, wild boars, deer, red foxes, cougars, wolf packs, Grizzly bears, elk, and black bears. They use a subtle mating call to attract females or to announce to other males that they are in the area. In the event of a fight over mating rights, bull moose risk locking their antlers, which almost always results in them both dying from starvation. Western moose females will have, on average, one or two calves at once. A female may attack if she feels that her calves are threatened, although, at around 10‚Äì11 months yearling Western moose are chased off by their mothers to fend for themselves.

In geometry, the parallel postulate, also called Euclid's fifth postulate because it is the fifth postulate in Euclid's Elements, is a distinctive axiom in Euclidean geometry. It states that, in two-dimensional geometry: > If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles > on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, > if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less > than two right angles. This postulate does not specifically talk about parallel lines;non-Euclidean geometries, by Dr. Katrina Piatek-Jimenez it is only a postulate related to parallelism. Euclid gave the definition of parallel lines in Book I, Definition 23Euclid's Elements, Book I, Definition 23 just before the five postulates.Euclid's Elements, Book I Euclidean geometry is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms, including the parallel postulate. The postulate was long considered to be obvious or inevitable, but proofs were elusive. Eventually it was discovered that inverting the postulate gave valid, albeit different geometries. A geometry where the parallel postulate does not hold is known as a non-Euclidean geometry. Geometry that is independent of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the modern equivalent of the first four postulates) is known as absolute geometry (or sometimes \\"neutral geometry\\"). Equivalent properties Probably the best known equivalent of Euclid's parallel postulate, contingent on his other postulates, is Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish mathematician John Playfair, which states: > In a plane, given a line and a point not on it, at most one line parallel to > the given line can be drawn through the point.Euclid's Parallel Postulate > and Playfair's Axiom This axiom by itself is not logically equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate since there are geometries in which one is true and the other is not. However, in the presence of the remaining axioms which give Euclidean geometry, each of these can be used to prove the other, so they are equivalent in the context of absolute geometry. Many other statements equivalent to the parallel postulate have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so self-evident that they were unconsciously assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates. These equivalent statements include: # There is at most one line that can be drawn parallel to another given one through an external point. (Playfair's axiom) # The sum of the angles in every triangle is 180¬∞ (triangle postulate). # There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180¬∞. # The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle. # There exists a pair of similar, but not congruent, triangles. # Every triangle can be circumscribed. # If three angles of a quadrilateral are right angles, then the fourth angle is also a right angle. # There exists a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles, that is, a rectangle. # There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant distance from each other. # Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other. # In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (Pythagoras' Theorem). #The Law of cosines, a general case of Pythagoras' Theorem. # There is no upper limit to the area of a triangle. (Wallis axiom) # The summit angles of the Saccheri quadrilateral are 90¬∞. # If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, both of which are coplanar with the original line, then it also intersects the other. (Proclus' axiom) However, the alternatives which employ the word \\"parallel\\" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the four common definitions of \\"parallel\\" is meant ‚Äì constant separation, never meeting, same angles where crossed by some third line, or same angles where crossed by any third line ‚Äì since the equivalence of these four is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate. In the list above, it is always taken to refer to non-intersecting lines. For example, if the word \\"parallel\\" in Playfair's axiom is taken to mean 'constant separation' or 'same angles where crossed by any third line', then it is no longer equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate, and is provable from the first four (the axiom says 'There is at most one line...', which is consistent with there being no such lines). However, if the definition is taken so that parallel lines are lines that do not intersect, or that have some line intersecting them in the same angles, Playfair's axiom is contextually equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate and is thus logically independent of the first four postulates. Note that the latter two definitions are not equivalent, because in hyperbolic geometry the second definition holds only for ultraparallel lines. History For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that, unlike the first four postulates, the parallel postulate is not self- evident. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. Many attempts were made to prove the fifth postulate from the other four, many of them being accepted as proofs for long periods until the mistake was found. Invariably the mistake was assuming some 'obvious' property which turned out to be equivalent to the fifth postulate (Playfair's axiom). Although known from the time of Proclus, this became known as Playfair's Axiom after John Playfair wrote a famous commentary on Euclid in 1795 in which he proposed replacing Euclid's fifth postulate by his own axiom. Proclus (410‚Äì485) wrote a commentary on The Elements where he comments on attempted proofs to deduce the fifth postulate from the other four; in particular, he notes that Ptolemy had produced a false 'proof'. Proclus then goes on to give a false proof of his own. However, he did give a postulate which is equivalent to the fifth postulate. Ibn al- Haytham (Alhazen) (965-1039), an Arab mathematician, made an attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a proof by contradiction, in the course of which he introduced the concept of motion and transformation into geometry.: He formulated the Lambert quadrilateral, which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the \\"Ibn al-Haytham‚ÄìLambert quadrilateral\\", and his attempted proof contains elements similar to those found in Lambert quadrilaterals and Playfair's axiom. The Persian mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, and poet Omar Khayy√°m (1050‚Äì1123), attempted to prove the fifth postulate from another explicitly given postulate (based on the fourth of the five principles due to the Philosopher (Aristotle), namely, \\"Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge.\\"Boris A Rosenfeld and Adolf P Youschkevitch (1996), Geometry, p.467 in Roshdi Rashed, R√©gis Morelon (1996), Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science, Routledge, . He derived some of the earlier results belonging to elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though his postulate excluded the latter possibility.Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), \\"Geometry\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, p. 447-494 [469], Routledge, London and New York: The Saccheri quadrilateral was also first considered by Omar Khayy√°m in the late 11th century in Book I of Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid. Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri), Khayy√°m was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from his equivalent postulate. He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's fifth postulate; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's fifth postulate, otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He showed that the acute and obtuse cases led to contradictions using his postulate, but his postulate is now known to be equivalent to the fifth postulate. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201‚Äì1274), in his Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya (Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayy√°m's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. He also considered the cases of what are now known as elliptical and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry. Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as \\"Pseudo-Tusi\\"), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on his father's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non- Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. \\"He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the Elements.\\"Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), \\"Geometry\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, p. 447-494 [469], Routledge, London and New York: His work was published in Rome in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject: which opened with a criticism of Sadr al-Din's work and the work of Wallis.MacTutor's Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri Giordano Vitale (1633-1711), in his book Euclide restituo (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant. Girolamo Saccheri (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to refute the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had). In 1766 Johann Lambert wrote, but did not publish, Theorie der Parallellinien in which he attempted, as Saccheri did, to prove the fifth postulate. He worked with a figure that today we call a Lambert quadrilateral, a quadrilateral with three right angles (can be considered half of a Saccheri quadrilateral). He quickly eliminated the possibility that the fourth angle is obtuse, as had Saccheri and Khayy√°m, and then proceeded to prove many theorems under the assumption of an acute angle. Unlike Saccheri, he never felt that he had reached a contradiction with this assumption. He had proved the non-Euclidean result that the sum of the angles in a triangle increases as the area of the triangle decreases, and this led him to speculate on the possibility of a model of the acute case on a sphere of imaginary radius. He did not carry this idea any further. Where Khayy√°m and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the logically consistent geometries which result. In 1829, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831, J√°nos Bolyai included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky. Carl Friedrich Gauss had also studied the problem, but he did not publish any of his results. Upon hearing of Bolyai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father, Farkas Bolyai, Gauss stated: > \\"If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would > certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise > it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the > path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost > entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the > last thirty or thirty-five years.\\" The resulting geometries were later developed by Lobachevsky, Riemann and Poincar√© into hyperbolic geometry (the acute case) and elliptic geometry (the obtuse case). The independence of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by Eugenio Beltrami in 1868. Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate The converse of the parallel postulate: If the sum of the two interior angles equals 180¬∞, then the lines are parallel and will never intersect. Euclid did not postulate the converse of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from elliptic geometry. The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 27): If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be parallel to one another. As De MorganHeath, T.L., The thirteen books of Euclid's Elements, Vol.1, Dover, 1956, pg.309. pointed out, this is logically equivalent to (Book I, Proposition 16). These results do not depend upon the fifth postulate, but they do require the second postulateCoxeter, H.S.M., Non-Euclidean Geometry, 6th Ed., MAA 1998, pg.3 which is violated in elliptic geometry. Criticism Attempts to logically prove the parallel postulate, rather than the eighth axiom,Schopenhauer is referring to Euclid's Common Notion 4: Figures coinciding with one another are equal to one another. were criticized by Arthur Schopenhauer. However, the argument used by Schopenhauer was that the postulate is evident by perception, not that it was not a logical consequence of the other axioms.

It was located on 5th Street and Alton Road in Miami Beach, Florida and 36th Street and Collins Avenue. It subsisted mainly on city funding and community support; there was at least one federal grant in the beginning. Its founder was Daytop alumni Norman Levinsky, Audrey D‚ÄôAmato, Warren Klein and Jerry Kreidman. Program staff included former drug addicts who had spent years in full-time drug rehab programs, a probation officer named Robert (Bob) Caperton, Maurice Soniat, as well as program graduates. Operation Re-Entry catered to mostly teenagers in the early stages of drug abuse. Program members would be confronted with their behavior and punished, followed by guidance on alternative behaviors. Confrontational methods called \\"verbal haircuts\\" were used to \\"break through\\" a member's defensive barriers. More difficult cases would be given work assignments, actual haircuts, or tasks that many considered humiliating. The purpose was to lower the member's defenses and open them to examining the cause of their behavior. Group therapy and positive reinforcement from other members completed their rehabilitation. These tactics were called \\"reality therapy\\" and proved very successful with the older alcoholics of the Synanon era. Almost all drug rehabilitation programs of the 1970s were based on this formula. However, in retrospect, this approach may have been too heavy-handed for teenagers. The program eventually evolved in its treatment to include other approaches by the late 1970s. The program closed in 1980 due to a combination of bad administration, politics and funding cuts. Operation Re- Entry treated over 1,000 members during its existence.

It is equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate in the context of Euclidean geometrymore precisely, in the context of absolute geometry. and was named after the Scottish mathematician John Playfair. The \\"at most\\" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists. The statement is often written with the phrase, \\"there is one and only one parallel\\". In Euclid's Elements, two lines are said to be parallel if they never meet and other characterizations of parallel lines are not used.Euclid's elements, Book I, definition 23 This axiom is used not only in Euclidean geometry but also in the broader study of affine geometry where the concept of parallelism is central. In the affine geometry setting, the stronger form of Playfair's axiom (where \\"at most\\" is replaced by \\"one and only one\\") is needed since the axioms of neutral geometry are not present to provide a proof of existence. Playfair's version of the axiom has become so popular that it is often referred to as Euclid's parallel axiom,for instance, Rafael Artzy (1965) Linear Geometry, page 202, Addison-Wesley even though it was not Euclid's version of the axiom. A corollary of the axiom is that the binary relation of parallel lines is a serial relation. History Proclus (410-485 A.D.) clearly makes the statement in his commentary on Euclid I.31 (Book I, Proposition 31) In 1785 William Ludlam expressed the parallel axiom as follows:William Ludlam (1785) The Rudiments of Mathematics, p. 145, Cambridge :Two straight lines, meeting at a point, are not both parallel to a third line. This brief expression of Euclidean parallelism was adopted by Playfair in his textbook Elements of Geometry (1795) that was republished often. He wrote :Two straight lines which intersect one another cannot be both parallel to the same straight line. Playfair acknowledged Ludlam and others for simplifying the Euclidean assertion. In later developments the point of intersection of the two lines came first, and the denial of two parallels became expressed as a unique parallel through the given point. In 1883 Arthur Cayley was president of the British Association and expressed this opinion in his address to the Association:William Barrett Frankland (1910) Theories of Parallelism: A Historic Critique, page 31, Cambridge University Press :My own view is that Euclid's Twelfth Axiom in Playfair's form of it, does not need demonstration, but is part of our notion of space, of the physical space of our experience, which is the representation lying at the bottom of all external experience. When David Hilbert wrote his book, Foundations of Geometry (1899), providing a new set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, he used Playfair's form of the axiom instead of the original Euclidean version for discussing parallel lines. Relation with Euclid's fifth postulate If the sum of the interior angles Œ± and Œ≤ is less than 180¬∞, the two straight lines, produced indefinitely, meet on that side. Euclid's parallel postulate states: > If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles > on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, > if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less > than two right angles.George Phillips (1826) Elements of Geometry > (containing the first six books of Euclid), p. 3, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy The complexity of this statement when compared to Playfair's formulation is certainly a leading contribution to the popularity of quoting Playfair's axiom in discussions of the parallel postulate. Within the context of absolute geometry the two statements are equivalent, meaning that each can be proved by assuming the other in the presence of the remaining axioms of the geometry. This is not to say that the statements are logically equivalent (i.e., one can be proved from the other using only formal manipulations of logic), since, for example, when interpreted in the spherical model of elliptical geometry one statement is true and the other isn't. Logically equivalent statements have the same truth value in all models in which they have interpretations. The proofs below assume that all the axioms of absolute (neutral) geometry are valid. =Euclid's fifth postulate implies Playfair's axiom= The easiest way to show this is using the Euclidean theorem (equivalent to the fifth postulate) that states that the angles of a triangle sum to two right angles. Given a line \\\\ell and a point P not on that line, construct a line, t, perpendicular to the given one through the point P, and then a perpendicular to this perpendicular at the point P. This line is parallel because it cannot meet \\\\ell and form a triangle, which is stated in Book 1 Proposition 27 in Euclid's Elements.This argument assumes more than is needed to prove the result. There are proofs of the existence of parallels which do not assume an equivalent of the fifth postulate. Now it can be seen that no other parallels exist. If n was a second line through P, then n makes an acute angle with t (since it is not the perpendicular) and the hypothesis of the fifth postulate holds, and so, n meets \\\\ell. =Playfair's axiom implies Euclid's fifth postulate= Given that Playfair's postulate implies that only the perpendicular to the perpendicular is a parallel, the lines of the Euclid construction will have to cut each other in a point. It is also necessary to prove that they will do it in the side where the angles sum to less than two right angles, but this is more difficult.The proof may be found in Transitivity of parallelism Proposition 30 of Euclid reads, \\"Two lines, each parallel to a third line, are parallel to each other.\\" It was notedSupplementary Remarks on the first six Books of Euclid's Elements in the Companion to the Almanac, 1849. by Augustus De Morgan that this proposition is logically equivalent to Playfair‚Äôs axiom. This notice was recounted by T. L. Heath in 1908. De Morgan‚Äôs argument runs as follows: Let X be the set of pairs of distinct lines which meet and Y the set of distinct pairs of lines each of which is parallel to a single common line. If z represents a pair of distinct lines, then the statement, : For all z, if z is in X then z is not in Y, is Playfair's axiom (in De Morgan's terms, No X is Y) and its logically equivalent contrapositive, : For all z, if z is in Y then z is not in X, is Euclid I.30, the transitivity of parallelism (No Y is X). More recently the implication has been phrased differently in terms of the binary relation expressed by parallel lines: In affine geometry the relation is taken to be an equivalence relation, which means that a line is considered to be parallel to itself. Andy LiuThe College Mathematics Journal 42(5):372 wrote, \\"Let P be a point not on line 2. Suppose both line 1 and line 3 pass through P and are parallel to line 2. By transitivity, they are parallel to each other, and hence cannot have exactly P in common. It follows that they are the same line, which is Playfair's axiom.\\" Notes References  * : (3 vols.): (vol. 1), (vol. 2), (vol. 3).

Its closest relatives appear to be the tropicbirds of the tropical Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. Classification The affinities of Eurypygiformes are not very well resolved. The group consists of two families from a Gondwanan lineage of birds. Based on some morphological characteristics, they were initially classed as members of the family Ardeidae, and later the Gruiformes. According to Jarvis, et al.'s 2014 \\"Whole-genome analyses resolve early branches in the tree of life of modern birds\\", the group is distantly related to the Phaethontiformes.\\"Whole-genome analyses resolve early branches in the tree of life of modern birds\\" Erich D. Jarvis, et al., Science 12 December 2014: Vol. 346 no. 6215 pp. 1320-1331 DOI: 10.1126/science.1253451 When seen as a gruiform, the kagu is generally considered related to the extinct adzebills from New Zealand and the sunbittern from Central and South America. Recent studies do indicate that the sunbittern is the closest living relative of the kagu. For example, Fain & Houde found these to be certainly sister taxa and Furo et al. indicated a close phylogenetic relationship between them by cytotaxonomy; they suggest that their common ancestor was separated by the Gondwana vicariance in South America and New Caledonia, respectively. They and the mesites did not group with traditional Gruiformes in their study, but instead with their proposed clade Metaves, which also includes the hoatzin, pigeons, Caprimulgiformes, flamingos, tropicbirds, Apodiformes, sandgrouse and grebes. The internal structure of this group was not well resolvable by their data, and contains numerous groupings not otherwise corroborated (such as Caprimulgidae and flamingos). The usefulness and monophyly of \\"Metaves\\" is therefore unclear. Notwithstanding, the kagu and sunbittern ‚Äì and possibly the adzebills ‚Äì seem to form a distinct Gondwanan lineage of birds, possibly one order, possibly more, even though the relationships between them, the mesites, and the \\"core Gruiformes\\" are not yet resolved. It is notable, however, that the sunbittern and the mesites possess powder down, whereas the \\"core Gruiformes\\" do not. While the kagu is the only living species in the family Rhynochetidae, a larger species, the lowland kagu (Rhynochetos orarius), has been described from late Holocene subfossil remains. The body measurements of this species were 15% greater than Rhynochetos jubatus, with no overlap in measurements except those of the wings. Given that the sites where R. orarius has been found are all lowland sites, and that no fossils of R. jubatus were found in these sites, the scientists who described the fossils suggested they represented highland and lowland species, respectively. R. orarius is one of many species to have become extinct in New Caledonia after the arrival of humans. The validity of the species has been questioned by some authors,del Hoyo, J.

Jarvis's 2014 full-genome analysis of the extant bird orders shows a distant relationship of this group to the tropicbirds, with these two groups together forming the sister group to the \\"core water birds\\", or Ardeae.

This species should not be placed in Africonus; it: synonym of Lautoconus echinophilus Significance of \\"alternative representation\\" Prior to 2009, all species within the family Conidae were placed in one genus, Conus. In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae that include the genus Africonus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are currently recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\". [P.

Using 329 species, the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results suggested that the authors should place all cone snails in a single family, Conidae, containing four genera: Conus, Conasprella, Profundiconus and Californiconus. The authors group 85% of all known cone snail species under Conus, They recognize 57 subgenera within Conus, and 11 subgenera within the genus Conasprella. References  Further reading  * Kohn A. A.

Created by game designer Gunpei Yokoi, the product derived its name from its featuring a single game as well as a clock on a LCD screen. The models from 1981 onwards featured an alarm in addition. It was the earliest Nintendo video game product to gain major success. The units are based on a 4-bit CPU, from the Sharp SM5xx family, that include a small ROM and RAM area and an LCD screen driver circuit,MAME emulator source code although, prior to its simulation in MAME, there was a misconception in that every unit used a custom ASIC instead of a proper microcontroller. The series sold a combined of 43.4 million units worldwide. Origin and design Game designer Gunpei Yokoi, while traveling on a Shinkansen, saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator by pressing the buttons. Yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time.The Escapist: Searching for Gunpei Yokoi The units use LR4x/SR4x \\"button-cell\\" batteries. Different models were manufactured, with some having two screens and a clamshell design (the Multi Screen Series). The Game Boy Advance SP, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS later reused this design.http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2010/02/feature_the_history_of_the_nintendo_game_and_watch Titles available in Game & Watch form vary from Mickey Mouse to Balloon Fight, including Nintendo staples such as Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, and Mario Bros.. The modern \\"cross\\" D-pad design was developed in 1982 by Yokoi for the Donkey Kong handheld game. The design proved to be popular for subsequent Game & Watch titles. This particular design was patented and later earned a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award. =Game A and Game B= Most of the titles have a 'GAME A' and a 'GAME B' button. Game B is generally a faster, more difficult version of Game A, although exceptions do exist, including: * In Squish, Game B is radically different from Game A ‚Äî the player must touch aliens to eliminate them as opposed to avoiding moving walls. * In Flagman, Game B is a mode where the player has to press the right button within a certain amount of time, not memorizing patterns. * In Judge, Boxing, Donkey Kong 3, and Donkey Kong Hockey, Game B is a two-player version of Game A. * In Climber, Balloon Fight, and Super Mario Bros., there is no Game B button. In most cases both Game A and Game B would increase in speed and/or difficulty as the player progressed, with Game B starting at the level that Game A would reach at 200 points.

The prize game was given to winners of Nintendo's F-1 Grand Prix tournament, a yellow-cased version of Super Mario Bros. that came in a plastic box modeled after the Disk-kun character Nintendo used to advertise their Famicom Disk System. As only 10,000 units were produced and it was never available for retail sale, the yellow version is considered rare. Mario the Juggler, released in 1991, was the last game created in the Game & Watch series. Headache, released in 1981, is the UK version of Helmet, devoid of the vulgar connotations of the word in Europe. This title is hard to find due to its region isolation and was released under CGL (UK). Headache could arguably be the rarest Game & Watch game. Judge, released in 1980, features two different colour schemes (purple and green). Releases The Game & Watch games were renewed between 1995 and 2002 with the Game & Watch Gallery series, five Game & Watch collections released for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance. They feature the original ports, as well as new, modernized versions starring the Mario series cast. From 1998 onward, a number of third-party distributors have been licensed to re-release smaller LCD versions of ten separate Game & Watch games which together compose the Nintendo Mini Classics series. In 2001, Nintendo released Manhole-e bundled with its Nintendo e-Reader systems. Although an entire line of Game & Watch e-Reader cards were planned, they were never released. Between July 2006 and March 2010, Nintendo produced two Game & Watch Collection cartridges for the Nintendo DS to be released exclusively for Club Nintendo members. The first cartridge featured three games from the Game & Watch Multi Screen series: Oil Panic, Donkey Kong, and Green House. The second compilation, Game & Watch Collection 2, contained Parachute, Octopus, and a new dual-screen game with Parachute on the top screen and Octopus on the bottom. Both cartridges are now available to the general public. Between July 2009 and April 2010 Nintendo released nine separate Game & Watch ports for DSiWare including remakes of Ball (called Game & Watch: Ball), Flagman (called Game & Watch: Flagman), Manhole (called Game & Watch: Manhole), and Mario's Cement Factory (called Game & Watch: Mario's Cement Factory) among others. In March 2010, Takara Tomy released officially licensed Game & Watch-styled keychains, based on the Wide Screen series editions of Octopus, Parachute, and Chef. They do not actually run the games, instead just display a demo screen. While the game cannot be played, the speed at which the demo runs can be adjusted. The batteries are recharged with solar panels on the unit. Ball was rereleased exclusively via Club Nintendo, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Game & Watch, with the Club Nintendo logo on the back. Unlike the original release, this version includes a mute switch. For members of the Japanese Club Nintendo, after an announcement in November 2009, it was shipped in April 2010 to Platinum members. For members of the North American Club Nintendo, it was available for 1200 coins from February 2011. For members of the European Club Nintendo, it was available for 7500 stars from November 2011. On September 3, 2020, Nintendo announced a limited run Game & Watch system containing the full NES versions of Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels (known in Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2), along with a variant of Ball with Mario's head replacing the original character's head, named Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros. It is due to release on November 13, 2020.https://gameandwatch.nintendo.com/ Legacy The Game & Watch made handheld video game consoles vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) controllers were based on the controls in Game & Watch, and Game & Watch Multi Screen version became the model on which the Nintendo DS was based. The Game & Watch Gallery series recreates the Game & Watch games in video game form, with modes that imitate the LCD displays and modes that modernise the graphics and include Mario characters. Game & Watch games have also been released through DSiWare. Nintendo Land for the Wii U has a mini-game named Octopus Dance that is based on the Game & Watch game Octopus. Game & Wario for the Wii U, a play-on-words of the Game and Watch, heavily references the Game & Watch line, including the ability to play a virtual Game & Watch version of Pyoro, called Bird. In September 2020, Nintendo announced that they would release a Super Mario Bros. Game & Watch handheld with a color LCD to celebrate the franchise's 35th anniversary. Mr. Game & Watch Mr. Game & Watch as he appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Mr. Game & Watch is a generic amalgam of black, open- mouthed, big-nosed cartoonish stick figure silhouettes from the Game & Watch games. The Mr. Game & Watch name first appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee. The character was created as an homage to the Game & Watch series, and his moveset consists of elements from many different titles; for example, his standard attack is the bug spray from Greenhouse, and his neutral special attack uses the frying pan from Chef to launch food at his opponents. The symbol of the Game & Watch series is the character ringing a bell whilst wearing a helmet, representing the alarm feature many titles contain. In the Game & Watch games themselves, the playable characters vary in appearance, as they often sport eyes, teeth and clothes, all of which Mr. Game & Watch lacks. However, in the Super Smash Bros. series, his trophies list his first appearance as \\"Game & Watch, 1980\\"; this makes him the oldest character in the series by game release date, with Pac-Man being the only other to have been introduced in 1980. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate also alters his appearance when he performs certain attacks to match how the characters look in the game of the attack's origin. After his debut, Mr. Game & Watch reappeared in subsequent Super Smash Bros. titles, as well as in Game & Watch Gallery 4, wherein he is the manager of the \\"classic games\\" area alongside Mario. He also makes a cameo appearance in Donkey Kong Country Returns in the background of level 7‚Äì1, as a worker in a foggy factory. He also appears during certain stages in Rhythm Heaven Fever. Mr. Game & Watch is never heard speaking in the Super Smash Bros. series. Instead, he emits beeping noises similar to those heard while playing the Game & Watch games, although he does have speech balloons in Game & Watch Gallery 4. His other distinct traits include being paper-thin due to having only two dimensions (although he is actually a 3D model flattened for this effect) and thus not possessing depth, which is translated to him being a lightweight character within the Super Smash Bros. series, as well as limited/choppy animations. These traits allude to the graphical limitations of the Game & Watch games. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the game's story mode, The Subspace Emissary, suggests Mr. Game & Watch is made of a primordial substance that can take on any number of forms. Mr. Game & Watch was harvested for this reason to create the Subspace Army.Shadow Bugs - Trophy Description. Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Nintendo. 2008 As claimed by the Smash Bros. DOJO!!, the official website for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mr. Game & Watch allowed this to happen because he has no concept of good and evil.

Later in World War II (1943), the TDC Mk III was replaced by the TDC Mk IV, which was an improved and larger version of the Mk III. The Torpedo Data Computer (TDC) was an early electromechanical analog computer used for torpedo fire-control on American submarines during World War II. Britain, Germany, and Japan also developed automated torpedo fire control equipment, but none were as advanced as the US Navy's TDC, as it was able to automatically track the target rather than simply offering an instantaneous firing solution. This unique capability of the TDC set the standard for submarine torpedo fire control during World War II. While the TDC's target tracking abilities were unique for submarine torpedo fire control during WWII, target tracking was used on surface ship torpedo fire control systems by a number of nations (see references in this article to US destroyer and Japanese torpedo fire control ). The TDC was the first analog computer to miniaturize the capability enough for deployment on a submarine. Replacing the previously standard hand-held slide rule-type devices (known as the \\"banjo\\" & \\"is/was\\"),Beach, Run Silent, Run Deep the TDC was designed to provide fire- control solutions for submarine torpedo firing against ships running on the surface (surface warships used a different computer).http://www.maritime.org/doc/destroyer/ddfc/index.htm The TDC was a rather bulky addition to the sub's conning tower and required two extra crewmen: one as an expert in its maintenance, the other as its actual operator. Despite these drawbacks, the use of the TDC was an important factor in the successful commerce raiding program conducted by American submarines during the Pacific campaign of World War II. Accounts of the American submarine campaign in the Pacific often cite the use of TDC.; Beach, Edward L., Jr., Captain, USN (rtd). Run Silent, Run Deep, passim; Beach, Dust on the Sea, passim; Grider, George. War Fish, passim; Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (New York: Bantam, 1976), passim. Some officers became highly skilled in its use,Dusty Dornin was widely agreed to be the best. Blair, p.357. and the Navy set up a training school for its use.Blair, p.357. Two upgraded World War II- era U.S. Navy fleet submarines ( and ) with their TDCs continue to serve with Taiwan's navy and U.S. Nautical Museum staff are assisting them with maintaining their equipment. The museum also has a fully restored and functioning TDC from , docked in San Francisco. Background =History= The problem of aiming a torpedo has occupied military engineers since Robert Whitehead developed the modern torpedo in the 1860s. These early torpedoes ran at a preset depth on a straight course (consequently they are frequently referred to as \\"straight runners\\"). This was the state of the art in torpedo guidance until the development of the homing torpedo during the latter part of World War II.There were other forms of torpedo guidance attempted throughout WWII. Notable are the Japanese human-guided Kaiten and German pattern running and acoustic homing types for attacking convoys. Today, most submarine- launched torpedoes are wire-guided with terminal homing. The vast majority of submarine torpedoes during World War II were straight running and these continued in use for many years after World War II. In fact, two World War II- era straight running torpedoes ‚Äî fired by the British nuclear-powered submarine ‚Äî sank the ARA General Belgrano in 1982. During World War I, computing a target intercept course for a torpedo was a manual process where the fire control party was aided by various slide rules (the U.S. examples were the Mark VIII Angle Solver (colloquially called the \\"banjo\\", for its shape), and the \\"Is/Was\\" circular sliderule (Nasmith Director), for predicting where a target will be based on where it is now and was)Holwitt, Joel I. \\"Execute Against Japan\\", Ph.D. dissertation, Ohio State University, 2005, p.147; Beach, Edward L., Jr. Run Silent, Run Deep. or mechanical calculator/sights. These were often \\"woefully inaccurate\\",Holwitt, p. 147. which helps explain why torpedo spreads were advised. During World War II, Germany, Japan,Britain and the United States each developed analog computers to automate the process of computing the required torpedo course. In 1932, the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) initiated development of the TDC with Arma Corporation and Ford Instruments.Holwitt, p.147. This culminated in the \\"very complicated\\" Mark 1 in 1938. This was retrofitted into older boats, beginning with Dolphin and up through the newest Salmons. The first submarine designed to use the TDC was , launched in 1940 with the Mark III, located in the conning tower. (This differed from earlier outfits.)Beach, Edward L., Jr. Dust on the Sea. It proved to be the best torpedo fire control system of World War II.Holwitt, p.147; . In 1943, the Torpedo Data Computer Mark IV was developed to support the Mark 18 torpedo.The Mark 18 was electric and therefore wakeless and difficult for surface forces to trace. On the downside, it was slower than the Mark 14. This made it more difficult to aim accurately because larger gyro angles were involved. Even so, thousands of them were fired during WWII. Both the Mk III and Mk IV TDC were developed by Arma Corporation (now American Bosch Arma). =The problem of aiming a straight-running torpedo= Figure 2: Illustration of general torpedo fire-control problem A straight-running torpedo has a gyroscope-based control system that ensures that the torpedo will run a straight course.Straight after an initial turn to course, as explained below. The torpedo can run on a course different from that of the submarine by adjusting a parameter called the gyro angle, which sets the course of the torpedo relative to the course of the submarine (see Figure 2). The primary role of the TDC is to determine the gyro angle setting required to ensure that the torpedo will strike the target. Determining the gyro angle required the real-time solution of a complex trigonometric equation (see Equation 1 for a simplified example). The TDC provided a continuous solution to this equation using data updates from the submarine's navigation sensors and the TDC's target tracker. The TDC was also able to automatically update all torpedo gyro angle settings simultaneously with a fire control solution, which improved the accuracy over systems that required manual updating of the torpedo's course. The TDC enables the submarine to launch the torpedo on a course different from that of the submarine, which is important tactically. Otherwise the submarine would need to be pointed at the projected intercept point in order to launch a torpedo.Torpedoes were developed by the United States with this capability during WWI. However, without automated fire control it was difficult to realize the full advantages of this approach. Requiring the entire vessel to be pointed in order to launch a torpedo would be time consuming, require precise submarine course control, and would needlessly complicate the torpedo firing process. The TDC with target tracking gives the submarine the ability to maneuver independently of the required target intercept course for the torpedo. As is shown in Figure 2, in general, the torpedo does not actually move in a straight path immediately after launch and it does not instantly accelerate to full speed, which are referred to as torpedo ballistic characteristics. The ballistic characteristics are described by three parameters: reach, turning radius, and corrected torpedo speed. Also, the target bearing angle is different from the point of view of the periscope versus the point of view of the torpedo, which is referred to as torpedo tube parallax. These factors are a significant complication in the calculation of the gyro angle and the TDC must compensate for their effects. Straight running torpedoes were usually launched in salvo (i.e. multiple launches in a short period of time) or a spread (i.e. multiple launches with slight angle offsets) to increase the probability of striking the target given the inaccuracies present in the measurement of angles, target range, target speed, torpedo track angle, and torpedo speed. Salvos and spreads were also launched to strike tough targets multiple times to ensure their destruction. The TDC supported the firing of torpedo salvos by allowing short time offsets between firings and torpedo spreads by adding small angle offsets to each torpedo's gyro angle. Before the sinking of South Korea's ROKS Cheonan by North Korea in 2010, the last warship sunk by a submarine torpedo attack, the ARA General Belgrano in 1982, was struck by two torpedoes from a three torpedo spread. A look inside the TDC showing the motors driving the Position Keeper. To accurately compute the gyro angle for a torpedo in a general engagement scenario, the target course, speed, range, and bearing must be accurately known. During World War II, target course, range, and bearing estimates often had to be generated using periscope observations, which were highly subjective and error prone. The TDC was used to refine the estimates of the target's course, range, and bearing through a process of *estimating the target's course, speed, and range based on observations. *using the TDC to predict the target's position at a future time based on the estimates of the target's course, speed, and range. *comparing the predicted position against the actual position and correcting the estimated parameters as required to achieve agreement between the predictions and observation. Agreement between prediction and observation means that the target course, speed, and range estimates are accurate. Estimating the target's course was generally considered the most difficult of the observation tasks. The accuracy of the result was highly dependent on the experience of the skipper. During combat, the actual course of the target was not usually determined but instead the skippers determined a related quantity called \\"angle on the bow.\\" Angle on the bow is the angle formed by the target course and the line of sight to the submarine. Some skippers, like Richard O'Kane, practiced determining the angle on the bow by looking at IJN ship models mounted on a calibrated lazy Susan through an inverted binocular barrel. To generate target position data versus time, the TDC needed to solve the equations of motion for the target relative to the submarine. The equations of motion are differential equations and the TDC used mechanical integrators to generate its solution. The TDC needed to be positioned near other fire control equipment to minimize the amount of electromechanical interconnect. Because submarine space within the pressure hull was limited, the TDC needed to be as small as possible. On World War II submarines, the TDC and other fire control equipment was mounted in the conning tower, which was a very small space. The packaging problem was severe and the performance of some early torpedo fire control equipment was hampered by the need to make it small. It had an array of handcranks, dials, and switches for data input and display.http://www.fleetsubmarine.com/tdc.html To generate a fire control solution, it required inputs on *submarine course and speed, which were read automatically from the submarine's gyrocompass and pitometer log *estimated target course, speed, and range information (obtained using data from the submarine's periscope, Target Bearing Transmitter (TBT), radar, and sonar) *torpedo type and speed (type was needed to deal with the different torpedo ballistics) The TDC performed the trigonometric calculations required to compute a target intercept course for the torpedo. It also had an electromechanical interface to the torpedoes, allowing it to automatically set courses while torpedoes were still in their tubes, ready to be fired. The TDC's target tracking capability was used by the fire control party to continuously update the fire control solution even while the submarine was maneuvering. The TDC's target tracking ability also allowed the submarine to accurately fire torpedoes even when the target was temporarily obscured by smoke or fog. =TDC functional description= Since the TDC actually performed two separate functions, generating target position estimates and computing torpedo firing angles, the TDC actually consisted of two types of analog computers: *Angle solver: This computer calculates the required gyro angle. The TDC had separate angle solvers for the forward and aft torpedo tubes. *Position keeper: This computer generates a continuously updated estimate of the target position based on earlier target position measurements. Angle solver The equations implemented in the angle solver can be found in the Torpedo Data Computer manual. The Submarine Torpedo Fire Control Manual discusses the calculations in a general sense and a greatly abbreviated form of that discussion is presented here. The general torpedo fire control problem is illustrated in Figure 2. The problem is made more tractable if we assume: *The periscope is on the line formed by the torpedo running along its course *The target moves on a fixed course and speed *The torpedo moves on a fixed course and speed Figure 3: The torpedo fire control triangle As can be seen in Figure 2, these assumptions are not true in general because of the torpedo ballistic characteristics and torpedo tube parallax. Providing the details as to how to correct the torpedo gyro angle calculation for ballistics and parallax is complicated and beyond the scope of this article. Most discussions of gyro angle determination take the simpler approach of using Figure 3, which is called the torpedo fire control triangle. Figure 3 provides an accurate model for computing the gyro angle when the gyro angle is small, usually less than 30¬∞. The effects of parallax and ballistics are minimal for small gyro angle launches because the course deviations they cause are usually small enough to be ignorable. U.S. submarines during World War II preferred to fire their torpedoes at small gyro angles because the TDC's fire control solutions were most accurate for small angles. The problem of computing the gyro angle setting is a trigonometry problem that is simplified by first considering the calculation of the deflection angle, which ignores torpedo ballistics and parallax. For small gyro angles, . A direct application of the law of sines to Figure 3 produces Equation . \\\\right \\\\ }{ \\\\sin(\\\\theta_{\\\\mathrm{Deflection}}) } = \\\\frac{\\\\left \\\\Vert v_{\\\\mathrm{Torpedo}} \\\\right \\\\ }{ \\\\sin(\\\\theta_{\\\\mathrm{Bow}}) } }} where : is the velocity of the target. : is the velocity of the torpedo. : is the angle of the target ship bow relative to the periscope line of sight. : is the angle of the torpedo course relative to the periscope line of sight. Range plays no role in Equation , which is true as long as the three assumptions are met. In fact, Equation is the same equation solved by the mechanical sights of steerable torpedo tubes used on surface ships during World War I and World War II. Torpedo launches from steerable torpedo tubes meet the three stated assumptions well. However, an accurate torpedo launch from a submarine requires parallax and torpedo ballistic corrections when gyro angles are large. These corrections require knowing range accurately. When the target range was not known, torpedo launches requiring large gyro angles were not recommended. Equation is frequently modified to substitute track angle for deflection angle (track angle is defined in Figure 2, ). This modification is illustrated with Equation . \\\\right \\\\ }{ \\\\sin(\\\\theta_{\\\\mathrm{Deflection}}) } = \\\\frac{\\\\left \\\\Vert v_{\\\\mathrm{Torpedo}} \\\\right \\\\ }{ \\\\sin(\\\\theta_{\\\\mathrm{Track}}-\\\\theta_{\\\\mathrm{Deflection}})}}} where is the angle between the target ship's course and the torpedo's course. Figure 4: Deflection angle versus track angle and target speed (). A number of publications state the optimum torpedo track angle as 110¬∞ for a Mk 14 (46 knot weapon). Figure 4 shows a plot of the deflection angle versus track angle when the gyro angle is 0¬∞ (i.e., ).Most work on computing intercept angles is done using track angle as a variable. This is because track angle is a strictly a function of the target's course and speed along with the torpedo's course and speed. It removes the complexities associated with parallax and torpedo ballistics. Optimum track angle is defined as the point of minimum deflection angle sensitivity to track angle errors for a given target speed. This minimum occurs at the points of zero slope on the curves in Figure 4 (these points are marked by small triangles). The curves show the solutions of Equation for deflection angle as a function of target speed and track angle. Figure 4 confirms that 110¬∞ is the optimum track angle for a target, which would be a common ship speed. There is fairly complete documentation available for a Japanese torpedo fire control computer that goes through the details of correcting for the ballistic and parallax factors. While the TDC may not have used exactly the same approach, it was likely very similar. Position keeper As with the angle solver the equations implemented in the angle solver can be found in the Torpedo Data Computer manual. Similar functions were implemented in the rangekeepers for surface ship-based fire control systems. For a general discussion of the principles behind the position keeper, see Rangekeeper.

History TheSpark.com was a literary website launched by four Harvard students on January 7, 1999. Most of TheSpark's users were high school and college students. To increase the site's popularity, the creators published the first six literature study guides (called \\"SparkNotes\\") on April 7, 1999. In 2000, the creators sold the site to iTurf Inc. The following year, Barnes & Noble purchased SparkNotes and selected fifty literature study guides to publish in print format. When Barnes & Noble printed SparkNotes, they stopped selling their chief competitor, CliffsNotes. In January 2003, SparkNotes developed a practice test service called SparkNotes Test Prep. This project was followed by the release of SparkCharts, reference sheets that summarize a topic; No Fear Shakespeare, transcriptions of Shakespeare's plays into modern language; and No Fear Literature, transcriptions of literary classics like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Scarlet Letter into modern language.

These teachers argue that students can use SparkNotes as a replacement for actually completing reading assignments with the original material or to cheat during tests using cell phones with Internet access. SparkNotes states that it does not support academic dishonesty or plagiarism. Instead, it suggests that students read the original material, and then check SparkNotes to compare their own interpretation of the text with the SparkNotes analysis. In January 2019, site developers announced a complete redesign of the SparkLife section of the website in order to focus more on literature-related content. This announcement was met with a negative response from SparkLife users due to the removal of user-made accounts, blog posts, and comments.

His rivalry with Richard, Duke of York was a leading cause of the Wars of the Roses. Origins Edmund Beaufort was the third surviving son of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the eldest of the four legitimised children of John of Gaunt (1340-1399) (third surviving son of King Edward III) by his mistress Katherine Swynford. Edmund's mother was Margaret Holland, a daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent by his wife Alice FitzAlan, a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel by his wife Eleanor of Lancaster, 5th daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, a grandson of King Henry III. Edmund was thus a cousin of both Richard, Duke of York, and the Lancastrian King Henry VI. Career Although he was the head of one of the greatest families in England, his inheritance was worth only 300 pounds. By contrast his rival, Richard, Duke of York, had a net worth of 5,800 pounds. His cousin King Henry VI's efforts to compensate Somerset with offices worth 3,000 pounds only served to offend many of the nobles and as his quarrel with York grew more personal, the dynastic situation got worse. Another quarrel with the Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick over the lordships of Glamorgan and Morgannwg may have forced the leader of the younger Nevilles into York's camp. His brothers were taken captive at the Battle of Baug√© in 1421, but Edmund was too young at the time to fight. He acquired much military experience while his brothers were prisoners. =Affair with Catherine of Valois= In 1427 it is believed that Edmund Beaufort may have embarked on an affair with Catherine of Valois, the widow of King Henry V. Evidence is sketchy, however the liaison prompted a parliamentary statute regulating the remarriage of queens of England. The historian G. L. Harriss surmised that it was possible that another of its consequences was Catherine's son Edmund Tudor and that Catherine, to avoid the penalties of breaking the statute of 1427‚Äì8, secretly married Owen Tudor. He wrote: \\"By its very nature the evidence for Edmund Tudor's parentage is less than conclusive, but such facts as can be assembled permit the agreeable possibility that Edmund 'Tudor' and Margaret Beaufort were first cousins and that the royal house of 'Tudor' sprang in fact from Beauforts on both sides.\\" =Political power and conflict= Charles VII at Rouen in 1449. Illuminated page from the Anciennes chroniques d'Angleterre, Jean de Wavrin., the start of Chapter 3 of Volume 6 Edmund received the county of Mortain in Normandy on 22 April 1427. Edmund became a commander in the English army in 1431, and in 1432 was one of the envoys to the Council of Basel. After his recapture of Harfleur and his lifting of the Burgundian siege of Calais, he was named a Knight of the Garter in 1436. After subsequent successes he was created Earl of Dorset on 28 August 1442 (though he seems to have been styled as such since around 1438) and Marquess of Dorset on 24 June 1443. During the five-year truce from 1444 to 1449 he served as Lieutenant of France. On 31 March 1448 he was created Duke of Somerset. As the title had previously been held by his brother, he is sometimes mistakenly called the second duke,Humphrys Family Tree but the title was actually created for the second time, and so he was actually the first duke, the numbering starting over again. Somerset was appointed to replace York as commander in France in 1448. Fighting began in Normandy in August 1449. Somerset's subsequent military failures left him vulnerable to criticism from York's allies. Somerset was supposed to be paid ¬£20,000; but little evidence exists that he was. He failed to repulse French attacks, and by the summer of 1450 nearly all the English possessions in northern France were lost, with Normandy having fallen after the Battle of Formigny and Siege of Caen. By 1453 all the English possessions in the south of France were also lost, and the Battle of Castillon ended the Hundred Years War. The fall of the duke of Suffolk left Somerset the chief of the king's ministers, and the Commons in vain petitioned for his removal in January 1451. Power rested with Somerset and he virtually monopolised it, with Margaret of Anjou, wife of Henry VI, as one of his principal allies. It was also widely suspected that Edmund had an extra-marital affair with Margaret. After giving birth to a son in October 1453, Margaret took great pains to quash rumours that Somerset might be his father. During her pregnancy, Henry had suffered a mental breakdown, leaving him in a withdrawn and unresponsive state that lasted for one and a half years. This medical condition, untreatable either by court physicians or by exorcism, plagued him throughout his life. During Henry's illness, the child was baptised Edward, Prince of Wales, with Somerset as godfather; if the King could be persuaded, he would become legal heir to the throne. Somerset's fortunes, however, soon changed when his rival York assumed power as Lord Protector in April 1454 and imprisoned him in the Tower of London. Somerset's life was probably saved only by the King's seeming recovery late in 1454, which forced York to surrender his office. Henry agreed to recognise Edward as his heir, putting to rest concerns about a successor prompted by his known aversion to physical contact; subsequently he came to view Edward's birth as a miracle., Chapter 3., Chapter 3. Somerset was honourably discharged, and restored to his office as Captain of Calais. By now York was determined to depose Somerset by one means or another, and in May 1455 he raised an army. He confronted Somerset and the King in an engagement known as the First Battle of St Albans which marked the beginning of the Wars of the Roses. Somerset was killed in a last wild charge from the house where he had been sheltering. His son, Henry, never forgave York and Warwick for his father's death, and he spent the next nine years attempting to restore his family's honour. Marriage & issue At sometime between 1431 and 1433 he married Eleanor Beauchamp, daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick by his first wife Elizabeth de Berkeley, daughter and heiress of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley. Eleanor was an elder half-sister of Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick and Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick, wife of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, \\"The Kingmaker\\". The marriage was without royal licence, which offence was pardoned on 7 March 1438.

He himself refuted any familial relationship with his contemporary the great Admiral Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540 ‚Äì 1596), as their dispute concerning armorials reveals. Origin He was the eldest son of John Drake (d. 1558) of Ash, by his wife Amy Grenville (d. 1578/9),Vivian, Visitations of the County of Devon, p. 293 a daughter of Sir Roger Grenville (1477‚Äì1523), lord of the manor of Bideford in Devon and of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton, Cornwall, Sheriff of Cornwall in 1510‚Äì11, 1517‚Äì18, 1522, and present within the Cornish contingent at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1981, vol.1, p. 303 His brother was Richard Drake (1535‚Äì1603) of Esher, an Equerry of the Stable and Groom of the Privy Chamber to Queen Elizabeth I and a Member of Parliament. His uncle was Richard Grenville (died 1550). Sir Bernard's aunt, Alice Drake, married Walter Raleigh and became the step-mother of Sir Walter Raleigh, the explorer and poet. Voyages His life was uneventful until he became associated with Sir Humphrey Gilbert, perhaps through his relatives Richard Grenville and Walter Raleigh. Thus Bernard was first attracted to American ventures and, in December 1582, he was among the adventurers in a corporation established by Gilbert to exploit his royal grant in North America, although Drake's involvement seems to have been limited to his investment; Drake undertook to lead a party of adventurers to settle whatever part of North America Gilbert had sold him on paper. He did not participate in any overseas ventures, however, so far as is known, until 1585, by which time he had joined with Raleigh and Humphrey Gilbert's brother, John, in activities connected with the Roanoke Island Colony, in present-day North Carolina. When, on 26 May, the Spanish government placed an embargo on English shipping in Bilbao harbour, Raleigh commissioned Drake to warn English fishermen in Newfoundland of the embargo and to seize Spanish shipping. Dropping plans for a privateering voyage to the West Indies en route for Roanoke, where a colony was to be settled by Sir Richard Grenville who had left Plymouth in April, Drake left for Newfoundland in July. =Newfoundland= Drake's successful voyage began by taking a ship bound from Brazil to Portugal with a load of sugar. Alerting the British Newfoundland fishermen that their primary markets of Spain were now off-limits, he took several Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels, detaching some of his own vessels to take them to England as prizes. Teaming up with Raleigh-associate George Raymond, he took several Spanish traders around the Azores carrying sugar, wine and ivory, as well as a French vessel bearing gold. The total takings of the expedition, about 20 ships, represented a profit estimated at 600%, from which as his share Drake and his son John received the four most valuable ships. Equally important, the voyage had deprived the Spanish navy and merchant marine of the dried fish on which they relied for their own voyages, leading the Spanish government to forbid ships from sailing to Newfoundland, while the Portuguese fishing fleet was permanently hobbled by their losses to Drake.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Marriage and progeny At an unknown date, Drake married Gertrude Fortescue, a daughter of Bartholomew Fortescue (d. 1557) of Filleigh, North Devon, and sister of Richard Fortescue (d. 1570) of Filleigh (ancestor of the Earls Fortescue) in whose memory he erected a monumental brass in Filleigh Church. Gertrude's mother was Ellen Moore, a daughter of Morris Moore (1459‚Äì1500)Vivian, Visitations of the County of Devon, pp. 353, 572 of Moor Hayes in the parish of Cullompton in Devon, by his wife Cecily Bonville, a daughter of John Bonville, base son of William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville.Vivian, Visitations of the County of Devon, p. 572, pedigree of Moore By his wife he had six children: * Hugh Drake (d. 1589), who died in Portugal in 1589, without progeny; * John Drake (died 1628), of Mount Drake and Ashe, who married Dorothy Button (d. 1631), a daughter of William Button of Aston, Wiltshire; their son, Sir John Drake (d. 1636) of Ashe, married Eleanor Boteler, a daughter of John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Brantfield, and was the maternal grandfather of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough; * Marie Drake, who married Tynsley of Lincolnshire; * Mary Drake, who married John Sherman, of Knightstone, Ottery St. Mary, Devon; their daughter Alice Drake married Richard Percivale and was ancestress of the Earls of Egmont; * Eleanor Drake, who married John Button of Wiltshire. Death and burial On 9 January 1586, Bernard Drake was knighted by Elizabeth I at Greenwich in recognition of his success. A couple of months later, the surviving Portuguese prisoners, whom Drake had had imprisoned in Exeter Castle, were put on trial, the charge perhaps being mutiny. Those who lived came to trial at the notorious Lent Black Assize of Exeter from 14 March 1586 held at Exeter Castle. The prisoners were so weak and ill that Drake was reprimanded by the judge, Edward Flowerdew (died 1586), Baron of the Exchequer, for his neglect. Within little more than three weeks, the judge, eleven of the twelve jurors and eight justices of the peace, who had been exposed to the prisoners, died from an infection caught from the Portuguese. Ill himself, Drake tried to reach home but died in Crediton on 10 April 1586, and was buried two days later. For more than a year an epidemic of what was apparently typhus raged in Devonshire. Drake's son, John, inherited Ashe as well as the profits of the Newfoundland voyage. Monument John VII Drake (d. 1628), who erected the monument in 1611, son of Sir Bernard, with his wife Dorothy Button (d. 1631). Also shown four times are the arms of Drake: Argent, a wyvern wings displayed and tail nowed gules. Gilded inscribed biographical tablets appear under each couple of kneeling figures A monument was erected by his son, John, in St. Michael's Church, Musbury, which shows three generations of family patriarchs at prayer, each kneeling with his wife. The inscription under the middle couple, being Sir Bernard and his wife, is as follows:The Drake Monument > \\"Heer is the monument of Sr Barnard Drake Kt. who had to wife Dame Garthrud > the daughter of Bartholomew Fortescue of Filly Esqr. by whom hee had three > sonnes and thre daughters where of whear five living at his death viz John, > Hugh, Marie, Margaret and Helen. He died the Xth of April 1586 and Dame > Garthrud his wief was here bured the XIIth of Februarie 1601 unto the > memorie of whome John Drake Esqr. his sonne hath set this monument Anno > 1611\\" Armorials The armorials of the ancient family of Drake of Ash, Argent, a wyvern gules, can be seen on the monument to Sir Bernard erected at Musbury Church in 1611. Sir Francis Drake, the great sea-captain, was a very distant relation to Sir Bernard, when knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1581 assumed the arms of Drake of Ash, which action was contested by Sir Bernard, as the anecdote recorded by John Swete (d. 1821), noted by him from John Prince's \\"Worthies of Devon\\" (1697), relates:Swete, Rev. John, Travels in Georgian Devon, Ed. Gray, T. & Rowe, M., Vol.2, Tiverton, 1998, p. 122 > \\"By the assumption of the arms of the family of Ash, Sir Francis Drake > incurr'd the displeasure of Sir Bernard, insomuch that Sir Francis receiv'd > from the indignant knight a box on the ear, and that even within the > precinct of the court. The Queen was of too haughty a spirit to permit such > an outrage to pass unpunish'd and not only reprehended Sir Bernard but as a > check to the pride of the one and as what was due to the merit of the other, > bestow'd on Sir Francis a new coat of arms allusive to his having > circumnavigated the world: Diamond, a fess wavy between two pole stars > Arctic and Antarctic pearl and a crest: A ship on a globe under ruff held by > a cable rope with a hand out of the clouds in the rigging whereof is hung up > by the heels a wivern gules, tha arms of Sir Bernard, which indignity the > knight bore as well as he might, observing that though Her Majesty might > give Sir Francis a nobler, yet she could not give an antienter coat than > his.\\" Sir Francis, regardless of Sir Bernard's protest, nevertheless proceeded to adopt the arms of Drake of Ash, as he sealed several documents with the wyvern arms quartered with the new coat.

Ilarion Ciobanu played Commissioner Roman in all five films, and Sergiu Nicolaescu directed the first two. The films were: *With Clean Hands (), 1972 *The Last Bullet (), 1973 *Conspiracy (), 1973 *Long Way to Tipperary (), 1973 *Trap (), 1974 The first film of the series, With Clean Hands takes place in 1945-1946 and introduces Mihai Roman as a rookie detective. Roman is a dedicated communist and former member of the communist underground, and his joining the force is part of the communist infiltration of the government apparatus (which is presented positively). The earnest, by-the-book Roman teams with the more unorthodox (and apolitical) Tudor Miclovan (played by Sergiu Nicolaescu himself) to clean up organized crime in post-war Bucharest. Miclovan is killed at the end (\\"It's nothing... I'm finished, but Romania continues...\\"). In the next film in the series, The Last Bullet, Roman hunts downs Miclovan's killer, a local gangster and smuggler named Semaca. Roman carries Miclovan's last cartridge in his pocket, hence the movie's title. Roman also catches a German spy who is still hiding in Romania. Audience demand for a revival of Miclovan was refused by screenwriter Titus Popovici, which led to strained relations between Popovici and director Nicolaescu. The next three films in the series were directed by Manole Marcus. In Conspiracy, Roman thwarts election fraud. Long Way to Tipperary is based on the historical TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair; Roman tracks traitors plotting to flee the country to set up a government in exile, and arrests them at the airport. In Trap, the final film of the series, Roman deals with an anti-communist gang entrenched in the Carpathian Mountains. In this film, Roman is seriously wounded but does not die. The film shows details of Orthodox monastic life, as the gang poses as monks. This film was shown in the Soviet Union.

National Forest Culture Collection This is an internationally registered living collection of almost 3000 fungal specimens (including some bacteria and lichens) stored in culture. Some pathogenic (disease causing) fungi from overseas are stored in a containment facility. National Forest Mycological Herbarium This internationally registered collection comprises almost 2000 dried fungal specimens and plant material containing fungi. The earliest collections date back to the late 1800s from Sweden. National Forestry Herbarium and Database The herbarium contains plants significant to plantation and indigenous forestry in New Zealand, including a wide range of native and amenity species.

This collection can be used to compare samples with unknown timbers. Permanent Sample Plots database Scion's Permanent Sample Plot (PSP) system is a comprehensive database of forest growth data that underpins New Zealand's commercial forest industry. The system contains information about the effect factors such as environment, genetics and silviculture regimes have on the growth of stands and trees. The PSP system holds data from the 1920s, and has been in a digital format since the early 1960s. The digital platform is a flexible relational database that holds different types of forest data for both experimental research and commercial growth plots. These data are sourced from permanent sample plots that have been established, and regularly measured, in different forest types throughout New Zealand. In 2017, the system holds data from 32,000 PSPs of which 11,500 are current and 20,500 historic records. The PSP system is one of the most extensive data resources on tree growth, internationally.4 Scientists and forest companies use this information to understand how current forests are performing, and how future forests might grow under different conditions. These data support important forest management decisions.  Scion Nursery  The 10 hectare nursery in Rotorua has shade houses, controlled climate propagation facilities, commercial bare-root operations and a large purpose-built container-growing operation. The facility can on-grow 700,000 seedlings a year and is used for both research and commercial sales.

History  Scion is the trading name for New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited. The head office and main campus is in Rotorua on a site that was once the headquarters for a forest nursery for a large government afforestation programme. The nursery was established in 1898 at the edge of Whakarewarewa Forest where more than 60 exotic species were planted on 5000 hectares to determine which species grew best in New Zealand conditions. Research commenced on the campus in 1947 as a government-owned Forest Experiment Station. In 1949 it was renamed the Forest Research Institute (FRI) under the auspices of the New Zealand Forest Service. In 1992 it was established as one of New Zealand's Crown Research Institutes (CRI) as part of the government of the day's science restructuring. In 2005 the trading name Scion was adopted.

Crustal recycling is a tectonic process by which surface material from the lithosphere is recycled into the mantle by subduction erosion or delamination. The subducting slabs carry volatile compounds and water into the mantle, as well as crustal material with an isotopic signature different from that of primitive mantle. Identification of this crustal signature in mantle-derived rocks (such as mid-ocean ridge basalts or kimberlites) is proof of crustal recycling. Historical and theoretical context Between 1906 and 1936 seismological data were used by R.D. Oldham, A. Mohoroviƒçiƒá, B. Gutenberg and I. Lehmann to show that the earth consisted of a solid crust and mantle, a fluid outer core and a solid innermost core. The development of seismology as a modern tool for imaging the Earth's deep interior occurred during the 1980s, and with it developed two camps of geologists: whole-mantle convection proponents and layered-mantle convection proponents. Layered-mantle convection proponents hold that the mantle's convective activity is layered, separated by densest-packing phase transitions of minerals like olivine, garnet and pyroxene to more dense crystal structures (spinel and then silicate perovskite and post-perovskite). Slabs that are subducted may be negatively buoyant as a result of being cold from their time on the surface and inundation with water, but this negative buoyancy is not enough to move through the 660-km phase transition. Whole- mantle (simple) convection proponents hold that the mantle‚Äôs observed density differences (which are inferred to be products of mineral phase transitions) do not restrict convective motion, which moves through the upper and lower mantle as a single convective cell. Subducting slabs are able to move through the 660-km phase transition and collect near the bottom of the mantle in a 'slab graveyard', and may be the driving force for convection in the mantle locally and on a crustal scale. The fate of subducted material The ultimate fate of crustal material is key to understanding geochemical cycling, as well as persistent heterogeneities in the mantle, upwelling and myriad effects on magma composition, melting, plate tectonics, mantle dynamics and heat flow. If slabs are stalled out at the 660-km boundary, as the layered- mantle hypothesis suggests, they cannot be incorporated into hot spot plumes, thought to originate at the core-mantle boundary. If slabs end up in a \\"slab graveyard\\" at the core-mantle boundary, they cannot be involved in flat slab subduction geometry. Mantle dynamics is likely a mix of the two end-member hypotheses, resulting in a partially layered mantle convection system. Our current understanding of the structure of the deep Earth is informed mostly by inference from direct and indirect measurements of mantle properties using seismology, petrology, isotope geochemistry and seismic tomography techniques. Seismology in particular is heavily relied upon for information about the deep mantle near the core-mantle boundary. Evidence =Seismic tomography= Although seismic tomography was producing low-quality images of the Earth's mantle in the 1980s, images published in a 1997 editorial article in the journal Science clearly showed a cool slab near the core-mantle boundary, as did work completed in 2005 by Hutko et al., showing a seismic tomography image that may be cold, folded slab material at the core-mantle boundary. However, the phase transitions may still play a role in the behavior of slabs at depth. Schellart et al. showed that the 660-km phase transition may serve to deflect downgoing slabs. The shape of the subduction zone was also key in whether the geometry of the slab could overcome the phase transition boundary. Mineralogy may also play a role, as locally metastable olivine will form areas of positive buoyancy, even in a cold downgoing slab, and this could cause slabs to 'stall out' at the increased density of the 660-km phase transition. Slab mineralogy and its evolution at depth were not initially computed with information about the heating rate of a slab, which could prove essential to helping maintain negative buoyancy long enough to pierce the 660 km phase change. Additional work completed by Spasojevic et al. showed that local minima in the geoid could be accounted for by the processes that occur in and around slab graveyards, as indicated in their models. =Stable isotopes= Understanding that the differences between Earth's layers are not just rheological, but chemical, is essential to understanding how we can track the movement of crustal material even after it has been subducted. After a rock has moved to the surface of the earth from beneath the crust, that rock can be sampled for its stable isotopic composition. It can then be compared to known crustal and mantle isotopic compositions, as well as that of chondrites, which are understood to represent original material from the formation of the solar system in a largely unaltered state. One group of researchers was able to estimate that between 5 and 10% of the upper mantle is composed of recycled crustal material. Kokfelt et al. completed an isotopic examination of the mantle plume under Iceland and found that erupted mantle lavas incorporated lower crustal components, confirming crustal recycling at the local level. Some carbonatite units, which are associated with immiscible volatile-rich magmas and the mantle indicator mineral diamond, have shown isotopic signals for organic carbon, which could only have been introduced by subducted organic material. The work done on carbonatites by Walter et al. and others further develops the magmas at depth as being derived from dewatering slab material.

The Left Front led State Government deployed the army in the afternoon of that day.  Background  On 17 August, Muslim clerics in Kolkata issued death warrant against Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen.  Events  Several media persons from television channels were hurt due to stone pelting. The rioters set fire to two party offices of the ruling party Communist Party of India (Marxist). The violence led to severe traffic snarls during the morning rush hour. Most of the violence was concentrated in the Muslim Majority neighbourhoods of Central and East Kolkata. Park Circus Area, Topsia, Tiljala, Tangra, Park Street- MullickBazar, Eliot Road, Ripon Street, Royd Street, Colin Street, Marquis Street, Raja Bazar, Sealdah, Moulali, C.I.T.Road and adjoining areas of John Burdon Sanderson Haldane Avenue (Park Circus Connector). North and South Kolkata were largely peaceful and curfew was not extended to those areas. As the streets of Kolkata turned into a combat zone, the State Government requisitioned ten platoons of the army. At 3 PM, four platoons of the army, each comprising 100 to 120 soldiers marched into the city from Fort William. 3 flag marches were conducted that evening. Four more platoons were preparing to move soon. Idris Ali of the Minority Forum was the mastermind. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Zone) Meeraj Khalid opened fire on a group of arsonists at Eliot Road. In total 6 rounds were fired and 3 people were grievously injured. Brigadier Solanki imposed martial law at 4 pm. The curfew was strictly enforced. Withdrawal of curfew was done in a phased manner the following day after Governor Gopalakrishna Gandhi met top communist and opposition leaders. The Home Ministry's opinion was sought and Rashtrapati Bhawan kept informed. Martial Law ended the next afternoon and normalcy was restored by evening. The Army organised a final flag march from Wellington to Raj Bhawan. Battalions of Eastern Frontier Rifles remained on standby for the next month. Idris Ali was arrested that evening and sent to Presidency Prison. The West Bengal Government was praised for its handling of the situation. Governor Gandhi gave a publicly broadcast speech to appeal for communal calm.  Aftermath  Two months after the incident, Dharmamukta Manabbadi Mancha, an organization of secular Muslims, held a press conference at the Press Club in Kolkata in protest of the expulsion of Taslima Nasreen from Kolkata.

Rockin' Around Britain. Omnibus Press that the band hailed from Melksham. The band has been variously categorised as Alternative rock, shoegazing, indie rock, psychedelic rock, and post punk. The band released two albums on Paperhouse Records, and appeared on two compilation releases, along with artists such as Nirvana, Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, Echo and The Bunnymen, and The Wedding Present. History The band was formed by John Packwood (guitar), Tim Kerley (drums), Neale Hancock (vocals/guitar), and Simon Wigglesworth (bass), all of whom had previously played together in The Hunny Monsturs.Moody, Frogg & Nash, Richard (2010) Endless Beat: Voices of the New Sarum Sound 1970‚Äì1999, Timezone, , p. 247-253 The band's name is a reference to a figure in conspiracy theories surrounding the death of John F. Kennedy. The band's initial release, \\"Go Insane!\\", appeared on a two track shared flexi disc along with a contribution from fellow Salisbury indie pop band The Mayfields (part of a lively local indie scene also including Bubblegum Splash! and Jane from Occupied Europe (band)). The disc was distributed by several popular fanzines, including Sowing Seeds, and led to The Badgeman being signed by the well respected independent label Glass Records (other artists on this label included Spacemen 3, The Pastels, Jazz Butcher, and Mayo Thompson) during 1989. The band recorded an album for Glass but it remained unreleased due to the label's financial problems, and when the label dissolved, its founder David E. Barker signed The Badgeman to his new venture Paperhouse (along with Walkingseeds, Teenage Fanclub, Phil Shoenfelt, Don Fleming and Gumball), a subsidiary of Fire Records of London. A single, \\"Crystals\\", and album, Kings of the Desert, were released in January 1990 to favourable reviews and articles from such journalists as Edwin Pouncey (aka Savage Pencil) and Phil McMullen in NME, Melody Maker, Sounds, Ptolemaic Terrascope, and the first issue of Select magazine (which awarded the album 4 out of 5). The general critical consensus at the time appeared to describe The Badgeman as a 1960s inspired indie rock band, whilst after one of several plays on his radio show, the DJ John Peel described their single, \\"Crystals\\", as \\"prog rock\\". The band toured Europe in 1990 with Teenage Fanclub. At the end of 1990 The Badgeman recorded four tracks which were to appear during 1991 as the Curse of The Badgeman EP. This release, according to Moody and Nash in their book Endless Beat, was regarded by the band as a huge step forward artistically. During the same year Imaginary Records (home to The Bachelor Pad, Cud, and The Mock Turtles) released a version of \\"Sister Ray\\", recorded by The Badgeman during 1990, as part of a three volume tribute to The Velvet Underground entitled Heaven & Hell. This recording resurfaced during 2010 as part of another VU tribute, Unpiecing The Jigsaw, released by Ozit Records. The final LP by The Badgeman appeared on Paperhouse c. early 1992. Entitled Ritual Landscape, this album was a critical and commercial failure at the time of its release but has since come to be regarded as an artistic triumph. The album's most notable champion, the musician, writer, and historian Julian Cope went so far as to make Ritual Landscape his Unsung Album Of The Month in December 2007 on his highly regarded Head Heritage Unsung website, describing the band's sound in such terms as \\"post punk..folk..muscular..heathen racket\\".Cope, Julian (2007) \\"Julian Cope's Album of the Month: The Badgeman Ritual Landscape\\", headheritage.co.uk, December 2007, retrieved 2011-12-01 The same review appears in Cope's book of collected writings on the subject of obscure or underappreciated rock and roll, Copendium.Cope, Julian (2012) \\"Copendium;An exploration into The Rock and Roll Underworld\\", Faber and Faber, , p. 347 - 52 The cover art features in Andrew Johnstones book How The Neolthics Influenced Rock'n'RollJohnstone, How The Neolthics Influenced Rock'n'Roll, The band split up shortly after the album's release, with Hancock, Wigglesworth, and Kerley forming Big Bird.

Only one was built, by its designer in 1934; it remained active until the outbreak of World War II. Design and development The City of Leeds was designed and built by R. F. Stedman, a member of what was then the Bradford and County Gliding Club, over the period 1932-4. It flew for the first time on 21 July 1934 from Baildon in West Yorkshire. It was a simple wooden aircraft, with open cockpits and wings of modest aspect ratio, not intended for high performance. Its wing was built around two spars and had constant chord apart from slight leading edge taper near the tip. There were no airbrakes or flaps. The wing was mounted parasol fashion on pairs of parallel, broad chord lift struts which joined the spars at about mid-span to the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage was flat sided and hexagonal in cross section. The cockpits were in tandem, one at the wing leading edge and the other under the wing at mid-chord. A single landing skid ran from the nose to below the wing trailing edge. The fuselage tapered slightly rearwards, where a straight edged tailplane was mounted on its upper surface. The fin was small, carrying a taller, balanced, wide chord and curved rudder which reached down to the bottom of the fuselage, moving in a cut-out between the elevators. Operational history Plans of the TS-1 were advertised at ¬£8-8-0 (¬£8.40), but only the prototype was built. This obtained its Certificate of Airworthiness BGA 213 in April 1935 after some modification and strengthening.

The 187 amino-acid propeptide pro- hevein is cleaved in two fragments: a N-terminal 43 amino-acid Hevein bearing a chitin-binding type-1 domain (also known as CBM18 carbohydrate-binding module) that binds to chitin and a 138 amino-acid Win-like protein bearing a Barwin domain. It has antifungal properties.  Role of hevein in latex allergy  Hevein is the main IgE-binding epitope of the major latex allergen prohevein as are hevein-like protein domains in fruit class I chitinases. Therefore it is a possible cause for allergen cross-reactivity between latex and banana or other fruits like chestnuts or avocadoes. Hevein-like genes can be found in many plants including Arabidopsis thaliana. Hevein is called Hev b 6 under the WHO allergen nomenclature. There are three entries under this classification, corresponding to the conformational epitopes Hev b 6.01, Hev b 6.03, and Hev b 6.03.

Description  They are evergreen trees up to 25 m high with spicy odor and hermaphrodites. The leaves are alternate, entire, elliptical or narrowly elliptical glossy in appearance, pointed oval in shape with an apical mucro, or 'drip tip', which permit the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing perspiration and respiration from plant in wet laurel forest habitat. The fruit is a berry dispersed mostly by birds. They are present in low and mountain cloud forest in Caribbean islands, Central America, and norther to central South America. The genus was described by published in Taxon 35 (1): 165 in 1986. The type species is Kubitzkia mezii (Kosterman.) Van der Werff. Ecology The neotropical genus Kubitzia of the family Lauraceae currently includes 2 species, the differences are ecological adaptations to different environments over a relatively dry-wet climate. Species in less humid environment are smaller or less robust, with less abundant and thinner foliage and have oleifera cells that give trees a more fragrant aroma. They are poorly defined botanically. The most known trees are used by the timber industry. The wood has a high commercial value. The genera Kubitzia is closely related to genera Dicypellium, Phyllostemonodaphne, Systemonodaphne and Urbanodendron. Its distribution extends from the islands of the Antilles in the Caribbean throughout the Guianas and the Amazon region but also in the Pacific coastal areas of Colombia. They grow mostly in tropical forests and Andean cloud forest. They do not form large stands but rather small groups of trees with a density of up to one individual per five hectares. Due to the low density, exploitation of the natural populations is to the detriment of the rainforest. Overexploitation is ease due to the distribution in inaccessible rainforest regions and its low density, it is very hard to survey population trends in figures, but overexploitation is evident. Proposals of exploitation must be made before overexploitation of nature poblations causes problems for commercial utilisation. The fruit, a berry.

He spent much of his life as an Inspector of Mines, before being offered the post of Professor of Mining at the University College of Wales. His life was spent improving the lot of miners and working to determine the causes of explosions and accidents in mines and finding ways of preventing them or alleviating their impact. His efforts were recognised in 1924, when, at the age of 83, he was knighted.The Compact Edition of the Dictionary of National Biography Vol. II The Oxford University Press 1975 Early life and education William Galloway was born in Paisley,1851 Scotland Census the eldest son of William Galloway (1799‚Äì1854), JP, a Paisley shawl manufacturer and coal and iron master from Paisley in Scotland and his second wife, Margaret Lindsay (1818‚Äì1902), daughter of Thomas Lindsay, a brewer from Glasgow. Galloway attended a private school in Scotland before going to Germany where he studied at the University of Giessen and the Technische Universitat Bergakademie Freiberg. He also studied at University College, London. He was proficient in six languages, and in later life received an honorary degree D.Sc. from the University of Wales, where he was employed as a Professor of Mining. Mining career In 1861, at the age of 21, Galloway was employed as the colliery manager at Cambusnethan, in Lanarkshire, Scotland. He held a first class certificate under the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1872 after being examined in June 1873 and June 1879. As a mining inspector in Scotland he investigated the causes of between 60 and 80 accidents before moving to Wales. On 3 December 1875 at Old Pit in New Tredegar, after a minor explosion the previous day where no gas had been detected, the men entered the pit against orders and at 8:00 a.m. there was a tremendous explosion killing 20 men and boys instantly and two more died from their injuries. Three days later, on 6 December 1875, at Llan Colliery, Pentyrch, another explosion killed 12 men and boys. Galloway as mining inspector reported his findings at the inquest. He found that both the timbers and miners furthest from the point of ignition were the most severely burned, reinforcing his theory that in dry mines coal dust spreads the explosion. His conclusions were accepted by the coroner and 'watering' and spreading stone dust were introduced as a result of his observations at Llan. In 1876 he delivered lectures in Paris, France with Jules Pierre Callon and Sir Clement le Neve Foster, which have been translated and printed in 'Lectures on mining delivered at the School of Mines, Paris' By the start of the 1880s his theories on the dangers of coal dust were being taken more seriously and have been discussed in many books and articles from then to the present day. In 1884, he was called on to give evidence at the Penycraig disaster and his evidence, as printed in the Cardiff Western Mail 1884, is held by the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers NEIMME, along with a course of lectures on mining given by him for the South Wales Institute of Engineers in 1900. On 23 April 1887 he was elected as a member of the NEIMME. and from 1896 to 1903 and 1907 to 1910 he was a council member of the Institute of Mining Engineers for Cardiff. In January 1907 he was called before the Royal Commission on Mines to give evidence with regard to 'watering' the mine floor and its effectiveness, and in 1910 his evidence was given to the Miners' Federation of Great Britain after the Wellington Pit Disaster. Not all the loss of life in the mines was caused by explosions. Some like the Troehydriw disaster of 1877 and the Townhead disaster of 1913 involved extensive flooding in which some men survived after air and supplies were passed to them through bore holes while they awaited rescue. The rescue took ten days in Troehydriw and the country including Queen Victoria expressed concern for the men and she requested photographic proof of their safe rescue. The survivors at Townhead had to wait for five days before rescue in 1913. Both of these were incidents that William Galloway had to attend as mining inspector. By 1923, he followed his family tradition by becoming an owner/director of collieries. He became the chairman and a director of the East Kent Colliery Company and director of the Snowdown Colliery. Inventions and research In 1870, Galloway began investigations into the cause of explosions in dry mines, and became convinced that the cause was coal dust as well as fire damp. He was called on, as a mining inspector, to investigate the causes of between 60 and 80 explosions in Scottish mines and it became his life's work to find ways to reduce the risk to the lives on miners underground. He carried out tests with safety lamps, finding that the flame was deflected through the gauze when shots were fired, measured the varying size and colour of flame depending on the atmospheric conditions and composition. He wrote papers on his findings and presented them to the Institute of Mining, the Royal Society, the Athenaeum Club, London and anyone else who would listen. In 1872 he wrote an article together with Robert H. Scott F.R.S., Director of the Meteorological Office entitled 'On the connection between colliery explosions and the weather in 1872' showing there was more likelihood of explosions in dry weather than wet in shallow mines. The article was published by the Royal Meteorological Society in its Quarterly Journal of 1875, Vol. 2, Issue 12, pp 195‚Äì205. He undertook numerous experiments to determine the size of the flame in lamps that determined the percentage of fire damp in the atmosphere, but details that were ridiculed at the time have since been found to be extremely accurate. Galloway devised an improved walling cradle enabling two teams of workers to operate on different levels at the same time. He also devised a means of substituting the cages with water tanks to remove large quantities of water from flooded mines quickly. They became known as Galloway pneumatic tanks In 1875, he patented the idea of using twin guides or guide ropes for the kibble, allowing two kibbles to be used to sink a shaft. He also devised improved counterbalanced doors to cover the shaft top, speeding up operations and reducing the danger of injury to men, and damage to the shaft. He designed a steel bucket to carry the coal underground with wheels lubricated from hollow axle boxes and buffers, giving a smoother ride and lessening the amount of coal dust dropped on the road, and he also devised an engine small enough to be taken down in a cage and which could run along the tracks and be operated by compressed air, removing the need for pit ponies for hauling coal trucks. He installed a compressed air system using two engines to raise and lower equipment at Llanbradach colliery. Later life Being unable to gain promotion in to senior inspector, possibly because he was a Scotsman in Wales, Galloway resigned his post as assistant Inspector of Mines. He became the first Professor of Mining at the University College of Wales in Cardiff. Resigning from there in 1902. He became a consultant engineer and took on work in Britain and abroad, for example, Assam, and the Cape of Good Hope. On 22 February 1917 he presented a paper to the Commission on Mines at the Houses of Parliament with regard to his findings on the explosive properties of coal dust. Sir William Galloway died 2 November 1927 at his home in Park Place, Cardiff,\\"The Late Sir William Galloway\\".

The station is on the Howrah‚ÄìDelhi main line. It is the 8th busiest railway station in India in terms of frequency of trains after Kanpur Central, Vijayawada Junction, Delhi Junction, New Delhi, Ambala Cant, Howrah and Patna Junction. Around 171 trains pass through the station daily. It serves Asansol and the surrounding areas.

Apart from factories, there are many coalmines, some closed now, and some with fires burning deep in the mineshafts. The mining area extends for a large area, mostly to the south of the tracks. Quite a portion of the track passes through cuttings, where the surrounding area is higher than the track level, resulting in the profusion of characteristic small masonry bridges crossing the tracks.\\" This description is from \\"Gomoh loco shed and CLW trip record\\" by Samit Roychoudhury. History During the middle of the nineteenth century, Carr, Tagore and Company transported coal from Narayankuri ghat on the Damodar River to Kolkata, then known as Calcutta. However, as the flow of water in the river was inconsistent, supplies were irregular. In order to capture the lucrative coal transport business, East Indian Railway, extended the railway track that had been laid between Kolkata and Hooghly to Raniganj in 1855 and up to Asansol in July 1863. File:Raniganj Coalfield 1867.jpg The East Indian Railway needed land to develop the infrastructure for the railways. While the Searsol Raj, then the zamindar in the Raniganj area, refused to provide the land, the Panchakot Raj, then functioning from Kashipur, agreed to provide the land in Shergarh, of which Asansol was then a part in 1863‚Äì64, East Indian Railway purchased a large area of jungle land from the Panchakot Raj, thereby initiating the development of Asansol as an industrial area. Subsequently, Asansol gained further in importance. What was later known as the Sahibganj Loop was the first line from Kolkata to Delhi and the first direct train started in 1866, but the shorter line via Asansol and Jhajha came up in 1871. It was initially called the Chord line but as it attracted more traffic, was rechristened the main line and the earlier main line became Sahibganj loop. With the completion of the Sitarampur‚ÄìGaya‚ÄìMughalsarai Grand Chord in 1901 (formally inaugurated in 1906 and finally opened in 1907), the Kolkata‚ÄìDelhi rail distance became even shorter, and Asansol started functioning as the junction station of the main and chord lines, as Sitarampur, the actual junction, near Asansol, is a comparatively smaller station. While momentous developments were taking place in connecting Delhi and Kolkata by rail, Bengal Nagpur Railway extended its tracks to the Asansol coal belt in 1887, thus connecting Adra with Asansol. The railway establishment at Asansol contributed substantially to its development and growth. Electrification Electrification of the railways gained momentum in the early fifties. Although initial installations were with 3 kV DC traction, the railways subsequently adopted the 25 kV AC system. Electrification of the Bardhaman-Mughalsarai section was completed in 1957 and the Howrah-Gaya stretch was electrified by around 1960. The Tatanagar-Adra-Asansol section was electrified in the 1957-1962 period. Locomotive shed Asansol is home to the oldest electric locomotive shed of Indian Railways. It houses WAP-4, WAG-5, WAM-4 and WAG-7. Asansol Division Established in 1925, Asansol Division is one of the oldest divisions of Indian Railways. On the Howrah‚ÄìDelhi main line, its jurisdiction extends from the distant signal of Khana junction to the distant signal of Jhajha . On the Grand Chord line its jurisdiction extends up to the distant signal of Pradhankhunta. Branch lines under its jurisdiction are: Andal‚ÄìSainthia, Andal‚ÄìTapasi‚ÄìBarabani‚ÄìSitarampur, Madhupur‚ÄìGiridih, Jasidih‚ÄìBaidyanathdham and Jasidih‚ÄìDumka. With a total of 565 route kilometers, the division has quadruple lines (two up and two down line) from Khana to Sitarampur. It handles 100 mail/express trains daily and 212 passenger train runs per day. The number of originating passengers per day is 144,070.

It began considering normalizing relations with China at the start of the 1970s; the two countries established diplomatic relations on 9 June 1975 with the signing of the Joint Communiqu√© by leaders of the two countries. Over the 34 years, China‚ÄìPhilippines relations in general have attained a smooth development, and also remarkable achievements in all areas of bilateral cooperation. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, there has been frequent exchange of high-level visits between China and the Philippines. Philippine Presidents Marcos (June 1975), Corazon Aquino (April 1988), Ramos (April 1993), Estrada (May 2000), Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (November 2001 and September 2004), and Benigno Aquino III (August‚ÄìSeptember 2011) have visited China. Premier Li Peng (December 1990), Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 8th National People's Congress Mr. Qiao Shi (August 1993), President Jiang Zemin (November 1996), Premier Zhu Rongji (November 1999), Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 9th National People's Congress Mr. Li Peng (September 2002), Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People's Congress Mr. Wu Bangguo (August 2003), President Hu Jintao (April 2005) and Premier Wen Jiabao (January 2007) visited the Philippines. During President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the Philippines in 1996, leaders of the two countries agreed to establish a cooperative relationship based on good-neighborliness and mutual trust towards the 21st century, and reached important consensus and understanding of \\"Shelving disputes and going in for joint development\\" on the issue of South China Sea. In 2000, China and the Philippines signed the \\"Joint Statement Between China and the Philippines on the Framework of Bilateral Cooperation in the Twenty- First Century\\", which confirmed that the two sides will establish a long-term and stable relationship on the basis of good neighborliness, cooperation, mutual trust and benefit. During President Hu Jintao's state visit to the Philippines in 2005, both countries are determined to establish the strategic and cooperative relations that aim at the peace and development. During Premier Wen Jiabao's official visit to the Philippines in January 2007, both sides issued a joint statement, reaffirming the commitment of taking further steps to deepen the strategic and cooperative relationship for peace and development between the two countries. In April 2007 President Arroyo attended the annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia.

Trade and commerce Binondo, the oldest chinatown in the world and an important business center in Manila Bilateral trade volume in 2007 was US$30.62 billion. From January to October 2008, bilateral trade volume reached US$25.3 billion, an increase of 1.4% as compared with the same period last year. By the end of September 2008, the actually utilized value of accumulative investment from the Philippines to China reached US$2.5 billion. China's transformation into a major economic power in the 21st century has led to an increase of foreign investments in the bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties. In 1999, China's Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture of the Philippines signed the Agreement on Strengthening Cooperation in Agriculture and Related Fields. In 2000, relevant government agencies signed an agreement whereby China offers the Philippines US$100 million credit facility. In March 2003, China's aid project the China- Philippines Agricultural Technology Center was completed.

Chinese Filipinos are well represented in all levels of Philippine society, and well integrated politically and economically. The ethnically Chinese Filipinos comprise 1.6% (1.5 million) of the population or ~15-27% of the population including all variants of Chinese mestizos. Pure Chinese Filipinos comprise the 9th largest, and the largest non-indigenous ethnic group in the Philippines. Chinese Filipinos are present within several commerce and business sectors in the Philippines and a few sources estimate companies which comprise a majority of the Philippine economy are owned by Chinese Filipinos, if one includes Chinese mestizos.Amy Chua, \\"World on Fire\\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3 & 43. In view of the ongoing territorial dispute of China and the Philippines (such as Scarborough Shoal), Chinese-Filipinos prefer a peaceful solution through diplomatic talks while some view that China should not extend its claims to other parts of South China Sea. There are 24 pairs of sister-cities or sister-provinces between China and the Philippines, namely: Hangzhou and Baguio City, Guangzhou and Manila City, Shanghai and Metro Manila, Xiamen and Cebu City, Shenyang and Quezon City, Fushun and Lipa City, Hainan and Cebu Province, Sanya and Lapu- Lapu City, Shishi and Naya City, Shandong and Ilocos Norte Province, Zibo and Manduae City, Anhui and Cavite Province, Hubei and Leyte Province, Liuzhou and Muntinlupa City, Hezhou and San Fernando City, Harbin and Cagayan de Oro City, Laibin and Laoag City, Beijing and Manila City, Jiangxi and Bohol Province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Davao City, Lanzhou and Albay Province, Beihai and Puerto Princessa City, Fujian Province and Laguna Province, Wuxi and Puerto Princessa City. The Chinese official Xinhua News Agency has its branch in Manila while CCTV-4, the Chinese international TV program, has landed in the Philippines. Territorial disputes = Spratly Islands and the South China Sea = Territorial claims in the South China Sea The two countries have disputes over the sovereignty of some islands and shoals in the Spratly Islands. After rounds of consultations, both sides agreed to strive for a solution through bilateral friendly consultation. In October 2004, Chinese Maritime Safety Administration and Philippine Coast Guard conducted a joint sand table rescue exercise for the first time. China National Offshore Oil Corp. and Philippine National Oil Company signed the \\"Agreement for Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking on Certain Areas in the South China Sea\\" on September 1, 2004. In May 2005, Vietnam agreed to join the Sino-Philippine cooperation. Oil companies from three countries signed the \\"Agreement for Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking on Certain Areas in the South China Sea\\" in March, 2005. Due to the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff, relations between the two countries have soured greatly after China pursued to grab the Scarborough Shoal, which has been in Philippine possession until the standoff. After a few weeks, a storm passed by the area and the international community of nations urged both nations to ease tensions by withdrawing from the site. Both nations agreed to withdraw, however, when the Philippines withdrew, China immediately sent warships to counter any arrival from the Philippine side. The blatant defiance to the truce met international outcry towards China. China afterwards began establishing structures on the shoal. An American footage showed after a few months that the shoal may possess Chinese ballistic missiles.Zirulnick, Ariel. \\"Philippines feels the economic cost of standing up to China.\\" CS Monitor, 15 May 2012. In April 2019, international satellites and local reports revealed that Chinese ships have swarmed Philippine-controlled areas in the South China Sea through a cabbage strategy. Later reports showed that endangered giant clams under Philippine law protection were illegally being harvested by Chinese ships. The swarming continued for the entirety of April, with the Philippine foreign affairs secretary, Teddy Locsin Jr., expressing dismay over the incident and calling it an intentional \\"embarrassment\\" aimed against the Philippines. A few days before the 2019 Philippine independence day, President Duterte stated that the country may go to war with China if China claims disputed resources.  2019 Reed Bank incident  On June 9, a Chinese ship, Yuemaobinyu 42212, rammed and sank a Philippine fishing vessel, F/B Gem-Ver, near Reed Bank, west of Palawan. The fishermen were caught by surprise as they were asleep during the said event. The Chinese ship afterwards left the sank Philippine vessel, while the Filipino fishermen were adrift in the middle of sea and left to the elements, in violation of a rule under UNCLOS. The 22 Filipino fishermen were later rescued by a ship from Vietnam. The government responded a day later, stating that they may cut ties with China if the culprits are not punished by the Chinese. China has stated that the event was an ordinary maritime accident, which was later backed up by investigations from the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The Chinese crew was later criticized for failing to undertake measures to avoid colliding with the F/B Gem-Ver and abandoning the stricken boat's crew, in violation of maritime laws. = Benham Rise = In March 2017, Chinese ships were spotted in the Benham Rise, a protected food supply exclusive zone of the Philippines. The Philippines, through its ambassador to Beijing has officially asked China to explain the reported presence of one of its vessels in Benham Rise in the Pacific. A week later, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement saying that China is honoring the Philippines' sovereign rights over Benham Rise, and that the ship was passing by. However, the ship was revealed to have been on the area for about three months. In May 2017, Philippine president Duterte revealed that Chinese president Xi Jinping made an unveiled threat of war against the Philippines over the islands in the South China Sea during a meeting in Beijing. In January 2018, the Department of Foreign Affairs approved the Chinese Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to perform a scientific survey of the Rise, with the approval of President Rodrigo Duterte. In February, Duterte ordered the halting of all foreign researches in the Philippines Rise, however, the research being conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences was already finished before the halt order. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the UNESCO have rules wherein the entity that first discovers unnamed features underwater have the right to name those features, prompting Filipino officials to realize that China was after, not just research, but also the naming rights over the underwater features of the Philippine Rise which will be internationally recognized through UNESCO. It was later clarified by the Philippine government that all researches ongoing at the time the halting was made were officially cancelled, but the government still allows research activities in the Rise. Foreign researchers may still do research within the Rise if they apply for research activities through the Philippine government. The government is also maintaining that the Rise belongs to the Philippines. On February 12, 2018, the International Hydrographic Organization approved the names proposed by China for five features in the Philippine Rise after China submitted to the organization its research findings on the area. The Chinese naming of the features met public protests in the Philippines. =2016 UNCLOS-PCA ruling on Spratly= In January 2013, the Philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against China's claim on the territories within the \\"nine-dash line\\" that includes Spratly Islands, which it said is \\"unlawful\\" under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). An arbitration tribunal was constituted under Annex VII of UNCLOS and it was decided in July 2013 that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) would function as registry and provide administrative duties in the proceedings. On 12 July 2016, the arbitrators of the tribunal of PCA agreed unanimously with the Philippines. They concluded in the award that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources, hence there was \\"no legal basis for China to claim historic rights\\" over the nine- dash line. Accordingly, the PCA tribunal decision is ruled as final and non- appealable by either countries. The tribunal also criticized China's land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands in the Spratly Islands, saying that it had caused \\"severe harm to the coral reef environment\\". It also characterized Taiping Island and other features of the Spratly Islands as \\"rocks\\" under UNCLOS, and therefore are not entitled to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. China however rejected the ruling, calling it \\"ill-founded\\". Taiwan, which currently administers Taiping Island, the largest of the Spratly Islands, also rejected the ruling. On 26 June 2020, the Statement of the 36th ASEAN Summit was released. The Statement said the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is ‚Äúthe basis for determining maritime entitlements, sovereign rights, jurisdiction and legitimate interests over maritime zones, and the 1982 UNCLOS sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.‚Äù See also * Bamboo network * Paduka Pahala China * List of diplomatic missions in the People's Republic of China * List of diplomatic missions of the People's Republic of China Philippines * List of diplomatic missions in the Philippines * List of diplomatic missions of the Philippines References External links * Chinese Embassy in Manila * Philippines Embassy in Beijing China, Peoples Republic Philippines ","title":"China‚ÄìPhilippines relations"},{"id":"33734280","text":"Knox City High School is a public high school situated on the north edge of Knox City, Texas United States and classified as a 1A school by the UIL.

The book uses data simply documenting declining violence across time and geography. This paints a picture of massive declines in violence of all forms, from war, to improved treatment of children. He highlights the role of nation-state monopolies on force, of commerce (making \\"other people become more valuable alive than dead\\"), of increased literacy and communication (promoting empathy), as well as a rise in a rational problem-solving orientation as possible causes of this decline in violence. He notes that, paradoxically, our impression of violence has not tracked this decline, perhaps because of increased communication, and that further decline is not inevitable, but is contingent on forces harnessing our better motivations such as empathy and increases in reason. Thesis The book's title was taken from the ending of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address. Pinker uses the phrase as a metaphor for four human motivations empathy, self-control, the \\"moral sense,\\" and reason that, he writes, can \\"orient us away from violence and towards cooperation and altruism.\\" Pinker presents a large amount of data (and statistical analysis thereof) that, he argues, demonstrate that violence has been in decline over millennia and that the present is probably the most peaceful time in the history of the human species. The decline in violence, he argues, is enormous in magnitude, visible on both long and short time scales, and found in many domains, including military conflict, homicide, genocide, torture, criminal justice, and treatment of children, homosexuals, animals and racial and ethnic minorities. He stresses that \\"The decline, to be sure, has not been smooth; it has not brought violence down to zero; and it is not guaranteed to continue.\\" Pinker argues that the radical declines in violent behavior that he documents do not result from major changes in human biology or cognition. He specifically rejects the view that humans are necessarily violent, and thus have to undergo radical change in order to become more peaceable. However, Pinker also rejects what he regards as the simplistic nature versus nurture argument, which would imply that the radical change must therefore have come purely from external (\\"nurture\\") sources. Instead, he argues: \\"The way to explain the decline of violence is to identify the changes in our cultural and material milieu that have given our peaceable motives the upper hand.\\" Pinker identifies five \\"historical forces\\" that have favored \\"our peaceable motives\\" and \\"have driven the multiple declines in violence.\\" They are: * The Leviathan ‚Äì the rise of the modern nation-state and judiciary \\"with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force,\\" which \\"can defuse the [individual] temptation of exploitative attack, inhibit the impulse for revenge, and circumvent ... self- serving biases.\\" * Commerce ‚Äì the rise of \\"technological progress [allowing] the exchange of goods and services over longer distances and larger groups of trading partners,\\" so that \\"other people become more valuable alive than dead\\" and \\"are less likely to become targets of demonization and dehumanization.\\" * Feminization ‚Äì increasing respect for \\"the interests and values of women.\\" * Cosmopolitanism ‚Äì the rise of forces such as literacy, mobility, and mass media, which \\"can prompt people to take the perspectives of people unlike themselves and to expand their circle of sympathy to embrace them.\\" * The Escalator of Reason ‚Äì an \\"intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to human affairs,\\" which \\"can force people to recognize the futility of cycles of violence, to ramp down the privileging of their own interests over others', and to reframe violence as a problem to be solved rather than a contest to be won.\\" Outline of the book The first section of the book, chapters 2 through 7, seeks to demonstrate and to analyze historical trends related to declines of violence on different scales. Chapter 8 discusses five \\"inner demons\\" - psychological systems that can lead to violence. Chapter 9 examines four \\"better angels\\" or motives that can incline people away from violence. The last chapter examines the five historical forces listed above that have led to declines in violence. = Six trends of declining violence (Chapters 2 through 7) = # The Pacification Process: Pinker describes this as the transition from \\"the anarchy of hunting, gathering, and horticultural societies ... to the first agricultural civilizations with cities and governments, beginning around five thousand years ago\\" which brought \\"a reduction in the chronic raiding and feuding that characterized life in a state of nature and a more or less fivefold decrease in rates of violent death.\\" # The Civilizing Process: Pinker argues that \\"between the late Middle Ages and the 20th century, European countries saw a tenfold-to-fiftyfold decline in their rates of homicide.\\" He attributes the idea of the Civilizing Process to the sociologist Norbert Elias, who \\"attributed this surprising decline to the consolidation of a patchwork of feudal territories into large kingdoms with centralized authority and an infrastructure on commerce.\\" # The Humanitarian Revolution ‚Äì Pinker attributes this term and concept to the historian Lynn Hunt. He says this revolution \\"unfolded on the [shorter] scale of centuries and took off around the time of the Age of Reason and the European Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries.\\" Although he also points to historical antecedents and to \\"parallels elsewhere in the world,\\" he writes: \\"It saw the first organized movements to abolish slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, sadistic punishment, and cruelty to animals, together with the first stirrings of systematic pacifism.\\" # The Long Peace: a term he attributes to the historian John Lewis Gaddis's The Long Peace: Inquiries into the history of the Cold War. This fourth \\"major transition,\\" Pinker says, \\"took place after the end of World War II.\\" During it, he says, \\"the great powers, and the developed states in general, have stopped waging war on one another.\\" # The New Peace: Pinker calls this trend \\"more tenuous,\\" but \\"since the end of the Cold War in 1989, organized conflicts of all kinds - civil wars, genocides, repression by autocratic governments, and terrorist attacks - have declined throughout the world.\\" # The Rights Revolutions: The postwar period has seen, Pinker argues, \\"a growing revulsion against aggression on smaller scales, including violence against ethnic minorities, women, children, homosexuals, and animals. These spin-offs from the concept of human rights‚Äîcivil rights, women's rights, children's rights, gay rights, and animal rights‚Äîwere asserted in a cascade of movements from the late 1950s to the present day.\\" = Five inner demons (Chapter 8) = Pinker rejects what he calls the \\"Hydraulic Theory of Violence\\" ‚Äì the idea \\"that humans harbor an inner drive toward aggression (a death instinct or thirst for blood), which builds up inside us and must periodically be discharged. Nothing could be further from contemporary scientific understanding of the psychology of violence.\\" Instead, he argues, research suggests that \\"aggression is not a single motive, let alone a mounting urge. It is the output of several psychological systems that differ in their environmental triggers, their internal logic, their neurological basis, and their social distribution.\\" He examines five such systems: # Predatory or Practical Violence: violence \\"deployed as a practical means to an end\\" # Dominance: the \\"urge for authority, prestige, glory, and power.\\" Pinker argues that dominance motivations can occur within individuals and coalitions of \\"racial, ethnic, religious, or national groups\\" # Revenge: the \\"moralistic urge toward retribution, punishment, and justice\\" # Sadism: the \\"deliberate infliction of pain for no purpose but to enjoy a person's suffering...\\" # Ideology: a \\"shared belief system, usually involving a vision of utopia, that justifies unlimited violence in pursuit of unlimited good.\\" = Four better angels (Chapter 9) = Pinker examines four motives that \\"can orient [humans] away from violence and towards cooperation and altruism.\\" He identifies: # Empathy: which \\"prompts us to feel the pain of others and to align their interests with our own.\\" # Self-Control: which \\"allows us to anticipate the consequences of acting on our impulses and to inhibit them accordingly.\\" # The Moral Sense: which \\"sanctifies a set of norms and taboos that govern the interactions among people in a culture.\\" These sometimes decrease violence but can also increase it \\"when the norms are tribal, authoritarian, or puritanical.\\" # Reason: which \\"allows us to extract ourselves from our parochial vantage points.\\" In this chapter Pinker also examines and partially rejects the idea that humans have evolved in the biological sense to become less violent. Influences Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the book Pinker uses a range of sources from different fields. Particular attention is paid to philosopher Thomas Hobbes who Pinker argues has been undervalued. Pinker's use of \\"un-orthodox\\" thinkers follows directly from his observation that the data on violence contradict our current expectations. In an earlier work Pinker characterized the general misunderstanding concerning Hobbes: Pinker also references ideas from occasionally overlooked contemporary academics, for example the works of political scientist John Mueller and sociologist Norbert Elias, among others. The extent of Elias' influence on Pinker can be adduced from the title of Chapter 3, which is taken from the title of Elias' seminal The Civilizing Process.Elias, Norbert, The Civilizing Process, Vol.I. The History of Manners, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1969), and The Civilizing Process, Vol.II. State Formation and Civilization, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1982). Pinker also draws upon the work of international relations scholar Joshua Goldstein. They co-wrote a New York Times op-ed article titled 'War Really Is Going Out of Style' that summarizes many of their shared views, and appeared together at Harvard's Institute of Politics to answer questions from academics and students concerning their similar thesis. Reception =Praise= Bill Gates considers the book one of the most important books he's ever read, and on the BBC program Desert Island Discs he selected the book as the one he would take with him to a deserted island. He has written that \\"Steven Pinker shows us ways we can make those positive trajectories a little more likely. That's a contribution, not just to historical scholarship, but to the world.\\" After Gates recommended the book as a graduate present in May 2017, the book re-entered the bestseller list.Hoffert, B. (2017). Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. Library Journal, 142(15), 55. The philosopher Peter Singer gave the book a positive review in The New York Times. Singer concludes: \\"[It] is a supremely important book. To have command of so much research, spread across so many different fields, is a masterly achievement. Pinker convincingly demonstrates that there has been a dramatic decline in violence, and he is persuasive about the causes of that decline.\\" Political scientist Robert Jervis, in a long review for The National Interest, states that Pinker \\"makes a case that will be hard to refute. The trends are not subtle ‚Äì many of the changes involve an order of magnitude or more. Even when his explanations do not fully convince, they are serious and well-grounded.\\" pdf In a review for The American Scholar, Michael Shermer writes, \\"Pinker demonstrates that long-term data trumps anecdotes. The idea that we live in an exceptionally violent time is an illusion created by the media‚Äôs relentless coverage of violence, coupled with our brain‚Äôs evolved propensity to notice and remember recent and emotionally salient events. Pinker‚Äôs thesis is that violence of all kinds‚Äîfrom murder, rape, and genocide to the spanking of children to the mistreatment of blacks, women, gays, and animals‚Äîhas been in decline for centuries as a result of the civilizing process... Picking up Pinker‚Äôs 832-page opus feels daunting, but it‚Äôs a page-turner from the start.\\" In The Guardian, Cambridge University political scientist David Runciman writes, \\"I am one of those who like to believe that... the world is just as dangerous as it has always been. But Pinker shows that for most people in most ways it has become much less dangerous.\\" Runciman concludes \\"everyone should read this astonishing book.\\" In a later review for The Guardian, written when the book was shortlisted for the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books, Tim Radford wrote, \\"in its confidence and sweep, the vast timescale, its humane standpoint and its confident world-view, it is something more than a science book: it is an epic history by an optimist who can list his reasons to be cheerful and support them with persuasive instances.... I don't know if he's right, but I do think this book is a winner.\\" Adam Lee writes, in a blog review for Big Think, that \\"even people who are inclined to reject Pinker's conclusions will sooner or later have to grapple with his arguments.\\" In a long review in The Wilson Quarterly, psychologist Vaughan Bell calls it \\"an excellent exploration of how and why violence, aggression, and war have declined markedly, to the point where we live in humanity‚Äôs most peaceful age.... [P]owerful, mind changing, and important.\\" In a long review for the Los Angeles Review of Books, anthropologist Christopher Boehm, Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and co-director of the USC Jane Goodall Research Center, called the book \\"excellent and important.\\" Political scientist James Q. Wilson, in The Wall Street Journal, called the book \\"a masterly effort to explain what Mr. Pinker regards as one of the biggest changes in human history: We kill one another less frequently than before. But to give this project its greatest possible effect, he has one more book to write: a briefer account that ties together an argument now presented in 800 pages and that avoids the few topics about which Mr. Pinker has not done careful research.\\" Specifically, the assertions to which Wilson objected were Pinker's writing that (in Wilson's summation), \\"George W. Bush 'infamously' supported torture; John Kerry was right to think of terrorism as a 'nuisance\\"; 'Palestinian activist groups' have disavowed violence and now work at building a 'competent government.' Iran will never use its nuclear weapons... [and] Mr. Bush... is 'unintellectual.' \\" Brenda Maddox, in The Telegraph, called the book \\"utterly convincing\\" and \\"well-argued.\\" Clive Cookson, reviewing it in the Financial Times, called it \\"a marvelous synthesis of science, history and storytelling, demonstrating how fortunate the vast majority of us are today to experience serious violence only through the mass media.\\" The science journalist John Horgan called it \\"a monumental achievement\\" that \\"should make it much harder for pessimists to cling to their gloomy vision of the future\\" in a largely positive review in Slate. In The Huffington Post, Neil Boyd, Professor and Associate Director of the School of Criminology at Simon Fraser University, strongly defended the book against its critics, saying: The book also saw positive reviews from The Spectator, and The Independent. =Criticism= R. Brian Ferguson, professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University‚ÄìNewark, has challenged Pinker's archaeological evidence for the frequency of war in prehistoric societies, which he contends \\"consists of cherry-picked cases with high casualties, clearly unrepresentative of history in general.\\"Ferguson, R.B. 2013. Pinker‚Äôs List: Exaggerating Prehistoric War Mortality. In: Fry, D.P., editor. War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p 112‚Äì131. Whereas \\"[b]y considering the total archaeological record of prehistoric populations of Europe and the Near East up to the Bronze Age, evidence clearly demonstrates that war began sporadically out of warless condition, and can be seen in varying trajectories in different areas, to develop over time as societies become larger, more sedentary, more complex, more bounded, more hierarchical, and in one critically important region, impacted by an expanding state.\\" Ferguson's examination contradicts Pinker's claim that violence has declined under civilization, indicating the opposite is true. Despite recommending the book as worth reading, the economist Tyler Cowen was skeptical of Pinker's analysis of the centralization of the use of violence in the hands of the modern nation state. In his review of the book in Scientific American, psychologist Robert Epstein criticizes Pinker's use of relative violent death rates, that is, of violent deaths per capita, as an appropriate metric for assessing the emergence of humanity's \\"better angels.\\" Instead, Epstein believes that the correct metric is the absolute number of deaths at a given time. Epstein also accuses Pinker of an over-reliance on historical data, and argues that he has fallen prey to confirmation bias, leading him to focus on evidence that supports his thesis while ignoring research that does not. Several negative reviews have raised criticisms related to Pinker's humanism and atheism. John N. Gray, in a critical review of the book in Prospect, writes, \\"Pinker's attempt to ground the hope of peace in science is profoundly instructive, for it testifies to our enduring need for faith.\\" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, while \\"broadly convinced by the argument that our current era of relative peace reflects a longer term trend away from violence, and broadly impressed by the evidence that Pinker marshals to support this view,\\" offered a list of criticisms and concludes Pinker assumes almost all the progress starts with \\"the Enlightenment, and all that came before was a long medieval dark.\\" Theologian David Bentley Hart wrote that \\"one encounters [in Pinker's book] the ecstatic innocence of a faith unsullied by prudent doubt.\\" Furthermore, he says, \\"it reaffirms the human spirit's lunatic and heroic capacity to believe a beautiful falsehood, not only in excess of the facts, but in resolute defiance of them.\\" Hart continues: Craig S. Lerner, a professor at George Mason University School of Law, in an appreciative but ultimately negative review in the Claremont Review of Books does not dismiss the claim of declining violence, writing, \\"let's grant that the 65 years since World War II really are among the most peaceful in human history, judged by the percentage of the globe wracked by violence and the percentage of the population dying by human hand,\\" but disagrees with Pinker's explanations and concludes that \\"Pinker depicts a world in which human rights are unanchored by a sense of the sacredness and dignity of human life, but where peace and harmony nonetheless emerge. It is a future‚Äîmostly relieved of discord, and freed from an oppressive God‚Äîthat some would regard as heaven on earth. He is not the first and certainly not the last to entertain hopes disappointed so resolutely by the history of actual human beings.\\" In a sharp exchange in the correspondence section of the Spring 2012 issue, Pinker attributes to Lerner a \\"theo-conservative agenda\\" and accuses him of misunderstanding a number of points, notably Pinker's repeated assertion that \\"historical declines of violence are 'not guaranteed to continue.'\\" Lerner, in his response, says Pinker's \\"misunderstanding of my review is evident from the first sentence of his letter\\" and questions Pinker's objectivity and refusal to \\"acknowledge the gravity\\" of issues he raises. Professor emeritus of finance and media analyst Edward S. Herman of the University of Pennsylvania, together with independent journalist David Peterson, wrote detailed negative reviews of the book for the International Socialist Review and for The Public Intellectuals Project, concluding it \\"is a terrible book, both as a technical work of scholarship and as a moral tract and guide. But it is extremely well-attuned to the demands of U.S. and Western elites at the start of the 21st century.\\" Herman and Peterson take issue with Pinker's idea of a 'Long Peace' since World War Two: \\"Pinker contends not only that the 'democracies avoid disputes with each other,' but that they 'tend to stay out of disputes across the board...' This will surely come as a surprise to the many victims of US assassinations, sanctions, subversions, bombings, and invasions since 1945.\\" Two critical reviews have been related to postmodern approaches. Elizabeth Kolbert wrote a critical review in The New Yorker, to which Pinker posted a reply. Kolbert states that \\"The scope of Pinker's attentions is almost entirely confined to Western Europe.\\" Pinker replies that his book has sections on \\"Violence Around the World\\", \\"Violence in These United States\\", and the history of war in the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Japan, and China. Kolbert states that \\"Pinker is virtually silent about Europe‚Äôs bloody colonial adventures.\\" Pinker replies that \\"a quick search would have turned up more than 25 places in which the book discusses colonial conquests, wars, enslavements, and genocides.\\" Kolbert concludes, \\"Name a force, a trend, or a ‚Äòbetter angel‚Äô that has tended to reduce the threat, and someone else can name a force, a trend, or an ‚Äòinner demon‚Äô pushing back the other way.\\" Pinker calls this \\"the postmodernist sophistry that The New Yorker so often indulges when reporting on science.\\" An explicitly postmodern critique‚Äîor more precisely, one based on perspectivism‚Äîis made at CTheory by Ben Laws, who argues that \\"if we take a 'perspectivist' stance in relation to matters of truth would it not be possible to argue the direct inverse of Pinker's historical narrative of violence? Have we in fact become even more violent over time? Each interpretation could invest a certain stake in 'truth' as something fixed and valid‚Äîand yet, each view could be considered misguided.\\" Pinker argues in his FAQ page that economic inequality, like other forms of \\"metaphorical\\" violence, \\"may be deplorable, but to lump it together with rape and genocide is to confuse moralization with understanding. Ditto for underpaying workers, undermining cultural traditions, polluting the ecosystem, and other practices that moralists want to stigmatize by metaphorically extending the term violence to them. It's not that these aren't bad things, but you can't write a coherent book on the topic of 'bad things.' ... physical violence is a big enough topic for one book (as the length of Better Angels makes clear). Just as a book on cancer needn't have a chapter on metaphorical cancer, a coherent book on violence can't lump together genocide with catty remarks as if they were a single phenomenon.\\" Quoting this, Laws argues that Pinker suffers from \\"a reductive vision of what it means to be violent.\\" John Arquilla of the Naval Postgraduate School criticized the book in Foreign Policy for using statistics that he said did not accurately represent the threats of civilians dying in war: Stephen Corry, director of the charity Survival International, criticized the book from the perspective of indigenous people's rights. He asserts that Pinker's book \\"promotes a fictitious, colonialist image of a backward 'Brutal Savage', which pushes the debate on tribal peoples' rights back over a century and [which] is still used to justify their destruction.\\" Anthropologist Rahul Oka has suggested that the apparent reduction in violence is just a scaling issue. Wars can be expected to kill larger percentages of smaller populations. As the population grows, fewer warriors are needed, proportionally. Sinisa Malesevic has argued that Pinker and other similar theorists, such as Azar Gat, articulate a false vision of human beings as being genetically predisposed to violence, while they focus on the last forty to fifty years. Statistician and philosophical essayist Nassim Nicholas Taleb used the term \\"Pinker Problem\\" to describe errors in sampling under conditions of uncertainty after corresponding with Pinker regarding the theory of great moderation. \\"Pinker doesn‚Äôt have a clear idea of the difference between science and journalism, or the one between rigorous empiricism and anecdotal statements. Science is not about making claims about a sample, but using a sample to make general claims and discuss properties that apply outside the sample.\\" In a reply, Pinker denied that his arguments had any similarity to \\"great moderation\\" arguments about financial markets, and states that \\"Taleb‚Äôs article implies that Better Angels consists of 700 pages of fancy statistical extrapolations which lead to the conclusion that violent catastrophes have become impossible... [but] the statistics in the book are modest and almost completely descriptive\\" and \\"the book explicitly, adamantly, and repeatedly denies that major violent shocks cannot happen in the future.\\" Taleb with statistician and probabilist Pasquale Cirillo went on to publish a formal refutation in the journal Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications where they investigate the theses of \\"long peace\\" and drop in violence and find that these are statistically invalid and resulting from flawed and naive methodologies, incompatible with fat tails and non-robust to minor changes in data formatting and methodologies. They propose an alternative methodology to look at violence in particular, and other aspects of quantitative historiography in general in a way compatible with statistical inference, which needs to accommodate the fat-tailedness of the data and the unreliability of the reports of conflicts. In March 2018, the academic journal Historical Reflections published the first issue of their 44th volume entirely devoted to responding to Pinker's book in light of its significant influence on the wider culture, such as its appraisal by Bill Gates. The issue contains essays by twelve historians on Pinker's thesis, and the editors of the issue Mark S. Micale, Professor of History at the University of Illinois, and Philip Dwyer, Professor of History at Newcastle University write in the introductory paper that \\"Not all of the scholars included in this journal agree on everything, but the overall verdict is that Pinker‚Äôs thesis, for all the stimulus it may have given to discussions around violence, is seriously, if not fatally, flawed. The problems that come up time and again are: the failure to genuinely engage with historical methodologies; the unquestioning use of dubious sources; the tendency to exaggerate the violence of the past in order to contrast it with the supposed peacefulness of the modern era; the creation of a number of straw men, which Pinker then goes on to debunk; and its extraordinarily Western-centric, not to say Whiggish, view of the world.\\"Micale, M.

In 1931 he was made caretaker manager of the Third Division South club, after the sacking of Jimmy McIntyre. In February 1932, he became manager of Walsall. He forged a strong link between Coventry and Walsall, and took Bill Coward, Chris Ball, Bill Sheppard and Freddie Lee from Highfield Road to Fellows Park.

Rambha and Karambha were the Asura brothers, born as the descendants of Danu. When they were young, both decided to perform penance to get special powers to establish the rule of Danavas in the universe. Penance and boon Rambha started penance standing inside burning fire to please Agni Deva, while Karambha stood inside water to please Varuna Deva. When Indra came to know about them, he decided to kill both the brothers. Firstly, he converted himself into crocodile and killed Karambha inside the water. But Agni Deva saved Rambha when Indra tried to kill him. Finally, Rambha got boon from Agni Deva that he would not be killed by any God, demon or human. Only a dead man could kill him (which was virtually impossible). Rambha became really powerful after getting boon. He started mass killing of humans and other living beings. Birth of Mahishasura Once, he saw a water buffalo and fell in love with her. So he converted himself into a water buffalo and started living with her. While the buffalo was pregnant, another male water buffalo became attracted towards her. Rambha and that stranger water buffalo had a long fight finally resulting in Rambha's death. Later, the water buffalo was killed by the soldiers of Rambha. In another version, Rambha was killed in a battle by Indra, who hurled his 'Vajra' at him. As the 'Vajra' was made out of the bones of the dead sage Dadhichi, it killed Rambha. The water buffalo gave birth to a demon Mahishasura. As he was born out of the union of a buffalo and asura, so he had ability to change between human and buffalo form at will. Rebirth According to legends, Rambha was reborn as Raktabija, the army commander of Shumbha and Nishumbha. When Kaushiki was sent to crush the growing power of these two demon brothers, she had to face the stiffest opposition from Raktabija. He had the boon that if a single drop of his blood falls on the ground, another new Raktabija would be created, making him almost invincible. Kaushiki then took the form of Kali, and licked off the blood before they touched the ground. Gradually, Raktabija was defeated and killed. References * Ralph T.H.

Current usage of the term \\"visual arts\\" includes fine art as well as the applied or decorative arts and crafts, but this was not always the case. Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' had for some centuries often been restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the decorative arts, craft, or applied Visual arts media. The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.Art History: Arts and Crafts Movement: (1861‚Äì1900). From World Wide Arts Resources . Retrieved 24 October 2009. Art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts. The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of Western art as well as East Asian art. In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist, and the furthest removed from manual labour ‚Äì in Chinese painting the most highly valued styles were those of \\"scholar-painting\\", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs. The Western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes. Education and training Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the apprentice and workshop systems. In Europe the Renaissance movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the academy system for training artists, and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in art schools at tertiary levels. Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems. Drawing Drawing is a means of making an image, illustration or graphic using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques available online and offline. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools, including pens, stylus, Apple pencil that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman. Drawing goes back at least 16,000 years to Paleolithic cave representations of animals such as those at Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain. In ancient Egypt, ink drawings on papyrus, often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on Greek vases, initially geometric, later developed to the human form with black-figure pottery during the 7th century BC.History of Drawing. From Dibujos para Pintar. Retrieved 23 October 2009. With paper becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as Sandro Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture. Painting Mosaic of Battle of Issus Nefertari with Isis Painting taken literally is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a carrier (or medium) and a binding agent (a glue) to a surface (support) such as paper, canvas or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing, composition, or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to The Sistine Chapel to the human body itself. =Origins and early history= Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the Chauvet and Lascaux caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer. Spasimo (1514‚Äì1516) Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of Ramses II, Nefertari, his queen, is depicted being led by Isis.History of Painting.

One of the best remaining representations are the Hellenistic Fayum mummy portraits. Another example is mosaic of the Battle of Issus at Pompeii, which was probably based on a Greek painting. Greek and Roman art contributed to Byzantine art in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting. =The Renaissance= Apart from the illuminated manuscripts produced by monks during the Middle Ages, the next significant contribution to European art was from Italy's renaissance painters. From Giotto in the 13th century to Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael at the beginning of the 16th century, this was the richest period in Italian art as the chiaroscuro techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-D space.History of Renaissance Painting.

Le D√©jeuner sur l‚Äôherbe (1866) =Dutch masters= The 17th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile Rembrandt who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes, and Vermeer who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life. =Baroque= The Baroque started after the Renaissance, from the late 16th century to the late 17th century. Main artists of the Baroque included Caravaggio, who made heavy use of tenebrism. Peter Paul Rubens was a flemish painter who studied in Italy, worked for local churches in Antwerp and also painted a series for Marie de' Medici. Annibale Carracci took influences from the Sistine Chapel and created the genre of illusionistic ceiling painting. Much of the development that happened in the Baroque was because of the Protestant Reformation and the resulting Counter Reformation. Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals. =Impressionism= Impressionism began in France in the 19th century with a loose association of artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul C√©zanne who brought a new freely brushed style to painting, often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio. This was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality. They achieved intense colour vibration by using pure, unmixed colours and short brush strokes. The movement influenced art as a dynamic, moving through time and adjusting to new found techniques and perception of art. Attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving, whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artists eye.Impressionism. Webmuseum, Paris. Retrieved 24 October 2009 Paul Gauguin: The Vision After the Sermon (1888) Edvard Munch: The Scream (1893) =Post-impressionism= Towards the end of the 19th century, several young painters took impressionism a stage further, using geometric forms and unnatural colour to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism. Of particular note are Paul Gauguin, who was strongly influenced by Asian, African and Japanese art, Vincent van Gogh, a Dutchman who moved to France where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south, and Toulouse-Lautrec, remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the Paris district of Montmartre.Post-Impressionism. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 October 2009. =Symbolism, expressionism and cubism= Edvard Munch, a Norwegian artist, developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the 19th century, inspired by the French impressionist Manet. The Scream (1893), his most famous work, is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Partly as a result of Munch's influence, the German expressionist movement originated in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century as artists such as Ernst Kirschner and Erich Heckel began to distort reality for an emotional effect. In parallel, the style known as cubism developed in France as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition. Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were the leading proponents of the movement. Objects are broken up, analyzed, and re- assembled in an abstracted form. By the 1920s, the style had developed into surrealism with Dali and Magritte.Modern Art Movements. Irish Art Encyclopedia. Retrieved 25 October 2009. Printmaking Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists Printmaking is creating, for artistic purposes, an image on a matrix that is then transferred to a two-dimensional (flat) surface by means of ink (or another form of pigmentation). Except in the case of a monotype, the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print. Albrecht D√ºrer: Melancholia I (1541) Historically, the major techniques (also called media) involved are woodcut, line engraving, etching, lithography, and screenprinting (serigraphy, silkscreening) but there are many others, including modern digital techniques. Normally, the print is printed on paper, but other mediums range from cloth and vellum to more modern materials. Major printmaking traditions include that of Japan (ukiyo-e). =European history= Prints in the Western tradition produced before about 1830 are known as old master prints. In Europe, from around 1400 AD woodcut, was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds. Michael Wolgemut improved German woodcut from about 1475, and Erhard Reuwich, a Dutchman, was the first to use cross- hatching. At the end of the century Albrecht D√ºrer brought the Western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed, increasing the status of the single- leaf woodcut.The Printed Image in the West: History and Techniques. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 October 2009. =Chinese origin and practice= The Chinese Diamond Sutra, the world's oldest printed book (868 CE) In China, the art of printmaking developed some 1,100 years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper. Initially images were mainly religious but in the Song Dynasty, artists began to cut landscapes. During the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and Qing (1616‚Äì1911) dynasties, the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings.Engraving in Chinese Art. From Engraving Review .

Retrieved 25 October 2009. =Development in Japan 1603‚Äì1867= Hokusai: Red Fuji southern wind clear morning from Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (1830-1832) Woodblock printing in Japan (Japanese: Êú®ÁâàÁîª, moku hanga) is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo-e artistic genre; however, it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period. Woodblock printing had been used in China for centuries to print books, long before the advent of movable type, but was only widely adopted in Japan surprisingly late, during the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867). Although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards, moku hanga differs greatly in that water-based inks are used (as opposed to western woodcut, which uses oil-based inks), allowing for a wide range of vivid color, glazes and color transparency. Photography Photography is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light. The light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed exposure. The process is done through mechanical shutters or electronically timed exposure of photons into chemical processing or digitizing devices known as cameras. The word comes from the Greek words œÜœâœÇ phos (\\"light\\"), and Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπœÇ graphis (\\"stylus\\", \\"paintbrush\\") or Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ∑ graph√™, together meaning \\"drawing with light\\" or \\"representation by means of lines\\" or \\"drawing.\\" Traditionally, the product of photography has been called a photograph. The term photo is an abbreviation; many people also call them pictures. In digital photography, the term image has begun to replace photograph. (The term image is traditional in geometric optics.) Architecture Architecture is the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or any other structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is De architectura, by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the early 1st century AD. According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of firmitas, utilitas, venustas, commonly known by the original translation ‚Äì firmness, commodity and delight. An equivalent in modern English would be: #Durability ‚Äì a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition. #Utility ‚Äì it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used. #Beauty ‚Äì it should be aesthetically pleasing. Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means (available building materials and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a craft, and \\"architecture\\" is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft. Filmmaking Filmmaking is the process of making a motion-picture, from an initial conception and research, through scriptwriting, shooting and recording, animation or other special effects, editing, sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience; it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films, embracing documentary, strains of theatre and literature in film, and poetic or experimental practices, and is often used to refer to video-based processes as well Computer art Maurizio Bolognini, Sealed Computers (Nice, 1997). This conceptual art installation uses computer codes to create endless flows of random images which will never be accessible for viewing.Images are continuously generated by the computers, but they are prevented from becoming a physical artwork: Andreas Broeckmann, \\"Image, Process, Performance, Machine: Aspects of an Aesthetics of the Machinic\\", in , pp. 204-205. Visual artists are no longer limited to traditional Visual arts media. Computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the 1960s. Uses include the capturing or creating of images and forms, the editing of those images and forms (including exploring multiple compositions) and the final rendering or printing (including 3D printing). Computer art is any in which computers played a role in production or display. Such art can be an image, sound, animation, video, CD-ROM, DVD, video game, website, algorithm, performance or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating digital technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers have been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithmic art and other digital techniques. As a result, defining computer art by its end product can be difficult. Nevertheless, this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits, though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting. On the other hand, there are computer-based artworks which belong to a new conceptual and postdigital strand, assuming the same technologies, and their social impact, as an object of inquiry. Computer usage has blurred the distinctions between illustrators, photographers, photo editors, 3-D modelers, and handicraft artists. Sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi-skilled image developers. Photographers may become digital artists. Illustrators may become animators. Handicraft may be computer-aided or use computer-generated imagery as a template. Computer clip art usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and page layout less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of paginating a document, especially to the unskilled observer. Plastic arts Plastic arts is a term for art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics. The term has also been applied to all the visual (non-literary, non-musical) arts.Art Terminology at KSU Materials that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete or steel, have also been included in the narrower definition, since, with appropriate tools, such materials are also capable of modulation. This use of the term \\"plastic\\" in the arts should not be confused with Piet Mondrian's use, nor with the movement he termed, in French and English, \\"Neoplasticism.\\" =Sculpture= Sculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard or plastic material, sound, or text and or light, commonly stone (either rock or marble), clay, metal, glass, or wood. Some sculptures are created directly by finding or carving; others are assembled, built together and fired, welded, molded, or cast. Sculptures are often painted.Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity 22 September 2007 Through 20 January 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the plastic arts. The majority of public art is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden. Sculptors do not always make sculptures by hand. With increasing technology in the 20th century and the popularity of conceptual art over technical mastery, more sculptors turned to art fabricators to produce their artworks. With fabrication, the artist creates a design and pays a fabricator to produce it. This allows sculptors to create larger and more complex sculptures out of material like cement, metal and plastic, that they would not be able to create by hand. Sculptures can also be made with 3-d printing technology. US copyright definition of visual art In the United States, the law protecting the copyright over a piece of visual art gives a more restrictive definition of \\"visual art\\". > A \\"work of visual art\\" is ‚Äî > (1) a painting, drawing, print or sculpture, existing in a single copy, in a > limited edition of 200 copies or fewer that are signed and consecutively > numbered by the author, or, in the case of a sculpture, in multiple cast, > carved, or fabricated sculptures of 200 or fewer that are consecutively > numbered by the author and bear the signature or other identifying mark of > the author; or > (2) a still photographic image produced for exhibition purposes only, > existing in a single copy that is signed by the author, or in a limited > edition of 200 copies or fewer that are signed and consecutively numbered by > the author. > > A work of visual art does not include ‚Äî > (A)(i) any poster, map, globe, chart, technical drawing, diagram, model, > applied art, motion picture or other audiovisual work, book, magazine, > newspaper, periodical, data base, electronic information service, electronic > publication, or similar publication; > (ii) any merchandising item or advertising, promotional, descriptive, > covering, or packaging material or container; > (iii) any portion or part of any item described in clause (i) or (ii); > (B) any work made for hire; or > (C) any work not subject to copyright protection under this title.

Description The site consists of grassy woodlands, much of which is grazed by sheep, west of the town of Warwick in the Nandewar bioregion. It is defined as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the recent occurrence of regent honeyeaters, and includes the McIntyre and Durikai state forests and the upper catchment of McIntyre Brook. It lies in the upper Murray-Darling basin not far from the state border with New South Wales. The two state forests contain areas of selectively logged eucalypt forest and woodlands with spotted gum and box‚Äìironbark plant communities. Geologically, the area is mostly rocky, metamorphosed sedimentaries and interbedded volcanics with infertile soils that are not suitable for agriculture. Over 500 km2 of the land in the IBA is owned by a few major private landowners, with the remainder being state forest.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Traprock. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-11-13. Birds The site has been identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports a small, regularly breeding population of endangered regent honeyeaters, as well as significant populations of diamond firetails at the northern end of their range. Other birds of conservation concern found in the IBA are glossy black cockatoos, turquoise parrots, black-chinned honeyeaters, powerful owls, hooded robins, grey-crowned babblers and speckled warblers. Other animals found in the IBA that are listed as threatened under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992 include the border thick-tailed gecko and little pied bat.

Formed in autumn 2001, the group is known for its practice of basing each song on a well-known quotation. Many of the band's lyrics and all of the album covers center on the story of an old man, a cult figure called Wiseman. Biography Wisdom - Early days Keep Wiseman Alive 2013 Wisdom on stage in 2013 The band originally consisted of bass player Mate Molnar and guitarist Gabor Kovacs. Molnar was a fan of Kovacs' existing band Legendary, and the two agreed to form a new group together. They were later joined by Istvan Nachladal (Nahi) (vocals), Balazs Hornyak (drums) and Zsolt Galambos (guitar), who had also been a member of Legendary. The band was named after the 1986 film Wisdom. Wisdom played their first concert in Miskolc in 2002. In they were featured as a support act in the 2003 Iron Maiden tour Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour. They subsequently featured in the motorcycle magazine Born To Be Wild, which led to increased public exposure. Wisdom performed as a warm-up act for Saxon and were the support act for the UDO-Doro tour. Whilst on this tour the band was noticed by Ronny Milianowicz of Swedish/German band Dionysus, who arranged a record company offer which would release the first Wisdom record, a four-track single titled Wisdom EP released in July 2004. It was circulated as a free CD with the Hungarian music magazine Metal Hammer. During the process of recording, Hornyak left the group and was replaced by Csaba Czebely. After the release of the EP, Wisdom supported Europe and in early 2005 toured with the band Ossian. Molnar wanted to build up a narrative world around the name Wisdom, based on Iron Maiden's Eddie or Megadeth's Vic. During the course of recording their first album, graphic designer Gyula Havancsak (Hjules) created the figure of Wiseman, who became the band's mascot. Each subsequent record released by Wisdom contained references to the character's biography. The band's first independent concert was held on 19 November 2005 in Budapest, and was called Keep Wiseman Alive. Originally a one-off gig, Keep Wiseman Alive ultimately evolved into an annual event. In 2006 Wisdom played as a warm up act for Helloween. In 2006 the band's first LP, Words of Wisdom, was released under Hammer Records. Peter Kern had by this point replaced Csaba Czebely as the band's drummer. The album was mastered at Finnvox studios. Wisdom then signed to Soundholic Records for the album's Asian release. Wisdom was nominated as a contender for Hungary's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, although they were not selected. In the spring of 2007, Wisdom embarked on a tour for the promotion of their own record, and also opened for Heaven and Hell at the Sziget Festival. During the tour, Nachladal left the band; Zoltan Kiss replaced him on vocals for their remaining concerts. After the release of the single \\"At The Gate\\"', the band took a hiatus from performing. Kern left the band due to health issues and was replaced on drums by Balazs Agota. After two years, Wisdom returned to performing, playing as the opening act for Judas Priest. The band recruited new vocalist Gabor Nagy in 2010 and released a new studio album, Judas, in April 2011. In order to promote the new album, Wisdom went on to tour in the fall of 2010; Nagy wore a mask for all the gig appearances as a promotional stunt. The album featured Mats Lev√©n (Therion and Malmsteen as guest vocalists. Japan's Spinning Records and United States' CD InZane LLC subsequently released Judas. In autumn the band shot a new video for a track called \\"Heaven and Hell\\". The shooting took place Festetics family's castle of D√©g. At this time the band celebrated its 10th anniversary with a tour they named Wise Years, which concluded with their annual Keep Wiseman Alive concert in Budapest. In 2012 the band were signed by booking agency Rock the Nation and record company Noise Art Records. Galambos was replaced on guitar by Mate Bodor. In August the album Judas was released worldwide, and to promote it the band joined Sabaton on their Swedish Empire Tour. On 27 September 2013, the band's third album was released titled Marching For Liberty. It was distributed internationally through NoiseArt records. The album entered the official Hungarian Album Charts (Mahasz) at number 1. Fabio Lione (Rhapsody, Vision Divine, Kamelot Angra) sang several parts in the title song. Immediately after the new release, the band started touring in Western Europe alongside Powerwolf. At the 7th annual Keep Wiseman Alive show, Powerwolf performed as the guest act. On 1 April 2018 the band announced that they were splitting up. Nevertheless, they still planned to record and release a fifth studio album.Wisdom's official website Band members ;Final lineup * Gabor Nagy - lead vocals (2010‚Äì2018) * Gabor Kovacs - guitar, backing vocals (2001‚Äì2018) * Anton Kabanen - guitar (2015‚Äì2018) * Mate Molnar - bass guitar (2001‚Äì2018) * Tam√°s T√≥th - drums (2014‚Äì2018) ;Former members * Balazs Agota - drums (2008‚Äì2014) * Mate Bodor - guitar (2012‚Äì2015) * Zsolt Galambos - guitar (2001‚Äì2012) * Istvan Nachladal - lead vocals (2001‚Äì2007) * Peter Kern - drums (2006‚Äì2008) * Csaba Czebely - drums (2004‚Äì2005) * Balazs Hornyak - drums (2001‚Äì2003) Timeline Discography * Wisdom EP (2004) * Words of Wisdom (2006) * At the Gates EP (2007) * Judas (2011) * Marching for Liberty (2013) * Rise of the Wise (2016) References External links * Category:Hungarian heavy metal musical groups ","title":"Wisdom (band)"},{"id":"33734570","text":"Pi Cheon-deuk (hangul: ÌîºÏ≤úÎìù, hanja: ÁöÆÂçÉÂæó, nom de plume: Geuma; April 21, 1910 - May 25, 2007) was a Korean poet and an English literature scholar, but primarily an essayist.\\"Pi Chunduk\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Life Born in Seoul on April 21, 1910, his pen name was Geuma.\\"Pi Chunduk\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# He majored in English literature at Hujiang University (formally University of Shanghai)Hujiang University (1906‚Äì1952) was merged later into East China Normal University. in Shanghai.

He started his literary pursuits in 1930, publishing the poem \\"Seojungsogok\\" in magazine Sindonga. His first collection of poems Lyrical Poetical Works was well-received as a simple and beautiful poem describing nature and the heart. Though a famous writer, he was known as a plain, free and easy person. He lived among books in a small apartment. His grandson is the American violinist Stefan Jackiw. Work Pi's major works are A Piece of Silver Coin and Affinity. Pi initially established himself as a poet with the publication of his poem \\"Seojeongsogok\\" (Short Lyrical Piece) in Shindong-a (New Dong-a) in 1930, followed by the publication of \\"sogok\\" (Musical Sketch) and \\"Gasin nim\\" (My Lover Has Gone). The distinguishing feature of his poetry is its that it excludes all ideas and thoughts and praises the beauty of pure emotion. He also published various essays, including \\"Nunborachineun bamui chueok\\" (Memory of a Snowy Night), \\"Gidarineun pyeonji\\" (The Waiting Letter), \\"Muje\\" (Untitled), and \\"Naui pail\\" (My File). Generally, through a clear and consistent delineation of feeling, he portrayed a life overflowing with a poetic sentiment based on a pure sentiment that excludes all thoughts, idea, and subjects. Because his essays are beautifully express the emotions of everyday life through an intimate and delicate style, they tend to read like prosaic lyric poetry. Thus, his essays are regarded as representative works of the lyrical-contemplative essay. In 1947 he gathered all his works that lyrically sang of nature and a childlike heart and published the anthology Seojeongsijip (Collection of Lyrical Poetry). In his 1969 anthology, Sanhowa jinju (Coral and Pearl), he expressed his unattainable aspiration through the metaphor of the coral and pearl, contributing a beautiful and lyrical poem and essay. His \\"Supil\\" (Essay), a piece on essay theory written in the form of an essay, deals with the nature and characteristics of the essay. He also published works on English literature such as \\"Ellijabeseujoui gyususiin\\" (Elizabethan Female Poets) and \\"Seikseupieoui soneteu\\" (Shakespeare's Sonnets).

At the end of the season he was retired to stud but he had little success before or after being exported to Argentina in 1951. Background My Love was bred in France by his original owner Leon Volterra, who later sold a half share in the colt to the Aga Khan. The colt was trained at Chantilly by Richard ‚ÄúDick‚Äù Carver an Englishman whose family had been based in France for many years. Carver had never been to Epsom before My Love ran in the 1948 Derby. My Love‚Äôs sire, Vatellor was a high class racehorse who won eight races in France including the race now called the Prix Jean Prat. He later became a successful stallion being Champion sire in France in 1956 and getting such notable performers as Pearl Diver, Nikellora (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) and Vattel (Grand Prix de Paris). My Love‚Äôs dam, For My Love was bred by Volterra and won two small races, but produced no other horses of importance. Racing career =1947: two-year-old season= My Love provided little evidence of potential as a two-year-old in 1948. He ran twice without winning, although he was beaten only a head on his debut. =1948: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1948, My Love ran in the major French middle-distance trial races (Poules des Produits). In April he finished second to Flush Royal in the Prix Noailles over 2200m at Longchamp and then finished third to Rigolo and Flush Royal in the Prix Greffulhe. At this point in the season, My Love was not considered a serious Derby contender and was available at odds of 100/1. On his next start on May 9 he was moved up in distance for the Prix Hocquart over 2400m and showed improved form, winning in \\"brilliant\\" style from Turmoil and Flush Royal. Shortly after the race the Aga Khan, reportedly acting on the advice of My Love‚Äôs Australian jockey Rae Johnstone, bought a half share in the colt for ¬£15,000. At Epsom My Love started at 100/9 (approximately 11/1) in a field of thirty-two runners, the largest since 1862. The 2000 Guineas winner My Babu started favourite at 7/2, in front of a crowd estimated at up to 1,000,000 which included the King and the Prime Minister. My Love was held up at the back of the field by Rae Johnstone in the early stages as Tory II made the running. Turning into the straight the French-trained Royal Drake overtook the leader and went clear. Johnstone switched My Love to the outside and the colt produced what was described as a \\"brilliant burst of speed\\" to catch Royal Drake well inside the final furlong and win by one and a half lengths with Noor four lengths further back in third. The second and third placed horses were owned by Volterra and the Aga Khan respectively. At the end of June My Love returned to Longchamp for the Grand Prix de Paris, at that time the most valuable race in France ($16,800), for which he was made 2/1 favourite. As at Epsom, he was held up at the rear of the field in the early running before making a \\"terrific run\\" in the straight. He became the first horse since Spearmint in 1906 to complete the Derby-Grand Prix double, beating Flush Royal by a length with the Prix du Jockey Club winner Bey in third. In September attempted to complete a unique treble by adding the St Leger at Doncaster. He was strongly fancied in the build-up to the race, with Noor and the improving American-bred Black Tarquin being seen as his most serious rivals. My Love started favourite for a race which, with a prize of ¬£15,368, was the most valuable ever run in Britain but finished unplaced behind Black Tarquin and Alycidon. My Love was then retired to stud. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated My Love an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù Derby winner. Stud career My Love was based in France for his first three seasons at stud, but the foals he sired in Europe made little impact. He was sold to the Argentinian government in 1951, exported and auctioned in Buenos Aires where he fetched a sum of ¬£46,250. The date of My Love‚Äôs death is not recorded, but his last foals would appear to have been conceived in either 1962 or 1963.http://www.pedigreequery.com/progeny/my+love Pedigree *My Love was inbred 3x4 to Teddy.

Played by Lisa Lewis, the character appeared for a period of six years between 1983 and 1989. Shirley became the programme's first regular black character. Shirley Armitage was a machinist at Baldwin's Casuals. From 1988 to 1989, she lived with Curly Watts in the shop flat but left the area when they split up. Biography Shirley Armitage started work at denim factory Baldwin's Casuals in September 1983. Shirley came from a big family, with nine living in the same house. At the factory, Shirley was one of the youngest machinists and usually stayed quiet while the louder personalities, chiefly Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) and Ida Clough (Helene Palmer), led the gossip. She occasionally spoke up to back the girls against Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), for example when she favoured a strike when Mike announced that some of the staffs' jobs would be at risk because of a new computer system at the factory in July 1984. In 1985, Shirley chatted to Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) at a dance at the Community Centre and let him walk her home afterwards. Curly was shy about asking her out but they hit it off and Curly later chatted her up at Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Sally Webster's (Sally Dynevor) flatwarming party in August 1987. They started seeing each other on a casual basis after that. By 1986, Shirley was getting sick of living in such a crowded home and decided to ask Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) if she could rent the shop flat as the Websters had moved into No.13. Alf asked for a reference but in the time it took her to get one from Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), Curly also made enquiries about the flat and Alf agreed he could move in. When Shirley and Curly compared notes, they were puzzled as Curly hadn't been asked for a reference. Thinking Alf racist, Curly decided to refuse the flat but Shirley suggested they move in together. Curly agreed and Alf backed down when Emily threatened to tell people about his racism. The unexpected move marked a big change in Shirley's and Curly's lives, as well as their relationship, with Shirley becoming the first woman Curly had ever slept with. Their next obstacle was winning over each other's families, no easy task as despite the race issue, Shirley's parents disapproved of her living in sin. Eventually, Mrs Armitage was convinced that Curly loved Shirley but his parents never accepted Shirley. Mrs Armitage was accepting enough to let Shirley's younger sister, Lucy, stay with the couple for a few weeks in August. Later that year, Curly enrolled in a business studies course at college. Shirley wasn't convinced it would be a good move as that would make Shirley the sole earner while he studied but she admired his ability and caused a stir at work by showing them Curly's essay on Mike making the machinists work in terrible Victorian conditions. Mike insisted Curly give it to him, threatening to sack Shirley otherwise. Curly's new career was to split the couple up. In April 1989, Shirley threw a surprise party to celebrate their first anniversary but Curly promptly threw everyone out as he had an important exam the next day. Shirley realised that Curly was too serious for her and decided to move back in with her parents. Desperate to stop Shirley leaving, Curly broke down and proposed marriage, promising to change, but Shirley knew that the relationship had run its course and left. Shirley left Baldwin's Casuals, a week after splitting up with Curly and moved to Gorton.

Also: Kemanke≈ü Mustafa Pa≈üa C√¢m√Æi) was an Ottoman mosque in Istanbul.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 188. The building was originally a Byzantine-era Eastern Orthodox church of unknown dedication. In 1475, after the Fall of Constantinople (1453), it became a Roman Catholic church, dedicated to Saint Mary of Constantinople, until finally it was converted into a mosque by the Ottomans in 1640. The mosque was destroyed by fire in 1919, and since then has fallen into ruin. As of 2011, only some walls remain, hidden among modern buildings. Location The ruins of the building lie in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood of Salmatomruk, not far from Edirne Kapƒ± (the ancient Gate of Charisius), more or less halfway between the Chora Church and the Fethiye Mosque.Westphalen (1998), p. 1. The few remains lie in a courtyard and can be accessed through modern blocks built on M√ºftu Sokaƒùi 20-22. History =Byzantine Age= Between the ninth and the tenth centuryWestphalen (1998) p.40 a church with an underlying basement and a crypt was erected on the top of the sixth hill of Constantinople, on a plateau which is limited by the open air cistern of Aetius (now a football field) and by the unidentified Byzantine edifice denominated in Ottoman times as Boƒùdan Saray. The dedication of this building is uncertain, but it was probably part of a complex which also included today's Kasƒ±m Aƒüa Mosque and the ƒ∞pek Cistern, and was almost certainly the katholikon of a monastery. The edifice has been identified for a long time as the Theotokos en te Petra, but without conclusive evidence.Eyice (1955) p.72 During the Byzantine period, several monasteries lay in the area; the Monastery of Manuel, that devoted to St. John in Petra, and the Kecharitomene nunnery (\\"full of grace\\" or \\"favoured (by God)\\"). The latter was founded at the beginning of the 12th century by Empress Eirene Doukaina, and is known above all because of its detailed and extant typikon.Janin (1953), p. 196. The nearby church of the Theotokos tes Kellararias, used by the nuns of the Kecharitomene as a burial place, and that of Hagios Nikolaos, both mentioned in the typikon of the nunnery, are possible candidates for the identification.Westphalen (1998), p. 2. Moreover, the Odalar Mosque could also be identified with a nearby church dedicated to Saints Sergius and Bacchus, which lay \\"near the cistern of Aetios\\": not to be confounded with the homonymous church which lies near Hagia Sophia) because of the discovery in the vicinity of a monogrammed capital (unfortunately found not in situ).Janin (1953), p. 559. Between 1150 and 1175 a new church of the cross-in-square plan was built above the old one (possibly destroyed by fire or menaced by a landslide).Westphalen (1998) p.43 =Ottoman Age= The Genoese Fortress of Caffa. From here were deported the Italians which populated the Kefeli Mahalle in Istanbul The documented history of the edifice begins in 1475, shortly after the Fall of Constantinople, when Sultan Mehmed II conquered the Genoese colony of Caffa, in Crimea. About 40,000 Latin, Greek, Armenian and Jewish inhabitants who lived in Caffa (\\"Caffariotes\\" or, in Turkish, Kefeli) were then deported to Istanbul and relocated to this quarter, which was named after them Kefe Mahallesi.Mamboury 1953) p. 308 The Latins, mainly Genoese, were authorized to use in their quarter as churches the building and, together with the Armenians, another edifice known later as Kefeli Mosque, which was dedicated to Saint Nicholas. The edifice, dedicated then to Saint Mary of Constantinople (), was officiated by the Dominicans, which before the Ottoman conquest had also a monastery in the city on the Black Sea.Westphalen (1998), p. 48. Here was brought from Caffa a large icon of the Hodegetria type, which now is kept in the Dominican monastery of SS. Peter and Paul in Galata. Due to all that, at the beginning of the sixteenth century the church of Saint Mary had turned into the center of this quarter predominantly inhabited by Italians, but the building fell soon in disrepair. Under Sultan Murad IV (r. 1623‚Äì1640) the decision was taken to exclude from the walled city the Christians who were not Ottoman subjects and to resettle them in Galata and Pera.Westphalen (1998), p. 49. As a consequence, and after riots between Christian and Muslims, the church was closed in 1636, and in 1640 it was transformed into a mosque by Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) Kemanke≈ü Mustafa Pasha (d. 1644).G√ºlersoy (1976) p. 249. As mentioned above, only the Hodegetria Icon could be moved with great difficulties to Galata. After the relocation of the married Janissaries in the quarter in 1782, the mosque got the appellation of Odalar (In Turkish \\"Oda\\" means \\"room\\" but also \\"barrack of the Janissaries\\"). Previously these were lodged at the Eski Odalar (\\"Old Barracks\\") near ≈ûehzade Mosque, which were destroyed in the fire of 1782. The building decayed steadily (by the mid-19th century the dome had collapsed), and it was heavily damaged by the fire of Salmatomruk on 2 July 1919. When the quarter was rebuilt with modern criteria the edifice was not restored, and fell into ruin. Architecture As mentioned above, several constructive phases can be recognized in the building during the Byzantine period. The first church, erected in the middle Byzantine age, had an almost square plan (about 11.65 m x 10 m ) with three apses, and was oriented toward the East. In 1935, only the tripartite sanctuary and the Bema were still visible.Westphalen (1998) p. 37 The church was built on a basement composed of 24 vaulted rooms and a vaulted crypt with an apse, which is supposed to have been a chapel containing relics.Westphalen (1998) p. 24 These rooms had at first a profane usage, later they were used as burial place and finally as a cistern.Westphalen (1998) p. 47 The second church, erected at the end of the twelfth century, used also 16 small rooms of the abandoned first church's basement as substructure. The masonry was made of stone and bricks, and was erected with the technique of the recessed brick,Janin (1953), p. 560.Westphalen (1998) p. 53Westphalen (1998) p. 78 typical of the Byzantine architecture of the middle period.Krautheimer (1986), p. 400. Another example of edifices of Constantinople where this technique was used is the mosque of Eski Imaret In this technique, alternate courses of bricks are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged in a mortar's bed. Due to that, the thickness of the mortar layers is about three times greater than that of the bricks layers. In this building, three or four rows of bricks alternate with single rows of stones, and the bricks are arranged to form several patterns. The second church was of the cross-in-square type with an almost square naos about 10.5 m wide: it had four columns sustaining the dome through pendentives, three apses - the central one having a polygonal shape - and a narthex embracing the edifice on the west and north sides.Westphalen (1998) p. 52 The dome was about 4.4. m wide, lay on a drum and was adorned with frescoes. East of the naos lay a tripartite sanctuary composed of a bema flanked by a prothesis and a diakonikon.Westphalen (1998) p. 60 The floor of the new church was 3.3 m above that of the first church. The edifice can be described as a middle-sized Byzantine church, similar to the nearby Church of Christ Pantepoptes.Westphalen (1998) p. 67 From a relation of Pietro Demarchis, bishop of Santorini, who visited Istanbul in 1622, we know that at that time the columns of the church had been taken away by the Turks and substituted with wooden pillars, and that the dome was covered with frescoes. Moreover, part of the building was already menacing ruin. Just after the conversion to mosque, to the building were added a mihrab, a minbar and a minaret. After the fire of 1919, the building fell into ruin (the roof collapsed and the minaret crashed already in the 1820s), but luckily it was thoroughly studied and surveyed by the German Archaeologist Paul Schatzmann in 1934/1935.Westphalen (1998), p. 5. According to the Greek scholar Alexandros G. Paspates, in the East part of the basement of the Mosque sprung a water source (, , ) dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, abandoned for a long time. Paintings During the excavation of 1934/1935 up to four mortar layers covered with frescoes on blue background were uncovered. A fresco representing a Madonna on Throne with angels was found in the crypt. In the basement rooms were found fragments of paintings having as subject funerary themes.Westphalen (1998) p. 85 In the inferior church were discovered two deesis, a fresco representing the soldier Saint Mercurius - of unparalleled technique among the known Byzantine works of this age - and prophets. These paintings were executed either in the tenth or in the middle of the eleventh century, belonging so to the first church. The diakonikon of the second church was adorned with frescoes showing saints and episodes of the Life of the Virgin. The best preserved frescoes (among them Saint Mercurius) were detached, restored and are on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.

It took place in the industrial regions located in Halle, Leuna, Merseburg, and Mansfeld. The revolt ended in defeat for the Communists, and a weakening of contemporary Communist influence in Germany.  Background  The precarious economic situation in Germany the early 1920s exacerbated widespread social discontent, especially among industrial workers. This led to left-wing parties becoming very popular in industrial areas. The KPD became the strongest party in the elections to the Prussian state parliament on February 20, 1921 in the Halle- Merseburg constituency, winning almost 30 percent of the vote. In the Central German industrial area, where lignite mining and the chemical industry dominated, there had been continued strikes, clashes between workers and the police, and theft in factories and farms since the L√ºttwitz-Kapp putsch of March 1920. All attempts to prevent such property offences by the Werkspolizei, including body searches and stricter surveillance, failed. The province of Saxony also worried the Prussian state government because there were still numerous weapons in the hands of the workers that could not be confiscated after the suppression of the March uprisings of 1920. In addition, a failed bomb attack on the Berlin Victory Column on 13 March, 1921 had been traced to Saxony. This prompted the Prussian Minister of the Interior Carl Severing and the President of the Prussian Province of Saxony, Otto H√∂rsing (1874-1937), to intervene in the Central German industrial area. On 19 March, 1921, police were sent to Mansfeld and Eisleben to restore \\"order and security\\". Events The leadership of the KPD, which had long been seeking pretexts for the violent overthrow of the hated Weimar parliamentary democracy, hoped for a spontaneous uprising of the workers in Central Germany in response to the intervention of state power there. Revolutionary actions were to be initiated primarily through propaganda in the party newspaper \\"Rote Fahne\\" (Red Flag). The workers initially behaved cautiously. Despite the call from the KPD district leadership for a general strike on March 21, work continued in most companies outside the district of Mansfeld. Only on the following day did the work stoppages in the mining area Mansfeld-Eisleben expand. With the arrival of the KAPD member Max Hoelz, who had already emerged as a violent and radical 'leader in the 1919/1920 workers' unrest in the Vogtland region, the strike movement escalated into a violent insurrection. Hoelz spoke at various strike assemblies and called on the workers to violently resist the police. The first violent attacks on police officers in Eisleben occurred during 22 March. Hoelz began to equip striking workers and unemployed miners with weapons and organise them into raiding parties, which subjected the area around Mansfeld, Eisleben and Hettstedt to arson, looting, bank robbery and explosives attacks. Trains were derailed and railway lines blown up. The KPD district leadership in Halle increasingly lost control of the armed workers due to the instigation of violence by Hoelz. The uprising movement also threatened to spread to the Free State of Saxony, where unsuccessful bombings against justice buildings in Dresden, Leipzig and Freiberg had occurred. Bloody clashes between workers and police also occurred in Hamburg, where the Senate had to impose a state of emergency on the city. Against this background, on March 24 Reich President Friedrich Ebert declared a non-military state of emergency for Hamburg and the province of Saxony, on the basis of Article 48 of the Imperial Constitution. On the same day, the KPD proclaimed a general strike throughout the empire, which, however, failed to materialise. Solidarity strikes only occurred in Lusatia, parts of the Ruhr area and Thuringia. In Hamburg, unemployed people occupying some shipyards had violent clashes with the police. In the Central German industrial area, after the presidential decree became known, the fighting intensified, now also splilling over to Halle, Merseburg, Wittenberg, Delitzsch and Bitterfeld. However, the government troops managed to gain the upper hand and at the end of March the uprisings were finally suppressed. The Leuna works was a particularly strong bastion of influence of KAPD, where half of the 20,000 strong workforce belonged to their associated workplace organisation, the General Workers' Union of Germany (AAUD). During the revolt they fought with rifles and automatic weapons. They also built their own tank, which they deployed against the police.David Priestland. The Red Flag: A History of Communism.

In 2005, the trio had been playing live and working with different member setups when they started working with independent record label producer Kenichi Tateiwa of Basis Records, who suggested they add Takehiro Shimizu on drums to the line up. Shimizu joined the band in the months leading up to the recording of their first album, DEMONSTRATION, in August 2005. Shimizu currently (November, 2011) divides his time between Osaka, Japan, and New York City. Indigo Jam Unit is often grouped together with other bands from the Japanese jazz and nu jazz scene, such as Quasimode, Soil & \\"Pimp\\" Sessions, and Sleepwalker among others. Indigo Jam Unit have distinguished themselves with a twin drum line up where Shimizu contributes the jazzier rhythms and drum solos while Wasano adds a heavier straight beat and percussion. Indigo Jam Unit always record their material live in the studio with little post processing and as few effects as possible. No edits or overdubs are made to their recordings. The only exception is their 2009 release re:common on Rambling Records, featuring American hip-hop artist Common and hip-hop/soul artist Mary J. Blige's original voice tracks with indigo jam unit's instrumental tracks added separately. Indigo Jam Unit have recorded and performed together with Japanese jazz vocalist Karen Aoki (SUMMERTIME feat.

Taxation =Background= The state Government of Punjab, India has embarked on reform program to modernise its tax administration. The key focus is on improving operational efficiency, enabling voluntary compliance and enhancing tax payer's convenience. The Department has already implemented the project on computerisation of VAT Information System (COVIS) which included designing of a statewide I.T. infrastructure with the central server at Patiala. All Excise and Taxation district offices are linked with the Central Server through leased-lines and V-Sat and formulation of centralised data base. The Department has engaged Ernst & Young as I.T. auditors and CORBUS as Application Software Developer for the Department. The Department has a separate agency known as Excise & Taxation Technical Services Agency (ETTSA) to look after the technical and other modernisation related issued of the department. Current auditor for ETTSA is PWC, but CORBUS is working for ETTSA from 2000 to till date as an application software developer. =Goals= There has been a strong demand for streamlining VAT administration through citizen- centric, service-oriented processes, and establishing a certain degree of standardisation with respect to Commercial Tax (CT) administration. Since the CT departments mainly interface with businesses and often account for 60‚àí70 per cent of the total revenue of the States and Union Territories (UTs), their functioning can directly affect the attractiveness of a State or UT as a business destination. It is against this backdrop that the Commercial Taxes MMP was conceived. The initiative is spearheaded by the Department of Revenue (DoR), Ministry of Finance, with strategic consultancy provided by the National Institute for Smart Government (NISG) and Ernst & Young (E &Y;). Under this MMP, various recommendations have been made to facilitate simplification of administrative procedures and reduction of processing timelines. Some of the key recommendations are noted below: * Electronic filing of returns * Electronic clearance of refunds * Electronic payment of tax * Online dealer ledger * Online issuance of CST statutory forms through Tax Information Exchange System (TINXSYS) * Facility to dealer to obtain various online information services =Computerisation wing= ETTSA (Excise and Taxation Technical Services Agency) government of Punjab is an autonomous body working primarily towards computerisation and automation of the Excise and Taxation Department of the Punjab State Government. ETTSA works at 99 locations spanning the length and breadth of Punjab. These 99 locations house about 2500 users who are connected through a hybrid WAN network consisting of Leased Lines and VSATs. The central server is a UNIX RISC Central Server and there are 25 other Intel-based Application Servers. All the ETTSA users are on Thin Clients and to support them the organisation has got 15 Citrix Servers. There are 36 nodal Information Collection Centres (ICC) situated at the interstate borders which collect information on interstate trade. Information about any transaction made from the state of Punjab to other states and vice versa is collected online. When a Truck reaches the interstate border, the information about it is given to the ICC. Then ETTSA generates a statutory form ‚Äî a Pass for the truck ‚Äî to enter Punjab. Land records digitization Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana is making land records of Punjab online available and helping in online registration of land registry.

When an argument ensues, Barney storms out and Ted attempts to apologize the next day, but is surprised to see Barney with a baby. While Ted is worried about where the baby came from, he is swayed into keeping her when he notices how much female attention he and Barney attract with her. Marshall and Lily drop by the house they were given by her grandparents in Long Island, which they are planning to sell. After returning to their New York City apartment, they perceive it to be much smaller than before, and they decide to move to the Long Island house. When Robin learns of their decision, she is shocked and afraid of losing \\"the gang\\". In an effort to change their minds, she reminds them of the time when Marshall almost purchased an abandoned fire-house and became a Ghostbuster after encountering the signs: the ambulance, the firehouse, and Ernie Hudson. When the three arrive at the house to prepare for Thanksgiving, Robin locks herself in their bathroom and refuses to leave until they change their minds. Marshall soon becomes worried about her and knocks on the bathroom window to find out what is going on and why she is not reacting well to the thought of him and Lily moving. Robin says \\"Maybe I need you guys more than you think.\\" When Marshall asks if this is about more than them moving, she does not respond. When Barney and Ted arrive at Marshall and Lily's house with the baby, Lily is shocked. She manages to convince Ted this is not a good idea. Barney's brother, James, and his husband arrive, and the child is their daughter, Sadie, who Barney offered to babysit after inviting James and his family for Thanksgiving. James tells Ted he almost adopted a baby with a female friend, but once they met their life partners, they were both happy that they had not followed through with the plan. Ted tells Barney that he no longer wishes to adopt, saying that they need to find their soulmates first before they can think about having kids. Barney leaves to take a walk, but when he realizes Robin is in the bathroom, he goes to the window to talk to her. Robin then blurts out that she is pregnant. Critical response The A.V.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History Zug Castle The first castle on the site was probably a wooden manor house built around 1000 and owned by a ministerialis family in service to either the Counts of Aargau or of Lenzburg. Based on archeological excavations, it was built on an island between two small streams and surrounded by a wooden palisade. While the local nobleman occupied the house and island, his men built a village along the streams. Later the streams were dammed to prevent flooding.Swiss Castles.ch retrieved 15 February 2016 Around the end of the 11th century, the original house expanded. A tall stone wall was built around the house. However all the buildings inside the wall remained wooden. According to tradition, the castle was attacked and damaged during the 12th century. In the 13th century, Zug came under the control of the Kyburgs. They founded the city of Zug (around 1200) and had the ruined castle was rebuilt in stone. A tower with thick first story walls was built. The walls taper slightly and upper story walls are only about thick to a height of . The tower was surrounded by two semi-circular walls to the north and east. By the end of the 13th century the town was surrounded by an, up to high, wall and additional defensive works. When the Kyburg family died out in 1264, the city and castle of Zug were inherited by the Habsburgs. The castle living quarters were expanded and a number of buildings were added between the tower and city wall. After the Habsburg defeat at the Battle of Morgarten in 1315, Zug became a Habsburg stronghold in an increasing hostile Swiss Confederation. The surrounding cities of Zurich, Lucerne and Glarus joined the Confederation and the nearby villages began to side with the Swiss, however, Zug city remained strongly tied to the Habsburgs. When the Confederation invaded Zug, the surrounding villages immediately surrendered. After a two-week siege, Zug Castle and city fell to the Swiss. The castle was not damaged in the siege and became a Confederation castle. After Zug joined the Confederation as a full member, the castle gradually lost its importance. Around 1555 Johannes Zurlauben had the old wall demolished and a decorative wall built around the castle. He had a half-timbered structure built on the west side of the tower. In the 16th century the old Habsburg living quarters were expanded and connected to the Zurlauben structure. Present Day The castle was purchased by the municipality of Zug in 1945 from the Hediger family and later renovated in 1982. Recently, the castle contained the Zug town and cantonal museum's permanent collection along with other exhibits. In 2012, the museum was closed for refurbishment and re-opened in November 2013 with a new permanent collection.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. It is the only remaining intact water castle in eastern Switzerland. History Hagenwil Castle in 1912 The first mention of the castle is in 1264 when Rudolf von Hagenwil donated it to the Abbey of St. Gall. The donation was made in gratitude to the Abbot of St. Gall for rescuing Rudolf from his sons in law, who were holding him prisoner at Heitnau Castle in an attempt to receive their inheritance early. The donation included the right for Rudolf and his family to continue occupying the castle. After his son Ulrich died childless, the title to the castle transferred fully to the Abbey. The next time the castle is mentioned, in 1341, it was the fief of Hermann von Breitenlandenberg. During the Appenzell Wars, in 1405, an Appenzell army marched through the Hagenwil area. While there is no record of an attack, the stone walls show evidence of a massive fire and many wooden beams date to between 1414 and 1425, indicating that the castle was probably damaged. In 1407 the castle and village were inherited by Konrad and Ulrich Paygrer. Konrad Paygrer died in 1446, and his widow quickly remarried. Her new husband, Burkhard Schenk von Castell, bought out the shares of the remaining heirs. However, in 1470, Jakob Paygrer bought Hagenwil back from his stepfather. When he died in 1504, his sons in law, Jakob von Reinach and Wilhelm von Bernhausen inherited the estates. The castle remained with the Bernhausen family for about 180 years. During the Protestant Reformation the village of Hagenwil converted to the new faith in 1529. However, in 1536 they converted back to the Roman Catholic Church. During the Thirty Years War, on 6 September 1633, the castle was attacked and captured by a Swedish army, though it only suffered minor damage. The last Bernhausen owner of the castle was a Lieutenant in the Swiss Guards in France. He had little interest in ever living in the castle and so sold it in 1683 to the Abbot of St. Gall for 25,000 Gulden. For over a century, the castle remained a possession of the Abbey and was occupied by a succession of overseers. The castle was often used as a summer palace for the Abbot. In 1786/87 a large residence was added on the eastern side of the castle. This building included a great hall and comfortable rooms for the Abbot. After the 1798 French invasion of Switzerland and the creation of the Helvetic Republic the Abbey's estates, including Hagenwil, were nationalized. With the collapse of the Republic and the 1803 Act of Mediation, the Canton of St. Gallen was created, incorporating many of the Abbey's former estates. Two years later, in 1805, the Grand Council of the Canton decided to sell off much of the former estates including Hagenwil. Benedikt Angehrn bought the castle and in 1830 added a restaurant in the courtyard. In 1937/38 the castle was repaired and restored with the help of the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Protection. In 1985 an archeological exploration of the castle was undertaken. The old kitchen was replaced with a new, three story building in 2003/4. The castle and restaurant are still owned by the Angehrn family.Hagenwil Castle website accessed 8 February 2017 Castle site Hagenwil Castle and the village church The castle complex is a rough square surrounded by an 18th century deep water filled moat. In the center of the complex is the 13th century main tower. The main tower is , with unfinished, round stone walls that are up to thick. The original high entrance was on the northern side of the east wall, but was filled in when the west and east ground level entrances were opened, probably in 1551. The ring wall was added in either the 13th or 14th centuries. Much of the southern wall and gate are from the original ring wall. During the 15th century a palas was built along the north wall, incorporating the old tower. The old north-west corner of the ring wall was demolished and a two story half-timbered residence was added. A gatehouse was first built near the south-east corner in 1485/86, though it was later replaced. The eastern buildings, the entrance hall and a chapel were added in 1786/87. The old gatehouse was replaced with another that has the date 1741 carved above the entrance. Today the castle is open for tours by appointment. In addition the restaurant is open most days and many of the rooms are available for meetings and events.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History A castle in Arbon is first mentioned in 720 in a history of St. Gall Abbey. It stood on or near the site of the Roman era Arbor Felix fortress from 250 AD. After the Romans retreated south of the Alps around 400, the old fortress was abandoned. Sometime later a Frankish castle was built in Arbon probably for the Frankish royal family. By around 700, Arbon and presumably the castle, were the property of the diocese of Constance and an ecclesiastic overseer or bailiff ruled over Arbon. The oldest part of the current castle is a 13th-century, originally free standing, residential tower. The tower may have been built on the foundation of an earlier building. The lower walls are up to thick. Inside the castle there are two Romanesque fireplaces. In 1515-20 the Bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg rebuilt the castle to its current appearance. The old tower was rebuilt into a U shape. The upper most story, the gables and the hip roof are also from this reconstruction. The outer wall of the castle moved to stand exactly over the north-west corner of the Roman era fortress.Gesellschaft f√ºr Schweizerische Kunstgeschichte GSK accessed 15 January 2013 In 1822 the Stoffel silk ribbon weaving company moved into the castle. They remained there until 1907. In 1911 the castle was bought by Adolph Saurer, the founder of Adolph Saurer AG. He built workshops around the castle building as he experimented with motors, trucks and machinery. In 1944 his son, Hippolyt Saurer sold the castle to the city for 150,000 Swiss francs.Historisches Museum - Welcome accessed 15 January 2013 The city renovated and expanded the castle and in 1967 opened the Historisches Museum Arbon (Arbon History Museum).

Copenhagen was of mixed Thoroughbred and Arabian parentage, with his dam being sired by The Derby winner John Bull and his sire Meteor finishing second in the Derby. Copenhagen was foaled in 1808 and was named in honour of the British victory at the Second Battle of Copenhagen. Copenhagen did race in England for a short period, winning two races and finishing at least third in nine races out of his 12 career starts. Copenhagen was sent to Spain with Sir Charles Vane in 1813 and was then sold to the Duke of Wellington. Becoming his favourite, Copenhagen was the Duke's mount in the Battle of Waterloo. The horse was retired to the Duke's estate Stratfield Saye House and lived there for the remainder of his life, dying on 12 February 1836 at the age of 28 years. His grave site is marked with a marble headstone that is situated under a Turkey Oak planted in 1843. Background Copenhagen was bred by General Grosvenor, who was a nephew of the Earl of Grosvenor. Copenhagen's sire, Meteor, was second in the 1786 Derby and won several stakes races before he was retired in 1791 to the Earl of Grosvenor's stud. Copenhagen was foaled when Meteor was 25 years old and the stallion died in 1811 when Copenhagen was three years old. Copenhagen's dam, Lady Catherine, was a daughter of the 1792 Epsom Derby winner John Bull and an unnamed mare sired by the Rutland Arabian out of \\"a hunting mare\\" that was either \\"three parts Thoroughbred\\" or had no Thoroughbred parentage at all. The Rutland Arabian was owned by the Duke of Rutland and had limited success in the stud. Lady Catherine (\\"Lady Katherine\\" in the Racing Calendar) raced under General (then Colonel) Grosvenor's name as a five-year-old in 1801 and her dam was identified as \\"Morning Star's dam.\\" Lady Catherine produced a half-sister to Copenhagen, Chantress by Popinjay, in 1810 and is noted in the stud-book to have been \\"sent to Ireland.\\" In honour of Copenhagen's notable military service, Lady Catherine is the only \\"half- bred\\" mare listed in the General Stud Book. The circumstances surrounding Copenhagen's birth differ based on source. General Grosvenor allegedly took Lady Catherine (in foal with Copenhagen) to Denmark to be his mount during the siege of Copenhagen, a campaign that culminated in the Second Battle of Copenhagen. Copenhagen was either foaled after the battle in Copenhagen and named in honour of the British victory or Lady Catherine was returned to England before his birth and Copenhagen was foaled at Eaton Hall in 1808. The General Stud Book entry for his dam does not support the notion that he was foaled outside of the United Kingdom. =Description= Copenhagen stood 15 hands high and had a muscular physique on a small compact frame. When Copenhagen was purchased for the Duke of Wellington as a five-year-old, he was described as \\"a dark chestnut with two white heels, [he was] a hollow-backed, powerful horse\\" but reportedly had \\"bad shoulders.\\" Copenhagen allegedly \\"never refused his corn\\" but had a unique habit of eating while lying down. Wellington said of Copenhagen, \\"There may have been many faster horses, no doubt many handsomer, but for bottom and endurance I never saw his fellow.\\"Arthur Griffiths, Wellington and his Comrades (1892), reprinted Kessinger Publishing, 31 August 2004, p.182. His \\"enduring qualities\\" were often attributed to his \\"Arabian blood.\\" Racing career Wellington on Copenhagen, painted by Thomas Lawrence. Copenhagen raced until he was a four- year-old in the name of General Grosvenor. Copenhagen did not race as a two- year-old and was retired from racing in May 1812. He was a moderately successful racehorse, winning two races during his short racing career, once against a relative of the Derby-winning mare Eleanor. =1811: three-year-old season= In his first start at the Craven Meeting in April, Copenhagen was third in a 100-guinea sweepstakes race, losing to the filly Sorcery and an unnamed filly by Dick Andrews. A few days later, Copenhagen won a 50-guinea match race against Mr. Fisher's colt \\"brother to Spaniard\\" and was beaten by the filly Tippitywichet in a match race. At the First Spring Meeting in Newmarket, Copenhagen paid 20 guineas forfeit to Lord Bentinck's colt Pheasant and a few days later was beaten by the Duke of Rutland's colt Momus in a 100-guinea match race. At Huntingdon on 6 August, Copenhagen won a sweepstakes race, beating a horse sired by Ambrosio and Cressida (the full-sister of the Derby winning mare Eleanor and the dam of Derby winner Priam) and the next day, Copenhagen was third in a Gold Cup race to the horse by Ambrosio and the colt Juvenal. At Northampton, Copenhagen was third in a 70-guinea County Purse race after finishing second in all of the heats. Copenhagen finished third in a sweepstakes race and was third in the Oatlands Stakes at the Tarporley-Hunt meeting on 7 November. =1812: four-year-old season= Copenhagen started three times in 1812. At Chester on 4 May, Copenhagen was third in a ¬£50 Maiden Plate run in three heats, finishing fifth in the first heat and second in the remaining heats. A few days later at the same meeting, Copenhagen finished third in a ¬£70 Cup race run over three heats, finishing fourth in the first heat and second in the remaining heats, and was fourth in a Handicap Sweepstakes in the final start of his career. Copenhagen was retired from racing at the end of the season. Military service James Ward. General Grosvenor sold Copenhagen to Sir Charles Vane (later the Marquess of Londonderry) in 1812. Copenhagen was sent to Lisbon in 1813 with a contingent of other horses due to Vane's service as an adjutant-general in the Peninsular War. When Sir Charles left Spain to \\"join the Allied armies in Germany,\\" Copenhagen was sold to Colonel Charles Wood (or alternatively Colonel Gordon, who died at Waterloo) for \\"200 or 250 guineas,\\" ¬£300 or ¬£400, depending on the source. The Colonel bought Copenhagen and another horse for the Duke of Wellington. Wellington rode Copenhagen in a number of battles. Before Waterloo he took him on his hazardous ride to Wavre to liaise with Marshal Bl√ºcher. Copenhagen was the Duke's mount during the Battle of Waterloo, carrying him for 17 hours continuously during the battle. Immediately after the battle, from which Wellington emerged uninjured, Wellington dismounted and patted Copenhagen on the flank, causing the horse to kick towards the Duke's head, which the Duke narrowly avoided. Copenhagen continued to be Wellington's primary horse during the occupation of France. Retirement and death The Duke continued to ride Copenhagen in parades and other ceremonial events after the battle. Hair from the horse was made into jewellery. The horse was retired to the Duke's Stratfield Saye House and lived as a pensioner there for the remainder of his long life. Copenhagen was said to, \\"like being noticed\\" and \\"kissed hands and ate his apples with all possible grace.\\" =Funeral and grave site= Copenhagen's headstone with faded epitaph beneath the Turkey Oak planted by Mrs. Apostles in 1843 as photographed in 2009. Copenhagen died on 12 February 1836 at Stratfield Saye at the age of 28 years, reportedly due to indulging in too many sugary \\"dainties\\" such as \\"sponge cakes, bath buns and chocolate creams,\\" but he most likely died due to his advanced age. He was buried \\"very early in the morning\\" the next day with full military honours in the Ice-House Paddock at the Duke's country residence, Stratfield Saye House. The Duke personally witnessed the horse's burial and reportedly \\"flew into a most violent passion\\" when he noticed that one of Copenhagen's hooves had been cut off as a souvenir. The Duke reportedly exhumed Copenhagen's body a few months after his death to retrieve the other hooves as keepsakes, but \\"his three remaining hoofs had rotted away.\\" The pilfered hoof was eventually recovered. According to one source, a farmer bought the hoof for a little over three shillings and returned the hoof directly to the Duke. In another account, a servant confessed to the Duke's son many years after the incident to taking the hoof, stating that at the time, \\"None of us imagined that the first Duke would trouble his head about the carcase of the horse.\\" The returned hoof was later made into an ink-stand by the second Duke. Copenhagen was buried without a headstone, and a few years after his death, the Duke was asked by the United Services Museum to disinter his body so that Copenhagen's skeleton could be publicly displayed alongside the skeleton of Napoleon's horse Marengo. The Duke refused and claimed that he did not \\"know for sure where Copenhagen was buried,\\" a false statement given that the Duke had witnessed Copenhagen's burial. The paddock where he was buried at one time had \\"a noble cluster of elms in the centre\\" and his grave was once surrounded by a small railing. The large Turkey Oak that presently shades Copenhagen's grave was planted by the elder Duke's housekeeper Mrs. Apostles seven years after the horse's death on 21 November 1843 in commemoration of her twentieth year of service to the Duke. After his father's death, his son personally created an epitaph for Copenhagen and placed a marble grave marker beside the tree that was planted over his burial site. A lead plaque with the inscription and \\"some coins of George IV, William IV and Queen Victoria\\" were buried at the grave site. The inscription, the bottom-half faded over time, reads: Wellington Statue designed by Matthew Cotes Wyatt and unveiled in 1846. The second Duke thought that the horse's face was a good likeness of Copenhagen.  Cultural references  Copenhagen's likeness in the equestrian statue of Wellington by John Steell in front of General Register House in Edinburgh, unveiled 18 June 1852 =Depictions in art= Copenhagen was depicted as \\"a bay, a grey and a chestnut\\" in various paintings during his lifetime and after his death. In one instance the choice of his coat colour was due to personal preference. Copenhagen was painted accurately as a chestnut by Edwin Landseer, but the original work was repainted with Copenhagen as a grey on the orders of Lady Charles Wellesley due to her \\"having a preference for the grey colour in horses.\\"  Wyatt statue  The Duke of Wellington and Copenhagen were the subject of a \\"colossal\\" bronze statue designed by Matthew Cotes Wyatt and his son James. Construction of the statue began in 1840, four years after Copenhagen's death, and lasted until 1843. The , and statue was unveiled on 28 September 1846 with much fanfare and was hoisted into a prominent position on top of the Triumphal Arch, then located a short distance from the Duke's London residence, Apsley House, on Hyde Park Corner. Copenhagen's belly had a girth of 22 feet and eight inches and the section was used to host a \\"celebratory dinner\\" for Wyatt before the work was completed, and a \\"rider on horseback could readily pass under Copenhagen's torso without danger of scraping his beaver hat.\\" The portrayal was generally ridiculed in the press and by the public with a French spectator to the unveiling reportedly saying, \\"We have been avenged!\\" A young soldier reportedly said Wyatt's statue was \\"warning ambitious young officers of the fate that awaits them if ever they are so unfortunate as to achieve greatness.\\" The statue was viewable from Apsley House and remained at the Hyde Park location for the remainder of the Duke's life. Wyatt reportedly had difficulty sculpting the figure of Copenhagen and did not want to base the statue on Copenhagen's actual form in his later years, which was short, \\"calf-kneed and cow-hocked [with] quarters that drooped in a most unattractive fashion.\\" As a substitute, he based the statue on the conformation and measurements of the Thoroughbred racehorse Recovery, which he obtained from The Pictorial Gallery of Racehorses. During construction, the Duke's son and the artist Edwin Landseer toured Wyatt's foundry and viewed the cast of the horse's head. The rendition of Copenhagen's face with prominent flared nostrils was likened to \\"something like a pig's snout\\" by the press, which the second Duke asserted was an accurate portrayal and \\"very like Copenhagen.\\" = Modern depictions = *Copenhagen is played by Daniel Rigby in BBC Radio 4's Warhorses of Letters, \\"the world's first epistolary equine love story\\", a comic exchange of letters between Copenhagen and Napoleon's horse Marengo (played by Stephen Fry). The comedy ran for three series. *Copenhagen also appears alongside the Duke of Wellington in Bernard Cornwell's novel Sharpe's Waterloo; in the historical note to his later novel Sharpe's Prey, depicting the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807, Cornwell mentions Copenhagen's birth and commemorative naming. *Copenhagen was mentioned in Georgette Heyer's Regency Romance novel, The Grand Sophy, when the heroine, Sophy, talked about her own horse, Salamanca.

It continues the story of Saxon warlord Uhtred of Bebbanburg who keeps fighting against a new Danish invasion of Wessex and Mercia. Plot summary It is 899 AD. Alfred the Great is dying. Rivals for his throne are poised to tear his kingdom apart. Uhtred, a Saxon who has been raised by a Danish warlord, wants more than anything else to go and reclaim his stolen Northumbrian inheritance. But he knows that if he deserts the king's cause, Alfred's dream - a single kingdom encompassing all English speakers - might vanish. Uhtred is attacked by bandits sent to assassinate him, but defeats them. Alfred then sends him to negotiate a treaty with the king of East Anglia. Uhtred is suspicious and takes precautions which save him from an ambush. He manages to face a much larger Danish force led by Sigurd, a powerful Danish jarl, at a narrow bridge over the River Use. Sigurd attacks across the bridge, which negates his numerical superiority. Uhtred's men inflict numerous casualties, before burning the bridge. Uhtred aborts his mission and goes home. He travels to Ceaster, where Haesten is besieged by a Mercian force. Uhtred leaves some of his men under the command of his loyal follower Finan. He has heard of a prophetess named Aelfadell and is curious. Uhtred unwarily drinks a drugged potion she gives him. He awakes tied up, with vague memories of the previous night. Then three monks debate killing him, but Uhtred frees himself and slaughters them instead. He realizes that Aelfadell is being paid by Sigurd to make prophesies in the Dane's favour. Uhtred then borrows a ship from his son-in-law Sigurd and, masquerading as a Frisian who is going home, sneaks in and burns Sigurd's ships, keeping one to sail to Lundene. Uhtred is summoned to Wintanceaster by a dying Alfred. Alfred gives Uhtred a rich estate in Mercia at Fagranforda, finally rewarding him for his many invaluable services, but presses Uhtred into swearing an oath of loyalty to his son and heir, Edward, before dying. Aethelflaed is kidnapped by Aethelwold, but Uhtred saves her. After Edward is crowned king, Uhtred expects an attack from the Danes, but Sigurd is sick, and his fellow jarl and friend, Cnut, is unwilling to invade without him; Cnut also has troublesome Scots to deal with. Uhtred has three women impersonate a trio of Christian angels to provide prophecies of their own to counter the words of Aelfadell. Danish raiders kidnap two of the \\"angels\\" and learn the truth. The Danes finally invade, three years after Alfred's death, from Ceaster. Uhtred retreats to a rotten fort at Cracgelad only to be surrounded by a Danish force led by Haesten. Haesten does not attack, instead retreating in the night because his force was meant only to distract the Mercian army from the true threat. Uhtred, now reinforced by warriors led by Steapa and Aethelflaed, pursues the larger Danish force to find out where the main invasion is taking place. Uhtred finds the main Danish army and makes a hit-and-run attack that stops the enemy. Uhtred begs King Edward to come and attack, but Edward instead commands Uhtred to bring his men to Lundene, where his army is gathering. Uhtred arrives at Lundene expecting to move quickly, but Edward has been convinced by his advisors to wait, in part to await Sigelf and his 700 East Anglians. Strangely, the Danes do not move either. Uhtred suspects it is because they have no single leader and are divided as to what to do. The Danes finally head for East Anglia to lure Edward into following. Their plan is to capture Lundene, once he is out of position. Sigelf is secretly in league with them. A hundred of Sigelf's men have been left behind at Lundene, supposedly because they have no horses, but in reality to seize and hold open a city gate. Sigelf and the rest of his warriors are to turn on Edward when the battle starts. Uhtred figures it out and attacks the turncoat Saxons at night, pretending to be Danish, killing Sigelf when he tries to stop the fighting with what he mistakenly believes are his Danish allies. Afterward, Uhtred convinces the turncoat East Anglians to fight for him. The real Danes attack, and a major battle between shield walls ensues. The Danes greatly outnumber and eventually surround Uhtred's force. Steapa arrives with reinforcements before Uhtred's men are overrun, and pushes the Danes back. There is no clear victor, but several of the invading leaders are dead and Sigurd is wounded. The Danes are forced to leave, as winter is coming and there is not enough food for their large army. Title of the novel The books gained its title because Alfred the Great dies, but also because King Eohric king of East Anglia, and Aethelwold pretender to the West Saxon throne die in the last battle. Critical reception A reviewer for National Public Radio said, \\"His characters are vividly drawn, betrayals lurk around every corner, the humor is as sharp as the swords, and the action is non-stop.\\" In the New York Times, a reviewer wrote that Cornwell \\"writes morally complicated and intricate stories, and he‚Äôs won a following not just among readers but also among fellow writers.\\" A reviewer for The Guardian wrote, \\"There are moments of terror, including one particularly striking episode when Uhtred goes to visit a witch and is drugged, bound and gagged while the naked, shrivelled crone cackles madness. Cornwell's plot is enlivened by passages of clear beauty as he describes the natural world in which such horrors take place\\".

Nepal Times. His book Human Rights, Democracy and Governance was published in early 2010 by Pearson, New Delhi. He is also known for his book To Be A Nepalese, published in 2012 by Martin Chautari, Kathmandu. The book was originally published as Nepaliya Hunalai (Nepali: \\"‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡§≤‡§æ‡§à \\") He is also co-editor of the volume Chapama Dalit (Nepali: ‡§õ‡§æ‡§™‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§¶‡§≤‡§ø‡§§) published by Ekta Books, Kathmandu (2001). Office of Public Affairs and Communication at Yale University gives the biography of Lal as follows: > Born in a small village in the southern plains of Nepal, CK Lal studied > civil engineering, public administration, law and urban planning in his own > country and in India. As a columnist, he has written for Nepali and South > Asian magazines and newspapers for over two decades, and is a widely > published commentator across media outlets in South Asia.

Lal has written weekly columns in The Nepali Times (where he wrote for \\"State Of The State\\", and later \\"Fourth Estate\\", beginning in 2000, the year of its inception, to 2010), as well as for his columns in daily newspapers Republica and Nagarik. He also wrote for Himal South Asian, a monthly magazine about the Southasian affairs. Lal is widely cited and discussed in the Nepali academia for his insight on the politics, history, geography and culture in both domestic as well as international affairs. He has been writing regularly since the 1990s and is considered one of the most prolific writers in Nepal.An audience speaks here in www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2006/04/07/Letters/11513  Themes and Style  Most of Lal's writings center upon the contemporary and historical political scenario of Nepal and South Asia. However, he brings insights from a range of disciplines crucial to explaining such issues. Reluctant to be tethered in any narrow set of themes, he has written on politics, diplomacy, economy, media, and gender relating to Nepali or Southasian societies. He usually provides historical frameworks to analyze the unfolding dynamics in a society and hints that politics is not merely straitjacketed dry affair but rather the amalgam of historical forces, including power relations, economic and cultural landscape of the society, ethnicity and races, languages, and hierarchy of wealth distribution. He is known for being critical of the traditional notion of Nepali identity that he argues prioritizes cultural uniformity, treatment of the marginalized section of Nepali like Madhesis and Janajatis as outsiders or lesser Nepalis, and economic hegemony of the small section that is mostly composed of Hill elites. One of the recurrent themes in his essays is that the notion of Nepali has to be more inclusive based on acceptance of differences in cultural ethos, social mores, languages and hosts of socio-cultural identities rather than assimilation and coercion. He believes that \\"plural politics seeks to address the quest of dignity in a country through the politics of diversity,\\" which includes but is not confined to \\"institutionalization of jus soli citizenship, proportionate inclusion, representation based on population, federal structure and autonomous units of local government.\\" Other frequent themes of his essays are how politics should be prioritized first to achieve economically thriving and equitable societies. He thinks that the big political picture should be contextualized and prioritized by politicians, media, and the intelligentsia. In his essay in Republica titled \\"National Insecurity States,\\" he explores diverse issues about Bengaluru, often called Bengalore. As a striking remark regarding the official name of the city, he writes: \\"The paradox is striking‚Äîmore modern the city, the more traditional sounding name it wants for itself.\\"  Notable Work  = 2000 = His first column in the Demo Issue (Issue #00, July 2000) of Nepali Times, a weekly newspaper in Nepal, in which he wrote for ten years, was titled \\"Elusive Peace.\\" In it, he writes: \\"Keeping the peace is expensive business. In a country where half the people live below the official poverty line, Rs. 6 billion will be used this fiscal year to police the population.\\" The article argues critical remarks on then most pressing issue of containing Maoists' mayhem that the onus of keeping peace is upon then Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. At that time, Maoists were already waging an insurgency and growing as a political force. = 2001 = In Nepali Times essay titled Letter from Lille, he narrates his visit to France about his conception of common ways to address the suffering and grievances through discourses and \\"ideas that transcend time and space.\\" Regarding religions and social harmony, he mentions: \\"The need to reform religions is no less pressing. After all, religion is politics with cold deities or dead prophets as leaders. It might be desirable to simply abolish religion, but that, too, is unlikely to happen anytime soon. So the only option for us is to have platform for inter-faith dialogues, and inter-religious parliaments where criticism is not considered heresy.\\" = 2010 = In an essay titled \\"Wall of words\\" published in Himal Southasian's December 2010 issue, he broaches pertinent issues on the freedom of speech in India, taking into account the prominent controversy that flared up when Arundhati Roy, an activist from India, decided to speak up her conscience. He writes: > There is little to complain about in the observation that Roy made. With the > people wanting azaadi, and living in an almost permanent state of siege by > the Indian security forces, Kashmir has indeed never been an integral part > of India. This statement is applicable to some states of the Northeast too, > where Indian has connotations different from what the word is taken to > signify elsewhere. Had the government gone for Arundhati Roy‚Äôs head for > telling the truth, its actions would only have added further lustre to her > celebrity status. What the Indian establishment has done instead is to let > loose upon her the hounds of the media and the foxes of the chattering > classes.  Reflections in Rep√∫blica  He also wrote bi-weekly essays in Republica titled \\"Reflection.\\" The themes were literary as much as political loosely structured in the style of memoir and story about his personal experiences.  To Be A Nepalese (2011)  The book is a meditation on the identity, complexity, and context of being a Nepali and exploration of its vulnerabilities. The book was originally written in Nepali as Nepaliya Hunalai (Nepali: ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡§≤‡§æ‡§à) originally conceived as a working paper for Martin Chautari, Kathmandu, Nepal. The English version is an abridged version of the Nepali version, which was conceived first. The book was given a good reception in Nepali intelligentsia as a timely reflection on burning issues of citizenship, federalization, ethnicity, and other political notions as the book reflects on the issues and problems of Nepali identity in the present and the way forward in the future. The Nepali version of the book contained commentaries by 20 leading thinkers and politicians of Nepal.  Fourth Estate  Lal wrote bi-weekly column Fourth Estate in Nepali Times starting January 2010 until October 2010. The column's themes related to journalism, media coverage of events, international trends in reporting and analysis, advertising aspect of media, relation of the Fourth Estate with the state and the public, and so forth.  Criticism of PEON  He is known for being critical to what he dubs Permanent Establishment of Nepal (PEON), which, he opines, is a group usually consisting of a historically advantaged castes that resists any change to its hold of political, economic, and cultural power in Nepali society. He is vocal about inclusiveness of various groups and sections of Nepalis, clustered by geographic, social, cultural, and economic fault- lines, in the political process through diversity in state apparatuses. After the promulgation of Constitution of Nepal, 2072 that helped rise UML Chairman Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli to the position of the prime minister, he has repeatedly voiced concerns in his writings and interviews about Oli's wrong intentions regarding the rights of marginalized community. He criticized national media based in Kathmandu for failing to properly note the violence by the state police that resulted in the death of protesters and bystanders, especially in the Terai region.  Advocacy Against Constitution of Nepal (2072)  Lal has publicly advocated against several key features of the Constitution of Nepal (2072). In an aftermath of promulgation of the constitution, he has given interviews and speeches and written extensively against some provisions that he believes to be discriminatory. Arguing that citizenship cannot be conflated with nationality, he commented that the \\"fast- tracked\\" constitution ensured a new forum for the hold of traditional hill elite through the \\"bloodline, masculinity and patriotism.\\" He believes that the four key discriminatory provisions of the Constitution are: 1. citizenship provisions, especially targeting the Madhesis, 2. the implicit mention of Hinduism as the religion of the state, even though officially Nepal is designated secular, 3. demarcation of federal states, with the dominant ruling elite retaining its former power, and 4. the dissolution of equitable and positive discrimination provisions of the Interim Constitution of Nepal meant to redress wrongs of the historic injustice against many groups. As the controversy divided the whole country on fundamental issues of citizenship and federalism, he showed qualms over the formation of Eminent Persons Group (EPG) to look into the aspects of Nepal-India relationship for the prime minister Oli's visit to India, who he said, are \\"notable worthies\\" of the regime. He wrote in Catch News, an India-based publication: \\"For any sensible Prime Minister of Nepal, resolving the conflict over the contested constitution of the country would have been the topmost priority.\\"  References  * Dixit, Kanak Mani, \\"Dekheko Muluk\\", 2010, Jagadamba Publications * C.

It belongs to the section Bunya (the only living species of which is Araucaria bidwillii from Australia) of the genus Araucaria. A. mirabilis are known from large amounts of very well preserved silicified wood and cones from the Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest, including tree trunks that reached in height in life. The site was buried by a volcanic eruption during the Middle Jurassic, approximately 160 million years ago. Discovery Fossils of Araucaria mirabilis are found in great abundance in the Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest of Patagonia, Argentina. They were the dominant species of a forest buried by a volcanic eruption about 160 million years ago. The petrified forests of A. mirabilis were first discovered in 1919 by the German- Argentinean botanist Anselmo Windhausen. Noting that petrified cones were being kept as souvenirs by local farmers in the area, he explored the region and discovered the site of the petrified forests in 1923. He sent the specimens he collected to the German botanist Walther Gothan in Berlin in 1924. Gothan named them Araucaria windhauseni in honor of Windhausen in 1925. However, the Italian-Argentinean botanist Carlo Luigi Spegazzini had also acquired specimens from the petrified forest from various sources. He tentatively identified the specimens as Araucarites mirabilis in 1924. An American paleontological expedition led by Elmer S. Riggs (1923-1924) of the Field Museum of Natural History also discovered the petrified forests. The numerous specimens Riggs collected (who identified them as Araucaria) were later described by the American paleontologist and paleobotanist George Reber Wieland as Proaraucaria elongata (1929), Proaraucaria mirabilis (1935), and Proaraucaria patagonica (1935). Wieland and Gothan interpreted the absence of separate petrified seeds as evidence that the cones did not shed their scales at the final growth year. This was originally stated by Wieland as a justification for its classification under a new genus Proaraucaria. An emended description was published by the Scottish paleobotanist Mary Gordon Calder in 1953. Calder questioned the conclusions of Wieland and Gothan. She also discarded the earlier classification of Spegazzini of Araucarites. The latter is a form genus, usually used for incomplete plant fossil specimens that resemble Araucaria but lack enough preserved details for more accurate classifications. Citing striking similarities with the extant Araucaria bidwillii, Calder reclassified the specimens as Araucaria mirabilis. Taxonomy and nomenclature Araucaria mirabilis belongs to section Bunya of the genus Araucaria. It is classified under the family Araucariaceae of the order Pinales. Its closest living relative is the Australian bunya-bunya (Araucaria bidwillii). The genus name Araucaria is derived from the Spanish exonym Araucanos (\\"from Arauco\\"), referring to the Mapuche people of Chile and Argentina. The specific name mirabilis is from Latin for \\"wondrous\\" or \\"amazing\\". Description A large number of petrified tree trunks of A. mirabilis are found still standing in the Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest. Preserved in volcanic ash, some of the specimens measure in diameter and were at least in height when alive. The trees were preserved just as the cones had finished maturing. Petrified Araucaria mirabilis cones The cones are spherical, ovoid to ellipsoidal in shape, with a wide axis. They average in length. The largest specimens are nearly in diameter. The center of the cones consist of a parenchymatous pith surrounded by fused vascular bundles (two for each bract-scale complex, with each vascular bundle containing resin canals). The bracts have thick and wide woody wings tapering towards the base. They are around long and wide, including the wings. They are overlain by fertile scales containing one seed each, embedded on the upper surface. They are arranged helically. The \\"ligules\\" (the free tip of the fertile scale characteristic of Araucaria) are wide, high, and long. The mature seeds of A. mirabilis are about long and wide. The seed integument has three layers of tissues - the sarcotesta, the thickened sclerotesta, and endotesta. It is fused to the nucellus (central portion of the ovule) only at the base. The sclerotesta (the \\"shell\\") also exhibits a zigzag pattern of sclereids. The fossilized seeds are exquisitely preserved, showing both mature and immature stages. They often contain well-developed dicotyledonous embryos, indicating that they were capable of lying dormant. The size of the cones did not indicate maturity as small cones around in diameter can be found with fully formed embryos. Most of the cones have been preserved before their seeds could be dispersed. Some cones, however, do not contain embryos and the naked axes of cones have also been recovered (described by Wieland as a separate species - Proaraucaria patagonica). It is believed that A. mirabilis shed only its seeds but not the scales at maturity. Nevertheless, no separate petrified seeds or bracts have been recovered. Small woody corm-like structures have also been found. Initially identified as \\"seedlings\\", are now known to be lignotubers. Paleobiology and paleoecology A. mirabilis exhibits two characteristics shared only by A. bidwillii among extant Araucaria species. First is the separate origins of the vascular bundles of the bract and fertile scales; second is the highly vascularized \\"ligule\\". They also both have dicotyledonous embryos. On this basis, A. mirabilis is classified as belonging to the section Bunya. However, the seeds of A. bidwillii are much larger, long and wide, than the seeds of A. mirabilis. A. bidwillii also exhibits cryptocotylar hypogeal germination (the cotyledons are non-photosynthetic and remain in the shell on germination), while there is evidence that indicates that A. mirabilis and other extinct members of the section Bunya exhibited epigeal germination (the cotyledons are photosynthetic and expand above-ground). In addition, no reliably identifiable fossils of members of the section Bunya have been recovered from Australia, the native range of A. bidwillii. The only existing species of Araucaria in South America today are Araucaria angustifolia and Araucaria araucana. Both belong to the section Araucaria of the genus. Setoguchi et al. (1998) have recommended that the extinct members of the section Bunya (which includes Araucaria sphaerocarpa of the United Kingdom) be treated as a separate group. A. mirabilis is found in association with other conifers, including Pararaucaria patagonica (not to be confused with the synonym Proaraucaria patagonica of A. mirabilis), and Araucarites sanctaecrucis. P. patagonica is also known from cones. It has no living descendants and its closest living relatives appear to be members of the modern family Cupressaceae (cypresses). A. sanctaecrucis fossils consist of foliage and branches. The fossils of the putative bracket fungus Phellinites digiustoi are also found in the Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest. The latter was initially believed to be the oldest known mushroom-forming fungus (Agaricomycetes). Later examinations now make it likely that P. digiustoi was, in fact, part of the periderm of the fossilized bark of A. mirabilis. It is believed that the long necks of sauropod dinosaurs may have evolved specifically for browsing the foliage of the typically very tall A. mirabilis and other Araucaria trees. The energy-rich Araucaria leaves required long digestion times and were low in protein. This and the global distribution of vast forests of Araucaria makes it likely that they were the primary food sources for adult sauropods during the Jurassic. Juveniles, however, which lacked the bulk of the adults and required larger amounts of proteins for growth, probably subsisted on other plants. A. mirabilis fossils have been found with damage resulting from beetle larvae. These beetles are believed to be the ancestors of the most ancient lineage of bark beetles in the weevil family (Curculionidae) - the members of the tribe Tomicini, which are still serious pests of conifers today. They were probably host-specific to members of the genus Araucaria since the Mesozoic. Modern A. bidwillii are also hosts to primitive weevils from the family Megalopodidae and leaf beetles from the family Nemonychidae. Distribution and geologic time range Araucaria forests were distributed globally and formed a major part of the woody flora of the Mesozoic era. The Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest is part of the La Matilde Formation, dated to the Bathonian to Oxfordian ages (164.7 to 155.7 million years ago) of the Middle to Upper Jurassic. The area was once part of the subtropical and temperate regions of the southern supercontinent Gondwana in the Mesozoic era, a more or less continuous landmass consisting of what is now modern South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, Australia, New Zealand, and New Guinea.

She studied under Gabriel Faur√© at the Paris Conservatoire, and in the 1950s, after a long absence from performing while she raised a family of five children, she recorded a series of discs of Faur√©'s music that have been reissued on compact disc to considerable acclaim.88 notes pour piano solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Neva Ed., 2015, p.52. Life and career She was born as Germaine Suzanna Jeanne Thyssens in Maastricht in the Netherlands, the eldest of the three children of a Dutch father, born Joannes Jacobus Thijssen but known as Jean-Jacques Thyssens, and his wife Jeanne Caroline Schmidt, who was from Alsace.Germaine Thyssens genealogyMorrison, Bryce. Notes to Testament CD, Faur√© Piano Music, OCLC 50920398 Jean-Jacques, who was director of Peugeot in Belgium, died in July 1907, when his eldest child was not quite five years old. Encouraged by her mother, she began to study the piano when she was about five years old, and later also studied the harpsichord. At the age of eight she made her concert debut playing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A, winning high praise from the critics.Harari, p. 14 She studied at the Royal Academy of Li√®ge, and in 1914, at the age of 13, entered the Conservatoire de Paris, which was then headed by Gabriel Faur√©.Plaistow, Stephen. \\"Faur√© Nocturnes\\", \\"Building a Library\\", CD Review, BBC Radio 3, 12 November 2011 She studied in the class of Isidor Philipp and later of Marguerite Long. To support herself while a student, she gave piano lessons and played incidental music in cinemas. In 1920 she was awarded the first prize at the Conservatoire in piano and in musical history.Harari, p. 15 In December 1924 Thyssens married Paul Valentin, and hyphenated his name with hers. By now she had begun to establish herself as a piano soloist, appearing with leading chamber musicians and with the Concerts Colonne, but she gave up her musical career completely to raise her family of five children. After 25 years away from professional music, Thyssens-Valentin resumed her career in 1951, with a performance of the Mozart concerto in which she had made her debut as an eight-year-old. The conductor for her return concert was Albert Wolff, through whom she was introduced to the director of the Salzburg Festival, where she made her first appearance the following year.Harari, p. 16 Between 1956 and 1959, she recorded a series of discs for the French recording company Ducretet-Thomson. They were not widely available outside France, and as the company failed to keep pace with the introduction of stereophonic recording its catalogue went out of print during the 1960s.Oliver, Michael \\"Faur√© ‚Äì 13 Barcarolles\\", Gramophone, August 2002, p. 67 In 1956, Thyssens-Valentin became the first pianist to play all Faur√©'s piano works at a series of concerts. She gave a second complete cycle the following year. Between 1958 and 1966 she also taught. In the 1960s she took part in the first performance of a complete cycle of Faur√©'s chamber music in company with, among others, Paul Tortelier.Harari, p. 17 She continued to promote the works of Faur√© in later years. After she had played all 13 of his nocturnes at the Salle Gaveau in 1974, Faur√©'s daughter-in-law greeted her with the words, \\"Oh! Madame, quel effort!\\"Nichols, Roger. \\"Germaine Thyssens- Valentin\\", Gramophone, Awards Issue, 2002, p. 117 Thyssens-Valentin retired in 1983; her last concert, in November of that year comprised music by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Faur√© and Debussy. She died in Paris in 1987, aged 85. Reputation Though Thyssens-Valentin was little known outside France during her lifetime, the reissue on compact discs of her Ducretet-Thomson recordings, particularly those of Faur√©'s music, brought her to a wider international audience. In Gramophone magazine, the critic Michael Oliver wrote that although never having previously heard of her, The critic Bryce Morrison, a specialist in piano music, wrote of her playing of Faur√© as \\"distinctive, fluid, understated and of a rare tonal and poetic delicacy and finesse ‚Ä¶ No other pianist, in my experience, has shown a comparable inwardness or capacity to penetrate to the very quick or essence of one of music's most misunderstood geniuses.\\"Morrison, Bryce. \\"Germaine Thyssens-Valentin plays Faur√©\\", Gramophone Awards Issue 2002, p. 39 Her Gramophone Award winning recording of Faur√©'s Nocturnes is especially admired: in November 2011, in a comparative review for BBC Radio 3 of all recordings of the Nocturnes, Stephen Plaistow judged Thyssens-Valentin's recording to be the finest.

They appeared in the 1930s and were most commonly used in the 1950s and 1960s, but were replaced by telescopic shock absorbers in the 1970s. One of the earliest patents for a hydraulic lever arm shock absorber was awarded in 1925 to Georges de Ram, who was already an established maker of friction disk shock absorbers. Hydraulic shock absorbers, invented by Ralph Peo in 1930, appeared as a development to replace the previous friction disks. These had, at best, provided a constant damping force, no matter what the size or speed of the suspension movement. With a viscous device using hydraulic oil, the resistance force increased with speed, so providing better damping for larger suspension bumps.  Rotary vane  The first hydraulic shock absorbers were of the rotary vane pattern. These consisted of a cylindrical oil-filled body, bolted to the chassis. A lever arm was attached to the axle and inside the cylinder, this rotated a spindle carrying a vane or paddle. This vane had only a small hole in it, through which the hydraulic oil could pass. Resistance to flow through the hole provided the damping effect. These were first developed by Maurice Houdaille around 1906, but remained largely ignored in favour of the simpler friction devices for some years. This type was most common pre-war, although Ferrari continued to use the Houdaille vane-type for Formula One racing cars into the late 1950s.  Lever type  A post-war development was the lever shock absorber.A better name might have been the 'piston' type, as both types described here use similar levers. This had a large cast body containing a cylinder and pistons attached to a similar spindle and lever arm. Some used a pair of pistons for bump and rebound, others used a single double- acting piston. Some, such as the VW Beetle until 1949‚Äì1951, had only single- acting shock absorbers, with no rebound damping. Flow of hydraulic oil around the piston took place through valves mounted in the body. Separate valves were provided for each direction, giving the useful feature of a different resistance to bump and rebound. These valves were sometimes easily adjustable from outside the damper body.  Integral wishbones  Front suspension, with a lever arm shock absorber forming an upper wishbone Many cars of this period began to use independent front suspension, often a double wishbone. The upper wishbone could conveniently also be used as the lever of the shock absorber, reducing the mass and bulk of the suspension, and also avoiding at least one ball joint. The spindle of the shock absorber now became the upper suspension pivot, usually double-ended. One of the last mass-production sports cars to still use lever arm shock absorbers was the MG B. This had a lever arm shock absorber as the upper wishbone. A popular handling upgrade in later years was to fit telescopic shock absorbers instead. The lever arm wishbone was still retained, but now as a simple wishbone with no damping.  Obsolescence  During the 1960s, the lever arm was replaced by the telescopic shock absorber. This was encouraged by better roads and motorways, increasing average speeds and driver expectations of handling. The telescopic shock absorber dissipated heat more effectively, owing to its larger working volume of fluid and also the better ratio of surface area to fluid volume. About the only area where lever arm shock absorbers still are actively used is tank suspensions, where their compact size and unique geometry allow them to be easily integrated with the suspension's torsion bars, and the massive tank chassis acting as a one huge heatsink alleviates the heat dissipation problems. Some designs of this type of shock absorber lend themselves well to their modification as an active suspension actuators, and at least one modern main battle tank (Russian T-14 Armata) is said to have this type of suspension.

In November 2011, it was awarded a contract to run Hinchingbrooke Hospital, as a National Health Service hospital operated by a private company, the first NHS hospital to be so contracted. It began the contract in February 2012.http://news.sky.com/story/899461/firm-to-manage-nhs- hospital Circle Health withdrew from the hospital after only 3 years of the 10-year contract, shortly after being severely criticized by the regulator CQC over standards of care and hygiene. The Care Quality Commission report indicated that \\"Medical services were inadequate because we found poor emotional and physical care which was not safe or caring. This was not reported by leaders of the service to the trust management therefore we judged the leadership to be inadequate.\\" It was the worst rating for 'caring' that the CQC had ever given. The period in which Circle was operating the hospital was described as \\"a disaster\\" by the GMB union. The then chairman of the British Medical Association remarked that \\"What has happened in Hinchingbrooke shows that the responsibility of running a critical public service can never be handed over, and so the insistence on private providers as a potential solution to problems facing Hinchingbrooke was always misguided.\\" Circle's independent hospitals, Circle Reading and Circle Bath, also provide NHS care under the NHS Choose and Book scheme. In December 2019 the company acquired BMI Healthcare, the biggest private hospital provider in the UK. The combined group will have annual revenues of almost ¬£1 billion and a national network of hospitals. History Circle was founded in 2004. It said that it wanted to be a model \\"a little bit like John Lewis\\" or a law firm, and referred to itself as a \\"partnership\\". The flattened organisational structure is said to allow quality and efficiency to remain high, through the creation of \\"clinical units\\". In January 2010, Gordon Brown, as Prime Minister, said: \\"Circle's provision of healthcare from the private sector is crucial to a 21st century health service.\\" The company's plans were ambitious, involving opening 30 private hospitals and encompassing the possibility of running 30 NHS trusts in time. In October 2009 it was shortlisted to become the first franchisee of an NHS trust. It raised ¬£200m from investors and had an initial public offering on AIM, with the shares peaking at ¬£2. In 2015, Circle entered a ¬£50m deal with Tech Mahindra to improve IT infrastructure and applications. In October 2015, Circle entered an agreement with Advanced Oncotherapy to open a proton beam therapy cancer centre on Harley Street. In April 2017 work began on a third private hospital, in Birmingham. As Circle Integrated Care, it has had a prime provider contract to manage musculoskeletal services in Bedfordshire since 2014 and a ¬£74m deal to oversee musculoskeletal services in Greenwich began in April 2017. The company announced in December 2012 that Ali Parsa had stepped down as Chief Executive. Steve Melton assumed the position of Chief Executive until November 2016. Paolo Pieri, a former Finance Director of lastminute.com, is now chief executive. In November 2016, Circle announced that it is it to develop hospitals in China in conjunction with Chinese investors. In April 2019, it opened a ¬£23m hospital in Shanghai. The hospital provides access to multi-disciplinary teams including specialists outside of China. In November 2019 the Financial Times reported that it is to acquire BMI Healthcare, the biggest private hospital provider in the UK. Corporate Structure = Private ownership = In 2017, the company was taken private by Toscafund Asset Management and its affiliate Penta Capital. Previously, the company had been listed on the Alternative Investment Market. Its initial public offering in June 2011 which raised ¬£45 million, valued the company at ¬£95.4 million. In June 2012 it raised ¬£47.5 million through a placing of shares with institutional investors. In December 2013, the company secured ¬£25 million of new funding and overhauled its corporate structure to grant its employees and NHS staff working at its sites direct access to its publicly traded shares. During its time on AIM, as Circle Holdings plc, investors included Odey Asset Management, Lansdowne Partners, Balderton Capital, BlackRock, Invesco Perpetual, BlueCrest Capital Management and Toscafund Asset Management. In March 2017 Toscafund proposed to buy all the company shares, valuing the company at ¬£74 million. Circle reported that \\"the underlying performance of the group improved considerably during 2018\\", making an EBITDAR profit of ¬£12.3m, up from ¬£6.7m the year before, although the company had an overall loss of ¬£11m as a result of \\"exceptional costs ... relating to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill\\". = Employee ownership = Initially, the company operated an equity incentive program under which doctors were offered equity in the company in return for a share of the consultants‚Äô private work, which was said to be \\"pivotal in raising capital from third party debt and equity investors\\". Circle employees were offered shares in the company for free, providing they met performance criteria. Consultant and staff ownership reduced to 25% after paying off ¬£257 million in borrowings in 2013, and those shares were bought in 2017 by Toscafund and Penta Capital. In 2014, Circle won \\"Employee-Owned Business of the Year\\" at the Employee Ownership Association Philip Baxendale awards, while a report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Employee Ownership referenced \\"impressive\\" productivity statistics from Circle but noted that \\"the argument that these successes derive not from the ownership model, but from an engaged workforce\\". Speaking at Hinchingbrooke hospital, Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office Minister, described the Circle model as \\"a third option which goes beyond the monopoly of state provision or the private sector\\". The British Medical Journal's description of Circle as \\"a John Lewis-style social enterprise co-owned by its employees\\" was challenged by Prof Martin McKee: \\"Staff shares amount to only 49% of the total number of shares, and the staff‚Äôs decision making powers are far less than even this suggests\\". However, the Nuffield Trust found ‚Äúthe company‚Äôs participative management style ‚Äì based on devolving power and responsibility to the frontline ‚Äì [to be] important in terms of motivating staff‚Äù, while the King‚Äôs Fund found that Circle was ‚Äúdeveloping the leadership skills and technical expertise for staff to test and implement service change‚Äù. Centres =Circle Bath= A private hospital that opened in 2010 at Peasedown St John, near Bath. Circle Bath has a rating of Good from the Care Quality Commission. It was described by The Observer as ‚ÄòOne of the finest hospitals in Britain‚Äô. In 2017, it won a Wylde IA Happiest Workplace in the South West competition. =Circle Reading= A private hospital that opened in August 2012 at Kennet Island, Reading. Circle Reading has a rating of Good from the Care Quality Commission. = Circle Birmingham = Circle is building a private hospital on the site of the former BBC Pebble Mill studios. At a reported cost of ¬£50m, it is expected to create 250 jobs. It will have expandable number of operating theatres, initially three, and a 120-bed rehabilitation facility. =Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre= This was opened as the largest Independent Sector Treatment Centre in Britain, as part of a programme of reforms to the NHS which aimed at introducing choice by increasing the diversification of providers. It was operated by Circle between 2008 and 2019. In 2010 the centre was visited by Andrew Lansley, who said: \\"The fundamental thing is, is it providing a good care to patients on the basis of NHS principles? Yes it is.\\" It reportedly made a profit of ¬£4 million in the six-month period to 30 June 2013, up from ¬£2.5 million for the same period the previous year. In 2013, when Circle‚Äôs five-year contract expired, commissioners decided to reconfigure services in the area. Circle had run outpatient dermatology services for the Nottingham area since 2008, with a mix of staff seconded from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and those directly employed. Circle's contract was renewed but the dermatology services were redesigned by Rushcliffe Clinical Commissioning Group, on behalf of all the Nottinghamshire commissioners, \\"based on its own specification\\". In December 2014 it was announced that six of the eight consultants had left rather than transfer to Circle, while recruitment and retention was a problem for NHS hospitals across the East Midlands. David Eady, President of the British Association of Dermatologists, described dermatology nationally as \\"a specialty in crisis\\" and that \\"no single region in Britain has enough consultants\\" to meet Royal College of Physicians recommendations, which meant Circle replaced them initially with locum doctors, for whom Circle had to pay nearly ¬£300,000 per year per consultant. The transfer of services from the NHS to Circle was described as an ‚Äúunmitigated disaster‚Äù in an independent report commissioned by the CCG and undertaken by Dr Chris Clough of Kings College Hospital London. The British Association of Dermatologists stated that it was \\"very concerned by the decline of services in Nottingham from a centre of excellence to somewhere now unable to offer expert dermatology, dermatological care for patients... and now its failure to deliver teaching to trainees and medical students\\". In 2018, local commissioners extended Circle's contract after a legal challenge. The following year the centre, which has 700 staff and treats around 250,000 patients annually, was taken over by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. Circle had a rating of Good from the Care Quality Commission, and Outstanding for surgery. =Circle Clinic Stratford= This clinic attached to a GP practice in Stratford-upon-Avon was run by Circle Clinics Limited but in June 2014 it was announced that SWFT Clinical Services, a subsidiary of South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust, was to take it over as Circle had stopped providing services at the clinic in April to focus on inpatient services. =Hinchingbrooke Hospital= In November 2011, Circle won a 10-year contract to run the struggling NHS Hinchingbrooke Hospital. The hospital‚Äôs buildings and staff remained part of the NHS, but Circle took over all day-to-day management responsibilities. Dr Stephen Dunn, director of policy and strategy at NHS Midlands and East, described it as \\"a good solution, focused on local needs. Without this deal, services might have been cut, the hospital might have had to close, or an ¬£80m subsidy might have needed to support the existing management.\\" In a 2012 national survey of NHS patients, Hinchingbrooke Hospital came first for patient satisfaction. The Prime Minister‚Äôs former special advisor on health commented in the Daily Telegraph that these results, along with improved care and reduced waiting times, had shown \\"the right kind of reform can turn around shoddy government monopolies and transform them into huge success stories\\". However, during 2012 losses doubled, and Circle obtained a ¬£4 million advance on fees to ease cash flow problems at the hospital. For the Conservative Party this was seen as a test case for private sector contracting. Following the early successes at Hinchingbrooke, where it appeared the hospital had attracted some orthopaedic surgery from Addenbrookes Hospital Circle stated that they would like to bid for more NHS contracts. In November 2012 a National Audit Office (NAO) report into the franchise was published. It found that while Circle had made early improvements in some clinical areas, the in-year deficit was already ¬£2.2 million higher than planned. Circle would have to generate unprecedented levels of savings to pay the deficit and most of the savings were expected in the later years of the ten-year franchise, so the value for money of the project could not easily be assessed for some time. The NAO found that while NHS East of England had assessed bidders‚Äô savings proposals, the relative risks had not been fully considered, which had the potential to encourage over-optimistic bids. Matters started to deteriorate further. In the 2013 NHS staff survey involving 28 key findings, Hinchingbrooke came out worse than the NHS average on two-thirds of the findings (19 of them), and was in the lowest 20% of trusts in almost half of the findings (13 of them). In February 2013 The Health Service Journal reported that senior health figures were questioning the viability of using the model more widely in hospitals. They cited austerity and the need to reduce activity in hospitals as key drivers. In December 2013 the company announced that it expected its Hinchingbrooke contract to finish at or near break-even by the end of its financial year. The Care Quality Commission had inspected the hospital and were satisfied. Waiting times in the A&E; department were reported to be among the best in England and Dr Foster revealed the hospital has a ‚Äústatistically significant low mortality rate‚Äù In April 2014 it was reported that the hospital was likely to record a deficit in the region of ¬£600,000 to ¬£700,000 for the year ending 31 March 2014 and in July 2014 Hinchingbrooke Hospital was referred to the Secretary of State for Health for failure to meet their statutory duty to break-even financially. The hospital made an offer in September 2014 to pay local GPs a ¬£50 'administrative fee' for surgery referrals in an email, signed by Hinchingbrooke chief executive Hisham Abdel-Rahman, which was rapidly withdrawn when the company was accused of bribery. A visit by inspectors from the Care Quality Commission in the same month highlighted severe issues with patient care: inspectors observed that \\"staff treat patients in an undignified and emotionally abusive manner\\" and they spoke to patients who had been \\"told to soil themselves\\". In November 2014 Jenny Raine the chief financial officer left. UNISON called for Circle to be 'sacked', claiming that papers tabled for the Board meeting in October - which did not include a financial report - showed the organisation faced (i) potential penalties of up to ¬£200,000 per month for failure to meet targets for patients waiting longer than four hours in the accident and emergency department (ii) potential penalties for failing to reach electronic discharge summary targets which already stood at ¬£138,000 and (iii) potential penalties of a further ¬£150,000 for failing to increase the number of patients discharged at weekends. The Union said staff turnover was more than 13 per cent. In January 2015 Circle announced that because Hinchingbrooke Hospital was \\"no longer [financially] viable under current terms\\" it wanted to withdraw from operating the hospital under the exit terms of the contract. Later the same day, the Care Quality Commission recommended the Trust be placed into special measures after it was rated \\"inadequate\\" on the questions of whether it was caring, safe and well led. They had concerns about the trust‚Äôs leadership because both the Circle management team and the trust board said that the other was responsible for holding the trust‚Äôs executive team to account. Circle's chief executive Steve Melton said before the report was published: ‚ÄúWe understand their report will be published soon, and fully expect it to be unbalanced and to disagree with many of its conclusions\\". The CQC later accepted that it had made 200 mistakes in its report. Awards In 2015, Circle became Private Hospital Group of the Year at the LaingBuisson Awards. In 2017, a Circle initiative won the HRH The Prince of Wales Integrated Approaches to Care Nursing Times Award, followed in 2018 when Circle won Best Healthcare Provider to the NHS at the Health Service Journal Partnership Awards.

Depending on the logic circuitry employed, this may result in a wired-OR or wired-AND logic function. Since there are O(n^2) potential bridging faults, they are normally restricted to signals that are physically adjacent in the design. Modeling bridge fault Bridging to VDD or Vss is equivalent to stuck at fault model. Traditionally bridged signals were modeled with logic AND or OR of signals. If one driver dominates the other driver in a bridging situation, the dominant driver forces the logic to the other one, in such case a dominant bridging fault is used. To better reflect the reality of CMOS VLSI devices, a dominant AND or dominant OR bridging fault model is used where dominant driver keeps its value, while the other signal value is the result of AND (or OR) of its own value with the dominant driver.

It is the second-oldest non-collegiate choir in Oxford, having been founded in 1921,Hibbert pp. 267, 301.Sadie p. 830 and according to The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians is one of the \\"institutions of lasting significance to Oxford's musical life that were established during this period\\". Currently the choir has around 150 singing members and usually performs three concerts annually in either the Sheldonian Theatre or Oxford Town Hall with the Orchestra of Stowe Opera. History 1950 choir rehearsal with George Thewlis conducting and Basil Thewlis at the piano Originally the choir was known as the Iffley Glee Club, and after renaming itself the Iffley Choral Society in 1923, it became Oxford Harmonic Society in 1924 after moving base to central Oxford.Hibbert pp. 301‚Äì302. In August 2014 the choir changed its name to Oxford Harmonic Choir. A notable element of Oxford Harmonic Choir's performing history has been participation in various music festivals held in Oxford. These included a performance of Haydn's Creation in 1932 as part of a three-day Haydn festival which was described in The New York Times as \\"by far the most genial as well as the most admirable commemoration Great Britain has had of one whose popularity in the eighteenth century rivalled that of Handel himself\\".Bonavia, The New York Times Other festivals involving performances by the choir included the 1948 Oxford Festival of British Music and the 1950 Oxford Festival of Johann Sebastian BachCaldwell, Hornby & Maw pp. 288‚Äì289, and the 1951 Oxford Festival of Arts linked to the Festival of Britain.Keesing's Record of World events Vol. VIII May 1951 p. 11441 May 6. Another long-established and oft-noted tradition of the choir is the programming of rarely performed works in addition to the standard choral repertoire.Handbook to the University of Oxford 1966 p. 324. Examples of this include: *Thomas Arne's oratorio Judith on 19 February 1950 ‚Äì quite possibly the last performance of this work in the UK and one of only a handful post 1800.Tasch p. 255. *Max Bruch's Das Feuerkreuz on 29 March 2003 ‚Äì one of several lesser-known choral works by Bruch performed by the choir in recent years. *Carl Loewe's Passion Oratorio on 31 March 2012 ‚Äì the UK premiere of this work originally composed in 1847. Since 1985, the choir has also taken part in a number of joint performances with the Bonn Philharmonic Choir in both Bonn and Oxford as part of activities celebrating the links between these twinned cities. One of the highlights of this partnership was a performance of Elgar's Dream of Gerontius in Bonn on 22 September 1991, also involving the Cologne Philharmonic. In addition to a highly enthusiastic response from the audience and reviewers from the Bonn press, the concert also gained considerable attention from The Elgar Society.Elgar Society Journal May 1992 and March 1995 p. 34. Notable conductors From 1923 to 1930 the choir's conductor was Reginald Jacques,Kennedy p.441.Holmes p.300. who subsequently went on to conduct The Bach Choir in London for many years. Other conductors of note included Sir John Dykes Bower (1931‚Äì33) Sydney Watson (1933‚Äì39), George Thewlis (1941‚Äì61), Sir David Lumsden (1961‚Äì63), Richard Silk (1963‚Äì71), Peter Ward Jones (1971‚Äì80), Philip Cave (1980‚Äì89) and Professor Brian Trowell (1989‚Äì90).Hyman pp. 21‚Äì24. Robert Secret has been the choir's conductor since 1990. Notable soloists and orchestras Over the years a significant number of well-known and well-loved professional soloists have taken part in the choir's concerts. The following are a selection: *Soprano ‚Äì Isobel Baillie, Susan Bullock, Lynne Dawson, Heather Harper, Margaret Ritchie, Dorothy Silk. *Contralto ‚Äì Muriel Brunskill, Jean Rigby, Monica Sinclair, Helen Watts. *Countertenor ‚Äì James Bowman, Paul Esswood. *Tenor ‚Äì John Mark Ainsley, John Elwes, Gerald English, Philip Langridge, Peter Pears, Steuart Wilson, Alexander Young. *Bass & Baritone ‚Äì John Carol Case, Thomas Hemsley, Roy Henderson, Henry Herford, Brian Kay, Dennis Noble, John Noble, Stephen Varcoe. Although concerts have usually involved local orchestras (sometimes amateur and sometimes professional), on occasion the choir has employed well-known household names. The most notable of these include the New Queen's Hall Orchestra under Sir Henry Wood in 1927, two concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1944 and 1949, and The King's Consort in 1989. In addition, the choir was also invited on several occasions to participate in performances promoted by Oxford Subscription Concerts (an organisation that put on numerous concerts in Oxford for several decades from 1920 onwards). These Subscription Concerts included the choir performing alongside the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir Hugh Allen in 1929 and the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent in 1935.Hyman pp. 39‚Äì46.

The oldest sources connects the palace to the Ercolani family and was initially built by Giacomo della Porta. The family of Luigi Gottifredi, a priest of the Society of Jesus, who settled there, made a radical renovation employing Camillo Arcucci, an architect of the Roman Baroque, in the years 1645 to 1650. In the early 19th century, the palace was the residence of the Ambassador of Austria and then the Infanta of Spain and Duchess of Lucca, Maria Luisa of Bourbon- Spain who died there in 1824. It was later acquired by Commander Grazioli, then Baron of Castelporziano and Duke of Santa Croce di Magliano, who in 1863 entrusted the restoration which ended in 1874. The facade of the building on Via del Plebiscito is decorated with pilasters with capitals. At the center of it opens the door flanked by two Doric columns of gray granite and topped by a balcony.

If the MHC class I levels are enough, killing of the cell doesn't proceed (left), but if they aren't, the killing signal proceeds and the cell is eliminated (right). Killer Activation Receptors (KARs) are receptors expressed on the plasmatic membrane of Natural Killer cells (NK cells). KARs work together with inhibitory receptors (abbreviated as KIRs in the text), which inactivate them in order to regulate the NK cells functions on hosted or transformed cells. These two kinds of specific receptors have some morphological features in common, such as being transmembrane proteins. The similarities are specially found in the extracellular domains and, the differences tend to be in the intracellular domains. KARs and KIRs can have tyrosine containing activatory or inhibitory motifs in the intracellular part of the receptor molecule (they are called ITAMs and ITIMs). At first, it was thought that there were only one KAR and one KIR (two-receptor model). In the last decade, many different KARs and KIRs, such as NKp46 or NKG2D, have been discovered (opposing-signals model). NKG2D is activated by the cell-surface ligands MICA and ULBP2. There is an unfortunate confusion about the KIR acronym. The KIR term has been started to be being used parallelly both for the Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and for the Killer Inhibitory Receptors. The Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors involve both activatory and inhibitory receptors. Killer-cell inhibitory receptors involve both immunoglobulin-like receptors and C-type lectin-like receptors.  Morphology  There are two different kinds of surface receptors which are responsible for triggering NK-mediated natural cytotoxicity: the NK KARs (meaning: Killer Activation Receptors) and the NK KIRs (meaning: Killer Inhibitory Receptors). Such receptors have a broad binding specificity and, therefore, are able to broadcast opposite signals. It is the balance between these competing signals that determines whether or not the cytotoxic activity of the NK cell should get started. As KARs and KIRs are receptors with antagonic effects on NK cells, they have some structural characteristics in common. Firstly, both of them are usually transmembrane proteins. Apart from that, the extracellular domains of these proteins tend to have similar molecular features and are responsible for ligand recognition. When the ligand binds to the KAR, ITAMs in cytoplasmic tail of the receptor are phosphorylated by the kinase PTK and the transduction signal takes place. The accessory signaling molecule CD3Œ∂ and the adaptor protein DAP10 or DAP12 have been simplified for a better comprehension. Therefore, the opposing functions these receptors have must be attributed to differences in their intracellular domains. KARs proteins possess positively charged transmembrane residues and short cytoplasmic tails that contain few intracellular signaling domains. In contrast, KIRs proteins usually have long cytoplasmic tails. As the chains which form KARs are not able to mediate any signal transduction in isolation, a common feature of such receptors is the presence of noncovalently linked subunits that contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic tails. ITAMs are composed of a conserved sequence of amino acids, including two Tyr-x-x-Leu/Ile elements (where x is any amino acid) separated by six to eight amino acid residues. When the binding of an activation ligand to an activation receptor complex occurs, the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs in the associated chain are phosphorylated by kinases, and a signal that promotes natural cytotoxicity is conveyed to the interior of the NK cell. Therefore, ITAMs are involved in the facilitation of signal transduction. These subunits are moreover composed of an accessory signaling molecule such as CD3Œ∂, the Œ≥c chain, or one of two adaptor proteins called DAP10 and DAP12. All of these molecules possess negatively charged transmembrane domains. A common feature of members of all KIR is the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic tails. ITIMs are composed of the sequence Ile/Val/Leu/Ser-x-Tyr-x- x-Leu/Val, where x denotes any amino acid. The latter are essential to the signaling functions of these molecules. When an inhibitory receptor is stimulated by the binding of MHC class I, kinases and phosphatases are recruited to the receptor complex. This is how ITIMs counteract the effect of kinases initiated by activating receptors and manage to inhibit the signal transduction within the NK cell.  Types  Following the criterion of the structure, KARs are found in three different groups. The first group of receptors where KARs are included is called Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors (NCR), and it only includes activation receptors. The two other classes are: Natural Killer Group 2 (NKG2), which includes activation and inhibition receptors (in this article, we will only describe NKG2 with an activator role), and some KIRs which, exceptionally, don‚Äôt have an inhibitor role. The three receptors which are included in the NCR class are NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30. The crystal structure of NKp46, which is representative for all three NCR, has been determined. It has two C2-set immunoglobulin domains, and it‚Äôs probable that the binding site for its ligand is near the interdomain hinge. Two NKG2-class receptors are NKG2D, considered the most important and the better studied NKG2 receptor, and CD94/NKG2C. NKG2D, which doesn‚Äôt bind to CD94, is a homodimeric lectin-like receptor. On the other hand, CD94/NKG2C consists in a complex formed by the CD94 protein, which is a C-type lectin molecule bonded to the NKG2C protein. This molecule can bind to five classes of NKG2 (A, B, C, E and H), but the union can trigger an activation or an inhibition response, depending on the NKG2 molecule (CD94/NKG2A, for example, is an inhibitor complex). It‚Äôs important to mention that most KIRs have an inhibitor function, which has been generalized in this article, but a few KIRs that have an activator role also exist. One of these activatory KIRs is KIR2DS1, which has an Ig-like structure, like KIRs in general. Finally, there is CD16, a low affinity Fc receptor (FcŒ≥RIII) which contains N-glycosylation sites; therefore, it is a glycoprotein. Killer Activation Receptors are associated with signaling intracellular chains. In fact, these intracellular domains determine the opposite functions of activation and inhibitory receptors. Activation receptors are associated with an accessory signaling molecule (for instance, CD3Œ∂) or with an adaptor protein, which can be either DAP10 or DAP12. All of these signaling molecules contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activated motifs (ITAMs), which are phosphorylated and consequently facilitate signal transduction. Each of these receptors has a specific ligand, although some receptors that belong to the same class, such as NCR, recognize similar molecules.  Physiology  As we mentioned previously, natural killer cells can discharge their function properly through two types of receptors: Killer Activation Receptor (KAR) and Killer Inhibition Receptors (KIRs). Both type of receptors act together to activate or not activate the Natural Killer cell following the opposing-signals model. KARs can detect a specific type of molecules: MICA and MICB. These molecules are in MHC class I of human cells and they are related to cellular stress: this is why MICA and MICB appear in infected or transformed cells but they aren't very common in healthy cells. KARs recognise MICA and MICB when they are in a huge proportion and get engaged. This engagement activates the natural killer cell to attack the transformed or infected cells. This action can be done in different ways. NK can kill directly the hosted cell, it can do it by segregating cytokines, IFN-Œ≤ and IFN-Œ±, or by doing both things. Furthermore, there are other less common ligands, like carbohydrate domains, which are recognised by a group of receptors: C-type lectins (so named because they have calcium-dependent carbohydrates recognition domains). In addition to lectins, there are other molecules implicated in the activation of NK. These additional proteins are: CD2 and CD16. The last one works in antibody-mediated recognition. Finally, there is a group of proteins which are related to the activation in an unknown way. These are NKp30, Nkp44 and Nkp46. To recapitulate, these ligands activate the NK, as we explained. However, before the activation, Killer Inhibition Receptors (KIRs) recognize certain molecules in the MHC class I of the hosted cell and get engaged with them. These molecules are typical of healthy cells but some of these molecules are repressed in infected or transformed cells. For this reason when the hosted cell is really infected the proportion of KARs engaged with ligands is bigger than the proportion of KIRs engaged with MHC I molecules. When this happens the NK is activated and the hosted cell is destroyed. On the other hand, if there are more KIRs engaged with MHC class I molecules than KARs engaged with ligands, the NK isn't activated and the suspicious hosted cell remains alive. To conclude, we should add that each KAR has its specific KIR and they always work together. For instance, the C-type lectins receptors are inhibited by some CD94/NKG2 complex.  KARs and KIRs: their role in cancer  One way by which NK cells are able to distinguish between normal and infected or transformed cells is by monitoring the amount of MHC class I molecules cells have on their surface provided both in an infected and in a tumor cell the expression of MHC class I decreases. What happens in malignant transformations, that is to say cancers, is that a Killer Activation Receptor (KAR), located on the surface of the NK cell, binds to certain molecules which only appear on cells that are undergoing stress situations. In humans, this KAR is called NKG2D and the molecules it recognizes MICA and MICB. This binding provides a signal which induces the NK cell to kill the target cell. Then, Killer Inhibitory Receptors (KIRs) examine the surface of the tumor cell in order to determine the levels of MHC class I molecules it has. If KIRs bind sufficiently to MHC class I molecules, the ‚Äúkilling signal‚Äù is overridden to prevent the killing of the cell. In contrast to this, if KIRs are not sufficiently engaged to MHC class I molecules, killing of the target cell proceeds.

The practice requires a high level of technical skill to present the photograph free from misleading information that may cause misinterpretation. The photographs are used in clinical documentation, research, publication in scientific journals and teaching. The profession =Employment= Medical photographers document patients at various stages of an illness, injuries and before and after surgical procedures. They record the work of healthcare professionals to assist in the planning of treatment and education of the public and other healthcare professionals. The nature of the work requires a respect for and sensitivity to people, an awareness of sterile procedures and an adherence to privacy legislation and policies. The BioCommunications Association, in a survey commissioned in 2008 of individuals working in medical photography, found that most medical photographers are employed by university affiliated hospitals and research centers. Ten percent were freelancers working in specialty clinics such as dermatology, ophthalmology and plastic surgery. A few of these provided services to the medical-legal profession. Medical photographers photograph patients in clinics, wards and in operating rooms. They may also be called to photograph an autopsy and gross specimens in the pathology department. Specialized photography techniques using photomacrography and ultra-violet and fluorescence photography may also be used. The role of the medical photographer has changed over the years from being exclusively medical to incorporating more general photography of a commercial or editorial nature to support public relations and education. Video production is playing an increased role; medical photographers are often responsible for video conferencing from operating rooms and are involved in tele-medicine. Departments employing medical photographers tend to number five people or less. Some medical photographers specialize in areas such as ophthalmology and dermatology. =Education and training= Most medical photographers have a degree in photography from a college or university and frequently have a degree in the sciences. They need to have a good understanding of photographic and optical principles, and also understand the technical requirements of a particular job in order select or modify equipment. Knowledge of digital imaging software is necessary to edit and output images while maintaining scale and color balance. An interest in science and medicine are important. A basic knowledge of anatomy and physiology coupled with a working knowledge of medical terminology is required in order to discuss the photographic needs with medical staff and other healthcare providers. Because they are working with patients, medical photographers must have the manners and sensitivity to make patients comfortable while being photographed. They must also be aware of the laws governing privacy and copyright.  History  The scientists were quick to realize the merits of photography because of its perceived ability to present an objective image of what was seen. This solved a problem of representation by artists who were asked to produce illustrations only from description or highly influenced by the interpretation of physicians and surgeons. The first application of photography in medicine appears in 1840 when Alfred Fran√ßois Donn√© of the Charit√© Hospital in Paris photographed sections of bones and teeth. He began making daguerreotypes through a microscope. Donn√© published engravings made from photographs by his student L√©on Foucault. Hugh Welch Diamond, a physician and founding member of the Royal Photographic Society, used photography as a tool in medicine, particularly in the field of mental illness. He was working in the women‚Äôs section of the Surrey County Asylum in Twickenham in 1852, where he attempted to create a catalog of visual signs of insanity by photographing the patients and organizing the photographs by symptom. Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne de Boulogne began photographing inmates in the Salp√™tri√®re mental hospital in Paris in 1856. He devised a method for activating individual muscles of the face through electronic stimulation. With the assistance of Adrien Tournachon, brother of Felix Nadar, he photographed facial expressions and at one point listed 53 emotions that could be identified based on the muscular action. His work was published in 1862 in M√©canisme de la physionomie humaine in what was the most remarkable of all photographically illustrated books in medical science prior to 1900. G.-B. Duchanne de Boulogne, Synoptic plate 4 from Le M√©canisme de la Physionomie Humaine. 1862, albumen print. In the upper row and the lower two rows, patients with different expressions on either side of their faces Dr. Jean- Martin Charcot, a student of Duchenne de Boulogne, believed like Diamond that photographs would play a significant role in the diagnosis and management of patients. A medical photography unit was established at Salp√™tri√®re hospital in Paris in 1878 by Charcot. He hired Albert Londe who worked at Salp√™tri√®re under Charcot's supervision. Londe was to not only make photographs but to create new apparatus to record signs and symptoms. Charcot began publishing Nouvelle iconographie de la Salp√™triere in 1888 that used photographs to show clinical presentations of cases at Salp√™tri√®re. Londe published a major reference on the practice of medical photography La Photographie m√©dicale. in 1893. Londe developed a systematic method for photographing patients in fixed views that took into account depth of field and distortion caused by lens design and lens to subject distance. There was growing interest in cultures and peoples in distant regions of the globe and photography was a way to place them under study especially when combined with influences from the study of phrenology and Darwin‚Äôs work on natural selection. In 1850, Joseph T. Zealy (1812‚Äì93) was commissioned by Louis Agassiz to make daguerreotypes of plantation workers of African origin in the southern United States of America. The pictures were intended as scientific documentation to support theories of ethnology. Carl Damman published a collection of photographs of different ethnic groups in Anthropologisch-ethnographisches Album in Photographien. and in the same year William Marshall published A phrenologist amongst the Todas, or the Study of a Primitive Tribe in South India. History, Character, Customs, Religion, Infanticide, Polyandry, Language. Thomas Huxley established a system of photographing the human body with fixed views which included a rod of known dimension to make measurements. Francis Galton believed it was possible to systematically organize traits of inheritable attributes, intellectual, moral and physical with respect to families, groups, classes and racial types. He believed that mental attributes could be measured by studying physical attributes. In an effort to identify and group characteristics, he made composites of up to two hundred photographs to create a universal physiognomy example of a group or type. Dr. Reed B. Bontecou, a physician and soldier from New York, took the camera to the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) and photographed wounded soldiers as well as documenting treatments, surgeries and working conditions of the physician. The albums of wounded American Civil War soldiers treated and photographed by Bontecou have appeared in numerous exhibitions, many of the images were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of the Photography and the American Civil War exhibition. The Burns Archive Press book Shooting Soldiers: Civil War Medical Photography By Reed B. Bonteco, contains a large selection of these photographs and a history of Bontecou. R. B. Bontecou. Written by Dr. Stanley B. Burns, Published by Burns Archive Press. This photograph depicts G. Porubsky, Co B. 46th NY volunteer displaying excision of the humerus. This photograph from Bontecou's teaching album shows the drawn-in suspected path of the bullet. Bontecou's operation of bone removal in the upper arm left the patient with a useless limb. Many were amputated in the antiseptic era of the 1880s. Attempts to publish medical photographs in anatomy text books was met with limited success in the early years of photography. The lack of textural and tonal variation made photographs difficult to interpret. This may have been due to the spectral sensitivity of early materials to blue, violet and ultra-violet light. This grouped the other tones together and rendered them as similar shades of black. Orthochromatic plates did not become commercially available until 1883 and even then the process allowed separation only of the blues, greens and yellows. In 1861, Nicolaus R√ºdinger published Atlas des peripherischen Nervensystems des menchlichen K√∂rpers, Cotta‚Äôschen, using photographs by Joseph Albert of frozen sections. The photographs had to be retouched to make the structures obvious. Sterophotography became of interest as a way to add a three-dimensional quality to show the spatial relationships of gross anatomy and clinical case studies. Between 1894-1900, Albert Neisser of Leipzig produced a stereo atlas of anatomy and pathology. David Waterston published a set of stereo cards in 1905 to be used in a stereo-viewer. The cards showed labelled dissections, descriptive labels and came packaged with the stereoscopic viewer. There were attempts to photograph inside the body as early as 1883. Emil Behnke used a carbon arc lamp, lenses and reflectors to photograph human vocal cords at exposures of ¬º second. Walter Woodbury had published a ‚Äúphotogastroscope‚Äù in 1890 that showed pictures of the interior of the stomach and in 1894, Max Nitze published photographs of the bladder using a cystoscope. By 1870, Maury and Duhring had established a journal based on using medical photography, The Photographic Review of Medicine and Surgery, published by Lippincott in Philadelphia, USA provided case studies and before and after photographs. Most major centres of medical education had adopted photography as a method of documentation and study by the 1900s. Many photographers were working in multi-faceted disciplines from radiology, pathology and ophthalmology. Medical photography became a special field of photography and in 1931 a group of photographers working in medicine came together at Yale University in the United States of America to form the Biological Photographic Association, which later became the BioCommunications Association Inc.http://www.bca.org The group published a journal; the Journal of Biological Photography which was later incorporated into the Journal of BioCommunication.http://www.jbiocommunication.org Other organizations formed in England, Scandinavia and Australia. Photography continues today to play a role in medicine through documentation, research and education.  Patient consent issues  With the ubiquitous use of mobile phones for medical photography, mobile phone use for medical photography has been a rising issue in Canada. From 2000, the federal and provincial governments of Canada passed legislation to regulate the use, collection and disclosure of medical photography by healthcare professionals. As a result, Canadian companies have developed to create specialized mobile apps, such as ShareSmart, and businesses have sought to provide solutions to comply with the new regulatory scheme.

Procopius of Caesarea (Vandalic War II.21.2 & II.28.47) calls them the Leuathae (), while Flavius Cresconius Corippus calls them Ilaguas and Laguantan.

In 1347 the Margrave of Mei√üen, Frederick the Serious, purchased the estate back from the Duke of Brunswick who by then were the joint landlords together with the Margraviate of Landsberg. During the Halberstadt Bishops' Feud, which was prosecuted by Bishop Albert II of Brunswick (1325-1358) against territorial lords within the Harz region, mainly against the counts of Regenstein, the castle was fought over. It was captured by the Count of Mansfeld in 1362. It is possible that the fieldwork about 100 metres east of the castle was established at that time as a counterwork (Gegenbefestigung). The second phase of construction recognisable in the wall materials and characterised by brickwork is assessed by the sources as dating to the 14th century. In 1366 Duke Magnus of Brunswick was the owner of the castle. He exercised from here his rights of patronage over Sittichenbach Abbey. In 1485 the castle once more belonged to the prince-elector, Ernest of Saxony. From him it went into the hands of the Count of Mansfeld. From at least 1486 the lords of Morungen were vassals at the castle. In 1547 on the death of George of Morungen the lordship fell as an expired fief to the Saxon district (Amt of Sangerhausen. At that time the castle was already falling into decay. The date when it was finally abandoned is unknown.

He is known from two sources, the Latin poem Iohannis by the 6th-century Christian Roman poet Corippus and a Neo-Punic inscription from Lepcis Magna.A. F. Elmayer, \\"The Libyan God Gurzil in a Neo-Punic Inscription from Tripolitania\\", Libyan Studies 13 (1982), pp. 49‚Äì50. Neo-Punic inscription naming Gurzil According to Corippus, the Laguatan of Tripolitania carried a representation of Gurzil in the form of a bull into battle against the Romans when they revolted along with the Austurii in AD 546. They regarded Gurzil as the offspring of Amun, presumably the Amun whose temple was at Siwa, and a cow. Corippus also mentions idols of wood and metal, presumably also images of Gurzil. After several battles the Laguatan and their allies were defeated. Ierna, the chief and high priest of the Laguatan, was killed while trying to rescue the image of Gurzil. The image was destroyed. The combination of royal and priestly functions in Ierna is not otherwise attested among ancient Berbers. The Neo-Punic inscription is partially damaged and resists interpretation. The last four letters of the first line spell the name of Gurzil, while the first four of the second line spell Satur. If the latter is the Roman god Saturn it suggests that he was equated with Gurzil per an interpretatio Romana. This would be the only known instance of such an interpretation among the Berbers. The inscription may be read \\"[so-and-so] endowed the expenses for Gurzil‚ÄìSaturn\\". The name of Gurzil may be detected elsewhere in the toponymy of Tripolitania. A temple among the ruins of Gerisa (Ghirza) in Libya may have been dedicated to Gurzil, and the name of the town itself may even be related to his name. According to the 9th- century Muslim writer al-Bakrƒ´, there was a placed called Gherza in Tripolitania with a hilltop sanctuary containing a stone idol that the Berber tribes from the surrounding region still worshipped. The relief carving of a horned god at Volubilis has been tentatively identified as Gurzil. This would be the only evidence of his worship outside of Tripolitania, but the identification is highly speculative.

He studied at the Susan Budiardjo fashion school, and then moved to Los Angeles to study at the Istituto Artistico Dell Abbigliamento Marangoni in Milan, Italy. After studying fashion in Italy, he returned to Indonesia to establish his own fashion house. In 1993 launched a collection called \\"Sebastian Gunawan\\". Throughout his career, Sebastian Gunawan has shown evening gowns encrusted with beads, crystals, sequins and semiprecious stones, which in turn gave birth to \\"bling-blingism\\" for the fashion world in Indonesia. He is now a member of the Indonesian Fashion Designers Association.  From Sketch to Style  Sebastian Gunawan is also famous for his sketches. It was this talent that made him think to become a fashion designer. He started when he was still in high school. At first he designed clothes just for fun, but then Sebastian attended a design course at Susan Budihardjo Institute of Design in Jakarta in 1985. He then deepened his expertise in fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, Los Angeles, USA where he graduated and obtained the Certificate of Fashion Design. His teenage fashion sketches received recognition in Milan in 1991 when he graduated in Fashion Illustration at the Istituto Artistico Dell'Abbigliamento Marangoni. During his Milan years he also collaborated with Egon Von Furstenberg. He held his first fashion show in 1995. A collection named \\"Potret Hidup\\" (\\"A Life Portrait\\") featured designs that later became his signature mark: dramatic evening and ball gowns. In 1997 he created Votum, his second line; a ready to wear collection marketed in department stores in Jakarta. The collection is feminine and still rich in details. In 2000 Sebastian Gunawan again expanded his product range with the introduction of \\"Sebastian's\\", also called \\"Red Label\\". This collection is a design of pr√™t-a-porter, only available to loyal customers at his boutique. In 2005 Sebastian Gunawan again developed his fashion business by designing a collection of children's clothes, called \\"Bubble Girls\\". In 2006 he launched \\"Sebastian Sposa\\" a medium-high fashion bridal collection.  Glitz & Glam  Sebastian Gunawan's designs have an international taste. They are distinctly western, with a strong European touch. His designs are enhanced with embroidery, Swarovski crystals, beads, semiprecious stones and sequins sewn by hand using the techniques of haute couture. Having previously designed the evening gowns, he entered the Muslim fashion by participating in the \\"Islamic Fashion Festival\\" in Kuala Lumpur in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In 2004 the Indonesian Textile Association asked Sebastian to represent Indonesia at the IAF (International Apparel Federation) in Barcelona, Spain. The theme chosen by the committee was \\"Global Travel Fashion\\" He designed a collection including sheer tops and trousers as well as long jacket with an attractive application pattern. The collection was called \\"I Miss Bali\\". With this collection he was awarded the IAF Young designer's award. In 2004 he showed his collection in three events at once, the \\"Kuala Lumpur Fashion Week\\", \\"Hong Kong Fashion Week Spring Summer\\" and \\"Southeast Asia International Fashion Show\\" in Naning, China. A year later, he presented his main line collection at the \\"Bangkok International Fashion Week Summer 2005\\". Sebastian owns boutiques in a few shopping malls in Indonesia.

Laws had previously been in hardcore bands centred around CBGBs, and Furlow met Harding while helping a friend record a demo at Calliope Studios. The two rappers began writing rhymes and marking records with Post-It notes, which Harding would sample and compile into backing tracks for the pair. Harding helped the group develop its sound and introduced the duo to Jon Baker of Gee Street Records, which officially signed the act in 1992. After two years on a demo deal, New Kingdom released its debut album, Heavy Load, in 1993. Allmusic's Bret Love wrote of the album, \\"Heavy Load shows an awful lot of promise, but all too often New Kingdom fails to deliver.\\" New Kingdom released its second album, Paradise Don't Come Cheap, in 1996. Allmusic writer Ned Raggett, who gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and selected the album as the site's Album Pick, wrote, \\"[The album] arguably beats out the fine debut Heavy Load‚Äîthere's something even more belligerent, raunchy, and fiery about Furlow and Laws this time out.\\" However, The San Diego Union-Tribune writer Jeff Niesel wrote, \\"[It's] a clunky affair.\\" The group was more successful in Baker‚Äôs native UK than their own United States, where they were met with miscategorisation and industry indifference. The band were a significant influence on the emerging UK trip-hop scene - Tricky spent time in the studio with the group, learning their methods, while Morcheeba attended New Kingdom‚Äôs concerts and later collaborated with Furlow on record and in live performances. After releasing two albums, the band split up, feeling they had accomplished everything they'd set out to do.  Musical style  New Kingdom was praised for its unique sound and performance style. New Kingdom's musical style combines elements of hard rock, psychedelic music, funk, and blues. The group's live performances featured a disc jockey and live instrumentation by a guitarist, a drummer, and a percussionist, as well as a masked dancer. For the Paradise Don't Come Cheap tour, both Furlow and John Medeski played guitars for the band. The lyrical content of Nosaj and Sebastian is often abstract and ranges from autobiographical subjects to science-fiction fantasies. References made by the band range from Bruce Lee and Super Fly to the folklore of Paul Bunyan. Nosaj and Sebastian's rhymes are often unintelligible. Sebastian was previously a member of some local hardcore punk bands, and Nosaj was primarily influenced by Curtis Mayfield. The San Diego Union-Tribune writer Jeff Niesel described New Kingdom's music as a cross between Wu-Tang Clan and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, while Allmusic's Bret Love compared the group to Beastie Boys and Onyx. The New York Times writer Jon Pareles compared New Kingdom to rap-rock fusions by artists such as Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, Anthrax, Cypress Hill, and Wu-Tang Clan. In his review of Paradise Don't Come Cheap, Allmusic writer Ned Raggett wrote, \\"[The group's sound compares with] a Goodie Mob/Bubba Sparxxx collaboration produced by the RZA‚Äîor, say, Eminem's \\"Square Dance\\" completely gone to hell‚Äîwell before its time\\" and concluded that the only easy comparison between New Kingdom and another musical act is Wu-Tang Clan.

She is sometimes called a \\"national treasure\\" due to her passion for and promotion of traditional Indonesian batik techniques. Her work has achieved worldwide recognition, with fellow Indonesian designers such as Edward Hutabarat (himself credited with the batik revival) and Ghea Panggabean describing her as the real authority and leader of the mid-2000s movement to update and modernise batik. Despite this, Obin describes herself as simply a tukang kain, or vendor of cloth, stating that the genuine artists and designers are the craftsmen who make the textiles retailed through Bin House, her business.  Personal life and education  Born in Indonesia in 1955, Josephine Werratie Komara went to school in Hong Kong until she finished elementary school and then returned home, aged 14. Until his death in 2013, Obin was married to an archaeologist and anthropologist named Roni Siswandi; they have one son, Erlangga (called 'Erlang'). She is a self-taught textile designer who has never formally studied the subject, but taught herself through collecting, handling and examining fabrics, and seeing them made.  Business history  Obin started out in the 1970s, whilst Indonesia was a developing country, as a vendor of furnishing fabrics, selling raw silks for lampshades and upholstery. In the early 1980s she began to sell ikat-woven textiles, including shirts, using her research and knowledge of traditional fabrics to promote local cloth industries. In 1985, while going over the antique batiks and textiles she had collected since the age of 17, Obin was inspired to explore the crafting techniques that had gone into them, and developed her own hand-weaving and printing methods to enable her to create her own original fabrics. She also questioned why, despite her love for traditional textiles and cloths, there were no new patterns and designs. Through combining brand new motifs with traditional weaving techniques and methods using softer threads to create fabrics that could be batiked, Obin created completely unique yet totally Indonesian fabrics that did not rely on imported cotton and chiffons. In 1986, Obin opened her first Bin House showroom in Menteng, an upper class area of Jakarta. In 1989 she opened her first boutique in Japan. By 2001, in addition to several Japanese outlets, there were Bin House galleries in Bali and Singapore along with the Menteng establishment. There is also a retail outlet in the Netherlands. By 2012, Obin employed over 1,000 artisan workers to completely hand-create her fabrics, many of whom had passed their skills down through the generations. In addition to Japan, Singapore and Bali, Obin textiles are bought by traders and resold in Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and the United States, where her work is more desirable than equivalent pieces from Vietnam or Thailand. Due to their handcrafted nature, no two Obin pieces are identical. Flight attendant uniforms for Garuda Indonesia designed in 2010 In 2010 Obin helped design uniforms made from traditional cloth for staff and cabin crew at Garuda, the national airline of Indonesia. Although the kebaya-style blouse and skirt uniforms feature a traditional yet updated parang gondosuli batik design incorporating jasmine and garuda wings, these are printed rather than authentic wax-resist batik in order to ensure uniformity. By 2012, Obin's batiks were compared to designer handbags, with her shawls being worn by fashionable women to cocktail parties. Previously, batik had been considered a dark, heavy and old-fashioned fabric that was only worn by politicians and their wives to formal functions, but due to the work of Obin and Edward Hutabarat, it had become a desirable and fashionable fabric.  Textile heritage  Preserving the traditional skills and techniques of Indonesian textile production is extremely important to Obin, who describes the textiles produced under her name as \\"works of life\\", rather than works of art. In some cases, exceptionally elaborate batiks can take up to a year and a half to complete, which means that the end product is expensive, but it is more important to Obin that her workers receive appropriate payment and appreciation of their skills. Obin prefers to avoid cutting into her textiles, making them into sarongs and shawls so that their patterns are kept intact. Sometimes she asks buyers not to cut the fabrics, but instead to appreciate their craftsmanship, artistry and heritage techniques. She has said \\"Batik is our heritage and we must preserve it.\\" In October 2009, UNESCO recognised batik as an important part of Indonesia's heritage, naming it part of the world's \\"intangible cultural heritage\\". This designation was controversial with some Malaysians taking offence and claiming that batik was as much part of their heritage as Indonesia's, although Indonesian designers such as Hutabarat, Obin and Sanchia Hamidjaja were cited as major players in the batik revival of a few years earlier, which combined contemporary updates with heritage technique.  Museums  Obin's textiles are held by the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia, and institutions in Amsterdam and Japan. In 2010, the Korea Foundation hosted Wearable Art: Indonesian Batik Cloth, an exhibition of Bin House textiles, which was the first time that Korea had held such an exhibition. = Museum Kain = In a BBC interview in 2012, Obin stated her intention of opening a textile museum in Bali in 2013. Museum Kain (literally, \\"cloth museum\\") formally opened on 20 November 2013 in the Beachwalk shopping mall in Kuta. At the opening ceremony, Obin paid tribute to her late husband, whose idea the museum had been, and to her son, Erlang, who, after his father's death, took control to ensure that the plan went ahead. The museum, which is the first of its kind on the island, is also the first museum in Indonesia to use the latest digital technology such as touchscreens as a way of presenting an authentic collection.

The aircraft is made from wood and aluminium and covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The fuselage is made from square aluminum tubing that is TIG welded and weighs when completed. Its span wing is of a straight planform. The landing gear is conventional, with suspended main wheels and a steerable tailwheel. The cockpit is of an open design, with a small windshield. Controls are conventional three-axis, with ailerons, rudder and elevator. Since the death of the designer plans have been intermittently available and were last provided by Classic Aero Enterprises. Aircraft Spruce and Specialty continue to provide raw materials kits. The aircraft has an acceptable power range of . The use of the Rotax 277, or the similar weight and power Hirth F-33, allows the aircraft to fit into the US ultralight category if weight is carefully controlled during construction. However the H-3 is underpowered with this engine and most have been equipped with heavier engines of higher output, such as the Rotax 447 or the Rotax 503.

It is based on an old French fairy tale by Charles Perrault called Peau d'√¢ne (English translation: Donkeyskin). It was nominated for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature. The book contains numerous adult themes including incest, rape, and miscarriage. It features McKinley's typical protagonist, the resourceful heroine overcoming psychological trauma, and her favored motif of the animal helper. Plot summary The book centers on Lissla Lissar, the daughter of the most splendid looking people in all of the seven kingdoms. Despite her parents' fame for their looks, she was mostly ignored during her childhood as people predominantly focused on her parents, who in turn only focused on each other. When her mother falls ill and starts to lose her beauty, an artist is hired to paint a portrait of her as she was before her illness. He works nonstop for a fortnight until the painting is completed and shown to the queen. After viewing the painting the queen makes the king swear that he will only remarry if he can find a bride more beautiful than she, thinking that any other woman would pale in comparison, and dies shortly after he makes this promise. Lissar comes to her father's attention during the funeral, as he notices her strong resemblance to her mother. His behavior towards her is mistakenly seen as loving by the general public, who otherwise continues to ignore her. During this time she is also presented with a puppy named Ash from Ossin, a prince from a neighboring kingdom. After the funeral Lissar devotes her time to learning herbalism and raising Ash. She also purposely avoids her father, whose actions make her increasingly more uncomfortable. When she is seventeen a ball is held to celebrate and to find her a suitable husband, as she is now of marriageable age. During the party, however, her father monopolizes her attention and on the following morning, announces that he intends to marry her, much to her horror. She is equally horrified to learn that the present nobility believe this to be her fault, that she purposely did this for her own benefit. Lissar makes an unsuccessful attempt to hide away in her chambers, but on the third night her father breaks in through a forgotten door, violently raping his daughter, impregnating her in the process, and almost killing Ash. The following morning Lissar awakes with amnesia and flees to the mountains, where she finds a cabin. They stay for an entire winter, during which time Lissar miscarries and briefly regains traumatic memories of her rape, nearly dying. She is saved by a moon goddess who heals her wounds, grants her a white deerskin dress, and alters both Lissar and Ash so that they are unrecognizable; Lissar's hair changes from black to white, and Ash grows a coat similar to that of a borzoi. As another gift the goddess gives Lissar time to heal and to forget what happened to her, allowing her to once again forget her past. Lissar soon finds that she wants to be among people again and under the name Deerskin, travels to a small kingdom, unaware that this is the home of Prince Ossin. She is hired by Ossin to raise a litter of puppies whose mother has died. While she cares for the puppies she grows close to Ossin. Upon many calling her by the name \\"Lady\\" or \\"Moonwoman\\", Ossin tells her that the name comes from a legend of a beautiful princess who was raped and then abandoned the earth for the moon when her father dismissed her concerns. While telling her of the tale Ossin also shows Lissar a room filled with portraits of princes and princesses sent out to various kingdoms as a way of advertising their marriageability. She recognizes Ash, and then herself, but willfully keeps herself from remembering her full memories. It is only when Ossin proposes to her at a ball that Lissar is forced to confront her memories, at which point she flees back to the cabin with Ash and the puppies. After spending the winter recovering, Lissar returns to Ossin's city due to a compulsion and discovers that a wedding is due to take place that very day. She's horrified to learn that her father is going to marry Ossin's younger sister and confronts her father, revealing her true identity as his daughter and punishing him for his crimes using the goddess's powers. While she still has mental trauma stemming from the past, Lissar is now able to accept Ossin's love and to give their relationship a chance.  Reception  In an article for Tor.com, Jo Walton noted that \\"it‚Äôs a dark and disturbing fairytale retelling about rape and recovery, and I wouldn‚Äôt change a word of it. It‚Äôs not an easy book.

The only book he published before his untimely death in 1989 was The Independent Cook. It was re-issued in 2001 and chosen as 38th in the 50 best cookbooks of all time as selected by The Observer Food Monthly team (Jay Rayner, Bill Buford, Rachel Cooke and Allan Jenkins) in 2010 In August 1999, The Independent celebrated Round's work by publishing many admiring comments from the world of cooking. Amongst these were Raymond Blanc: \\"he was an extremely serious food writer. He was not only interested in restaurants, but also supermarkets, the food chain, all food issues. He was very interested in bringing the consumer to be far more critical and demanding. He criticised in a very honest way, but was never blunt. He had such a passion for food that he could easily deconstruct the food itself. Few critics can do that.\\" Clarissa Dickson Wright: \\"He was the bearer of the food torch which passed from Elizabeth David to Jane Grigson to him. Usually there's one person who's head and shoulders above his contemporaries, and he was that one. And I'm not saying that just because he's dead. No one matched his eclecticism and wit, his wicked humour. I still use his book Independent Cook and I will not lend it to anyone - I'm paranoid someone will nick it\\"; Marco Pierre White: \\"He was a rare man - he hasn't been replaced. His knowledge was first rate and he was a great all-rounder. He was very unusual in that he would be writing an article, for example about endive, and he'd ring me up and say \\"tell me three or four things that you'd do with endive\\" -a perfect example of his professionalism and humility. He was a critic and food journalist with a tremendous amount of integrity\\". The Guild of Food Writers Awards (established in 1996) continues to present in his memory the Jeremy Round Award for Best First Book in recognition of outstanding achievements in food writing and broadcasting. Before his meteoric rise as a cookery writer, Round also wrote poetry. He was a member of the group of writers meeting at The Old Fire Station in Oxford in the mid-1980s. Alan Davidson remembered \\"his wit, often self-deprecatory. And what I chose to represent him, with his warm approval, in an anthology of writing about food was a poem [\\"Utopia\\"] he wrote on realising, from something Paul Levy had written, that he had hitherto been part of the vulgar herd who did not know that tea is seldom drunk with food in China. The poet Martyn Crucefix celebrates Round as friend, poet and cook in 'In Memory of Jeremy Round' from the collection Beneath Tremendous Rain (Enitharmon Press, 1990). Jeremy Round was an old boy of Palmer's College in Thurrock, Essex, England.

It was published from 1905 until 1960 when it was absorbed by the rival paper The Cleveland Press. History The Cleveland News traces its antecedents to 1868, when The Cleveland Leader titled its late edition the Evening News. When a rival newspaper, the Cleveland Herald, ended publication in 1885, the Leader acquired rights to the name and retitled its evening edition the News & Herald. Cited in In 1905, investment banker and commodities broker Charles Augustus Otis, Jr. -- who the previous year had purchased the Cleveland World -- bought both the News & Herald and the Evening Plain Dealer, and merged the trio into the single afternoon daily paper, the World-News, which debuted June 12, 1905. It became the Cleveland News on September 13, 1905. Daniel R. Hanna Sr., who had bought the morning newspaper the Cleveland Leader in 1910, bought the Cleveland News from Otis two years later, and consolidated operations in the new Leader Building at East 6th Street and Superior Avenue. The Plain Dealer in turn bought the Cleveland Leader from Hanna in 1917, and the Sunday Leader became the Sunday News-Leader and later the Sunday News. Hanna remained involved, and in an effort to compete with the more successful Cleveland Press after World War I, he hired Arthur B. \\"Mickey\\" McBride as circulation manager for the Sunday and daily Cleveland News, which in 1926 moved to a new publishing plant at East 18th Street and Superior Avenue. After barely surviving the beginnings of the Great Depression, the News in 1932 was transferred by Hanna's heirs to the newly formed Forest City Publishing Company, which had also taken control of The Plain Dealer. Forest City ceased publishing the Sunday News on January 3, 1933, while continuing to publish the daily, staunchly Republican Cleveland News. Forest City announced the sale of the News to the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, owner of the Cleveland Press, on January 23, 1960. As Sterling E. Graham, president of Forest City, characterized his paper, \\"Ever since its beginning 55 years ago, the News' fate was to be a third newspaper.\\" Its net circulation at the time was 134,550, compared with the Press' 314,000.

Early life  Mukunda Das came from a modest background. His grandfather was a boatman and his father was a grocer. He was born as Yajneshwar De to Gurudayal De and Shyamasundari Devi on 22 February 1878, in the village of Banari, in the Bikrampur pargana of Dhaka District (currently part of Munshiganj District, Bangladesh). When he was seven, the family migrated to Barisal where they settled permanently. His father set up a grocery store in the Alekanda region of Barisal town. Being Vaishnavas, his father used to sing devotional songs while running the store. The Deputy Magistrate of Barisal, pleased with his melodious voice offered him the job of an orderly in the Barisal court. Yajneshwar's father took up the job and he began to run the store. Yajneshwar too was gifted with a melodious voice. He, from his very childhood, began to compose and sing songs on his own. He attended the Barisal Zilla School, but he did not like studies and was irregular at school. He spent most of his time in fishing, capturing bird's nests and playing with neighbourhood boys. In 1893, he was admitted to the Brojomohun School. He attended the Brojomohun School for six years, but dropped out after the eighth standard. Ashwini Kumar Dutta, upset at the failure of a pupil of his own institution, decided to speak to Yajneshwar himself. Datta had heard his melodious before and had realized the potential and talent in him. His called Yajneshwar to his house and initiated him into the patriotic movement.  Career  In 1897, after dropping out from school, Yajneshwar joined the group of Bireshwar Dutta, the kirtan singer of Barisal at that time. After the death of Bireshwar Dutta, he formed a kirtan group of his own. In 1900, he took initiation in Vaishavism from a monk Rasananda Thakur, sometimes also known as Haribolananda. His guru gave him the name Mukunda Das. In 1905, Ashwini Kumar Dutta gave an inspiring speech at the Barisal Town Hall, against the proposed Partition of Bengal. Stressing on the need to spread the message far and wide, he wished that message from the leaders could be carried to the villages through dramas and plays. Mukunda Das was deeply moved by Ashwini Kumar Dutta's speech. He resolved to fulfil the wish of the great patriot. Within three months he composed his masterpiece 'Matripuja'. The primary theme of his drama was patriotism and freedom movement. The goal of the freedom movement was to free Bharat Mata from the yoke of British imperialism. The children of Bharat Mata would lay down their lives to attain freedom. He raised a Swadeshi theatre group to stage plays across the villages of Bengal. In 1906, Mukunda Das staged his plays at different places of Barisal and then travelled to Noakhali and Tripura and returned to Barisal before the monsoons. In June 1906, he staged his drama at the Swadeshi Utsav in Barisal, where his play was highly praised by the national leadership. In October, he travelled with his group to Madaripur in Faridpur district, and from there to many places finally returning to Barisal in April 1907. On 16 April, he staged the play in the palace of the Rai Bahadur. After a run of two years, 'Matripuja' was successful in arousing the patriotic feelings of the masses of Bengal. The play was further popularized by the press. Bande Mataram, Yugantar, Sandhya, Nabashakti, Prabasi and Modern Review, each of them played a part in popularizing the drama. The government of newly formed Eastern Bengal and Assam clamped down, citing incitement to violence. In 1908, he staged the drama in few places in Khulna district, then in truncated Bengal, but he was stopped by the police when he tried to stage the play in Bagerhat. In October 1908, the drama stepped in to the fourth season. In 1908, he was arrested and imprisoned for three years on charges of sedition. In 1921, Mohandas Gandhi gave the call of Non-Cooperation Movement. Mukunda Das joined the movement with his proven repertoire of drama. Around 1923 the movement was called off and Mukunda Das settled with his group in Kolkata. 'Matripuja' was banned by the government at that time. He began to compose social plays in order to avoid being banned. In 1932, the government banned all his plays.  Later life  After the ban, he was restricted to singing only. He along with his group performed only musical shows. His health deteriorated. On 17 May 1934, he returned late from a performance and died in his sleep.  Works  Mukunda Das composed five dramas - Palliseva, Brahmacharini, Samaj o Path.  See also  * Ashwini Kumar Dutta  References   Further reading  * Chanda, Pulak (2011).

Justifying this manipulation of the image, Gursky said \\"Paradoxically, this view of the Rhine cannot be obtained in situ, a fictitious construction was required to provide an accurate image of a modern river.\\" Gursky produced a very large chromogenic colour print of the photograph, mounted it onto acrylic glass, and then placed it in a frame.

They are one of the most influential bands of the heavy metal scene in South America, in the 1980s, alongside bands such as Cross (Uruguay), Acido (Uruguay), Herm√©tica (Argentina) Massacre (Chile), and Sepultura (Brasil). The band also recorded in English and later settled in Canada.  History  = Beginnings in Uruguay = The band was formed in 1985 by original members Gustavo Rea (bass), Gustavo \\"Tycho\\" Artigas (guitar), Clement \\"Bhilo\\" Lopez (guitar), Jorge Villar (drums) and Charly D. Lopez (vocals). The five musicians started playing in Montevideo, as well as the surrounding areas, gradually amassing a following that expressed a keen interest in the band's new musical output. In 1986, Alvacast recorded their first demo, \\"Campos de sangre\\", containing the song \\"Campos De Sangre (\\"Fields of Blood\\"), and performed at the Montevideo Rock Festival with bands from Argentina, Brasil and Chile. The following year the band signed to the Orfeo record label and recorded their first album, Al Borde del Abismo, onto the vinyl medium, subsequently performing the full- length recording before a sold-out Odeon Theatre in Montevideo. Alvacast then traveled throughout Uruguay in support of their debut album and consequently secured a prominent position in the country's rock music scene of the time. Later in 1987, Alvacast featured in the Argentinian show, \\"Rock de Primera\\" (including Charly Garc√≠a, RIFF, La Torre and others on the bill), held in Buenos Aires, and then played at the Rock Theatre in November with Kamikaze (Argentina). During 1988, the band consolidated its lineup, with Clement \\"Bhilo\\" Lopez leaving the group in 1988 and Leonardo Lamela (guitar) joining it. It was also at this time that music industry press from around the world displayed an interest in the band itself, as well as its music, with European magazines running articles on the band's activities. Alvacast toured heavily in 1988, performing at Montevideo Rock II and playing smaller club shows in Buenos Aires throughout the year. Support for the live shows came from Dr. Jekyll, Retrosatan, and Herm√©tica, among others. In December 1988, Alvacast traveled to Chile to perform two shows in the capital, Santiago de Chile: one was at the Estadio Manuel Plaza, where audiences were disappointed by the show's technical aspects; and a second, more spectacular show was held at the Chile Stadium before more than 4,000 people, leading to high levels of subsequent press coverage . In 1989, Alvacast recorded their second album Inocente... Hasta que se Demuestre lo Contrario, also under Orfeo. The popular reception of the band in Argentina led to the Radio Tripoli label overseeing the Argentinian release of the group's second album, with a subsequent expansion into Chile and Venezuela, where the first album was also locally released. In Argentina, Alvacast played with Rata Blanca, Lethal and Jaf Alakran at the Halley nightclub, and in 1990 became the first Uruguayan group to complete a \\"sold-out\\" performance at the Estadio Obras Sanitarias:es:Estadio Obras Sanitariasin Buenos Aires. = Relocation to Canada = Guitarist Lamela immigrated to Canada in 1991, leading Alvacast to break-up. Several of the other band members also moved north to Canada during 1991 and 1992. Lopez arrived in Montreal in the summer of 1992 and only months later joined Canadian heavy metal band Boize as their second vocalist. Lopez remained with Boize from September to December 1992, performing and recording with the band and entertaining and major record label contract with Aquarius Records. Lopez nevertheless left Boize once the last remaining member of Alvacast had moved to Montreal. In December 1992, Alvacast was reformed as a Canadian band. Having already explored English-language recordings, as well as a limited number of releases in the United States, Alvacast began performing in English. Alvacast debuted at Montreal's Station 10 on Sainte Catherine Street, and proceeded to work through the challenges of their new environment. During this time, a collection of tapes recorded in Montevideo titled Alvacast para Coleccionistas (en: Alvacast For Collectors) was released by Perro Andaluz Records. In 1994, Sondor re-released Alvacast's sophomore full-length, Inocente... Hasta que se Demuestre lo Contrario, with re-recorded English vocals under the title Black Testaments. Alvacast was however unable to succeed in Canada due to its strong Hispanic heritage and Lopez' discernible Spanish accent while signing in English; this was poorly received by Montreal's predominantly francophone population. Alvacast ultimately broke up for the second time at the end of 1994. = Reunions = In late 1999, Alvacast made a farewell tour of Canada and Uruguay. Their final show was performed on December 29, 1999 in Montevideo, Uruguay, at La Factor√≠a for an audience of 1,000. The band Chopper opened. Alvacast reunited again in late 2014 for a series of concerts throughout 2015. Three of the five members of Alvacast are still living in Montreal, Canada; one lives in Alberta, Canada while one of them returned to Uruguay.

In 1998, the Noum√©a Accord delegated greater autonomy to the territory, and provided that its people would ultimately have the right to vote for full independence, in 2014 at the earliest and in 2018 at the latest.

In August 2010, the Congress of New Caledonia adopted the first three of those signs: an anthem, a motto (\\"Terre de parole, terre de partage\\"; \\"Land of speech, land of sharing\\"), and local symbols on New Caledonian currency.

This siege was the first in a long line of sieges which the city has known for centuries. By the end of the 13th century, Johan van Broeckhuysen was lent the allodium of Venlo as Knight by the Count of Guelders. Around 1300, Van Broeckhuysen had built an enhanced Stone House (City Hall). The underground vaults of the house still exist, but in 1597, from the ground floor a new City Hall was built. In 1343, Venlo was given city rights by Reinoud II of Guelders (who died later that year), and was therefore allowed to build city walls. The construction of this stronghold took several decades, but gradually it became a solid structure. In 1373, the reigning house of Guelders died off (reigning duke Reinoud III of Guelders had no children), and a fight burst out between the two surviving sisters Reinoud III had, Mary and Margaret. Meanwhile, Johan van Broeckhuysen also deceased, but his grandson (also named Johan) wanted the former alodium of his family not to fall into J√ºlich hands. That same year he organized a force, joined John II of Blois who was married to Mary, and thus took part in the First Guelders Succession War. John of Blois lost the battle, and thus the city of Venlo, and the duchy was joined to the J√ºlich duchy.  References  * 1999:Venlo.

Early life Parekh was born in India. In the late 1980s, his parents moved the family to the United States, settling in Verona, New Jersey. Parekh graduated from Verona High School. He next studied at and graduated from the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York City. While at SVA, Parekh produced an animated short that was screened at various film festivals. During his time at SVA, he learned to dance by watching music videos. Although self-taught, Parekh's talent for dancing enabled him to join dance troupes on both the west and east coasts of the United States. He said, > Dancing liberated me, I was no longer an introverted individual, which I had > been my whole life. Dancing came very naturally to me. I never took classes. > It's something I just picked up and ended up being good at. In 2002 he was cast in the first ever South Asian production on Broadway titled \\"Rang: Shades of my soul.\\" He went on to teach for four years at Arya Dance Academy. Parekh has said that dancing helped him to imagine acting. Career After graduating from SVA, Parekh took classes in live-action film at the New York Film Academy (NYFA). Soon after, he landed his first major role, as Shaheed in the Bollywood Hindi-language film, Khel Shuru. He learned Hindi for the part. Parekh next was cast in several small roles in television series, including House, Entourage, Medium, and Royal Pains. A professional dancer, the Parekh was cast as a featured dancer in the 2002 Bollywood film Kehtaa Hai Dil Baar Baar. In 2007, Parekh landed another Bollywood role in the feature film Ta Ra Rum Pum as the character Nilesh. In 2010, Parekh had a lead role in the independent film Karma Road, as the character Ronick. Directed by Mihir Pathak, the film won the Silver Award for Best Feature Film at the 2010 Philadelphia Film Festival and the Gold Level Award for a feature film at the 2010 California Film Awards.

Joe was badly in need of a replacement and remembered hearing Rose Brennan on radio during a visit to Ireland. Within days he had located her and, before a week was out, she was in Manchester rehearsing with the band. She stayed with Loss for fifteen years, before giving up show-business in the mid 1960s. In 1954, she was awarded third place by the New Musical Express for the best recording of the year; this was her cover of Leo Maguire's \\"The Whistling Gypsy\\". Her co-vocalists with the orchestra from 1955 were Ross MacManus (father of Elvis Costello) and Larry Gretton. It was not until 1961, now on the Philips label, that she reached the UK Singles Chart when \\"Tall Dark Stranger\\" made it to No. 31. One of her next recordings included a number she wrote herself, \\"My Wedding Day\\". Her own wedding day was 7 May 1956 when she married George Hirst, son of a Yorkshire businessman, at Wakefield Registry Office. She sang until 1966 with the Joe Loss Orchestra for weekly programs on the BBC and nightly at the Hammersmith Palais. She gave up show business and retired to run a public house, the Norland Arms in West London, with her husband John Lamb, an ex-policeman.

In September 2008 the company estimated the value of the resource as $1.47 billion. Ownership The property is owned by Swanmines, which is jointly owned by Africo Resources (75%) and the state-owned Kalumines (25%). In 2007 there was an ownership dispute when a DRC company named Akam Mining claimed it had bought control of Swanmines, and this claim was upheld in a superior court in Lubumbashi. In September 2007 from DRC justice minister Georges Minsay Booka directed G√©camines to take note that Akam Mining had no stake in the property. Following a government review of all Katanga mining contracts, in February 2009 Africo Resources made an agreement with the DRC government and G√©camines for amended terms for the project. Location The Kalukundi project is in the Kolwezi District of Katanga Province, west of the Tenke Fungurume Mine and by road from Kolwezi. A major power line runs through the south of the Kalukundi area. The Kolwezi-Likasi railway runs south of the property. An initial feasibility study was conducted between May 2004 and May 2006. Drilling indicated a reserve of 7.8 million tonnes of ore grading 2.44% copper and 0.69% cobalt in oxides at a depth of to . This was considered a conservative estimate of resources. Development plans The plan used as the basis for the 2006 feasibility study was to produce 800,000 tonnes of ore per year, giving an estimated annual yield of 16,400 tonnes of copper and 3,800 tonnes of cobalt. Ore would be extracted by a contractor using conventional open pit selective exploitation, with multiple pits and multiple cut-back to ensure a steady supply of ore. A revised study was commissioned in June 2011 to investigate a 50% higher rate of ore production, and to take into account the much higher metal prices.

The movement of crustal plates and accommodation spaces created by faulting create subsidence on a large scale in a variety of environments, including passive margins, aulacogens, fore-arc basins, foreland basins, intercontinental basins and pull-apart basins. Three mechanisms are common in the tectonic environments in which subsidence occurs: extension, cooling and loading.  Mechanisms  = Extension = horst and graben systems Where the lithosphere undergoes horizontal extension at a normal fault or rifting center, the crust will stretch until faulting occurs, either by a system of normal faults (which creates horsts and grabens) or by a system of listric faults. These fault systems allow the region to stretch, while also decreasing its thickness. A thinner crust subsides relative to thicker, undeformed crust. = Cooling = Weight causes crustal flexure and subsidence Lithospheric stretching/thinning during rifting results in regional necking of the lithosphere (the elevation of the upper surface decreases while the lower boundary rises). The underlying asthenosphere passively rises to replace the thinned mantle lithosphere. Subsequently, after the rifting/stretching period ends, this shallow asthenosphere gradually cools back into mantle lithosphere over a period of many tens of millions of years. Because mantle lithosphere is denser than asthenospheric mantle, this cooling causes subsidence. This gradual subsidence due to cooling is known as \\"thermal subsidence\\". = Loading = The adding of weight by sedimentation from erosion or orogenic processes, or loading, causes crustal depression and subsidence. Sediments accumulate at the lowest elevation possible, in accommodation spaces. The rate and magnitude of sedimentation controls the rate at which subsidence occurs. By contrast, in orogenic processes, mountain building creates a large load on the Earth's crust, causing flexural depressions in adjacent lithospheric crust. = Subduction erosion =  Environments  = Tectonically inactive = These settings are not tectonically active, but still experience large-scale subsidence because of tectonic features of the crust.  Intracontinental basins  Formation of passive marginPull-apart basin created by strike-slip faults Cross section of a pull-apart basin Intracontinental basins are large areal depressions that are tectonically inactive and not near any plate boundaries. Multiple hypotheses have been introduced to explain this slow, long-lived subsidence: long-term cooling since the breakup of Pangea, interaction of deformation around the edge of the basin and deep earth dynamics. =Extensional= Tectonic subsidence can occur in these environments as the crust pulls apart.  Passive margins  Successful rifting creates a spreading center like a mid-ocean ridge, which moves progressively further from coastlines as oceanic lithosphere is produced. Due to this initial phase of rifting, the crust in a passive margin is thinner than adjacent crust and subsides to create an accommodation space. Accumulation of non-marine sediment forms alluvial fans in the accommodation space. As rifting proceeds, listric fault systems form and further subsidence occurs, resulting in the creation of an ocean basin. After the cessation of rifting, cooling causes the crust to further subside, and loading with sediment will cause further tectonic subsidence.  Aulacogens  Aulacogens occur at failed rifts, where continental crust does not completely split. Similar to the lithospheric heating that occurs during the formation of passive margins, subsidence occurs due to heated lithosphere sagging as spreading occurs. Once tensional forces cease, subsidence continues due to cooling. =Collisional= Tectonic subsidence can occur in these settings as the plates collide against or under each other. Pull-apart basins Pull-apart basins have short-lived subsidence that forms from transtensional strike-slip faults. Moderate strike-slip faults create extensional releasing bends and opposing walls pull apart from each other. Normal faults occur, inducing small scale subsidence in the area, which ceases once the fault stops propagating. Cooling occurs after the fault fails to propagate further following the crustal thinning via normal faulting. Forearc basins File:Volcanic Arc System.png Forearc basins form in subduction zones as sedimentary material is scraped off the subducting oceanic plate, forming an accretionary prism between the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the overriding continental plate. Between this wedge and the associated volcanic arc is a zone of depression in the sea floor. Extensional faulting due to relative motion between the accretionary prism and the volcanic arc may occur. Abnormal cooling effects due to the cold, water-laden downgoing plate as well as crustal thinning due to underplating may also be at work.  Foreland basins  Orogenic wedge including Foreland basin Foreland basins are flexural depressions created by large fold thrust sheets that form toward the undeformed continental crust. They form as an isostatic response to an orogenic load. Basin growth is controlled by load migration and corresponding sedimentation rates. The broader a basin is, the greater the subsidence is in magnitude. Subsidence is increased in the adjacent basin as the load migrates further into the foreland, causing subsidence. Sediment eroded fromm the fold thrust is deposited in the basin, with thickening layers toward the thrust belt and thinning layers away from the thrust belt; this feature is called differential subsidence.

The upstream end of the passage was sealed with subsequent lava flows. The downstream passage is bi-level and the entrance is filled with sediments, most of which are carbonate sediments that had flown in from the beach. This is understood to be why there are lime features. The upstream end part is covered by a rich natural forest and the other end is covered with sand dunes. There is a significant amount of sand inside the tube. Because very little organic material has infiltrated the tube, Gimnyeonggul does not offer favorable habitats for cave life.

History  Panzer debuted in 1987 after its contributions to the compilation Infierno Rock. In 1988, the band was elected by peers and journalists as the best Chilean rock group, a title it held for two consecutive years. This coincided with the release of their first album Metal Land in 1988, followed by its 1989 Latin American re-release in an attempt to establish the band in other Spanish- speaking markets. In 1989, Panzer appeared in Latinos y Met√°licos, a compilation of heavy metal from Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Spain. The official launch for the album was at the Stadium of Buenos Aires Waterworks. Lyrics reflecting widespread youth issues and the band's classic cut of heavy metal became the trademark of Panzer. In October 1994, the album Crol Vivo o Muerto was released. After returning from Argentina, where the band aimed to promote sales, Panzer opened for the American metal band Megadeth at Victor Jara Stadium. In January 1995, the group went on a national tour of Chile, its destinations including Arica and Punta Arenas. The tour ended in November with its final show in Quinta Vergara in Vi√±a del Mar. In December 1995, Panzer was awarded the \\"Tribute to national rock\\" by the Ministerial Secretariat of Education for the band's \\"influence on the development and evolution of rock in Chile\\". In August 1996, Panzer opened for Iron Maiden's first concert in Chile at the Teatro Monumental in front of 7,000 people. On October 22, Panzer was the opening act for the AC/DC concert at the National Stadium Velodrome with an audience of 20,000 people. In November, En el nombre de... was released. =Recent years= In 1998, Rock & Roll addiction was released. The album consisted of recorded live performances during Panzer's opening acts for Iron Maiden and AC/DC. On December 12, 1998, Panzer opened for Anthrax and Slayer in the Chile National Stadium. The band members at the time were John Alvarez (guitar and composition), Khano Alvarez (lead guitar), Beto Lopez (singer), Jose Aravena (bass) and Coty Correa (drums). Panzer was the opening act for Deep Purple's show of March 1999 and performed at the 2001 \\"Grandes del rock hispano\\" festival in the Estadio Victor Jara with Bar√≥n Rojo and Rata Blanca with an audience of 6,000 people.

She was the sister of social activist Jane Addams and mother of Marcet Haldeman-Julius. Biography =Ancestors= She was the daughter of John Huy and Sarah (Weber) Addams. Her father was a successful miller and banker in northern Illinois, also serving as state senator from 1856 to 1872. He greatly influenced the policy of the state during the Civil War, to which, as his grandfather, Isaac Addams, had done in the Revolutionary War, he equipped and sent a company. Her first American ancestor was Richard Addams, who emigrated to the colonies from Oxfordshire, England, in 1684 and settled on land which he purchased from William Penn. From him. the line of descent is traced through William and Anna (Lane) Addams; Isaac and Barbara (Ruth) Addams; Samuel and Catherine (Huey) Addams, and John and Sarah (Weber) Addams. =Early life= She received her early education in Cedarville, where an academy under the direction of Jennie Forbes had been established by several of the more progressive families. From this school, Haldeman went to Rockford Seminary at Rockford, Illinois, then designated as the Mount Holyoke of the West, and completed the course there at the age of nineteen. =Marriage= After a year in Europe and the study of art in several American studios, she married Henry Winfield Haldeman, a physician, in 1875. For several years, Henry practiced medicine in Iowa and later when he spent a year in graduate medical work in Philadelphia, Alice took a course at the Woman's Medical College of that city. She was thus fitted to co-operate with her husband in his medical practice, becoming his anesthetist, helping him in operations and acquiring a wide range of knowledge. In 1884, when Henry's health necessitated his retirement from active practice, he and his wife settled in Girard, Kansas, where he engaged in banking. Here one daughter was born to them, Anna Marcet Haldeman, who survived her parents. =Girard, Kansas= Alice Haldeman soon became a vital force in the educational and philanthropic movements of Girard and Kansas. Like her sister, Jane Addams, of Hull House, Chicago, she was interested in every enterprise which looked toward social or civic betterment. Her interest was particularly with young people, and her first organized work for the community was a large and successful boys' club. She was elected president of the Girard Board of Education in 1895 and during her ten years in office had a wide acquaintance among the children of the schools and an intimate knowledge of their needs. For years the people of Girard made constant use of Haldeman's fine library. But this proving inadequate, she brought together the club women of Girard and organized a library association, serving as president of its board from 1899 to 1908, during which time the Girard Public Library, housed in a substantial Carnegie building, became a permanent factor in the intellectual life of the community. Haldeman identified herself with the Presbyterian Church, leaving the impress of her strong personality upon its varied activities and for 28 years was treasurer of its board of trustees. Her love for the foreign mission cause found expression in numerous material and spiritual ways, and many missionaries in distant lands were cheered by her unflagging, personal interest. Haldeman found in club life an avenue of constant usefulness, both for study and friendships. She early appreciated the value of women's clubs and magnified it. She was a member of the Ladies' Reading Club of Girard for more than twenty years, of the City Federation and State Federation of Women's Clubs. In 1901 she organized the Twentieth Century Club of Girard and a similar club in a neighboring town. She was president of the third district, Kansas Federation of Women's Clubs, 1900‚Äì01; was a member of the civic committee of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, 1904‚Äì06; was a member of the Topeka Chapter of the D. A. R., and of the State Board of Charities. As a presiding officer, Haldeman combined the requisite parliamentary knowledge with an unusual graciousness of manner. She loved to exercise hospitality and shared with her friends what she herself enjoyed. Beautiful pictures, fine laces, and basketry were among her enthusiasms and in her occasional exhibitions of the two latter she not only communicated her own careful information and appreciation concerning them, but evoked a real interest in their possibilities. Her hands were seldom idle, and the homes of many of her friends had examples of her painting, basketry, and needlework. =Banker= In 1905, at the death of her husband, whose business responsibilities she had long shared, Alice Haldeman became actively interested in local banking. In May of that year, she reorganized the private Bank of Girard into the State Bank of Girard. She was elected its president, an office which no other woman in Kansas had previously held, and served in that capacity until her death. In 1914, the Kansas State Bankers' Association broke a precedent and elected her a vice-president. She directed the bank for more than ten years and also scientifically managed a large stock farm in Illinois, which she owned and operated for thirty years.

In the era of the Pyu city-states it was a city of considerable significance, possibly a local capital replacing Sri Ksetra. Today the modest village is noted for its hot springs and archaeological sites. Beikthano, Hanlin, and Sri Ksetra, the ancient cities of the Pyu Kingdom were built on the irrigated fields of the dry zone of the Ayeyawady River basin. They were inscribed by UNESCO on its List of World Heritage Sites in Southeast Asia in May 2014 for their archaeological heritage traced back more than 1,000 years to between 200 BC and 900 AD. Beikthano with direct land access to the well-watered Kyaukse plains to its northeast, is the oldest urban site so far discovered and scientifically excavated site. Its remains‚Äîthe structures, pottery, artefacts, and human skeletons‚Äîdate from 200 BCE to 100 CE. Named after the Hindu god Vishnu, the city may be the first capital of a culturally and perhaps even politically uniform state in the history of Burma. It was a large fortified settlement, measuring approximately 300 hectares inside the rectangular (3 km by 1 km) walls. The walls and fortifications along it measured six meters thick, and are radiocarbon dated to a period between 180 BCE and 610 CE. Like most subsequent cities, the main entrance of the walls led to the palace, which faced east. Stupas and monastic buildings have also been excavated within the city walls. Location Maps of Beikthano Historical Sites Beikthano is located 12 miles west of Taungdwingyi Township. Magway Region on the Taungdwingyi-Magway Highway. Its co-ordinates are latitude (20¬∞) North and (95¬∞ / 23‚Äô) East and is built on ground 450 feet above sea level. The ancient city of Beikthano covered an area of 3.3 square miles. The eastern city wall was 10.000 feet in length. the northern wall was 9.000 feet. the southern wall was 8.000 feet. while the western wall has collapsed owing to soil erosion caused by the action of the Yanp√® Creek. Beikthano was defended by two walls, was a City wall and an inner palace wall. History Beikthano is traditionally believed to have been founded some 2,400 years ago by Princess Pan Htwar descended from a still legendary dynasty of Tagaung in Upper Myanmar. The fall of the city is attributed to a mightier king, Duttabaung of Sri Ksetra, who sacked the city, subdued the princess, took her captive and eventually married her. In the present stage of historical research in this country the personalities characterized in the legend are beyond authentic identification. However, the existence of an ancient city called Beikthano (Vishnu City) is testified by the ruins which stand to this day and indicates that the legend may have sprung up from a nucleus of true facts. UNESCO inscription Map of the most important Pyu city-states In October 1996, Beikthano, Hanlin and Sri Ksetra were proposed to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Rawling was born in 1916 in Ennerdale, then called Cumberland, now Cumbria. Educated at the village school and then Whitehaven Grammar School, he studied History at University College, London. He spent the Second World War in the Royal Artillery and then returned to teaching. For the next thirty years, he taught in primary, secondary and special schools, returning to Cumbria every year, fly-fishing for sea-trout, often with the late Hugh Falkus. Retiring in 1976, he began to write poetry, joining the group that had formed around Anne Stevenson in Oxford during the mid-1970s. With Stevenson's encouragement, his first poems were published under the title A Sort of Killing,Old Fire Station Poets 4, 1978 in the Old Fire Station Poets series, an early venture by Neil Astley who went on to found the important Bloodaxe Books poetry press, based in Newcastle. A full collection, Ghosts At My Back, was published by Oxford University Press in 1982. However, to Rawling's disappointment, OUP did not consider his work commercial enough for a second book. Later poems were published by smaller presses: The Old Showfield in 1984The Old Showfield, (Taxus Press, Durham, 1894)' and The Names of the Sea-Trout in 1993.'' From 1979, Rawling took over the workshop established by Stevenson at the Old Fire Station Arts Centre, George Street, Oxford. Poets associated with this group included Anne Born, Pauline Stainer, Peter Forbes, Helen Kidd, W.N. Herbert, Elizabeth Garrett, Martyn Crucefix and Keith Jebb. Rawling's poem 'Privy' was shortlisted in the Arvon/Observer International Poetry Competition in 1985. A new selection of poems and prose pieces was published under the title How Hall: Poems and Memories - a passion for Ennerdale.How Hall: Poems and Memories - a passion for Ennerdale, ed. Michael Baron and Stan Buck (Lamplugh and District Heritage Society, Cumbria, 2009) There was an accompanying CD of Rawling reading the poems, recorded in 1983.

He appeared in the series from 15 September 2004 until 24 July 2008. Furze was cast into the role after an audition and a screen test impressed producers. Furze said he was attracted to the role because of Ric's characterisation. Ric was initially portrayed as a bully of vulnerable people and held no respect for authority. Through his storylines, Ric transforms into one of the serial's \\"good guys\\" but his violent temper remained. Both Furze and interested media noted that Ric getting involved in fights became a dominant feature throughout his tenure. Ric's use of violence has been central to various plots which have led him into trouble. In one Ric faces a murder charge for a crime he did not commit. Ric later becomes embroiled in an illegal bare-knuckle boxing plot which endangers his life. Furze trained and carried out research for the storyline, which certain media outlets compared to the 1999 film Fight Club due to their similar narratives. Ric's backstory has been attributed to forming his persona, in which he was abused by his father, Owen Dalby. Upon moving to Summer Bay, the serial implemented family links when he is revealed to be the grandson of long-standing character Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) also give him a home and foster him. Ric maintains various relationships during his time in the series. Early examples include romances with Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson) and Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) and a prominent relationship with his best friend Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans). Ric has generally received favourable reviews from critics. Jim Schembri of The Age said behaved in an \\"honourable manner\\" in his relationship with Matilda. Nick Levine of Digital Spy has praised his physical appearance, while Greg Hassal of The Sydney Morning Herald praised Ric's storylines. Though, Scott Ellis from the publication opined that Ric managed to annoy nearly every regular character featured in Home and Away. For his portrayal of Ric, Furze has been nominated for various accolades, some of which were in the categories of \\"Best Actor\\" and \\"Most Popular Actor\\". Casting Actor Mark Furze joined the cast of Home and Away in 2004. Furze's agent informed him about the role and Furze read the character run through of Ric. He liked the role because he had never played a \\"baddie\\" before. After the initial audition process Furze was called back to carry out a screen test with Ray Meagher and Indiana Evans who play Alf Stewart and Matilda Hunter respectively. He was successful and Furze said he found the experience \\"very daunting\\" to begin with. In 2007, Furze took part in singing contest Soapstar Superstar and insisted that he was staying at Home and Away for a while longer. However, in 2008 Furze revealed that he had left the serial to concentrate on a career in music. Character development =Characterisation= Prior to his on-screen arrival, Ric's had an unhappy childhood and suffered abuse from his father Owen Dalby. This became a catalyst in forming his attitude problems. Initially the serial's official website said that Ric takes \\"great pleasure\\" in bullying those who he sees as vulnerable. However, after spending time in Summer Bay he changes his ways and becomes a \\"stand-up guy\\". Home and Away's overseas broadcaster, Five said that Ric managed to put \\"problematic past well and truly behind him\\" and got back \\"on the rails\\". Ric had \\"settled into a fairly typical routine for a lad of his age\\". They also described him as a \\"keen sportsman and is always up for a good time\\". Furze has said that he is in some ways similar to Ric. Furze said that playing the same character over a long time period meant that Ric adopted his own traits. Though he proclaimed \\"I'm not as aggressive as him\\". Furze said that Ric's aggressive nature was \\"awesome\\" to portray. He opined that it made him one of the best characters as Ric always gets into fights, adding \\"it's great when he snaps at everyone\\". While Ric transforms into a \\"nice guy\\" and becomes \\"a bit soft\\", he retains his \\"crazy temper where he'll snap\\". Furze said he was okay with the changes to his persona and said that Ric's \\"good sides\\" to his persona would continue to develop. Furze state that he would prefer more \\"blokey\\" scenes for Ric so he would not end up being perceived as a \\"handbag\\". =Relationships= Indiana Evans and Mark Furze (pictured) play on-screen lovers Matilda and Ric. Ric's early relationships are played out with the characters of Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson) and Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey). While dating Cassie, the \\"cheeky\\" Belle decides to \\"sabotage\\" Ric and Cassie's relationship. The storyline sees Belle attempting steal Ric from Cassie by seducing him and Tovey said that the storyline had comedic value. Producers later decided to end Ric's relationship with Cassie. Furze said that the scene involving their break up was \\"big\\". Furze and Vinson were not happy with the scene so requested changes from the scriptwriter. After which Furze said the scenes \\"went very well\\" and involved a dramatic element. They had to approach the scenes with \\"more powerful acting\\" and Furze was shocked at how emotional it became. He also opined that viewers felt thought the scenes were \\"intense and convincing\\". Ric later begins a relationship with Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans). Their early storylines focus of archetypal rites of passage. After Ric forgives Matilda for kissing Reuben Humpheries (Dan Ewing), she decides to move in with him to further their commitment. Furze said that Ric was uncomfortable with the move because Matilda is still at school and he fears they are moving too fast. Ric also questions whether she is doing it for right reasons. Ric and Matilda also have pregnancy scare, Ric discovers a pregnancy test and presumes it is Matilda's. Ric argues with Matilda and Furze he could understand Ric's reaction because he is still young. He added that \\"everything seems to be happening so fast\\" for Ric and Matilda. While Matilda soon reveals that she is not pregnant. In August 2007, it was announced that Simone McAullay had joined the guest cast of Home and Away as Viv Anderson, an older woman who would seduce Ric. McAullay described Viv as a \\"sleazy\\" female with an \\"ulterior motive\\" who just turns up where ever Ric is and comes onto him. Viv tells Ric that she is in danger because of her husband, while Ric starts spending time with her. Matilda soon becomes jealous and when she presumes Ric is sleeping with Viv, she ends their relationship. Ric then visits Viv and ends up in bed with her. Furze said that Ric had never wanted to be unfaithful to Matilda and because he thinks Matilda does not want him and Viv makes it clear she does ‚Äì \\"he has gone for it\\". McAullay opined that because Matilda had been accusing them of cheating for weeks, that Ric thinks he has nothing left to lose so he \\"might as well\\" sleep with Viv. She added that Ric is \\"completely devastated\\" the next morning, Viv realises sees the reality of the situation and \\"just how manipulative she has been ‚Äì She's been completely inconsiderate of these young people‚Äôs lives.\\" While Ric and Matilda later reunite, the next part of the story arc begins and their happiness is short lived when Viv reveals that she is pregnant. Evans said that Matilda feels sorry for Viv and evens offers to support her. However, Matilda is already upset as it falls on the one year anniversary of her mother's death. Evans added that Matilda does not feel strong as she had always counted on Ric's support, but does not want to cause any further stress. Matilda is \\"left with nothing to hold onto\\" and Viv's pregnancy also makes her doubt that her relationship with Ric will survive. Though, Evans said \\"I don't think Matilda has doubts about Ric or their relationship, but because of the situation they're in, she doubts their future and whether they'll be able to stand strong.\\" Furze said the story arc made their relationship worse because all Ric needed to do was offer Matilda his support. Matilda decides to move to Perth to attend university, and asks a reluctant Ric to join her or she will end their relationship. Ric decides to stay in Summer Bay, so Matilda leaves. Furze said that while Matilda thought Ric would follow her, she had enough of supporting Ric through his \\"big life dramas\\". Matilda is angry that Ric is not prepared to support her with something \\"she wants to do for herself\\". Furze said that he disagreed with Ric and Matilda contemplating a long distance relationship because their feelings for one another \\"are strong\\", not seeing each other would ruin their relationship. Ric becomes good friends with Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) and mistakenly kisses her. When another male answers Matilda's phone, Ric presumes she has moved on. Furze said it was a testament to Ric's character, presuming the worst. He added that Ric is \\"miserable\\" and even though he has a \\"great opportunity\\" working at the bait shop ‚Äì \\"it doesn't mean anything without Matilda\\". Ric thinks seducing Kirsty will make himself feel better. Hayes said that Kirsty is supportive of Ric and attempts to repair Ric and Matilda's relationship. She added that \\"Ric is drawn to Kirsty because of her mature attitude to relationships\\", but Kirsty does not reciprocate to his kiss. Furze concluded that Ric was ultimately attempting cover up his feelings for Matilda. In their final storyline together, Ric and Matilda reunite in Perth and the storyline formed their exits from the serial. =Bare-knuckle boxing= Scenes featuring Ric in prison were filmed at the Maitland Gaol, New South Wales. Ric is often featured in various fight sequences the serial airs. In one storyline, a \\"violent encounter\\" with Rocco Cooper (Ian Meadows) lands Ric in prison facing a murder charge. While in prison Ric faces violence from his old enemy and Rocco's brother, Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey). Furze said it continued the theme of Ric constantly getting into fights. The scenes were filmed in November 2006 at the historic New South Wales prison, the Maitland Gaol. The scenes took four days to film and involved a number of the cast who were involved in Ric's story arc. Furze said if he was in charge, Ric would have been involved in fights every week on Home and Away. Furze predicted that Ric would be involved in many more fighting scenes because of his persona. After Ric has an affair with Viv, she becomes pregnant. Furze's prediction proved true when Viv's husband Noel (Steven Vidler) forces Ric to take part in Bare-knuckle boxing. When Furze was first told that Ric would be involved in bare-knuckle fighting, Furze \\"did not hesitate\\" to agree to portray the issue. Furze said that he liked the idea of being involved in stunts and action sequences. Furze opined that the storyline was \\"in keeping with Ric's character\\" because he first entered the serial with \\"a chip on his shoulder\\". He felt that many other fictional characters that start out bad, reform to easy and that he did not want Ric's temperamental side to be sacrificed. In the research stage, professional boxer Anthony Mundine gave Furze advice and tips about the sport. Furze also had knowledge of boxing as he uses boxing as part of his fitness regime and also put in extra training at the gym. On- screen Ric attempts to stop fighting, but has to \\"fight to save the life of his unborn child\\". If he refuses then Noel will to force Viv into an abortion. While Ric does not want the baby, \\"he will support whatever decision Viv makes\\" and Ric feels he has to go ahead with the fight. Noel is \\"desperate for Ric to fight\\" because he wants to give his punters the fight \\"they feel they deserve\\". Ric does not back down because he has a fear of \\"his manliness being brought into question\\". Furze said \\"Ric's not stupid; he knows he's at serious risk\\". Ric's opponent is Logan who has a grudge against Ric due to his links with gang member Johnny. Furze said that factor \\"could be the death of him ‚Äì literally\\". At the same time, Ric is working alongside police officer Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien) to bring the illegal fights to an end. This heightens the element of danger in the plot, while Ric's girlfriend Matilda decides to stand by Ric because she thinks he is doing the right thing. When the police ruin their operation, Ric is forced to fight. The situation escalates and Furze said that \\"Ric finds himself being ordered to finish the fight at gunpoint. Noel wants him punished and it doesn't look good‚Ä¶ Ric knows he's at serious risk.\\" The storyline cumulates when Ric starts working at a jewellery shop. The shop is then subjected to an armed robbery carried out by Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell). Ric's latest drama along with Viv's pregnancy and the illegal fights take a negative impact on Ric's health. Furze told TV Week that all three events leave Ric \\"shaken up\\" and unable to cope. It gets \\"too much and something in his head just snaps\\" and he suffers a panic attack. Ric knew he had been feeling stressed for a while. The serial used Ric's \\"standard tough-guy act\\" again which sees him blocking out the stress and \\"getting on with it\\". At this point in the story, Ric is brought to the realisation that \\"things have gone too far\\". Ric attends counselling sessions with Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews) and begins to get his life back together. Storylines Ric arrives to attend Summer Bay High after he is expelled from his previous school in Yabbie Creek. Ric takes a dislike to Henry Hunter (Tobi Atkins) and starts to bully him because he likes dancing. Henry tries to make friends with Ric's circle of friends and Ric burns down the Surfclub Kiosk.

Flynn attempts to track him down, but when Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) and Dan Baker (Tim Campbell) are involved in a plane crash he helps them. Flynn detains Ric and reveals that Alf Stewart is his grandfather. The murder charges are dropped when his father's cause of death is confirmed to be a heart attack. Ric agrees to move in with Alf, but Ric leaves when Alf thinks he is taking drugs. Ric reveals that he was taking insulin for his diabetes. Ric moves in with Flynn and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and decides he wants to be known as Ric as opposed to Dalby or Eric. Matilda Hunter decides to forgive Ric for bullying her brother.

When Ric finds out that Rocco stabbed Sally, Ric beats him up. Rocco is later found dead and Ric is charged and found guilty of murder. In prison Rocco's brother Johnny seeks revenge. Matilda and Lucas Holden (Rhys Wakefield) visit Johnny and trick him into admitting involvement in Rocco's death. The police are forced to let Ric out. Ric and Matilda have a few arguments over trust and believing that she kissed Reuben. Ric is upset when Matilda decides to attend a university far from home. He decides to go with her and is worried that Matilda is pregnant when he finds a test. She reveals it is not hers and they agree they are not ready for children. Matilda walks out of her exams leaving Ric's hope for a new life elsewhere ruined. Ric starts to receive texts from one of his garage clients named Viv. Viv tries to kiss Ric who tells her he is not interested. They bond when he shares his problems about Matilda. Ric tells Viv he cannot see her after Matilda becomes jealous, but Matilda sees them kiss. Viv's husband Noel arrives, she comes onto Ric again and Noel starts threatening Ric for helping Viv out. Matilda dumps Ric who then decides to sleep with Viv. She then discovers that she is pregnant and Noel tells Ric that he cannot have children and they used him to gain a child. Ric and Matilda get back together and Johnny escapes from prison and holds them hostage. Sam Holden (Jessica Chapnik) saves them by murdering Johnny.

When Ric is badly beaten at his next fight, Rachel decides not to inform the police. Viv tells Ric the baby may have disabilities and is unsure going ahead with the pregnancy. Noel blackmails Ric to take part in another fight or risk the health of his child. Ric contacts the police who convince him to go ahead with the fight to get the details. Noel discovers that Viv is trying to leave him and postpones the fight; the police arrive to arrest Noel who is in possession of a gun. Viv later loses the baby and Matilda arranges a memorial. Ric gets a job as a security guard where Kane later raids with a gun. Ric starts to suffer from panic attacks afterward and Rachel diagnoses him with severe stress. Matilda is offered a place in university in Perth and asks Ric to move with her. Ric decides not to but they discuss ways of making their relationship work. They split up when they realise it is not practical. Alf realises that Ric is miserable without Matilda and buys him a one-way ticket to Perth. Ric and Matilda reunite and agree to spend their lives together. Reception For his portrayal of Ric, Furze was nominated for in the \\"Most Popular Actor\\" category at the 2007 Logie Awards. He was nominated in the same category the following year's ceremony. Furze said the recognition was an honour and opined that it reaffirmed that he was doing a good job on the serial. At the 2007 Inside Soap Awards Furze was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\". He subsequently received a nomination for \\"Sexiest Male\\" at the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards Jim Schembri of The Age said that the serial's male characters often behave in an \\"honourable manner\\". He said that Ric acted with \\"nobility\\" when he told Matilda they did not have to rush into sex. Schembri opined that any other male would have said this after sex and \\"given her a fake mobile number\\". While Greg Hassal from The Sydney Morning Herald said the episode was \\"well written and performed\\" and said the plot was a \\"perennial issue\\" for the serial to portray. They added with storylines such as those gave an indication to why Home and Away gained viewers. Analysing Ric's jealous trait, Roz Laws from the Sunday Mercury said \\"it's all of five minutes before his jealousy gets the better of him, yet again\\" upon arriving in Perth to reunite with Matilda. She also said that Home and Away fans should just tune in to see Ric's \\"toned torso\\" and said it was a \\"bad move\\" to take on one of Johnny's gang members in a fight. Ric's appearance was popular with entertainment website Digital Spy in their gay feature. They branded him \\"fit Ric\\" and said that Ric \\"goes a bit Fight Club\\" during his bare knuckle fight storyline. TV Week ran a poll asking viewers who their favourite Home and Away couple was. Ric and Matilda only received eight percent of the vote, placing them in joint third place along with Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) and Rachel Armstrong.

The cotton recycling symbol. Cotton recycling prevents unneeded wastage and can be a more sustainable alternative to disposal. Recycled cotton can come from secondhand clothing or from textile waste or leftovers which are then spun into new yarns and fabrics. There are some notable limitations of recycled cotton, including separation of materials that are cotton/polyester mix. There may also be limits to durability in using recycled cotton. Process Cotton can be recycled from pre-consumer (post- industrial) and post-consumer cotton waste. Pre-consumer waste comes from any excess material produced during the production of yarn, fabrics and textile products, e.g. selvage from weaving and fabric remnants from factory cutting rooms. Post-consumer waste comes from discarded textile products, e.g. used apparel and home textiles. During the recycling process, the cotton waste is first sorted by type and color and then processed through stripping machines that break the yarns and fabric into smaller pieces before pulling them apart into fiber. The mix is carded several times in order to clean and mix the fibers before they are spun into new yarns. The resulting staple fiber is shorter than the original fiber length, meaning it is more difficult to spin. Recycled cotton is therefore often blended with virgin cotton fibers to improve yarn strengths. Commonly, not more than 30% recycled cotton content is used in the finished yarn or fabric. Because waste cotton is often already dyed, re-dyeing may not be necessary. Cotton is an extremely resource-intense crop in terms of water, pesticides and insecticides. This means that using recycled cotton can lead to significant savings of natural resources and reduce pollution from agriculture. Recycling one tonne of cotton can save 765 cubic metres (202,000 US gal) of water.  Uses  Recycled cotton is often combined with recycled plastic bottles to make clothing and textiles, creating sustainable, earth-conscious products. Recycled cotton can also be used in industrial settings as polishing and wiper cloths and can even be made into new, high-quality paper. When reduced to its fibrous state, cotton can be used for applications like seat stuffing or home and automotive insulation. It is also sold as recycled cotton yarn for consumers to create their own items. Additionally, cotton waste can be made into a stronger, more durable paper than traditional wood-pulp based paper, which may contain high concentration of acids. Cotton paper is often used for important documents and also for bank notes since it does not wear off as easily. Cotton waste can also be used to grow mushrooms (particularly the indoor cultivation of Volvariella volvacea otherwise known as Straw Mushrooms). Even though recycling cotton cuts down on the harsh process of creating brand new cotton products, it is a natural fiber and is biodegradable, so any cotton fibers that cannot be recycled or used further can be composted and will not take up space in landfills.

These cell-sized prokaryote fossils are seen in the Barberton fossil record in rocks as old as 3.5 billion years. The Barberton Greenstone Belt is an excellent place to study the Archean Earth due to exposed sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Studying the earliest forms of life on Earth can provide valuable information to help understand how life can evolve on other planets. It has long been hypothesized that life may have existed on Mars due to the similarity of environmental and tectonic conditions during the Archean time. By knowing the environments in which early life evolved on Earth, and the rock types that preserve them, scientists can have a better understanding of where to look for life on Mars. The greenstone belt is located in the red highlighted area of eastern South Africa. Global beginnings of life Fossil life of 3.5 billion years of age is also found in the Pilbara craton of western Australia. This evidence, along with Barberton fossils, show that cellular life must have existed by this point in the evolution of Earth. There is work that potentially demonstrates life at 3.8 billion years ago, in what is now western Greenland, but it is highly debated. Cellular life existed 3.5 billion years ago and thus it evolved prior to this time. Because the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, there is a window of about one billion years for cellular life to evolve on a lifeless earth.  Archean tectonic history of the Barberton Greenstone Belt  The Barberton Greenstone Belt is located on the Kaapvaal craton, which covers much of the southeastern part of Africa, and was formed by the emplacement of granitoid batholiths. The Kaapvaal craton was once part of a supercontinent geologists term Vaalbara that also included the Pilbara craton of western Australia. Though the exact timing is still debated, it is likely that Vaalbara existed from approximately 3.6 to 2.2 billion years ago, and then split into two different continents.  Evidence for life  Preserved life in Archean rocks has been altered over its 3.5 billion year history and, thus, can be difficult to distinguish. The cell wall structure can be preserved, but the original composition changes over time and becomes mineralised. There are six established criteria to determine the plausibility of a given microstructure being a microfossil: #True microfossils should be of relatively abundant occurrence. #True microfossils should be of carbonaceous composition or, if mineralic, be biologically precipitated (for example, some bacteria form pyrite due to metabolic processes). #True microfossils should exhibit biological morphology. (see following section) #True microfossils should occur in a geologically plausible context (for example, there are no microfossils in igneous rock, because life cannot grow in molten lava). # True microfossils should fit within a well-established evolutionary context (for example, complex microfossils are highly unlikely to exist at 3.5 billion years, as they have yet to evolve from their more simple cellular ancestors). #True microfossils should be dissimilar from non-biogenic carbonaceous matter. (see Isotope analysis section) = Cell morphology = Cells are preserved in the rock record because their cell walls are made of proteins which convert to the organic material kerogen as the cell breaks down after death. Kerogen is insoluble in mineral acids, bases, and organic solvents. Over time, it is mineralised into graphite or graphite-like carbon, or degrades into oil and gas hydrocarbons. Three main types of Archaean cell morphologies There are three main types of cell morphologies. Though there is no established range of sizes for each type, spheroid microfossils can be as small as about 8 Œºm, filamentous microfossils have diameters typically less than 5 Œºm and have a length that can range from tens of Œºm to 100 Œºm, and spindle-like microfossils can be as long as 50 Œºm. =Isotope analysis= Stable isotope fractionation is a useful way of characterising organic carbon and inorganic carbon. These numbers are reported as values, where C is for the chemical element carbon. Isotope analysis of inorganic carbon typically yields Œ¥13C values heavier than ‚àí10 per mil, with numbers usually falling between ‚àí5 and 5 per mil. Organic carbon, however, has Œ¥13C values that range from ‚àí20 per mil for photoautotrophic bacteria to ‚àí60 per mil for microbial communities that recycle methane. The large range in values for organic carbon has to do with the cellular metabolism. For instance, an organism that uses photosynthesis (a phototroph) will have a different isotope Œ¥13C value than an organism that relies on chemical substances for energy (an autotroph).  Fossil record  The oldest microfossils from the Barberton Greenstone belt are found in the Onverwacht Group, specifically, in both the Kromberg and Hooggenoeg Formations. Both of these formations are predominantly igneous rock; the sedimentary rock has been metamorphosed. However, it is still possible to find microfossils in chert, a type of evaporite that forms in sedimentary environments. From the evidence in these rocks, it is likely that early life existed in the form of microbial mats and stromatolites. Evidence for this hypothesis is preserved in both chert and lithified stromatolites. Stromatolites represent large colonies of microorganisms, and are found both in the fossil record and rarely in modern hypersaline environments. A typical stromatolite consists of alternating layers of sediment and microbes. The microbes are photosynthetic; thus stromatolites represent shallow water environments in the fossil record due to their necessity to exist in the photic zone of water bodies. Stromatolites typically consist of filamentous microfossils. The oldest stromatolites have been dated to approximately 3.5 billion years old. Stromatolites in Barberton have been dated to about 3.3 billion years. Microfossils found in chert extend the Barberton microfossil record back to 3.5 billion years. All three types of microfossil morphologies are found in cherts. Chert can have a variety of colours, but microfossils are typically found in black cherts, as the dark color can indicate organic material.  Future applications  Scientists have established the approximate age that life first appears in the fossil record, but that doesn't necessarily equal the time that life first evolved on Earth. Though fossils have not been found in older rocks, evidence for life can be found in other ways, such as extended carbon isotope data and Raman Spectroscopy. There is also ongoing work within the scientific community to solve the problem of how cellular life evolved in a hostile early earth.

Map is modified from Guynn et al., 2011. The Bangong suture zone is approximately 1200 km long and trends in an east‚Äìwest orientation, and a key location in the central Tibet conjugate fault zone. Located in central Tibet between the Lhasa (southern block) and Qiangtang (northern block) terranes, it is a discontinuous belt of ophiolites and m√©lange that is 10‚Äì20 km wide, up to 50 km wide in places. The northern part of the fault zone consists of northeast striking sinistral strike-slip faults while the southern part consists of northwest striking right lateral strike- slip faults. These conjugate faults to the north and south of the Bangong intersect with each other along the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone.  Collision and suture development  The geology of the suture includes Jurassic marine shale and conglomeratic strata, melange and ophiolites and volcanic rocks from multiple pulses of magmatism. Each of these lithologies can be tied to specific terranes, either island arcs or microcontinents, that were gathered in front of the Indian subcontinent as it drifted northward during the Mesozoic. During the Jurassic-Cretaceous collision of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes, the ancient Tethys ocean closed, creating the Bangong suture zone. Oceanic lithosphere (the Meso-Tethys) was consumed during this collision and subducted under the Qiangtang terrane. This led to obduction of ophiolites on the northern margin of the Lhasa terrane This period of obduction is generally accepted to mark the end of oceanic subduction beneath southern Qiangtang and the onset of Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. An important feature of the Bangong suture is the Amdo basement. This exposure of pre-Mesozoic crystalline basement is ~100 km long and ~50 km wide. Geology of the Amdo records Mesozoic metamorphism, magmatism, and exhumation and is composed of orthogneisses and metasediments which are intruded by undeformed granitoids. Cenozoic reactivation Suturing of microcontinents was followed by the continued northward drift of the Indian subcontinent, colliding with Eurasia during the Cenozoic, about 45-55 million years ago. Since the India-Eurasia collision, the convergence rate with Eurasia is predicted to have slowed by more than 40% between 20 and 10 Ma due to crustal thickening. The high Tibetan plateau resisted further crustal thickening leading to the slowing of convergence and subsequent migration of crustal shortening to the flanks of the plateau. The closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean occurred at this time, as the southern edge of Eurasia (marked by the Lhasa terrane), collided with India. The penetration of the India into Eurasia reactivated the suture zone (which is located in the middle of the Tibetan Plateau), causing northward movement of both thrust faults and strike-slip faults. Strike-slip faults were responsible for moving mostly undeformed continental blocks eastward, away from the main convergent zone. Cross section depicting the tectonic evolution of the Bangong suture zone. 1. An oceanic backarc basin forms separating the Amdo basement from the Qiangtang terrane. Slab rollback is a possible explanation for this extension. 2. Continued subduction of oceanic crust in the early-middle Jurassic. Closure of the oceanic back arc basin causes ophiolite obduction and a period of metamorphism in the Amdo basement. 3. In the early Cretaceous, the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes collide creating the Bangong suture. A foreland basin also forms at this time. Cross section is modified from Guynn et al., 2006. Implications of the Bangong suture Classical interpretations of plate tectonics indicates that deformation from the Eurasian-Indian collision should be concentrated along the subduction zone. The Tibetan system does not act in this way, however, with significant deformation occurring along the north and north-east flanks of the Tibetan plateau. To solve this problem, two end- member models were proposed: a \\"soft Tibet\\" model and micro-plate tectonics. According to the \\"soft Tibet\\" model, the lithosphere behaves as a thin viscous sheet to accommodate broadly distributed shortening of both crust and lithospheric mantle. Micro-plate tectonics suggests that each terrane acts on its own, according to its own boundaries, and the sutures between them (including the Bangong suture between the Lhasa and Qiangtang) are reactivated in the Cenozoic. End member model predictions Each of the two models makes a different prediction for reactivation along the Bangong suture. The \\"soft Tibet\\" model suggests that a series of small multiple faults along the suture zone would occur, due to the ductile nature of the lithosphere. Based on the micro-plate tectonics model, large strike-slip faults with significant displacement should be present. Crustal extrusion (in the form of sinistral strike-slip faults) should also be present and would be caused by oblique subduction at the edges of the suture zone. Understanding the evolution and structure of these faults as well as other boundary faults (faults that surround the Tibetan plateau) is important to constraining the formation and deformation of the Tibetan Plateau. Research to identify features in the field that would satisfy either of these hypotheses is ongoing.

Peachtree provides cash to individuals with illiquid assets such as structured settlement payments, annuity payments, lottery winnings, and active non- settled lawsuits. The company was founded in 1996. Ten years later, in 2006 the US based company went public overseas on the London Stock Exchange, rather than the United States. Peachtree Financial was purchased by The JG Wentworth Company in 2011. Company Peachtree Financial specializes in purchasing illiquid assets such as lottery winnings, structured settlements, and life insurance policies. The company provides specialty asset portfolio servicing to third party investors, which can include pre-settlement funding and attorney cost financing. Attorney cost financing can potentially help lawyers assist with potential cash flow issues. Peachtree provides cash to personal injury, product liability, and wrongful death plaintiffs while their case is either still pending or, if successful, awaiting settlement payment. Sometimes a plaintiff may be forced to settle their case early for less cash than they deserve, because they have been unable to work due to their injury. The cash Peachtree can provide could be used to cover interim expenses of any type, whether personal, medical or business. Products =Structured Settlement= Peachtree Financial gives structured settlement recipients the option to receive their cash sooner, by selling their structured settlement payments. These regular payments from insurance companies, often as a result of a personal injury lawsuit, can be sold in portions, or all at once. All structured settlement payment transfers require a court approval, in order to protect the individual, according to the Structured Settlement Protection Act for that state. =Annuities= Annuity recipients often receive an annuity in one of three ways: they purchased the annuity as an investment, they purchased an annuity for their retirement plan, or they inherited the annuity. Similar to their structured settlement payment purchasing department, the company purchases some of, or their entire annuity payment stream for cash sooner. Unlike structured settlements transfers, annuity transfers do not require court approval. =Pre-Settlement Funding= Peachtree can provide cash to plaintiffs involved in active, non-settled personal injury lawsuits. These lawsuit advances are not loans, but rather a form of nonrecourse advance against an anticipated settlement. These advances do not have to be repaid if the plaintiff‚Äôs lawsuit is unsuccessful. =Selling Lottery Payments= Some lottery games allow you to choose your winnings as either a one-time lump sum payment or as an annuity payment stream, while other games only payout in an annuity. Lottery winners that have an annuity payout can sell all or a portion of their future payments to Peachtree, in return for a cash payout sooner.

It is notable for being one of the first espresso shops in Seattle and for its place in the history of Starbucks as the place where founding proprietor Dave Olsen designed the Starbucks coffee product line. The cafe is in an alley out of sight and has multiple entrances and rooms. History The building in which Caf√© Allegro is housed was built in 1909. The space was used for retail sales, a bank, and as a funeral home and mortuary until 1975 when it became Caf√© Allegro and the first espresso bar in Seattle. Founder Dave Olsen chose the location because it was in an alley opposite the busiest entrance to the University of Washington campus. Allegro is also the oldest coffeehouse in Seattle. Howard Schultz, the CEO during Starbucks' international expansion, said that \\"Caf√© Allegro was a prototype for what Starbucks later became, although its style was more Bohemian and it did not sell coffee beans and merchandise or cater to an early-morning, urban, coffee-to-go clientele\\". Nathaniel Jackson, who had worked at Cafe Allegro since 1975, and Chris Peterson, who had begun working there while a student in 1985, bought the cafe from Olsen in 1990. In 2014 the cafe converted the second floor of its building into a coffee roastery. In 2020 the owners of Cafe Allegro commented about the difficulty of maintaining small independent businesses in Seattle in the context of many other neighborhood businesses closing due to urban development policy. Dave Olsen Schultz said of Olsen, \\"Dave Olsen is right at the heart of the memory of Starbucks... Dave is a rock, part of the foundation of the company\\" because under his supervision Schultz \\"never had to worry about the quality of the coffee\\". Dave Olsen founded, owned, and managed Caf√© Allegro for eleven years as his only coffeeshop. He purchased coffee by the pound from Starbucks, and co-developed an espresso roast with them which was darker than most other roasts but still lighter than the darkest roast. That espresso roast remains the standard Starbucks espresso offering. In the mid 1980s, Starbucks ownership and corporate governance changed, and Olsen became more involved in their activities. On Monday 18 August 1987 Olsen became the head buyer and roaster of Starbucks.

History First aired in November 2006, along with Al Jazeera English, the show was an essential part of the station's original programming line-up and continues to be so until this day. Throughout the lifetime of the show, from launch to date, the show's presenter has been Richard Gizbert. Gizbert, a veteran of ABC News, was recruited in April 2006, in the run-up to the station's launch, to present the media-analysis show. Format The aim of the show is to offer a critique of journalism and of the media industry around the world today: \\"The Listening Post aims to monitor virtually all forms of media, from networks to bloggers, and report on what they do or do not cover.\\" Each episode presents: * two in-depth reports, showing how the key stories of the week have been handled by the various players in the world's media. * a segment known as \\"The Download\\" (formerly \\"Global Village Voices\\") that airs viewers' comments on the stories featured. * brief news-items on general developments in world of journalism. Gizbert initiated a fast-paced and hard- hitting style that avoids the pitfalls of many similar shows, that rely on an interview style. Gizbert takes the initiative and the responsibility for the analysis, but minimizes the risk by demonstrating the evidence for the deductions. Other broadcasters, by contrast, try to step back from responsibility by hosting interviews: this provides many assertions, but little analysis. The result is usually one of two equally unsatisfactory outcomes. The Listening Post differs in that it tends to compare and contrast the original footage. This demonstrates quickly and succinctly not only what each player has put into their variant of the story, but also what each has left out. The footage also shows how the press can often be as conformist and subservient to those in power. In addition, the show has discussed a recurring journalistic tendency to regurgitate convenient 'factual' detail, without checking either the source of the material - and a possible agenda in offering it - or the methodologies, which can frequently be unscientific and specious.

The application is designed to help organizations discover and document their business processes, business decisions and policies in a collaborative manner. It is designed to be simple and intuitive to use, while still having the capabilities to implement more complex models. Blueworks Live adheres to the BPMN 2.0 standard developed and maintained by BPMN.org. Purpose Blueworks Live is intended to be a business-user focused process & decision discovery and documentation tool. There are a number of more complicated BPMN 2.0 specification attributes that are left out in the aim of creating simple, understandable processes & decisions in Blueworks Live. All data is stored in the cloud eliminating the need for infrastructure beyond a computer with a web browser. Blueworks Live is also fully integrated with IBM's BPM product enabling customers to quickly take their processes from discovery to implementation if so desired.  History  The original concept for business process modeler with a SaaS deployment model came with BluePrint, an application developed by Lombardi Inc. The company with its range of BPM products caught IBM's attention, so in January 2010 they made an acquisition of Lombardi. IBM already had a product in the same space known as IBM Blueworks, but that was superseded by the new technology of Lombardi's Blueprint and became Blueworks Live. IBM launched the Blueworks Live on 20 November 2010.  Features  = Discovery and documentation =  Capturing processes & decisions  Blueworks Live provides various tools for companies to capture business processes & decisions, using a collaborative approach to discovering those processes with maximum accuracy. There are three different views for process data, the Discovery Map, Process Diagram, and Documentation. The Discovery Map is intended to enable business users to quickly and efficiently get the process activities and milestones out on 'paper'. This view is all about getting the information out there as quickly as possible without worrying about the process logic. When you have sufficiently identified the process in the Discovery Map, use the details popup to provide the Participant data, and then Blueworks Live can generate the Process Diagram where you will add the details of the process logic and flows. Each Participant identified in the Discovery Map will have a swimlane and the activities assigned will be in their swimlane. The Documentation view is intended to read like a Microsoft Word document with all of the process documentation that you have added in the details popup. Decisions only have one view, the Decision Diagram. This is a graphical representation of the decision, the flows, and sub-decisions involved. Each decision and sub- decision has inputs and outputs that can be defined to populate the decision table. Blueworks Live is compliant with the DMN 1.0 specification.  Data import and export  Blueworks Live allows users to import diagrams from: * Microsoft Visio using the vdx XML format * BPMN 2.0 XML * XPDL 2.1 XML In terms of export, users can automatically generate outputs in following formats: * Microsoft PowerPoint * Microsoft Word * Microsoft Excel Process Data (Export Process option) * BPMN 2.0 (Export Process option) (Note: This output format does not contain the diagrams or diagram elements) * XPDL 2.1 (Export Process option) * IBM WebSphere Business Modeler XML 7.0 (Export Process option) = Centralized collaboration = Blueworks Live uses many social networking features, enabling team collaboration: * Instant messaging * Live news feeds * Commenting (process changes) * Newsfeed - current work statistics and reports on the site's main page  Public and private communities  Blueworks Live use its main page to inform users about all the changes occurring to company processes, where the user is involved (private), or about information regarding useful and news about wider BPM communities. This involves blogs, tutorials or application changes and updates.  Licensing  Blueworks Live distinguishes between four types of license: Editors, Contributors, Viewers, and Community. Editors are able to: * Create and modify processes & decisions * Publish processes & decisions * Automate processes * Manage spaces * Utilize the Analyze and Playback features Contributors are able to: * Add Comments to processes & decisions * Participate in process automation Viewers are able to: * View published processes and decisions * Viewers can follow the link to open published process in Blueworks Live. * Viewers can review process & decision details: Discovery map, Process diagram & Process documentation The viewer capabilities are to enable a wider adoption across an enterprise. In cases where a customer utilizes SSO for login, and has viewer licenses, the account administrator can enable JIT provisioning. Community users can: * View the Community tab * Perform the role of account Admin = Automating simple processes = Blueworks Live provides its users also with automate process feature. There are two different types of process allowed in Blueworks Live, workflow and checklist. The workflow process application will allow you to create either parallel or sequential activities. This is useful for review and approval types of processes. This process type will distribute the tasks in a very precise manner determined by the design of the workflow you create. The checklist process application is useful when you want to disseminate information all at once, without caring in what order people respond. = Privacy and security =  Data privacy and security  All the information and data stored in Blueworks live is private, and inaccessible by IBM unless specifically given written permission for access by a customer.  Network security  Servers are protected by firewall configured to block all traffic on ports other than 80 or 443 (HTTP, HTTPS). Blueworks live also uses 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.2) for server authentication and data encryption. User authentication is ensured by providing every user a unique password tied with his personal or company e-mail address.  Authentication  IBM lets the users choose their own preferred level of authentication in application settings. There are two security levels: Medium and High. *Medium: The password is required when changing it to new one, user is locked out, if he fails to log in several times in a row. *High: Password policy, maximizing password strength, requires user to change it every 90 days.  Compatibility  Since Blueworks Live is a web application, it can be accessed from any workstation with Internet connectivity and a web browser, regardless of the operating system. Some of the basic features are also accessible through a mobile phone. Browsers currently supported include Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome.

Biography Born and raised in Florence, Italy, from an early age Andrea Tacchi took an interest in creating musical instruments, building his first guitar at age 15. In 1977 he began studying guitar making with Argentinian luthier Ricardo Bran√©.http://job24.ilsole24ore.com/news/Articoli/2011/08/Liutai- andreatacchi-8082011.php After Bran√©‚Äôs death, Tacchi traveled to Spain, England, France, and the United States to study with various masters, going in 1981 to Spain to meet with many Spanish luthiers including Paulino Bernabe Senior, Jos√© Ram√≠rez, Francisco and Gabriel Fleta to get their critical opinions and advice on his guitar making. With the same goal in mind, he went twice to England to consult with Jos√© Romanillos.http://www.conservatorio.firenze.it/index.php?id=995 Most importantly, during the early 1980s Tacchi went several times to Paris to visit with Robert Bouchet and Daniel Friederich in their workshops, always with the objective in mind of growing as a luthier through their advice. It was in Castres, France in 1985 that Andrea Tacchi competed in the Concours International des Facteurs de Guitare organized by Robert Vidal of Radio France.http://www.concours-robert-j-vidal.com/en/about.htm There he won first prize for Aesthetic Qualities and second general prize for Acoustic Qualities. Experienced in the restoration of guitarshttp://www.riccardodalterio.it/andrea-tacchi and other antique string instruments, Tacchi has carried out such restorations as the Pag√©s guitar of Jacob Lindberg, string basses for musicians of the Teatro Comunale di Firenze, and a classical guitar built by Hermann Hauser.http://www.crane.gr.jp/CRANE_Back_No/HauserRestoreAndreaTacchi/E.html Andrea Tacchi has built over 350 guitars, some owned by guitarists including Filomena Moretti, Flavio Cucchi, Carlo Marchione, Antigoni Goni, Robert Gruca, Colin Davin, Minoru Inagaki, and Marcelo Kayath, while others belong to important private collections. Two of his guitars are in the collection of the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini in Florence, Italy.http://www.conservatorio.firenze.it/index.php?id=995 Coclea & Coclea Thucea Detail of the Cerulea Coclea Thucea made by Andrea Tacchi in 2012 Andrea Tacchi is well known for a guitar he began building in 1989, the Coclea, which possesses unusually resonant acoustic properties. The name refers to the ‚Äúcochlea‚Äù of the inner ear (coclea in Latin), the physiological place where noise is perceived as sound. The Coclea is designed on precise geometrical principles, of which its main characteristic is having top and back conceived of as portions of spheres of different radii.http://www.kentguitarclassics.com/andrea-tacchi-classical- guitarshttp://www.guitarsint.com/detail.cfm/id/280 Tacchi explains his inspiration for the Coclea: \\"From the early 80s on, I became interested in understanding the rules adopted by luthiers of the 19th century for designing the form of their instruments, a series of circles and triangles in a mathematical relation to the length of the body. Then I developed a system of spheres of differing diameters and planes in such a way so that these tangents would compose the Coclea.\\"Karsten Pedersen ‚ÄúAndrea Tacchi: Italian Maestro‚Äù Guitart International, 2004 p. 21 While he originally created two versions of the Coclea, one with a spruce top and another with a cedar top, it was in 1997 that Tacchi began to develop the idea for the Coclea Thucea, so named because of the combination of the two woods of which the sound board is composed: thuja plicata (western redcedar) and picea excelsa (spruce). Andrea Tacchi's Thucea design was partially inspired by a concept applied by Antonio Torres who created guitar soundboards with three strips of spruce of differing densities. He produced the first Coclea Thucea in 2000.http://www.dreamguitars.com/sold-guitars/1856-tacchi_coclea_thucea_290/ In 2012 Andrea Tacchi created a special model of the Coclea Thucea named \\"Cerulea.\\" Destined for China, the predominant color of the decoration is cerulean blue, inspired by the image of the celestial empire. In the rosette there is a square tile of blue lapis lazuli and as 2012 was the year of the Dragon there is another tile representing a dragon carved from an antique piece of bone. Bouchet Homage Andrea Tacchi Bouchet Homage interior photo by Andrea Tacchi In honor of his former teacher, in 1994 Andrea Tacchi created his first reproduction of a Bouchet guitar, the Bouchet Homage. Following the Cahier d‚Äôatelier (workshop notebook) of Bouchet, later published by the Conservatoire de Paris, Tacchi created what is generally recognized as a personalized replica of the master‚Äôs instrument.Robert Bouchet (1898‚Äì1986) Cahier d'atelier avec une introduction par Catherine et Bruno Marlat et un commentaire de Daniel Friederich, Mus√©e de la Musique, Paris, 2003 In 1998 the Florentine luthier was invited to exhibit this guitar in Shibuya, Tokyo at the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of Bouchet‚Äôs birth.http://www.guitarsint.com/article.cfm/ArticleId/10 Concerning Bouchet, Tacchi has written: \\"He linked the 'gesture' with the material, a characteristic typical of sculptors, and one ought not to forget that Bouchet started out as both a painter and a sculptor.\\"Karsten Pedersen ‚ÄúAndrea Tacchi: Italian Maestro‚Äù Guitart International, 2004 pp. 19‚Äì20 Garc√≠a & Simplicio Replicas Andrea Tacchi Simplicio Replica, photo by Andrea Faggi property Andrea Tacchi In 1999 after intense study of Catalan lutherie, Andrea Tacchi began to make replicas of Garc√≠a and Simplicio Guitars.http://www.rodgers- tuning-machines.co.uk/22000.html Concerning the task of creating replicas of guitars by these two masters Tacchi has written: \\"When I set out to create a homage to maestro Garc√≠a, my state of mind is quite different from the great white canvas ready to be filled with colors that Simplicio represents for me. I feel freer, more tranquil, and more self-confident. Simplicio is more severe. During the period in which I was assiduously studying his work I dreamed of him often and I always felt intimidated and embarrassed before him.\\"\\"Una strada da seguire\\" in Francisco Simplicio luthier: Note di viaggio sulle tracce di Francisco e Miguel Simplicio nella Barcellona fra Modernismo e Seconda Republica Diego Milanese and Umberto Piazza, eds.

Dynamic recrystallization is a process of crystal regrowth under conditions of stress and elevated temperature, commonly applied in the fields of metallurgy and materials science. Dynamic quartz recrystallization happens in a relatively predictable way with relation to temperature, and given its abundance quartz recrystallization can be used to easily determine relative temperature profiles, for example in orogenic belts or near intrusions. Mechanisms of recrystallization Previous research has outlined several dislocation creep regimes present in experimental conditions. Two main mechanisms for altering grain boundaries have been defined. The first is the process by which quartz softens as temperature increases, providing a means for internal stress reduction by migration of dislocations in the crystal lattice, known as dislocation creep. These dislocations concentrate into walls, forming new grain boundaries. The other process involves differences in stored strain energy between neighboring grains, resulting in migration of existing grain boundaries. The extent to which these occur is a function of strain rate and temperature, those being, respectively, the factors controlling introduction of new dislocations and the ability of dislocations to migrate and form subgrain boundaries which themselves migrate. Recrystallization regimes Observable microstructures in quartz can be classified into three semi-distinct groupings that form a continuum of dynamic recrystallization textures. These regimes will be discussed in terms of temperature changes, assuming a constant level of shear. =Bulging recrystallization= (10x) Quartz exhibiting dominant bulging recrystallization. Note bulges along grain boundaries and recrystallized subgrains along boundaries (marked by arrows). Thin section prepared by Alex Webb. The lowest temperature texture (~250-400¬∞C), bulging recrystallization (BLG) is characterized by bulges and small recrystallized grains along grain boundaries and, to some extent, microcracks. The at-large proportion and structure of the original quartz crystals is preserved to the greatest extent, compared with the other profiles. Formed by a combination of the two mechanisms mentioned, limited crystal plasticity (due to low temperature) prevents any further separation of subgrains. It follows, then, that an increase in temperature results in an increase in recrystallized grain size and volume proportion (0-25%) as internal stress becomes more resolved. =Subgrain rotation recrystallization= (5x) Quartz(w/mica) exhibiting dominant subgrain rotation recrystallization. Note similar grain/subgrain sizes and relatively straight grain boundaries. Thin section prepared by Alex Webb. Following an increase in temperature, the dominant texture changes to one marked by the presence of distinct subgrains. Recognizable in thin section by a more polygonized texture, the increased softening of the quartz allows for more thorough reduction of internal stresses. Recrystallized grains show relatively straight grain boundaries and little to no intragranular deformation feature, such as undulose extinction or deformation lamellae. Volume proportion of recrystallized grains in this regime roughly ranges from 30-90%, forming subgrains not only in interstitial space, but also within larger crystals or ribbon grains. Subgrains and recrystallized grains are roughly equal in size and shape. =Grain boundary migration recrystallization= (5x) Photomicrograph of fully recrystallized quartz. Note lobate, interfingering boundaries. Bright colored grains are micas. Thin section prepared by Alex Webb. The highest temperature of the three textures, grain boundary migration becomes the dominant mechanism at ~500-550¬∞C. Exhibiting much larger recrystallized grain sizes than the other two regimes, in addition to lobate and highly interfingering boundaries, at these temperatures quartz is completely recrystallized. That is, no evidence for original grains can be found. At these high temperatures, grain boundaries are free to sweep across entire grains, resulting in much less localized boundary formation/change. In this case as well, intragranular deformation features have been erased, but may be present from later-stage overprinting. Trends Aside from the obvious increase in temperature, there are other trends which arise in this progression of recrystallization. =Recrystallized volume proportion= As mentioned above, with increased temperature there is a marked increase in the proportion of the rock having undergone recrystallization. From 0-30% in bulging recrystallization, up to 90% in subgrain rotation recrystallization and 100% in grain boundary migration, this property may be observed in quartzite, at least well enough to get relative temperature relationships in the field. =Recrystallized grain size= Progressing from around 15 Œºm (bulging recrystallization) to about 85 Œºm (subgrain rotation recrystallization) to up to a few millimeters (grain boundary migration), this exponential increase is not only noticeable, but is part of the basis on which the three recrystallization regimes were demarcated. Utility Observation of recrystallization in a rock sample can reveal a general temperature, but nothing very precise. This is because the process of recrystallization is strongly affected by the presence of water and the amount of strain present. As such, this information can be applied to determine relative temperatures of different rock much more reliably than it can determine absolute temperatures. Furthermore, this is an analysis that can be done, if only preliminarily, in the field by observing rocks in hand sample.

In a career which lasted from 1946 and 1948 he ran thirteen times and won four races. His most notable achievement came in 1947, when he became the first French-trained horse to win The Derby since Durbar in 1914. Background Pearl Diver was bred in occupied France at Edward Esmond's Mortefontaine Stud in 1944. Esmond himself had fled the country for the United States in 1940 and the stud was being run by his son-in-law Baron Geoffroy de Waldner who faked the stud records to conceal the new foal's illustrious pedigree from the German authorities, giving him the pseudonym \\"Monsieur de Boscz\\". On Esmond's death in 1945, the yearling colt was inherited by de Waldner. As a two-year- old, Pearl Diver was sent into training at the Chantilly stable of Percy Carter, an Englishman who had been based in France for many years. Pearl Diver grew to be a big, powerful bay standing 16.2 hands high. Carter was responsible for the colt for all but a brief period in 1947, when he was stabled with Claude Halsey at Newmarket, Suffolk. Pearl Diver‚Äôs sire, Vatellor was a high class racehorse who won eight races in France including the race now called the Prix Jean Prat. He later became a successful stallion being Champion sire in France in 1956 and getting such notable performers as My Love, Nikellora (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) and Vattel (Grand Prix de Paris). Pearl Cap had produced no notable horses before she gave birth to Pearl Diver in 1944. She had, however, been an outstanding racemare, with her victories including the 1931 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Racing career =1946: two- year-old season= Pearl Diver was not highly tried as a two-year-old, running twice. He showed some promise in winning the Prix Saint Patrick over 1400m. =1947: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Pearl Diver was beaten in a race at Le Tremblay by a filly called Imprudence. The form of the race looked better in retrospect as Imprudence went on to win the 1000 Guineas, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and The Oaks. Pearl Diver then finished third to L‚ÄôImperial in the Prix Jean Prat over 2000m at Longchamp. In May he recorded his first significant victory when he was awarded the Prix Matchem on the disqualification of Timor. His form suggested that he was a useful stayer (the Prix Matchem was run over 2700m), but below top class. In order to acclimatise the colt to English conditions, Pearl Diver was transferred to Newmarket three weeks before the Derby. Claude Halsey took charge of the colt‚Äôs final preparation at his Somerville Lodge Stable, and briefly became his official trainer. Despite this technicality, Carter is usually listed by most sources as Pearl Diver‚Äôs trainer for his run in the Derby Pearl Diver started at odds of 40/1 at Epsom on a cold, wet day in front of an estimated 400,000 spectators including the King and Queen. The build-up to the race was dominated by Tudor Minstrel, the 4/7 favourite who came into the race unbeaten, having most recently won the 2000 Guineas by eight lengths. Ridden by Georges Bridgland, Pearl Diver raced prominently and tracked the leaders in the early stages as Gordon Richards struggled to restrain Tudor Minstrel before being forced to allow the favourite to make the running. When Tudor Minstrel weakened entering the straight, Pearl Diver moved up to overtake him and dispute the lead with Sayajirao. In the final quarter mile Pearl Diver went clear and pulled steadily away from the field to win by four lengths from Migoli with Sayajirao third. Many of the crowd began to celebrate a Tudor Minstrel victory, reportedly mistaking the similar white colours carried by Pearl Diver's jockey, but the defeat of the favourite saved the British bookmakers from an estimated ¬£5,000,000 payout Bridgland said that once he took the lead he \\"knew the Derby was mine...I was never seriously challenged,\\" while Baron de Waldner emphasised the importance of the soft ground, saying that he \\"enjoyed every minute of the rain.\\" The victory of the French colt was variously described in the British press as \\"a crushing blow\\", a \\"humiliation\\" and \\"a national tragedy\\". Explanations for the failure of the British included the \\"pampering\\" of horses in training, a lack of stamina in pedigrees and the use of inferior oats as feed during wartime. At Longchamp the end of the month, Pearl Diver attempted to become the first Derby winner since Spearmint in 1906 to win the Grand Prix de Paris, but finished eighth behind the 34/1 winner Avenger. Pearl Diver was then off the racecourse for two and a half months before being sent back to England for the St Leger. He was unsuited by the firm ground and finished fourth of the eleven runners behind Sayajirao. =1948: four-year-old season= Pearl Diver stayed in training at four and produced some good performances without recapturing the best his three-year-old form. He began the year with a win, taking the Prix d'Harcourt over 2150m at Longchamp in April. In June he returned to Epsom for the Coronation Cup, but ran disappointingly and finished unplaced behind Goyama. He remained in England for his next start and showed better form to finish third to Sayajirao in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. In September Pearl Diver finished third to Yong Lo in the Prix du Prince d'Orange at Longchamp. On his final start he was unplaced behind Migoli in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pearl Diver an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù Derby winner, despite the fact that he had decisively beaten a stronger than average field at Epsom. Stud career Pearl Diver began his stud career in England at the Limestone Stud in Lincolnshire. In 1957 he was sold and exported to Japan. He made little impact as a stallion in either country.

Like the associated Andes, the Antarctic Peninsula is an excellent example of ocean-continent collision resulting in subduction. The peninsula has experienced continuous subduction for over 200 million years, but changes in continental configurations during the amalgamation and breakup of continents have changed the orientation of the peninsula itself, as well as the underlying volcanic rocks associated with the subduction zone. Tectonic evolution and geology of the Antarctic Peninsula The geology of the Antarctic Peninsula occurred in three stages: #Pre- subduction stage of marginal basin deposition, later separated by the Gondwanian orogeny during the Permian-Late Triassic #The middle subduction phase, characterized by the formation of the Antarctic Peninsula (inner) and South Shetland Islands (outer) magmatic arcs, during the middle Jurassic- Miocene. #The late subduction phase, when the opening of the Bransfield Rift and back-arc basins occur. This is followed by contemporaneous terrestrial and submarine volcanic activity, from the Oligocene-present day. =Pre-subduction history= Antarctic Peninsula previous plate configurations. As Gondwana broke apart, the Antarctic Peninsula started to take on its modern shape. Roughly 220 million years ago, the continents of Antarctica, South America, and Africa rifted apart. This rifting created low relief basins which allowed for the transport of sediments and subsequent deposition of sedimentary rocks, which happen to be the oldest on the peninsula. These rocks belong to the Trinity Peninsula Group (TPG), which are mostly composed of siliciclastic turbidite deposits, ~1200‚Äì3000 m thick, deposited in a marginal marine basin. Unfortunately their age is poorly constrained, but they are most likely from the upper Permian and Triassic. The clastic component of these sediments was derived from the weathering, erosion, and subsequent transportation of metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary material from Gondwana, then to the northeast. Gondwanian orogeny During this time the Trinity Peninsula Group sediments were folded and slightly metamorphosed, particularly at the peninsula's northernmost point. Retroarc thrusting also occurred at this time. Both events were most likely caused by the incipient subduction of the south- east Pacific Plate under the Gondwana supercontinent. As a result, marginal basin clastics from the Pacific plate's oceanic basement were obducted onto the continental margin of Gondwana, composed of older crystalline basement. =Middle subduction phase= upper mantle Inner magmatic arc The inner magmatic arc, despite being older than the outer magmatic arc, has higher topographic relief. It forms the mainland of the Antarctic Peninsula. The creation of the inner magmatic arc is characterized by terrestrial clastic deposition and the early stages of acidic volcanism and plutonism. The Mesozoic clastic sequence (Number 2-Figure 2) consists of the Mount Flora Formation (MFF), which is a 270 m thick package of plant-bearing coarse sedimentary breccias and conglomerates, with a limited amount of interbedded sandstones and shales. The clastic beds overlay the TPG sediments, and are separated by angular unconformities. Overlying the MFF clastic sequence are the acidic volcanics of the Kenny Glacier Formation (KGF). This volcanic sequence is a 215 m thick group of rhyolite-dacite lavas, ignimbrites, tuffs, and agglomerates. The acidic dikes and sills which intrude the MFF and TPG sediments may be due to the KGF stratovolcano. The acidic volcanism that created the KGF sequence is associated with plutonic intrusions during the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. These plutonic intrusions could have been caused by the doming and rifting in the continental margin of Gondwana at the onset of oceanic slab subduction. Outer magmatic arc The outer magmatic arc, of which the South Shetland Islands are a part, is a westward migration of the inner magmatic arc. Similar to the inner magmatic arc, the outer is composed of subduction-related acidic volcanism. A study on Alexander Island that focused on the conditions required for the generation of andesitic lavas postulated that the source for the andesitic lavas could be either the development of a slab-window due to the subduction of a spreading ridge or the breakup of the subducted slab beneath the fore-arc basin. The South Shetland Islands are bissected by two systems of strike-slip faults. The older system, which is parallel with the island arc, is characterized by right-lateral faults, and was active on King George Island during most of the Tertiary. The younger system of faults, also a series of strike-slip faults, displaced the older system and formed transverse to the island arc. Movement of the fault activity was caused by the counterclockwise rotation of the Antarctic Continent with respect to the subduction zone. =Late subduction phase, opening of the Bransfield Rift= Development of the Bransfield Rift, depicting trench rollback and upwelling of displaced mantle material. The last and most recent stage in the evolution of the Antarctic Peninsula subduction zone is the opening of the Bransfield Rift, creating the Bransfield back-arc basin from the Oligocene to the present day. This basin separates the inner, older magmatic arc (mainland Antarctic Peninsula) from the outer, younger magmatic arc (South Shetland Islands). Alkaline and tholeiitic volcanic activity is associated with this rifting event. The trenchward migration of the spreading center is attributed to the subduction of the Phoenix Plate under the Antarctic Plate. Slab rollback and South Shetland Trench oceanward retreat have led to extensional forces acting on the leading edge of the overriding plate. The Bransfield Strait, the result of this extension, is presumed to be four million years old or less; magnetic anomalies created by the formation of new basaltic crust and aligned with the axis of the Bransfield Rift indicate that the newly formed oceanic crust in the Bransfield Strait is roughly 1.3 million years old. Unfortunately the deposition of sediments and extensive intrusions into the rift render computer modeling unreliable. Isolated occurrences of terrestrial volcanic activity are present, and are predominantly alkaline to tholeiitic in composition.

He also worked as a teacher in Arya Vidyapeeth Higher Secondary and Multipurpose School, Guwahati from 1963 to 1996.  Early life  Born at Nagaon village of Bhella in Barpeta district, Pathak passed the matric examination in the year 1958, and went to the M.C. College, Barpeta and began concentrating on music while he continued his studies. During this time, he attended numerous baithakis (traditional singing and celebration sessions before a marriage ceremony). He learnt borgeets from the maestro Dayal Chandra Sutradhar. In 1961, the inter-college youth festival was held at Guwahati and it was for the first time that M.C. College was participating in the festival. On that very occasion, Pathak topped in the borgeet, adhunik geet, bhajan and ghazal categories which inspired him tremendously. Immediately, after appearing in the BA final examination he got a call from the Assam Police to join as an Inspector. His friend Lohit Choudhury tore the call letter, saying that he didn't want Pathak to become a police man.  Music career  In December 1963, Pathak joined the city's Arya Vidyapeeth Higher Secondary School as a subject teacher. He became popular among his students as well as his colleagues as a great singer. His colleague Afjal Hussain pressed him to give an audition for the All India Radio, Guwahati. During the audition, Pathak sang a modern Assamese song. Kamal Narayan Choudhury, the judge, scolded him and remarked that he was sacrificing a bright career by opting for modern songs. He inspired Pathak to concentrate on folk music. Pathak passed the audition, and became a familiar name for the listeners of radio in a short time. Subsequently, invitations began coming to him to perform in every nook and corner of the state. In 1973, he first met his future wife Dhanada Barman, now Dhanada Pathak. Dhanada was a third-year graduate student, when her elder brother Hem Chandra Barman pressurised her to give an audition for radio. Hem Chandra took her to Rameshwar Pathak, whom she had heard many a times before. Pathak guided her for the audition. She was selected, and a year later, the two married. Dhananda came from a family of Barpeta, which owned a Jatra party in their home called \\"The Rowly Opera\\". Her elder brothers were actively associated with the opera in many ways. They acted, sang, played instruments like the dotora, flute and others and initiated the functioning of the opera. After their marriage, the couple collaborated on a number of gramophone records and over a hundred and fifty audio cassettes. They presented Assamese lokageet (folk songs) in duet and chorus style for the very first time, and became known as the doyens of Assamese folk music. Pathak has performed all across Assam, and also in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Orissa, Himachal, Calcutta and North-East India.  Death  During his last days, Pathak was a heart patient and went through a bypass surgery. In 1997, he met with an accident, in front of the city's Rabindra Bhawan in which his upper jaw was broken. And when he went outside the state for treatment it was discovered that he immediately needed a bypass operation. The Chief Minister of Assam donated 80,000 towards his treatment, which cost 300,000. Pathak suffered a massive heart attack at his home on 3 December 2010 and died on the way to hospital. He was 72. He is survived by his wife and children.  Awards and recognition  Awarded with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in the year 1990, Rameshwar Pathak was selected for the Artist's pension of the state government the same year.

Shanta was married to Rishyasringa, son of the legendary Indian Hindu sage Vibhandaka. Life Shanta was educated in the Vedas, arts, craft as well as in warfare, and was considered to have been very beautiful. One day, while her father, the king Romapada, was busy in conversation with Shanta, a brahmin came to ask for help in cultivation in the days of the monsoon. Romapada did not pay attention to the brahmin's plight. This irritated and enraged the brahmin, who left the kingdom. Indra, the god of rain, was unable to bear the insult to his devotee, so there was little rainfall during the monsoon season resulting in drought in kingdom. Meanwhile, Dasharatha wanted a son to continue his legacy and to enrich his royal dynasty. It was advised that the troubles of both kingdoms could only be alleviated by yajnas performed by a brahmin with powers that come from observance of perfect chastity and that the only such person was Rishyasringa. Rishyasringa had been raised by Vibhandak Rishi, isolated from society without knowledge of women. He had to be brought to the city and be persuaded to carry out the necessary yajna ceremonies. Despite their fear of the power and anger of Vibhandak Rishi, both kings send young women to introduce the boy to the normal society, then Shanta fulfils this task and Rishyasringa marries Shanta, he then agrees to perform yajna for Anga, during the recitation of it, it rained heavily, the public rejoiced and there were festivals in Anga. Rishyasringa also performed a Putra Kameshthi yajna for Dasharatha to beget progeny, and as the consequence of the said Yajna were born: Rama, Bharata, and the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna.

Due to this, TNA were forced to change the location of the bout from the BI-LO Center to the TNA Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. TNA taped the match between Abyss and Judas Mesias on January 22, 2008 at the tapings of the January 31 and February 7, 2008 episodes of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. Consequences Creed taking part in a match prior to the show was promoted by TNA on their website. Due to poor ticket sales, it was reported TNA gave away several tickets for free. TNA released a poster featuring Abyss sometime prior to help promote the event. =Storylines= Against All Odds featured nine professional wrestling matches and two matches prior to the event that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. alt=Large adult male wearing a black shirt and jacket, as well as a red mask over his face with shirt brown hair. The main event at Against All Odds was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Samoa Joe as Special Outside Enforcer between then-champion Kurt Angle and the challenger Christian Cage. On January 6, 2008 at TNA's previous PPV event Final Resolution, Angle defeated Cage to retain the championship after Cage's alliance A.J. Styles attacked Cage, aligning with Angle and The Angle Alliance. On the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Cage, Joe, and Styles would compete in a Three Way match on the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!. Stipulations for the match were that the winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, thus becoming the number one contender. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Also connected to the storyline was the allegiance of former Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance member Tomko to either Cage or Angle. Heading up to the match, Tomko explained he was not on either's side, despite being one-half of the TNA World Tag Team Champions with Styles. On the January 31, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko defeated Angle after interference from Cage. This resulted in Tomko and Cage seeming to be on the same page on the February 7, 2008 episode of Impact!. The main storyline in TNA's X Division revolved around Team 3D's (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) attempt to eliminate the X Division. This feud began on the October 18, 2007 episode of Impact! when Team 3D attacked The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin; MCMG) and proclaimed they were going to eliminate the X Division. MCMG went on to defeat Team 3D at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November 11, 2007. At the same event, Team 3D attacked and stole the TNA X Division Championship from then-champion Jay Lethal. On the November 15, 2007 episode of Impact!, Johnny Devine turned on the X Division and joined Team 3D in their quest. Team 3D and Devine went on to defeat Lethal and MCMG in a Six Man Tag Team Tables Match at TNA's Turning Point PPV event on December 2, 2007. The two teams then faced again at Final Resolution in a Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match, which Team 3D and Devine won. On the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, Devine and Team 3D challenged Lethal and MCMG to a Street Fight at Against All Odds, with the stipulation that if Team 3D won the X Division would disband, but if Lethal and MCMG won they would regain possession of the TNA X Division Championship and the X Division would continue to exist. On the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!, Lethal and MCMG accepted the agreement but only after including that Team 3D would have to weigh less than 275 pounds in order to compete in their matches in TNA. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Devine defeated Lethal to become the new TNA X Division Champion. The second-ever Barbed Wire Massacre was promoted for Against All Odds between Abyss and Judas Mesias. The feud for this match began in mid-2007 when Abyss' former manager Father James Mitchell returned and began a storyline with Abyss. Mesias made his debut on the September 13, 2007 episode of Impact! attacking Abyss at the request of Mitchell. After months of inactivity, Mesias returned on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact! attacking Abyss. At Final Resolution, Mesias defeated Abyss with help from Mitchell. On the January 24 episode of Impact!, Mitchell finally announced his reasons for feuding with Abyss, that he was Abyss' father and Mesias was Abyss' half-brother in the narrative. TNA promoted a Barbed Wire Massacre match between Abyss and Mesias at Against All Odds sometime after this. At Final Resolution, the team of Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks fought the team of Booker T and Sharmell. The storyline behind this encounter involved Sharmell coming to the defense of Roode's manager Ms. Brooks, who Roode verbally abused on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact!. After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell in the face, resulting in a storyline fractured jaw which sidelined her from appearing for the promotion and upsetting her real-life husband Booker T. Following the event, Roode fired Brooks and higher her replacement Payton Banks on the January 10 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Against All Odds. TNA promoted a match between Booker T and Robert Roode heading into Against All Odds. Two matches taking place at Against All Odds revolved around the Feast or Fired cases won at Turning Point by B.G. James, Petey Williams, and Scott Steiner. On the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact!, James was revealed to hold a future TNA World Tag Team Championship match with a partner of his choice, Williams' case was shown to hold a future TNA World Heavyweight Championship match, and Steiner's case held a future TNA X Division Championship match. During the segment, Steiner switched his case with Williams prior to the contents being revealed. This created a storyline between the two leading up to the January 31, 2008 episode of Impact! when Steiner teamed with Williams to face The Rock 'n Rave Infection (Jimmy Rave and Lance Hoyt). During the contest, Steiner stole Williams' case, bashed Williams with it, and left the arena. On the February 7, 2008 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Steiner and Williams would face at Against All Odds in which the winner would gain both cases. In the weeks following the December 13 episode, B.G.'s Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner Kip James inquired on when B.G. would announce his tag team partner. Finally, on the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!, B.G. announced his choice was his real- life father Bob Armstrong. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, B.G. and Armstrong announced they would use their title shot at Against All Odds. TNA later promoted A.J. Styles and Tomko versus B.G. James and Bob Armstrong for the TNA World Tag Team Championship for the event. Event Two matches were held prior to the event. The first was a tag team match pitting Jackie Moore and newly named Traci Brooks against WTPT disjockeys The Rise Guys (Skip and Mattman), which Moore and Brooks won when Moore gained the pinfall. The second was also a tag team match, in which the team of Sonjay Dutt and Consequences Creed defeated The Rock 'n Rave Infection (Jimmy Rave and Lance Hoyt) after Creed gained the fall on Rave. =Miscellaneous= The event featured employees other than the wrestlers involved in the matches. Mike Tenay and Don West were the commentators for the telecast. Jeremy Borash and David Penzer were ring announcers for the event. Andrew Thomas, Earl Hebner, Rudy Charles, and Mark \\"Slick\\" Johnson participated as referees for the encounters.

Afterwards, Saeed stood on the ring apron to distract ODB, allowing Kong to perform her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver and gain the pinfall to retain the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. =Main event matches= alt=Adult black male wearing white sunglasses and a white and blue jacket. The second-ever Barbed Wire Massacre was the sixth match on the card between Abyss and Judas Mesias, who was accompanied by Father James Mitchell. Its duration was fourteen minutes and fifty-one seconds. It was featured from the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida, because the city of Greenville, SC refused to allow a match that violent to take place live. In Barbed Wire Massacre, the ring ropes are switched with strands of barbed-wire and several weapons are featured wrapped in barbed-wire. The match falls under no disqualifications rules and is won by either a pinfall or submission. Mesias bashed Abyss over the head with a barbed-wire wrapped chair, which caused Abyss to bleed from the forehead. Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mitchell after he interfered in the bout. Abyss won the contest after using the Black Hole Slam to drop Mesias onto a barbed-wire wrapped board. The next match pitted Booker T against Robert Roode, who was accompanied by Payton Banks, in a bout lasting nine minutes and seventeen seconds. Near the end, Booker T began to bash Roode's leg against the ringpost. Afterwards, Roode began walking to the backstage area as Booker T followed continuing the fight as the referee counted out both men, ending the contest in a draw.

A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood on the top of a padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.
