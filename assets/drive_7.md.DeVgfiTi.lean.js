Sometimes known as the GTL, GT/L or just Lusso, it is larger and more luxuriousLusso means \\"luxury\\" in Italian. than the 250 GT Berlinetta. The 250 GT Lusso, which was not intended to compete in sports car racing, is considered to be one of the most elegant Ferraris. B. Laban, Ferrarissime, 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso, p.77 Keeping in line with the Ferrari \\"tradition\\" of that time, the 250 GT Lusso was designed by the Turinese coachbuilder Pininfarina, and bodied by Carrozzeria Scaglietti. Although the interior was more spacious than that of the 250 GT, the 250 GT Lusso remained a two-seat GT coupe, unlike the 250 GTE. The car was manufactured for only eighteen months, from 1962 to mid 1964, and was the last model of Ferrari 250 GT generation. Auto shows often provide an opportunity for manufacturers to introduce new designs publicly. Ferrari did so at the 1962 Paris Motor Show to unveil, as a prototype, the 250 GT Lusso. The prototype was almost identical to the production version, and only minor details changed thereafter. The new model was a way for Ferrari to fill a void left between the sporty 250 GT SWB and the luxurious 250 GTE 2+2,The 1950s were marked by the rapid evolution of road infrastructure, inducing increased demand for the faster and more balanced automobiles known as Grand Touring. Seating just two in the front and two in the rear, thus 2+2. the Lusso met the new demands of the 1960s. Indeed, fans of sporting driving of the time became as fond of civilized designs, that is, comfortable and spacious, as they were of radical sports cars. Ferrari did not skimp on details in the GTL, which shows on the scales; weight ranged from , depending on equipment.B. Laban, Ferrarissime, 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso, p.78 Unusually brief for a Ferrari model, GTL's production began in 1962 and ended August 1964. According to a longstanding American expert on Ferrari, Peter Coltrin, the construction of the 250 GT Lusso must have begun soon after the presentation of the prototype of the Paris Motor Show. Although it was not intended to compete, the 250 GT Lusso made a few appearances in several sporting events in 1964 and 1965, such as the Targa Florio and the Tour de France. The final iteration of the 250 GT series, 351 copies of GT Lusso were produced before being replaced by the Ferrari 275 GTB. (Note nomenclature change due to increase in engine cylinder capacity.) Originally sold for $13,375, the GTL saw sales in 2010 between $400,000 and $500,000, and in 2013 values approached 4 times this figure. External appearance The rear window provides good visibility Using certain aesthetic and aerodynamic features of the 250 GT and 250 GTO, Pininfarina led the design of the 250 GT Lusso,The 250 GT Lusso is also the first Ferrari model to have a crest on its Pininfarina body, usually maintained thereafter by the Turin designer. regarded by many as one of the most beautiful Ferraris ever made; it attracted notable personalities of that time, such as Steve McQueen and Eric Clapton. As usual, the company Carrozzeria Scaglietti was responsible for the manufacturing of the body. The body was made of steel with the exception of the doors, boot lid, and bonnet, which were made of aluminum. The stern of the body featured a small integrated spoiler; the 250 GTL became the first Ferrari to incorporate such aerodynamic appendages, concluding with an abrupt Kammback rear.B. Laban, Ferrarissime, 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso, p.81 The short rear is also characterized by a bezel that slopes down to the \\"tail\\" of the car. The glazed surfaces, including the rear window and triangular quarter windows, provided good visibility.H. Lehbrink et al., Ferrari, 250 GT Lusso, p.142/ The 250 GTL came with four round headlights in the front with the exception of a few versions, like an early London show car s/n 4335GT, that was used by Battista Pininfarina himself, featuring two covered headlights and an elongated nose section, like on previous style Ferraris. Numerous details of the body are unique to the 250 GT Lusso, such as the rectangular air vent placed on the hood, curved wings, and chrome bumpers, which were mainly decorative and positioned vertically beneath the indicator lights. Interior The instrument panel of the 250 GT Lusso had an unusual design for its time. As a variation of the luxurious 250 GT, the 250 GT Lusso had a spacious interior, made possible by the forward position of the engine; this was an unusual design choice at the time for Ferrari, known for their sports cars which emphasized even front/rear weight distribution. As the car was only a two-seater, there was a fairly capacious boot space with a parcel shelf, covered in quilted leather. While 250 GT Lusso was a civilized sport car, it was nevertheless \\"recommended in preference to young and flexible passengers\\" due to the fixed-position seatbacks. Despite this, the pedals were adjustable to , as in the racing versions.B. Laban, Ferrarissime, 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso, p.80 The design of the instrument panel, covered with soft and black leather was unusual; the tachometer, with a red zone beginning at 8,000 rpm, and the speedometer were placed at the center slightly tilted towards the driver. Five additional gauges were positioned in front of the driver, behind the three-spoke Nardi steering wheel made of wood and aluminum, placed almost vertically.H. Lehbrink et al., Ferrari, 250 GT Lusso, p.142 Chassis, brakes and suspensions The 250 GT Lusso has a short wheelbase of . Contrary to the 250 GTE \\"2+2\\" which had a wheelbase of , the GT Lusso was built on a short wheelbase of , identical to that of the 250 GT Berlinetta. The chassis was adopted from the tubular structure of the 250 GTO, but with narrower tubes.H. Lehbrink et al., Ferrari, 250 GT Lusso, p.143 The chassis could, according to Brian Laban, author of Ferrarissime, \\"brilliantly support the comparison with that of competitors\\". At the level of suspensions, the 250 GT Lusso had double wishbones and coil springs at the front, while the rear suspension comprised a live axle, leaf springs, semi-elliptical concentric coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers. Braking was provided by four- wheel disc brakes with hydraulic control, placed behind the polished aluminum Borrani wire wheels with knock-off hubs, fitted with 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 tyres. Engine and transmission Engine compartment of 1963 Ferrari 250 GT/L Lusso The 250 GT/L Lusso used a Colombo-designed V12 engine with a displacement of . This engine developed an output of at 7,500 rpm and torque at 5,500 rpm. It was able attain a maximum speed of , thus becoming the fastest passenger car of that period, and required only 7 to 8 seconds to accelerate from . Certain components such as the valves and the crankshaft, were derived from the engine of the 250 GT SWB, while others, such as the pistons and the cylinder block, were derived from the 250 GTE. The engine was equally \\"civilized\\" as the interior, given that it was provided with just one overhead cam head through the cylinder bank, two chain driven valves per cylinder and three dual-barrel Weber 36 DCS carburetors, compared to the twin- cam heads and six carburetors used on high performance models. This V12 engine suffered major smoke emissions during high acceleration and vibrations around 3,700 rpm. This was the reason that Steve McQueen, angered by the smoke in spite of persistent engine repairs, sold his 250 GT/L in 1967.H. Lehbrink et al., Ferrari, 250 GT Lusso, p.146 The gearbox was also subject of complaints since it was too high geared. Heritage Being the last representative of the Ferrari 250 lineage, beginning in 1952 with the 250 S, the end of the production of the 250 GT Lusso in 1964 heralded the beginning of a new generation of Ferraris, increasingly luxurious and refined, such as the Ferrari 275 and 330. The Ferrari 250 GT Lusso also marked the conclusion of a marketing strategy of Enzo Ferrari, according to which \\"Ferrari racing cars were sold, for car racing lined with the traffic, so that it can make the race competitive\\".B. Laban, Ferrarissime, 250 GTE (250 GT 2+2), p.59 Thus, Ferrari became a fully functional car manufacturer that attracted important customers interested in funding its passion for motor racing.

The cartularies are called the G√≥tico and the Galicano from the type of script used in each. They are housed in the National Archives of Spain. The Cartularies of Valpuesta are a series of 12th-century Visigothic documents which, in turn, are copies of earlier documents, some of which date back to the 9th century. These cartularies contain an abundance of words of a developing Romance dialect and a copious list of place names in the Valley of Gaubea and the surrounding area. Probably no other codex of that period offers so many tokens of an incipient Romance language with similarities with modern Spanish. The scribes did not write in pure, erudite Latin, but rather in a more evolved, Romance-like Latin, to be better understood by the common people. The transcription took place during the formative period of the Kingdom of Castile, and it might reflect the early evolution of the Castilian dialect, although a written standard had yet to be established. Although the authenticity of some of the texts is disputed,Medieval copyists often took liberties with the text of cartularies in order to enhance the privileges of their monasteries the cartularies are regarded as significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing the earliest words written in Spanish has been promoted by the Spanish Royal Academy and other institutions, even though the documents are meant to be written in Latin. They are written in a very late form of Latin mixed with other elements of a Hispanic Romance dialect that corresponds in some traits with modern Spanish. The preamble of the Statue of Autonomy of Castile and Le√≥n mentions the cartularies, along with the Nodicia de Kesos, as documents that contain the earliest traces of Spanish (las huellas m√°s primitivas del castellano). However, there have been other documents with a claim to being the earliest in Spanish, notably, the Glosas Emilianenses (marginalia of circa 1000 ce from La Rioja). In November of 2010, the Spanish Royal Academy endorsed the cartularies‚Äîwritten in \\"a Latin language assaulted by a living language\\" (\\"una lengua latina asaltada por una lengua viva\\")‚Äîas the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the Glosas Emilianenses. Publication Selections from the oldest documents were published in 1900 in the French journal Revue Hispanique. The cartularies are available in a recent scholarly edition.

(1) The carrying over of the final consonant of a word to the beginning of the following word. Examples in English include Middle English an evete becoming a newt and Middle English an eke-name becoming nickname. The term is obsolete in this sense; in modern terminology the process is usually called metanalysis or rebracketing, which also cover transposition in the reverse direction, as with Middle English a noumpere to Modern English an umpire. (2) In British Celtic languages, the devoicing of a consonant, specifically the change of voiced consonants to the corresponding voiceless consonants, e.g. of [g], [d], [b], [v] to [k], [t], [p], [f] respectively, under the influence of an adjacent voiceless consonant. Examples in Welsh include [g] > [k], as with teg \\"fair\\", which before a superlative suffix with the earlier form -haf (with voiceless [h]), gives tecaf \\"fairest\\". This term is also used for a grammatically triggered process with a similar effect as in, for example, Breton bro \\"land\\" but ho pro \\"your (plural) land\\". The term provection has also been used for a variety of other processes in Celtic with similar effects, such as when two successive voiced plosives were replaced by a single voiceless plosive (Welsh *meid-din from Latin matutinum \\"morning\\" becoming Welsh (ers) meitin \\"a while ago\\"), or when a voiced plosive was devoiced before a voiceless one and merged with it (Welsh pob \\"every\\" + peth \\"thing\\" becoming popeth \\"everything\\"). A further process for which the term has been used is for the change of a voiced fricative to a voiced stop after a resonant consonant, as in the case of Proto-Welsh *ben√∞ixt from Latin benedictio \\"blessing\\" becoming Welsh bendith. A catalogue of such effects is given in the historical linguistic text A Welsh grammar by J. Morris JonesJ. Morris Jones, A Welsh grammar. Oxford University Press (1912), pp. 81‚Äì88., and in A concise comparative Celtic grammar by H. Lewis and H. PedersenH. Lewis and H. Pedersen, A concise comparative Celtic grammar. G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht (1961, revised edition), pp. 123‚Äì127.. (For a brief account see also Ball (1993: 309)M.J. Ball, with J. Fife, eds, The Celtic languages. London: Routledge (1993), pp. 308‚Äì309 and 359.). The term is used by linguists both for the historical processes which give rise to a change of pronunciation, and for their legacy, the processes which occur when words or morphemes of the appropriate form are brought together in continuous speech or writing. In the earlier history of the Goidelic languages, some changes of pronunciation comparable to those in British Celtic occurred, and the term is also used to label them, but those processes have no counterparts in the grammars of the surviving modern Goidelic languages, Irish and Scottish Gaelic.

The house was owned for 400 years by the Roberts (and Crompton-Roberts) family, who took an active interest in supporting the people and organisations in the town.Kissack K (2003), Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, , p.60 It has reception rooms with fine plasterwork ceilings, woodcarvings, and specially commissioned grisaille roundels of the Arthurian Legend in the bay windows.\\"From Featherbeds to Bridges\\": The story of Drybridge House and the Crompton-Roberts family, page 44 The 1867 porch masks a 1671 datestone beneath its pediment.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, 2000, , p.402 The current house's magnificent interiors still contain items from William Roberts' building, such as the studded door of the tea room, parts of the oak panelling and staircase, and some of the carved fireplaces and Delft-tiled surrounds. Portraits of Charles Crompton-Roberts and his wife Mary can be found in the gallery. Charles Crompton-Roberts was interested in horticulture and sport and designed a parkland garden with an exceptional collection of trees and a cricket pitch, upon which W. G. Grace and his brother played in a team against a Monmouthshire side. The pitch has now gone but many of the trees still survive. The family also added many carvings to the exterior walls, including portraits of their three eldest children, Henry Roger, Violet Mary and Charles Montagu. A frequent visitor to the house at that time was the composer Edward Elgar, who conducted and composed for local musical organisations, and gave violin and piano lessons. One of his pupils was Alice Roberts, a cousin of the family, whom he later married. Drybridge House eventually passed to Richard Crompton Roberts, who was killed in action during the retreat from Dunkirk in 1940, and then to his sister Mary. After she married John Callender, she sold the house in 1947 to Monmouthshire County Council, with the caveat that it be used for the benefit of local people. It was then used as a welfare home for the elderly, and an extension was built in 1951. However, the home was closed suddenly in 1989, and - apart from a few months as a temporary police station - was left empty and deteriorating, despite its designation in 1991 as a Grade II* listed building and local protests against its abandonment. In 1998 the Bridges charity, based at the time in another building in Monmouth, won an agreement to develop Drybridge House as a community centre, and major fundraising began. With further grants, and the assistance of Cadw and the Heritage Lottery Fund, work took place on the refurbishment and restoration of the building, much of it involving volunteers from the local community. All the rooms were eventually opened for public use by the end of 2003. Current uses Drybridge House, also known as the Bridges Centre, is the only venue in Monmouth licensed for weddings, Drybridge House and is a meeting place for many local organizations. It also houses a centre for elderly people, nurseries and fitness groups, and alternative therapy practitioners. Drybridge Street Between the house and the medieval Monnow Bridge, along Drybridge Street is The Three Horseshoes Inn and 15th-century half-timbered houses which were restored at the end of the 19th century, in part using large wooden wallpaper blocks (formerly used for hand printing) fixed between the timber framing panels at first-floor level. These blocks were provided by Crompton-Roberts, who owned a printing business.

At the beginning of the 20th century, he incorporated elements of western painting to portray the great changes in Chinese culture. His work reflects his concern over the cruel realities of life and people's sorrows and differs from the work of artists who showed an indifference towards social reality. Early life Jiang was born at Lu county in Sichuan in 1904.McCloskey, Barbara. Artists of World War II London: Greenwood Press, 2005, , page 9. Jiang Zhaohe's great-grandfather and the whole family had moved into Lu county of Sichuan from Ma Cheng. He was the only boy born to his generation in the family so he was the hope of the whole family. The other children in his generation were all girls. Because his generation name was Wan (‰∏á), his father named him Jiang Wansui (Ëíã‰∏áÁª•). He lost his parents when he was 13 years old and afterward he also looked after his little sisters. Career He was a designer and painter in his early career, however, he became an artist who combined Chinese brush and ink painting with western painting using shading (chiaroscuro) rather than traditional line in his portraits and figure studies. He had no formal art education. In 1929, he exhibited in the National Art Exhibition in Nanjing.McCloskey, Barbara, page 9. He taught at the Central Academy of the Fine Arts.McCloskey, Barbara, page 9. He was elected as the member of the Chinese Artists Association. He was also elected as the consultant and member of China Federation of Literature together with the Institute of Chinese Painting Fellows.  Works  Jiang created a number of famous works, including \\"Good Friend \\" (ËâØÂèã), \\"Victims\\" (Áâ∫Áâ≤ËÄÖ), \\"Cai Ting\\" (Ëî°Âª∑), and \\"Girl\\" (ÂßëÂ®ò). His work, \\"Du Fu\\", gained the Reputation Reward. His most famous and influential work, however, is \\"Refugees\\" (ÊµÅ‰∫°Âõæ, Liuwang Tu). His works describe the real lives of poor people and the cruelty of society. They shocked society at the difficult time of the Japanese occupation and used a realistic style to portray that dark, hard time. His works are collected in the Painting Collection of Jiang Zhaohe and the National Art Museum of China He also published books on painting skills and methods of teaching painting. For example, \\"Problems in Teaching Chinese Figure Painting\\" („ÄäÂõΩÁîª‰∫∫Áâ©ÂÜôÁîüÁöÑÊïôÂ≠¶ÈóÆÈ¢ò„Äã), \\" On Drawing Education in Chinese Painting\\" („ÄäÂÖ≥‰∫é‰∏≠ÂõΩÁîªÁöÑÁ¥†ÊèèÊïôÂ≠¶„Äã), and \\"The Rules of Chinese Ink Figure Painting\\" („Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩÊ∞¥Â¢®‰∫∫Áâ©ÁîªÁöÑÈÄ†ÂûãËßÑÂæã„Äã), and others. Jiang Jiaohe was one of the most important painters in the introduction of chiaroscuro and western style figure and portraiture to Chinese brush and ink painting. His shared with Xu Beihong a firm commitment to realism and a social consciousness that found powerful expression in his art.  Notes  In 1925 Jiang created his first painting \\"ÈªÑÂåÖËΩ¶Â§´ÁöÑÂÆ∂Â∫≠\\". In the Autumn of 1927 he met Xu Beihong in a friend's home and they established a long lasting friendship. In 1928 he was appointed by Li Yi to teach design at the Education School of Nanjing Central University. In 1930 Jiang transferred to Shanghai Art School as the Drawing Professor. In 1937 he held an exhibition of his latest works in Beiping. In 1943 he exhibited his great scroll painting Refugees (Liuwang Tu), but the exhibition was closed down the next day by Japanese occupation forces. In 1947 Xu Beihong appointed him Professor in the Beiping Art School. In 1950, he was appointed as a Professor in the Central Academy of Fine Art.

Interagency Archeological Services Division A reservoir was deemed necessary to assist in kaolin processing during times of drought. For this project to commence, a permit was needed from the Corps of Engineers, which required a cultural resource impact study to first be done. J.M. Huber Corporation contracted Southeastern Archaeological Services to do an initial survey of the area in 1988 with additional data recovery in 1990. J.M Huber Corporation determined that two sites surveyed by Southeastern Archaeological Services, specifically 9WR4 and 9WR11, could not be avoided or preserved. Huber no longer owns this property. These two sites were excavated between April 23 and May 31, 1990. The field report, Archaeological Investigations at Mill Branch Sites 9WR4 and 9WR11 Warren County, Georgia, was published in 1995 and compiled by R. Jerald Ledbetter. 9WR4 Site 9WR4 was located on the west bank of Brier Creek with the northern boundary set by Little Brier Creek. The site measured about 1.20 hectares in size. 9WR4 was divided into northern, southern, and southeastern areas due to topography. This site was excavated in all three sections using heavy machinery in conjunction with manual spadework. A smooth bucket backhoe was used to excavate a total of eighteen trenches as well as a 20 m x 20 m block and a 25 m x 25 m block. The trenches were then cleaned and smoothed by hand trowel. Artifacts emphasizing the Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Early Woodland, and Middle Woodland periods were identified. Five types of features were found throughout 9WR4: unlined midden pits, rock lined midden pits, rock clusters, post molds, and an early dwelling. Pit House A feature described as \\"the single most important discovery on 9WR4\\" was found in the southern section. This feature was a Late Archaic midden filled pit house. Charcoal found in the hearth was radiocarbon dated to 1900-1950 B.C. The distribution of artifacts suggested that the artifacts were accumulated over time, and not used as fill after abandonment of the dwelling. This large rectangular feature measured about 5m x 4m x 35 cm and had a volume of about 5650 liters. There was no evidence of multiple structures present at one time. 9WR11 Site 9WR11 was located to the south of 9WR4 and just across Mill Branch which forms the northern border of the site. The site measured to about 1.20 hectares making this site about the same size as 9WR4, but due to a mature hardwood presence, fewer blocks were excavated. This site was surveyed using a systematic series of shovel tests, and then heavy machinery was used to clear four trenches to a maximum depth of 40 cm except for Trench 1 which was dug to a maximum of 1.2 m. A smooth backhoe was used to create the trenches, and they were all 3 m wide and ranged in length from 9 m - 22.5 m. Trench 3 was expanded into an excavation block. 9WR11 was a Late Archaic primary lithic workshop site. The majority of the artifacts found were lithic. Some pottery was found from later periods suggesting that the site may have been used as a secondary workshop in later periods.

The Portuguese nobility was a social class enshrined in the laws of the Kingdom of Portugal with specific privileges, prerogatives, obligations and regulations. The nobility ranked immediately after royalty and was itself subdivided into a number of subcategories which included the titled nobility and nobility of blood at the top and civic nobility at the bottom, encompassing a small, but not insignificant proportion of Portugal's citizenry. The nobility was an open, regulated social class. Accession to it was dependent on a family's or, more rarely, an individual's merit and proven loyalty to the Crown in most cases over generations. Formal access was granted by the Monarch through letters of ennoblement and a family's status within the noble class was determined by continued and significant services to Crown and country. Living outside the laws of the nobility immediately revoked an individual's status and that of his descendants. Unlike many other European countries, power in Portugal was effectively centralised in the Crown, despite attempts to the contrary by the nobility, most notably during the reign of King Jo√£o II, as was the capacity to confer nobility and other awards as well as to refuse them. During the Portuguese monarchy, as well as enjoying the most privileged status and access to Court, members of the nobility, particularly the titled nobility, including major hierarchs of the Roman Catholic Church, held the most important offices of State - administrative, judicial, political and military. With the needs of an ever larger global empire and the rise of mercantilism, and growth in importance of the mercantile class, privileges were increasingly widened, eroding the relative power held particularly by the titled nobility, a situation which was accelerated significantly during the reign of King Jos√© I, as a result of the policies of his prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, himself recently elevated to the highest echelons of the nobility. With the Portuguese Constitution of 1822 and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy, all noble privileges were extinguished, and the influence of the traditional nobility declined significantly. Notwithstanding, nobility - hereditary or otherwise - continued to be recognised in law as a status with certain prerogatives, albeit merely honorific ones, until the establishment of the Portuguese Republic in 1910. Descendants of Portugal's hereditary nobles have continued to bear their families' titles and coats of arms according to the standards and regulations established before the Republic, and currently sustained by the Institute of Portuguese Nobility (Instituto da Nobreza Portuguesa), whose honorary president is D. Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, head of the House of Braganza and presumptive heir to the Portuguese throne. History The Portuguese nobility can be traced back to the reign of Alfonso VI of Leon, whose reign saw the sons of Leonese nobility established as gentry in the north of Portugal, between the Minho River and the Douro River. This was the region of the sun and the most powerful men of the kingdom. They united nobility of birth to the authority and prestige of public office. They were followed in the hierarchy, in descending order, by infancies, cavaleiros (knights) and escudeiros (squires). A title of Spanish origin, filho de algu√©m, applied to senior functionaries and gave rise to the word fidalgo, who, in the 14th century, became widespread and went on to name all of noble lineage, thereby designating the highest class of the nobility, without distinction of rank. Renaissance Vasco da Gama was granted the title of Count of Vidigueira after his discovery of the sea route to India. By the time of the reign of Manuel I of Portugal (1495-1521), during the Portuguese Renaissance, for example, when they were appointed captains of the fleet of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, who arrived in Brazil on April 22, 1500, the Portuguese nobility already had registers dating back to the 12th century. The noble members of Cabral's fleet followed this feature, since most descended from families of Castile and Le√≥n, who had settled in Portugal, who had already rendered several generations of service. The few exceptions - such as Bartolomeu Dias, who received his rank and arms which he transmitted to his descendants - show the importance attributed at this period to the discoveries made. It was also the reign of King Manuel I that rules were established that define the use of the degrees of nobility (hereditary titles), and the use of heraldic arms, preventing abuses in the adoption of both and establishing the rights of the nobility. The nobles were subject to the king and were arranged in two orders, each with three degrees: *First Order **1st grade: Fidalgo Cavaleiro **2nd grade: Fidalgo Escudeiro **3rd grade: Mo√ßo Fidalgo **4th grade: Fidalgo Capel√£o (for ecclesiastics) *Second Order **1st grade: Cavaleiro Fidalgo **2nd grade: Escudeiro Fidalgo **3rd grade: Mo√ßo da C√¢mara **4th grade: Capel√£o Fidalgo (for ecclesiastics) All nobles were considered vassals of the King of Portugal. To rise in status, a noble was expected to demonstrate loyalty and service to the king. The battle of Alc√°cer Quibir in 1578 was an unmitigated disaster for Portugal. King Sebastian of Portugal died on the battlefield along with most of the Portuguese nobility, leading to the end of the Aviz dynasty. Though the 15th and 16th centuries were rich in acts of bravery and heroic deeds, the deeds related to the Age of Discoveries were not represented symbolically for new arms in Portuguese blazon. Few were granted, and not all heraldic grants were recorded. This did not occur with those involved in combat, especially during the occupation of northern Africa, which feature many coats of arms with their own attributes, such as \\"Moorish head.\\" The heraldry of the Discoveries is restricted to inherited symbols from the family, or canting arms, such as Nuno Leitao da Cunha, with nine wedges (cunhas), or the goats of Cabral, without suggesting or representing the challenges found in the sea and its conquest. The arms of Nicolau Coelho, which contain a base undy silver and blue, which can symbolize the conquered sea, is a rare exception. Modern era Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, one of the most powerful nobles in Portuguese history. In the first half of the 18th century, the Royal Equestrian Academy (today known as the Portuguese School of Equestrian Art) was founded by King Jo√£o V of Portugal as a riding school exclusively accessible to the Portuguese Royal Family and the nobility. Good horsemanship was and still is considered a hallmark of the Portuguese nobility, equestrianism continuing to this day to be the traditional sport of the class. Following the Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic in 1910, the nobility was officially disbanded and ennoblement was prohibited under the Portuguese Constitution. Notwithstanding, although the status of nobility has not been recognised in law since 1910, legitimate titles of nobility (those granted by a reigning monarch before the 5th October 1910) have been given legal recognition and protection, including under article 26 of the Portuguese Constitution, in conjunction with articles 70 and 72 of the Civil Code, as established by decision of Portugal's Supreme Court of Justice in 2014. Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza, created the Portuguese Council of Nobility during the Republic to study the former monarchy's laws and grants of nobility, and to update the genealogies of ennobled families, maintaining records on the transmission of hereditary titles in accordance therewith. The predominant activity of the Council was the identification of living heirs to historical titles and coats of arms. After Dom Duarte Nuno's death, his son Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, declared the Council of Nobility disbanded, following criticism in relation to a handful of questionable decisions. Subsequently, the Instituto da Nobreza Portuguesa was established by representatives of Portugal's titled nobility, with the acquiescence and support of the Duke fo Braganza - its honorary president - as a self-regulating private body which continues the work and maintains the records of the original Council of Nobility. Hierarchy of the Nobility Ant√≥nio Jos√© de √Åvila, 1st Duke of √Åvila and Bolama, the only commoner to become a duke. The ranks of the titled nobility, although similar to those in other European countries, have their idiosyncrasies in Portugal. They are as follows: #Royal Dukedoms #Dukedoms #Marquisates #Countships #Viscountcies with honours of Grandeza #Viscountcies #Baronies #Lordships (abolished by the Charter of 19 May 1863) The holders of all titles of Count, Marquis and Duke were automatically imbued with Grandeza of the kingdom of Portugal. The rank of Grandeza was automatic also for Bishops, Archbishops, Cardinals and the Patriarch of Lisbon, as well as for Peers of the Realm during the constitutional monarchy when the House of Peers was established in the Portuguese Cortes. In addition, in rare circumstances, viscountcies were given the attribute of \\"Honras de Grandeza\\", placing them on a rank equivalent to countships. This is the case with the viscountcies of Asseca and Balsem√£o, for example. In extraordinary circumstances, certain titleholders were granted the hereditary title of \\"Parente d'El Rei\\". As well as denoting a historic blood relationship with the Crown, it was a sign of exceptional merit and raised the titleholder's status above that of all other titled nobility, with the exception of royal dukes. Examples include the dukes of Cadaval, marquesses of Lavradio and Valen√ßa, and counts of √ìbidos. All nobles titles were effectively hereditary but most required new concessions for their respective heirs. In rare occasions, these were given to members of the same family that were not the immediate heir. Titles were granted: * De juro e herdade: in perpetuity, according to the law, where to be inherited a title required no further concession from the Crown or the State, but merely its acknowledgement. * Em vida: limited to 1, 2, 3 or 4 holders, as specified by the grant, thereafter requiring a specific concession from the Crown to be inherited or renewed. In Portugal and Brazil, the honorific Dom () is often used for men who belong to the House of Braganza. Otherwise, in Portugal, it is used by members of families of some of its titled nobility. Unless ennobling letters patent specifically authorised its use, Dom was not attributed to members of Portugal's untitled nobility: Since hereditary titles in Portugal descended according to primogeniture, the right to the style of Dom was the only apparent distinction between cadets of titled families and members of untitled noble families. Fidalgos constituted the lowest rank of nobility of blood. King Manuel I was Duke of Beja prior to ascending to the Portuguese throne. Royally-held noble titles In addition to their royal titles, members of Portugal's royal family have held a number of noble titles, either through acquisition prior to the family's accession to the throne or by grant of the monarch. Following the proclamation of the republic in 1910, these titles have been used by various members of the royal family, notably by the Duke of Braganza's younger brothers and by his three children. The following are titles that have been held at various times by Portuguese royalty: =Titles held by the monarch= *Lord of Ceuta *Lord of Alc√°cer in Africa *Lord of Guinea =Titles held by the heir to the Portuguese throne= Duke of Braganza has been a title used by the heir to the Portuguese throne since 1640 (pictured Jos√©, Prince of Brazil & Duke of Braganza). * Duke of Braganza * Duke of Guimar√£es * Marquis of Vila Vi√ßosa * Count of Guimar√£es * Count of Arraiolos * Count of Our√©m * Count of Neiva * Count of Faria =Titles held by the heir to the royal heir= * Duke of Barcelos * Count of Barcelos =Titles held by the monarch's children= *Duke of Porto Title held by the reigning monarch's 2nd child *Duke of Beja Title held by the reigning monarch's 3rd child =Other titles bestowed on royalty= * Duke of Viseu * Duke of Coimbra * Duke of Guarda See also *List of titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown *Kingdom of Portugal *Portuguese empire *Nobility Sources *Titles of Portuguese nobility (In Portuguese) *Royal dukedoms of Portugal (In Portuguese) *Dukedoms of Portugal (In Portuguese) *Titles held by the heir to the throne of Portugal (In Portuguese) *Titles held by the heir to the heir of the throne of Portugal (In Portuguese) References and notes Category:Portuguese monarchy Category:Princes of Portugal Category:Kingdom of Portugal ","title":"Portuguese nobility"},{"id":"33951002","text":"Joseph Taylor (died 19 November 1859, Bombay), was a London Missionary Society missionary in Gujarat.The Missionary magazine and chronicle: Volumes 24-25 - Page 63 London Missionary Society - 1860 The following particulars of the last illness and death of Mr. Taylor are taken from the \\"Bombay Guardian :\\" ‚Äî \\" On Saturday, the 19th inst.

The label was founded in 1995, and is run by Kees de Koning and Vincent Patty. After some commercial success (with rap acts such as De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig, The Opposites, Def Rhymz, Postmen, and Extince) it became allied with Virgin EMI Records, and since 2004 has a marketing and distribution deal with PIAS Entertainment Group. It has expanded into Dutch-language music by singer- songwriters such as Lucky Fonz III, and in 2009 signed a distribution and marketing agreement with Universal Music Group. Still praised in 2009 as \\"the brand for high-quality Dutch hip-hop\\", it sought to expand into other musical genres. History Founder Kees de Koning is a former music journalist and manager of Anouk. He is credited with \\"putting Dutch hip-hop on the map\\" with TopNotch, signing acts such as De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig, Extince, and The Opposites. Initially the label, which released music that didn't automatically receive radio play, used platforms such as YouTube and Hyves to get attention for its artists, and added Instagram and Vine. TopNotch also collaborates in marketing with companies such as the brewery Bavaria and insurance company Centraal Beheer; for the latter, it made a video featuring Anouk, watched over 2 million times by August 2013. After achieving commercial success with Def Rhymz, Postmen, and Extince, the label acquired a reputation such that Virgin EMI Records hired de Koning as A&R; and label manager in 2000. Success with Raymzter and Opgezwolle notwithstanding, de Koning's contract was not renewed after four years, and the label was in danger of folding. In 2004, PIAS Entertainment Group signed a distribution and marketing deal with TopNotch, saving the label. The first releases after the restructuring were by VSOP, Duvel Duvel, and Kubus. In 2009, the label make a distribution and marketing agreement with Universal Music Group (owners of Virgin EMI) and signed a non- hip-hop act, gabber punk band Aux Raus. Their fifteenth anniversary, in 2010, was celebrated with a two-day festival in the Melkweg. That same year the label signed Lucky Fonz III, a Dutch-language singer, in a more comprehensive effort to expand beyond hip-hop which also included signing Surinamese singer Damaru; de Koning had personally pursued the artist, whose monthly performances in the TV show De Wereld Draait Door he admired. Their biggest commercial success to date is Gers Pardoel, whose \\"Ik neem je mee\\" is referred to as the most successful Dutch song ever; the song's video had 15 million views by 15 August 2013, a Dutch record. De Koning started another company in 2006, Good Life, with Jerry Leembruggen and Ruben Fernhout (founders of The Partysquad and owners of the production company F & L Entertainment). Good Life aimed to produce more pop-oriented, rhythm and blues artists (such as Wudstik) through record deals and events. In 2012, NopTotch started also signing Flemish rappers, the first Flemish rappers who signed were Safi & Spreej. 1 year later, Tourist LeMC also signed in TopNotch short after winning Humo's Rock Rally. Signing these 2 Flemish rappers was the first step to help Flanders grow the Flemish hip-hop culture.

All of these competitions are non-competitive and all are pay to enter, so only products that have paid an entrance fee will be judged.

Major rating organizations There are numerous liquor, spirits, beer and wine competitions. SIP Awards The SIP (Spirit International Prestige) Awards, based in Newport Beach, California, was founded in 2009. They use a panel of consumer judges to elect the top winners. In 2019, SIP Awards had a record highs of 977 entrants and 146 consumer judges. The competition is open to any commercial spirit or applicable mixers professionally produced that comply with their classification codes. Beverage Testing Institute The Beverage Testing Institute is based in Chicago, US, and founded in 1981 with its initial focus on wine but later branching into spirits and beer. They use a dedicated tasting laboratory in order to create consistent results and minimize external distractions. Each periodic tasting is conducted at the same time of day under identical conditions. The panelists are selected from the professional world of restaurants and publications under the leadership of director Jerald O'Kennard. Not all spirits are given a rating. Those of sufficient merit are awarded a point score between 80 and 100. * 80‚Äì84: Recommended * 85‚Äì89: Highly Recommended * 90‚Äì95: Exceptional * 96‚Äì100: Superlative The institute seeks to produce \\"fair and impartial wine reviews for consumers\\". Buying guides have appeared in All About Beer, Epicurious.com, International Wine Review, Wine Enthusiast, Restaurant Hospitality, The New Yorker Magazine, Wine & Spirits, etc.  International Whisky Competition  The International Whisky Competition rates whiskies from around the world based on quality. These are blind tasted and rated by a professional tasting panel using 15 different criteria. These criteria produce tasting notes along with aroma and flavor profiles. Since 2015, it uses a 100-point scoring system designed by Sebastien Gavillet, an adaptation from the wine industry rating system. New York International Spirits Competition Founded by Adam Levy. San Francisco World Spirits Competition Founded in 2000 by Anthony Dias Blue. Blue is the current director of both the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and the San Francisco International Wine Competition. It assesses hundreds of entrants annually (1407 in 2013 from 63 countries) with \\"blind\\" tastings involving panels of expert judges selected each year from the spirits industry including mixologists, spirits buyers, and media from across the United States. Producers must submit their product for the competition and pay a fee ($475 for 2013) for its evaluation. Not all entries are given awards (those not judged of sufficient quality are not given an award) but most receive a bronze, silver, or gold award from the tasting panel. The fact that most entrants receive an award likely involves some degree of self-selection, as the spirits producers choose whether to enter each of their brands in the competition and pay to receive a rating. Those entrants that are given a unanimous gold medal by the panel are given the distinction of a \\"double-gold\\" medal. Additionally, a \\"best in show\\" designation is awarded in each main category of spirits. Wine Enthusiast Wine Enthusiast publishes a magazine and other media to promote the appreciation of both wines and spirits. It is headquartered in New York and founded in 1979. Currently, spirits reviews are provided by F. Paul Pacult, who does tastings in a controlled environment.

The satellites have been characterized as being the size of a large postage stamp. and also as \\"cracker size\\". The mission launch was originally scheduled for late 2013 and was launched April 18, 2014. Kicksat reached its orbit and transmitted beacon signals that were received by radio amateurs. Telemetry data allowed the prediction of the orbit and the reentry on May 15, 2014 at about 01:30 UTC. Due to a non-redundant design, a timer reset while on-orbit and the femtosatellites were not deployed in time, and burned up inside the KickSat mothership when the undeployed satellite-deployment mechanism reentered Earth's atmosphere. It is one of several crowdfunded satellites launched during the 2010s. History The project was crowdfunded through Kickstarter. The project was advertised with the goal of reducing the cost of spaceflight so that it could be affordable on an individual basis. Design In its minimal configuration, each Sprite femtosatellite will be designed to send a very short message (a few bytes long) to a network of ground stations. The chipset of use is a TI CC430F5137 (MCU + RF) with codebase from panStamp. Firmware developer kits were sent to donors who contributed enough to qualify for customizing their own Sprite. Sprites can be organized into fleets; one of them was to be named for the British Interplanetary Society. London Hackspace had begun work on its own ground station. Inaugural mission KickSat launched on an ISS commercial resupply mission, SpaceX CRS-3, originally scheduled for late 2013, but ultimately delayed until April 18, 2014. On April 30, 2014 the microcontroller managing the master clock was found to have reset due to a technical problem, an effect of space radiation. This reset added two weeks to the deployment schedule for the sprites, and started a race against time to charge KickSat's battery enough to power deployment of the sprites before KickSat began atmospheric reentry. On May 14, 2014 KickSat reentered the atmosphere and burned up; all sprites were lost. Other missions Sprites were launched on board the during STS-134 in May 2011, and spent three years mounted to the outside of the ISS as part of the eighth Materials International Space Station Experiment. Upon their return to Earth, they were still functional. This verified the design could survive the space environment for far longer than the planned nominal mission length. In 2016, the KickSat Sprite was discussed as an early-stage prototype of the interstellar probe proposed for Breakthrough Starshot. On June 23, 2017 the PSLV-C38 launch carried 31 satellites into low Earth orbit. Among them were Max Valier, built by OHB of (Germany) and Venta-1 which were carrying six sprite spacecraft as secondary payloads. After being shortlisted in February 2015 by NASA under its CubeSat Launch Initiative, KickSat-2 was launched aboard Cygnus NG-10 SS John Glenn on November 17, 2018. After detaching from the ISS, the free-flying Cygnus spacecraft deployed KickSat-2 at an altitude of 300 km on February 13, 2019. KickSat-2 established communication with ground controllers soon after, reporting good health despite a weaker than expected signal. On March 18, 2019 KickSat-2 deployed 105 Sprites which successfully transmitted data before reentering the atmosphere.

His younger brother, Jaime Velayo Ongpin, was Minister of Finance of the Philippines under President Cory Aquino. In the 2018 ranking by Forbes Magazine of the world's richest, Ongpin was named as the Philippines' twelfth wealthiest Filipino (up from sixteenth in 2017), with a net worth US$3.72 billion. Early life and education Roberto Velayo Ongpin was born on January 6, 1937. He is the second of seven children by Luis Roa Ongpin and Lourdes Morales Velayo. He grew up in the neighborhood of Pinaglabanan in San Juan, which was then a suburb of the City of Manila. Roberto Ongpin is the great grandson of Rom√°n T. Ongpin, a Filipino-Chinese businessman and philanthropist who aided Filipino revolutionaries against the Spanish and American colonial administration in the Philippine islands. The Ongpins have been named as among the \\"most influential and enduring families of the Philippines\\" for their contributions to the nation's growth. Ongpin was able to attend school through a scholarship. After graduating from Ateneo High School, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (cum laude) from the Ateneo de Manila University in 1957. He became a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in 1958, after which he briefly joined Procter & Gamble in Manila. In 1961, Ongpin earned his Masters of Business Administration from Harvard University. It was during his time in Harvard that he met and married his wife of 55 years, Monica Arellano of Valparaiso, Chile. They have three children together, Stephen Arellano Ongpin, Dahlea Arellano Ongpin and Anna Arellano Ongpin. He also has two other children from different mothers, Michelle Schroer Ongpin, and Julian Stone Ongpin. He has four grandchildren, Adlyna, Adeeb, Isaac, and Amyla. 1986 People Power Revolution In the early hours of February 22, 1986, as Roberto V. Ongpin was preparing to go to Malaca√±an Palace for a meeting with President Marcos, US Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, and Special Envoy Philip Habib, he noticed that his military escorts had been pulled out. Ongpin's subsequent calls to then- Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile inquiring about the whereabouts of his security detail inadvertently alerted Enrile that Marcos may have already been aware of his plans to stage a coup de'tat. This triggered Enrile's hasty break from the government, eventually leading to the People Power Revolution that installed Corazon C. Aquino as the new Philippine President. Business career Sycip Gorres Velayo After moving back to the Philippines in 1963, Roberto V. Ongpin was recruited by his maternal uncle, Fred Velayo to work for \\"the Philippines' largest multidisciplinary professional services firm,\\" Sycip Gorres Velayo & Company (SGV). According to SGV Chairman Emeritus Washington Sycip, Ongpin is \\"one of the most aggressive and effective managers\\" he has ever known. In 1966, two years after joining the firm, Ongpin - who was barely 30 years old at that time - was named a managing partner of SGV. He served the company from 1964 to 1979. Minister of Trade and Industry In 1979, Roberto V. Ongpin became the Philippines' youngest Trade and Industry Minister at age 42 when he accepted the invitation of former Philippine President, Ferdinand E. Marcos, Sr., to join his cabinet. During his seven-years as Minister, Ongpin grappled with the deteriorating economy as political instability made funding from international agencies and banks difficult for the government. On occasion, he personally had to negotiate financing for the Philippines with other world leaders, including Brunei‚Äôs Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. In 1984, with \\"the Philippines facing a debt and foreign exchange crisis, the black market exchange rate soared to Php 30 per Dollar (versus the official rate of Php 14 per Dollar).\\" Ongpin is credited with stabilizing the Philippine Peso by establishing the \\"Binondo Central Bank,\\" a dual exchange rate system that allowed the government to narrow the rate gap by directly intervening in black market currency prices. Belle Corp/Tagaytay Highlands After the fall of Marcos, Roberto V. Ongpin concentrated on growing his businesses. Among his first ventures Belle Corp. with former fellow Binondo Central Bank veteran, Benito Tan Guat. As chief executive officer, Ongpin was \\"undoubtedly recognized as the creator\\" of the Belle's flagship development, Tagaytay Highlands. He was also \\"instrumental in transforming the property into what it is today, one of the premier developments outside Metro Manila,\\" and \\"the single largest - and most successful - upscale resort community in the Philippines to date.\\" Atok-Big Wedge, Inc. Roberto V. Ongpin is the chairman of investment holding company Atok-Big Wedge, Inc. The company's primary purpose is general investment. The company's second purposes include mining, real estate, manufacturing, processing, lending and borrowing money. Alphaland Ongpin owns 94% of the shares of Alphaland, and is chairman of Alphaland Balesin Island Club, Inc., and the City Club at Alphaland Makati Place, Inc.; the developers of the Balesin Island Club, a \\"world-class, members-only resort that has been described as a 500-hectare paradise with 7.3 kilometers of pristine white sand beaches, located 21 kilometers southwest of Polillo, Quezon Province,\\" and the City Club, an Php 8 billion multi-use commercial residential complex that has three high-rise buildings, a shopping mall, and a \\"3-hectare leisure, entertainment and business club.\\" In 2015, Alphaland‚Äôs comprehensive net income rose 31% to P7.2 billion, from P5.5 billion in the previous year. In 2016 company profits rose 7.5% to Php 7.7 billion (from Php 7.2B in 2015). The company also owns and operates Alphaland Aviation, Inc.. It has a pending petition before the Philippines Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to be allowed \\"to be granted the authority to operate domestic air transportation services.\\" Alphaland Aviation currently provides exclusive charter services to Balesin Island Club located in Lamon Bay, Quezon province. In September 2017 Ongpin launched Alphaland Baguio Mountain Lodges, \\" a 78-hectare master-planned development of 300 lodge-style log homes\\" in Baguio City, Philippines.The project is being developed at a cost of P5 billion. PhilWeb Corporation (South Seas Oil and Mineral Exploration Co. Inc.) In 1979, Ongpin acquired control of South Seas Oil and Mineral Exploration Co. Inc. a mining and exploration company incorporated on August 20, 1969. On January 18, 2000, South Seas Natural Resources, Inc. became PhilWeb.Com, Inc., an internet company, upon the stockholders‚Äô approval of a restructuring plan which involved changes in the Company‚Äôs name, and primary purpose, among others. At the annual stockholders‚Äô meeting on May 31, 2002, the stockholders approved the change in corporate name from PhilWeb.com, Inc. to PhilWeb Corporation. The stockholders also approved the inclusion of the gaming business as an additional secondary purpose of the Company. The SEC approved these changes on November 5, 2002. In August 2016, Ongpin resigned his post as chairman of PhilWeb Corporation, after being tagged by President Rodrigo Duterte as being part of the oligarchy, which was followed by a subsequent order to halt the online gambling industry, which was the core business of Philweb. Ongpin later clarified that Philweb is \\"not an online gaming company,\\" but is merely the \\"software providers of e-Games, which is actually owned by (the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation).\\" The unexpected singling out of Ongpin by the President has puzzled many observers, with some speculating that he may have just been a victim of the Philippines' \\"murky\\" politics. Ongpin however stresses that he 'bears no rancor' towards Duterte. \\"He is my President, and I will do all I can to support him and his policies.\\" Ongpin's decision to sell his shares in PhilWeb to former president Marcos' son-in-law, Gregorio Araneta III, has led to a lessening of the political pressure on himself and the company, allowing him to focus on his other business interests. Local and International Business Affiliations Mr. Roberto V. Ongpin was also previously the Chairman by Philippine Bank of Communications, Inc., Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc., (2006-2011), Belle Corporation, La Flor dela Isabela (1996), Sinophil Corporation, RVO Capital Ventures Corporation, Tabacalera Incorporada, Connectivity Unlimited Resource Enterprise, Inc.

As was customary for Bavarian and Austrian monasteries, the Lambach Abbey offered rooms and meals for travellers and maintained a small chapel for both the liturgy and entertainment. This stopover is not mentioned in the correspondence of the Mozart family and is only known through the two manuscripts in the monastery. Neal Zaslaw: Symphony in G major, K. 45a (\\"Old Lambach\\"). Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: The Symphonies Vol VII. Recording of the Academy of Ancient Music , Jaap Schr√∂der concertmaster, Continuo: Christopher Hogwood. Decca Record, London 1988. Decca Record, London 1988 These two manuscripts were found at the beginning of the 20th century as copies (not autographs) in the archives of the Lambach Abbey and were probably gifts from the Mozart family as thanks for the hospitality given to them. Volker Scherliess: Die Sinfonien. In: Silke Leopold (editor): Mozart-Handbuch. B√§renreiter-Verlag, Kassel 2005, , . One (the \\"Old Lambach\\") had the title \\"Del Sigre: Wolfgango Mozart. Dono Authoris 4.ta Jan. [1]769\\" while the other (the \\"New Lambach\\", K. deest, Eisen G 16) was attributed to \\"Leopoldo\\" with the same date. Alfred Einstein assumed that the \\"Old Lambach\\" symphony (the one attributed to Wolfgang) was composed by 1767-68 during the stay in Vienna (which fit with the date on the manuscript in Lambach) and entered it into the main K√∂chel catalogue as K. 45a. This analysis was repeated in later editions of the K√∂chel catalogue. (The previous editions numbered the work as K. Anh. 221 as the work was then unknown apart from an incipit in the catalogue of Breitkopf & H√§rtel.) In 1964, Anna Amalie Abert published a new hypothesis that the title pages of the two Lambach symphonies were accidentally reversed. Her theory was based on an extensive examination of both works, as well as comparisons between these and other symphonies known to be composed by Leopold and Wolfgang at about the same time. As a result, Abert concluded that K. 45a is archaic in style and, from an aesthetic point, \\"less good\\" symphony of Leopold, who must have been the composer of the older, more conservative and less gifted K. 45a. Moreover, the comparison revealed similarities between formal and stylistic characteristics of the first movements of K. 45a and other symphonies by Leopold, and the first movements of \\"New Lambach\\" and other symphonies by Wolfgang. Furthermore, the fact that the first movement has only one theme and the large use of two-bar phrases making up sequencesSee the 1st movement, bars 8, 23 and 29. make it more likely to be written by Leopold, while the more continuous, spun and varied melodic ideas of the \\"New Lambach\\" symphony make it more likely to be written by Wolfgang. After this, the \\"New Lambach\\" symphony was subsequently published as a work of Mozart and was recorded as part of some complete recordings of Mozart's symphonies (most notably in The Complete Mozart Edition). Lambach Abbey However, Zaslaw argues that the original assignment was correct, for the following reasons: *The more continuous melodic ideas of the \\"New Lambach\\" symphony is a common feature of the late Baroque, whereas the two-bar phrases of the \\"Old Lambach\\" pointed more to the more modern (at the time) galant style. *The two manuscripts were copied by the Salzburg copyists Estlinger, implying that they must have been composed in Salzburg before the Mozarts left for Vienna in September 1767. However, the earlier the symphonies are dated, the more understandable Wolfgang's \\"archaic style\\" becomes. *On the Mozart family's travels, Wolfgang learnt a lot of musical styles, and later Wolfgang (rightly) claimed that he could compose in any style. *Ascribing the \\"Old Lambach\\" symphony to Leopold due to it being \\"less good\\" and \\"less gifted\\" underestimates Leopold's ability as a composer. *As the contemporary Mozart symphonies No. 6, No. 7 and No. 8 were all not composed in Vienna, it seems doubtful that this symphony was composed in Vienna. *It is unlikely that the pedantic Leopold would have accepted the Salzburg copyists' accidental interchanging of the title pages, used the symphony for concerts and finally donated the manuscripts to the Lambach Abbey (where a monk could have subsequently written the date \\"1769\\") without correcting the error at some point. *In 1767, Leopold copied six early symphonies of Wolfgang and sent them to Prince Wenzel in Donaueschingen. K. 45a was probably among these six. In February 1982, the original orchestral parts of K. 45a (in the handwriting of Leopold, Wolfgang's sister Nannerl and an unknown copyist) were discovered in the Bavarian State Library in Munich. Leopold wrote \\"√† la Haye 1766\\" on the front page next to Wolfgang's name. This implies that K. 45a was composed by Wolfgang during their stay in The Hague, possibly for the inauguration of William V, Prince of Orange on 11 March 1766. The Mozarts then took the symphony along with them on their journeys; Wolfgang revised the symphony along the way by making a few changes, especially in the inner voices.

Early life and education Born to Joseph Florath, a locksmith, and his wife Matilda, n√©e Burkart, he attended school in Brakel and the Realgymnasium in Paderborn. He was bailiff candidate in Delbr√ºck, where he was active in the welfare, church and school department and the police administration. Acting career  Florath gained first stage experience in amateur dramatic groups of local clubs in Delbr√ºck. In 1908, Florath gave up his career in office and went to Munich-Schwabing, to devote himself entirely to acting. He debuted in 1908 as a stage actor at the court theater in Munich. He took acting lessons with Alois Wohlmut and, as a sideline, wrote feuilleton contributions. When the First World War began, Florath interrupted his artistic career, volunteering as a reserve lieutenant and serving as an instructor of recruits. His wartime experiences caused him to rethink his political views and he turned towards socialism. In 1919, he served as a socialist deputy in the Bavarian National Assembly. After the failure of the Bavarian Soviet Republic and the murder of Kurt Eisner, Florath went to Berlin, where he served from 1920 until 1944 in the ensemble of the National Theatre and also directed. In 1938, Florath was designated as a Staatsschauspieler (i.e. an actor of national importance). He made his film debut in 1918. With the advent of sound film, Florath established himself as a character actor with mostly grumpy and sometimes quirky, but hearty characters. He played in literary adaptations such as Alfred D√∂blin's Berlin Alexanderplatz, Gerhart Hauptmann's The Beaver Coat and Henrik Ibsen's Nora, in dramas such as Friedrich Schiller ‚Äì The Triumph of a Genius (along with Horst Caspar), in comedies such as Die Feuerzangenbowle, but also in propaganda films such as Ich klage an (1941), Junge Adler (Young Eagles, 1944) and even in Jud S√º√ü. After the war, he returned to challenging roles, including Love '47 (based on Wolfgang Borchert's drama Drau√üen vor der T√ºr (The Man Outside) and next to Curt Goetz in Doctor Praetorius (1950) and The House in Montevideo (1951). He also took roles in the Heimatfilm genre such as Heartbroken on the Moselle (1953) and When the White Lilacs Bloom Again (1953, Romy Schneider's first film). His last stage station eventually led him to Stuttgart. Florath lived in Schlechtbach, Gschwend, from 1938 until his death in 1957.

It is operated by Extra MSA and was opened for business on 13 September 2012. Its planned opening date was scheduled to be early 2010, but was changed to early 2012 following various planning issues. The services were constructed as there was concern with the large 65 mile (104 km) gap without any service areas. At either end of that stretch of motorway was South Mimms services and Clacket Lane services, and the Secretary of State explained there was a clear and compelling need for a further service area. The other service area serving the motorway is Thurrock. Cobham services is the busiest service station in the UK. Planning Cobham services had been planned by many operators for over 10 years, and was granted planning permission twice at two separate public inquiries. The service area is built on the site of a farm named 'New Barn Farm', and opened in September 2012. The main concern about the service's construction was that the area was to be built on part of the green belt area for Cobham, However, as the whole of the M25 is situated within the green belt, the Secretary of State John Prescott overruled this objection as there was what he called a \\"clear and compelling need\\" to have a service station in the south west section of the M25.http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/local-news/m25-services-plan-put- picture-4819718 There have been other concerns that the waste from thousands of visiting tourists could damage Downside's Victorian sewage system. Layout Unusually, one service area is provided for both traffic directions and it is all located to the south of the motorway. Access from the eastbound carriageway is via a tunnel underneath the M25. Access from the west-bound carriageway is from the motorway itself. As with a number of modern service stations, many have an ecological aspect such as an sustainable drainage system, rain-harnessing or a renewable energy source. Cobham has been designed to include a sustainable drainage system that filters the water from silt and sand, cleans the water, and then naturally attenuates the water into local watercourses. Retention basins, Swales and infiltration trenches deal with excess water, storm water and most importantly flood risk. The infiltration trenches drain water using pebbles and small stones which naturally filter and store water, the remaining stored water is channeled out of the site. The retention basins collect water runoff, and the water outflow out of the basins is carefully controlled, the lakes have water piped to infiltration trenches. Even though these basins are designed to collect water and drain water in a more controlled way, some water escapes and seeps (infiltrates) into the ground. Depending on the season the water level in all of these trenches and basins change dramatically. The infiltration trenches then flow into local watercourses. The swales (marsh areas) are less complex and drain water directly into the ground, they are surrounded by vegetation. Just like infiltration trenches, swales also attenuate, filter and clean water. Vegetation which is around the service area and its drainage system, helps to absorb harmful substances to the environment and clean water in the infiltration trenches, swales, retention basins and around the site. Construction Work on the site started in Autumn 2010 and construction eventually started in mid-2011 on the slip roads and tunnel for the service area. The speed limit was reduced to 50 mph, and a temporary carriageway was set up, diverting traffic past the construction site and back onto the motorway. The 50 mph speed limit took place on a short section of the westbound carriageway, where construction traffic was accessing the site. Extra MSA founded their own construction company called 'Swayfields' immediately when Extra MSA was created in 2000, so they could construct service areas themselves. Cobham was constructed by Swayfields from 2011‚Äì2012, and all of Extra MSA's. On 10 August 2012 an opening date of 8 September 2012 was announced, later than expected due to poor weather delaying the final phases of construction. Further delays caused the opening to slip to 13 September 2012.

He was the foremost authority on the history of the city of Moscow and a key figure in the 19th-century Russian Romantic Nationalism.  Biography  Zabelin joined the Moscow Kremlin staff in 1837. Influenced by the early Muscovite \\"antiquaries\\" such as Ivan Snegirev and Pavel Stroyev, Zabelin was one of the first to investigate the history of Moscow's suburbs and monasteries. While working in the Armoury, Zabelin studied the history of metalworking and enamel work in medieval Russia. He was also considered an expert on icon-painting and Muscovite architecture. In 1859 Count Sergei Stroganov invited Zabelin to excavate the Scythian tumulus graves in South Russia and the Crimea. He is credited with introducing stratigraphic methods in Russian field archaeology. It was he who excavated the Chertomlyk grave, one of the largest Scythian kurgans. His findings are now part of the Hermitage Museum collection. Zabelin joined forces with Count Aleksey Uvarov in establishing the Russian Archaeological Society (in 1864). He summed up his findings in The Antiquities of Herodotus's Scythia (1866, 1873). In 1873 Zabelin quit archaeological pursuites and devoted himself to the study of Pre- Petrine, late medieval Muscovy. He headed the Moscow Society of History and Archaeology between 1872 and 1888 and was revered by the Romantic Nationalist artists such as Andrei Ryabushkin, Sergei Milyutin, and Viktor Vasnetsov.Russian Humanitarian Dictionary In 1894 Zabelin was elected into the Petersburg Academy of Sciences (honoris causa). Zabelin believed that the \\"soul of the people\\" manifests itself not so much in the state institutions and political history (as his German colleagues held) but in the quotidian particulars of domestic life and family relations. He elaborated his views in the series of monographs detailing the \\"private life of Russian people\\" in the 16th and 17th centuries. Zabelin's great trilogy \\"The Domestic Life of the Russian Tsars\\" (1862), \\"The Domestic Life of Russian Tsarinas\\" (1872) and \\"Great Boyars in Their Votchinas\\" (1871) is still consulted and quoted by modern historians. His magnum opus The History of the Russian Mode of Life from the Earliest Times was left unfinished.

Belgian fries with mussels, aka moules-frites, have become a national symbol. The statue of Manneken Pis in Brussels is an example of a cultural \\"belgitude\\". King Baudouin of Belgium and Queen Fabiola of Belgium are symbols of the old Belgium before it became a federal state in 1993. Baudouin died the same year the law came in effect, further symbolizing his belgitude status. Cyclist Eddy Merckx is an example of belgitude due to his international fame and the fact he was raised perfectly bi-lingual. Belgitude (French; ) is a term used to express the Belgian soul and identity. Context Contrary to most other countries Belgians have a mixed feeling towards their identity as one people. This is a result of being occupied by many foreign European powers throughout the centuries, which led to an inferiority complex about their status and power in the world. The regions were conquered by Romans, French, Burgondia, Spain, Austria-Hungary, the French again and finally the Netherlands before becoming independent in 1830. And even then they were occupied again by the Germans during the First World War and Second World War. Another aspect contributing to belgitude is the fact that many Belgians identify more with being Flemish, Walloon or part of Brussels, but even within those groups many feel more attached to being part of a city or province than any national or community identity. There have been countless issues between the Flemish and Walloon communities throughout Belgian history that often lead to intense political discussions and crisises in Belgian parliament. The Belgian identity is seen as a \\"hollow\\" identity: it is defined mostly by what it is not. For example, the Belgian is neither French, Dutch or German. At the time of the term's coinage, it was not accepted by the general population, and the term seemed to have \\"more cultural than political weight\\". At the time, belgitude could be synonymous with marginality. Susan Bainbrigge defines it as \\"a term that represents [the] new approach to francophone Belgium specificity [that emerged] in the 1970s and 1980s\\". It involved the extent of the questioning identity of Belgians with the sense of self-mockery that characterizes them. History of the Belgian feeling of identity During his conquest of Gaul in 54 BCE Julius Caesar wrote in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico about the three Celtic tribes that inhabited the country, namely the Aquitani in the southwest, the Gauls of the biggest central part, who in their own language were called Celtae, and the Belgae in the north. Caesar famously wrote that the Belgae were \\"the bravest of the three peoples, being farthest removed from the highly developed civilization of the Roman Province, least often visited by merchants with enervating luxuries for sale, and nearest to the Germans across the Rhine, with whom they are continually at war\\".Julius Caesar, The Conquest of Gaul Gallico, trans. S. A. Handford, revised with a new introduction by Jane F. Gardner (Penguin Books 1982), I.1. Despite Caesar referring to the Celtic tribe the Belgae and not modern day Belgium the quote was used a lot in Belgian history books from the 1830s on while the new independent state searched for its own identity. The most famous quote about the Belgian identity was said by the Walloon socialist politician Jules Destr√©e. According to Destr√©e, Belgium was composed of two separate entities, Flanders and Wallonia, and a feeling of Belgian nationalism was not possible, illustrated in his 1906 work \\"Une id√©e qui meurt: la patrie\\" (An idea that is dying: the fatherland). In the \\"Revue de Belgique\\" of 15 August 1912 he articulated this in his famous and notorious \\"Lettre au roi sur la s√©paration de la Wallonie et de la Flandre\\" (Letter to the king on the separation of Wallonia and Flanders), where he wrote: Contrary to later interpretations Destr√©e didn't favor separatism, but wanted a move to a federal state. King Albert I of Belgium wrote an official answer to the letter, which read: I read the letter of Destr√©e, which, without uncertainty, is some literature of great talent. All that he said is absolutely true, but it is not less true that administrative separation would be an evil with more disadvantages and dangers than any aspect of the current situation. J'ai lu la lettre de Destr√©e qui, sans conteste, est un litt√©rateur de grand talent. Tout ce qu'il dit est absolument vrai, mais il est non moins vrai que la s√©paration administrative serait un mal entra√Ænant plus d'inconv√©nients et de dangers de tout genre que la situation actuelle. Landro, 30 ao√ªt, A Jules Ingebleek, secr√©taire priv√© du Roi et de la Reine, lettre reproduite in extenso in M-R Thielemans et E. Vandewoude, Le Roi Albert au travers de ses lettres in√©dites, Office international de librairie, Bruxelles, 1982, pp. 435-436. In 1960 Flemish politician Gaston Eyskens modified this quote, saying \\"Sire, il n'y a plus de Belges\\" (Sire, there are no more Belgians), after the first steps were taken to transform Belgium into a federal state. Etymology The neologism \\"belgitude\\" was coined in 1976, by Pierre Mertens and Claude Jevaeu in an issue of the Nouvelles litt√©raires called \\"L'autre Belgique\\". It alludes to the term n√©gritude about feeling black, expressed by Leopold Sedar Senghor. The term caught on quick enough to be referred to in Belgian singer Jacques Brel's song \\"Mai 1940\\" (\\"May 1940\\"), which was left off his final album Les Marquises in 1977, but made available in 2003. In the song Brel refers to German soldiers who occupied Belgium during World War Two and wiped out his belgitude: D'un ciel plus bleu qu'√† l'habitude, (Translation: \\"From a heaven bluer than usual\\") Ce mai 40 a salu√© (Translation: \\"That May 1940 greeted\\") Quelques Allemands disciplin√©s (Translation: \\"Several disciplined Germans\\") Qui √©crasaient ma belgitude, (Translation: \\"Who wiped out my belgitude\\".) In 2012 the word \\"Belgitude\\" was listed in the French encyclopedia, the Petit Larousse ¬´ ¬´ Belgitude ¬ª dans le Petit Larousse illustr√© ¬ª dans 7sur7.be, 27 juin 2011, consult√© le 28 juin 2011 Examples of belgitudes Belgitude is characterised by things that are unique to Belgian culture, such as Belgian Dutch and Belgian French. The Dutch in Belgium has many gallicisms and the French in Belgium many hollandisms, both in terms of words as well as grammar. The word \\"bourgemestre\\" (mayor) in Wallonia, for instance, is clearly inspired by the Dutch word \\"burgemeester\\" and differs considerably from the commonly accepted French word \\"maire\\". The word \\"plezant\\" (\\"amusing\\") in Flanders is a derivation of the French word \\"plaisant\\" and is hardly used in The Netherlands. Typical foods and drinks, such as Belgian beer, moules frites, speculaas, waterzooi, witloof, Brussels sprouts, Belgian chocolate,... are also seen as examples of belgitude, because they are often promoted abroad. People who were important to Belgian history are also often cited: Ambiorix, Godfrey of Bouillon, Charles V of Spain, Adolphe Sax, Baudouin of Belgium, as are cultural icons such as Manneken Pis, the Gilles of Binche, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, Tintin, Inspector Maigret, the Atomium, Jacques Brel, Ren√© Magritte, Soeur Sourire, Django Reinhardt,... In the fields of sport Eddy Merckx and the Red Devils are a good example. The song \\"Potverdekke! (It's great to be a Belgian)\\" (1998) by Mr. John is also an expression of belgitude. The satirical comedy and film adaptation Sois Belge et tais-toi, the films of Jan Bucquoy https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bucquoy_jan.htm and the comedy team Les Snuls are all loving and mocking tributes to the Belgian identity.

Early life and career  Malcolm Leyland Lipkin was born in Liverpool. While a schoolboy at Liverpool College, he studied the piano privately with Gordon Green from 1944 to 1948, and theory with Dr. Caleb Jarvis. In 1949 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London, where he continued his piano studies with Kendall Taylor until 1953, as well as harmony and counterpoint with Bernard Stevens. Lipkin began his compositional career writing music for his instrument. He played his Second Piano Sonata to Georges Enesco at the 1950 Bryanston Summer School of Music, where he also took composition lessons from Boris Blacher.Good, Hamish. 'The Music of Malcolm Lipkin' in The Musical Times, December 1969, p 1237-40. From 1954 to 1957 Lipkin studied composition with M√°ty√°s Seiber and later read music externally at London University for his B.Mus under the guidance of Dr. Anthony Milner, eventually being awarded the degree of D.Mus.Lond for his published, reviewed, publicly performed works. His first major success was the Violin Sonata No 1 (1957), which received over 100 performances within a year of its composition.Burn, Andrew. Liner notes to Recollections, Divine Art CD DDA 25202 (2020) This was written for the violinist Yfrah Neaman and premiered by Neaman and Howard Ferguson. Neaman then commissioned the second Violin Concerto (1960-62). The death of Seiber in 1960 in a car accident, while on a lecture tour in South Africa, had shocked Lipkin, and the middle movement of the concerto was written in his memory. Like much of Lipkin's music in the 1960s, the concerto was composed in his early tonal style. The String Trio, dedicated to Joy Finzi, to whose country home at Ashmansworth he was encouraged to come and compose, followed in 1964. In 1966 the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned Lipkin's first Symphony, the Sinfonia di Roma.Notes on Sinfonia di Roma, composer's web site This was a turning point in his developing style, revealing the influence of Seiber in its construction from small melodic and rhythmic cells. However, Lipkin never fully adopted serial technique, so fashionable in the 1960s, and he always remained his own man, becoming something of an outsider in the context of compositional trends of the time, eventually finding an individual identity in his later music.  Later years  During the 1970s, the influence of 17th-century English poetry resulted in Four Departures for Soprano and Violin (settings of Herrick) and The Pursuit (Symphony No. 2), inspired by a quatrain of Andrew Marvell. Herrick was again a starting point for another major work, Sun (Symphony No.3), premiered in 1993. It is structured in arch form, with the three movements representing the morning, noon and evening of human life, and with the central scherzo representing noon, or (in the composer's words) the zenith.Headington, Christopher. 'Malcolm Lipkin and His Recent Music' in Tempo, June 1989, p 28-33. It is in such works as the Third Symphony and the Oboe Concerto of 1988 (commissioned by the BBC) that Lipkin found his personal voice.Conway, Paul. Notes to Malcolm Lipkin, The Symphonies, Lyrita CD LYO349 (2015) As Meredith Oakes commented on The Pursuit: \\"Lipkin, who studied with Seiber and Blacher, doesn't exactly sound new but he doesn't sound like anyone else either.\\"Oakes, Meredith. In The Listener Issue 2799, 17 February 1983 p 27 Chamber music was the primary focus of his later years, with works such as the Wind Quintet (1985), Variations on a Theme of Bartok for string quartet (1989), and the Second Violin Sonata (1997). He also returned to composing for the piano in later years, completing his Sixth Sonata in 2002. His eight Nocturnes were composed over a 21 year period between 1987 and 2008. For many years he was a member of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain and for a time served on its Executive Committee. He was a Patron of the Seiber Trust. Lipkin died on 2 June 2017. His final work was The Journey for recorder solo (2016) written as a tribute to fellow composer (and Liverpudlian) John McCabe.MusicWeb International  Principal compositions  Orchestral * Sinfonia di

John Thomas likely supervised construction and John P. Salmon was the master mason. It was equipped with Scottish machinery installed by Scot James Ralston, and produced fifty tons of pig iron per week. Bituminous coal was mined at nearby Minersville and transported by inclined plane. Transportation of iron ore was from over 100 miles away via canal, but this proved difficult, as did transportation of flux from the Nittany Valley. The financial Panic of 1837 forced the furnace to close in 1838.

Freedom of Information Act requests were used to obtain declassification of the Clark Clifford Report, 22 hot-line messages, 22 National Security Agency documents, and 31 National Security Council documents. Cristol was also able to obtain classified Israeli documents. The conclusion of his dissertation confirmed the official investigations and demonstrated that the attack on the USS Liberty was a mistake.Cristol, A Jay, \\"The Liberty incident\\" (1997). Dissertations from ProQuest. Paper 3444. [Link or ISBN or equivalent neededdate=May 2017] Following completion of course work, Cristol continued to pursue information surrounding the event. He sued the National Security Agency under the Freedom of Information Act. In 2004 the agency released audio tapes which had been collected by an NSA unit aboard a Navy Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft flying near the scene of the USS Liberty attack. Subsequently, Cristol published his analysis in 2002 as a book about the attack, The Liberty Incident: The 1967 Attack on the U.S. Navy Spy Ship.The Liberty Incident: About the Author Cristol concluded that the tapes show the attack was an accident, and that the Israelis mistook the ship for an Egyptian warship.David Ensor.

He is engaged to be married to Myra, the cab company's dispatcher, a former member of the Women's Royal Naval Service. While picking up a fare, Martin witnesses a bank robbery and tails the criminals, but his cab is wrecked during the chase. The police find a well- known safe-cracker dead of apparent natural causes and ask Martin to go undercover, join the bank-robbery gang, and expose its leader. His boss arranges a sham firing based on his having wrecked his cab, but this causes a revolt among the cabbies, who plan to go on strike to support his reinstatement. The robbery is carried off, but the gang discovers Martin's identity and tries to kill him by locking him in a deep freezer at an ice cream factory.

Opened in 1855, the station is owned and operated by SBB-CFF-FFS. It forms the junction between the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway, the Schaffhausen‚ÄìRorschach railway and the Romanshorn‚ÄìNesslau Neu St. Johann railway. The SBB-CFF-FFS and THURBO operate both long-distance and local traffic to and from the station. These include four St. Gallen S-Bahn lines and an InterCity train to Brig. Location Romanshorn railway station is situated in Neustrasse, at the eastern edge of the city centre. On the other side of the tracks is the Romanshorn ferry terminal, for ferries across Lake Constance. History Early years After two years of planning, the station was opened in 1855, together with the first stage of the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway, of which it was a terminus. Also in 1855, the station building was erected, according to plans by Johann Jakob Breitinger. In 1869, the Swiss Northeastern Railway () put into service the Seelinie between Romanshorn and Rorschach. In the same year, the Lake Constance train ferry was established, for cross-border goods traffic to and from Germany between Romanshorn and Friedrichshafen, and between Lindau and Bregenz. In 1871, the railway connection with Kreuzlingen Hafen and over the border to Konstanz was handed over to traffic. On 1 October 1910, the Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn opened the line to Nesslau, via St. Gallen and Wattwil. The train ferry to Lindau and Bregenz was suspended with the outbreak of World War II, and the link with Friedrichshafen was discontinued in 1976, after 107 years of operation.  Modernisation 2001‚Äì2003  After a major renovation at the beginning of the 20th century, almost no significant modifications were made to the passenger station for nearly 90 years. Around the turn of the millennium, the signals and points (switches) at the station were still controlled by signal boxes equipped with mechanical lever frames made by the Braunschweig firm of J√ºdel in 1912. The southern station throat was spanned by the last signal gantry in Switzerland. Also, the public facilities were outdated, and access to tracks 5 and 6 was via a level crossing, which was secured by the legendary \\"Chetteli\\", i.e. chains and a roller shutter. To enable interchange with the ferries, trains to and from Z√ºrich had to be moved during their layovers, make the pathway to the ferry terminal accessible. The SBB-CFF-FFS therefore decided to make an investment of 50 million francs in the modernization of the station. The contribution to be made by the local community was approved in a referendum with an 86 percent \\"yes\\" vote. The modernisation work began in the summer of 2001, and lasted until the end of November 2003. Track 1, the locomotive shed dating from 1900, various other buildings and the tracks of the former goods depot were all taken out of service. The mechanical signal frames were replaced by a Siemens SIMIS C type electronic system, and therefore the signals and the manually operated barriers were also replaced. Comfort was also greatly improved in the public areas of the station. The \\"Chetteli-√úbergang\\" was replaced with a generous pedestrian underpass. New passenger information leaflet displays and screens were installed to replace the lever operated boards dating from 1920. The platforms were raised, and the roofs and speakers were renewed. The two kiosks were replaced by a new building. Thanks to an extension of Platform 2, express trains to Z√ºrich can now use Track 3. As part of this modernisation work, the Bahnhofplatz was renovated. National publicity for the renovations was ensured by the sculpture of the mythical creature \\"mocmoc\\", a creation of the artist duo Com&Com.; The local controversy about the sculpture resulted in a 2004 referendum.  Developments since 2003  The SBB-CFF-FFS locomotive shed and the signal boxes have been operated since 2003 by the Verein Historische Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn, and since 2005 also by the Stiftung Historisches Bahnhof-Ensemble Romanshorn, as Locorama, a railway world of experience. The historic signal gantry, the coaling stage and the water crane are also part of Locorama. As part of Rail 2000, an InterCity service, operating to an hourly clock-face timetable using IC2000 trains, was established between Romanshorn and Brig.

It is sometimes referred to as \\"isolated word recognition\\" because it involves a reader's ability to recognize words individually from a list without needing similar words for contextual help. LINCS continues to say that \\"rapid and effortless word recognition is the main component of fluent reading\\" and explains that these skills can be improved by \\"practic[ing] with flashcards, lists, and word grids\\". In her 1990 review of the science of learning to read, psychologist Marilyn Jager Adams wrote that \\"the single immutable and nonoptional fact about skilful reading is that it involves relatively complete processing of the individual letters of print.\\" The article \\"The Science of Word Recognition\\" says that \\"evidence from the last 20 years of work in cognitive psychology indicates that we use the letters within a word to recognize a word\\". Over time, other theories have been put forth proposing the mechanisms by which words are recognized in isolation, yet with both speed and accuracy. These theories focus more on the significance of individual letters and letter-shape recognition (ex. serial letter recognition and parallel letter recognition). Other factors such as saccadic eye movements and the linear relationship between letters also affect the way we recognize words. An article in ScienceDaily suggests that \\"early word recognition is key to lifelong reading skills\\". There are different ways to develop these skills. For example, creating flash cards for words that appear at a high frequency is considered a tool for overcoming dyslexia. It has been argued that prosody, the patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry, can improve word recognition.ftp://128.46.154.21/harper/muri/Chen_PDSR_SP04.pdf Word recognition is a manner of reading based upon the immediate perception of what word a familiar grouping of letters represents. This process exists in opposition to phonetics and word analysis, as a different method of recognizing and verbalizing visual language (i.e. reading).(Kruidenier, 2002) Word recognition functions primarily on automaticity. On the other hand, phonetics and word analysis rely on the basis of cognitively applying learned grammatical rules for the blending of letters, sounds, graphemes, and morphemes. Word recognition is measured as a matter of speed, such that a word with a high level of recognition is read faster than a novel one.(Larsen, 2004) This manner of testing suggests that comprehension of the meaning of the words being read is not required, but rather the ability to recognize them in a way that allows proper pronunciation. Therefore, context is unimportant, and word recognition is often assessed with words presented in isolation in formats such as flash cards Nevertheless, ease in word recognition, as in fluency, enables proficiency that fosters comprehension of the text being read.(Luckner & Urbach, 2012) The intrinsic value of word recognition may be obvious due to the prevalence of literacy in modern society. However, its role may be less conspicuous in the areas of literacy learning, second-language learning, and developmental delays in reading. As word recognition is better understood, more reliable and efficient forms of teaching may be discovered for both children and adult learners of first-language literacy. Such information may also benefit second-language learners with acquisition of novel words and letter characters.(Everson, 2011) Furthermore, a better understanding of the processes involved in word recognition may enable more specific treatments for individuals with reading disabilities.  Theories   Bouma shape  Bouma shape, named after the Dutch vision researcher Herman Bouma, refers to the overall outline, or shape, of a word.(Ranum, 1998) Herman Bouma discussed the role of \\"global word shape\\" in his word recognition experiment conducted in 1973.(Bouma & Bouwhuis, 1979) Theories of bouma shape became popular in word recognition, suggesting people recognize words from the shape the letters make in a group relative to each other. This contrasts the idea that letters are read individually. Instead, via prior exposure, people become familiar with outlines, and thereby recognize them the next time they are presented with the same word, or bouma. The slower pace with which people read words written entirely in upper-case, or with alternating upper- and lower-case letters, supports the bouma theory. The theory holds that a novel bouma shape created by changing the lower-case letters to upper-case hinders a person's recall ability. James Cattell also supported this theory through his study, which gave evidence for an effect he called word superiority. This referred to the improved ability of people to deduce letters if the letters were presented within a word, rather than a mix of random letters. Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated that readers are less likely to notice misspelled words with a similar bouma shape than misspelled words with a different bouma shape. Though these effects have been consistently replicated, many of their findings have been contested. Some have suggested that the reading ability of upper-case words is due to the amount of practice a person has with them. People who practice become faster at reading upper- case words, countering the importance of the bouma. Additionally, the word superiority effect might result from familiarity with phonetic combinations of letters, rather than the outlines of words, according to psychologists James McClelland and James Johnson.(McClelland & Johnston, 1977)  Parallel recognition vs. serial recognition  Parallel letter recognition is the most widely accepted model of word recognition by psychologists today. In this model, all letters within a group are perceived simultaneously for word recognition. In contrast, the serial recognition model proposes that letters are recognized individually, one by one, before being integrated for word recognition. It predicts that single letters are identified faster and more accurately than many letters together, as in a word. However, this model was rejected because it cannot explain the word superiority effect, which states that readers can identify letters more quickly and accurately in the context of a word rather than in isolation.  Neural networks  A more modern approach to word recognition has been based on recent research on neuron functioning. The visual aspects of a word, such as horizontal and vertical lines or curves, are thought to activate word-recognizing receptors. From those receptors, neural signals are sent to either excite or inhibit connections to other words in a person's memory. The words with characters that match the visual representation of the observed word receive excitatory signals. As the mind further processes the appearance of the word, inhibitory signals simultaneously reduce activation to words in one's memory with a dissimilar appearance. This neural strengthening of connections to relevant letters and words, as well as the simultaneous weakening of associations with irrelevant ones, eventually activates the correct word as part of word recognition in the neural network.  Physiological background   The brain  Using positron emission tomography (PET) scans and event-related potentials, researchers have located two separate areas in the fusiform gyrus that respond specifically to strings of letters. The posterior fusiform gyrus responds to words and non-words, regardless of their semantic context.(Nobre, Truett & McCarthy, 1994) The anterior fusiform gyrus is affected by the semantic context, and whether letter combinations are words or pseudowords (novel letter combinations that mimic phonetic conventions, ex. shing). This role of the anterior fusiform gyrus may correlate to higher processing of the word's concept and meaning. Both these regions are distinct from areas that respond to other types of complex stimuli, such as faces or colored patterns, and are part of a functionally specialized ventral pathway. Within 100 milliseconds (ms) of fixating on a word, an area of the left inferotemporal cortex processes its surface structure. Semantic information begins to be processed after 150 ms and shows widely distributed cortical network activation. After 200 ms, the integration of the different kinds of information occurs.(Hauk, Davis, Ford, Pulvermuller & Marslen-Wilson, 2006) The accuracy with which readers recognize words depends on the area of the retina that is stimulated.(Mishkin, Mortimer, Forgays & Donald, 1952) Reading in English selectively trains specific regions of the left hemiretina for processing this type of visual information, making this part of the visual field optimal for word recognition. As words drift from this optimal area, word recognition accuracy declines. Because of this training, effective neural organization develops in the corresponding left cerebral hemisphere.  Saccadic eye movements and fixations  Eyes make brief, unnoticeable movements called saccades approximately three to four times per second.(Irwin, 1998) Saccades are separated by fixations, which are moments when the eyes are not moving. During saccades, visual sensitivity is diminished, which is called saccadic suppression. This ensures that the majority of the intake of visual information occurs during fixations. Lexical processing does, however, continue during saccades. The timing and accuracy of word recognition relies on where in the word the eye is currently fixating. Recognition is fastest and most accurate when fixating in the middle of the word. This is due to a decrease in visual acuity that results as letters are situated farther from the fixated location and become harder to see.(Nazir, Heller & Sussman, 1992  Frequency effects  The word frequency effect suggests that words that appear the most in printed language are easier to recognize than words that appear less frequently.(Grainger, 1990) Recognition of these words is faster and more accurate than other words. The word frequency effect is one of the most robust and most commonly reported effects in contemporary literature on word recognition. It has played a role in the development of many theories, such as the bouma shape. Furthermore, the neighborhood frequency effect states that word recognition is slower and less accurate when the target has an orthographic neighbor that is higher in frequency than itself. Orthographic neighbors are words of all the same length that differ by only one letter of that word.  Real world applications   Inter-letter spacing  Serif fonts, i.e.: fonts with small appendages at the end of strokes, hinder lexical access. Word recognition is quicker with sans-serif fonts by an average of 8 ms.(Moret-Tatay & Perea, 2011) These fonts have significantly more inter- letter spacing, and studies have shown that responses to words with increased inter-letter spacing were faster, regardless of word frequency and length.(Pereaa, Moret-Tataya & Gomezc, 2011) This demonstrates an inverse relationship between fixation duration and small increases in inter-letter spacing,(Perea & Gomez 2012) most likely due to a reduction in lateral inhibition in the neural network. When letters are farther apart, it is more likely that individuals will focus their fixations at the beginning of words, whereas default letter spacing on word processing software encourages fixation at the center of words.  Tools and measurements  Both PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are used to study the activation of various parts of the brain while participants perform reading-based tasks.(Sereno & Rayner, 2003) However, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide a more accurate temporal measurement by recording event-related potentials each millisecond. Though identifying where the electrical responses occur can be easier with an MEG, an EEG is a more pervasive form of research in word recognition. Event-related potentials help measure both the strength and the latency of brain activity in certain areas during readings. Furthermore, by combining the usefulness of the event-related potentials with eye movement monitoring, researchers are able to correlate fixations during readings with word recognition in the brain in real-time. Since saccades and fixations are indicative of word recognition, electrooculography (EOG) is used to measure eye movements and the amount of time required for lexical access to target words. This has been demonstrated by studies in which longer, less common words induce longer fixations, and smaller, less important words may not be fixated on at all while reading a sentence.  Learning  According to the LINCS website, the role of word recognition results in differences between the habits of adults and the habits of children learning how to read. For non-literate adults learning to read, many rely more on word recognition than on phonics and word analysis. Poor readers with prior knowledge concerning the target words can recognize words and make fewer errors than poor readers with no prior knowledge.(Priebe, Keenan & Miller, 2010) Instead of blending sounds of individual letters, adult learners are more likely to recognize words automatically. However, this can lead to errors when a similarly spelled, yet different word, is mistaken for one the reader is familiar with. Errors such as these are considered to be due to the learner's experiences and exposure. Younger and newer learners tend to focus more on the implications from the text and rely less on background knowledge or experience. Poor readers with prior knowledge utilize the semantic aspects of the word, whereas proficient readers rely on only graphic information for word recognition. However, practice and improved proficiency tend to lead to a more efficient use of combining reading ability and background knowledge for effective word recognition. The role of the frequency effect has been greatly incorporated into the learning process. While the word analysis approach is extremely beneficial, many words defy regular grammatical structures and are more easily incorporated into the lexical memory by automatic word recognition. To facilitate this, many educational experts highlight the importance of repetition in word exposure. This utilizes the frequency effect by increasing the reader's familiarity with the target word, and thereby improving both future speed and accuracy in reading. This repetition can be in the form of flash cards, word-tracing, reading aloud, picturing the word, and other forms of practice that improve the association of the visual text with word recall.(Literacy Information and Communication System)  Role of technology  Improvements in technology have greatly contributed to advances in the understanding and research in word recognition. New word recognition capabilities have made computer-based learning programs more effective and reliable. Improved technology has enabled eye-tracking, which monitors individuals' saccadic eye movements while they read. This has furthered understanding of how certain patterns of eye movement increases word recognition and processing. Furthermore, changes can be simultaneously made to text just outside the reader's area of focus without the reader being made aware. This has provided more information on where the eye focuses when an individual is reading and where the boundaries of attention lie. With this additional information, researchers have proposed new models of word recognition that can be programmed into computers. As a result, computers can now mimic how a human would perceive and react to language and novel words. This technology has advanced to the point where models of literacy learning can be digitally demonstrated. For example, a computer can now mimic a child's learning progress and induce general language rules when exposed to a list of words with only a limited number of explanations. Nevertheless, as no universal model has yet been agreed upon, the generalizability of word recognition models and its simulations may be limited.(Davis & Mermelstein, 1980) Despite this lack of consensus regarding parameters in simulation designs, any progress in the area of word recognition is helpful to future research regarding which learning styles may be most successful in classrooms. Correlations also exist between reading ability, spoken language development, and learning disabilities. Therefore, advances in any one of these areas may assist understanding in inter-related subjects.(Scarborough, 2009) Ultimately, the development of word recognition may facilitate the breakthrough between \\"learning to read\\" and \\"reading to learn\\".(Campbell, Kelly, Mullis, Martin & Sainsbury, 2001, p.6)  References   Citations  * Bouma, H., & Bouwhuis, D.

The opposition, led by Derek Sikua, decried the announcement, noting that $4 million in renovations had been completed at Red House since August 2010. In November 2011, newly elected Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo reversed the previous government's plans. He announced that he would move into Red House from his residence at the Honiara Hotel, citing a need to spend less taxpayer money on hotel or home rentals for election officials. At a press conference, he announced, \\"I would like to inform the people of Solomon Islands that the Prime Minister will be moving back to the Red House as soon as a minor repair on the residence is complete... I do not intend to reside anywhere else, and wish to tell the people that this Prime Minister will be moving out and into the Red House in a matter of days.\\" Lilo said he would take up residence as soon as minor repairs, such as new locks, were installed.

Patton) during the making of Six Million And One. Photo taken by Irit Shimrat Joseph Fischer's memoir was discovered only after his death. His children refused to confront it, except for David, the filmmaker, for whom it became a compass for a long journey. When David found it unbearable to be alone in the wake of his father's survival story and in his struggle not to lose his sanity, he convinced his brothers and sister to join him in the hope that this would also contribute to releasing tensions and bring them as close as they used to be. His siblings, for their part, couldn't understand why anyone should want to dig into the past instead of enjoying life in the present. The journey eventually leads the Fishers into the dark depths of the B8 Bergkristall tunnels, part of the Austrian KZ Gusen II concentration camp, where their father endured forced labor during the Holocaust. Gusen Memorial Committee Illuminated only by flashlights, they seek meaning in their personal and family histories and undergo surgical and revealing discussions about family, survival and individualism only to come to the realization that they are unable to fully understand their father's past and the events that haunted him. Joseph Fischer's last couple of weeks at Gunskirchen concentration camp, were an inhuman experience that blocked his writing. In order to find out what his father failed to describe about Gunskirchen's liberation David located veterans of the 71st Infantry Division \\"Who were Those Men\\" article on the 71st Infantry Division who liberated the camp.

Sartorius is a former director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Division of Mental Health, and a former president of the World Psychiatric Association and of the European Psychiatric Association. He has been described as \\"one of the most prominent and influential psychiatrists of his generation\\". Biography Sartorius was born in M√ºnster, Germany but grew up in Koprivnica and Zagreb, Croatia After his parents separated, he was raised by his mother, Feƒëa Fischer-Sartorius, a renowned pediatrician. Sartorius obtained his M.D. from the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb in 1958, and his B.Sc. and M.A. in psychology from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb in 1962. He finished his specialization in psychiatry and neurology in 1963 and defended his Ph.D. thesis in psychology at the University of Zagreb in 1965. After obtaining his Ph.D., and passing the speciality tests for Neurology and Psychiatry Sartorius spent two years at the University of London on a British Council stipend. In 1967, Sartorius left his job at the University Hospital Center in Zagreb to join the WHO. as the Head of the WHO Interregional Advisory Team on Epidemiology of Mental Disorders. He then took the position of Medical Officer responsible for epidemiological and social psychiatry and in 1974 became the Chief of the Mental Health Unit. In 1977 he was appointed Director of the Division of Mental Health of WHO, a position which he held until 1993. He served as the President of the World Psychiatric Association (1993‚Äì1999) and of the Association of European Psychiatrists (1997‚Äì2001). Sartorius became a full professor at the University of Geneva in 1993. Sartorius also held full professorships at the University of Zagreb and University of Prague. He retired as a full professor in Geneva and Prague in 2001. He has worked as a visiting or adjunct professor at the University of London, Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, the University of Beijing, Washington University in St. Louis, the New York University, the University of Belgrade and the University of Florida. Sartorius is a Fellow of the British Royal Society of Medicine, honorary member of Medical Academies in Croatia, Mexico and Peru, and a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Spain and of the Croatian Academy of Arts and sciences, Honoris causa Doctor of Medicine of the Ume√• University, of the Timi»ôoara/Temisvar University Victor Babes and of the Charles University in Prague. He is also an Honorary Doctor of Science of the University of Bath in 1990. and an honorary doctor of psychology of the University of Copenhagen. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists of the United Kingdom, and of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. He is a Fellow or an honorary member of numerous other professional organizations.  Scientific work  Sartorius' work deals with epidemiology of mental disorders and social psychiatry as well as with various issues related to schizophrenia, depression, and health service delivery. Major themes in his current work and public activity are rights of patients with mental disorders and struggle against stigma and prejudices associated with mental illness, co morbidity of mental and physical illness and improvement of mental health services. Between 1961 and 2008, Sartorius published more than 400 scientific works. According to the Web of Science, Sartorius' articles have been cited more than 35.000 times, and his h-index is 76. He has authored, co-authored or edited 66 books. At the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in 2007, Sartorius disclosed his conflict of interests.

A special priest or baba has said that their fate has been intertwined; whatever happens to Nazia will affect Shazia's fate as well, but in a negative way. Nazia, a shy and secretive girl takes this seriously whereas Shazia, a bold and rebellious girl thinks this is all nonsense. When Shazia finds out there is an interesting Bollywood movie that showing at the cinema, she decides that both her and Nazia should go and see the movie even though the elders of their home will not give them consent to do so. They skip college and leave for the movie where they meet Shahbaz who directs them to the proper entrance to the cinema. Being new to the whole concept of movies at the cinema, they buy tickets thinking that the drinks and popcorn will be included. When they are told to pay the bill, Shazia refuses and starts a fight with the cashier. In the meantime, the man who showed them to the entrance, Shebaz, comes in and they find out that he is the owner of the shop. He tries to explain the situation to Shazia and even negotiates with her, but she misunderstands his courtesy for flirting. He then allows them to take the drinks an tells them they can pay him off later. The girls ask him to collect the Rs. 300 that they owe him from outside their college the next day however they do not have enough money so Nazia tells him that she will pay him off in installments of Rs. 50 per month. Shehbaz starts to like Nazia and gives her his number. She rings him and he asks her to him in the restaurant. Nazia and Shazia both go to meet Shebaz at the restaurant where he proposes to Nazia and asks if he can marry her. As they lift their bhurkas, they're spotted by a relative who takes them home and falsely accuses them. On hearing this, the three women in the house panic. Nazia's mother Salima (Samina Peerzada) stops her from going to college thereafter. Both Shazia's and Nazia's weddings get fixed, Shazia's to an American educated man called Moeez and Nazia's to a man called Fahad, who has an overbearing mother. However, on the night of the wedding, Nazia's plans to flee with Shehbaz, only to be caught in the nick of time by her phoopi ammi. Therefore, both marriages take place. After the marriage, problems arise for the two girls. Moeez (Shazia's husband) loses his job and ends up living in a small flat, whilst Shazia takes up a job in a primary school as a means of financial support. Moeez, arrogantly, refuses to apply for jobs that he thinks are beneath him. In Nazia's household, her husband finds out about Shehbaz, but does nothing. Then her mother in law starts hounding her for a grandchild, preferably a boy. Things continue to get worse to Shazia, when her husband starts drinking and beating her, eventually they have to move back to Moeez's parents house because of money worries. Moeez's father is cruel and beats his wife (Moeez's mother). This is the reason Moeez cannot stand him, and is emerges that he only married Shazia to spite his father. Whilst all this is happening, Nazia falls pregnant and her mother in law goes crazy buying blue things, as she expects a boy. Nazia doesn't mind the gender, neither does Fahad but he keeps quiet to please this mother. Shazia has an argument with Moeez and moves back to her maternal home. Her mother is not told of the argument in case it upsets her fragile heart, as she has had major surgery. Her phoopi ammi and her chotti ammi (Nazia's mum), try and convince her to go home, which she does and reveals to Moeez that she too is pregnant. Nazia on the other hand finds out that she is expecting a girl, due to a sonogram she attends with her husband. She is ready to reveal all to her mother in law but her husband cuts in and lies that she's having a boy. Moeez gets badly beaten up by Shehbaz, for harassing Nazia on the phone which makes him realise how much Shazia cares for him when she tends to his wounds. On Nazia's baby shower, the truth gets revealed about the baby's gender and Nazia's mother in law kicks her out and claims that the baby isn't even Fahad's. She then pesters Fahad to divorce Nazia, when he has already promised to stick by Nazia whatever happens. Due to all the pressure of the situation, he kills himself. On his funeral, his mother breaks down and begs Nazia's family for forgiveness, finally having realised her mistake. When Nazia hears of his suicide she goes into early labour. Upon giving birth and returning home, she sinks into depression. Her mother, Salima, then encourages her to go back to college and make something of herself, which she does. In the last episode, Nazia takes her daughter to meet Fahad's mum, who apologises for what she has done and also encourages Nazia to marry Shehbaz. Shehbaz then meets Nazia and says that he is moving abroad, which prompts her to accept his proposal and make him stay. They are then shown married and as a happy family. Shazia meanwhile also delivers her baby and is seen watching a film with Moeez in their bedroom. Moeez shows her job opportunities for him in the US and asks whether she'll consider a move to there. Shazia supports him and they too are seen to be happy together.

Its style has been called national miniature realism. The novel is about the quiet life of a couple living in the middle of the woods and their attempts at imagining what a railroad is based on what they have heard. Rautatie is one of the classics of Finnish literature, and has had more than twenty editions by the start of the 21st century. It has been called Aho's first \\"artistic full hit\\".Laitinen, Kai: Suomen kirjallisuuden historia, p. 236 In 2007, WSOY published a perfect copy of the 1892 colour edition illustrated by Eero J√§rnefelt. A TV film by the same name was made based on the novel in 1973. The novel has also been adapted to numerous plays. The central elements in Rautatie are the imaginations of small-time agrarians and the differences between poor, far-away places and richer places, and the social gap between the \\"lords\\" and the \\"common people\\". One important element is over-use of alcoholic beverages, which is a common theme in Finnish literature as the start of decadent events.Laitinen, Kai: Suomen kirjallisuuden historia, p. 238 Background Rautatie was written in spring and summer 1884 and published in December in the same year. Aho had become familiar with the \\"common people\\" in his home village of Vierem√§ in Iisalmi from 1876. Starting from his matriculation in 1880 he had frequently travelled by train between his home and Helsinki. People living in far-away places attached fantasy to the railroad in their minds. The railroad was a subject of political controversy during the diets in the 1880s, which Aho closely followed as a journalist. Aho's closest friends included the J√§rnefelt family, whose critic significantly influenced the artistic form of Rautatie. Especially Kasper J√§rnefelt was involved in fixing the miniature novel page by page. Minna Canth praised Rautatie as a masterpiece already when it was first published. She got to read the script in August 1884.Juhani Aho part I, p. 563 Notes There have been hundreds of thousands of copies of Rautatie printed in its original Finnish. An English translation by Owen Witesman was published in 2013 as The Railroad. It has also been translated to Swedish (J√§rnv√§gen), Estonian (Raudtee), German (Die Eisenbahn) and to four other languages. The Finnish edition has also been published as Rautatie eli Kertomus ukosta ja akasta, jotka eiv√§t olleet sit√§ ennen n√§hneet (\\"The railroad, that is a tale of a man and a woman, who had not seen it ever before\\"). Rautatie has also been published as a free audiobook. The Kuopio-Iisalmi part of the Savonia railroad was opened in 1902, and the Lapinlahti railway station was also opened at the time. When Aho was writing his first novel, the railroad part was still being planned.

The mine which led to creation of the town was staked on Christmas Day 1902, prompting the name. During the three decades in which the town's post office operated it was a popular destination for holiday mail seeking a \\"Christmas\\" postmark. The mine is also the location where the minerals apachite, junitoite, and ruizite were first discovered. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.  History  Christmas traces its history to a pair of mining claims in the Dripping Spring Mountains. The first, filed in 1878, was made by Bill Tweed and Dennis O'Brien while the second, filed in 1882, was made by Dr. James Douglas. The claims were invalidated in 1884 when it was determined they were located within the boundaries of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Several years later prospector George B. Chittenden began petitioning the U.S. Congress to modify the reservation's boundaries. An executive order establishing new boundaries for the reservation, and removing the old mining claims from the reservation, was signed by President Teddy Roosevelt on December 22, 1902. Chittenden arraigned for a series of relay riders between the telegraph office in Casa Grande and his camp site just outside the reservation. News of the boundary change arrived late on Christmas Eve prompting Chittenden and his partner, N. H. Mellor, to immediately set out for the old claim sites. The pair staked their claim during the early morning hours and later stated, \\"We filled our stockings and named the place Christmas in honor of the day.\\" The Christmas mine produced of copper, with a value in excess of US$10 million, and limited amounts of silver and gold between 1905 and 1943. Prior to the Panic of 1907, the Christmas mine was operated by the Saddle Mountain Mining Company. Two years after the panic, the mine was reopened by the Gila Copper Sulphide Company. During this time the town of Christmas sprang up near the mine. By 1919 the town boasted a meat market, general store, billiards hall, and two club houses, one for the Hispanic workers and the other for the Whites. The mine fell into receivership in 1921 and was closed. It reopened four years later when the Miner Products Company established a concentration operation capable of processing 500 tons of copper ore per day. The town continued to grow and reached a peak population of roughly 1,000 by the early 1930s. Added amenities included a barbershop, dairy, hat shop, grocery store, school, and a church. Missing were common mining town features such as gambling halls, brothels, and saloons, the town residents tending to avoid both vice and lawlessness. A drop in copper prices however caused the population to shrink to about 100 people by the end of 1931. The town's post office opened on June 17, 1905. Over the next three decades the post office opened and closed several times based upon the fortunes of the mine. It was also difficult keeping a postmaster for the facility as the postmaster's pay was based primarily on the office's stamp sales. During holidays the post office was considerably busier. Christmas cards and other packages were sent from across the United States by people wishing to have their items re-mailed with a Christmas postmark. With the town's declining population making operations unprofitable, the Christmas post office closed for a final time on March 30, 1935. Despite the closure, holiday mail continued to arrive for the next two decades; these bags of mail were forwarded to the nearby post office in Winkelman, Arizona. The Christmas Copper company went bankrupt in 1932 and the mine was sold to a series of different owners before being purchased by the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company in 1955. The United States Bureau of Mines and United States Geological Survey performed exploration diamond drilling at the mine during the 1940s. In December 1956, the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company announced plans to sink a new mine shaft. During the 1960s the mine was converted into an open pit and a number of the town's buildings were either moved or bulldozed to make way for the mine's expanded foot print. In addition to normal mining activities the site was the discovery location for several minerals, including apachite, junitoite, and ruizite. A slump in copper prices forced final closure of the mine in the early 1980s. The mine is now owned by Freeport Mcmoran and is closed to the public.

History  CHDI's predecessor, the High Q Foundation, was established in 2002 by a group of private donors. It was officially incorporated in New Jersey on October 17, 2003.\\"CHDI Foundation, Inc.\\" Business Name Search. New Jersey Division of Revenue & Enterprise Services. Accessed on April 20, 2016. Originally, the High Q foundation aimed to identify targets for treatments, while CHDI - the 'Cure Huntington's Disease Initiative' - was a sister organization allied to the Hereditary Disease Foundation, that focused on developing drugs to hit those targets. 'CHDI', which is officially no longer an abbreviation for anything, now refers to the foundation as a whole. In 2012 CHDI adopted a new logo, depicting a tree composed of interconnected circles. According to Simon Noble, CHDI's Director of Scientific Communication, the logo represents the groundedness of the Foundation, the hereditary nature of HD, the interconnectedness of biological pathways and the medicinal chemistry of drug development.  Funding and direction of HD research  CHDI collaborates with a large number of academic and commercial research groups worldwide. It operates through a \\"virtual\\" biotechnology model, funding third party research organizations as opposed to having a physical research infrastructure of its own. Rather than supplying grants, CHDI enters into research contracts with its collaborators, and exerts a managerial role in addition to providing financial support. In a 2007 Nature news feature, CHDI's then senior scientific advisor Allan Tobin stated, \\"Ninety-five per cent of science works on the principle that the best thing to do is to let good scientists follow their noses ... But this is a different attitude. We think we can direct the science.\\" CHDI's annual spend is unknown, but it is the largest single funder of Huntington's disease research: according to a Nature news feature, it spent $60 million in 2006. The identity of CHDI's donors is not public.

Allelomimetic behavior is sometimes called contagious behavior and has strong components of social facilitation, imitation, and group coordination. It is usually considered to occur between members of the same species. An alternate definition is that allelomimetic behavior is a more intense or more frequent response or the initiation of an already known response, when others around the individual are engaged in the same behavior. It is often referred to as synchronous behavior, mimetic behavior, imitative behavior, and social facilitation. Allelomimetic behavior is displayed in all animals and can occur in any stage of life, but usually starts at a young age. This behavior will continue throughout life, especially when an individual is living in a large group that emphasizes group cohesion. Cohesion is seen as a prerequisite for group living, with synchronous activity being crucial for social cohesion. However, animals in large cohesive groups face trade-offs when allelomimetic behavior is adopted. If the behavior is adopted then the risk of predation or capture decreases significantly but the inter-individual competition for immediate resources, such as food, mates, and space, will increase when cohesion is still stressed. Many collective group decisions in animals are the result of allelomimetism and can be explained by allelomimetic behaviors. Some examples are the cockroaches choosing a single aggregation site, schooling behaviors in fishes, and pheromone-based path selection in ants that allows all the workers to go down the same path to a specific food source. Allelomimetic behavior can also be seen as an animal welfare indicator. For example, if cattle do not have enough room to all lie down simultaneously then it indicates that there are not enough resources present and this can result in lameness of the animals that are forced to stand. Allomimicry is affected by circadian rhythms and circadian cycles of activity within groups which can give the overall appearance of poor animal welfare, if allomimetic behavior were to be used as a welfare indicator then it must be measured several times throughout the course of a day. Most mechanisms involved in performing allelomimetic behavior do not require circadian rhythms to function. Decisions at the individual level are, more often than not, enough to encourage allelomimetism. Patterns of allelomimetic behavior can vary from species to species and can possibly explain other behaviors seen in the animal kingdom. Function Group cohesion: Social animals often benefit by behaving in a similar manner to others within their group. This means that when animals switch behaviors, e.g. from lying to grazing, a degree of synchrony is beneficial. Sometimes this synchrony can be provided by environmental cues, at other times it is provided by the group members themselves. In 1978, Clayton wrote \\"...where environmental stimuli only provide gross synchrony, socially facilitated behaviour will provide finer-scale synchrony, and, what is functionally important, greater cohesion of the social group‚Äô.Clayton, D.A., (1978). Socially facilitated behavior. Quarterly Review of Biology, 53: 373-392  Threats  Synchronous behavior is also threatened when animals in a mixed-sex herd have differing nutritional or physical necessities. This causes group instability which often splits the herd up into two separate groups; generally all male and all female, to recreate the mimetic behavior in a smaller, same-sex group that has more similar needs to the individual. Synchronized, allelomimetic behavior is also affected by many factors, such as age, general group size, sex, space, resource availability, and domestication. Domestication can also be seen as a threat to allelomimetic behavior. The process of domestication removes many threats like predation, food shortages, and competition from many individuals for breeding by providing basically unlimited food and resources while providing protection from outside predators. Domestication may favour less synchronization for animals and provide an adaptation to mimetic behavior to save energy in domesticated animals. Domestication also changes the inter- individual distances between animals and behavioural synchrony in general, both of which are important for anti-predator strategies and responses.  In horses  Allelomimetic behaviour shown in grazing horses. Postural imitation is seen in regards to the stance and position of the legs. Horses, like many animals, learn through imitation of their parents, most often the mother or \\"broodmare\\", or the owner of the foal if the broodmare is not available. If the foal is paired with its mother it will not only mimic the mare's walking style and speed, but it will also mimic the mare's temperament and general behaviors. If a foal was to spend much of its early life around a mare that had an unstable temperament, irrational fears and was difficult to work with then it would grow to be an unstable adult that would develop behavioral abnormalities such as balking. Miller (1996) also adds that behavioral issues can also be removed through allelomimetic processes. Balking is a common behavior in horses and mules that occur from insecurities and fears, and is observed as hesitance with a general fear of moving forward due to the possibility of attack or invasion of their personal space. This behavior can be eliminated if the owner is fearless, looking forward with their head raised high and marching in place. This shows the horse that there is nothing to fear and eventually the horse will mimic the owner's behavior, sync their gate to the owner and follow along. Repeating this behavior as needed will eventually allow the horse to fully incorporate the owner's fearless behavior into its repertoire and prevent balking from reoccurring. Bad habits are also learned through mimicry if the vast majority of the animals present a specific habit.Cribbing is an example of one such habit. If a foal is raised in an environment where this abnormal behavior is performed by the older members of the team, then it will mimic the habit as well, even if the behavior is dangerous to the individual's health. However, the same mimetic behavior that produces these bad habits can help remove them as well. If a broodmare is unable to train her offspring then it falls to the owner to properly train the foal on proper walking gait, speed, and normal behaviors. If the owner spends enough time with their foal keeping a proper stance (ie, an erect, unmoving torso and flexed knees while walking) then the foal will mimic and perform the proper movements for the rest of its life.  In sheep  A herd of sheep spreading out and displaying mimetic foraging behavior Sheep provide a good basis for the evaluation of allelomimetic behavior due to their large group sizes and social behavior. Using them as an experimental subject allows for the determination of the imitative quality and intensity of allelomimetic behavior within a specific herd. Merino sheep, or Ovis aries, are a prey species and a domesticated breed of sheep that require a healthy balance between predator avoidance and foraging space for each individual in the herd. They achieve this balance by spreading out to forage for a period of time then quickly running back to the centre of the herd, creating a fastpacking event. A fastpacking event is specifically when an individual on the outskirts of the herd changes its behavior from grazing to running and moves towards the centre of the herd. Fastpacking events are seen as an adaptive behavior for reducing predation due to the intensity of the response presented in other sheep when one individual is seen running from the outer edges to the centre of the herd. This behavioral change is also referred to as activation/inactivation rates or switching behavior. This change influences other sheep to start running to the centre of the herd until all sheep simultaneously stop in the middle and form a tightly packed herd. The cycle will restart when the herd starts to spread out to forage again. The individual that is displaying the switching behavior from inactivity (grazing in one spot) to activity (running towards the centre of the herd) or vice versa is generally referred to as the herd leader, and other individuals who mimic the switch from inactivity to activity or activity to inactivity are displaying allelomimetic behavior. These activation and inactivation rates are generally more strongly presented in males compared to females and increase as the number of individuals performing an activity increase which is a good indication of imitation present in the herd. For example, if a herd had the majority of individuals active the likelihood of another random individual becoming active increases. The same goes for a herd with a majority of individuals being inactive. In experiments, these events are not specific to a singular spot or caused by any external stimuli that would warrant an alarm response in the sheep. In an experiment performed by Gautrais, members of the same sex more often performed mimetic behavior with each other than when compared to members of a mixed-sex group. Gautrais also focused on behavioral synchrony of activity and inactivity since cohesion of a group involves individuals being active and inactive at the same time rather than syncing every activity to another individual. Even in the absence of other animals, individuals will switch between behaviors that require activity and inactivity (such as digestion, inactivity is good to promote digestion or hunger outweighing the need for rest). Gautrais believes that this physiological need is what prompted the first individual in his herd experiment to switch from activity to inactivity or vice versa and the other members in the herd to follow suit. However, as the number of individuals in a heard decreases, the option to perform mimetic behavior also decreases. This creates a higher rate of spontaneous switching between activity and inactivity-related behaviors. In contrast, the larger the herd is, the more likely it is for mimetic behaviors to occur with spontaneous switching behavior occurring in the \\"herd leader\\", with other members following suit in a brief period of time. This is due to the number of con-specifics present at any given time. If the herd is a small group then there are fewer con- specifics which gives less opportunity for imitation to occur in any given individual and a higher rate of switching from inactivity to activity to inactivity will occur. Two ideas are proposed when the original running individual can recruit others into the running group and the herd as a whole can coordinate when to stop running during these fastpacking events. The first idea is that the initiation and inhibition of the packing event is based on allelomimetic effects in local interactions, and the second idea was that a close enough distance between herd neighbours will stop running behavior. These conclusions stem from an idea about optimization processes in sheep that, at an individual level, allows for the balance of exploring as much space as possible to avoid competition for food and keeping in contact with other herd members to avoid predation and reinforce herd cohesion. These optimization processes can adjust the allelomimetic interaction strengths between individuals to ensure both of the above necessities are met.  In cattle  Social facilitation seen in cattle from all the pictured cattle resting at the same time The synchronous behavior that is displayed in cattle is what is typically thought of when discussing allelomimetic behavior. When the necessary resources for survival, such as food, water, and shelter, are sufficient then cattle will display postural synchrony, lying down or standing while other members of the herd are doing the same. This phenomenon, also referred to as social facilitation, occurs in both free-range cattle that live in pastures, and cattle that live primarily in barns. Social facilitation (or allelomimicry) is the first of two main ideas behind cattle mimicking each other's behavior until the herd acts synchronously, whether it be lying down, standing, or grazing together. According to Stoye and Porter, one member of the herd will alter its behavior (ie. standing to lying down or vice versa) and its nearest neighbor will mimic the behavior, this behavior will travel across the herd until all members are performing one action. Stoye and Porter also noted that it was more likely for a cow to display the same behavior as its nearest neighbor compared to a randomly selected cow from the herd. This behavior continues despite the appearance of free will of an individual to graze/stand or lie down, even when the herd is stationary. The second idea behind synchronized behavior is called concurrent or combined response. This dictates that the collective behavior is a mere coincidence of each individual animal's decision to change their behavior based on external (the discovery of food) or internal (exhaustion, the need for rest/food, or similar daily schedules as other members) factors. A human example of a concurrent behavior is rush hour, many people are driving at the same time due to having a similar schedule to others, not because others are already driving and they decide to as well. Previous studies have identified artificial synchronization of (dairy) cattle behavior because of consistent milking and feeding times. This creates a similar daily schedule for all the cattle to follow, which in turn creates collective behavior between all members during these specific milking and feeding times. According to Stoye and Porter, cattle were most synchronous at night, least synchronous during the afternoon, and intermediately synchronous in the morning. This could be due to all the cattle being milked at similar times in the morning and feeding at similar times during the night, but having no \\"scheduled activity\\" to perform during the afternoon.  In dogs   Feeding habits  Dogs mimicking feeding behaviors in the presence of another hungry litter-mate Dogs are one of the most common species to produce allelomimetic behavior and have it go noticed by humans. Studies have been conducted across several breeds of dog regarding eating habits and stress vocalization when alone or with litter-mates. Many results have shown that most dogs will eat more when they are in large groups compared to when they eat alone. This has been coined as the \\"social facilitation of eating\\" and is not specific to certain breeds. In a study conducted by Compton and Scott, 80% of the dogs studied ate more in groups on the majority of trials and the overall group consumption together was larger than the summation of food consumption between each dog eating individually. When pups were considered food-satiated (would not eat more food even with a dish in front of them), they would resume eating when a hungry litter-mate was introduced into the room with them. It was believed that since everything other than the addition of the hungry litter-mate was held constant, the increased appetite in the food-satiated pup was caused by the presence of the hungry pup and allelomimetic behavior. The allelomimetic behavior that occurs in dogs develops directly from experiences that occur during the critical period of development. Scott's proposed theory of social motivation and the theory of the social facilitation of eating rely heavily on the allelomimetic behavioral system that occurs in these animals.  Isolation and vocalization responses  Isolation is a large stressor for many dogs and can result in separation anxiety if they are left alone from others for extended lengths of time during a critical period in their development. If a puppy is separated from their litter-mates, home pen, or owners during a critical period it will produce an intense negative emotional reaction and the reaction will subside when they return to their litter-mates, home pen, or owners. This reaction is a natural conditioned learning paradigm that will have to be constantly repeated during their infancy to remove the intensity of the response. When housed with other litter-mates the individual will be strongly motivated to mimic the behavior of the animals around it. Introducing other litter-mates who do not experience a severe negative emotion to isolation is one of the ways to avoid negative reactions to isolation in the individual in question. This provides a base for mimetic behavior to occur and the pup experiencing severe negative emotions will begin to mimic the behavior of the litter-mates and adopt their neutral behavior. Scott and Bronson replicated a study originally conducted by Fredericson in 1952 about vocalization rates of beagle puppies when confined in a box alone or with a companion. Fredericson found that 75% of puppies would vocalize significantly less when confined with another puppy compared to alone, a result that was replicated and confirmed by Scott and Bronson in 1971. Many dogs were more distressed when they were placed alone in an unfamiliar environment compared to a known environment, or an unfamiliar environment with litter-mates. This increase in calm behavior when multiple litter-mates are in an unfamiliar environment is caused by allelomimetic behavior. If one pup is calm, many dogs will mimic that behavior, creating a litter of relaxed dogs. Likewise, if there is one distressed pup, many dogs could also mimic the distressed behavior but the former is more common among experiments.  In chickens and roosters  The domesticated white leghorn rooster, a species of rooster used in Eklund and Jensen's experiment The wild red junglefowl, an ancestral species used in Eklund and Jensen's experiment Allelomimetic behaviour can often be affected by domestication and lead to the evolution of new social behaviours, or subtle changes in current social behaviors. It is thought that domestication would reduce the level of allelomimetic behavior in animals due to the removal of many important factors that create mimicries such as predation, food pressures and competition between species members. Since there is no need to worry about possible predation or a lack of resources in a domesticated environment, the allelomimetic behaviors seen in non-domesticated species evolved out and the adaptation to domestication became the new normal. Mimetic behaviors that once incorporated anti-predator strategies or mating strategies became unnecessary and the use of these behaviors decreased. An experiment was conducted by Eklund and Jensen using an ancestor of all domesticated chickens, the red junglefowl, and a domesticated breed, the white leghorn. They showed that allelomimetic behavior was more prominent and used more frequently in the non- domesticated red junglefowl compared to the white leghorn, most likely due to the chance of predation, starvation, and the lack of shelter playing a role in producing these allelomimetic behaviors. Total synchronization only occurred in both species during comforting behaviors such as perching and dust bathing. In activities outside of comfort behavior, there was little mimetic behavior in the domesticated white leghorn and inter-individual distances presented by the chickens during perching was larger than the non-domesticated species. Perching in the red junglefowl occurred more frequently and was more mimetic than in the white leghorn. The social behavior of the red junglefowl was also affected by allelomimetism, where behaviors such as feather pecking were more synchronized than in the white leghorn. A difference in feeding synchrony also appeared in females versus males. Females were more likely to mimic other females' eating behaviors compared to a mixed-sex group or males mimicking males.

It is also known as the Glencorse Branch of the North British Railway. It opened from a junction at Millerhill on the Waverley Route, to Roslin in 1874 and was extended to a location near Penicuik to serve Glencorse Barracks and a colliery in 1877 and to Penicuik Gas Works in 1878. Bus services substantially eroded the passenger carryings on the line, and passenger trains ceased in 1933. There was some revival in colliery activity after World War II but most of the traffic had ceased in 1969 and the line finally closed completely in 1989. History First proposals System map of the Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin RailwayMany Scottish railways were authorised in the frenzy of schemes in Parliament in the 1845 session, including the Caledonian Railway; the North British Railway had been authorised the previous year. Earlier there had been a heated debate about the route a line from central Scotland to England ought to take; it was assumed that only one line could be supported commercially, and many communities, seeing the benefit to towns already on a railway line, were extremely anxious to be on the new main line. In the event the limitation to a single main line was cast aside. During the debate, Peebles had been placed on one of the routes, but that scheme fell out of favour, and in November 1845 a Peebles Railway was proposed, for the 1846 Parliamentary session, connecting Edinburgh and Peebles. It would have run by way of Loanhead, Roslin and Glencorse, running to Penicuik and crossing the North Esk, and on to Peebles. The scheme failed to attract support and was not proceeded with. Peebles got its railway later: the Peebles Railway opened in 1855. It branched from the North British Railway main line to Hawick, which became known as the Waverley Route. That line and the Peebles branch line from it ran well to the east of the North Esk, and although there was a \\"Penicuik\\" station it did not properly serve the industrial communities of the earlier proposal. The North British Railway constantly wished to consolidate its dominance of the Lothians area, and to keep the rival Caledonian Railway out, and in 1865 it succeeded in getting authority for several branches, and two roads, in the area, under the North British Railway (Lasswade &c.; Branches) Act 1865. However, in the following months there was a major upheaval in the NBR board due to shareholder dissatisfaction, and none of the \\"Lasswade\\" railways was built. The Edinburgh Loanhead and Roslin Railway Mineral extraction developed increasingly in the ground to the north of Penicuik, and this led to a proposed railway serving the district; the Edinburgh Loanhead and Roslin Railway Act authorising the line, obtained the Royal Assent on 20 June 1870.Awdry, Thomas (NBR volume 1), Carter and Munro; Ross says 26 June 1870. the capital was ¬£54,000. Agreement had been reached with the North British Railway to work the line for thirty years for 45% of gross receipts, and a clause allowed the NBR to purchase the concern within five years of opening. Thomas Bouch was the engineer and the contractor was John Waddell. Unprecedented wet weather delayed the construction of the line. While the work was proceeding, the North British Railway informed the Loanhead and Roslin company that the latter would have to pay for the junction with the NBR line at Millerhill. This became a heated dispute, but eventually agreement was reached, in May 1872: the NBR paid one third of the cost. During this period it was evident that further mineral extraction was developing, and a special meeting of shareholders on 5 February 1872 approved the submission of a Bill to extend the line to Glencorse and Mauricewood. The Shotts Iron Company had promised to send 50,000 to 60,000 tons of ironstone annually on the branch and the Glasgow Iron Company was sinking new pits in the district. The Glencorse Extension Act was passed on 5 August 1872 with capital of ¬£36,000.Hurst; Carter says 5 August 1873. The Shotts Iron Company pit at Mauricewood was on high ground and was reached from the railway branch by a tramway on an inclined plane. Opening the line The line opened for mineral traffic as far as the Shotts sidings at Loanhead on 6 November 1873; the Shotts Iron Company was the principal customer; traffic was exchanged at Millerhill Junction. Completion of the line as far as Roslin was expected to be ready by end of May, but there were difficulties completing the bridge over Bilston Glen. It was not until 22 July 1874 that Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade made a formal inspection; there were some qualifications in his report, in particular over the method of working, but sanction was later given by letter, on 1 August 1874, after the Company gave written undertakings about the signalling arrangements, and the section from Loanhead to Roslin may have opened on 23 July 1874.Quick states persuasively that the line was intended to open on that date, but that due to the refusal to approve the working until the letter of 1 August, that the date of opening was a day or so after that. Extending to Glencorse By this time two other short branches had opened in the area: the Esk Valley Railway had opened in 1867, and the Penicuik Railway followed in 1872. In 1875, the Shotts Iron Company sunk a new shaft at Greenlaw near Glencorse Barracks, and (encouraged by the NBR) the ELRR sought Parliamentary authority to extend the line to serve the mine. This was opposed bitterly by the Penicuik Railway, who saw it as an encroachment.The Penicuik line was close by the intended ELRR extension, but further from Greenlaw. The Penicuik Company no doubt contemplated a branch line extension. They also feared that the ELRR extension would abstract business from Penicuik itself. Finally the two companies agreed to pool all traffic south of Auchendinny on the Penicuik line and all traffic south of Roslin on the ELRR. In any case the extension to Glencorse was not proceeded with at once due to the Company's capital not being fully subscribed; in 1875 the NBR was persuaded to subscribe ¬£6,000 of the required ¬£36,000. In fact the shortage of capital forced the Company to proceed with the amalgamation with the NBR; the Royal Assent for the amalgamation was given on 28 June 1877, taking effect on 1 August 1877.From Hurst, Thomas (Forgotten Railways, and NBR volume 1), Carter and Awdry; Ross says 31 July 1877; Munro, generally meticulous, states that the amalgamation took effect on 31 July 1878. ELRR shareholders got preference 5% shares after the first year; a good bargain as their own railway had only paid 2%. Construction of the extension to Glencorse was heavily delayed due to problems with the embankments. On 16 May 1877 Major General Hutchinson inspected the extension, and criticised the absence of block instruments for signalling trains; there had been no decision by the Company on the method of working, and an undertaking was required from the NBR (as intended purchasers of the line) as well as from the Loanhead and Roslin Company. A re-inspection of the line took place on 25 June, and the opening to passenger traffic was then approved on 28 June 1877. The line opened on 2 July 1877, to a \\"Glencross\\" station opposite the Glencorse Barracks. The station was later renamed Glencorse.Thomas (Forgotten Railways) states that the station was first known as Greenlaw Barracks, apparently in 1877, but by then the Barracks was known as Glencorse and this must be an error. There were five passenger trains daily, with first second and fourth class available. There was a self- acting incline running from Greenlaw Colliery to Glencorse station. The line was soon further extended the short distance to Penicuik Gas Works on 30 June 1878. The Greenlaw colliery tramway was transferred a short distance to the west, bringing the coal from Mauricewood Colliery (a new shaft connected to the Greenlaw workings) to the main line nearer the Gas Works end of the line; this took place some time between 1878 and 1894. Bilston Viaduct In the late 1880s the mansion house of Drydenbank, near Bilston Glen Viaduct, collapsed, having been undermined by coal working. Investigation disclosed that coal workings were moving towards the railway viaduct, and would certainly disrupt it. Negotiation with the colliery owner resulted in a demand for ¬£152,500. The NBR sought powers to replace the viaduct with an embankment, but this was objected to by landowner, and after arbitration by the Board of Trade found that coal reservation of ¬£25,000 would suffice to protect the viaduct, and the NBR was obliged to accept that. Eventually the NBR replaced the viaduct in 1892. The twentieth century The first bus service from Roslin to Edinburgh started in 1914, immediately affecting passenger carryings on the line. During World War I Gilmerton station was closed from 1 January 1917, being reopened on 2 June 1919. The railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" in 1923 following the Railways Act 1921, and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In the 1930s competition from local bus services intensified considerably and the railway passenger traffic declined steeply, resulting in the passenger service on the line closing on 1 May 1933. The railways were again reorganised by government on nationalisation in 1948; the area was now part of the Scottish Region of British Railways. A new pit at Bilston Glen opened in 1952 as an extension of the Burghlee Colliery (and of the branch to it), and mineral traffic flows on the branch increased considerably. However Penicuik gasworks closed in 1956, removing the last regular traffic from the extension. At that time, the line was cut back to a point immediately south of Glencorse station, to continue to serve the Barracks, but the line was again shortened to Roslin from 31 August 1959, and only mineral traffic continued on the branch, the ordinary goods facilities at Gilmerton, Roslin and Glencorse being withdrawn. However, as late as the summer of 1960, passenger excursion trains used the line. Bilston Glen Colliery opened in April 1961; at the time this was a modern show-piece for the National Coal Board, and further mineral traffic was brought to the line. Roslin colliery closed in January 1969 and the line was abandoned from the north end of Bilston viaduct southwards. The line closed completely in 1989, except for a headshunt at Millerhill Junction. Topography The line climbed from Millerhill Junction on a steep gradient of 1 in 55. Bilston Glen was crossed by a viaduct 166 feet long and 150 feet high; wrought iron truss girders were supported on brick piers. The line was opened to passenger trains as far as Roslin in early August 1874, and to Glencross on 2 July 1877; it closed to passenger trains on 1 May 1933. Locations on the line were: * Millerhill; junction station on the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway; * Gilmerton; closed except for workmen's trains 1 January 1917; fully reopened 2 June 1919; * Shotts Sidings (Ramsey Pit); * Loanhead; * Shotts sidings (Burghlee Pit); * Roslin station; * Glencross; later renamed Glencorse; * Mauricewood Colliery Sidings; * Penicuik Gas Works.

He served as the moderator of the 1992 vice presidential debate between Dan Quayle, Al Gore, and James Stockdale. Biography Early life Hal Bruno was born in Chicago, Illinois, on October 25, 1928. His father sold housewares for a living. He became a volunteer firefighter during the 1940s. Bruno earned his bachelor's degree in 1950 from the University of Illinois, where he worked as a sportswriter for the university's newspaper, The Daily Illini, alongside Shel Silverstein, Bud Karmin, Gene Shalit, Hugh Hough and Robert Novak. He also worked for the Champaign News Gazette during weekends while in college. He served in the Korean War as an Army intelligence officer. Bruno then earned a Fulbright scholarship to study in India after the war. He married his wife, Margaret \\"Meg\\" Christian Bruno, on November 12, 1959. Career Bruno launched his professional career as a reporter for Chicago area newspapers and news agencies. His first job after his graduation was for Advertising Age before becoming the sports editor of the Daily Chronicle. He temporarily left his profession in order to serve in the Korean War. Bruno returned to Chicago after the war and joined the staff of the Chicago City News Bureau as a police reporter. He joined The Chicago American in 1954 In 1956, Bruno earned a Fulbright Scholarship in India to study Indian media. He worked as a South Asian correspondent for the International News Service while in India. Bruno covered some of the biggest news stories of the 1950s, including the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Our Lady of the Angels School fire in 1958, and the Cuban revolution in 1959. He joined the staff of Newsweek magazine in 1960. Bruno worked as a reporter, foreign correspondent, news editor and chief political correspondent for Newsweek for 18 years. One of his first assignments at the magazine was the 1960 president election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. His foreign reports included the 1962 Sino-Indian War. He rose to become Newsweek's Chicago bureau chief and later the magazine's political editor in Washington D.C. ABC News Bruno joined ABC News in 1978 after leaving Newsweek. He oversaw ABC News' election and political coverage during the 1980s and 1990s. Ken Rudin, the current political editor of NPR who worked as Bruno's deputy at ABC News, described Bruno as \\"...the eyes and ears for Peter (Jennings) and 'World News Tonight' and (Ted) Koppel.\\" As political director, Bruno packaged much of the political headlines presented by ABC's best known reporters, including Ted Koppel, Cokie Roberts, Sam Donaldson, and Peter Jennings. Colleagues, such as Donaldson, have described Bruno as personally knowing nearly every major party county chairman in the United States. While much of his work at ABC took place off-screen, Bruno was invited onto news and talk shows owing to his political expertise. Bruno also hosted the weekly radio show, Hal Bruno's Washington, on ABC Radio until 1999. Bruno received public attention as the moderator of the 1992 vice presidential debate in Atlanta on October 13, 1992. The debate took place between incumbent Republican Vice President Dan Quayle, Democrat Al Gore, and Independent retired Vice Admiral James B. Stockdale, who was the running mate of Ross Perot. The debate would become known for unusual responses and negative rhetoric from the candidates and the audience. It would later be called \\"the most combative debate in the 32-year history of the televised forums\\" by the Washington Post. One of the most memorable moments from the debate came early in the night. Bruno, in his capacity as debate moderator, asked James Stockdale, \\"Admiral Stockdale, your opening statement, please, sir?\\" Stockdale famously replied to Bruno's request: \\"Who am I? Why am I here?\\" Bruno also scolded the debate's audience when they jeered candidates Quayle and Gore, saying, \\"There‚Äôs no call for that ... so knock that off.\\" He retired from ABC in 1999 to become the chairman of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. Firefighting Bruno said that his interest in firefighting began \\"after riding as a kid on fire trucks in Chicago.\\" Bruno originally became a volunteer firefighter during the 1940s and remained in firefighting for more than 60 years. He served as the chairman of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation from 1999 to 2008 and remained Chairman Emeritus after retiring from the post. He combined his background in journalism and firefighting as a monthly columnist for Firehouse Magazine. Bruno called in coverage of the attack on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. He was one of the first rescue workers to respond to the Pentagon attack and remained on site for hours. Later life Bruno was inducted into the Society of Professional Journalists Hall of Fame in 2008. Bruno died at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, November 8, 2011, of heart arrhythmia caused by a fall at the age of 83. He was survived by his wife of nearly 56 years, Margaret; two sons, Harold R. Bruno III and Daniel Bruno; his sister, Barbara; and four grandchildren. Bruno and his wife were residents of Chevy Chase, Maryland.

He converted, in 1590, from Lutheranism to the Roman Catholic confession, causing some political turmoil.  Life  James was the second son of Margrave Charles II of Baden-Durlach and Anna of Veldenz, daughter of the Count Palatine Rupert of Veldenz. From 1557, James and his brother Ernest Frederick were educated at the court of their guardian, the Lutheran Duke Louis III \\"the Pious\\" of W√ºrttemberg. James was very interested in recent developments in science and studied in T√ºbingen and Strasbourg. He then made a Grand Tour to Italy and France.  Regency, 1577-1584  When his father died in 1577, James was a minor when he inherited the Margraviate of Baden-Hachberg. Thus, the margraviate was taken up by a regency council, consisting of his mother, Anna of Veldenz, Elector Palatine Louis VI (until 1583), Count Palatine Philip Louis of Neuburg and Duke Louis III \\"the Pious\\" of W√ºrttemberg.  Division of the territory  James and his eldest brother Ernest Frederick wanted to be sovereign rulers of their own fragment of Baden. Their father's last will and testament forbade a further division of the margraviate. However, the testament had not been properly signed and sealed. According to the three remaining regents, this invalidated the testament, so they allowed a division, thereby fragmenting Baden beyond the existing division into Baden-Baden and Baden-Durlach. James received the Lordship of Hachberg, with its seat in Emmendingen.Baumann, p. 21-22 Ernest Frederick received Lower Baden, including the two largest cities, Durlach and Pforzheim. Their youngest brother George Frederick received Upper Baden, including the Lordships of R√∂tteln and Badenweiler and the Margraviate of Baden-Sausenburg. When James's heir died in 1591, Baden-Hachberg fell to Ernest Frederick. When Ernest Frederick died without a male heir in 1604, his possessions also fell to George Frederick, thereby reuniting Baden-Durlach.  The conversion  The three brothers followed different paths in their religious development. All three were raised in the Lutheran faith. George Frederick converted to Calvinism, James converted to Catholicism, Ernest Frederick remained a Lutheran. In 1582, the conversion of Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the Archbishop of Cologne to Lutheranism led to a war between Gebhard, who refused to give up his Archdiocese and Duke Ernest of Bavaria, who had been elected as his successor. Gebhard tried to convert the archdiocese to Lutheranism and allied himself with the beautiful Countess Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben. James fought in this war under the Spanish general Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. He later served under the Catholic Duke Charles III of Lorraine. In 1582, at the age of 22, Margrave James III of Baden married the 16-year-old Countess Elisabeth of Culemborg-Pallandt. She was the sole heiress to a very large fortune. Their marriage was a happy one and produced four children. However, it lasted only six years. In 1588, the couple moved from the Hochburg to the smaller Emendingen Castle. On 1 January 1590, James III gave city rights to the market town of Emmendingen. During this period of deep religious division, the Margrave closely watched the three Christian camps: the Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists. In 1589 and 1590, he commissioned two colloquia, the first in Baden-Baden, the second in Emmendingen, between Lutheran theologicians from W√ºrttemberg and Catholics. In Emmendingen, the Lutheran side was led by Johannes Pappus from Strasbourg, and the Catholic side by James's court chaplain Johannes Zehender. Afterwards, James converted, like his lead councillor Johann Pistorius had done two years earlier, in the Cistercian monastery Tennenbach on 15 July 1590 to the Roman Catholic faith. This caused a huge stir in Germany, as he was the first reigning Protestant prince in Germany to convert after the 1555 Peace of Augsburg. Under the rule in that treaty, Catholicism was made the state religion of the Margraviate of Baden- Hachberg on 10 August 1590. Pope Sixtus V had high hopes for the Margrave.  Death  However, only a week later, the healthy, 28-year-old Margrave James III died unexpectedly. His body was dissected by two professors of the Medical Faculty of Freiburg -- a very rare procedure in the 16th Century. The precise Latin language of the autopsy report states that the cause of death was poisoning by arsenic (As2O3). James's will stated that he wished to be buried in Baden-Baden, which was Catholic at the time. He was, however, buried in the St. Michael church in Pforzheim. The inscription on his grave does not mention his conversion to Catholicism.Double epitaph of the Margraves James III and Ernest Frederick of Baden-Durlach in the castle church in Pforzheim; James III's epitaph is on the right A week after James's death, his widow, Elisabeth of Culemborg-Pallandt, gave birth to a posthumous son and heir Ernest James. Ernest Frederick illegally took the baby in his care. The baby died after less than nine months, on 29 May 1591. Baden-Hachberg fell to Ernest Frederick, who converted it back to Lutheranism. Elisabeth of Culemborg-Pallandt converted to Catholicism after her husband died. Ernest Frederick then refused to give her the widow seat in Emmendingen, to which she was entitled under James's testament. The events surrounding James III's death illustrate the increasing polarization in religious matters. The tensions between the faiths had risen very high, and the hunger for power of the German rulers and princelings was very strong. In less than 30 years, these tensions would be discharged in a terrible manner during the Thirty Years' War.  Marriage and issue  Margrave James III of Baden and Hachberg James married on 6 September 1584 with Elisabeth of Culemborg-Pallandt (born: 1567; died: 8 May 1620), the daughter of Count Floris I of Pallandt-Culemborg (1537‚Äì1598 ).

Alternatively, the property of microcontinuity at c can be expressed by stating that the composition \\\\text{st}\\\\circ f is constant of the halo of c, where \\"st\\" is the standard part function.

However, Bolzano's work was not noticed by the larger mathematical community until its rediscovery in Heine in the 1860s. Meanwhile, Cauchy's textbook Cours d'Analyse defined continuity in 1821 using infinitesimals as above.. Continuity and uniform continuity The property of microcontinuity is typically applied to the natural extension f* of a real function f. Thus, f defined on a real interval I is continuous if and only if f* is microcontinuous at every point of I. Meanwhile, f is uniformly continuous on I if and only if f* is microcontinuous at every point (standard and nonstandard) of the natural extension I* of its domain I (see Davis, 1977, p. 96). Example 1 The real function f(x)=\\\\tfrac{1}{x} on the open interval (0,1) is not uniformly continuous because the natural extension f* of f fails to be microcontinuous at an infinitesimal a>0. Indeed, for such an a, the values a and 2a are infinitely close, but the values of f*, namely \\\\tfrac{1}{a} and \\\\tfrac{1}{2a} are not infinitely close. Example 2 The function f(x)=x^2 on \\\\mathbb{R} is not uniformly continuous because f* fails to be microcontinuous at an infinite point H\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^*. Namely, setting e=\\\\tfrac{1}{H} and K = H + e, one easily sees that H and K are infinitely close but f*(H) and f*(K) are not infinitely close. Uniform convergence Uniform convergence similarly admits a simplified definition in a hyperreal setting. Thus, a sequence f_n converges to f uniformly if for all x in the domain of f* and all infinite n, f_n^*(x) is infinitely close to f^*(x).

He currently plays for Colegio Nacional de Iquitos in the Peruvian First Division. Club career  Early career  Nicol√°s developed as a footballer in C.D. Universidad Nacional de la Amazon√≠a Peruana (Deportivo UNAP). There he played in the District League of Iquitos. Then in 2005 he joined Iquito's biggest club Colegio Nacional de Iquitos for the 2005 Copa Per√∫, which they were eliminated from in the Round of 16 by Ol√≠mpico Somos Per√∫ 3-3 on aggregate. FBC Melgar Then in 2006 Celis would have a very short stint playing for Peruvian First Division club FBC Melgar, Arequipa's most popular club. Celis made his official debut in the Peruvian First Division with FBC Melgar on March 12, 2006 in the 2006 season. He came on in the 77th minute for Jos√© Carlos Fern√°ndez, and his club went on to defeat Uni√≥n Huaral 3-1 at home. His manager at the time Teddy Cardama allowed Nicol√°s to play the following match, away to Sporting Cristal. He entered the match replacing Jos√© Carlos Fern√°ndez in the 80th minute, but his club still lost 3-0. This would be his last appearance for FBC Melgar. Asociaci√≥n Deportiva Hospital Then he in 2007 he joined Pucallpa based club Asociaci√≥n Deportiva Hospital, which was playing in the Copa Per√∫ division at the time. In the 2007 Copa Per√∫ season, his club managed to make it all the way to the semifinals. There they were eliminated by the eventual champions that season, Club Juan Aurich, 3-1 on aggregate. Return to Colegio Nacional Iquitos Then in 2008 he returned to Colegio Nacional de Iquitos and helped them reach promotion at the end of the 2008 Copa Per√∫ season. Celis played a part in the last three defining matches for promotion to the Peruvian First Division. They eventually finished one point behind the champions Sport Huancayo but were still granted promotion. Celis made his Peruvian First Division debut in Colegio Nacional de Iquitos colors in Round 1 of the 2009 Torneo Descentralizado season at home against Sporting Cristal. He was in the starting line-up and then was substituted by Andrei Re√°tegui in the 71st minute of the match, which finished in a scoreless draw.

She spent a post-doctoral year at the University of Oxford in 1975/76 with Jerome Bruner, specializing in the social interactionist theory of language acquisition. Ninio was appointed a lecturer in Psychology at the Hebrew University in 1976, was promoted to senior lecturer in 1982, to associate professor in 1989, and to full professor in 1994. She holds the endowed chair of Joseph H. and Belle R. Braun Professor in Psychology at Hebrew University. She served in various administrative capacities at the Hebrew University, among them as the Chair of the Graduate Developmental Program, Chair of the Department of Psychology, Chair of the Sturman Human Development Center, and Director of the Martin and Vivian Levin Center for the Normal and Psychopathological Development of the Child and Adolescent. She also served as a visiting professor at Duke University, New York University, the New School for Social Research, New York, the University of Quebec at Montreal, Harvard University, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and at the University of Pennsylvania. She is a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association for the Study of Child Language (IASCL). Ninio also published 2 Hebrew language poetry books, one under the pseudonym 'Ada Shimon. Joint picture-book reading of parents and young children With Jerome Bruner and others, Ninio identified joint picture-book reading of parents and young children as an important early context for the acquisition of vocabulary and literacy skills, and described the processes of parental ‚Äúscaffolding‚Äù that facilitate learning in this context.Ninio, A.

The taxonomy was built on the theoretical writings of Speech Act theorists such as John Searle and sociologists such as Erving Goffman, as well as on mothers' descriptions of videotaped interaction sessions in which they had participated.A detailed description of the sources for the taxonomy and of the various versions of it can be found in: Ninio, A. (1991, April).Introduction to the Ninio and Wheeler taxonomy of verbal communicative acts and to the INCA abridged version. Paper presented at the Biennial Meeting of the Society for Research in Child Development, Seattle, Washington, April, 1991. An abridged version of it (Inventory of Communicative Acts-Abridged, INCA-A), was prepared by Ninio for use by Catherine Snow, Barbara Pan, and colleagues at Harvard University in the research project ‚ÄúFoundations for Language Assessment in Spontaneous Speech‚Äù funded by the National Institutes of Health. The abridged version has been adopted as the official communicative coding system of the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) project.MacWhinney, B. (2000). The CHILDES project: Tools for analyzing talk, Vol 1: Transcription format and programs (3rd ed.). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. pp. 99-102. See also the online manual. INCA-A has the same speech act codes but a less detailed repertoire of talk interchange codes than the full Ninio and Wheeler version. Both versions of the Ninio and Wheeler system are widely used in projects on English as well as Hebrew, Dutch, German, Irish, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Romanian, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and others. They are also used in research involving young adults, second language learners, peer conversations, children in the Head Start program, aphasics, autistic children, visually impaired children, and more. Syntactic development Unexpectedly for an empiricist who emphasizes learning and the interactive context of acquisition, Ninio uses as her linguistic framework Chomsky's Minimalist Program alongside the formally analogous Dependency Grammar. The appeal to the binary combining operation Merge (or Dependency) and the use of grammatical relations as atomic units of analysis makes her work on syntactic development unusual in the field where many researchers prefer such holistic approaches as Construction Grammar, or else forsake linguistically oriented analyses in favor of statistical patterns to be found by automatic means. In her empirical work, Ninio employs the methods of corpus-based linguistics in order to characterize child-directed speech and young children's early multiword productions. In her study of the acquisition of the core grammatical relations of English, her research team constructed a 1.5 million words strong parental corpus and a 200,000 words strong child corpus, parsing them manually for the relevant syntactic relations. In describing the development of language in children, Ninio adopts the concepts and methods of Complexity Science describing the process of acquisition as one in which young children join a complex network of speakers and speech as new participants in the network. In this theoretical model, children are likened to new users of the World-Wide Web who both use the WWW and also create it with their own productions The pragmatic uses of speech for communication among speakers are thus viewed not only as the background and context of acquisition but also as building blocks of connectivity in the complex system which is language.

The pattern of the fallacy is often as such: \\"If A is the set of c and d, and B is the set of d and e, then since they both contain d, A and B are equal\\". d is not required to exist in both sets; only a passing similarity is required to cause this fallacy to be used. False equivalence arguments are often used in journalism and in politics, where flaws of one politician may be compared to flaws of a wholly different nature of another. Examples The following statements are examples of false equivalence: * \\"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is no more harmful than when your neighbor drips some oil on the ground when changing his car's oil.\\" :The comparison is between things differing by many orders of magnitude: Deepwater Horizon spilled of oil; one's neighbor might spill perhaps . * \\"They're both living animals that metabolize chemical energy. Therefore there's little difference between having a pet cat and a pet snail.\\" :The \\"equivalence\\" is in factors that are not relevant to the animals' suitability as pets.

It contains a single species, Unescoceratops koppelhusae. Discovery Unescoceratops is known only from the holotype specimen TMP 95.12.6, a partial left dentary. The fossil was collected in 1995 in the Black Coulee locality (formerly Deadhorse Coulee), near the Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, from the Dinosaur Park Formation, dating to the late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 76.5-75 million years ago. The specimen was regarded as too incomplete to identify, and was shelved for several years. It was believed to be a Leptoceratops specimen at the time. A cladistic analysis done by Michael Ryan (of The Cleveland Museum of Natural History) and David Evans (of the Royal Ontario Museum) found it to be among the most advanced leptoceratopsid genera. Description Unescoceratops is thought to have been between one and two meters long and less than 91 kilograms. Its teeth were the roundest of all leptoceratopsids. Mallon et al. (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent of Laramidia, during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that small ornithischians like Unescoceratops were generally restricted to feeding on vegetation at, or below the height of 1 meter. Etymology The genus Unescoceratops was first described by Michael J. Ryan, David C. Evans, Philip J. Currie, Caleb M. Brown and Don Brinkman in 2012 (though it had been published earlier by Ryan and Currie in 1995 with no name) and the type species is Unescoceratops koppelhusae. The name means \\"UNESCO's ceratopsian\\" (ceratopsian means \\"one with a horned face\\"). The name is meant to honor UNESCO's efforts to increase understanding of natural history sites around the world. \\"Dinosaurprovincialparkaceratops was too long,\\" explained Ryan.

The site now lies under the Walter F. George Reservoir, which is a part of the Chattahoochee River basin. History The first occupations of the site were a village settlement during the Deptford period. Occupation of the site and the construction of two mounds continue into the Middle Woodland period. Ceramic evidence also dates occupation to the Early Swift Creek culture. The final layer of Mound A indicates it was converted to a platform mound typical of the Mississippian period. Excavations The site was first visited by Clarence B. Moore at the turn of the century. He tested the site but did not conduct any excavations due to negative results. The site was visited by a field party from the University of Georgia in 1950. Some minor surface excavations were conducted. Thorough excavations on the site were conducted during 1959-1960 by Arthur Kelly, James H. Kellar and Edward V. McMichael before construction of the dam. The site is no longer accessible for excavation. Site description The site contains 2 mounds, a flat top mound (Mound A), and one large dome shaped burial mound (Mound B). Mound A is about by and about in height. Mound B is about by . There is also a village situated between the two mounds approximately in area. A pre-mound village occupation, dated to the Deptford period exists beneath Mound A. Evidence for small circular houses and pits were found dated to this time. The first layers of Mound construction are attributed to the Late Deptford Period, with subsequent cultures building upon the original. The site was abandoned during the Woodland Period and re- inhabited about 500 years later during the Mississippian Period. Artifacts The most significant artifacts at the Mandeville site consist of ceramics, including vessels and potsherds. Bone tools and projectile points were also found, along with flake knives. Fragments from a ceramic figurine were found, including the head and two torso fragments.

Work with the Dorchester Company Bushrod became a haberdasher at Dorchester and was also a merchant adventurer carrying on a trade in fishing for cod and bartering furs from New England which he sold in England and France. He was a parishioner of Rev. John White who was influential in colonising New England and he was a strong supporter of the puritan movement. He was persuaded by White that a colony could established from the men employed to double man his ships for fishing purposes and they formed a plan to leave them on the coast to grow crops and live off the land so they could rejoin the fishing fleet next season. White thought this could become a larger colony and a refuge for those suffering religious persecution. Bushrod and White formed the Dorchester Company together with other friends and traders. Bushrod acted as the company's representative in applying for a patent to settle a plantation in New England which was granted by the Council for New England on 18 February 1623.Michal Russell Richard Bushrod (1576-1628) Later life Bushrode became a man of substance in Dorchester owning properties in various parts of Dorset.

It is thought to have existed in 1170 although Charles Heath in 1800 reported evidence of earlier Saxon design in the shape of the architecture. Both St Thomas' and the nearby Monnow Bridge were damaged by fire in the Battle of Monmouth in 1233, part of the series of uprisings against Henry III by his barons.

That on the south wall has a pillar base with scrollwork and a bowl with images of the faces of a man and a woman, pelicans and a serpent in a Garden of Eden theme. Scholarship as to its date has developed. Until the late 20th century, it was generally considered to be an unusually well preserved example of a 12th-century font. John Guy and Ewart Smith, in their 1979 study, Ancient Gwent Churches, describe it as \\"very ancient\\",. This dating echoes E. T. Davies, who suggests, in his 1977 booklet, The Ancient Churches of Gwent, that the styling of the pillar indicates that the font \\"goes back to the end of the eleventh century\\". The church itself labels the font as \\"early\\". However, Davies noted that the pillar and bowl may be of different periods and suggested that \\"expert examination may modify this conclusion\\". John Newman, in his 2000 Pevsner Gwent/Monmouthshire, does just that, recording the wooden conical cover as \\"clearly of the 1830s\\" and the font as \\"a pastiche of the same date\\". Cadw follows Newman, describing the font as having a \\"19th century interlace stem and [a] charming, possibly recut, Romanesque bowl\\". A second plain font may date from the 15th century. Further work by the Welsh architect John Prichard was completed in 1875. The west turret was replaced by a bell arch. The east window dates from 1957, and the church was last restored in 1989-91. On the east side beside the road there is a garden of rest with a calvary cross. The church sits on land between the road and the river Monnow and a contemporary ceramic mosaic has been installed by Monmouth Town Council. The circular plinth is made of 40 tiles that illustrate and commemorate the Millennium showing over 2,000 years of local history.

He explored many of the navigable waterways of the Congo Basin, and led a major expedition to Katanga between 1890 and 1893. Early years Delcommune was born at Namur on 6 October 1855. His father had reached the rank of sergeant major in the engineer corps before retiring and joining the Belgian and French railways. Alexandre Delcommune studied at the Athenaeum in Brussels, then worked for three months as a clerk in the Brussels North railway station before quitting due to boredom. He traveled to Portugal in January 1874 to work for his half brother, the director of a French olive oil factory. Still restless, he got his brother to write a letter of recommendation to one of his Portuguese friends so that he could go to Brazil or Portugal. After less than six months he arrived in S√£o Paulo de Loanda, modern Luanda. Delcommune travelled from Luanda to Ambriz where he joined the French merchant Lasnier-Daumas, Lartigue et Cie. At that time he was one of just sixteen Europeans living in the Congo, and the only Belgian. He arrived at Boma in 1874. He received Henry Morton Stanley in 1877 during Stanley's crossing of the continent from east to west. The Berlin Conference on partition of Africa, 1884 In 1883 Delcommune joined the Association Internationale Africaine. A year later he was appointed director of the Belgian factories in Boma and Noki, and became head of the future capital of the Congo Free State at Boma. He was tasked with getting the local chiefs to accept Belgian sovereignty, and on 19 April 1884 three important agreements were signed. Delcommune had succeeded due to his long familiarity with Boma and to having married a daughter of the principal chief of Boma. The other Europeans trading on the lower Congo River were furious with what they saw as his deception in gaining the treaties. Despite an Anglo-Portuguese treaty signed in February 1884, he obtained recognition of the Etat Independent du Congo, and this was ratified in the Berlin Conference (1884) in which the territory at the mouth of the Congo was divided between the Portuguese, French and Belgians. Congo basin survey In 1886 Delcommune was given a commission by Albert Thys to study whether a planned railway would be profitable. This involved exploring the whole navigable part of the Congo basin, determining what types and quantities of merchandise could be expected, and assessing whether this would justify the investment. For this mission he organized the transport of the components of the steamer Le Roi des Belges overland to Leopoldville, where the boat was assembled. The journey took four months, with another five months to assemble the steamer and launch it. He then explored the Kasai, the Fimi, the Sankuru, Lake Leopold II, the Lubefu, the Kwango and the Kwilu. He went as far up the Congo as Stanley Falls, ascended the Lomami and explored the Aruwimi. He covered of water routes in a year. Slavers attack nearby Nyangwe Delcommune founded the posts of Nioki, Tolo and Dekese among others in the Mai Ndombe District. During this trip he settled an outstanding geographical question when he determined that the Lomani was indeed a tributary of the Congo as Stanley had suspected. He also found that Nyangwe, an important slave-trading center on the Lualaba River, was just three days journey east of the Lomami. His ascent of the Lomani, which he found to be easy to navigate, took seventeen days and covered over to around latitude 4¬∞ South. Running parallel to the Congo, which it enters below the barrier of the Stanley Falls, it reaches far to the south. This discovery opened an important route into the interior. Katanga expedition Albert Thys founded the Compagnie Congolaise pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (CCCI) in 1887. King Leopold granted him extensive trading privileges since his enterprise was seen as a bastion against British interests. When Delcommune returned to Brussels in 1889, he was given charge of a CCCI expedition to Katanga (1890‚Äì1893). The \\"Compagnie du Katanga\\" formed for the expedition was theoretically a private organization, but in practice was an instrument of the Congo Free State. Preparation for the expedition began in May 1890, and the expedition left Matadi in September of that year. With Delcommune were the geologist Diferrich, the naturalist Protche, doctor Briard, Baron de Roest d'Alkemade and Count Soutchoff. Delcommune was charged with exploring the region and examining its local wealth and the problems of transport and communications. The expedition left Kinshasa on 17 October 1890 on two steamers. Ville de Bruxelles was provided by the state and Florida was provided by the Haut Congo Society. Msiri's boma (compound) at Bunkeya. The objects on top of the four poles, below which some of Msiri's warriors are gathered, are heads of his enemies. More skulls are on the stakes forming the stockade. In Katanga, the Nyamwezi trader Msiri had seized power around 1860, expanding his empire to cover a large part of the Luapula valley. By the time of Delcommune's expedition his rule had greatly contracted, but both the Belgians in the free State and the British in Southern Africa were determined to fully control the mineral-rich area of Katanga. Msiri refused to make any formal treaty with either power. Cecil Rhodes had told an agent of the British South Africa Company \\"I want you to get Msiri's. I mean Katanga... You must go and get Katanga\\". A small force of Belgians from an expedition led by Paul Le Marinel had been allowed to establish a post near to Msiri's capital early in 1891. Delcommune's expedition was primarily concerned with finding gold, and secondarily with settling the country. Delcommune was to try to make Msiri accept Belgian rule, and then go south to where the gold fields were thought to be. His chosen route up the Lualaba from Bena-Kamba turned out to be extremely difficult, with many rapids to be negotiated. On 3 May 1891 the expedition reached N'Gongo-Lutita. There they met Rachid, the nephew and successor of Tippoo-Tib, who lent them porters. Delcommune went on by land, making treaties with the local chiefs as he went. Delcommune's expedition reached Bunkeya in October 1891, but he was unable to persuade Msiri to accept Belgian rule and continued south. In December 1891 a larger expedition arrived at Bunkeya from Zanzibar. At the age of 25 the Canadian-born engineer, soldier and mercenary William Grant Stairs had been second in command of Henry Morton Stanley's 1887 expedition to relieve Emin Pasha in Equatoria. In 1891 he was commissioned to lead an expedition to Bunkeya to obtain Msiri's submission. Stairs demanded that Msiri accept the sovereignty of Leopold II over his territory. Msiri again refused and fled to a nearby village where he was killed by members of Stairs' force. Resistance ceased and Katanga came under Belgian rule. In August 1892, Delcommune's expedition was returning north by way of Lake Tanganyika, where he came to the assistance of a group of missionaries from the London Missionary Society at Albertville who were threatened by Arab slavers. However, in an attempt to gain control of the Arab fort the Belgians were beaten off. Later career After the Katanga expedition Delcommune assumed an important role in the CCCI group of companies. He returned to Europe in 1895, where he was offered a position as Inspector of the Free State by King Leopold II of Belgium. Delcommune refused, not wanting to spend more time in Africa. In his memoirs, written much later, he said that he disagreed with the brutal techniques being used in developing the rubber economy. He did return to the Congo the same year as an inspector of the SAB. He continued to travel, visiting Brazil and the Dutch and British colonies in Asia. He also became part owner with Albert Thys of a cocoa plantation in S√£o Tom√©. During the First World War Delcommune was the author of a sharp attack on the colonial administration. He called for improved sanitation, a pragmatic education system focused mainly on agriculture, and measures to reduce the price of goods in the colony but to impose minimum prices for native products. Delcommune died in Brussels on 7 August 1922. Legacy A Belgian steamer on Lake Tanganyika that fought against the forces of German East Africa during the First World War was named the Alexandre Del Commune. His name was given to the artificial Lake Delcommune, near Kolwezi, formed by a dam across the Lualaba to provide hydroelectric power and a water supply to the copper mining operations.

Both horses and armoury collection of the Saxon dukes were housed here; two halls on the building‚Äôs ground floor provided space for 128 horses. The upper floors were designed as collection rooms for the vast collection of princely armoury, wardrobe and utensils for pageants of the Dresden court. The Renaissance-era building was designed as one of the first autonoumus collection buildings in central Europe by Paul Buchner on behalf of Prince Elector Christian I of Saxony. The Stallgeb√§ude after its extension with an upper floor and a staircase in 1731 The upper floor dates back to 1730 and 1731, when on Augustus II the Strong's request, the building was converted into a guest house and later into a museum. The double-flight staircase was added in 1731. The royal painting collection was moved from the Dresden Castle to the Stallgeb√§ude in 1747 and remained there until 1855.Harald Marx: Gem√§ldegalerie Dresden - F√ºhrer Alte Meister . E. A. Seemann, Leipzig, 3. Aufl., 2006, , pp. 8-17. After another building alteration between 1872 and 1876, the Stallgeb√§ude was renamed the Johanneum, after the Saxonian King John (Johann in German). The Dresden Porcelain Collection was moved into the Johanneum in 1876, followed in 1877 by the Dresden Armory collection. The building was severely damaged during the February 13, 1945 bombing of Dresden in World War II. Its reconstruction began in 1950, and the renovation of the facade was finished in 1960. Since this reconstruction, the Johanneum has been home to the Dresden Transport Museum.

They joined the Football League Third Division North, when it was established after the restructuring of the English league system. The club played their first fixture, against Crewe Alexandra, at Prenton Park on 27 August 1921, winning 4‚Äì1. Rovers ended the season in 18th place out of 20 teams, finishing ahead on goal average from Halifax Town, who had to apply for re-election. They were eliminated from the FA Cup in the Fourth Qualifying Round, losing a replay to non-league Altrincham.  Review  Before first Football League match Prior to the start of the 1919‚Äì20 season, The Football League had formed a new Third Division, composed primarily of southern teams. On 7 March 1921, Tranmere ‚Äì then members of the Central League ‚Äì were invited to become founder members of the new Division Three North. At this time the team were managed by Bert Cooke, who did so for 23 years in total, the club record for longest serving manager. In preparation for their new football league status, Tranmere made eleven new signings, meaning there were 25 professional players by the start of the season. They also bought the freehold on their ground, Prenton Park, for ¬£7,500. Unlike their neighbours Everton and Liverpool, Tranmere could not sustain such growth and were forced to raise admission prices, causing an outcry amongst fans. On 27 August 1921 at 3:15 pm, Tranmere started their first Football League match against Crewe Alexandra at Prenton Park. Attendance was affected by the new ticket prices, with 7,011 spectators present. Billy Caulfield scored first for Crewe, with Charles Milnes equalising for Tranmere as they went on to a 4‚Äì1 victory. Tranmere's first six games produced two wins, two draws and two defeats. However, they performed poorly over the rest of the season. They were eliminated from the FA Cup in the Fourth Qualifying Round, losing 4‚Äì2 to non-league Altrincham at home, after a 4‚Äì4 away draw, and thus being the Robins' first ever league victims. They finished 18th of 20 in the league, only finishing ahead of Halifax Town on goal average, who had to apply for re-election. The optimism felt by the directors at the start of the season about being on par with their Merseyside rivals changed to uncertainty. This is reflected in the statistics for the season: thirty-one players were used in total, with only seven making more than twenty appearances; the top league scorer was Fred Groves, with seven goals.

D. Premasiri (born 1941) is a Buddhist scholar specializing in the areas of Buddhist ethics and Buddhist philosophy. Premasiri's academic training represents a synthesis of both the Buddhist and Western philosophical traditions, first at the University of Peradeniya and subsequently at Cambridge and Hawaii. He is currently President of the Buddhist Publication Society and Professor Emeritus in the Department of Pali and Buddhist Studies at the University of Peradeniya. Early life P. D. Premasiri was born in Kotte, a suburb of Colombo, British Ceylon on July 25, 1941. He received his primary and secondary education from Christian College, a boys' school in Kotte presently known as Sri Jayawardenepura Maha Vidyalaya. Inspired by his father's talks on Buddhism, Premasiri started studying Pali at the age of 14. Education He entered the University of Peradeniya in 1959 as a student in the Pali and Buddhist Civilization Department where he chose Pali as his subject of specialization. At Peradeniya he studied under Buddhist scholars Venerable Professor Dhammavihari, W.S. Karunaratne, Lily de Silva, and David Kalupahana. Although Premasiri was not enrolled in the Philosophy Department, he also audited a class under Philosophy Professor K.N. Jayatilleke with his permission. In 1963, after receiving a B.A. in Pali with First Class Honours, Premasiri was invited to join the Peradeniya academic staff as a temporary assistant lecturer and was awarded an Oriental Studies scholarship to study abroad. With encouragement from K.N. Jayatilleke, Premasiri traveled to the UK in 1965 and studied western ethics and philosophy at the University of Cambridge under notable British Philosophers such as Sir Bernard Williams. While at Cambridge, a contemporary and friend to Premasiri was leading Buddhist scholar L.S. Cousins. After earning a second B.A. and an M.A. in Western Philosophy at Cambridge, he returned to Peradeniya in 1968 and taught in both the Pali and Buddhist Civilization Department and the Department of Buddhist Philosophy. In 1972 the two Buddhist studies departments at Peradeniya were uprooted during the Sri Lankan government's university reorganization. Premasiri, along with several other professors, protested the reorganization and their petition resulted in the Department of Language and Cultural Studies, which would later become the renewed Pali and Buddhist Studies Department at Peradeniya. In the aftermath of university reorganizing, Premasiri received an East-West Center Fellowship to study for his PhD at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In 1977, he traveled to Hawaii and worked on his doctorate for three years under eminent philosophers David Kalupahana and Eliot Deutsch in the University of Hawaii's Philosophy Department. In 1980, after receiving his PhD in Comparative Philosophy from Hawaii, he again returned to Peradeniya to continue teaching. Academic career In the years following his return to the University of Peradeniya, Premasiri served in both the Department of Philosophy and the Department of Pali and Buddhist Studies. In 1997, Premasiri became head of the Pali and Buddhist Studies Department and served in this role until 2004, with a one-year research sabbatical in Norway. In 2006, Premasiri retired as the Pali and Buddhist Studies Department's Senior Professor, and in 2007 Premasiri was named Professor Emeritus at Peradeniya, where he continues to teach. The beginnings of P.D. Premasiri's academic career as a lecturer and professor were intermingled with his pursuit for academic training. Premasiri's academic career can be seen as a synthesis between Western academia and early Buddhist thought. He combined the western and Buddhist intellectual traditions by teaching the fundamentals of early Buddhist thought with a western scholastic approach and by critiquing Western Philosophy from an early Buddhist perspective. P.D. Premasiri's professional integrity can be understood by his focus on early Buddhist ethics in his writings and his continual commitment to preserving the Buddhist academic tradition at the University of Peradeniya. Though he traveled to the U.K. and to the U.S. to receive academic training, he continually returned to the country of his birth and especially to the University of Peradeniya to serve and teach. In the course of Premasiri's fifty-year academic career, he has published articles in a vast array of academic journals, contributed several entries to the Encyclopedia of Buddhism, and written essays and newsletters for the BPS. He has presented and participated in academic institutions and conferences around the world, in countries including Thailand, Malaysia, Norway, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Korea, England, France, South Africa, India, Switzerland, and the US. He has also served as guest faculty for a number of universities outside of Peradeniya. In 1988/89, a Fulbright Scholar- in-Residence Program took him to Colby College in Waterville, Maine where he served as a Visiting Professor in the Philosophy Department. In 1999, he served as a Guest Researcher in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bergen, Norway. In 2000, he served as Guest Researcher at the Department of Religion at the same university. In 2004 he taught at Washington State University at Pullman in the Philosophy Department. In 2007 he taught at Colgate University Hamilton, New York in the Department of Religious Studies. In 2009 he co-founded and was named director of academic affairs at SIBA, where he continues to teach and provide academic leadership for SIBA's Department of Buddhist Studies. He has also taught at the Buddhist College in Singapore, Buddha Dhamma Mandala Society in Singapore, and Thanghsian Institution in Malaysia.  Organizational appointments  Premasiri also serves on various non-profit boards. He has been a long-time member of the Board of Management of the Buddhist Publication Society (PBS) in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and in 2011 succeeded Bhikkhu Bodhi as the 3rd President of the Buddhist Publication Society. In addition to currently serving as President of BPS, he founded and currently serves as president for the Society for the Integration of Science and Human Values (SISHVA), and he is the president of the Sri Lanka Association for Buddhist Studies (SLABS). Besides these organizational involvements, Premasiri has also conducted a Meditation and Pali Text Study Group in Kandy on a regular basis since 1994.

The Bimbache are one of several peoples native to the Canaries, with a genetic and cultural link to the Berber people of North Africa. The Bimbache people shared a common link with other aboriginal peoples of the Canary Islands. The island of El Hierro was known to the Bimbache as Eser√≥ or Her√≥. The word \\"Bimbache\\" means \\"Sons of the Sons of Tenerife\\", so were believed to be descendants of the Guanches, the ancient inhabitants of the island of Tenerife.  Division of aboriginal territory  Satellite image of the island of El Hierro. Unlike the other Canary Islands, El Hierro had no internal territorial divisions.  The Spanish conquest and the Bimbache  left The Spanish conquest was carried out in late 1405 by Jean de B√©thencourt, who promised to respect the freedom of the Bimbache, and there was no resistance from the small aboriginal population. This promise was broken by de B√©thencourt's son, who sold most of the Bimbache inhabitants as slaves, and the island was repopulated with Spanish and Norman settlers.Historia, El Hierro, Islas Canarias Before the arrival of the Castilian and Aragonese crown forces, the population was largely pastoral, raising cattle, goats, sheep and pigs, alongside the cultivation of grain and maritime resources. As there was no merchant trade routes servicing the island, the vessels that brought the inhabitants to the island were destroyed with time, and left a domestic market whose trading system was based on the exchange of local produce. Land and other common resources were managed and distributed equally by collective agreements held during meetings chaired by a mediating king, using a system of participatory democracy where the king was a figure of justice and democratic mediation.  Bimbache mythology  Each island of the Canaries had its own gods, distinct to each island, though the islands shared common concepts in their mythology, such as divine power represented by Nature. The two benign deities in El Hierro were the god Eraorahan and the goddess Moneiba, with a third malevolent god, Aranfaybo, who was prayed to in times of desperation. The gradual expansion of control by the Crown of Castile and Aragon delegated benefits of both land and commercial production rights to a minority by means of a feudal regime. Additionally, the native religion's symbols of nature were suppressed in order to introduce Christianity to the island. Both before and after the incorporation of El Hierro to the Spanish crown, some population of working age were taken from the island to Castile for slave labour, before being later regaining the status of human beings, and being returned to the island. Later, the island was also populated by people of French and Galician origin, also under a feudal system by the Crowns of Castile and Aragon. Genetics examined the remains of a large number of Bimbache buried at Punta Azul, El Hierro c. 1015-1200 AD. The 16 samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to the paternal haplogroups E1a (1 sample), E1b1b1a1 (7 samples) and R1b1a2 (7 samples). All the extracted samples of mtDNA belonged to the maternal haplogroup H1-1626. E1a is most common in sub-Saharan Africa, while E1b1b1a1 is very common in North Africa. R1b1a2 is considered a typical European lineage, but is also found at low frequencies in North Africa. About 10% of examined Guanches of Gran Canaria have been found to be carriers of R1b1a2. The dominance of a single maternal lineage (H1-1626) suggested that the Bimbache were a matrilineal society. The authors of the study suggested that the Bimbache were descended from the earliest of two or more migration waves from North Africa to the Canary Islands.

During the hearing, Sobottka affirmed he was not a fascist, nor had he ever engaged in counter-revolutionary activity.

He was a knight of the Order of Santiago. Life and career Juan Mart√≠nez de Recalde was born in Bilbao around 1540.Martin, Parker, p. 10. He joined the Spanish Navy at an early age, entering the Biscay Squadron. He commanded an escort of three fleets to the Indies. He gained fame when he was instrumental in the rescue of a gold-laden galleon at Madeira Island, as a result of which he was awarded command of the Laredo Fleet. He became linked with the influential Admiral √Ålvaro de Baz√°n. It was under de Baz√°n's command that de Recalde took part in two expeditions to the Azores in the early 1580s. Later that decade, he was granted command of an operation to oppose the English in Ireland, where he landed a number of troops. He was appointed as Admiral of the Fleet which would spearhead a planned invasion of England, an operation under the overall command of the Duke of Medina-Sidonia. He commanded the Biscayan squadron in the battle, but rather than command that squadron's flagship, the Santa Ana a 30-gun vessel,Martin, Parker (1999), p. 262. he commanded the vice-flagship of the principal squadron, the San Juan de Portugal a larger, 50-gun ship.Martin, Parker (1999), p. 15.Martin, Parker (1999), p. 261. He was also second-in- command of the entire fleet. Despite his role, de Recalde had little operational power, and lacking support from the Duke, he underwent a number of battles below fighting strength. In addition, although he was second-in- command, he would have not gained operational command of the fleet had the Duke died; this would have instead passed to the nobly born Don Alonso Mart√≠nez de Leiva.Martin, Parker (1999), p. 11. He was separated from the fleet in one skirmish in July 1588, and had to battle with several of the most powerful English ships. Although he survived the battle, he lost a significant number of men, and his ships suffered heavy damage. Towards the end of the operation, he was forced to put into port in Ireland, and then returned to A Coru√±a, suffering from fever and battle wounds.

Wyman St. in Rockford, Illinois, is a historic building originally used by the Rockford Morning Star. Architecture Built in 1927‚Äì28, the building was designed by Davenport, Iowa, architecture firm Clausen, Kruse & Klein. The firm designed the building in the Classical Revival style. The building's terra cotta exterior is segmented by pilasters with decorative capitals. Decorative panels situated near the building's entrance feature Art Deco and Egyptian elements, including rows of chevrons and a guilloch√© of lotus buds. History The first newspapers in Rockford, Illinois were The Rock River Express and the Rockford Star, both first published in 1840. Both papers lasted only a year. The Winnebago Forum, renamed The Republican in 1845, was the first city paper to have a lengthy publishing period (1842-1862). The Rockford Morning Star first published in 1888. It merged with the Rockford Daily Register-Gazette in 1928. Ruth Hanna McCormick Simms purchased the paper two years later, and again split the two papers, publishing the Morning Star as a morning daily. The paper was purchased by the Gannett Company in 1967, who merged the last two remaining Rockford papers in 1979 to create the Rockford Register Star. The Rockford Morning Star Building was constructed during negotiations for the 1928 merge. However, the building was only used for two years; after its acquisition by Simms, a new tower was built on the other side of the Rock River. The building remained in the possession of the Simms family, who leased it to the George Rogers Clark Mutual Company. It was eventually absorbed into the Pioneer Life Insurance Company. The company bought the building from the Simms family in 1946. The company moved to Schaumburg in 1993 and henceforth only used the Rockford building for storage and mailing. The company merged into Conseco, Inc. in 1996. The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1999. It was listed as a contributing property to the West Downtown Rockford Historic District in 2007.

The take-off from a place is possible when speed of a wind exceeds 8 m/s, otherwise running start up to 15 m is necessary. The riveted covering is made of duralumin. The first produced consignment consisted of five autogyros. The A-002M is a further development. Design and development The A-002 has an enclosed, streamlined cabin accessed by large, windowed side doors. The two front seats have dual control and there is a third seat behind. The fully enclosed, pusher configuration flat four AviaSmart engine is placed behind the cabin with a pair of cooling air intakes above its roof. The propeller thrustline is at cabin roof height. The two-blade rotor is mounted on a tall streamlined pylon at the rear of the cabin. In flight, the rotor is undriven but it can be spun up by the engine for jump starts made with no take-off run. Without this spin-up, take-off requires a run of 30 m (100 ft). The A-002 has composite tail surfaces mounted on a short boom joined to the bottom of the cabin/engine pod. The fin carries a mass- and horn-balanced rudder and an all-moving tailplane at ‚Öì fin height. The A-002 has a fixed, wide track tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels on cantilever spring legs. The date of the first flight was originally announced as 21 April 2002 but later revised by the manufacturer to 6 July 2002. Production of five A-002s began in August 2002 but no deliveries were made until 2004, when production was halted for further development. Several revisions have been made including much enlarged engine air intakes and the addition of endplate fins to the tailpane. The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of the A-200 has increased from 900 kg (1,984 lb) to 950 kg (2094 lb) and both the rotor and fuselage have been significantly extended. The more recent A-002M upgrade has further raised the MTOW to 1,030 kg (2,270 lb). There have also been tests of four- and six-bladed propellers. In 2005 the autogyro project participated in the Russian Innovation Contest where it was declared that at least 150 copies should be sold to pay back the project. In 2006 a renewed version with an AviaSmart engine and a new extended main rotor was named A-002M. In 2008 it was declared about the certification of such autogyro type that year according to the actual aviation rules, however, even by 2012 the certificate has not been received yet. In 2010 they published a specification for more heavy and expensive version of A-002M. The possibility of jump take-off remained, but it is not considered regular any more due to enhanced load on the bearing structure. It was also reported about developing of the unmanned version. One case of the autogyro's experimental operation by the IrkutskEnergo company in 2006 is known; no further cooperation with this company has been reported ever. A-002M and A-002 at MAKS-2007 air show Operational history By late 2003 twenty A-002s had been ordered by Susuman Susumanzoloto OAO, a mining company who had received two, and by Irkutskehenergo OAO, who had received another two for power line inspections. Five had been delivered by 2007. Variants ;A-002: Original version. ;A-002M: Heavier upgrade, specification released 2010. Failures and incidents On July 24, 2012 at 17:15 local time the autogyro Irkut-A002M made an emergency landing to the moorland near Bokovo, the Irkutsk region. The one- pilot crew did not suffer. The preliminary version stated that the failure was caused by a crack in the oil header of the main rotor forced start drive, which entailed oil leakage in the autogyro's general oil system. The inexperienced pilot did not notice loss of oil pressure and continued the flight. The apparatus crash-landed on the main rotor autorotation and suffered severe damage due to poor piloting technique.

It has been individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. In 2004 it was included as a contributing property in the Marycrest College Historic District. History Max Petersen was the son of J.H.C. Petersen, who was an immigrant from the Duchy of Schleswig, which was then in the Kingdom of Denmark. with He eventually established a retail store in Davenport. His sons entered business with him and they took over the business in 1892. The business continues to exist as the Von Maur department store. Max was the oldest of the three brothers, and he had Davenport architect Frederick G. Clausen design a Queen Anne style home for his family in 1888. Bishop Henry Rohlman of the Catholic Diocese of Davenport commissioned the Rev. Thomas V. Lawlor from St. Ambrose College to look for property to start a college for women. In 1937 he acquired the property, which was then called Clifton Hill, for $50,000. The donors for the project included members of the Petersen family. The property included the house and . Marycrest College was established on the property in 1939, and the Petersen home initially became the sister's residence. Over the years it served other functions for the college. After the college was disbanded in 2002 it was acquired by Chris Ales and became part of the Marycrest Senior Campus. Architecture Rear view of the house The 2¬Ω-story house is basically square in shape, however, it is narrower and a little lower in the back. The brick structure rests on a rock- faced stone foundation. It is capped by a high hip roof. Both the east and west sides of the house feature projecting gable ends. A turret with a conical roof is located on the southwest corner of the main fa√ßade. The southeast corner features a rectangular shaped corner bay with a second floor porch and its own hipped roof. In the center is a tall projecting tower. Single story porches with flat roofs are located on the front and east sides of the house. At the roofline is a narrow cornice. Three string courses encircle the house flush with the brick surface. Decorative elements are restrained. They are mainly found on the large dentils on the cornice, the turned Eastlake post and punched frieze on the second story porch, and a wall dormer on the central tower that has an elaborate projecting sill and triangular pediment.

It was abolished on 1 February 2013. The system was adopted to avoid traffic congestion at toll plazas. An alternative to KGS is the OGS system of radio-frequency identification (RFID) transponder type implemented on at the same toll plazas initially. The KGS was launched in January 2005, and was first installed on the toll bridges Bosphorus Bridge on O-1 and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge on O-2 over the Istanbul Strait. The smart card system was later extended to the intercity motorways O-3, O-4, O-32, O-51 and O-52. The KGS was in use on all toll roads in the country alongside the OGS until it was replaced by HGS. Developed by ASELSAN, the system is administrated by the General Directorate of Highways (, KGM). Tolling The contactless smart card, which has the dimensions of a credit card, can be obtained from the office of toll plazas, authorized major banks and mobile points of sales. There are two types of KGS card depending on how the charge on thecard is paid. NKGS (Nakit KGS) for cash payment and KKGS (Kredili KGS) for credit payment. Motorists, who have a bank account, can obtain the KGS card from the bank, which recharges it automatically when the amount on the KKGS card falls under a predefined minimum limƒ±t. By NKGS, the card is recharged by cash payment only. Both KGS cards are issued for a specific vehicle category. While KKGS is associated with a specific licence plate and can not be transferred without notice to the provider, the NKGS card may be used for any vehicle of its toll category issued. The card number and the vehicle category are printed visible on both KGS cards. Unlike by OGS, which allows the motorist a 20% discount, KGS card requires full toll payment except for motorcyclists. At the toll plaza, the vehicle has to drive to a toll booth on the KGS-only assigned lane. KGS-lanes are situated always rightside to the OGS-lanes, and they are designated at some distance before the toll plaza. The booth is marked with KGS-sign at the top. A flashing green light at the top signals its usability. Unlike at OGS-lanes, there are gate arms on the exit of KGS-lanes. There are two card readers at each booth in order to give comfort to the driver depending on the height of the driver cabin. The vehicle has to stop at the toll booth shortly. The contactless smart card, brought close to the reader's antenna at a distance of about , communicates with the reader through an induction technology at 13.56 MHz. Information such as the card number, the vehicle category and the charge amount, which are stored on the embedded chip of the KGS card, are transmitted to the toll collection system. Vehicles are classified for toll purposes in six categories based on the wheelbase and the number of axles. If the number of axles of a vehicle is less than the maximum number of axles -because some axles of a truck are lifted up or a tractor is running without its trailer-, the integrated automated vehicle classification system changes the vehicle category read in to the actual one during the passage allowing a lower toll tariff. The bridge toll is fixed for each vehicle category, and is charged only once in eastward direction on the two bridges in Istanbul. The road toll is rated further depending on the distance driven between the entry and the exit of motorway for each vehicle category. For this reason, a signal has to be initiated on the KGS-lane by entering the motorway. At the toll booth's reader, an electronic display summarizes the tolling process showing one of the following messages: *KARTINIZI OKUTUNUZ (Get your card read): Before entering the KGS-lane. *BAKƒ∞YE (Balance): For NKGS cards only the balance on the card. *ƒ∞≈ûLEM TAMAM, G√úLE G√úLE (Operation complete, Good bye): For both KGS cards. Three beeps sound and there is a green light. *KART ƒ∞PTAL EDƒ∞LDƒ∞ (Card revoked): Operation unsuccessful, a red light is lit and twice two beeps sound. *GE√áERSƒ∞Z KART (Invalid card): Operation unsuccessful, a red light is lit and twice two beeps sound. *YETERSƒ∞Z BAKƒ∞YE (Insufficient balance): Operation unsuccessful, a red light is lit and twice two beeps sound. *ONAY SESƒ∞Nƒ∞ DUYMADAN KARTI √áEKMEYƒ∞N (Do not remove card before having heard the approval sound): When the operation can not be completed due to the removal of the card out of the proximity area. *ƒ∞≈ûLEM TAMAM, KARTA PARA Y√úKLEYƒ∞N (Operation complete. Recharge card): If the balance on the NKGS card is insufficient for a next toll payment. Four beeps sounds. *√úCRET ve BOR√á (Toll and Credit): For NKGS card, when the vehicle category was improper and the card charge insufficient. Violation If the tolling process is not successful, a lamp under the electronic message display at the KGS booth turns red for a short time, and the display shows the appropriate violation message. Further, the driver is warned by a loud electronic horn at the booth, and the vehicle is photographed as well for evidence. In case of unmatched vehicle category, the card's account is charged with the actual category. However, the driver is warned by the booth horn, and the vehicle is photographed. Card's account is charged with additional fine in amount of ten maximum toll for each violation. Vehicle is blacklisted when this type of violation occurs more than twice. Vehicle owners or drivers can query information about their violation online or at a call center. Payment of the fine within 15 days following the violation notice's receipt enables 25% discount according to Turkish law. Replacement of KGS by HGS Compared to the OGS toll payment system, the KGS caused traffic congestion during rush hours on the dedicated lanes at the toll plazas, particularly on the toll bridges over Bosporus in Istanbul, because the vehicles have to stop shortly to pay at the KGS toll booth. For this reason, the KGS system was replaced with the new HGS system, which uses radio- frequency identification (RFID) technology. The HGS was launched on September 17, 2012, while the KGS will be in use until December 31, 2012 at all toll plazas. However, one KGS lane at each toll bridge on Bosporus will stay open until January 31, 2013.

He was educated at Charterhouse School before entering the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.Who Was Who He passed out of Sandhurst in 1886, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) on 25 August.Quarterly Army List, 1919, p. 51d. He remained with his regiment for thirteen years, with a promotion to Captain in 1896, until he was appointed as the adjutant to a volunteer battalion in India in February 1899. While in India, in 1897, he married Margaret Elizabeth Beresford, the daughter of John Stuart Beresford, chief engineer of the Punjab government.\\"BERESFORD, John Stuart\\". (2007). In Who Was Who. Online edition He returned to regimental duties in January 1904, having remained in India throughout the Boer War, and was promoted to Major in September. In October 1913, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and appointed to command the 1st Battalion of the Cameronians. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 1st Cameronians were one of four independent battalions earmarked for service with the British Expeditionary Force as line of communications troops.Edmonds, p. 425 They landed in France on 11 August, and on 22 August all four were grouped into the 19th Infantry Brigade for frontline service. Under Robertson's command, the battalion first saw action on 23 August at the Battle of Mons, where the 19th Brigade held the far left of the British line,Edmonds, p. 78 It served in reserve during the Battle of Le Cateau, covering the retreat of the 5th Division at the end of the day's fighting.Edmonds, pp. 161-178 The battalion returned to the front in October, where it repulsed several heavy attacks, and remained in line during the winter of 1914-15, under the command of 6th Division.Marden, appendix III. When the 6th Division was relieved by the 27th Division in late May 1915, the 19th Brigade remained in place and was transferred to the new division; shortly afterwards, on 15 June, Robertson was promoted to command the brigade, with the temporary rank of Brigadier-General. He succeeded the Hon. Frederick Gordon, who had been promoted to command the 22nd Division.Quarterly Army List, 1919 , p. 39 In August, the brigade was again transferred, to the 2nd Division, and under this new command it took part in the Battle of Loos in September. At Loos, the brigade was under orders to attack behind a barrage of chlorine gas on 25 September, but early on the morning of the attack the wind changed. Robertson applied for permission to cancel the gas attack, but was refused, and it was released according to schedule; as a result, it lay in clouds along the trench line, some drifting back into the British positions.Dunn, p. 153 The subsequent attack was almost completely unsuccessful, at the cost of heavy casualties.Dunn, pp. 154-8 A second assault on the 27th was ordered, but Robertson gave instructions that the infantry attack was to be held back until the gas could be seen to have effect; the gas failed a second time, and the attack was cancelled.Dunn, p. 158 The brigade did not see heavy action through the remainder of the battle, spending most of October in reserve, and in late November was transferred to the newly arrived 33rd Division.Dunn, pp. 164-8 The following winter was mostly quiet, with occasional shelling and raids; on 2 January, the Brigade HQ was bombarded with some casualties, though Robertson appears to have been uninjured,Dunn, p. 175. \\"Robertson\\" is quoted here as remarking approvingly of the shelling, but from context this seems to be a battalion officer of the same name. and in early April, a battalion history notes that \\"the Brigadier's barber [was] wounded while he was cutting the Brigadier's hair\\" at HQ.Dunn, p. 188 In the spring, raiding resumed again,Dunn, pp. 192, 195 and in May the brigade took up a larger section of the line in order to free troops for the Somme offensive.Dunn, p. 202 On 22 June, the largest mine constructed by the Germans on the Western Front was detonated in this sector, with heavy casualties, and a retaliatory raid followed on 5 July;Dunn, pp. 209-221 two days later, the division was ordered south to take part in the Battle of the Somme, which had begun on 1 July.Dunn, p. 222 Before it moved into the line, Robertson relinquished command of 19th Brigade; on 13 July he was promoted to take over 17th (Northern) Division, succeeding Thomas Pilcher. From June 1919 to June 1923 he commanded the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, Territorial Army, his last post. Later career and retirement Robertson retired to Bideford:‚ÄòROBERTSON, Maj.-Gen.

In the background (northwards), Asiago plateau and Grappa mountain. Rosta Ros√† flowing out from Parco \\"Civilt√† delle Rogge\\" near Bassano del Grappa practical exclaves (to the right) and the territory of Ros√† (to the left) The Parco rurale sovracomunale \\"Civilt√† delle Rogge\\", often called Parco delle Rogge, is a regional park of local interest as per regional law of Veneto 40/1984, art.27. It is included in the municipal territories of Bassano del Grappa, Cartigliano and Ros√†, province of Vicenza, Veneto. The park was established under the provisions of Government of Veneto's deliberations no.801/2002, 1272/2002 e 3283/2002 and has an area of about 250 ha, of which 150 ha are within the municipality of Ros√†. Geographical location  The park has an irregular perimeter. The area of the park is bounded by Strada Provinciale 111 (Nuova Gasparona) to the north and by Strada Provinciale 58 (Ca' Dolfin) to the south. The eastern boundary of the park runs near via Molino in localit√† Baggi in Ros√†, while the westernmost side stretches parallel to the boundary between Quartiere Pre in Bassano del Grappa and the municipality of Cartigliano, but some meters within the territory of Bassano. A number of small roads runs through the park, mainly stretching from the east to the west, but they are not always connected to each other: in some cases it is necessary to exit the area of the park, move northwards or southwards, and then re-enter the park. The park can be accessed from the following main points: * North: Via Riva Bianca, in Quartier Pr√®, Bassano del Grappa (it becomes Via del Carmine, in Ros√†) * West: Via delle Orchidee (Cavin√≥n), in Quartier Pr√®, Bassano del Grappa (it becomes Via del Rosario, entering Ros√†) * West: Via San Giorgio, along the border between Bassano del Grappa and Cartigliano (it becomes Via Monte San Michele, in Ros√†) * South: Via Monte San Michele, in Ros√† (it then becomes Via San Giorgio, entering Cartigliano) * South and east: Via Capitello, in Travettore, Ros√† * East: Via del Rosario (Cavin√≥n), in Travettore, Ros√† (it becomes Via delle Orchidee, entering Bassano del Grappa) * East: Via del Carmine, in Ponte Storto, Ros√† (it becomes Via Riva Bianca, in Bassano del Grappa) Peculiarities Within the rural park, mostly consisting of the old lands of aristocratic family Morosin, a network of irrigation ditches flows. These ditches, called roste by locals, were built over the centuries under different dominations and still reach a number of municipalities well beyond the boundaries of the park. The park is thus a valuable testimony of the old holding structure in the area, before the urban drift of the last century. In the territory of the park there are also one of the last Roman unmade roads left in Veneto, the decumanus DD IX called Cavin√≥n (that is, big cav√¨n, a word that in venetian language indicates a boundary path between two or more fields), and a small church dating back to the period of the Longobards, the church of San Giorgio (Saint George). Various findings of the period of ancient Adriatic Veneti have been dug out in the areas near the park. Administratively, there are some municipal practical exclaves within and close to the park boundaries. Via del Carmine is a road that runs irregularly along the boundary between Bassano del Grappa, to the north, and Ros√†, to the south: some houses in territory of Bassano, on the northern side, can be reached through the street only from Ros√†, in the south. In some case, the street that reaches the exclaves also crosses one of the channels that flow through the park.

This was the case in both Catholic liturgy and in the Puritan tradition. In the Catholic liturgy the Gregorian chant was for a thousand years the predominant musical form. In the Puritan tradition, there was traditionally a use of unaccompanied Psalms. Many Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Orthodox Church, eschew the use of musical instruments in church services. Some Holiness Churches of the Methodist tradition, such as the Free Methodist Church, opposed the use of musical instruments in church worship until the mid-20th century. The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955. The Reformed Free Methodist Church and Evangelical Wesleyan Church were formed as a result of a schism with the Free Methodist Church, with the former retaining a cappella worship and the latter retaining the rule limiting the number of instruments in the church to the piano and organ.

The portal dates back to 2008 and stems from an orientation by the Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation. The portal is an international platform for exchange of experiences and good practices in the framework of a tourism based on values and not only on services and consumerism. History The portal originates from an orientation of the Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation. In 20 years of activity, the Foundation elaborated a new concept of the cultural heritage as an instrument of understanding among cultures. According to this orientation, cultural heritage is not only to be safeguarded and enhanced, but also to be ‚Äúused and enjoyed‚Äù to foster intercultural dialogue. In September 2008 the Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation announced the establishment of the association Life Beyond Tourism for Intercultural Dialogue. Soon after, a Declaration of Intents was signed (March 2008) by 59 experts of the Foundation from 20 different countries. In February 2011 the association developed the Life Beyond Tourism Non-Profit Portal. According to the LBT Manifesto ‚Äúthe tourist is a potential harbinger of knowledge and of intercultural dialogue‚Äù and therefore ‚Äúthe tourist destination is a workshop of knowledge, providing all visitors with an opportunity for cultural growth‚Äù The Province of Florence welcomed the LBT orientation and decided to promote it. Many other cultural institutions and public administrations in Central Europe and Eurasia also joined the initiative. Main features Life Beyond Tourism gathers the cultural expressions representing a given region to provide a good picture of its ‚Äúcultural personality‚Äù resulting from the interaction between its cultural heritage and ongoing developments. The aim of the portal is to convey a territory‚Äôs specific features and to emphasize the way in which tangible and intangible heritage is combined to human and environmental levels. The portal is addressed to all cultural institutions, companies, professional and individuals who share the philosophy of the portal. In particular there are some typologies of members: * cultural institutions, academies, foundations, associations, local authorities that operates in the field of cultural heritage; * enterprises and companies rooted in the territory * individuals that share the values of the LBT Manifesto and are willing to understand the cultural personality of a given territory The portal is non-profit: the profits of memberships are reinvested into for cultural and development initiatives in the territory itself. The supporters of Life Beyond Tourism promote a tourism of high cultural quality with a special focus on intercultural dialogue.

The reserve is, in effect, an island, being surrounded by the river channels, drainage ditches and wetland areas of the Broads. It is only accessible by an unusual floating swing bridge across the River Thurne from the village of Martham. The reserve is owned by the National Trust and is within the Broads National Park and the civil parish of Potter Heigham. It is only opened to the public for one day a year. It has been suggested that Heigham Holmes was used by the Special Operations Executive as a secret airfield between 1940 and 1944, with Lysander aircraft operating from the airfield to ferry agents to occupied Europe. However, no evidence of an airfield has been found in any records (military or local), maps or on aerial photographs, and any military-type structures that may have existed would appear to have been removed by the end of the Second World War, therefore any such usage cannot be confirmed. The subject of an airfield having existed in Heigham Holmes was featured erroneously in the BBC's Secret Britain television series, first broadcast in 2010.

He was a journalist, writer, publisher, scientist, musician and lithographer. Biography Little is known about the youth of Napol√©on Aubin. The son of Pierre Louis Charles Aubin and Elisabeth Escuyer, he emigrated to New York in 1829 where he was to be a pastor in Biddeford, Maine. In 1835 he moved to Montreal, and then again to Quebec City, later that year.Piazza, Fran√ßois. Le M√©morial de Qu√©bec: Le Qu√©bec de 1839 √† 1889. soci√©t√© des √âditions du m√©morial, 1980, p.22 Aubin served as editor for numerous newspapers and magazines, including Le Canadien, L'Ami du peuple, de l'ordre et des lois (Law and Order), and La Tribune. In 1865, he launched the paper Les veill√©es du p√®re Bonsens. A satirist, he wrote works in support of the Patriote movement, publishing his stories in Le Fantasque, a magazine he himself founded. He spent 53 days in prison for publishing a poem by Joseph- Guillaume Barthe, Aux exil√©s politiques canadiens. Aubin considered himself a liberal and a democrat, and in line with √âtienne Parent, chose not participate in the Rebellion of 1837. In 1847, he published Manifeste adress√© au peuple du Canada par le Comit√© constitutionnel de la r√©forme et du progr√®s (A Manifesto Addressed to the People of Canada by the Constitutional Committee for Reform and Progress), where he supported the ideas of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Notably, while on a trip to the U.S. he met Ulysses S. Grant, where they discussed the possibility of a union between Canada and the United States. Aubin was married to Marie Luce Emilie in 1841, and had a son, Eug√©nie Aubin, who was born in 1853. In 1866, Aubin returned to Montreal in 1866, where he became a member of the Canadian Institute of Montreal in 1869. From 1875 until his death in 1890, he served as Honorary Consul to Switzerland in Montreal. A Calvinist by faith, his funeral was conducted by a Presbyterian minister.

Hill was the son of Roger Hill of Poundisford and his wife Mary Hassard of Lyme Regis and became an ironmonger. With Dennis Bond he was made a constable of Dorchester in 1618. On 11 September 1621 he was appointed the first Governor of the Company of Freemen. Later he replaced John Yeate as an Alderman of Dorchester and a week later was appointed a Capital Burgess. He was an enthusiastic supporter of John White's schemes to create a godly community. In 1624 he invested in the Dorchester Company and was a member of a circle known as the New England Parliament which met in the Free School in Dorchester. In October 1624 he was elected Bailiff.Michael Russell John Hill (1569-1657) In 1628, Hill was elected Member of Parliament for Dorchester and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In 1631 he was elected steward of the Seaton Parsonage where he was responsible for holding funds and for collecting tithes. He was elected treasurer of the county at the Quarter Sessions in Sherborne on 30 April 1633. In 1636 he was elected Mayor of Dorchester. During this time he owned several privateers. He held the Seaton Stewardship until 1642 at the start of the Civil War. In 1643, when Dorchester was threatened by the Royalists, Hill and other merchants in the town tried to send their goods to safety by ship from Weymouth, but it was captured. Nevertheless, the war presented opportunities to make money and among other things he sold provisions to the besiegers of Sherborne. He appears to have left Dorchester during the war and moved to London. Hill died before 4 January 1658 when his will was proved in London. He left ¬£100 for an endowment known as the Hill Exhibition to support a poor scholar from Dorchester at one of the universities. Hill had married in about 1617 Sarah Davidge, widow of Thomas Davidge, merchant of Dorchester, and daughter of John Green merchant of Dorchester. They had at least a son and two daughters.

The recording was first released as a promo in 1978, but remained largely unheard until its release in 1998 with the reissue of the band's self-titled debut album. The recording \\"gives some indication of the public's reaction to this confrontational duo in their heyday\\".1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2008 Edition)-Dimmery, Robert Page 386 Recording A friend of the band, Howard Thompson, recorded the performance on cassette tape, and it was later released as a flexi-disc insert for a music magazine.http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/641/ Recording notes In 2000, while Mute Records was rereleasing Suicide's catalog, the tape was remastered and included as a bonus track for their first album. The entire performance is mixed as a single track. History Before Suicide even starts playing, booing can be heard from the crowd indicating that they wanted to hear the main act, Elvis Costello, straight away. Suicide is introduced and begins to play \\"Ghost Rider\\". Once it ends, there is booing from the crowd. The second song is \\"Rocket U.S.A\\". After that, at roughly 9:30, the audience can be heard chanting \\"ELVIS! ELVIS!\\". This attitude continues through the third and fourth songs, \\"Cheree\\" and \\"Dance\\". The audience becomes more active during the performance of \\"Frankie Teardrop\\". At roughly 19:30, loud applause can be heard; someone steals Alan Vega's microphone (a woman at 20:35 can be heard saying \\"They took the mic\\"). Shortly afterwards, the music stops and the promoter comes on, warning the audience that if they don't give the microphone back, there will be \\"no show\\". Vega joins in, swearing at the audience. After receiving the microphone, he continues to sing \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" a cappella. After even more booing, Vega shouts \\"SHUT THE FUCK UP! THIS IS ABOUT FRANKIE!\\". A few moments later, there is rapturous applause as the band leaves the stage. Later, Elvis Costello played a very short and angry set in which he made no secret of his outrage over Suicide's treatment by the crowd. This incited a riot. The show was cancelled and Vega's nose was broken. The story is detailed in the liner notes of the 2000 re-release. Recognition Suicide would only become famous after the peak of their activity was over. During the 1980s and 90s, they were responsible for influencing many bands and shaping genres such as industrial music, dance music and notably electroclash. This performance has been called \\"a record of proof of an innovative band‚Äôs struggle with an unreceptive audience\\" and has been compared to the audience's reactions to Dylan going electric. It also \\"clearly demonstrates two individuals flying in the face of convention, screaming their guts out to be heard, and failing to make a poignant imprint on the listening audience\\". Allmusic said that \\"though the (reissues) extra tracks dilute the original album's impact somewhat, they're worthwhile supplements to one of the punk era's most startlingly unique works\\". In review of their debut album for 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, Chris Shade called it a \\"riotous comedy\\", and noted that \\"(their) lack of rock 'n' roll accoutrements such as a drummer or guitarist often aroused violent reactions in their bewildered audiences\\".

He was a trusted aide of Later Liang's founding emperor Emperor Taizu (Zhu Quanzhong) before the founding of the Later Liang state, and later served as the director of imperial governance (Â¥áÊîø‰Ωø, Chongzhengshi) during the reigns of Emperor Taizu's sons and successors Zhu Yougui and Zhu Zhen. After Later Liang was destroyed by its rival Later Tang, Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong put Li to death.  Background  It is not known when Li Zhen was born. It is known that he was a great-grandson of the mid-Tang general Li Baozhen, and that his grandfather and father, whose names were lost to history, were both prefectural prefects. Li Zhen had submitted himself for imperial examinations in the Jinshi class several times during Emperor Yizong's Xiantong era (860-874) and Emperor Xizong's Qianfu era (874-879), but was unable to pass, and therefore developed a hatred for those officials who passed the Jinshi examinations. He was eventually able to obtain a commission as a general of the imperial guards, and was later commissioned as the prefect of Tai Prefecture (Ëá∫Â∑û, in modern Taizhou, Zhejiang). However, when he was reporting to the prefecture, the prefecture had become overrun by agrarian rebels, and he was unable to take office.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 18. As he headed back toward the imperial capital Chang'an, he went through Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, in modern Kaifeng, Henan), the capital of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶). He offered strategical advice to Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu; Zhu was impressed, and therefore kept Li at Xuanwu as an assistant to himself.Zhu Quanzhong started his service as the military governor of Xuanwu in 883; therefore, Li Zhen's rendezvous with him must have been later than this point. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255.  Service under Zhu Quanzhong   During Tang  In 898, after Zhu Quanzhong, who was then military governor of not only Xuanwu but also Xuanyi Circuit (ÂÆ£Áæ©, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), had further expanded his territory by conquering Tianping (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Taining (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) Circuits, he sent his deputy military governor Wei Zhen (ÈüãÈúá) to Chang'an to request that Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) make him the military governor of Tianping as well. The imperial government, after initial reservations, did so after much lobbying by Wei. Zhu subsequently made Wei the acting military governor and Li Zhen the deputy military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 900, the powerful eunuchs, led by Liu Jishu, overthrew Emperor Zhaozong and put him under arrest, replacing him with his son Li Yu, Prince of De. Liu sent his adoptive son Liu Xidu (ÂäâÂ∏åÂ∫¶) and another eunuch, Li Fengben (ÊùéÂ•âÊú¨), to Bian Prefecture to try to persuade Zhu to support the eunuchs' coup, promising to let him control the imperial court if he did so. Zhu was unsure what to do, and most of his staff members suggested not getting involved with the politics at the imperial court. Li Zhen, however, urged intervention against the eunuchs, pointing out that this was a good opportunity for Zhu to raise his profile among the regional governors, and further pointing out that if the young emperor became firmly in control of the eunuchs, the eunuchs could easily do what they wanted. Zhu agreed, and put Liu Xidu and Li Fengben under arrest, while sending Li Zhen to Chang'an to personally meet with the anti- eunuch chancellor Cui Yin, who was an ally of Zhu's, to consider what to do next. When, shortly thereafter, a countercoup by several Shence Army officers killed Liu Jishu and his coconspirators and restored Emperor Zhaozong, Zhu, who then executed Liu Xidu and Li Fengben, became even more attentive to Li Zhen's advice.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. By 904, Zhu had Emperor Zhaozong in his firm control and had forcibly moved the emperor from Chang'an to Luoyang. However, he was still apprehensive that the emperor might coordinate his actions with several other warlords who did not obey him‚ÄîLi Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Li Jihui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Liu Rengong the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and Zhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (Âø†Áæ©, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei). He therefore resolved to assassinate the emperor, and therefore sent Li Zhen to Luoyang to coordinate this matter with Jiang Xuanhui (Ëî£ÁéÑÊöâ) the director of palace communications (whom Zhu had put in charge of monitoring the emperor), as well as his adoptive son Zhu Yougong (Êú±ÂèãÊÅ≠) and officer Shi Shucong (Ê∞èÂèîÁêÆ). Zhu Yougong and Shi subsequently assassinated Emperor Zhaozong, who was then replaced with his son Emperor Ai. While Zhu Quanzhong subsequently ordered Zhu Yougong and Shi to commit suicide in order to divert responsibility, no harm came to Li Zhen or Jiang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. In 905, Zhu made Li Zhen the acting military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), to replace Wang Shifan, who had previously launched a resistance campaign against Zhu but who had subsequently submitted to Zhu. When Wang received the order, he feared that Zhu would bear past grudges against him, and begged Li Zhen to have at least his family spared. Li Zhen alleviated Wang's fears by citing the example of how Cao Cao had spared Zhang Xiu, and Wang subsequently went to Bian Prefecture along with his family. Zhu soon recalled Li Zhen himself back to Bian Prefecture. Later in 905, as Zhu was planning on seizing the throne soon, Zhu's ally, the chancellor Liu Can, advocated a mass purge of high-level Tang aristocrats, a proposal that Li Zhen also supported, as Li Zhen still hated these aristocrats, whose careers were largely launched from passing the Jinshi examinations. Zhu therefore had a group of some 30 high-level Tang aristocrats gathered at Baima Station (ÁôΩÈ¶¨È©õ, in modern Anyang), and then forced them to commit suicide. The victims included former chancellors Pei Shu, Dugu Sun, Cui Yuan, Lu Yi, Wang Pu, as well as the prominent officials Zhao Chong (Ë∂ôÂ¥á) and Wang Zan (ÁéãË¥ä). Further, at Li Zhen's suggestion‚Äîarguing that these aristocrats had considered themselves clean in their origin (i.e., qingliu (Ê∏ÖÊµÅ), literally \\"clear flow\\"), they should be thrown into the muddy waters of the Yellow River to taint them‚ÄîZhu had their bodies thrown into the Yellow River. (During the purge, because Li Zhen was acting arrogantly toward Tang officials at Luoyang, and it was said that every time that he went from Bian Prefecture to Luoyang, some officials would always get exiled or executed, he became known by the nickname of Chixiao (È¥üÊ¢ü)‚Äîa mythical one-head, three-bodied bird.)  During Later Liang  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang Dynasty and establishing a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Li Zhen was thereafter made the director of palace affairs (ÊÆø‰∏≠Áõ£, Dianzhong Jian). Shortly after, it was at his and Jing Xiang's suggestion that the Tang official Su Xun (ËòáÂæ™), who had submitted petitions in support of the dynastic transition, be forced to retire as a traitor to Tang. Li was later made the minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu). In 911, when Later Liang's Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) was under attack by Li Cunxu, the prince of Later Liang's enemy state Jin to the north, Emperor Taizu was concerned that Tianxiong's young military governor, Luo Zhouhan (who had inherited the governorship from his father Luo Shaowei), would not have the ability to stand against a Jin attack, and therefore sent the general Du Tingyin (ÊùúÂª∑Èö±) to assist Luo in the defense and Li Zhen to serve as Luo's deputy military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. (It did not appear that Li Zhen remained long at Tianxiong, however, based on subsequent events.)  Service under Zhu Yougui and Zhu Zhen  In 912, Emperor Taizu's son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying assassinated Emperor Taizu (who was then at Luoyang), blamed the assassination on his adoptive older brother Zhu Youwen the Prince of Bo and had Zhu Youwen executed, and then took the throne himself. Apprehensive about Jing Xiang, who was then the director of imperial governance and whose office was within the palace, as Jing was a close associate of Emperor Taizu's, Zhu Yougui gave Jing what appeared to be a promotion ‚Äî to chancellorship ‚Äî to remove him from the director of imperial governance position and remove his presence from the palace. Li Zhen was made the director of imperial governance.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. In 913, Zhu Yougui's younger brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun, who was then at Daliang (i.e., Bian Prefecture), prepared a coup against Zhu Yougui. Before he could launch it, however, his cousin Yuan Xiangxian (a son of Emperor Taiizu's sister), an imperial guard general, launched a coup and had Zhu Yougui's palace surrounded. Zhu Yougui committed suicide. During this coup, many Later Liang officials were killed or injured, and Li was one of the ones injured. Subsequently, Yuan offered the throne to Zhu Youzhen, who accepted it at Daliang, and subsequently changed his name to Zhu Zhen. While Li continued to serve as the director of imperial governance, neither he nor Jing was listened to much by Zhu Zhen, even though nominally they were the most honored officials of the state. Instead, Zhu Zhen mostly listened to the advice of Zhao Yan, the husband of one of his sisters, as well as his wife Consort Zhang's brothers Zhang Handing (ÂºµÊº¢Èºé) and Zhang Hanjie (ÂºµÊº¢ÂÇë) and cousins Zhang Hanlun (ÂºµÊº¢ÂÄ´) and Zhang Hanrong (ÂºµÊº¢Ëûç). As a result, Li often claimed to be ill to avoid policy meetings and avoid arguments with Zhao and the Zhangs.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 923, Li Cunxu, whose Jin state by that point controlled nearly all of the territory north of the Yellow River, claimed imperial title as well, establishing a new Later Tang as its Emperor Zhuangzong. The two states were gearing up for a major confrontation on the battlefield, and Zhu Zhen put the general Duan Ning in command of the Later Liang army, against Jing's and Li's advice and against their subsequent requests to replace him. (It was said that Zhu Zhen stated to Li, \\"Duan Ning has not committed an error,\\" and Li responded, \\"When he does so, the empire would already be in danger.\\") As Duan prepared an ambitious four-prong attack against Later Tang, the new Later Tang emperor bypassed him, crossed the Yellow River, and headed toward Daliang directly. With Daliang defenseless (because all the soldiers had been given to Duan in anticipation for the attack against Later Tang), Zhu Zhen panicked and committed suicide, ending Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272.  Death  Upon Emperor Zhuangzong's arrival at Daliang, he issued an edict generally pardoning the Later Liang officials. Hearing of the edict, Li Zhen went to see Jing Xiang and suggested that they go see Emperor Zhuangzong together to beg for pardon. Jing responded, \\"Both of us were Liang chancellors. We could not correct the emperor's poor governance, and we could not save the dynasty from destruction. If the new emperor questions us on these grounds, how are we going to respond?\\" The next morning, Jing's servants informed him that Li Zhen had already gone to the palace. Jing sighed and stated, \\"Li Zhen is no man. The Zhus and the new emperor have been enemies for generations. Now, the empire has been destroyed, and the emperor is dead. Even if the new emperor would spare us, how can we still enter the Jianguo Gate [(Âª∫ÂúãÈñÄ, the gate to the Later Liang imperial palace)]?\\" He therefore hanged himself. Within a few days, Emperor Zhuangzong, at the instigation of Duan Ning and another former Later Liang general, Du Yanqiu, issued another edict which, while generally confirming the pardon, ordered that Jing (whose death he apparently did not know), Li, Zhao, the Zhangs, the Later Liang general Zhu Gui (Êú±Áè™), and the Khitan prince Yel√º Sala'abo (ËÄ∂ÂæãÊííÂâåÈòøÊí•) (the brother of the Khitan emperor Emperor Taizu of Liao, who had previously rebelled against the Khitan emperor and fled to Emperor Zhuangzong, and then re-defected to Later Liang) be put to death, along with their families.

The organization was founded on April 15, 1855, as a federation of parish mutual aid societies. Although the German Catholic community had a strong reputation for conservatism, the Verein had taken the lead, by 1900, as the most reform- oriented of American Catholic societies, under the leadership of Nicholas Gonner of Milwaukee (1890-1903) and Frederick P. Kenkel (1908-1952).Philip Gleason, The conservative reformers: German-American Catholics and the social order (1968). Today, its headquarters are located in St. Louis, Missouri, and its primary mission is the publication of the Social Justice Review, a journal founded in 1908 to promote Christian humanism with respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings. Founding The Catholic Central Verein of America was founded in 1855 as the German Roman Catholic Central Society of North America (Deutsche R√∂misch-Katholische Central-Verein von Nord Amerika). It began as a central alliance of German Catholic organizations from all over the United States that was established at a founding Convention in Baltimore, Maryland. Annual conventions have been held in cities around the country since 1855. Publications In 1908, the Central Bureau was established in St. Louis, Missouri, to co-ordinate the activities of the Central Verein. The same year, a monthly magazine, the Central-Blatt and Social Justice, began to be published in St. Louis. Its first editor was Dr. Frederick Philip Kenkel, who had been editor of the German-language Amerika in St. Louis. The journal was intended to promote Christian humanism, with respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings. It continues today as the bimonthly Social Justice Review, under the editorship of the Reverend Edward Krause, C.S.C., now the Director of the Central Bureau. The philosophical roots of the journal and its parent organization are to be located in the German Romantic tradition of such thinkers as Johann Josef von G√∂rres (1776-1848), as well as in the solidarist economics of the Jesuit Heinrich Pesch (1854-1926). Pesch's ideas were highly influential in the background of Pope Pius VI's famous social encyclical, Quadragesimo Anno, and in later papal documents. GK Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc's distributist economic theories have also been well-received by the writers who appear in Social Justice Review. Activities The purpose of the Central Verein has always been the promotion of Catholic practice, Christian virtue, and works of charity; spreading the knowledge and love of God; and helping to effect a Christian reconstruction of society that is based on the principles of the great papal social encyclicals of the 19th century and later. Among the noteworthy achievements of the Central Verein have been its successful support of laws enabling credit unions, establishing workmen's compensation, and permitting public school buses to transport Catholic schoolchildren. During and after the Second World War, the Central Bureau of the Central Verein served until the 1950s as the official agency of the Archdiocese of St. Louis for resettling refugees and displaced persons from Europe and other places. In more recent years, the Central Bureau has conducted humanitarian aid work in Central America. No longer a specifically- German society, the Central Verein and its Central Bureau have adapted their outlook and activities for the good of people of all ethnic backgrounds. The decline in membership of German ethnic organizations in the United States has left the publication of the Social Justice Review as the Central Bureau's main activity. It also maintains a library at its headquarters in St. Louis, mainly devoted to the social sciences and German-Americana, publications in German in the United States. In the 21st century, most of the annual meetings of the Central Verein have been held at the Central Bureau. References Sources * Brophy, Mary Liguori.

Tyldesley filmed her final scenes on 20 June 2018 which were broadcast on 3 August 2018. Eva moves into The Rovers Return Inn with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, Karl Munro (John Michie). Tyldesley later said in May 2012 that Eva's glamorous lifestyle can be \\"straining\\" and enjoys time off work to wear normal and more comfortable clothes. Kate White of Inside Soap praised the character while a writer for the Daily Mirror nicknamed the character \\"Eva The Diva\\". Eva was described as being \\"feisty.\\" Tyldesley revealed more about her character, saying: \\"Eva is a little bit of a princess! She's been spoiled rotten, so she's somewhat high maintenance and a little bit of a drama queen. She's definitely used to getting her own way.\\" Laura Armstrong from The People described Eva as a \\"fit barmaid\\" and later added that \\"her shifts at Nick's Bistro seem like a stroll in a Manchester park\\". Storylines In June 2011, Stella Price's (Michelle Collins) daughter, Eva, arrives and announces that the wedding is off. Under pressure from Stella, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) agrees she can stay and Stella tells Eva that she has a home at The Rovers for as long as she needs it. When Eva is rude to Leanne Barlow (Jane Danson), Stella is quick to apologise and forces Eva to do the same, Eva later learns that Leanne is her half-sister. Stella and Eva are unimpressed as they clear up the debris from Becky McDonald's (Katherine Kelly) lock-in the night before. Eva gets a job in Nick Tilsley's (Ben Price) Bistro and they start dating. Eva misunderstands a conversation with Nick about moving out, so she begins looking at flats for them. Nick later tells her that it is too soon for them to live together. Eva plans a speed dating night at the Bistro, which ends when Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) pushes her date into the fire alarm. Luckily for Eileen, she is asked out by a fireman, Paul Kershaw (Tony Hirst). Nick and Eva continue dating but Stella warns Eva that Nick may break her heart. Nick finds Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) in a strip club and helps by booking a hotel room for the night as she cannot collect her son, Max, until the morning. When the pair return the next day, Eva finds a receipt from the hotel. Upon reading a text from Kylie, thanking him for the previous night, Eva announces publicly that Nick is cheating on her after ruining a big occasion in the Bistro and costing him a lot of business. Nick proves her wrong and dumps Eva for doubting him but allows to keep her job. She later goes on a date with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to make Nick jealous. She believes that he is still interested but learns that he is in love with Leanne. The sisters have a vicious row and Leanne leaves The Rovers. Eva suspects Stella's boyfriend Karl Munro (John Michie) is having an affair with Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati), and warns them that she knows what is going on.

When the health inspector arrives, Eva and Sunita distract him and The Rovers passes. Eva's suspicions are confirmed when returning from a night out with Stella and Leanne, they catch Karl and Sunita together. Eva begins dating Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis). The couple separate briefly but reconcile after Rob tries flirting with Stella but Eva suspects that Rob is cheating on her with Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Eva and Michelle's boyfriend, Steve, visit the hotel that they are staying in on a business trip and finds Rob with a waitress at the hotel, not Michelle. The couple split up and Eva sets her sights on her ex-boyfriend, Nick. Eva and Kylie, who also dislikes Leanne, plan to split Nick and Leanne up by getting Nick to propose, the day after her divorce from Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) has come through. Unfortunately for Eva, Leanne accepts. After Peter returns from Los Angeles, Eva makes a false booking at the Bistro, so Nick misses Simon Barlow's (Alex Bain) nativity play. He becomes paranoid about Peter and Leanne, causing an argument between him and Leanne after he has a fight with Peter at the school. On Christmas Day, Eva is Leanne's bridesmaid.

Creation and casting Catherine Tyldesley (pictured) was cast as Eva in May 2011 and made her first on-screen appearance on 17 June 2011.On 4 May 2011, it was revealed that Tyldesley had been cast in the role of Eva. This was Tyldesley's second role in Coronation Street, having previously played a minor role as a maternity nurse that helped deliver Dev and Sunita Alahan's twins in January 2006. The actress, who has previously appeared in Emmerdale and Lilies, began filming her first scenes that month. During an interview with Digital Spy, Tyldesley revealed that there had been a lot of competition for the role of Eva and that she felt \\"incredibly lucky\\" to have secured the part. Tyldesley said she felt \\"nervous\\" when she first arrived on set. Speaking to What's on TV, she said that she had a \\"mini freak out\\" when filming her first scenes in The Rovers. Tyldesley added that Coronation Street is \\"absolutely legendary\\" and is thrilled to be a part of the cast. After impressing producers, it was later confirmed that Tyldesley was to be kept on as a permanent member of the cast. After signing a new six-month contract, an executive said that Eva will be involved in some \\"cracking\\" storylines towards the end of the year. In May 2012, Tyldesley expressed her desire for a long- term stint on the show. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Tyldesley said \\"I've always wanted to be in Corrie. So when I got the phone call to tell me that I'd got the part, I was thrilled to bits.\\" She also added that Eva has got \\"so much scope\\". Development Characterisation Before she appeared on screen, Eva was described as being \\"feisty.\\" Tyldesley revealed more about her character, saying \\"Eva is a little bit of a princess! She's been spoiled rotten, so she's somewhat high maintenance and a little bit of a drama queen. She's definitely used to getting her own way.\\" The actress said her character adores her mother and they share a great relationship. When Eva enters the show, her circumstances force her to be more angry than she normally is. Tyldesley said that Eva does have a softer side, which she believed viewers would see in the future. When asked why Eva and Karl do not get along, Tyldesley said \\"I think it's because they're both quite similar. When Eva first joins the street, she's had a little bit of turmoil with past relationships and things like that, so I think she feels like she wants to be quite selfish at the moment, which annoys Karl. But she's always been full of self-importance because she's always been spoiled - she's not known any different.\\" Tyldesley revealed that Eva is not a lesbian character, despite a newspaper report, and that she definitely loves the boys. When asked about Eva's type, Tyldesley said that they would have to be \\"on her wavelength\\" as Eva gets bored and frustrated with people who are not on her level. In May 2012, Tyldesley commented that Eva's glamorous lifestyle can be \\"straining\\" and she enjoys time off work so she can wear normal and more comfortable clothes. Tyldesley admitted in June 2012 that men do not approach her outside of the show and blamed her character for putting other men off. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Tyldesley said: \\"I'm so disillusioned with men at the moment. Possibly men are intimidated by my screen character, I don't know. I've been single for a while. I've been on a couple of dates, but it's been quite a long time now.\\" In an interview with Digital Spy in June 2017, Tyldesley expressed interest in Eva's father being introduced into the show, she said: \\"He walked out when she was three. She's spoken about that in previous episodes, saying he just packed his bags and went. That's something I've always thought I'd love Corrie to do, to bring him in. So I hope they do bring in Eva's dad, because he has a lot to answer for. There were few details about why he walked out, as Stella said very little about it.\\" She also expressed interest in Michelle Collins reprising her role as Eva's mother Stella. Friendship with Kylie Platt Paula Lane revealed that Eva will start a friendship with Kylie Platt. Lane said Eva would feature in \\"lighter\\" storylines with Kylie and that viewers will see a happy side to Kylie as Eva \\"becomes her sidekick\\". She also added that herself and Tyldesley are a \\"nightmare\\" on set saying that they \\"laugh a lot\\". Relationship with Nick Tilsley It was announced in late 2011 that Eva is to start a relationship with Nick Tilsley. Ben Price hinted that Eva and Nick are made for each other. Speaking to Inside Soap, asked whether who would be good for Nick, Price replied: \\"Maybe Eva. I think she'd be perfect for him - she's intelligent, feisty and Leanne's half-sister. After Natasha Blakeman, who was barmy and clingy, and then Leanne, which was complicated, Nick needs someone to give him a run for his money. That's what Becky can do and perhaps someone like Michelle - but not Fiz or Julie! It has to be someone who's going to have an intelligent argument with him, make him laugh and not take his nonsense.\\" Speaking to Soaplife, Tyldesley explains Eva's motions when Stella starts to show a significant amount of interest in Leanne. Tyldesley commented that Eva is Jealous that Leanne is married with a family because she split up from her fianc√© just weeks before finding out Leanne is her half-sister. She also added that Stella is Eva's \\"territory\\" but also \\"she treats Leanne as a sister and would consider Leanne with Nick a complete betrayal.\\" Tyldesley revealed in May 2012 that Nick will dump Eva in an upcoming episode after Eva accuses Nick of having an affair with Kylie. Speaking to All About Soap, she said that Eva likes a bit of drama and when Eva reveals to everyone in bistro that Nick is having an affair with Kylie and hinted that Eva goes too far. Tyldesley later added that Eva will fail to reconcile with Nick after she tries to \\"scheme\\" her way back into his affections. She explained that Eva hits rock bottom as she tries to cope without Nick in her life. She added: \\"She'd invested everything into the relationship and she's depressed and angry to say the least‚Ä¶ she's well and truly gutted.\\" After Eva's separation from Nick, Tyldesley said that she is keen for Eva to find some \\"fresh meat\\" and added that Eva will just \\"play with en\\" until the right person comes along. Tyldesley also claims that Eva is devastated by the loss of Nick and said that it will be sad not working with Ben Price as much. Tyldesley later predicted that Eva will \\"bounce back from her troubles\\". Speaking to Key 103, Tyldesley said: \\"They just keep throwing all these things at her - she's having a right time of it at the minute! But she's her mother's daughter, so I'm sure she'll get through it.\\" Relationship with Aidan Connor In July 2015, it was reported by the Mirror that Eva who was currently on a hiatus at the time due to Tyldesley's maternity leave, would embark on a relationship with newcomer Aidan Connor played by Shayne Ward upon her return to the street later in the year. Asked about talk of a new romance for Eva, Tyldesley said: \\"Possibly. Anything can happen.\\" Eva and Aidan later went on to begin a relationship with the two characters kissing at midnight on New Year's Eve. It was later announced that Eva and Aidan's relationship would soon become a love triangle with Aidan having a one-night stand with Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie), producer Kate Oates had previously spoken about the affair, saying: \\"No soap is complete without a good love triangle! We have got Aidan, who has had this one-night stand with Maria, and he's regretted it. Maria hasn't quite so much.\\" After their one-night stand, Maria decides to end her relationship with Luke Britton (Dean Fagan), which makes Aidan think she really is in love with him and will tell his Eva all about the fling. Aidan later invited Maria to spend the night with him at a hotel and she's thrilled until Aidan makes it clear he‚Äôs no intention of finishing with Eva. On 20 June 2017, it was revealed that Eva would discover that she's pregnant with Aidan's baby around the same time she discovers Aidan's affair with Maria. In an interview with Digital Spy, Tyldesley said: \\"If she'd found out she was pregnant a week previous, it would have been all she'd ever wanted. That was her goal ‚Äì to meet a Prince Charming, settle down and have a family, but now she's discovered this, it's even more heartbreaking. She can't even begin to get her head round the fact that she's pregnant.\\" Departure (2018) On 1 December 2017, Tyldesley announced that she had quit the role of Eva after portraying her for seven years. Speaking to The Sun about her departure, Tyldesley said \\"Coronation Street has been a dream job for me which is why this was such a difficult decision to leave. Eva has been such fun to play over the last seven years, and who knows, one day she might storm the cobbles of Weatherfield again. In the meantime I'm excited about the future, new acting projects, and spending time with my family.\\" It was also confirmed that an exit storyline has been devised for Eva and that she would be leaving in early summer 2018. A Coronation Street spokesperson said: 'We can confirm that Cath Tyldesley will leave Coronation Street at the end of her current contract next year after seven years in the show\\". She filmed her final scenes on 20 June 2018 and departed on-screen on 3 August 2018. Reception Kate White of Inside Soap praised the character, saying \\"Sexy, sassy and often a proper bitch, Eva's by far the most interesting girl in Weatherfield right now. She's got the makings of a classic Corrie woman. Think Karen, think Bet.\\" A writer for the Daily Mirror nicknamed the character \\"Eva The Diva\\", while another called Eva \\"snobby\\". Laura Armstrong from The People described Eva as a \\"fit barmaid\\" and later added that \\"her shifts at Nick's Bistro seem like a stroll in a Manchester park\\". Sue Crawford from the Daily Mirror branded Eva \\"ditzy\\". Paul Martinovic of Digital Spy called Eva a \\"maneater\\".

She made the viewer-voted shortlist for the \\"Sexiest Female\\" award, but lost out to Natalie J. Robb, who portrays Moira Dingle in Emmerdale.

Harvesting Mature trees are harvested from pine plantations and also from native forests. Trees harvested at a younger age can produce smaller logs, which can be turned into lower value products. Factors such as the site and climatic conditions, the species, the growth rate, and silviculture can affect the size of a mature tree.http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production- process/harvesting Timber mills The native hardwood sawmilling industry originally consisted of small family-owned mills, but this has recently changed to include a small number of larger mills. The mills produce large volumes of standard products, and aim to ensure a \\"standard quality of product, efficiently and safely, at low cost, with rapid production time and high output\\".http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood- production-process/timber-mills Uses Once the timber has manipulated in the required fashion, it can be used for its purpose. There are many different purposes for wood including: plywood, veneer, pulp, paper, particleboard, pallets, craft items, toys, instrument-making, furniture production, packing cases, wine barrels, cardboard, firewood, garden mulch, fibre adhesives, packaging and pet litter. Western Australia has a unique substance called ‚Äòbio-char‚Äô, which is made from jarrah and pine. Bio-char can be used in the manufacture of silicone and as a soil additive. Example of toys made of wood https://woodencaterpillar.com Productshttp://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production- process/products Hardwoods and softwoods Softwoods, such as the Australian eucalyptus, are highly valued, and are used mainly for construction, paper making, and cladding. The term \\"roundwood\\" describes all the wood that is removed from forests in log form and used for purposes other than fuel. Wood manufacturing residues, such as sawdust and chippings, are collectively known as \\"pulp\\".http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production- process/hardwood-softwood Changes in technology Originally, \\"trees were felled from native forests using axes and hand-held cross-cut saws\\". This was a slow process involving manual labour. Nowadays, harvesting is done by a small team of contractors, who are aided by various pieces of machinery. Sawmills were traditionally located within forests, so logs had to be transported over long distances and rough terrain to reach their destination. Soon, waterways were used to transport the logs. Later on, logs were transported via tramlines, \\"first by steam-powered log haulers then by steam- powered locomotives, and finally diesel and petrol-powered locomotives\\". Even in the modern era, timber is dried in kilns. The first steam railway in Australia opened in Melbourne in 1854. This dramatically changed the nature of timber transportation and made it possible for the sawmilling industry to move inland away from the coast, due to transportation being made quicker and cheaper.http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production- process/changing-technologies References Category:Wood products ","title":"Wood production"},{"id":"33954166","title":"PLBD1"},{"id":"33954179","text":"The Harmon's Covered Bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge located at Washington Township in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.

The special election was called after incumbent representative Antonio M. Diaz died on August 3, 2011. Jun Omar Ebdane, son of governor Hermogenes Ebdane, won in the special election, beating Cheryl Deloso-Montalla, Diaz's opponent in the 2010 general election, Rica Victoria Diaz-Arambulo, Diaz's daughter, and two other independent candidates. This was the closest special election in the 21st century in the Philippines. Background A member of the Magsaysay political family has served as member of the House of Representatives from Zambales since 1946 when Ramon Magsaysay was elected. Antonio M. Diaz, a nephew of Ramon Magsaysay, was first elected as representative in Zambales' lone district in 1969, serving until 1972 when Congress was dissolved, elected in 1984 in the Regular Batasang Pambansa, won three consecutive terms starting in 1992 for the 2nd District's seat, and another three consecutive terms starting in 2004. Diaz died on August 3, 2011 after being afflicted with pneumonia. With the seat's vacancy, the Zambales Provincial Board passed a resolution asking the House of Representatives and the Commission on Elections to call for a special election. The absence of a representative meant that the monetary incentives normally used by Diaz for scholarships was no longer given. By September, the resolution filed by the provincial board was at its second reading in the House of Representatives, and that the board passed another resolution asking Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. to appoint a liaison officer to the district coming from the province. Vice Governor Ramon Lacbain said that the board is expecting the special election to be held at October. By October, typhoons Pedring and Quiel ravaged the province; with no representative in Congress, the residents had no one to approach for help. The Commission on Elections released a statement on November 8 that expecting the special election to be held soon. On December, the commission announced that the special election would be held on February 4. The election period would start on December 21, 2011 and end on February 14, 2012, the filing of certificates of candidacy will be from January 16 to January 18, 2012, and the campaign period will be from January 19 to February 2, 2012. Campaign Names floated prior to the filing of certificates of candidacies include Rica Diaz, daughter of Diaz, Cheryl Deloso, daughter of former governor Amor Deloso, Jun Omar Ebdane, son of current governor Hermogenes Ebdane and incumbent provincial administrator, and board members Wilfredo Pangan and Alfred Mendoza. President Benigno Aquino III authorized the military and the police to implement election laws, such as a province-wide gun ban, during the election period. Jun Omar Ebdane resigned as provincial administrator on January 17 in order to run for the vacant seat. Ebdane was leading in election surveys, with 37% of the vote, followed closely by Deloso-Montalla and Diaz- Arambulo. Meanwhile, Diaz-Arambulo has succeeded in allowing her father's scholarships to continue while the seat was vacant, working with Belmonte, who was officer-in-charge of the vacant seat. The commission issued a warning on the Ebdane and Deloso-Montalla campaigns, saying that the posters used were too large than the legally-specified size. Ebdane's supporters took down huge billboards of him in Iba, while a few of Deloso-Montalla's posters were also removed. This comes as President Aquino declared February 4 as a special non- working holiday in the province to allow the electorate to vote. The commission expected a voter turnout of around 70%, while Diaz-Arambulo has complained of vote buying. On the eve of the election, a shootout between Zambales police and armed men took place at Botolan. It started when an informant called the police saying a group of armed men were harassing voters in barangay Mambog; a special reaction team of Botolan police went to the scene, but one of the gunmen named Cesar Mado opened fire to the police. The police returned fire, causing the death of Madu, a former policeman, and 10 more were injured. Governor Ebdane said that he will not interfere in the investigation, although a Philippine Star source stated that Madu was a former security officer of the Delosos. Results The Zambales board of canvassers started counting the votes on election night, but suspended its proceedings at around 10:00 pm to allow the election returns to arrive. The session resumed on morning the next day. The board finished its tally by 10:00 am but the documentation took more than hour to be finished; the board proclaimed Ebdane as the winner by 11:15 am. Ebdane won in seven municipalities, while Deloso- Montalla won Santa Cruz and San Narciso, and Diaz-Arambulo won narrowly in San Antonio. The Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting, while noting the low turnout was due to voters residing in other areas of the country not returning to the district to vote, was dismayed by the rampant vote-buying. Deloso-Montalla defeated Ebdane in the 2013 general election. 2010 election result See also *1911 Zambales's congressional district special election *1914 Zambales's congressional district special election References External links *COMELEC Resolution No. 9304 Category:2012 elections in the Philippines Category:Special elections to the Congress of the Philippines Category:Elections in Zambales ","title":"2012 Zambales's 2nd congressional district special election"},{"id":"33954219","title":"Helen A.

Protesters delay foreclosures by camping out on the foreclosed property. They also stage protests at the banks responsible for the ongoing foreclosure crisis, sometimes blocking their entrances. It has been compared to the direct action taken by people to prevent home foreclosures during the Great Depression in the United States. History The late-2000s financial crisis resulted in the collapse of some large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments, and downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in numerous evictions and foreclosures; in the U.S., 3.6 million homes have been foreclosed since August 2007. In 2008, a federal law termed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was passed to spend 700 billion dollars to bail out banks. The law also specifically called for the government to encourage banks to modify loans to prevent foreclosures. However, very little money has actually been used to bail out home owners and the banks have done little to change their lending practices to help people to avoid losing their homes. The Occupy Homes movement has its roots in the early 1970s, when declining working-class incomes and a lack of bank financing for low-rent properties left thousands of New York City buildings abandoned and hundreds of former tenants squatted vacant buildings on Manhattan's Upper West Side, East Harlem, Chelsea, Chinatown, the Lower East Side, and the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. A similar group based in Miami, Florida, Take Back the Land, has been working to block evictions, and rehousing homeless people in foreclosed houses since 2007. Early successful actions included the delay of an eviction of a woman in Ohio when protesters camped out in her yard, Maddow, Rachel; Leitsinger, Miranda. ‚ÄúForeclosed homes, empty lots are new ‚ÄòOccupy‚Äô targets‚Äù, MSNBC, December 2, 2011 (phrase \\"Occupy Our Homes\\" presented at 7:04) convincing Fannie Mae to hold off on an eviction by holding a vigil outside a home in California,Hartmann, Thom.From Occupy Wall Street To Occupy The Living Room, The Talk Radio News Service, November 14, 2011. delaying a foreclosure in Minnesota so that an occupant could first move out of a home, and convincing a New York landlord to provide adequate heating to tenants by occupying a boiler room. National Day of Action On December 6, 2011, Occupy Our Homes, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, said it was embarking on a \\"National Day of Action\\" to protest the mistreatment of homeowners by big banks, who they say made billions of dollars off of the housing bubble by offering predatory loans and indulging in practices that took advantage of consumers. In more than two dozen cities across the nation the movement took on the housing crisis by re-occupying foreclosed homes, disrupting bank auctions and blocking evictions. Saying, \\"The banks got bailed out, but our families are getting kicked out\\", Occupy Wall Street joined in solidarity with a Brooklyn community to occupy homes that were foreclosed and are now owned by banks. A peaceful group of more than 500 staged what it termed \\"a National Day of Action\\" to fight fraudulent lending practices and \\"illegal evictions by banks\\" ‚Äî the institutions Occupiers blame for the nation's economic predicament. Occupy Wall Street said there would be similar occupations in other communities and that they also will try to disrupt auctions at which foreclosed properties are sold. There were also similar occupations in Atlanta, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon. In Minneapolis, a nonprofit group, Minnesota's Neighborhoods Organizing for Change, has joined with Occupy Minneapolis protesters to live on the properties of two foreclosed homeowners. On December 6, about 50 people began occupying the home of an unemployed man who faces eviction after several heart attacks and shoulder surgery that prevented him from working at his former job as an independent contractor. A spokesperson for Neighborhoods Organizing for Change said, \\"Foreclosure in his case made no sense. His mortgage balance was $275,000 but the auction of his home only fetched $80,000, less than one-third of the amount he owed. Everybody, including the bank, would have been better off reducing his balance to an affordable level.\\" In Atlanta, Occupy Our Homes activists went to the courthouses in three of the area's largest counties to disrupt the foreclosure auctions happening there. The group is demanding an immediate moratorium on all foreclosures. In Chicago, activists took over homes left vacant due to foreclosures. They moved a homeless mother and child, an evicted homeowner and a college student into one of the houses which had been abandoned by its owner in April and was severely vandalized. Calling the December 6 demonstrations and actions just a \\"warm-up\\" for actions of the next few months, Max Rameau, a housing activist with Take Back the Land, one of the organizations that has aligned itself with the Occupy Our Homes movement, said, \\"This is an important practice round for our 2012 spring offensive\\". Continuing actions On December 6, 2011, members of Occupy Atlanta began an occupation of the home of Brigitte Walker, a former Army Staff Sergeant who was medically discharged in 2007. Unable to keep up with payments on her reduced salary, her home was scheduled to be auctioned off on January 3. At a press conference on December 20, it was announced by members of Occupy Atlanta and State Senator Vincent Fort, who Walker had contacted for aid, that they had successfully renegotiated her loan to a monthly payment she could afford that would allow her to stay in her home. By late December hundreds of other foreclosure victims were being defended by local branches of the Occupy movement. Reaction Conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart said the movement's new focus is \\"fomenting civil unrest, fomenting class warfare\\" and that this action shows that Occupy Wall Street is not \\"an authentic grass- roots movement but a political maneuver backed by organized labor and remnants of the ACORN community-organizing group aimed at boosting President Obama's re-election campaign\\". Speaking on CNN, law professors Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Pe√±alver compared the occupation of foreclosed homes to earlier social protests that brought about positive legal change. In their opinion, the Occupy Homes movement demonstrates an obvious connection between the Occupy Wall Street protestor's disobedience (the occupation of parks and streets) and their complaints of economic inequality, political corruption and the excessive power of banks. They point out that the financial institutions that brought about the current recession, often using illegal procedures such as robo-signing, now own the very homes that were lost due to their illegal practices and they believe that Occupy Homes forms a tighter link between its acts of occupation and its political objections. New York writer, filmmaker, and Occupier Astra Taylor wrote: > Not only does the occupation of abandoned foreclosed homes connect the dots > between Wall Street and Main Street, it can also lead to swift and tangible > victories, something movements desperately need for momentum to be > maintained.

The eardrum comprises two parts, the pars tensa, which is the main part of the eardrum, and the pars flaccida, which is a smaller part of the eardrum located above the pars tensa. Either or both of these parts may become retracted. The retracted segment of eardrum is often known as a retraction pocket. The terms \\"atelectasis\\" or sometimes \\"adhesive otitis media\\" can be used to describe retraction of a large area of the pars tensa. Tympanic membrane retraction is fairly common and has been observed in one quarter of a population of British school children. Retraction of both eardrums is less common than having a retraction in just one ear. It is more common in children with cleft palate. Tympanic membrane retraction also occurs in adults. Attempts have been made to categorise the extent of tympanic membrane retraction though the validity of these classifications is limited.  Presentation  The majority of tympanic membrane retractions do not cause any symptoms. Some cause hearing loss by restricting sound-induced vibrations of the eardrum. Permanent conductive hearing loss can be caused by erosion of the ossicles (hearing bones). Discharge from the ear often indicates that the retraction pocket has developed into a cholesteatoma.  Pathogenesis  Three factors must occur for the tympanic membrane to become retracted:  Negative middle ear pressure  When gas pressure within the middle ear is less than atmospheric pressure, the eardrum can become sucked into the middle ear space. This may be caused by disrupted gas exchange in the middle ear mucosa, inadequate opening of the Eustachian tube or a combination of these factors. People with a patulous Eustachian tube may also cause negative middle ear pressure by repeatedly sniffing to try to keep their Eustachian tube closed.  Weakness of the tympanic membrane  The middle layer of the pars tensa is strengthened by fibres of collagen protein. This layer may be weaker in the postero-superior quadrant (top rear quarter) or after the eardrum heals after perforation or tympanostomy tubes (grommets) so predispose to retraction in these areas. The pars flaccida is prone to retraction as it does not contain the same stiffening layer of collagen.  Increase in surface area of the tympanic membrane  All over the body, new skin cells are continually produced to replace old skin cells which dry out and slough off. Growth of new cells on the surface of the eardrum is unusual in that the new cells migrate over the surface and move out along the ear canal. Even if migration along the ear canal is blocked, new cells continue to grow so the surface of the eardrum becomes larger. This process of proliferation and migration can result in enlargement of a retraction pocket so that the eardrum expands and grows deeper into the ear.  Natural history  The majority of tympanic membrane retractions remain stable for long periods of time, or may even resolve spontaneously so that eardrum becomes normal again. Not all retractions are able to resolve even if middle ear pressure normalizes, as the retracted segment may become adherent to other structures within the middle ear. Some retractions continue to progress and grow more deeply into the ear. This can result in erosion of bone and cholesteatoma formation. Asymptomatic deep pars tensa retractions tend to remain stable in adults. However, beahviour of symptomatic pars tensa retractions significantly differ between children and adults. There is a likelihood that such ears in children will recover spontaneously. There is no simple clinical means of identifying which ears will deteriorate to accumulate keratin debris in the pars tensa retraction, a phenomenon that is not influenced by age. In children, the pars tensa retraction may remain unchanged while the pars flaccida deteriorates to form cholesteatoma.  Bone erosion  As the middle ear is only a narrow space, the eardrum only has to retract a short distance before it touches boney structures within the middle ear such as the ossicles. It may become adherent to these bones and in some cases, this contact leads to erosion of the bone. As well as ossicular erosion, the bone of the ear canal (e.g. the scutum) and even bone over the cochlea (the promontory) can become eroded.  Keratin entrapment  As skin cells die they form a barrier of dry protein called keratin. This layer of keratin is normally pushed out of the ear by migration of skin cells along the ear canal and is turned into wax. Clearance of keratin can be disrupted by tympanic membrane retraction so that keratin accumulates within the retraction pocket. When keratin becomes trapped deep inside the ear and cannot be cleaned out, it is known as cholesteatoma. Growth of bacteria in the trapped keratin causes smelly discharge from the ear and can spread to cause serious infection.  Treatment  Various strategies may be used to manage tympanic membrane retraction, with the aims of preventing or relieving hearing loss and cholesteatoma formation.  Observation  As retraction pockets may remain stable or resolve spontaneously, it may be appropriate to observe them for a period of time before considering any active treatment.  Increase middle ear pressure  The Valsalva maneuver increases middle ear pressure and can push a retracted eardrum out of the middle ear if it is not adherent to middle ear structures. Hearing may improve as a result, however it can be a painful maneuver. The benefits are typically only temporary. Middle ear pressure can also be increased by Politzerization and with commercially available devices (e.g. Otovent and Ear Popper).  Ventilation tubes  A ventilation tube, also known as a tympanostomy tube or a grommet, may be placed through the eardrum to equalize middle ear pressure. Although this intervention may be effective, research has not yet shown whether it provides better results than simple observation. Further weakness or perforation of the eardrum may occur.  Nasal treatments  These are intended to improve Eustachian tube function. Adenoidectomy can improve middle ear function and nasal steroid sprays can reduce adenoid size but it is not known whether these treatments alter tympanic membrane retraction.  Eustachian tube surgery  Enlargement of the Eustachian tube opening in the nose with laser or balloon dilatation is being evaluated as a potential treatment for tympanic membrane retraction.  Retraction pocket surgery  Excision of the retracted segment of an eardrum, with or without placement of a tympanostomy tube has been advocated. Healing of the area can result in a more normal eardrum. Laser therapy has been used to shrink and stiffen retraction pockets.  Tympanoplasty  Tympanoplasty is the surgical technique of removal of the retracted area from the middle ear and reconstruction of the tympanic membrane. Some surgeons use cartilage (taken from the outer ear) to stiffen the eardrum with the aim of preventing further retraction. Surgical removal is required once a cholesteatoma has formed.

Esagil-kƒ´n-apli relates that he assembled the diagnostic omens to produce the received text for the first millennium during the reign of Adad-apla-iddina.

The primary purpose of the diagnosis was to identify the divine sender of the disease, as this was perceived to be a message from a deity. He applies a logical set of axioms and assumptions, including the need to inspect the symptoms of a patient in order to come up with a diagnosis, and arranges the more than 3,000 entries systematically from head to foot, left (inauspicious) to right (auspicious), and in the color sequence red/brown, yellow/green, black or white, and two shades of uncertain hue on 40 tablets as this is the number of the god Ea who gave man diagnostic knowledge.

Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay. Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, the other half developed The Last of Us. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie respectively through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story. The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla. Following its announcement in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely anticipated. It was released for the PlayStation 3 in June 2013; a remastered version was released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2014. It was praised for its narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, characterization, and depiction of female characters. The Last of Us became one of the best-selling video games of all time, selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. The game won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards, from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. After the game's release, Naughty Dog released several downloadable content additions. The Last of Us: Left Behind adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. A sequel, The Last of Us Part II, was released in June 2020.  Gameplay  The Last of Us is an action-adventure survival horror game played from a third- person perspective. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States. The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment, and briefly controls Joel's daughter Sarah in the opening sequence. In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotguns. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits, shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged through the use of health kits. left Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. \\"Listen Mode\\" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu. The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.  Multiplayer  The online multiplayer allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team deathmatches, with the latter excluding the ability to respawn; Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's lockbox, and the first to capture said lockbox wins. In every mode, players select a faction‚ÄîHunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)‚Äîand keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve \\"weeks\\", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction. Killing enemies, reviving allies, and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies; supplies can also be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan's supplies grow. Players can connect the game to their Facebook account, which alters clan members' names and faces to match the players' Facebook friends. Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems. The multiplayer servers for the PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down on September 3, 2019.  Plot  In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess (Annie Wersching) in the quarantine zone in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities. The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a government patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler and survivalist who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle from Bill's neighborhood. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide. In the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in Jackson, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife Maria (Ashley Scott). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he lets her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two are attacked by bandits, and Joel is severely wounded while escaping. During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben Langdon), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food. David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches her just as she kills David with a machete, an act which traumatizes her, and comforts her before they flee. In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning, before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room, kills the lead surgeon, and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people but were unable to create a cure, and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her survivor guilt. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true.  Development  Naughty Dog began developing The Last of Us in 2009, following the release of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011), the other began work on The Last of Us. Game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann led the team responsible for developing The Last of Us. While at university, Druckmann had an idea to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991‚Äì2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. Druckmann views The Last of Us as a coming of age story, in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel, as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child. A major motif of the game is that \\"life goes on\\"; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to \\"reignite [Ellie's] lust for life\\", after her suffering following her encounter with David. The Infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. alt=A 56-year-old man with dark gray hair talking into a microphone, looking at something beneath the camera. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed to the development of the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Following comparisons to actress Ellen Page, Ellie's appearance was redesigned to better reflect Johnson's personality and make her younger. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist, but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality. The Last of Us features an original score composed primarily by Gustavo Santaolalla, along with compositions by Andrew Buresh, Anthony Caruso, and Jonathan Mayer. Known for his minimalist compositions, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. He used various instruments to compose the score, including some that he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. This minimalist approach was also taken with the game's sound and art design. The sound of the Infected was one of the first tasks during development; the team experimented with the sound in order to achieve the best work possible. To achieve the sound of the Clicker, they hired voice actress Misty Lee, who provided a sound that audio lead Phillip Kovats described as originating in the \\"back of the throat\\". The art department took various pieces of work as inspiration, such as Robert Polidori's photographs following Hurricane Katrina, which were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh. The art department were forced to negotiate for things that they wished to include, due to the strong differing opinions of the team during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The game's opening credits were produced by Sony's San Diego Studio. The Last of Us game designer Ricky Cambier cited the video games Ico and Resident Evil 4 as influences on the game design. He said the emotional weight of the relationship needed to be balanced with the tension of the world's issues, stating that they \\"wanted to take the character building and interaction\\" of Ico and \\"blend it with the tension and action of Resident Evil 4.\\" The team created new engines to satisfy their needs for the game. The artificial intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor to the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development. The Last of Us was announced on December 10, 2011, at the Spike Video Game Awards, alongside its debut trailer and an official press release acknowledging some of the game's features. The announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry, which journalists owed to Naughty Dog's reputation. The game missed its original projected release date of May 7, 2013, and was pushed to June 14, 2013 worldwide for further polishing. To promote pre-order sales, Naughty Dog collaborated with several retailers to provide special editions of the game with extra content.  Additional content  Downloadable content (DLC) for the game was released following its launch. The game's Season Pass includes access to all DLC, as well as some additional abilities, and the documentary Grounded: Making The Last of Us; the documentary was released online in February 2014. Two DLC packs were included with some of the game's special editions and were available upon release. The Sights and Sounds Pack included the soundtrack, a dynamic theme for the PlayStation 3 home screen, and two avatars. The Survival Pack featured bonus skins for the player following the completion of the campaign, and in-game money, as well as bonus experience points and early access to customizable items for the game's multiplayer. Abandoned Territories Map Pack, released on October 15, 2013, added four new multiplayer maps, based on locations in the game's story. Nightmare Bundle, released on November 5, 2013, added a collection of ten head items, nine of which are available to purchase separately. The Last of Us: Left Behind adds a single-player campaign which serves as a prequel to the main storyline, featuring Ellie and her friend Riley. It was released on February 14, 2014 as DLC and on May 12, 2015 as a standalone expansion pack. A third bundle was released on May 6, 2014, featuring five separate DLC: Grounded added a new difficulty to the main game and Left Behind; Reclaimed Territories Map Pack added new multiplayer maps; Professional Survival Skills Bundle and Situational Survival Skills Bundle added eight new multiplayer skills; and Survivalist Weapon Bundle added four new weapons. The Grit and Gear Bundle, which added new headgear items, masks and gestures, was released on August 5, 2014. A Game of the Year Edition containing all downloadable content was released in Europe on November 11, 2014.  The Last of Us Remastered  On April 9, 2014, Sony announced The Last of Us Remastered, an enhanced version of the game for the PlayStation 4. It was released on July 29, 2014 in North America. Remastered uses the DualShock 4's touchpad to navigate inventory items, and the light bar signals health, scaling from green to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely. In the menu, players have the ability to watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring Druckmann, Baker, and Johnson. Remastered features improved graphics and rendering upgrades, including increased draw distance, an upgraded combat mechanic, a higher frame rate, and advanced audio options. It includes the previously released downloadable content, including Left Behind and some multiplayer maps. The development team aimed to create a \\"true\\" remaster, maintaining the \\"core experience\\" and major story and gameplay elements.  Reception   Critical response  The Last of Us received \\"universal acclaim\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 98 reviews. It is the fifth-highest-rated PlayStation 3 game on Metacritic. Reviewers praised the character development, story and subtext, visual and sound design, and depiction of female and LGBT characters. It is considered one of the most significant seventh-generation video games, and has been included among the greatest video games of all time. Colin Moriarty of IGN called The Last of Us \\"a masterpiece\\" and \\"PlayStation 3's best exclusive\\", and Edge considered it \\"the most riveting, emotionally resonant story-driven epic\\" of the console generation. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer wrote that it is \\"a beacon of hope\\" for the survival horror genre; Andy Kelly of Computer and Video Games declared it \\"Naughty Dog's finest moment\\". Kelly of Computer and Video Games found the story memorable, and IGNs Moriarty named it one of the game's standout features. PlayStation Official Magazines David Meikleham wrote that the pacing contributed to the improvement of the story, stating that there is \\"a real sense of time elapsed and journey traveled along every step of the way\\", and Destructoids Jim Sterling lauded the game's suspenseful moments. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq found that the narrative improved the character relationships. The characters‚Äîparticularly the relationship between Joel and Ellie‚Äîreceived acclaim. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the relationship felt identifiable, naming it \\"poignant\\" and \\"well-drawn\\". Eurogamers Welsh wrote that the characters were developed with \\"real patience and skill\\", appreciating their emotional value, and Joystiq's Mitchell found the relationship \\"genuine\\" and emotional. PlayStation Official Magazines Meikleham named Joel and Ellie the best characters of any PlayStation 3 game, while IGNs Moriarty identified it as a highlight of the game. Kelly of Computer and Video Games named the characters \\"richly painted\\", feeling invested in their stories. Philip Kollar of Polygon felt that Ellie was believable, making it easier to develop a connection to her, and that the relationship between the characters was assisted by the game's optional conversations. The performances also received praise, with Edge and Eurogamers Welsh noting that the script improved as a result. Many reviewers found the game's combat a refreshing difference from other games. Game Informers Helgeson appreciated the vulnerability during fights, while Kelly of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the variety in approaching the combat. IGNs Moriarty felt that the crafting system assisted the combat, and that the latter contributed to the narrative's emotional value, adding that enemies feel \\"human\\". Joystiqs Mitchell reiterated similar comments, stating that the combat \\"piles death upon death on Joel's hands\\". Welsh of Eurogamer found the suspenseful and threatening encounters added positively to the gameplay. Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot wrote that the artificial intelligence negatively affected the combat, with enemies often ignoring players' companions. Polygons Kollar also felt that the combat was unfair, especially when fighting the Infected, and noted some inconsistencies in the game's artificial intelligence that \\"shatters the atmosphere\\" of the characters. artistic and graphic, were also well received.alt=A location, formerly a city street, with overgrown plants, broken cars and flooding. The game's visual features were commended by many reviewers. The art design was lauded as \\"outstanding\\" by Computer and Video Games Kelly, and \\"jaw-dropping\\" by Eurogamers Welsh. In contrast, Mc Shea of GameSpot identified the visual representation of the post-apocalyptic world was \\"mundane\\", having been portrayed various times previously. The game's graphics have been frequently named by critics as the best for a PlayStation 3 game, with Helgeson of Game Informer naming them \\"unmatched in console gaming\\" and Moriarty of IGN stating that they contribute to the realism. Destructoids Sterling wrote that the game was visually impressive but that technical issues, such as some \\"muddy and basic\\" textures found early in the game, left a negative impact on the visuals. The world and environments of the game drew acclaim from many reviewers. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that the environments are \\"large, detailed, and littered with secrets\\", adding that The Last of Us \\"masks\\" its linearity successfully. Edge repeated similar remarks, writing that the level design serves the story appropriately. Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the world \\"effectively and gorgeously [conveys] the loneliness\\" of the story. IGNs Moriarty appreciated the added design elements placed around the game world, such as the hidden notes and letters. The plausibility of the infection was commended by Scientific Americans Kyle Hill. Reviewers praised the use of sound in The Last of Us. Eurogamers Welsh felt that the sound design was significantly better than in other games, while Game Informers Helgeson dubbed it \\"amazing\\". Mc Shea of GameSpot stated that the audio added to the effect of the gameplay, particularly when hiding from enemies. Kelly of Computer and Video Games found that the environmental audio positively impacted gameplay, and that Gustavo Santaolalla's score was \\"sparse and delicate\\". Both Game Informers Helgeson and Destructoid's Sterling called the score \\"haunting\\", with the latter finding that it complements the gameplay. The graphic depiction of violence in The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was \\"a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety\\", as opposed to being used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was \\"heavy, consequential and necessary\\", as opposed to gratuitous. USGamers Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the \\"incredibly brutal\\" combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. Eurogamers Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not \\"desensitized or mindless\\". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiqs Mitchell wrote that the violence is \\"designed to be uncomfortable\\", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game. Many critics discussed the game's depiction of female characters. Jason Killingsworth of Edge praised its lack of sexualized female characters, writing that it \\"offers a refreshing antidote to the sexism and regressive gender attitudes of most blockbuster videogames\\". Eurogamers Ellie Gibson praised Ellie as \\"sometimes strong, sometimes vulnerable, but never a clich√©\\". She felt that Ellie is initially established as a \\"damsel in distress\\", but that this concept is subverted. GameSpots Carolyn Petit praised the female characters as morally conflicted and sympathetic, but wrote that gender in video games should be evaluated \\"based on their actual merits, not in relation to other games\\". Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times acknowledged that Ellie was a likable and \\"sometimes powerful\\" character, but argued that The Last of Us is \\"actually the story of Joel\\", stating that it's \\"another video game by men, for men and about men\\". The Last of Us was also praised for its depiction of LGBT characters. Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality \\"added to his character ... without really tokenizing him\\". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the \\"most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013\\", calling him \\"deeply flawed but wholly unique\\". A kiss between two female characters in Left Behind was met with positive reactions. = Remastered = Like the original version, The Last of Us Remastered received \\"universal acclaim\\" according to Metacritic, based on 69 critics. It is the third-highest rated PlayStation 4 game on Metacritic, behind Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. The game's enhanced graphics received positive reactions. Colin Moriarty of IGN felt that the graphical fidelity of Remastered was an improvement over The Last of Us, despite the latter being \\"the most beautiful game [he'd] seen on any console\\". GamesRadar's David Houghton echoed this statement, calling the visuals \\"jaw-dropping\\". VideoGamer.com reiterated the graphical improvement over the original game, particularly praising the increased draw distance and improved lighting technology. Liam Martin of Digital Spy also felt that the lighting system improves the gameplay and makes the game \\"feel even more dangerous\\". Game Informers Tim Turi stated that the game is \\"even more breathtaking\\" than The Last of Us. Matt Swider of TechRadar appreciated the minor detail changes and the technical improvements. The Independents Jack Fleming felt that the original game's visual flaws were enhanced in Remastered, but greatly complimented the updated graphics regardless. Many reviewers considered the technical enhancements, such as the increased frame rate, a welcome advancement from the original game. Turi of Game Informer felt that the frame rate \\"dramatically elevate[s]\\" the game above the original. Jim Sterling of The Escapist complimented the upgraded frame rate, commenting that the original frame rate is a \\"noticeably inferior experience\\". IGNs Moriarty stated that, though the change was initially \\"jarring\\", he appreciated it through further gameplay. Tom Hoggins of The Daily Telegraph echoed these statements, feeling as though the increased frame rate heightened the intensity of the gameplay. Metros David Jenkins felt that the increased frame rate is almost imperceptible, though stating that it is \\"definitely an improvement\\". Philip Kollar of Polygon appreciated the game's improved textures and loading times. The addition of Photo Mode was well received. TechRadars Swider named the mode as a standout feature, while IGNs Moriarty complimented the availability to capture \\"gorgeous\\" images using the feature. The adjustment of the controls received praise, with Moriarty of IGN particularly approving the DualShock 4's triggers. Swider of TechRadar felt that the additional controls result in a better functioning game, while Digital Spy's Martin felt that it improves the game's combat, commenting that it \\"increase[s] this sense of immersion\\". Reviewers also appreciated the inclusion of the DLC and the audio commentary. These features led The Escapists Sterling to dub Remastered as \\"the definitive version of the game\\".  Sales  Within seven days of its release, The Last of Us sold over 1.3 million units, becoming the biggest video game launch of 2013 at the time. Three weeks after its release, the game sold over 3.4 million units, and was deemed the biggest launch of an original game since 2011's L.A.

Adaptations  A four-issue comic book miniseries, The Last of Us: American Dreams, was published by Dark Horse Comics from April to July 2013. Written by Druckmann and illustrated by Faith Erin Hicks, the comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of a younger Ellie and Riley. On July 28, 2014, the cast of the game performed a live reading of selected scenes in Santa Monica, California, with live music by Santaolalla. The performance was hosted and directed by Druckmann, with graphics by Alex Hobbs. On March 6, 2014, Sony announced that Screen Gems would distribute a film adaptation of The Last of Us, written by Druckmann and produced by Sam Raimi. By January 2015, Druckmann had written the script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. In November 2016, Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann. Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie, and was in talks with both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role. In January 2020, images surfaced of an animated short film adaptation of The Last of Us by production agency Oddfellows. The 20-minute film was intended to \\"serve as a strong bridge\\" between the game and its sequel and would \\"reinterpret each of the chapters of the game with a unique visual treatment\\", but was canceled by Sony. In March 2020, a television adaptation of the game was announced in the planning stages at HBO, expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel. Alongside Druckmann, Craig Mazin was named to help write and executive produce the series. Additional executive producers will include television producer Carolyn Strauss, Naughty Dog CEO Evan Wells, and director Johan Renck. Renck will also direct the pilot episode. The show is a joint production of Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and the first show produced by the latter. Santaolalla will compose the score.  Sequel  In February 2014, Druckmann said Naughty Dog were considering a sequel but needed to find a story \\"really worth telling, and that's not repeating itself\\". In September 2015, Druckmann stated that a small team had begun building prototypes, but shifted development to Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, released in May 2016. Sony announced The Last of Us Part II at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3, 2016. The story takes place about five years after the first game; Ellie and Joel return, with players controlling Ellie. Santaolalla returned to compose the music, and Druckmann returned to write the story alongside Halley Gross. Straley did not return as game director. It was released on June 19, 2020.

Wards in grey were not contested in 2011. The 2011 Carlisle City Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Carlisle District Council in Cumbria, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 24 *Conservative 22 *Liberal Democrats 4 *Independent 2 Background Before the election Labour were the largest party on the council with 23 seats, compared to 22 Conservatives, 5 Liberal Democrats and 2 independents. However the Conservatives ran the council in alliance with the Liberal Democrats. At the election one councillor stood down, Labour's Mary Styth, who had held Belle Vue ward. 18 seats were contested at the election, with Labour standing in all 18 seats, the Conservatives in 17, the Green Party in 8, Liberal Democrats 7, UK Independence Party 4, Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition 4, British National Party 2 and the Communist Party in 1 seat. The candidates in Morton ward included Conservative Judith Pattinson, who was attempting to return to the council she had left in 2004, and the former Labour mayor John Metcalfe, who was standing as a Communist. There were also going to be 6 independent candidates, however the former Conservative councillor for Belah, Alan Toole, withdrew on 5 April. The other independents included Andrew Hill, a campaigner against the redevelopment of the Sands Centre in Carlisle, and husband and wife Jonathan and Julia Devlin. Jonathan Devlin had been Conservative councillor for Lyne since 2007, but stood as an independent after the Conservatives began looking for other candidates to stand for the seat. Campaign A big issue at the election were the cuts being made by the national Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition, with Labour saying the Liberal Democrats in particular would suffer as a result. Other local issues included a redevelopment at Carlisle Lake District Airport and a proposed new housing estate in Crindledyke. Labour targeted Castle ward, which the Liberal Democrats held, and where Labour had come close at the 2010 election. However the Conservatives hoped to challenge Labour in Belle Vue and Yewdale wards. Election result Only one seat changed parties, with Labour gaining the only seat the Liberal Democrats had been defending, in Castle ward. This meant that Labour remained the largest party on the council with 24 councillors, but without a majority as the Conservatives remained on 22 seats, the Liberal Democrats had 4 and there were 2 independents. The Liberal Democrats suffered a substantial drop in the share of the vote, with the party coming fifth in Currock ward and third in Morton, a seat the party had previously held. The Liberal Democrats said they had suffered as a result of entering the coalition government nationally, while the Labour group leader, Reg Watson, saw the results as giving Labour \\"a good chance\\" to take control at the 2012 election. Following the election, Conservative Mike Mitchelson was re-elected as leader of the council by 26 votes to 25. Meanwhile, Joe Hendry became the new leader of the Labour group on the council taking over from Reg Watson, while the 2 independent councillors joined together in an Independent group.

History The beginning of a self- conscious classical tradition is usually located in the Renaissance, with the work of Petrarch in 14th-century Italy.Kallendorf, introduction to Companion, p. 1. Although Petrarch believed that he was recovering an unobstructed view of a classical past that had been obscured for centuries, the classical tradition in fact had continued uninterrupted during the Middle Ages.Kallendorf, introduction to Companion, p. 2. There was no single moment of rupture when the inhabitants of what was formerly the Roman Empire went to bed in antiquity and awoke in the medieval world; rather, the cultural transformation occurred over centuries. The use and meaning of the classical tradition may seem, however, to change dramatically with the emergence of humanism.Kallendorf, introduction to Companion, pp. 1‚Äì2.

(Federico Barocci, 1598) The phrase \\"classical tradition\\" is itself a modern label, articulated most notably in the post-World War II era with The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature of Gilbert Highet (1949) and The Classical Heritage and Its Beneficiaries of R. R. Bolgar (1954). The English word \\"tradition,\\" and with it the concept of \\"handing down\\" classical culture, derives from the Latin verb trado, tradere, traditus, in the sense of \\"hand over, hand down.\\"Kallendorf, introduction to Companion, p. 1. Writers and artists influenced by the classical tradition may name their ancient models, or allude to their works. Often scholars infer classical influence through comparative methods that reveal patterns of thought. Sometimes authors' copies of Greek and Latin texts will contain handwritten annotations that offer direct evidence of how they read and understood their classical models; for instance, in the late 20th century the discovery of Montaigne's copy of Lucretius enabled scholars to document an influence that had long been recognized.Kallendorf, introduction to Companion, p. 2.

It is celebrated to thank God for the abundance of food at the time of the harvest period of the area. History lithograph of a castle in Axim The festival is believed to have first been celebrated in the 16th century. The first record of the festival was made by Bossman, a Dutch explorer who traveled to the Gold Coast in the 17th century and observed the festival. Origin According to oral history and folklore, the festival began when a hunter, Akpoley, during an expedition, chanced upon some dwarves dancing in a circle. After observing the dance, he returned to his town and introduced it to his people. The ritual dancing is associated with expelling the devil and evil spirits from towns and villages. During the festival, the dance is performed by most inhabitants of Axim and surrounding towns. It comes from Ahanta in the Western region of Ghana. Festival type Kundum is both a harvest and religious festival. The start of the festival is based on the day the fruit of a certain palm tree became ripe. The celebration Originally, the festival lasted for four weeks but due to modernity, in recent years it has been reduced to eight days. The festivals occur separately in each town that make up the Ahanta paramountcy . The towns each schedule independently on which Sunday their local festival will start. The celebration consists of three main components: *dancing *drumming *feast Festival attire The people who participate in the celebration wear distinctive dress, footwear, and sometimes masks. The festival begins by musicians taking the drums to the five different shrines on outskirts of town. At the shrines, requests for the good of the town made , and rum is poured on the ground as libation. Programme of activities In the traditional four-week celebration, the drummers will spend the next three weeks in the outskirts practicing and preparing for the fourth week. No drumming or dancing is done on the Monday of the fourth and final week. The ritual Kundum fire is lit at the chief‚Äôs palace and is kept burning throughout the festivities. The fire serves as a center of activity and heat source for preparing the main festival meal. On Tuesday, sacrifices of fowl or sheep are offered in the stool room. The stool room is a sacred palace where the stools of departed chiefs and elders are kept. All of the sacrifices in the stool room are performed privately by a small designated group. Finally a public sacrifice of a fowl is performed in the courtyard. Singing begins on Tuesday and on Wednesday, the chief joins festivities. He enters on a palanquin accompanied by a parade of people singing and drumming. Each night the people eat a large meal together, culminating in a great feast of the final Sunday. All the food is collectively prepared by the women using the Kundum fire, and they are directed by the elder women. The remainder of the week is spent performing the ritualized Kundum dancing. Some dances are performed by men and others by women; others are not distinguished by gender requirements. The dancing concludes in front of the castle in Axim. The traditional purpose of the dancing is to drive the evil spirits and devils from the town and preserve another successful year.

Retrieved September 30, 2011 The year 1923 saw his first published work, a slim volume titled Three Stories and Ten Poems, followed the next year by a collection of short vignettes, in our time (without capitals).Baker (1972), 15‚Äì18Oliver (1999), 168‚Äì169 Hoping to have in our time published in New York, in 1924 he began writing stories to add to the volume.Mellow (1992), 271 On October 5, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York.Baker (1972), 410; Oliver (1999),169 In those years the Hemingways were avid skiers after their first trip to Switzerland in 1922. Hadley wrote \\"skiing became a must\\", adding, \\"It is the kind of thing that it seems one will never learn, and then all of a sudden you can do it\\". In the early 1920s they stayed in Montreaux and skied at Les Avants; by the mid- 1920s they spent most of the winter months in Austria, at Schruns. Hemingway wrote \\"Cross Country Snow\\" in 1924 after wintering for the first time in Cortina d'Ampezzo with Hadley and their infant son Jack.Danby-Smith, Valerie. \\"The Short Happy Ski Life of Ernest Hemingway\\". Skiing Heritage. September 2009. Hemingway took skiing lessons from the partner of Austrian skiing instructor Hannes Schneider, where friends such as John Dos Passos joined him. Without ski lifts, skiers made the steep climb to high snow fields, a challenge Hemingway enjoyed, followed by the exhilaration of skiing down. In the spring months they were able to ski as many as 40 miles a day on the glaciers. For the first time he grew a beard during the winter months to protect his skin from sun and snow. Plot summary In \\"Cross Country Snow,\\" Nick Adams and his friend George have gone skiing in Switzerland. The story begins with Nick riding up the mountain on a funicular car while watching George ski down the mountain. Nick then arrives at the top of the mountain and begins skiing down. He loses control and crashes into a pile of soft snow. He and George continue down the mountain, stopping several times to comment on the terrain. When they arrive at the base of the run, they walk to an inn for a drink. When they arrive at the inn, they order a bottle of wine and notice that their waitress is pregnant although she does not appear to be married. Nick and George then discuss their lives: how Nick‚Äôs wife is pregnant so they will be returning to the United States and how George must finish his education. They regret that they will have to give up their ski trips and discuss that perhaps they will return to ski once again sometime in the future. Finally, they leave the inn for a final run home together. Themes and style According to Hemingway scholar Wendolyn Tetlow the short stories in In Our Time are structured to form a thematic unity.Tetlow (1992), 23 The volume's early stories are about senseless death and the \\"ultimate nothingness of existence\\", whereas the second half of the collection focuses on how to cope with pain, wounding and suffering, and how to accept life. Cross Country Snow is about escape and yet the need to accept life's burdens.Tetlow (1992), 70 The story's tension lies in the need opposition of freedom and duty, with the opening conveying a sense of freedom as Nick Adams skis down the mountain. Joseph Flora says Hemingway juxtaposes pleasure and responsibility.Flora, (1989) Both young men, Nick and George face duties after this day of skiing; George must return to school and Nick's wife is pregnant. Hemingway scholar David Ferrero explains that some early stories from In Our Time, including \\"Cross Country Snow\\", have received readings from critics positioning Hemingway as a misogynist in a world of men without women.Ferrero (2004), 126 In her article \\"Doomed Biologically: Sex and Entrapment in Ernest Hemingway‚Äôs ‚ÄòCross Country Snow‚Äô,\\" Olivia Carr Edenfield writes that by having Nick strap himself into his ski-binding creates and image of a young man bound and strapped into marriage and impending fatherhood.Edenfield (1999) In the inn, while Nick and George are talking, the reader realizes several things about Nick. He is removed from the surroundings as if he were already a tourist visiting a foreign land. The Swiss locals in the bar are contrasted with the \\"boys\\" as they enter; and in counterpoint to Nick, the waitress is pregnant but unmarried. Although they want to ski again together the two young men know they might not; each has a responsibility and as Kenneth Johnston says \\"the best of friends often lose track of one another\\".Johnston (1987), 67 The last piece of dialogue shifts from gloominess to hopefulness to defeat, according to Tetlow, ending with Nick's declaration there is no \\"good in promising\\".Tetlow (1992), 86 Hemingway used pervasive snow imagery in many short stories and in A Farewell to Arms, usually symbolizing love and romance.Oldsey (1963), 172 The story's lyricism and \\"subtle nuances\\" are the strongest of the stories in the collection.Tetlow (1992), 84 Its structure is similar to \\"The Three-Day Blow\\", which Hemingway would use again in the fishing scenes of The Sun Also Rises.Tetlow (1992), 138 It begins with frequent use of soft sounds, \\"snow\\", \\"solidly\\", \\"surface\\", \\"skis\\", which reflect the movements of skiing. Tetlow says the \\"sensuous language renders the sensation of flight\\". The snow is equally visual and tactile. The language captures the rhythm of skiing, with up-and-down movements, the swoop of the slope, yet Nick tries to restrain himself from gathering too much speed, from losing control, and yet, not completely in control, he crashes.Tetlow (1992), 85  References  Sources * Baker, Carlos (1981).

French company Eclair owned the cinematic rights to Conan Doyle's stories up to 1912 which left only one full length story available, The Valley of Fear While James Bragington was considered a virtual doppelg√§nger of Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet, the role in The Valley of Fear required more from an actor so H.A.

The theatre is surrounded by Imperial Hofburg, the Hofgarten, and SOWI Faculty of the University of Innsbruck. The main theatre has about 800 seats and the studio theatre in the basement has around 250. Plays, operas, operettas, musicals and dance theatre are performed at the theatre. History In 1629, architect Christopher Gump the Younger converted one of the houses along a raceway from the Imperial Hofburg into a Comedihaus, the great theater of the Archduke Leopold. In 1654, a new theatre was built by Christopher Gump which opened on the other side of the raceway where the Landestheater stands today. This court theater was renovated in 1765. Following the Bavarian occupation in 1805, the theatre was called the Royal Bavarian Court National Theatre. In 1844, the theatre was closed due to disrepair. In the 1840s, a theater company was constituted and donations were raised. The existing theatre building was opened in 1846. In 1945, the city theatre was renamed the Tiroler Landestheater (Tyrolean State Theatre). In 1959, the studio theatre in the basement was opened. The Tyrolean Provincial Theatre or main theatre was closed in 1961 and rebuilt in the following years and significantly expanded. In 1967, the main theatre was reopened. In 1991 and 1992, the theatre was renovated and converted into a flexible space theater. In 2003, the new rehearsal stage was designed by the architect Karl Probst of Munich and completed as an extension to the main theatre. The Landestheater, with its three venues, meets the requirements of a modern stage operation and ensures that ambitious stage productions will take place in Innsbruck. As a final construction, the fa√ßade of the Landestheater was renovated and a new forecourt was added.

History Salzburg Felsenreitschule, engraving by Johann Homann, A first Baroque theatre was erected in 1693‚Äì94 at the behest of the Salzburg prince-archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun, according to plans probably designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Built in the former M√∂nchsberg quarry for conglomerate rock used in the new Salzburg Cathedral construction, it was located next to the archiepiscopal stables (at the site of the present Gro√ües Festspielhaus) and used as a summer riding school and for animal hunts. The audience was seated in 96 arcades carved into the M√∂nchsberg rock on three floors. After the secularisation of the prince-archbishopric, the premises were used by the cavalry of the Austrian Imperial-Royal Army as well as by Bundesheer forces after World War I. From 1926, the Felsenreitschule was used as an open-air theatre for performances of the Salzburg Festival. With the auditorium reversed, the former audience arcades now served as a natural stage setting. The first production was Carlo Goldoni's The Servant of Two Masters, directed by Max Reinhardt. In 1933, Clemens Holzmeister designed for Max Reinhardt the \\"Faust Town\\", a multiple-stage setting for Reinhardt's legendary production of Goethe's Faust. In 1948 Herbert von Karajan first used the Felsenreitschule as an opera stage, for performances of Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. This was followed in 1949 by the premiere of Carl Orff's setting of the ancient tragedy Antigone by Sophocles, translated into German by Friedrich H√∂lderlin, conducted by Ferenc Fricsay. Between 1968 and 1970, the Felsenreitschule was again remodeled according to plans by Clemens Holzmeister and inaugurated with Ludwig van Beethoven's Fidelio under the baton of Karl B√∂hm. Architecture Karl-B√∂hm-Saal The stage has a width of , and understage. Also renovated was the cantilevered grandstand with the underlying scene dock. A light-tight, rain tarp to dampen the noise and protect the stage was also added. This roof can be opened. The theater holds 1412 seats and 25 standing places. Between the summers of 2010 and 2011 festival, the roof was renewed: The new design added of floor space for equipment and rehearsal rooms. The new pitched roof consists of three mobile segment surfaces and is on five telescopic arms and can be extended and retracted in six minutes. Suspension points on telescopic supports for stage equipment (hoists), improved sound and heat insulation, and two lighting bridges optimize the action on stage. The Felsenreitschule shares its foyer with the Kleines Festspielhaus (House for Mozart).  In popular culture  The Felsenreitschule was used as a location for the 1965 film version of The Sound of Music. It appears as the site of the Salzburg music festival from which the von Trapp family disappear.

The staff consists of 340 people originating from 35 different countries. The theatre is a listed building and part of the Altstadt, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History In 1775, Prince Archbishop Colloredo built the 'Prince Archbishop Court Theatre' on the site of the former ballroom of 1625. The official opening of the building was celebrated with Christian Heinrich Schmid‚Äôs Die Gunst des F√ºrsten which, beholden to enlightenment, was soon followed by Schiller‚Äôs dramas. Emmanuel Schikaneder was engaged as director of the Court Theatre for several years. During this time, he became acquainted with the Mozart family, whom he regularly invited to his box. Mozart's music was performed there for the first time in 1776. With the staging of Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail in 1784, regular performances of Mozart‚Äôs repertoire began.

The building was opened on October 1, 1893 with the overture from Mozart‚Äôs La clemenza di Tito. In this year, Max Reinhardt had been engaged as an actor in the company, and later co- founded the Salzburg Festival. Because of the Second World War, the theatre was closed in 1944.

He obtained considerable recognition for his work, becoming the town's official painter after the death of Rogier van der Weyden in 1464.

The York had been delivered to the Royal Air Force in February 1946, it was withdrawn from use and sold as a civilian aircraft in 1952. Accident Following the aircraft's departure from Karachi Airport in Pakistan's Sindh province, an in-flight fire developed en route to Delhi. This necessitated an immediate forced landing on rough terrain near Gurgaon in the Indian state of Haryana, resulting in the aircraft's break-up and a post-crash fire. Among the crew of five, the radio operator was the sole survivor. This crash was Dan-Air's first fatal accident.

Ashley was born at Damerham, the son of Sir Anthony Ashley of Damerham in Wiltshire and his wife Dorothy Lyte, daughter of John Lyte of Lytes Cary, Somerset. At the age of 16 he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, and graduated with BA on 5 June 1589. He went on to study law at the Middle Temple where he was called to the bar in 1596.

He purchased the Old Friary on the north side of the town by the river Frome where he made extensive alterations and lived there with his family.Michael Russell Sir Francis Ashley (1569-1625) In 1614, Ashley was elected Member of Parliament for Dorchester. He became reader at the Middle Temple in 1616. In 1617 he became Serjeant-at-law and in the same year granted to Rev. Robert Cheeke, the master of the Free School and Rector of All Saints Church, all his \\"tithes of corne, grayne, hay, woole, lambes, oak etc belonging to the free chapel of Pudle Waterston\\". Ashley was knighted on 5 July 1618. In 1621 he was re-elected MP for Dorchester but on 13 February 1621 resigned his place in favour of Sir Thomas Edmondes. However Edmondes chose to sit elsewhere and Ashley was chosen again as MP for Dorchester on 9 Mar 1621. He was greatly influenced by the Rev. John White rector of Holy Trinity and St Peters, and with him and others invested in 1624 in the Dorchester Company. Ashley was elected MP for Dorchester again in 1625. In Parliament he strongly supported the royal prerogative and was an active member and chairman of committees However, in his religious views he was sympathetic to the Puritan cause. He became King's Serjeant in 1625 and was very active at Dorchester sitting regularly at the Quarter Sessions from 1625 until his death. He was chosen as the judge for an extraordinary commission set up on 17 January 1627 when he condemned seven soldiers and a tapster to death for burglary although six soldiers were later pardoned. On 22 April 1628, he was imprisoned by the House of Lords for speaking against liberty of the subject, but was released when he recanted and craved pardon. As King's Serjeant, he represented the Crown in various cases including the trial of John Felton, the assassin of the Duke of Buckingham. He suffered an attack of Palsy in London on 7 January 1629 but recovered. In the new charter granted to Dorchester on 22 September 1629, his appointment as recorder was confirmed. On 19 June 1630 he had to defend himself before the star chamber against accusations of a conspiracy against Sir Thomas Coventry Lord Keeper who \\"scandalized him by saying he had taken a bribe of six hundred pounds\\". Ashley's nephew Anthony Ashley Cooper had been left very extensive estates through the death of his father and grandfather and these were under the control of the Court of Wards. Ashley was among the administrators of the estates and Cooper later accused these administrators of attempting to wrest some of his lands from him while he was still a minor and a Ward of Court. Ashley he singled out as the worst and most avaricious offender who used his legal abilities and influences to obtain his ends through the Court of Wards. In one of these proceedings on 16 November 1635, Ashley was making a speech before the Court when his nephew uttered a prayer to be delivered from the lawyer's arguments and purposes. At this point Ashley collapsed with a paralytic seizure with \\"his mouth drawn to his ear\\" and was carried out of the Court and never spoke again. He died 12 days later on 28 November 1635 at the Serjeant's Inn in Fleet Street at the age of 66. His body was brought back to Dorchester and buried in St Peter's church. Ashley married Anne Samways the eldest daughter of Bernard (or Robert) Samways of Toller Fratrum and through her he acquired lands and property at Winterborne St Martin. Their only surviving child was Dorothy who married Denzil Holles on 4 June 1626.

Tightly associated with the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King, Jr. notably addressed the 1966 MCHR convention. The organization remained active for years afterward in terms of fighting for disadvantaged Americans to have expanded access to health services, becoming a part of the \\"new left\\". Activities and history Over a hundred health care professionals, doctors joined with nurses, psychologists, and social workers, spent a week or more participating in the \\"Freedom Summer\\" project. Though accustomed to at least some deference due to their profession and cause, they found themselves facing opposition from the same waves of bigotry that the civil rights workers themselves dealt with. Major governmental and non-governmental organizations did not approve of many of their methods. For example, the American Medical Association advocated an official policy up until the late 1960s in which it allowed affiliate state groups to be racially segregated, African-American physicians being denied hospital privileges and other things. On the other hand, many notable public figures advocated on the side of the MCHR; one of them, Paul Dudley White, had been President Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs personal physician. The founder was Walter Lear. Aaron O. Wells was the organization's first national chairman. Martin Luther King Jr. notably addressed the annual MCHR convention in 1966. He proclaimed, \\"Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.\\"  Decline  In the wake of the civil rights movement in the late 60s, most de jure limitations on access to medicine had fallen, leaving MCHR in a period of flux leading to its declining effectiveness during the 1970s and 1980s. The MCHR's ultimate failure to push the U.S. government to adopt either a single-payer health care system or some other form of funding that subsidizes care for all Americans, regardless of the ability to pay, demoralized members. The group did not survive the Reagan administration. Legacy The MCHR ended up functioning as a model for organizations that succeeded it, such as Physicians for Human Rights and Physicians for a National Health Program, while sharing both the MCHR's specific foundational goal (of improving healthcare access for individuals suffering from bigotry and prejudice) and larger goal (of advancing the general healthcare system to provide integrated services for all).

It is Cohen's highest-charting release in the United States, reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200, 44 years after the release of his first album. The album topped the charts in 11 countries, including Finland, where Cohen became, at the age of 77, the oldest chart- topper, during the album's debut week. The album was released on January 27, 2012, in some countries and on January 31, 2012, in the U.S. On January 22, before its release, the album was streamed online by NPR and on January 23 by The Guardian. Background Cohen's international concert tours of the late 2000s were prompted by the fact that his former manager made off with his life's savings. At their conclusion in 2009, Cohen decided to keep working and began making his twelfth studio album. Fans of Cohen had long become accustomed to long intervals in between albums - between 1979 and 1988 he released three - but the tour appeared to re-energize him, as biographer Sylvie Simmons observed in a 2012 Mojo cover story: \\"After his former manager helped herself to his savings, leaving him nothing to retire on, Leonard, in his seventies, having not been on the road in 15 years, embarked on one of the most remarkable, and remarkably successful, tours in music history, playing three-hour shows each night. And when it finished...instead of coming home and putting his feet up, he went straight to work on a new album and, even more extraordinary, in less than 12 months he finished it.\\" Recording and composition Old Ideas was recorded in Los Angeles at Cohen's own studio in his house and at 7th Street Sound with Patrick Leonard and Ed Sanders. Many of the songs explore some of Cohen's favorite themes: mortality, sex, depression, and the quest for love in an apocalyptic world. Discussing the song \\"Amen\\" in his review of the album in Uncut, Andy Gill observes: :Again, it's a rumination on deeper, darker matters delivered in the guise of a love song, the refrain 'Tell me that you love me, Amen' punctuating a series of requests to 'Tell me again...' that grow progressively bleaker as the song progresses: what kind of love song, for instance, includes a line like '...when the filth of the butcher is washed in the blood of the lamb'? Clearly, this is about love on a larger scale, about notions of ethics and morality being eroded away as if unnecessary for the future, as Cohen acknowledges with some asperity: '...when the victims are singing and the laws of remorse are restored.' Religious imagery is also prevalent, and many of the songs feature Cohen on the guitar, a change from his recent albums which had been dominated by synthesizers. Cohen worked closely with co-producer Patrick Leonard, writing four of the tracks with him: the resigned \\"Going Home,\\" \\"Show Me the Place,\\" \\"Anyhow\\" and \\"Come Healing.\\" As Cohen told Mojo in 2013, he met the producer when he was making an album with Cohen's son, singer Adam Cohen: :And I know the work he did with Madonna. I think he's a seminal figure in modern American music, very brilliant. I was listening to some of his solo piano work, too. I bumped into him with Adam several times, and somehow we got together and these four songs we did together came very quickly...Pat saw the lyric for 'Going Home' and said, 'This could be a really good song,' and I said, 'I don't think so.' He said, 'Can I have a shot at it?' I said, 'Sure.' He came back with the music, I don't know if it was the next hour or the next day but it was very fast...He is a very unusual man and, I guess, we were both in good form... One other song, \\"Crazy to Love You,\\" was the result of a collaboration with jazz singer Anjani, who had first released the song on her 2006 Cohen-produced album Blue Alert (Cohen also provided all the lyrics for the LP). The songs \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" had actually been debuted on his recent tours before being committed to tape. Cohen had originally wanted to call his previous 2004 studio album Old Ideas but opted for Dear Heather instead, fearing that fans might mistake it for a compilation album. Reception The album received uniformly positive reviews from publications including Rolling Stone, the Chicago Tribune, and The Guardian. At a record release party for the album in January 2012, Cohen spoke with The New York Times reporter Jon Pareles who states that \\"mortality was very much on his mind and in his songs [on this album].\\" Pareles goes on to characterize the album as \\"an autumnal album, musing on memories and final reckonings, but it also has a gleam in its eye. It grapples once again with topics Mr. Cohen has pondered throughout his career: love, desire, faith, betrayal, redemption. Some of the diction is biblical; some is drily sardonic.\\" In a four star review, Victoria Segal of Mojo called Old Ideas, \\"a quietly surprising album, full of grace, full of sadness, but also, most importantly, full of life.\\" Uncut awarded the album four stars.

Having come to prominence by excelling in the Kennedy Cup competition for the Limerick District Schoolboy League selection, Dillon was the only Limerick player chosen to play for the Republic of Ireland u-15 team in the 1993/94 season, winning his first international cap against Austria. At this point he was still playing for Geraldines, the famous nursery club in Limerick, where he was renowned for his flying runs up the left flank and his excellent set-piece ability. Dillon was the stand-out player in what was called \\"The Dream Team\\", a crack Geraldines side put together in an attempt to win the national (Evans) cup competition (but who lost surprisingly to New Ross, of Wexford, in the last eight. In 1995, Dillon had a successful trial with Rotherham United FC and moved over to England. Despite some tempestuous displays in the reserve team, including a fist-fight with Coventry City's former Benfica star Isiais, Dillon quickly broke into the first team at Millmoor and - by the latter part of the 1996/97 season, he was a regular at left-back in the first team. He scored an outrageous goal from 50 yards against Gillingham which brought him back to the notice of the Ireland scouts. Accordingly, Dillon was included in the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team for the 1997 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship finals in Iceland, and played all of the games in that tournament as the first choice at left-back. Dillon also went on to win one cap for the Republic of Ireland under-21 team, playing against the Czech Republic in a friendly in Olomouc in March 1998. Serious injury prevented him from winning any other international caps. Dillon was a first team regular for Rotherham for three and a half seasons, and had attracted notice from scouts of teams at Premiership and Championship level, before serious injury struck and Dillon drifted out of the professional game. Dillon's potential was recognised by the developers of the famous Championship Manager computer game. In the 1997/98 version of the game, Paul Dillon was one of the players with most potential. He was regularly included in lists of most valuable players and smartest buys for that version of the game.

It was created by President Nilo Pe√ßanha in 1910 in response to pressure from Marshal C√¢ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon and international accusations of indigenous genocide. It was the first federal agency in Brazil to focus on the protection of indigenous peoples from violence and persecution.  Influence of C√¢ndido Rondon  C√¢ndido Rondon was the first and most influential director of the agency, and was invited to the role by Brazilian Minister of Agriculture Rodolfo Miranda. He emphasized interacting with indigenous peoples in a peaceful way with the motto \\"Die if need be, but never kill.\\" His policies included protecting indigenous peoples from attacks, guaranteeing titles to the lands they occupied, and restoring lands previously usurped by whites. However, he also aimed to assimilate indigenous peoples into the Brazilian nation-state. In a letter accepting the invitation to become the first director of the SPI, he said \\"As a Positivist and member of the Positivist Church of Brazil, I am convinced that our indigenes should incorporate themselves into the West...\\" These ideas and policies shaped government relations with indigenous peoples for the next four decades. Under Rondon and Pe√ßanha‚Äôs leadership, legislation was created which attempted to secure the rights of indigenous people to their native lands and customs while also facilitating the establishment of new Brazilian settlements in indigenous regions.  Disbandment and recreation  Shortly after Rondon left the organization in 1915, it became ‚Äúriddled with corruption and double dealing,‚Äù however Rondon soon rejoined the agency and successfully made it somewhat honorable. However, by the early 1960s it was an international scandal, and it was disbanded in 1967.\\"What Future for the Amerindians of South America? Minority Rights Group Report 15\\" (PDF).

The film had its world premiere at the Illinois International Film Festival on Saturday, November 19, 2011, where it won the award for Best Dramatic Short.Illinois International Film Festival 2011 Award Winners Plot The Catastrophe is a surreal drama/mystery short film that uses dreamlike imagery, a Bob Dylan song and a poem by Forough Farrokhzad to paint a portrait of Dominicus Pike, the quintessential modern man. The movie follows Dominicus as he traverses the American midwest, plying his trade as a cigar salesman, and his dawning realization that he may have sold his soul to a multinational corporation. The main story of The Catastrophe is interwoven with narrative threads involving the collapse of Dominicus‚Äô relationship with his girlfriend, Carlie, and his discovery of what may be a murder plot involving one of his clients, Mohammad ‚ÄúDouble Apple‚Äù Akbari. Only life on the road alone makes it hard for Dominicus to distinguish where reality ends and dreams begin. History The Catastrophe was shot on high definition digital video in 4 days in the late summer of 2011. Shooting locations included Chicago, Villa Park and Des Plaines, Illinois. Aside from lead actor Peyton Myrick, a North Carolina-based theatrical actor, most of the rest of the cast are well known in the worlds of Chicago music, theater, television and independent film; the cast includes noted thespians Mia Park (host of television's Chic-a-Go-Go), Marla Seidell, Suzy Brack, and Duane Sharp (star of Zen Noir).

Only a comparatively small part of the head at term is represented by the face. The rest of the head is composed of the firm skull, which is made up of two frontal, two parietal, and two temporal bones, along with the upper portion of the occipital bone and the wings of the sphenoid. These bones are separated by membranous spaces, or sutures. The most important sutures are the frontal, between the two frontal bones; the sagittal, between the two parietal bones; the two coronal, between the frontal and parietal bones; and the two lambdoid, between the posterior margins of the parietal bones and upper margin of the occipital bone. Where several sutures meet, an irregular space forms, which is enclosed by a membrane and designated as a fontanel. The greater, or anterior fontanel, is a lozenge-shaped space that is situated at the junction of the sagittal and the coronal sutures. The lesser, or posterior fontanel, is represented by a small triangular area at the intersection of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. The localization of these fontanels gives important information concerning the presentation and position of the fetus. The temporal, or casserian fontanels, have no diagnostic It is customary to measure certain critical diameters and circumferences of the newborn head. The diameters most frequently used, and the average lengths thereof, are: #The occipitofrontal (11.5 cm), which follows a line extending from a point just above the root of the nose to the most prominent portion of the occipital bone. #The biparietal (9.5 cm), the greatest transverse diameter of the head, which extends from one parietal boss to the other. #The bitemporal (8.0 cm), the greatest distance between the two temporal sutures. #The occipitomental (12.5 cm), from the chin to the most prominent portion of the occiput. #The suboccipitobregmatic (9.5 cm), which follows a line drawn from the middle of the large fontanel to the undersurface of the occipital bone just where it joins the neck. The greatest circumference of the head, which corresponds to the plane of the occipitofrontal diameter, averages 34.5 cm, a size too large to fit through the pelvis without flexion. The smallest circumference, corresponding to the plane of the suboccipitobregmatic diameter, is 32 cm. The bones of the cranium are normally connected only by a thin layer of fibrous tissue that allows considerable shifting or sliding of each bone to accommodate the size and shape of the maternal pelvis. This intrapartum process is termed molding. The head position and degree of skull ossification result in a spectrum of cranial plasticity from minimal to great and in some cases, undoubtedly contribute to fetopelvic disproportion, a leading indication for cesarean delivery.

Following an audition for the role of Eva in John Huston's The Bible: In the Beginning..., she was noted by the producer Dino De Laurentiis who put her under contract for seven years, a contract she eventually broke after three years. Her first role was Ugo Tognazzi's wife in A Question of Honour, and following a few comedies, her early career was characterized by genre films, mainly Spaghetti Western, notably Sergio Corbucci's Navajo Joe. Starting from the late 1960s Machiavelli started appearing in more ambitious art films, working with Hans-J√ºrgen Syberberg, Pietro Germi, Dino Risi, Sergio Citti, Andrzej ≈ªu≈Çawski, and Liliana Cavani, among others. In 1984, Machiavelli became a disciple of Osho and retired from show business.

The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Kinosternon herrerai, p. 122).  Life history  Based on a 1988 study of a population near Rancho Nuevo in Tamaulipas, Mexico, the males of K. herrerai attain a larger size than females, with a proportionally smaller plastron, and narrower and shallower carapace. Symbionts reported include a balanomorph barnacle, leeches of the genus Phcobdelta, and the filamentous green alga Basichdia. The food items identified indicate an omnivorous diet, with wild figs the major plant component, and several insect orders and millipedes represented. Courtship in K. herrerai agrees in most respects with courtship of other kinosternid species. Sexual maturity in females is apparently attained between 115‚Äì130 mm carapace length. Clutch size is estimated to range from 2-4. Several clutches may be laid in a reproductive season. Geographic range K. herrerai is found in the Mexican states of Hidalgo, San Luis Potos√≠, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz. References Further reading *Stejneger, L.

Since then, the principles of this autopilot has been the basis of many different aircraft control systems, both military and civilian. Early development The Sperry Corporation developed the original gyroscopic autopilot in 1912. The device was called a ‚Äúgyroscopic stabilizer apparatus,‚Äù and its purpose was to improve stability and control of aircraft. It utilized the inputs from several other instruments to allow an aircraft to automatically maintain a desired compass heading and altitude. The key feature of the gyroscopic stabilizer apparatus was that it incorporated a gyroscope to regulate the control surfaces of the aircraft. Lawrence Sperry managed to design a smaller and lighter version of a gyroscope, and the device was integrated into an aircraft's hydraulic control system. Using a negative feedback loop, the gyroscope automatically adjusted the control surfaces of an aircraft to maintain straight and level flight. First use Lawrence Sperry's autopilot was first demonstrated in France on June 18, 1914. Sperry was participating in an exhibition in which 57 planes were fitted with new improvements and innovations. Sperry's aircraft, a Curtiss C-2, was the only one equipped with a gyroscopic stabilizer. Sperry, along with his assistant Emil Cachin, made three passes in front of a grandstand full of spectators and military observers. On his first pass, Sperry engaged the autopilot and flew past the grandstand with his hands held high off of the controls. On the second pass, Cachin climbed out onto the starboard wing seven feet away from the fuselage with Sperry's hands still off the controls. When the aircraft banked due to the shift in weight, the autopilot immediately stabilized the wings. On his final pass, Sperry climbed out onto the opposite wing, leaving the pilot seat empty. The observers were amazed at the aircraft's ability to maintain level flight without a pilot manually controlling it. Sperry also gave Joseph Barres, Commandant of the French Army Air Corps, a ride to demonstrate his device's ability to perform an unassisted takeoff and landing. Achievements Wiley Post became famous after his record setting trip around the world on June 23, 1931. In his aircraft, a Lockheed Vega nicknamed ‚ÄúWinnie Mae,‚Äù he managed to travel around the world in eight days 15 hours and 51 minutes. He accomplished this with the help of Harold Gatty, who served as his navigator and copilot. Two years later he set out to beat his previous record by flying around the world by himself. He wanted to prove that one man could accomplish the same trip without a copilot. In order to accomplish this, he equipped the Winnie Mae with a Sperry gyroscope autopilot and a radio direction finder. Although he experienced some problems with the autopilot, he completed the trip in seven days, 18 hours and 49 minutes. The use of the autopilot and radio direction finder is credited for making the task of navigating the aircraft much easier and more efficient. The use of an autopilot reduced the physical and mental demands on Post as he flew around the world. Early military applications The U.S. Army Air Corps and the U.S. Navy experimented with autopilots on military aircraft before and during World War II. Straight and level flight had become a necessity for new level bombing techniques that were being developed at the time. The Sperry Gyroscope Company developed many autopilot systems for use on military aircraft. When the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was delivered in the late 1930s, it came equipped a commercial Sperry A-3 Autopilot. The A-3 was a simple autopilot and only corrected angular deviations in the aircraft's straight and level course. It utilized pneumatic hydraulic servos, which had a tendency to react slowly to inputs, and this often led to overcompensation of the aircraft's corrected course. This caused navigation and control issues when pilots were flying in poor weather or rough air. To fix these problems, the Sperry A-5 autopilot was developed. This was the first all electric autopilot. This new autopilot used three dual-element vacuum tube amplifiers and high-speed gyros. Each amplifier was associated with a different axis: Yaw, pitch, and roll. The high-speed gyros were more sensitive and established a base reference level of the aircraft's level flight path. Whenever the aircraft deviated from the base reference level, the autopilot adjusted for the amount of time that occurred between the changes in reference levels. This allowed the autopilot to detect the velocity and acceleration of the change. The calculated change was then communicated quickly to the control surfaces by independent electro-hydraulic servos. This led to faster, more stable corrections of the aircraft. The faster stabilization of the aircraft by the A-5 autopilot made it possible for new bombsights to be used on military aircraft. The Norden Bombsight and Sperry Bombsight were both used onboard Army and Navy bombers during the war. Both bombsights used gyroscopes, telescopes and analog computers to calculate the release point for bombers to drop their payloads accurately onto ground targets. The A-5 had the ability to be integrated with these bombsights. Once the bombardier found the target and adjusted the bombsight, the autopilot would be engaged to fly the aircraft straight and level to the target, where the bombsight would automatically calculate the release point of the bombs. Missiles The German V-1 Buzz Bomb also used an autopilot system for guidance. It used a pendulum system that was damped by a gyroscope, similar to the ones used in Sperry autopilots. It also used radio direction finding to maintain course. The use of autopilot on unmanned weapons can be seen as the precursor to modern cruise missiles.

Her body of work encompasses photography, video, visual montages/collages, installations, architectural constructions, tapestries, sculptures and even perfume. Much of her work reflects her \\"concerns with Egypt's extremely alarming sociopolitical context.\\"  Work  Since 1997, she has been a member of the Arab Image Foundation (AIF), for which she directs magazine editorials and curates exhibitions and artist residencies. She curated the artist residency Fenenin el Rehal (Nomadic Artists) in Egypt's White Desert in 2006 Beyond the Image: Dorothy Schoene, 29 January 2013 at ibraaz.org; retrieved 6 October 2017 and participated in workshops and conferences around the world. Baladi is represented by the Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art in Cairo and IVDE Gallery in Dubai. Baladi received a Japan Foundation Fellowship in 2003 to research manga and anime in Tokyo. Among other global locations, she participated in the VASL residency program in Karachi, Pakistan in 2010. The breadth and variety of Baladi‚Äôs international experience influences her use of iconography drawn from numerous cultures.  Photo-montage  In 2000, she participated in The Desert, a group exhibition at Fondation Cartier in Paris with Om El Dounia (Mother of the World), a vast mosaic of photographs with highly saturated colors. This piece, while playful and with many references to pop culture, is also an exploration of the Biblical story of creation. In 2007, Baladi presented a work called Justice for the Mother, which depicts leaders of Arab countries. She considers it part of a series she calls \\"anthropological photography,\\" where she assembles series of photographs that tell a larger story. In this piece, Baladi draws from influences from both Western and Islamic traditions, creating \\"fantastical, playful surveys of history, culture and personal reflection.\\" Sandouk el Dounia (The World in a Box), is a huge composition of hundreds of scanned photographs. The name of the piece references traditional street theater for children in Cairo. Sandouk was presented in 2009 at the Queens Museum of Art's group exhibition Tarjama/Translationand in 2011 at the Venice Biennial's group show Penelope‚Äôs Labor: Weaving Words and Images. Reviewers called it \\"a giant tapestry version of a photo collage packed with images of action heroines\\".  Installations  An enormous installation titled \\"Al Fanous el Sehryn\\" (the Magic Lantern) was shown at the Townhouse Gallery in Cairo in 2003. The work consists of \\"a large eight-pointed star constructed of steel--approximately 23 feet in diameter--and a series of light boxes containing saturated colored images produced from x-ray photographs of a pregnant doll giving birth\\". The art suggests a cyclical nature where the images of the doll endlessly grow up and then giving birth over and over. The star shape was inspired by the chandeliers which hang in the mosque of Mohammed Ali in the Cairo Citadel. Her installation Roba Vecchia was presented in 2006 at the Townhouse Gallery in Cairo, in 2007 at the Sharjah Biennal and in 2009 at Arabesques, an exhibition of Arab contemporary art at the Kennedy Center in Washington and described as a \\"human-scale kaleidoscope\\", that \\"incorporated images from pop culture, then shattered them in constantly changing geometries\\", and in which \\"the participant becomes immersed in a psychedelic environment where rapidly yet systematically changing imagery engulfs the viewer\\". Borg el Amal (Tower of Hope), an ephemeral construction and sound installation, won the Grand Nile Award at the 2008/2009 Cairo Biennale. The inspiration for the tower comes from the slums surrounding Cairo known as ashwa'iyat (haphazard things). Her own tower in Borg el Amal was constructed of similar materials to the ashwa'iyat and allowed the audience to experience music under the oper sky. The entire installation is a challenge to \\"the censorship of the Mubarak era and addressed the state's ignorance of [that social plight],\\" which Baladi saw as a problem which she likened to a \\"ticking bomb about to explode.\\" She commissioned the Kiev Kamera Orchestra to perform the Donkey Symphony, Borg el Amal‚Äôs sound component, at the first Kiev Biennial in 2012. Coffee cups, presented in 2010 at Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde in Dubai has been considered both \\"playful\\" and inviting the viewer \\"into a world of contemplation and reflection\\".  Tahrir  During the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Baladi co-founded two media initiatives: Radio Tahrir and Tahrir Cinema. Both projects were inspired and informed by the eighteen days that toppled Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak‚Äôs, leadership. Radio Tahrir came about when Baladi and her friends, along with other like-minded people, started importing the equipment needed to start a pirate radio station. Radio Tahrir was the first free online radio in Egypt. Tahrir Cinema was co-founded with Mosireen, an Egyptian non-profit media initiative. The project served as a public platform to build and share a video archive on and for the revolution. The impetus to create Tahrir Cinema came from the chaos surrounding the second sit-in in Tahrir: \\"People were screaming and shouting on stages into microphones,\\" she says, \\"there was so much diffused information floating around, but no focus.\\" Her training as a visual artist helped her organize, show and share documents relating to the revolution using these platforms. Tahrir Cinema went live on July 14, 2011. The public experienced Tahrir Cinema as film shown on a screen constructed of wood and plastic in the main thoroughfare of the square. Surrounding the screen were rugs for people to sit on and areas for a larger standing crowd to view the footage. Lara Baladi created a collection of footage that included videos shot by activists directly involved in the revolution. She was very broad in her collecting, even showing \\"solidarity protests\\" from London. Being able to view and experience images and video taken by citizens in Egypt was an abrupt break with Mubarak's regime, where photography was prohibited in many areas of Egypt. Baladi writes, \\"people in the square took photos because they felt the social responsibility to do so...The camera became a nonviolent weapon aimed directly at the state, denouncing it.\\"  Continuing work  Baladi received a Fellowship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Open Documentary Lab for 2014 and 2015 in order to research, archive and create a transmedia activism project called Vox Populi, Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age. Vox Populi is a multimedia documentary that consists of an archive of articles, images and videos that Baladi had been gathering since January 25, 2011. Preserving the ephemera and the images of the revolution in Tahrir is important to Baladi. She writes that \\"most of the images of the 18 days [of protest] vanishing into a bottomless pit thanks to Google's PageRank algorithm, will the vision of a possible new world people glimpsed in [Tahrir] Square die along with its digital traces?\\" This expression of the fleeting nature of the digital world informs her current work.

The leading hypotheses propose the involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and/or the limbic system, with discoveries being made in the fields of neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, neuroimmunology, neurogenetics, and neuroethology.  Drug-induced OCD  Many different types of medication can create/induce pure OCD in patients that have never had symptoms before. A new chapter about OCD in the DSM-5 (2013) now specifically includes drug-induced OCD. Atypical antipsychotics (second generation antipsychotics), such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), have been proven to induce de-novo OCD in patients. Neuroanatomy Although there has been substantial debate regarding the assessment of OCD, current research has gravitated toward structural and functional neuroimaging. These technological innovations have provided a better understanding of the neuroanatomical risk factors of OCD. These studies can be divided into four basic categories: (1) resting studies that compare brain activity at rest in patients with OCD to controls, (2) symptom provocation studies that compare brain activity before and after incitement of symptoms, (3) treatment studies that compare brain activity before and after treatment with pharmacotherapy, and (4) cognitive activation studies that compare brain activity while performing a task in patients with OCD to controls.Maia, T. V., Cooney, R. E., & Peterson, B. S. (2008). The neural bases of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adults. Development and Psychopathology, 1251-1283. Data obtained from this research suggests that three brain areas are involved with OCD: the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the head of the caudate nucleus. Several studies have found that in patients with OCD, these areas: (1) are hyperactive at rest relative to healthy control; (2) become increasingly active with symptom provocation; and (3) no longer exhibit hyperactivity following successful treatment with SRI pharmacotherapy or cognitive-based therapy. This understanding is frequently cited as evidence that abnormality in these neuroanatomical regions may cause OCD. The OFC and ACC are intricately connected to the basal ganglia via the Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. Current theories suggests that OCD may be the result of an imbalance between the ‚Äúdirect‚Äù and ‚Äúindirect‚Äù pathways through the basal ganglia. The direct pathways are described as running from the cortex to the striatum, then to the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNr), then to the thalamus, and finally back to the cortex. The indirect pathways are described as running from the cortex to the striatum, then to the globus pallidus external segment (GPe), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the GPi and SNr, then thalamus, and finally back to the cortex. While the net effect of the direct pathway is excitatory, the net effect of the indirect pathway is inhibitory. Thus, it has been hypothesized that excessive relative activity in the direct pathway in OFC/ACC CBGTC loops may result in a positive feedback loop whereby obsessive thoughts are trapped. Although structural and functional neuroimaging studies have provided a strong basis for this supposition, it is still unclear why patients with OCD develop specific obsessions instead of a generalized obsessive behavior towards everything. While researchers have suggested that a response bias exists toward particular stimuli, such as contamination, the underlying cause is still unclear. Neurochemistry While there seems to be a ubiquitous understanding that neurochemical functioning is responsible for mediating the symptoms of OCD, recent psychopharmacologic studies have found that the serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system plays a particularly critical role. In comparison to healthy controls, the long-term administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to be more effective than noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of OCD. For example, Rapoport et al. demonstrated that clomipramine was more effective than desipramine in decreasing several types of repetitive behavior. Research has also shown that the administration of 5-HT antagonists often exacerbates symptoms of OCD. If this were to be true, one would expect mirtazapine (which among others is a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist) and atypical antipsychotics that also have antagonistic effects at this receptor to attenuate the effect of SSRIs. Clinical studies with these drugs, however, have shown the opposite. Mirtazapine, although not effective by itself, has been shown to hasten the effect of paroxetine (Pallanti et al., 2004), and several studies have shown that atypical antipsychotics augment the effects of SSRIs in refractory OCD patients (Bloch et al., 2006). While these findings do not provide an explicit cause, they do set the stage for the notion that psychiatric conditions can be dissected pharmacologically. Thus, the efficacy in controlling obsessions and compulsions with SSRIs suggests that OCD has an underlying neurochemical etiology. Dopaminergic systems are implicated in OCD by the efficacy of dopaminergic agents, the fact that PANDAS may be implicated, and by various neuroimaging studies. OCD may be treated with antipsychotic agents, however psychostimulants agents have also shown some promise in alleviating the symptoms of OCD. Although these need to be reconciled, they both implicate the dopaminergic systems. OCD also has a high comorbidity with ADHD, which is treated with psychostimulants and may result from increased phasic and decreased tonic signaling of dopaminergic neurons. PANDAS also affects the basal ganglia, where dopamine plays a large role as a neurotransmitter. Neuroimmunology Henrietta Leonard and Susan Swedo provide evidence for neuroimmunological risk factors in their article, ‚ÄúPaediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS).Leonard, H. L., & Swedo, S. E. (2001). Paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with treptococcal infection (PANDAS). International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology (4), 191-198‚Äù The researchers suggest that post-streptococcal autoimmunity may be a potential environmental cause of childhood onset OCD. In the 1980s, a large cohort of children with OCD were being evaluated prospectively. Following a streptococcal infection, a subgroup of children expressed OCD symptom exacerbations that were characterized as ‚Äúcoming on overnight.‚Äù The primary hypothesis derived from this study is that in some cases, OCD may develop as a consequence of an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies to streptococcal infections attack and damage the basal ganglia. Obsessions and compulsions are also very common in several other medical conditions, including: Tourette syndrome, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Huntington disease, encephalitis lethargica, Sydenham chorea, and damage to specific brain regions.Nestadt, G., Grados, M., & Samuels, J. F. (2010). Genetics of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 141-158. Similar to OCD, these disorders also exhibit abnormalities in the basal ganglia. This portion of the brain is responsible for mediating cognition, emotion, and movement. Disruption of the basal ganglia results in a host of symptoms that are characterized by compulsivity (behavioral patterns that are released repeatedly) and impulsivity (behavioral patterns that are released suddenly by various stimuli). This suggests that in patients with OCD, the disorder may be the result of abnormal functioning of the basal ganglia. Neurogenetics Studies suggesting Genetic Factors for OCD Twin studies and family association studies have demonstrated that there are definite genetic factors underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of family association studies demonstrated that at least some forms of OCD are familial. The rate of OCD among relatives of affected individuals was significantly higher than the estimated population prevalence of OCD and the rate among controls. Relatives of adults with OCD were approximately two times more likely to be affected than the controls, while relatives of children and adolescents with OCD were about ten times more likely to have OCD as well. However, that familial association could also have been caused by cultural or environmental factors. Currently, there have been very few studies investigating the environmental factors behind OCD. However, in a retrospective study of environmental risk factors, researchers found that prolonged labor and edema during pregnancy were correlated to OCD, suggesting that the environment plays some role in determining its manifestation. As a result, twin studies were performed to show that the symptoms of OCD are heritable and thus genetically related. Monozygotic, or identical, twins share 100% of their genes, while dizygotic, or fraternal, twins share on average 50% of their genes. The classic twin study compares monozygotic and dizygotic twins. If the monozygotic twins resemble each other much more closely than the dizygotic twins, then it is likely that genetics play a strong role in the development of the trait of interest. These studies showed that the genetic influences on obsessive- compulsive symptoms were 45 to 65% in children. The influence was less in adults, ranging from 27 to 47%. However, the results of the studies are complicated by the fact that the presence of individuals with OCD in the sample were frequently low. As a result, researchers oftentimes included individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptoms or subclinical OCD. By doing so, they possibly included subjects that were suffering from other, related disorders. Early twin studies were replicated later using twins with OCD meeting DSM criteria and ascertainment of probands, but only a few have been performed. Early Onset OCD Early onset OCD, manifesting in childhood or adolescence, is a subtype of OCD etiologically distinct from adult onset OCD. This early onset OCD is reported to be genetically related to tic disorders and Tourette syndrome, as one study has found that patients with early onset OCD have a higher rate of Tourette's and other tic disorders. Family association studies have suggested that early onset OCD is correlated to increased familial and possibly genetic risk. The rate of OCD and subclinical OCD among relatives of probands whose OCD manifested in childhood or adolescence was at least twice as high as the rate among relatives of probands whose OCD manifested in adulthood. Other studies have also indicated that there is an inverse relationship between the age of onset of the proband and the risk of OCD in relatives. Consequently, it is possible that there are different genetic mechanisms behind the two types of OCD; therefore, it may be necessary to control for age of onset when examining candidate genes. Candidate Gene SLC1A1 It is likely that a number of genes are important to the development of OCD. Some of those candidate genes have been identified but none of the candidate gene studies have been consistently replicated except those relating to the glutamate transporter gene, SLC1A1 (solute carrier family 1, member 1), which codes for the glutamate transporter, EAAC1. It has been suggested that the difficulties in identifying candidate genes may be related to the fact that most gene research has ignored environmental factors.[9] Consequently, it may be necessary to develop models for the interaction between genetic and environmental factors for certain subtypes of OCD to further genetic research. Three genome-wide association studies of OCD have also been completed, which have suggested potential regions of interest, including the region containing SLC1A1, 9p24. SLC1A1 is expressed in the cortex, striatum, and thalamus (the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuit) and is related to glutamate neurotransmission.Yoshikatsu Kanai and Matthias A. Hediger, \\"The glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter family SLC1: Molecular, Physiological, and Pharmacological aspects,\\" Pfl√ºgers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology 447, no. 5 (2003): 467-479. Neuroimaging, candidate gene, and animal model studies have provided evidence linking SLC1A1 and glutamate signaling to the occurrence of OCD. Neuroimaging studies have found that caudate glutamatergic concentrations are lower in the anterior cingulate and higher in the caudate in early onset OCD patients compared to controls, suggesting that glutamate transport (and in turn, the glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1) is related to the onset of OCD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene SLC1A1 have consistently been found to be related to OCD. In addition to glutamate transport, EAAC1, the transporter coded by SLC1A1, has also been linked to GABA synthesis, which could promote susceptibility to OCD. An initial study demonstrated a significant association between OCD and 3 linked polymorphisms in the SLC1A1 gene. This result has been replicated in numerous studies. One study tested for four SNPs in the SLC1A1 gene in individuals with early-onset OCD in a Han Chinese population and found that one SNP, rs10491734, was significantly more frequent in OCD patients than in controls. However, the exact SNPs identified in the different studies vary, though it is possible that this is because the studies were conducted on different ethnic populations. For example, a family-based association study analyzed the instances of SNPs in and around SLC1A1 in families from throughout the US and found that a different SNP, rs4740788, and a 3-SNP haplotype, rs4740788-rs10491734-rs10491733, were both related to OCD. Several mouse models have been developed for the study of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Model organisms are useful for allowing aspects of some psychiatric disorders in one species (in this case, humans) to be explored in other species (in this case, mice). Notably, SLC1A1 null mice demonstrated compulsive behaviors by exhibiting increased aggression and excessive self- grooming resulting in fur loss. However, since these were only two behaviors loosely linked to OCD, this did not provide strong evidence for the relation between the loss of EAAC1 and OCD-like behaviors. Given the strong correlation between the gene SLC1A1 and OCD, this suggests that the lack of EAAC1 only results in OCD-like behaviors when it is combined with other rare mutations in genes related to the CSTC, or cortico-striato-thalamocortical, circuit. Neuroethology The vast monolith of psychiatric research has placed an emphasis on proximate mechanisms as the cause for illness. In contrast, evolutionary theory has engendered questions regarding how distal mechanisms may be implicated with pathogenesis. OCD involves several behavioral schemata that may have been preserved over evolutionary history. Numerous species have inherited cognitive patterns that lend to checking for danger, avoiding contamination, and hoarding food.O'Connor, J. J. (2008). A Flaw in the Fabric. Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy, 87-96. Theorists have hypothesized that a dysfunction in any of these strategies could lead to the expression of OCD. This conjecture is further supported by evidence that such inherited, species- specific strategies are stored in the basal ganglia. Lick granuloma from excessive licking When considering the expression of OCD in non-human species, researchers have studied acral lick dermatitis (also known as lick granuloma) in large canines. This disorder is characterized by excessive licking or scratching that leads to alopecia (hair loss) and subsequent granulomatous lesions (vascular tissue on the surface of a wound). Rapoport et al. found that this obsessive-compulsive behavior was alleviated in afflicted canines after administering clomipramine. Thus, it is conceivable that evolutionary selected traits could become maladaptive proceeding neurological dysfunction.

Process  The process consists of heating a mixture of silicon dioxide (SiO2), in the form of silica or quartz sand, and carbon, in its elemental form as powdered coke, in an iron bowl. In the furnace, the silicon dioxide, which sometimes also contains other additives, is melted surrounding a graphite rod, which serves as a core. An electric current is passed through the graphite, which heats the mixture to 1700‚Äì2500 ¬∞C. The result of the carbothermic reaction is a layer of silicon carbide (especially in its alpha and beta phases) forming around the rod and emission of carbon monoxide (CO). There are four chemical reactions in the production of silicon carbide: #C + SiO2 ‚Üí SiO + CO #SiO2 \\\\+ CO ‚Üí SiO + CO2 #C + CO2 ‚Üí 2CO #SiO + 2C ‚Üí SiC + CO This overall process is highly endothermic, with a net reaction of: :SiO2 \\\\+ 3C + 625.1 kJ ‚Üí Œ±-SiC + 2 CO  Discovery  In 1890 Acheson attempted to synthesize diamond but ended up creating blue crystals of silicon carbide that he called carborundum. He found that the silicon vaporized when overheated, leaving graphite. He also discovered that when starting with carbon instead of silicon carbide, graphite was produced only when there was an impurity, such as silica, that would result in first producing a carbide. He patented the process of making graphite in 1896. After discovering this process, Acheson developed an efficient electric furnace based on resistive heating, the design of which is the basis of most silicon carbide manufacturing today.  Commercial Production  Diagram of a resistive Acheson furnace for producing electrode rods formed from powdered coke mixed with silica clay. a - Mixture of Coke and Sand, b - Bricks, c - Carbon Electrodes, d - Refractory Material, e - Rods to Graphitize, f - Granulated Coke The first commercial plant using the Acheson process was built by Acheson in Niagara Falls, New York, where hydroelectric plants nearby could cheaply produce the necessary power for the energy intensive process. By 1896, The Carborundum Company was producing 1 million pounds of carborundum. Many current silicon carbide plants use the same basic design as the first Acheson plant. In the first plant, sawdust and salt were added to the sand to control purity. The addition of salt was eliminated in the 1960s, due to it corroding steel structures. The addition of sawdust was stopped in some plants to reduce emissions. Diagram of related Castner lengthwise graphization furnace, legend is same as for the Acheson furnace To manufacture synthetic graphite items, carbon powder and silica are mixed with a binder, such as tar, and baked after being pressed into shape such as that of electrodes or crucibles. They are then surrounded with granulated carbon acting as a resistive element that heats them. In the more efficient Castner lengthwise graphitization furnace, the items to be graphitized, e.g. rods, are heated directly by placing them lengthwise end-to-end in contact with the carbon electrodes so that current flows through them, and the surrounding granulated carbon acts as a thermal insulator, but otherwise the furnace is similar to the Acheson design. To finish the items, the process is run for approximately 20 hours at with a starting current of () for a furnace approximately 9 meters long by 35 cm in width and 45 cm in depth, and the resistance drops as the carbon heats due to a negative temperature coefficient, causing the current to increase. Cool down takes weeks. The purity of graphite achievable using the process is 99.5%.  Uses  Silicon carbide was a useful material in jewelry making due to its abrasive properties, and this was the first commercial application of the Acheson process. The first light emitting diodes were produced using silicon carbide from the Acheson process. The potential use of silicon carbide as a semiconductor led to the development of the Lely process, which was based on the Acheson process, but allowed control over the purity of the silicon carbide crystals. The graphite became valuable as a lubricant and for producing high purity electrodes.

P.8 was a fighter designed by Ing. Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski and constructed by P.Z.L. (Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady Lotnicze - National Aviation Establishments) from 1930. Design and development The P.8 was loosely based on the P.1, retaining the slab-sided fuselage and strut braced gull wing characteristic of Pulawski's fighters throughout the 1930s. Despite official preference toward radial engines Pulawski won authority to develop a new fighter powered by V-12 engines up to . The two fighter designs which emerged were designated P.8 and P.9, re-using the designations of two seaplane designs that had been rejected by the Polish Navy. Two power-plants were fitted to the two prototypes; the P.8/I was fitted with a Hispano-Suiza 12Mc; the P.8/II was fitted with a Lorraine 12Hfrs P√©trel Chasse. The airframe of the P.8 continued Pulawski's theme of semi-monocoque stressed skin Aluminium alloy structure with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings were built up around two I-section Aluminium alloy spars with alloy ribs and finely corrugated sheet Duralumin. High set gull style wings were attached to the upper fuselage with about 5 degrees dihedral out to the joint between centre-section and outer wings which had zero dihedral. Support for the wings came from pairs of struts attached to the lower fuselage and at the thickest section of the outer wings at about 1/3span. A fixed tail-wheel undercarriage consisted of strut mounted mainwheels attached to the fuselage at the wing strut attachment points and a steel shod tail-skid. Cooling for the engine was achieved by a large radiator bath under the rear fuselage on the P.8/I and by special surface heat exchangers under the rear fuselage of the P.8/II. The special heat exchangers caused cooling difficulties and were replaced by small radiators either side of the rear fuselage aft of the cockpit. Flight testing of the first prototype began in 1931, with the second prototype following in 1932, competing in that year's International Air Meeting in Warsaw and the 1932 Salon de l'Aeronautique at Paris. The P.8/I was also due to appear at the 1932 Zurich Meeting, replacing the P.8/II but was damaged beyond repair during a landing at Innsbruck.
