His maternal grandparents were João Inácio Homem da Costa Noronha—a wealthy landowner, farmer, and soldier from an illustrious Angra do Heroísmo family—and Clara Mariana Xavier de Noronha Côrte-Real.Martins Zuquete (1989): p. 212 During his life Terra Brum became one of Faial's largest landowners. As titleholder to landed estates, he was known as a morgado.Ribeiro (2007): p. 163 His properties were situated along the Ribeira da Conceição (literally, Stream of the Immaculate Conception) and the so-called Alagoa coastline in what were then the outskirts of the city of Horta, Faial. He also owned and maintained winegrowing properties on neighboring Pico Island, where he was one of the largest producers of Verdelho wine. Throughout his life he served in various of the Kingdom of Portugal's public positions, including lieutenant colonel of local militias, knight of the Portuguese Military Order of Christ, knight of the Royal House of Portugal from 30 April 1794 onward, Captain-Mor of Faial from 14 March 1818 onward, and as a fidalgo of the Portuguese monarchy's privy council from January 1834 onward.

Following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the city was rebuilt under the instructions of Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal. The reconstruction included the development of a park, oriented south-east to north-west, known as the Passeio Público. The park's borders rapidly became a popular location for the elite to build their homes and, over time, it was considered necessary for a road to be built through the park. The Avenida da Liberdade was completed in 1886. The Teatro Avenida opened on 11 February 1888 and until 1906 was the only entertainment facility on the Avenida da Liberdade. It had a very simple appearance, with little architectural distinction. On the ground floor of the façade were four wooden doors, while on the first floor there was an iron balcony across the width of the façade. The initial reception of the interior by Lisbon's newspapers was very positive although, over the years, it became criticised for being small, cramped and lacking in suitable emergency exits. In part, this criticism may have been because an additional 96 seats were added in the 20th century. Theatre companies occupying the Teatro Avenida often experienced difficulties in making a profit, particularly in its early years. Almost all genres passed through the theatre, but it found it easier to fill the house for operettas, variety shows, farces, comedies, and sentimental dramas. It had its greatest public and commercial successes in the 1920s and 1930s with popular shows, such as those put on by the Satanela-Amarante company and the Maria Matos- Mendonça de Carvalho company, and with plays involving such stars as Palmira Bastos, , and . Other actors to perform there included Beatriz Costa, Eunice Muñoz, João Villaret, Laura Alves and Vasco Santana. By the 1950s, however, serious consideration was being given to the future of Teatro Avenida. The owner had announced his intention to sell the building and had tried, without success, to evict the tenant. There were several proposals regarding what to do with the site, including one that involved the construction of a larger, modern theatre. In 1964 the Rey Colaço-Robles Monteiro theatre company moved into the theatre following the destruction by fire of the D. Maria II National Theatre, which it was then occupying. It carried out some remodelling as the Avenida had suffered from considerable neglect. Amélia Rey Colaço, the actress and impresario, used much of her own money in this upgrading and the theatre reopened on 6 February 1965 to a favourable reception, with the Diário de Lisboa noting that it was \\"newly dressed to hide its old age\\", stating that it had been transformed into a small theatre in the style of Paris. In less than three years, however, the Avenida was also destroyed by fire, which broke out 30 minutes before a performance of The Birthday Party by Harold Pinter was due to begin on 13 December 1967. The cause of the fire was believed to have been an electrical fault. The theatre was completely destroyed, with the firefighters having been hindered by a lack of water pressure. In September 1970 the Lisbon municipality approved the demolition of the building and it was replaced by an office building.

Bernd Arnold (born 28 February 1947) is a German rock climber and mountaineer. He is known for more than 900 first ascents in the East German Saxon Switzerland climbing region. During the 1970s and 1980s he established most of the hardest routes of the region and became one of the most influential German climbers of his era. He is well-known for climbing barefoot, even on very hard routes.  Personal Life  Bernd Arnold grew up in the small East German town of Hohnstein, where he still lives today. Arnold is a professional letterpress printer and now owns two mountaineering equipment stores. He also offers climbing courses in his home region. He is married and has one daughter.  Climbing Career  His first remarkable ascent was the Route Zehn (VIIIc) at Meurerturm in 1966, when he was only 19 years old. In 1970 he climbed the Nordwand at the rock tower Schwager in the Schrammsteine area and achieved a difficulty of grade IXb. This might have been the hardest free climbing route in the world at the time. First ascents such as the Nonplusultra (IXb) at Mittlerer Torstein, Talseite (IXb) at Teufelsspitze and Lineal (IXa) at Meurerturm followed. In 1977 Arnold was the first to climb grade IXc when he achieved his first ascent of Direkte Superlative at Großer Wehlturm. In the early 1980s developments in sport climbing pushed into ever harder territories. Inspired by the growing international competition at the top level of the climbing world, Arnold managed to reach the difficulty of Xa in 1982 and Xb im 1983. His first ascents of Barometer für Stimmungen at Heringstein and Garten Eden at Rokokoturm, both Xc, marked the climax of his rock climbing career in 1986. After the Peaceful Revolution of 1989 Arnold was able to travel to many mountain regions around the world. During the Cold War era, he was only in a few exceptional cases allowed to pursue climbing and mountaineering outside the Eastern Bloc. Nevertheless, he became close friends with West German climbers Kurt Albert and Wolfgang Güllich, who visited the Saxon Switzerland in the early 1980s and managed to repeat some of Arnold's hardest routes. With Kurt Albert he later undertook expeditions to Patagonia and the Karakorum. Arnold remains an active climber today and is a proponent of reforming the very strict traditional climbing regulations of the Saxon Switzerland area. In 2008, he was awarded an honorary citizenship by his hometown of Hohnstein.  References   Sources  * Bernd Arnold: Zwischen Schneckenhaus und Dom.

The rose was named in honour of the Silver Jublilee of Queen Elizabeth in 1977. The rose was awarded the Royal National Rose Society's President's International Trophy, the Belfast Gold medal, the Portland Gold Medal and the James Mason Memorial Prize. Description 'Silver Jubillee' is a hybrid tea rose, It is a medium sized shrub, 3 to 4 ft (90-120 cm) in height, with a 2 to 3 ft (60-90 cm) spread. Blooms have an average diameter of 5 inches (12 cm) and can have up to 40 petals. The rose has a large, full, high-centered bloom form. The color is apricot blend, varying from pink to apricot, and salmon with shades of peach. 'Silver Jubilee' blooms in flushes from spring to fall, but does not thrive in warmer climates. The plant has dark, glossy green leaves. History =James Cocker & Sons= James Cocker & Sons was established by James Cocker (1807-1880) in 1841 in Aberdeen, Scotland. He initially sold forest trees and herbaceous plants. Cocker's son, James (1832-1897), took over the company when his father died in 1880. Cocker's three sons, William, James and Alexander, joined the company in the 1880s. With the growing popularity of roses, the Cockers initiated a rose breeding program in the early 1890s. The three sons took over the management of the company after Cocker's death in 1897. The nursery's first commercially successful rose variety was 'Mrs. Cocker' (1899). Alexander became the sole owner of the company after the deaths of his two brothers. Alexander Cocker died in 1920 and the company was passed to his two young children, Margaret and Alexander Morison (Alec) (1907-1977), through a trust. The business was dissolved in 1923. Alec Cocker reestablished the company as a general nursery in 1936. He rented a field in Aberdeen and initially grew perennials and roses. During the Second World War, Cocker joined the Civil Defence Service, where he met Anne Rennie (1920-2014). Cocker and Anne became engaged, and after the war formed a new nursery business using Anne's £80 war grant. Alec and Anne began specialising in growing and breeding roses in the 1960s. Their first rose varietes include, 'Morning Jewel' (1968), and 'White Cockade' (1969). The hybrid tea, 'Alec's Red' (1970), was awarded the Royal National Rose Society's (RNRS) President's International Trophy in 1970. =Silver Jubilee= Alec Cocker's most famous rose variety was the hybrid tea, 'Silver Jubilee'. The new rose variety was named with permission of the Queen to commemorate her 25-year reign. The rose was created from a cross between (floribunda, 'Highlight' and hybrid tea, 'Colour Wonder) and (floribunda, 'Parkdirector Riggers' and hybrid tea, 'Piccadilly'). The new rose made its debut at the 1977 Chelsea Flower Show. Alec died of a heart attack in 1977 and did not live to see his rose's success. Anne introduced the rose commercially in Britain in 1978. 'Silver Jubilee' won the Royal National Rose Society (RNRS) President's International Trophy (Britain) in 1977, the Portland Gold Medal (USA) in 1981, the Belfast Gold Medal (Northern Ireland) in 1985 and the James Mason Memorial Prize (Britain) in 1981. =Annne Cocker= After Alec's death, Anne managed the company until she was in her eighties. She continued the rose breeding program, developing new rose varieties, including 'Remember Me' (1979), 'Braveheart' (1993), and 'Heart of Gold' (2001). She won multiple horticultural awards during her career. She died in 2014.

He was the inspiration behind the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT), which aims to educate communities across the UK about stem cell, blood and organ donation. His parents, Beverley De-Gale and Orin Lewis, set up the ACLT to help find new black donors after being told that Daniel's odds of finding a match were around 1 in 250,000.  Life  Daniel was diagnosed with a type of leukaemia (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) in 1993, when he was six years old. After two years of intensive chemotherapy and other cancer treatments, his family were told that he was cancer free. But nine months later, the cancer had returned and doctors believed the best treatment would be a stem cell transplant. Daniel's younger sister and other family members were tested, but no-one was a match. Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital began to look for a match through the World bone marrow register, but said that the odds of finding a match were around 1 in 250,000. In response, Daniel's parents, Beverley De-Gale and Orin Lewis, set up the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT) to help find new Black donors. In 1999, doctors found a match in Doreene Carney, a donor from Detroit, Michigan and Daniel became the first black person in the UK to receive a stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor. Six months later, he was back at school. Daniel's cancer came back 2 years later, requiring another course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. He went on to get 12 GCSEs. Six years after the transplant, Daniel started to experience complications, developing vitiligo and extreme fatigue. He received a blood transfusion, which improved his health for a few months, but then his red blood cell count dropped again. During this period, Daniel gained 3 A levels and went off to study Sports Physiotherapy at University, hoping to be qualified before the 2012 Olympics in London. After a series of treatments at the University College Hospital for haemolytic anaemia and other complications, Daniel died from multi-organ failure aged 21.  Legacy  The ACLT continues to work to educate communities across the UK, helping to increase the number of Black donors in the UK from around 550 in 1996 to almost 20,000 in 2006. In one year, the trust registered 196 organ donors, 432 blood donors and 1915 potential donors to the UK stem cell register. According to their website, the trust has registered over 4,000 organ donors since 2010. Daniel's parents were honoured with a special recognition award at the 8th Pride of Britain Awards in November 2006 for their work and were awarded OBEs in 2014.

He was the brother of Huan Wen and Huan Chong. Although not as influential as his two brothers, Huan Huo was one of the members of the Huan clan who held control over a province in Jingzhou after the death of Huan Wen. His sons such as Huan Shiqian and Huan Shixiu were also important members of the clan who earned merits under Huan Wen and Huan Chong's leadership. He fought against Former Qin forces expanding into Jin's western territories before dying in 377.  Early Career  Huan Huo was the third son to the Eastern Jin general Huan Yi, who died when Huo was only 8 years old. Compared to his brothers Wen and Chong, he had very little reputation to him. He first served as an Assistant Officer of the Household to the regent Sima Yu and later his libulang (吏部郎). Huan Huo resigned from the government due to illness but later returned to office when Huan Wen became Gentleman of the Yellow Gate in 361. Huan Huo became seven commandaries along the Mian River along with Administrator of Xinye and Yicheng. Shortly after this, Huan Huo attacked Xuchang and captured it from Former Yan.(夏四月，太尉桓溫鎮宛，使其弟豁將兵取許昌。) Book of Jin, Volume 8 In 365, Huan Huo was further promoted to Chief of military affairs in Yicheng commandary of Jingzhou and Yangzhou, and Jingzhao commandary in Yongzhou, and acting Inspector of Jingzhou. He was also gifted staffs of authority together with his brother Huan Chong.(二月乙未，以右將軍桓豁監荊州揚州之義城雍州之京兆諸軍事、領南蠻校尉、荊州刺史；桓沖監江州荊州之江夏隨郡豫州之汝南西陽新蔡潁川六郡諸軍事、南中郎將、江州刺史，領南蠻校尉，並假節。) Book of Jin, Volume 8 The following year in 366, Huan Huo quelled the rebellion of the Inspector of Liangzhou, Sima Xun. Later, he repelled a Former Qin raid in Jingzhou led by Wang Meng, Yang An and Yao Chang, although he lost a portion of the people living along the Han River who were relocated to Qin. The general Zhao Yi (趙億) had also rebelled at Wan that year, so Huan Huo and Luo Chong (羅崇) campaigned against him in 367. Huan Huo drove out Zhao Yi and captured the Yan general sent to help Zhao Yi, Zhao Pan (趙盤).(荊州刺史桓豁、竟陵太守羅崇攻宛，拔之。趙億走，趙盤退歸魯陽。豁追擊盤於雉城，擒之，留兵戌宛而還。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 101  After Huan Wen's death  For the next six years, Huan Huo's brother Huan Wen schemed his way to claim the imperial throne, first through a failed campaign in Yan and then forcing Emperor Fei of Jin to abdicate. In 373, Huan Wen died, never becoming emperor but leaving behind a dynasty monopolised by his clan. Huan Wen's domain were divided into three between Huan Chong, Huan Huo and Huo's son Huan Shixiu. Huan Huo was made General Who Conquers The West and Commander of military affairs in Jingzhou, Yangzhou, Yongzhou, Jiaozhou, and Guangzhou after his passing while the rest of the clan also received important positions.(庚戌，加右將軍、荊州刺史桓豁征西將軍，督荊、楊、雍、交、廣五州諸軍事。以江州刺史桓沖為中軍將軍、都督揚、豫、江三州諸軍事、揚、豫二州刺史，鎮姑孰；竟陵太守桓石秀為寧遠將軍、江州刺史，鎮尋陽。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 103 Although the Huan clan now controlled most of southern China, it now faced a threat from Former Qin, whose ruler Fu Jian wanted to unify the whole of China. Qin forces invaded Yizhou and Liangzhou shortly after Huan Wen's death. Huan Huo attempted to save the provinces by sending Zhu Yao (竺瑤) but Zhu Yao could not advance after hearing that his ally Zhao Zhang (趙長) had already been killed. As a result, the provinces were swiftly taken by Qin in 373.(荊州刺史桓豁遣江夏相竺瑤救梁、益；瑤聞廣漢太守趙長戰死，引兵退。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 103 In 376, Huan Huo was promoted to Senior General Who Attacks the West and given the privilege of Separate Office, allowing him to appoint anyone without the court's permission. However, it was around this time that Huan Huo wanted to resign, stating his failure in saving Yizhou and Liangzhou for his reasoning, but the court denied. In 377, Huan Huo appointed Zhu Xu Inspector of Liangzhou and stationed him at Xiangyang. Huan Huo died not long after the same year and his titles were all given to his brother Huan Chong. He was posthumously named as 'Jing'.(豁以威略不振，所在覆敗，又上疏陳謝，固辭，不拜開府。尋卒，時年五十八。贈司空，本官如故，諡曰敬。贈錢五十萬，布五百匹，使者持節監護喪事。豁時譽雖不及沖，而甚有器度。但遇強寇，故功業不建。) Book of Jin, Volume 74  Anecdotes  Huan Huo had a habit of naming his children with two-syllable names, all starting with the word 'stone (shi, 石)'. This was due to a children's song around the time, which included the lyrics \\"Who is spoken of as strong, a stone will strike and smash.\\" The word 'strong (jian, 堅)' is the same as Fu Jian's given name so Huan Huo prophethised that by naming his sons with 'shi', Fu Jian's demise would be certain. As a result, all 20 of his sons had the word 'shi' in their names although only six were recorded. They were Huan Shiqian, Huan Shixiu, Huan Shimin, Huan Shisheng (桓石生), Huan Shisui (桓石綏) and Huan Shikang (桓石康).(初，豁聞符堅國中有謠云：「誰謂爾堅石打碎。」有子二十人，皆以「石」為名以應之。唯石虔、石秀、石民、石生、石綏、石康知名。) Book of Jin, Volume 74 = \\"The Talking Robin\\" = Huan Huo once owned a robin, which was given to him by one of his men during his time as Inspector of Jingzhou. Huan Huo supposedly managed to teach it how to speak, allowing it to roughly imitate human words. He once presented it to his men and made it imitate whatever the guests were saying. One day, someone in the army was stealing from Huan Huo's camp and was saw by the robin. The robin notified Huan Huo's men but though they noticed, they did not report it to Huan Huo. The thief came back soon enough, this time stealing beef. The robin caught him once more and alerted the army. This time the army listened to it but demanded proof. The robin said \\"The man wrapped the beef with fresh lotus leaves, and hid it behind the folding screen.\\" The soldiers went to inspect, and surely enough it was like what the robin had said. The thief's stolen goods were confiscated and was punished. The thief bore resentment towards the robin, so he had it boiled alive. Huan Huo became depressed, and his men urged him to kill the thief. However, Huan Huo said, \\"You musn't impose the death penalty on a person who is not guilty of death because of a bird, regardless of legal principles.\\" Instead, Huan Huo punished him accordingly by shaving his head, an ancient form of humiliation, and must remain shaved for five years.(晉司空桓豁在荊州，有司空翦五月五日鴝鵒舌，教令學語，遂無所不名，與人相問。顧參軍善彈琵琶，鴝鵒每立聽移時。又善能效人語笑聲。司空大會吏佐，令悉效四座語，無不絕似。有生齆鼻，語難學，學之不似，因內頭於甕中以效焉，遂與齆者語聲不異。主典人於鴝鵒前盜物，參軍如廁，鴝鵒伺無人，密白主典人盜某物，將軍銜之而未發。後盜牛肉，鴝鵒復白，參軍曰：「汝雲盜肉，應有驗。」鴝鵒曰：「以新荷裹著屏風後。」檢之，果獲，痛加治，而盜者患之，以熱湯灌殺。參軍為之悲傷累日，遂請殺此人，以報其怨。司空教曰：「原殺鴝鵒之痛，誠合治殺，不可以禽鳥故，極之於法。」令止五歲刑也。) You Minglu, Volume 3  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.)

It was assigned the ordinal number 324, but was no longer known as the 324th Infantry Division after 10 March 1945. The division existed only in early March 1945.  History  Infantry Division Hamburg was formed as an emergency formation on 4 March 1945 in Wehrkreis X. It initially consisted of the Grenadier Regiments 588 and 589 (formerly Grenadier Regiment Hamburg 1 and Grenadier Regiment Hamburg 2, respectively), consisting of two battalions each, as well as the Division Fusilier Battalion 324, the Artillery Regiment 324 (two artillery detachment), and the Division Units 324. The division's only commander during its history was Walter Steinmüller. Deployment was completed by 8 March 1945, and the division was rushed into the Wesel sector. Upon arrival in the region on 10 March, the fighting formations of the division were immediately folded into local units, whereas the staff and signals detachment remained nominally independent.

Among the series' executive producers is deaf activist, model, and actor Nyle DiMarco. According to DiMarco, the goal of the series is \\"to show deaf people as humans, from all walks of life.\\" The series was released on October 9, 2020 on Netflix. Production Nyle DiMarco, a deaf model who graduated from Gallaudet in 2013, has won reality television competitions America's Next Top Model and Dancing with the Stars. Following the wins and having his deaf identity spotlighted, he sought to create a series featuring Gallaudet students to show a variety of deaf experiences, including students from signing deaf families and students who arrived on campus not knowing sign language. DiMarco cited the inspiration for the series to be conversations with friends while attending Gallaudet about a reality television show reflecting their unique college experience. He said that while on spring break students from elsewhere were interested in partying with him and his friends and learning about deaf culture and sign language. During the development process, the casting department sought to cast students who had strong culturally deaf identities. DiMarco encouraged also casting students who had not grown up in deaf culture so different stories could be told and compared. He said with the final cast, \\"They knew that it was going to be on Netflix, but they weren't sure if this was something that would really tell their story.... They were worried that the show could potentially cause them some harm in the future.\\" One of the students, Daequan, hesitated to be involved with the series, not feeling \\"deaf enough\\", but DiMarco said he found Daequan's story pertinent to include. Variety reported one of the producers, Naimah Holmes, sharing \\"that it was a challenge for the creative team to find students who were willing to both spare their time and be vulnerable in front of the camera\\". On the lack of black women in the cast, she said the crew did not want to force that \\"into the group based on need for diversity as a token\\" and hoped to feature more women of color if a second season was greenlighted. Deaf U was produced by Hot Snakes Media. Eric Evangelista and Shannon Evangelista from Hot Snakes served as executive producers alongside DiMarco and Brandon Panaligan. DiMarco said he intended that a significant portion of the crew be deaf, aiming for 30%, and said that the final portion turned out to be an unprecedented 50%. In July 2020, Netflix ordered the documentary series. Cast *Cheyenna Clearbrook *Rodney Burford *Tessa Lewis *Alexa Paulay-Simmons *Renate Rose *Daequan Taylor *Dalton Taylor Episodes  Reception  TV Guides Megan Vick said Deaf U is \\"an immediately engaging series thanks to the excellent casting\\" and compared the docuseries to Netflix's Cheer and Love on the Spectrum. Vick commended Deaf U in how it \\"expertly balances unscripted hallmarks... with heart\\". The critic summarized, \\"The hook of Deaf U is obviously the inside look at how a community has created a rich and dynamic culture with an identity that the outside world has often only considered a disability, and the show delivers on that front. The reason to stay though is that the true value of the show is in getting to know these students as the beautiful work-in-progresses that they are and get invested in who they are aiming to become.\\" Inkoo Kang of The Hollywood Reporter said Deaf U was \\"more impressive as a representational leap than as a reality series\\". Kang did not find the series \\"particularly involving\\" beyond \\"the discussion of deaf politics and culture\\". The critic noted, \\"The heavy focus on demographic diversity — and the Elite girls — does render the near- complete lack of women of color rather conspicuous.\\" Kang found the episodes too short to explore potentially \\"ambitious material\\", \\"never quite delivering on emotional impact or entertainment value\\". The critic summarized, \\"Deaf U illustrates aplenty that deaf kids can be hornily confused, too. But more context would have made its representational milestones more satisfying.\\" Aaron Barnhart, reviewing for Primetimer, said Deaf U \\"will strike you at first as exceedingly trivial, another MTV-style docuseries about sex and drinking among collegiates\\". Barnhart said, \\"I think the program's overarching interest in its subjects' sex lives — rather than their academic pursuits and life goals — will strike many as the exact opposite of a deep or layered treatment.\\" He found Deaf U to have \\"intriguing characters, and fascinating exploration of deaf subculture — albeit one that doesn't exactly cast deaf people in a very favorable light — is a worthwhile drive-by docuseries\\". NPR's Eric Deggans described Deaf U as \\"a series whose rebelliousness is embodied in the wordplay of its title, shines most when it shows how typical challenges college students face are amplified by the unique contours of Deaf culture\\". The critic said, \\"'Deaf U' deftly explores these gossipy coming-of-age challenges - how to be true to yourself without hurting others, how to bring something new into your life, like hearing aids or cochlear implants, without being judged by those who see such changes as turning away from your identity as a Deaf person.\\" Deggans said he was generally cynical about docuseries as reductionist and concluded, \\"But if the moments shown in 'Deaf U' are true, it's a fascinating look at a community rarely seen with such depth and humanity on television.\\" For the series, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 10/10.\\" Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 5 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Her first work, En ung Piges Historie (1861), a typically Danish governess novel, was a huge success selling some 50,000 copies in several editions and translations. Becoming increasingly religious in her writing, she published many more novels and short stories until 1908, some of them running to several editions. Early life Born on 14 January 1836 in Ringkøbing, Cornelia Frederikke Juliane Victorine von Levetzow was the daughter of the customs accountant Diedrich Vilhelm von Levetzow (1786–1849) and Edle Vilhelmine Fog (1793–1872). The youngest of five children, she was taught at home by her mother and her sisters Mathilde and Vilhelmine who also became writers. She lived in her parents' home in Ringkøbing until the family moved to Copenhagen after her father's death, finally settling in Lyngby in 1854. Career Her literary career began when she was 24 with En ung Pige's Historie (A Young Girl's Story, 1860) inspired by Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre. Like several other Scandinavian novels in the mid-19th century, it tells how a women experiences hardship after seeking work as a governess outside the home but finally returns home to begin a happy life. It was a huge success, running to eight editions in Danish by the end of the 19th century and translated into several other languages. The following year she published two more books, Fem Fortællinger (Five Tales, 1861) and Tre Fortællinger (Three Tales, 1861), although she had in fact written them before En ung Piges Historie. They also ran to several editions, as did subsequent works such as Anna (1863), To Fortællinger (Two Tales, 1866), Småskitser (Short Sketches, 1869) and Livsbilleder (Pictures of Life, 1874). Her fiction depicted both men and women as the principal characters, becoming increasingly religious in tone and conveying her views on the good life. In 1875, after being awarded a travel grant, she spent two years in Sweden and Norway, returning to Denmark with many new ideas. After a pause for several years, she resumed publishing in 1881 with Fra det daglige Liv (From Everyday Life). A long series of new titles followed, culminating with Bodil (1908). Cornelia von Levetzow died on 26 April 1921 in Lyngby where she is buried. References External links *Bibliography of Cornelia v.

It is endemic to the southern Bahamas, specifically to Crooked Island and Acklins. It was originally described as subspecies of Epicrates chrysogaster (now Chilabothrus chrysogaster), but it was elevated to full species status in 2018. In fact, molecular data suggest a closer relationship with Chilabothrus argentum than with Chilabothrus chrysogaster. Etymology The specific name, schwartzi, is in honor of American herpetologist Albert Schwartz.(Epicrates chrysogaster schwartzi, p. 239). Description Chilabothrus schwartzi can reach at least in snout–vent length. There are 1–2 loreal scales (most often one), 8–10 circumorbital scales, and 13 supralabial scales. Ventral scales are immaculate cream- colored. Dorsal coloration is grayish-silver in adults and reddish-orange in juveniles. There are frequently (but not always) elongated saddle blotches of slightly darker color than the dorsal ground color, extending nearly to the ventral scales. Postorbital stripe is absent. Habitat and conservation Specimens have been found actively foraging low (about high) in trees and bushes, and on the ground. As of 2020, Chilabothrus schwartzi has not been included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Its range likely covers two relatively large islands, but it appears to be rare, or at least restricted to specific habitats. Threats to it are unknown, but likely include persecution, roadkills, and introduced vertebrate predators.

The border is 1,468 km (912 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with China in the north to the tripoint with Bangladesh in the south. Description The precise location of the tripoint with China is unclear owing to the Sino-Indian border dispute - at present, the de facto tripoint is located just north of the Diphu Pass. From here the border proceeds to the south-west through the Mishmi Hills, except for an Indian protrusion at the Chaukan Pass, then continuing through the Patkai and Kassom Ranges. At the south-east corner of Manipur it turns sharply westwards along various rivers for a period over to the Tiau River. It then follows this river southwards for a long stretch down to the Chin Hills, before turning west and proceeding to the Bangladeshi tripoint via a series of irregular lines. History Historically the border region has been a contested area located at the edge of the various Indian and Burmese empires. Britain had begun conquering India in the 17th century, and gradually took control of most of the country, forming British India. From the 1820s-80s Britain also gradually conquered Burma; by the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826 which ended the First Anglo-Burmese War Burma recognised British control over Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan), and the Taninthayi coast, thereby delimiting much of the modern boundary in general terms. In 1834 the Kabaw Valley areas was returned to Burma and a modified boundary delimited in this region, dubbed the 'Pemberton line' after a British commissioner, which was later refined in 1881. In 1837 the Patkai Hills were unilaterally designated as the northern boundary. Large swathes of Burma were annexed following the Second Anglo- Burmese War of 1852–53. The remainder of Burma was conquered in 1885 and incorporated into British India. In 1894 a boundary between Manipur and the Chin Hills was delimited, and the existing 'Pemberton line' boundary modified again in 1896. Further boundary modifications were made in 1901, 1921 and 1922. In 1937 Burma was split off from India and became a separate colony.Sword For Pen, TIME Magazine, 12 April 1937 In 1947 India gained independence, however the country was split into two states (India and Pakistan), with the southernmost section of the Burma-India border becoming that between Burma and East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh). Burma gained independence in 1948. On 10 March 1967 Burma and India signed a boundary treaty which delimited their common frontier in detail. Security along the border has often been poor, owing to ongoing conflicts in north-east India and western Myanmar.

Barrier The India–Myanmar barrier is a border barrier that India is constructing to seal its -long border with Myanmar. India hopes to curtail cross-border crime, including goods, arms and counterfeit currency smuggling, drug trafficking, and insurgency. The United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) also warned that the region could become a major transit point for illicit drugs because of the poor state of border security facilities. Indian security forces blamed the porous border for the deaths of 200 security personnel and civilians in militancy-related violence in the region in 2001–2003. Four Northeast Indian states share the border with Myanmar: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Manipur. Both national governments agreed to conduct a joint survey before erecting the fence. The Indian Home Ministry and its Myanmar counterpart completed the survey within six months and in March 2003 began erecting a fence along the border. In 2004, fencing work in the state of Manipur along the border was stalled due to protests raised by the local Kuki and Naga communities. According to them, a huge stretch of land would become Myanmar's territory and foster unrest among people living on both sides of the border. The protests from people living in the Moreh, Chorokhunou, and Molchan areas forced the Home Ministry to refer the matter to the Manipur government. This fence will divide many ethnic communities, including the Mizo, Nagas, Chins, and Kukis whose lands straddle the regions between the two states- it is thus a highly sensitive issue. In 2007 it was reported that in the state of Manipur, a boundary dispute arose with ownership of nine border pillars being disputed. The Indo-Myanmar Border Force (IMBF) is a proposed and soon-to-be- composed force of 29 battalions - 25 battalions from Assam Rifles and 4 battalions from Indo-Tibetan Border Police - to guard the long Indo-Myanmar border. IMBF will remain under ITBP and will patrol the border to the zero line (as of January 2018).Home ministry looks to form 29-battalion Indo- Myanmar border force, Hindustan Times, 18 Jan 2018.

In total, Wright served two years in Newgate and Coldbath Fields prisons, gaining a level of notoriety as the 'She-Champion of Impiety'.  Life  Susannah Godber was born in Nottingham in 1792, and made her living as a lace worker. By 1815, she was living in London, where she married William Wright on 25 December. Before her arrest in July 1821, Wright was already active in radical politics, publishing a number of inflammatory works with her husband, in his name, and associating with a wide circle of radicals. When Richard Carlile, his wife Jane, and subsequently his sister Mary-Ann, were imprisoned for selling blasphemous works from his shop, Susannah Wright took over its management. Arrested and acquitted once, she was prosecuted successfully following her second arrest, and joined the Carliles in Dorchester prison. Wright appeared in court on 8 July 1822, where she conducted her own defence. Despite a lengthy and carefully prepared speech, Wright was ordered to spend (along with her infant child) an initial ten weeks in Newgate jail. Newspapers castigated her as 'wretched and shameless', accusing Wright of having 'shunned all the distinctive shame and fear and decency of her sex'. At sentencing, on 6 February 1823, the Judge ordered Wright to 18 months in Coldbath Fields prison, Clerkenwell. Carlile published a report of Wright's trial from Dorchester Prison, dedicating it: > To the Women of the Island of Great Britain; this Specimen of Female > Patriotism, Love of Liberty, Bold and Honest Daring, to Tyrants and > Hypocrisy, and Virtuous Disinterestedness for All but Virtue, and Human > Amelioration; For their example, consideration, approbation, and > remuneration, is respectfully inscribed by the advocate of their > emancipation from these worst of slaveries, ignorance and idolatry, R. > Carlile. Wright was released from Coldbath Fields in July 1824, having lost the sight in one of her eyes, and with various other ailments. William Wright died eighteen months later. In 1826, Wright established her own radical bookshop in her native Nottingham, 'trading in politically extreme and heretical publications'. Wright also 'made strong demands for educational rights for women and full participation in the cultural benefits society could offer', writing in radical newspaper The Republican.  Legacy  In a biography of her father, Theophila Carlile Campbell described Susannah Wright as a 'plucky little woman' to whom Richard Carlile 'paid... the highest tribute for her enthusiasm, perseverance, coolness, and dauntlessness.' In a letter printed in the work, Carlile wrote that 'there is scarce another woman in England who would have done for me what that woman has done, and from my knowledge of her in 1817-1819, I know that a love of principle has been her ruling motive.' Wright's date of death is unknown.

(11 December 1911), Georges Enesco (8 February 1912), Fritz Kreisler (21 and 28 April 1912), Wilhelm Backhaus (15 May 1912), Claude Debussy (5 May 1917).Claude Debussy, martyrisé par un cancer (in French) resmusica.com 2018  World Wars  During the First World War, the Salle Gaveau was used to give shows to soldiers and victims. However, it continued its original activity. During the interwar period, the hall hosted Charles Munch (28 October 1933), Wanda Landowska (7 November 1933), Rudolf Serkin (2 December 1933), and Yves Nat in 1934. The Lamoureux concerts continued to be held there. The same scenario occurred during the Second World War, when Gaveau was once again used as a gala venue, while hosting famous musicians such as Jacques Février, Pierre Fournier, Samson François, Paul Tortelier, and Raymond Trouard. The concert season continued after the war. In 1955, for example, the hall welcomed Reine Flachot, Pierre Bernac, Francis Poulenc, and Alexandre Lagoya.  Purchase by the Fournier couple  In 1963, Gaveau went bankrupt. This led to the sale of the Gaveau building to an insurance company, and it was destined to be destroyed for the construction of a car park. Chantal and Jean- Marie Fournier, a couple of passionate musicians, bought the hall in 1976.

Subsidies were obtained, and the work was carried out by the chief architect of the Monuments Historiques. The hall reopened on 8 January 2001.

It was painted in the 1620s, and it might be a collaboration between de Momper and Jan Brueghel the Elder Painting The painting is a blend of landscape painting and genre painting. It shows a scene of rural life typical of Flanders. The people are spreading cloth on a bleachfield, an open area used for spreading woven fabrics on the ground, in order to purify and whiten them by the action of the sunlight. Bleachfields were also common in northern England, whereto the Flemings migrated in large numbers throughout the medieval and early modern periods; for instance, the name of the town of Whitefield, on the outskirts of Manchester, is thought to derive from the medieval bleachfields used by Flemish settlers. To the left, the painting depicts a bustling town market. There is a pleasant contrast between the animated, hectic market and the placid bleachfield; as well as between the former and the elevated sky. The painting is currently housed at the Museum of Prado, in Madrid. It was part of the Royal Collection since at least the early 18th century, when it was housed at the Zarzuela Palace.

He was known for several newspaper comic strips in the 1930s and 1950s, including Dumb Dora and Sandy Hill, as well as a series of humorous books of Southern slang published in the 1970s. Early life Dwyer was born in Ohio on January 29, 1907. The family lived in the Ohio towns of Portsmouth, Perrysburg and Paint when he was young. Dwyer attended Ohio State University around 1925, where he befriended fellow cartoonist Milton Caniff. Around this time, the two worked together at the Columbus Dispatch newspaper. Dwyer left Ohio State after only a few months to enroll in the Yale School of Art, in part to be closer to the New York publishing world. Dwyer sold gag cartoons to publications such as the New Yorker, College Humor and Collier's. He eventually dropped out of Yale also when his cartooning career began to take off. Career =Comic strips= He was hired at King Features Syndicate to be part of its artists' bullpen, and in 1932 was named to take over the comic strip Dumb Dora, the third to handle the strip after its creator Chic Young (who moved on to create the more successful strip Blondie) and Paul Fung. Dwyer's cartooning experience at the time was limited to single-panel cartoons; he had never worked on a daily cartoon strip. He hired Milton Caniff to help him by ghost-writing and drawing a number of strips, working closely with Dwyer for the first year and a half of Dwyer's tenure on the strip. Comics historian Don Markstein was dismissive about Dwyer's era on the strip, and called his later works Sandy Hill and Mr. Dilly \\"even more minor.\\" Writing in the 1983 book The World Encyclopedia of Comics, Maurice Horn wrote more charitably that Dwyer \\"drew a fresh, witty, well-scripted strip,\\" but felt that the central concept of Dumb Dora had grown obsolete by the time Dwyer took over, saying that \\"the day of the flapper had gone with the 1920s, and the strip died in the middle 1930s.\\" Allan Holtz, author of American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide, felt that Dwyer continued the earlier eras of the strip \\"quite capably\\" and said that Dwyer's \\"style was a little looser, but still maintained a good thread all the way back to Young.\\" Caniff himself took credit only for some of the art and none of the writing, calling Dwyer \\"a good gag man.\\" Dumb Dora was canceled in 1936. Also in the early 1930s, Dwyer worked on the strips Bing Brown and When Mother Was a Girl. When Mother Was a Girl, also created by Chic Young, was a \\"topper\\" to Dumb Dora that was laid out above the main strip in the comics pages. It was canceled simultaneously with Dora. Mr. Dilly began and ended in 1948. His final strip, Sandy Hill, about a boy and his family living in the country, was distributed by the Register and Tribune Syndicate from 1951 to 1954. More than 300 of Dwyer's cartoons and sketches are archived in the Special Collections Research Center at Syracuse University. Others are housed in the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University. =Merry Mountaineers= Dwyer's life and career in the 1940s to 1960s is not well documented by available sources. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943 during World War II. He may also have been a ghostwriter for Wally Bishop's comic strip Muggs and Skeeter while Bishop was serving in World War II. A 1975 article in the Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal claims that he worked for Walt Disney in the 1940s as unit production director on Bambi and Fantasia. At some point he moved with his wife to the small town of Horse Shoe, North Carolina to become a cattle and hog farmer, while also teaching art via correspondence and trying to market a series of his own inventions including a plastic artists' palette and various kitchen appliances. He then moved to the larger nearby town of Highlands and founded a publishing company, Merry Mountaineers, writing, illustrating and publishing a series of humorous books and pamphlets about Southern language such as Dictionary For Yankees and Other Uneducated People, Cookin' Yankees Ain't Et, and How Tuh Live in the Kooky South Without Eatin' Grits: A Fun Guide Book Fer Yankees. Dwyer's books, often co-written with his wife, were popular in the Appalachian and Southern regions of the United States. Death Dwyer died on December 13, 1987, in Highlands, North Carolina.

Promoted by the singles \\"Sorry Bro (I Love You)\\", \\"Give Great Thanks\\", \\"Edgelord\\", and the dual-singles \\"Gentleman\\" and \\"M'Lady\\", the full project was revealed On September 21, 2020. The album features appearances from Rebecca Black, Faris Badwan, Pussy Riot, Village People, The Garden, Dylan Brady, and Clarence Clarity among others. Background and composition The album was conceived mostly during two writing sessions with Count Baldor and Dylan Brady, one in Las Vegas and another in a castle in Barnstaple. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Electra recorded most of the vocals in a home studio. My Agenda is a hyperpop and experimental pop record that features elements of heavy metal, glitch pop, techno, baroque pop, trance, bubblegum bass, happy hardcore, gregorian chant, dubstep, deconstructed club, trap, hardstyle, shock rock, europop, and viking metal. The album is described as exploring \\"crisis in masculinity\\" and \\"[tackles] topics such as incel culture, the politicization of athletics, culture wars and more\\" \\"through a queer lens\\". The title of My Agenda is a reference to the \\"gay agenda\\" and the title song is written \\"from the perspective of a conspiracy theorist who is watching their country being taken over by a gay dictator\\". Reception Joe Vitagliano of American Songwriter praised My Agenda, giving the project five stars. Commenting on the record's ability to blend political themes, musical experimentation, and pop hooks, he noted that \\"Electra’s writing constitutes some of the finest political art of our times. By analyzing these themes through a lens of well-informed critique, Electra is able to present nuanced looks on the realities of our culture while also retaining a sense of genuine fun. For example, the project’s lead single, “Sorry Bro (I Love You),” plays with themes of sexuality and gender in a normalizing way that presents homoeroticism as something safe, cute and fun, as opposed to shameful.\\" Track listing Credits adapted from Tidal.

She was the first feminist journalist of the country. An Afro-Dominican, she also founded the first secular coeducational school in the Dominican Republic, as well as the first women's library, first women's normal school and first women's pharmacy training courses. There are several schools in the country which have been named after her. Early life María del Socorro Sánchez del Rosario was born on 15 August 1830 on the island of Hispaniola, in Santo Domingo, which at the time was part of the Republic of Haiti, to María Olaya del Rosario de Belén and Narciso Sánchez Ramona. Her father descended of slaves and her mother was a free woman of color, descended of European and African ancestors. Her father's sister María Trinidad Sánchez, was executed for her participation as a freedom fighter in the Dominican War of Independence. Her mother was a hairdresser and made combs, while her father worked in the meat trade, selling, butchering and raising cattle. Sánchez was one of eleven siblings: Francisco (1817–1861); Tomás (1819–1878), Eugenio (1822–1889); Manuel de Jesús (1823–?); María de la Cruz (1824–?); Juan Francisco (1826–1845); Jacinto (1827–1900); Pablo Marcial (1829–?); Ana (1832–?); and Idelfonso (1834–1897). Francisco is recognized as one of the co- founding fathers of the Dominican Republic. Career Sánchez was raised in a nationalist family which was critical of the Haitian regime which ruled the country from 1822 to 1844 and the Spanish annexation of the country which lasted from 1861 to 1865. She was strongly influenced by her aunt Trinidad and her commitment to the independence of the Dominican Republic. Another influence was Madame Roland a writer and leading figure of the French Revolution. Sánchez began writing and publishing her views, both openly and using the pseudonym Rosa Cruz. As the first feminist journalist in the country, she publicly exposed the corruption of the authorities, and was described as behaving like a man for her outspokenness. In addition to her nationalist position, Sánchez wrote articles advocating for women's education and employment. She wrote for various newspapers, including El Dominicano, El Telégrafo, and El Telegrama, all major publications in the country. After her brother Francisco's execution for opposing President Pedro Santana's invitation for Spain to recolonize the country, Sánchez was exiled to St. Thomas at the time part of the Danish West Indies, but for which Spain had tendered an offer to acquire. After her return in 1863 to Santo Domingo, she spent a year in jail for expressing her anti-government sentiments. Among the issues deemed objectionable by the authorities were her statements advocating for Dominican sovereignty, free speech, and women's education. Sánchez began her career as a teacher, providing instruction in Cibao and Santo Domingo. By 1870, Sánchez was living in Santiago de los Caballeros and that year established the first co-educational and secular school, Colegio Sagrado Corazón de María (Sacred Heart of Maria College), in the country. Her students, from the upper-class of the city, paid tuition, but she waived the fees for those who were unable to pay. Among the women who graduated from this school were Eugenia Dechamps, Matilde Grullón, Rita Infante, Clementina Jiménez, Altagracia Perelló, and Justina Perelló. A member of the 27 February Women's Club, she took active part in literary salons and established the first women's library in the country located at 50 Calle Sol, in 1876, in Santiago. Moving back to the capital, in 1881, Sánchez founded the Colegio La Altagracia (High Grace College) in Santo Domingo, which would become the Escuela Superior de Señoritas (Superior School for Ladies) and graduated the first female secondary students in the country. The following year, she created a curricula for women to train as pharmacists at the school. The first licensed school teacher in the country Dolores Rodríguez de Objío (1883) and the first women pharmacists (1887) in the country graduated from this school. Death and legacy Sánchez died on 26 March 1899 in Santo Domingo. Her obituary published in Listín Diario was not flattering, calling her \\"manly\\" and adding that Sánchez was known for \\"su apostolado en la enseñanza pública, en la agitada intromisión de sus energías en la vida política del país y en el audaz empeño que puso siempre por distinguirse entre sus conciudadanos\\" [her ministry in public education, in the agitated meddling of her energies in the political life of the country, and in the bold effort she always put into distinguishing herself from her fellow citizens]. She was initially buried in the Capilla de los Inmortales (Chapel of the Immortals) in the Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor, but her remains were relocated in 1974 to the Panteón Nacional (National Pantheon). For many years, her legacy was lost, not only because of her relationship with revolutionary figures whose memories were repressed by later regimes, but because she was a black woman. Ángela Peña, a journalist at Hoy wrote in 2009 that because Sánchez was a negra retinta, (an unmistakably black woman), historians and the media tried to credit Salomé Ureña as the first woman journalist and educator. A street in the Gascue neighborhood of Santo Domingo that was named in her honor had been renamed by the 1920s. In 2002, the Escuela Básica Socorro Sánchez (Socorro Sánchez Primary School) began operating in a rented facility in Los Alcarrizos. In 2016, a new facility for the institution was opened. In 2015, a school with the same name was established in Villa Altagracia.

About  The 72 acre farm is located in Grafton, NY and was purchased by Leah Penniman and Jonah Vitale-Wolff in 2006. The farm was officially open in 2010. The name is taken from the song Soulfire by Lee “Scratch” Perry and began as a farm share for low-income people. As Soul Fire Farm has grown, its mission is to end racism and injustice in the food system and by reclaiming the inherent right to belong to the earth and to have agency in the food system as Black and Brown people. Food is intensively cultivated using exclusively organic and ancestral techniques that increase topsoil depth, sequester carbon, and increase soil biodiversity. To help capture carbon, the farm grows mostly perennials and practice silvopasture where livestock grazes in orchards to mitigate the effects of climate change. The buildings on the farm are hand-constructed, using local wood, adobe, straw bales, solar heat, and reclaimed materials. The goals of the farm are to end racism and injustice in the food system. The team of workers and activists there also bring diverse communities together on the land to share skills on sustainable agriculture, natural building, spiritual activism, health and environmental justice through their programs. The farm's flagship program is the Black Latinx Farmers Immersion, a 50-hour course to train beginner farmers. By 2018, 500 individuals had taken the course. In 2020, the farm made plans to expand and began raising money due to its infrastructure being designed for a single family yet hosting 3,000 visitors per year.  Programs  Soul Fire Farm Share (Community Supported Agriculture) The program delivers freshly grown produce each week, to the doorsteps of over 80 farm share members in Troy and Albany New York, based on the spirit of ujaama, or cooperative economics. Payment can be made according to an income based sliding-scale, EBT payments are accepted, and no one is turned away for lack of income. This program also provides #solidarityshares, for immigrants, refugees, and those impacted by state violence. ”We are committed to working with the most marginalized issues. It's a different economic model. It's about relationships. It's not just a model of selling,\\" says Penniman.  Black and Latinx Farmers Immersion  This program teaches novice and intermediate growers the basic skills of regenerative farming and has trained over 350 farmers since 2011. The training covers skills like planting, transplanting, harvesting, compost, pest management, processing chickens, and use of medicinal herbs. The program supplies the tools for additional comprehensive commercial farm training. Participants learn in a culturally relevant and supportive environment that helps them connect to the land and understand \\"trauma rooted in oppression on land.”  Uprooting Racism Immersion  This workshop provides farming and food justice leaders with theory and action. Participants examine the history of food injustice and then devise strategies to end the systemic racism in the food system.  Youth Program  The goal of this program is to reconnect youth to their innate belonging to the land and to restore each person's rightful place of empowerment in the food system. It exposes young people to harvesting, cooking and food justice knowledge through one day workshops, including inter-generational groups. From 2013-2015, the farm’s restorative justice program allowed teens to earn money to pay off court-ordered restitution and avoid incarceration. Soul Fire Farm’s youth program began in 2011.  Activist Retreats  “From prisoner justice to climate justice, our struggles for a world of dignity, empowerment, and sustainability are intertwined. Those of us on the front lines of social and environmental change understand the need to periodically step out of our everyday context to rejuvenate, strategize, and connect.” Soul Fire Farm makes their space available to activists working for social and environmental change so that they might \\"rejuvenate, strategize, and connect.” Community Farm Days Each Month, from April to October, Soul Fire Farm hosts community farm days, where volunteers and staff work the land and learn together, followed by a potluck and conversation. The farm honors the Haitian cultural practice of Konbit, cooperative work and mutual aid.  Partner Projects  Soul Fire Farm is a partner with the Victory Bus Project which was created to assist the family members of incarcerated people with the cost of visiting loved ones because state funding for busing families was eliminated. Instead of purchasing an actual ticket for the bus fare to the prison for a visit, the family can instead pay for a box of Soul Fire Farm produce with SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. They receive the benefit of visiting loved ones and receiving fresh produce. Soul Fire Farm also partners with The Northeast Farmers of Color Network on the Reparations Map for Black-Indigenous Farmers. The aim is to claim sovereignty of the food system that was built on the stolen land and stolen labor of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian and people of color and calls for reparations of land and resources.

History The street lay immediately outside the walls of Roman Eboracum, and it may well be of Roman origin. It was first recorded in about 1200, taking its name from its church, St Andrew, St Andrewgate. At this date, part of the street may also have been known as \\"Ketmangergate\\", distinguished by an early stone house. In the Mediaeval period, it was sometimes called \\"Great St Andrewgate\\", to distinguish it from the Little St Andrewgate running around the church, now part of Spen Lane. There was a religious hospital on the street, although its exact location is not known. In the Georgian period, numerous large merchant's houses were built on the street. The York City Commission lay on the street, and in 1821, the city's first police station was established in its building. In 1830, the entrance to the street from King's Square was widened, while in 1850, the street of Bedern was extended to reach St Andrewgate. In 1873, the Bedern National School opened on the corner of St Andrewgate and Bedern, operating until 1940. While many of the street's 17th- and 18th-century buildings survived World War II, most were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s and have been replaced with modern housing. Layout and architecture The street runs north-east from King's Square to Aldwark. Bartle Garth and Bedern lead off its north-west side, as does the modern Granary Court, while Spen Lane and the modern St Andrew Place lead off the south-east side. Notable buildings on the street include St Andrew's Church; the side of the Colliergate drill hall; 20 St Andrewgate, built in 1781 by Thomas Atkinson, as his own house; 42 St Andrewgate, built about 1740; 44 St Andrewgate, built as a fire station; and early 19th-century houses at 46, 48 and 50 St Andrewgate.

Ianos developed from an area of low pressure over the Gulf of Sidra that quickly began tropical cyclogenesis while moving over warm waters. After receiving various names from different meteorological centers, the storm, dubbed Ianos by the Greeks, rapidly intensified while moving northeast. After scraping Italy, the storm went on to hit Malta and Crete with tropical storm- force winds. Despite land interaction, the small cyclone reached its peak intensity of on 18 September, immediately before making landfall in southwestern Greece. After landfall, Ianos turned back out to sea and moved south-southeastward, before dissipating on 21 September. Damage was severe in Greece, with cities in the central part of the country getting the brunt of the storm's impacts. Cities such as Karditsa and Mouzaki were flooded for several days. Heavy agricultural damage was reported in rural areas north of Athens. A state of emergency was declared for the islands of Ithaca, Kefalonia, and Zakynthos. Four people were killed, and one person remains missing. Ianos caused at least $100 million (2020 USD) in damages. Meteorological history An upper-level low moved eastward in the southern Mediterranean Sea through September 14. On that day, a low-pressure area began to develop over the Gulf of Sidra, beginning tropical cyclogenesis by forming a warm core at the surface. The cyclone quickly developed in the subsequent hours while slowly moving northwest with a wind speed of around . By 15 September, it had intensified to , with a minimum pressure of , with further development predicted over the coming days. The cyclone had strong potential to become tropical over the next several days due to warm sea temperatures of in the region. Weather models predicted that it would likely hit the west coast of Greece on 17 or 18 September. Ianos gradually intensified over the Mediterranean Sea, acquiring an eye-like feature. Ianos made landfall on Greece at peak intensity on 03:00 UTC on September 18, with winds peaking near and a minimum central pressure estimated at , equivalent to a minimal Category 1 hurricane. After making landfall, Ianos turned south-southeastward on 19 September, moving back out to sea, where the storm managed to reorganize somewhat. Soon afterward, Ianos underwent a weakening trend. Ianos continued moving south-southeastward for another couple of days before dissipating on 21 September, off the coast of Cyrenaica. Warmer sea surface temperatures caused by climate change in the Mediterranean Sea can allow the storms to take on more tropical appearances and characteristics, increasing the wind speeds and making the storms more intense. A 2017 study in Global and Planetary Change led by Raquel Romera that examined a large suite of regional climate model projections supported the theory that medicanes will gradually become stronger due to climate change. Preparations and impact Subtropical Storm Alpha (left) and Medicane Ianos (right) both affecting Europe on 18 September. As Ianos passed to the south of Italy on 16 September, it produced heavy rain across the southern part of the country and in Sicily. As much as of rain was reported in Reggio Calabria, more than the city's normal monthly rainfall. The Hellenic National Meteorological Service issued Red Alerts, the highest level of warnings, to alert people of the storm while it was approaching Greece. Downed trees and power outages were reported on Kefalonia, and residents were urged to stay indoors. Wind gusts reached on Kefalonia and Zakynthos. When Ianos stalled over the western part of Greece, it caused flash flooding and landslides. The peak official rainfall amount recorded was , though the exact peak rainfall amount is claimed to be much higher than that. Ianos left four people dead and one missing. On 19 September, a man was found dead on his farm north of Athens, while the body of a woman was recovered from her flooded home in a nearby town. On 20 September, the body of a 62-year-old farmer was found under the collapsed roof of his house in a village north of Athens. In addition, a 43-year-old woman was found dead on 24 September after being declared missing on 20 September. The woman was swept several kilometres from her car by flash flooding. More than 5,000 homes were damaged. In addition, there were strong tides in Ionian islands such as Kefalonia, Zakynthos, Ithaca and Lefkada, and winds at Karditsa that brought down trees and power lines, and caused landslides. A bridge also collapsed in Karditsa, one of the hardest-hit areas. Throughout the country, over 600 people were rescued by the national firefighting service. Greece's cotton crop was ready for harvest, which was set to begin just as the storm hit. However, Ianos likely caused significant flooding and crop losses where rain was heaviest, especially in Thessalia. Assos, in Kefalonia, was isolated from the rest of the island and the mainland. Nearly two metres (6.5 feet) of rubble covered roads, prohibiting access by car and trapping residents and tourists. Damage in Kefalonia totalled more than €50,000 ($58,555 USD). Aftermath and naming On 20 September, the Public Power Corporation said that 61 power substations were in operation in the urban zone of Karditsa, and another 10 will be powered shortly. Efforts are made to restore power in Argithea and Mouzaki. The top officials of the corporation met with the leader of the Karditsa Fire Department to coordinate and accelerate water pumping in areas where the technical crews need to work. Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis pledged that \\"all the affected areas will have immediate support.\\" He sent three senior officials to the worst-hit central region. On 22 September, Prime Minister Mitsotakis visited the Karditsa region, one of the hardest-hit regions. 5,000 to 8,000 euros were given to each household and business in Karditsa and Mouzaki. In Mouzaki, Mayor Fanis Stathis declared that all schools and nurseries will remain closed, as Ianos damaged the road network, and school buildings of the region. Greece assigned the system the name \\"Ianos\\" (), sometimes anglicized to \\"Janus\\", while the German weather service used the name \\"Udine\\"; the Turkish used \\"Tulpar\\", and the Italians \\"Cassilda\\".

As their name suggests, they are essentially located in northern Italy, however, they are also partly located in southern Switzerland. They are all glacial lakes that formed after the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age. The group is composed of (from west to east): Lake Orta, Lake Maggiore, Lake Varese, Lake Lugano, Lake Como, Lake Iseo, Lake Idro and Lake Garda.Gabriel Faure (1923). The Italian Lakes: Maggiore, Como, Orta, Varese, Lugano, Iseo, Garda The three largest are all well over 100 km2, they are: Lake Garda (largest in Italy), Lake Maggiore (largest in southern Switzerland) and Lake Como. The lakes are located in the Italian regions of Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, and in the Swiss canton of Ticino. They are all located at least partly in Italy, while two of them (Maggiore and Lugano) are partly in Switzerland. The Italian Lakes constitute a popular tourist destination since the Roman Era for their mild climate and their view over the Alps.Italian Lakes, The Telegraph Climate At latitudes between 45° and 46° North and at elevations below 400 metres above sea level, the Italian Lakes enjoy a lot of sunshine and a very mild weather. The region is known for its sub- Mediterranean climate, making it the warmest area of Switzerland and significantly warmer than most regions of northern Italy. There sub-tropical plants can grow all the year round in the numerous gardens, notably those of the Borromean and Brissago Islands. During winter, the lakes help to maintain a higher temperature in the surrounding regions (since water releases heat energy more slowly than air) with snowfalls being erratic and primarily affecting the higher elevations around the lakes. Rainfall is lowest during the winter months and heaviest around summer, peaking in spring and autumn.See for instance Locarno#Climate, Lugano#Climate or Como#ClimateThe history of Lake Maggiore lagomaggioreonline.it.

Little is known about her origins or early life, but she is known for the substantial charitable donations for women's causes. In particular, she founded the first hospital in Malta dedicated exclusively to women.  Early life  Originally from Siena, Italy, from where she got her nickname \\"La Senese\\", Scappi spent a lot of her life in Malta. Scappi was an active businesswoman, from which she may have acquired some of her fortune. Her birth place, year of birth, and filiation are unknown, and she never mentions them in any of the notorial contracts or wills she wrote. The first mention of Caterina Scappi in Malta comes from a criminal court record from 1583-4, in which Scappi testifies in a robbery case.  Charitable donations and the founding of the hospital  Scappi was considerably wealthy, but did not live a life of luxury, rather donating a lot of her money to charitable causes. She is known to have donated money to the convent of the Repentite in 1597; this was a religious institute whose mission was to help prostitutes. At the time, she specified that should she later choose to join the convent, this payment should be considered a down-payment. Coat of arms of Santa Maria della Scala Though hospitals existed for the knights, women in need of care had no where to go. Scappi is thought to have treated women in her private home, but 1625, using her resources, she endowed the ospedaletto, also known as La Casetta, the first hospital dedicated exclusively to women. In her will, she describes her motivations for founding the hospital: \\"As inspired by the Lord, eager to help and cure those wretched women who have fallen ill and who, bereft of everything, cannot receive treatment in their homes, driven by mercy for their misery.\\" For this, and her many contributions to helping women, Giovanni Bonello who researched her life in a series of articles for the Times of Malta, calls her \\"the very first feminist in the history of a male-dominant Malta.\\" The hospital started in a house called Santa Maria della Scala, after a renowned hospital in Sienna. This hospital's coat of arms was engraved on Scappi's tombstone. Later, the hospital relocated, and was officially named Santa Maria della Pietà. The hospital was subsidised by the Order of St John in 1631. In his book History of Gynaecology in Malta, Charles Savona-Ventura explains that \\"The advent of the Knights of St John in 1530 and the establishment of the Island as a maritime base brought prostitution to the Islands creating an ideal environment for the spread of venereal disease.\\" In fact, Malta's high venereal disease infection rate had earned the island a grim reputation. In 1979, an anonymous author wrote: \\"There is no place in the whole world where venereal disease attacks faster and spreads easier than in Malta, for here it is a compound of all the poxes in the world.\\" * cited in: * Scappi's hospital came to be known as the \\"spedale delle donne incurabili\\", the hospital for incurable women. This is because many of the women who came to be treated were prostitutes with venereal diseases, which were incurable at the time. They were usually treated with mercury, and some patients died of mercury poisoning.  Legacy  In the last will she drafted, in 1643, she chose two knights from Sienna, Fra Ottavio Bardinelli and Fra Giulio Cesare, as her testamentary executors, and protectors of the ospedaletto. Upon their death, she asked that they be replaced by two more knights from Siena. She also specified that should something happen to the Santa Maria della Pietà house, her fortune should be used to buy another house to serve as a women's hospital. After Scappi's death, the Ordinary Council of the Order of St John closed down the hospital, but without it, there was no way of preventing the spread of venereal disease or treating it, so the hospital was reopened in 1959. The hospital was renovated to increase the number of beds, reaching 230 beds by 1786. It began accepting mentally ill patients, as well as maternity cases, and eventually children. The hospital was later destroyed during a war. Her will contains further donations: Scappi established free refuges for women, and donated furniture, money, clothes, and dowries. Scappi owned a slave, Giuliana, whom she freed upon her death. Scappi left further legacies to many women, including Caterina Doneo, the daughter of the painter Francesco Doneo, and Lucrezia Montano, the daughter of the lawyer Palermino Montano. There is no record of Scappi being married, nor that she had any biological children. However, in 1632 she adopted a six year-old girl named Maria, whom she looked after for 14 years. Casa Scappi, in Valletta She was buried in the church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Valletta. She was initially buried in a corner of a chapel, but in 1791 her body was exhumed in order to be reburied in a more prominent area of the church. There is speculation that this reburial was evidence of a power play for the Scappi foundation. When the church was pulled down in 1958, both her tombstone and that of Caterina Vitale were kept and put on display in the new church. Casa Scappi, the house where she likely lived, at 74 Old Bakery Street in Valletta, housed the Johann Strauss School of Music. In the book Awguri Giovanni Bonello!, Clare Azzopardi wrote a fictonal piece about Caterina Scappi, from the perspectives of women who knew her.

Felix himself graduated licentiate of both laws on 26 August 1744. After he had served as a canon of the chapter of St. Peter's Church, Leuven, on 16 January 1751 he was appointed dean of the chapter of St Gummarus Church in Lier and on 26 January 1758 ecclesiastical councillor on the Great Council of Mechelen.Ferdinand Vande Putte, \\"Brenart (Felix-Guillaume-Antoine)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 2 (Brussels, 1868), 939–941.

He made his solemn entry into his see on 3 August. For the occasion, the Capuchins of Bruges published a collection of congratulatory verses, acrostics and chronograms.Applausus metricus, chrono- metro, ac metro-achrosticè congratulatorius (Bruges, 1777).

Brenart was a vigorous opponent of these changes, and welcomed the Brabant Revolution of 1790. During the Flanders campaign of the early French Revolutionary Wars he became a refugee first in Brabant, then in Guelders and finally in Westphalia. He died at Anholt, in Westphalia, on 26 October 1794, and was buried three days later in the crypt of the parish church there.

Background  The Algerian War after the Toussaint Rouge terror attacks, was centered around the Aurès (and to a lesser extent the Kabylia, and Constantine) mountains, because of a lack of FLN influence in other parts of the country. Knowing this, the French administration launched multiple operations into the mountains, in hopes halting the FLN's fledgling rebellion.  The Battle  The Operation, which was one of the first ones in the Algerian war, encompassed the region of the Ahmar Khaddou mountain in the Aurès. The Operation was developed by the chief of staff of the army, André Zeller. The goal of the Operation was to isolate the ALN combatants from the population who, deprived of supplies by closures, controls and rationing, would no longer provide logistical support to these combatants. The effect of this operation will be insignificant, as the military and civil authorities of the region were almost completely ignorant of the social structures of the inhabitants of the Aures and especially the relations established between them and the men of the insurrection who, since long before. November 1, 1954, were already living in the mountains. On the military level and according to the French press, only nine combatants were killed on the Algerian side. This result clearly showed the ineffectiveness of the means implemented in the face of the ALN. In the first few days of the operation, caves, and other places where Fellaghas would hide, were bombed by the Air Force, but to no avail. During the operations, Napalm bombs were also utilized by the Air Force. The Algerian response, which was organized by Mostefa Ben Boulaid was mostly irregular hit and run attacks, which were rather successful, even though the FLN forces in the region were severely underequipped. Towards the end of the operation the French army also started utilizing artillery pieces, to bombard suspected rebel positions. Following the capture of Ben Boulaid, the leader of Wilaya I became Bachir Chihani, who commanded the local forces for the last few days of the operation. Albeit the large amount of manpower and money the French state poured into it, Operation Véronique was a large failure, only causing the death of 9 Algerian militants, and failing to pacify to Ahmar Khaddou mountain.  Aftermath  The French failure to destroy the roots of the Algerian rebellion, caused FLN influence to rapidly grow over the country. By the next months, some rural parts of the Aurés mountains were already controlled by the FLN.

It is named after the numerous cave bear skeletons found there, that likely inhabited the site 20,000 years ago. With 80,000 visitors annually, it is the most visited show cave in Swabian Jura. Bear's Cave was formed in limestone of the White Jurassic, and provided shelter for various types of prehistoric animals. The caves have also been home to a theme park, Dreamland, since 1974. The cave is made up of two parts, the Karlshöhle, discovered in 1834, and the Bärenhöhle, discovered in 1949. The first part of the cave was initially vandalised and pillaged by visitors upon its discovery, and was only reopened to the public upon the discovery of the second cave.  History  The Fauthsloch The cave system was developed over a period of about five million years. Fossils show that 20,000 years ago, bears, rhinoceroses and German cave lions roamed the area, and full reconstructions of the bear's skeletons can be viewed on the site today. 8,000 years ago, it was inhabited by humans. The stalactites in the cave were formed in White Jura. Since April 2013, the site has been one of the 26 information points of UNESCO Global Geoparks, Swabian Jura. = Discovery of Karlshöhle = In 1834, a local teacher known mononymously as \\"Fauth\\" accidentally discovered this part of the cave. While collecting herbs, he dropped his Tabaksdose (tobacco packet) into a crevice, which he found he could widen and climb down. The next day, him and his friends opened up the cave to tourists, who raided it for souvenirs, or vandalised its geology. Today, the entrance Fauth found is named \\"Fauthloch\\" in his honour. = Discovery of Bärenhöhle = In 1949, Karl Bez, a recreational cave explorer saw a bat disappear through a crack. He climbed through and found 30 bear skeletons in this undiscovered part of the caves.  Dreamland  The bear-themed park Dreamland (German: Traumland) has been operating in Bear's cave since 1974.

As on Alcor's earlier Duo-4 and Duo-6, its inline engines were mounted horizontally to minimize their separation and drag. Only one was built; it was lost in a crash less than four months after its first flight. Design and development The C-6-1 was a low wing airliner of mixed wood and metal construction. Its wings were tapered in plan, ending in semi-elliptical tips, and were built around twin spars. Its ribs were steel tube girder structures in inner, high stress regions around engine and undercarriage attachment points but were spruce girders elsewhere. Wing covering was largely plywood, except close to fuel tanks where duralumin was used. The trailing edges carried hydraulically operated flaps and Frise ailerons. Though in the high wing Duo-4 and -6 the engines were mounted on the sides of the forward fuselage, the low wing of the C-6-1 enabled their attachment, cylinder heads together, to the forward wing spars, with steel trusses distributing loads to the rear spars. Their cowlings formed a local, inner extension of the leading edges. The engines were , air-cooled, supercharged, straight-six Menasco C-6S Super-Buccaneers. Their positioning brought the propeller tips to within . The forward fuselage, which included the engine and wing mountings, had a steel tube frame and was skinned with light alloy. Behind the cockpit the fuselage became a semi-monocoque wooden structure, with spruce frames and longerons under pressure-formed two-ply shell. The cockpit had seating for two with dual controls and the passenger cabin behind had three rows of seats in pairs either side of a central aisle. At the rear of the cabin there was a toilet and a baggage compartment with a radio cabin behind it. The C-6-1 had a conventional cantilever tail formed from plywood over wood frames. The horizontal tail, mounted on the top of the fuselage, was narrow and straight-edged but the vertical tail was much broader and curved, its dorsal fin rising slowly from the fuselage. Control surfaces were balanced and fitted with trim tabs. Its main landing gear was retractable, with oleo legs retracting rearwards and rotating axially through 90° so the wheels, equipped with brakes, lay flat in the wings. The faired, oleo-legged tailwheel did not retract but lockably swivelled for ground manoeuvres. The first flight of the C-6-1 was made on March 6, 1938 and a brief development program showed good handling. However, during a test flight on June 27, 1938 the pilot initiated a high speed dive, not part of the flight program, from which he could not recover. The two crew escaped by parachute over San Francisco Bay, but the financial consequences ended Alcor Aircraft.

In 2014, Toney was appointed as a Regional Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the Southeast region by President Barack Obama. Prior to this, Toney served as the first woman and African American to serve as Mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, a position she held from 2004 to 2011.  Early life and education  Toney was born to Victor McTeer, a civil rights attorney, and Mercidees McTeer, a public school teacher, in Greenville, Mississippi, where she was raised. Victor McTeer was one of the first African Americans to attend Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College) and, after graduating from Rutgers Law School in 1972 (I think this is wrong - I see she was 27 when she was elected mayor in 2004. She would have been -5 years old at graduation), returned to his home state of Mississippi to practice law. After high school, Toney attended Spelman College, where she was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, receiving a bachelor's degree in sociology. Following the completion of her undergraduate education, Toney attended Tulane University Law School, where she received her Juris Doctorate. During her legal career, she primarily handled employment discrimination and medical malpractice cases.  Mayoralty of Greenville  In 2004, Toney became the first woman, first African American, and youngest person to serve as Mayor of Greenville. Located in the Mississippi Delta, the poverty rate of Greenville is almost three times the national average. During her tenure as mayor, she was credited with helping the city resolve its debt crisis. Toney is a past president of the National Conference of Black Mayors. As mayor, she prioritized environmental issues, specifically with regards to protecting the local water supply.  EPA career  In 2009, Toney was nominated by EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson to serve as chairwoman of the EPA's Local Government Advisory Committee. Jackson was impressed by Toney's work combatting water pollution in Greenville. In 2014, Toney was nominated by President Obama to serve as Regional EPA Administrator for Region 4, consisting of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and six tribal nations. Region 4 has been referred to as a \\"historically troubled\\" region plagued by \\"energy apartheid\\", and the resignation of former Regional Administrator Gwen Keyes Fleming led to a long vacancy in the position prior to Toney's appointment. Toney has been mentioned as a potential future EPA Administrator.  Environmental justice work  Since leaving the EPA in 2017, Toney has involved herself in environmental justice organizing. Toney is currently the National Field Director for Moms Clean Air Force, which focuses on combatting air pollution. In 2019, Toney penned an op-ed for The New York Times where she argued that the need to combat climate change and protect the environment is a racial justice issue. Toney Toney has criticized the mainstream environmental movement for ignoring the concerns of communities of color.  Personal life  Toney is married to Dexter Toney and has three children.

It was developed to compare the viewpoints of judges in the US Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. It is one of the most commonly used measures of judicial ideology.  History  The Judicial Common Space was developed by Lee Epstein, Andrew D. Martin, Jeffrey A. Segal, and Chad Westerland. It developed over a series of conferences and publications from 2005 through 2007, and was based on the NOMINATE Common Space score. NOMINATE was developed in 1997 to compare the political ideologies of members of Congress and Presidents. It also integrated Martin-Quinn scores, developed in 2002 to provide a voting-based ideological comparison of Supreme Court justices.  Method  The Judicial Common Space is based on the finding that a judge's rulings are often similar in ideology to the person who appointed the judge. The JCS factors in the ideology scores of the president, as well as both senators from the judge's home state. If both senators are in the president's party, their scores are averaged. If both senators are from another party, then neither senator's score is used. The judge is placed on a spectrum of liberal and conservative. A score of \\"0\\" indicates no ideological leaning towards either philosophy. A score of -1 is the most liberal ideology, while a score of 1 is the most conservative.  Accuracy  Andrew D. Martin, one of the creators of the JCS as well as the Martin-Quinn score, says that the JCS of circuit court judges is highly correlated to their Martin-Quinn scores after a year on the Supreme Court. This indicates that the JCS is an accurate predictor of ideology.

It was painted in the early 1620s, and is currently housed at the Museum of Prado in Madrid. Painting De Momper produced paintings that contained and highlighted both landscape and ordinary people engaged in common activities to varying degrees. He had some stock models which he repeated throughout his oeuvre. Such models were popular among the Flemings at the time. One of them entailed the depiction of a large landscape with some reduced figures in the foreground, carrying out everyday activities. In this painting, de Momper portrayed hunters, beggars and riders. In the background, there is an extensive view of the mountains melding into the ocean, with a breathtaking view of a gulf. The painting shows the imaginative work of the Flemish artist. Flanders is a quite flat land. Momper was part of a group of Baroque Flemish landscapists who painted larger, more fantastical and seemingly old-fashioned views than other landcapists. These always featured mountainous topography and exotic lands. Rather than the more realistic landscapists being innovators, it was painters like de Momper who painted more imaginary landscapes (which were paid more) to please the sophisticated tastes of patrons and art collectors. In this painting, the influence of Pieter Bruegel the Elder is perceivable in many ways. Notably, the high horizon. This painting has been part of the Spanish Royal Collection since at least the beginning of the 18th century. In 1700, it was housed at the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. Today, it is in the Museum of Prado in the same city.

The municipal device was widely used in the early twentieth century on civic vehicles and buildings but fell out of favor in the latter half of the century. The exact reasons for its decreased use are unknown, but was possibly motivated by concerns it would be confused with the peace sign, especially as some agencies purposefully flipped the device to celebrate the reversal of the Chicago River.

Early years Otto Lindner was born on 10 August 1852 in Berlin. His parents were Heinrich Ernst Lindner and Henrietta-Augusta Teubert, both Saxon. He married Marie-Ursule-Eugénie Leclercq. He was trained as an engineering technician in Berlin. Loango expedition (1873–1876) As a young man Lindner was part of the \\"Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Erforschung Aequatorial-Africas” expedition to the Loango region in 1873–1876. He embarked at Liverpool on 1 October 1873 in the company of Dr. . He was employed at the Chinchoxo base in various technical occupations. In June–July 1874 he accompanied the expedition head Dr. Paul Güssfeldt on an exploration of the Kwilu River. He became seriously ill and returned. On 7 February 1875 while hunting buffalo Lindner was wounded by a gunshot from an unknown African. In early January 1876, Lindner, Dr. Falkenstein and Dr Eduard Pechuël-Loesche, came to the aid of the French mission of the Fathers of the Holy Spirit in Landana. On 5 May 1876 the German scientific mission embarked at Landana without having achieved all its goals. Later career Otto Lindner returned to Africa in the service of the Rotterdam-based \\"Afrikaansche Handelsvereeniging\\" (African Trade Association). He landed at Banana at the mouth of the Congo River on 16 January 1877. He was in charge of the Ponta da Lenha factory and associated commercial facilities for more than four years. During this period he came to know Henry Morton Stanley. Lindner left Banana on 10 July 1880 after his contract expired. On 19 August 1880 he joined the Comité d'Études du Haut-Congo (Upper Congo Study Committee), an instrument of King Leopold II of Belgium, and remained in the king´s service until 1 December 1885. On 30 March 1881 Maximilien Strauch wrote to Lindner, In June 1881 Otto Lindner reached Stanley at Manyanga with a contingent of new recruits from Zanzibar and letters from the last six months. In 1881–82 he was in command of Vivi in the lower Congo region, where Louis-Gustave Amelot stayed for about a year. Leopold named Lindner at different times for recruiting missions he planned in China, Lagos, Liberia and Tana, and for founding a trading and shipping company. From February to July 1886 the Congo Free State employed Lindner on a recruiting mission in Damaraland. Lindner joined the Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l’Industrie (Congo Company for Commerce and Industry) as secretary at the start of 1887. On 19 January 1888 in Schaerbeek he married a French woman, Marie Leclercq. On 7 June 1888 he became a naturalized Belgian citizen. In 1893 the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Congo (Congo Railway Company) sent him to South Africa to buy oxen and wagons made of special wood. In 1900 he undertook a mission in China and Japan for the Compagnie Belge Commerciale, Industrielle et Minière pour l’Extrême- Orient (Belgian Far East Commercial, Industrial and Mining Company). In 1902 the same company sent him on a prospecting mission to the Kouilou-Niari River. On 17 August 1907 Lindner set out from Brussels on a trip to China for the Compagnie Générale des Conduites d’Eau (General Water Pipe Company) of Liège to examine the possibility of sales outlets. Nothing came out of the trip due to the Chinese financial difficulties. His travel diary has survived for his journey from Zhenjiang, near Shanghai, to Chengdu in the province of Sichuan in 1908. Lindner returned to Belgium in 1909. As a reward for his patriotism, and for improving the Viven-Bessières grenade and developing an aviation bomb, Linder was granted full citizenship on 2 August 1926. That year he left Ixelles to settle in Ypres and to indulge in hunting and fishing. Lindner died on 16 February 1945 in Ypres.

Completed and commissioned in November 1943, she served in World War II and conducted six war patrols, sinking a destroyer escort on one of them, before she was sunk in March 1945. Design and description The submarines of the K6 sub-class were versions of the preceding K5 sub-class with greater range and diving depth. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 187 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor.Chesneau, p. 203 They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-41 was laid down on 6 October 1942 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 207. She was launched on 5 May 1943 and was renamed Ro-41 that day. She was completed and commissioned on 26 November 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-41 was attached to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. On 5 March 1944, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet. She departed Kure, Japan, that day bound for Truk, which she reached on 14 March 1944. =First war patrol= Ro-41 got underway from Truk on 17 March 1944 to begin her first war patrol, ordered to intercept the battleships of United States Navy Task Group 50.10, which the submarine had sighted. Ro-41 patrolled southeast of Truk, but did not find any enemy ships. On 23 March 1944, she received orders to move to a new patrol area east of Jaluit Atoll. While returning to Truk on 18 April 1944, she and the submarines and are ordered to intercept an Allied task force Japanese forces had sighted south of Truk, but she was ordered back to Truk on 19 April 1944 before she found any Allied ships. =Second war patrol= Ro-41 began her second war patrol on 23 April 1944, departing Truk to head for a patrol area north of Hollandia, New Guinea. On 26 April 1944, she was reassigned to Submarine Group B and ordered to move to the vicinity of Mereyon Island at Woleai in the Caroline Islands to intercept an Allied task force. She found no Allied ships, and departed her patrol area on 2 May 1944. After calling at Saipan from 7 to 10 May 1944, she headed for Truk, which she reached on 13 May 1944. =Kusaie supply run= U.S. Navy forces received Ultra intelligence information that Ro-41 would depart Truk at 13:00 on 24 May 1944 to make a supply run to Kusaie, where she was scheduled to arrive on 28 May 1944 at 16:30. To intercept her, the destroyer got underway from the anchorage at Jaluit Atoll to intercept Ro-41. The destroyer escorts and later joined Eaton. Ro-41 left Truk on 24 May 1944 as scheduled and set course for Kusaie with a cargo of 12 metric tons of rice. She arrived south of Kusaie on the morning of 30 May 1944 and approached the harbor at Utwa. After dark, she surfaced and contacted the Japanese garrison of Kusaie, but her lookouts soon reported the arrival of three American ships — presumably Eaton, Greiner, and Sanders — which they identified as a destroyer and two patrol boats. The U.S. ships appeared not to notice Ro-41, but when an Allied patrol plane also arrived on the scene, Ro-41 withdrew. The three American ships had left the area by around 17:00 Japan Standard Time, and Ro-41 entered the harbor at Utwa and began to unload her cargo, but after about 15 minutes the three ships appeared again. Ro-41′s crew also noted flights by Allied patrol aircraft, but the submarine went unnoticed and the Japanese managed to unload her cargo on 31 May 1944 during a lull in the flights. Ro-41′s commanding officer sent a message to Truk opining that the Allied activity surrounding Ro-41′s visit to Kusaie indicated that the Allies were decrypting and reading coded Japanese signals, and in response the Japanese drastically reduced communications with the garrison on Kusaie pending the issuance of new codes and ordered the submarine , which was headed to Kusaie, to divert to Ponape. Meanwhile, Ro-41 departed Kusaie on 1 June 1944 and moved to a patrol area west of Jaluit Atoll, and on 6 June 1944, the U.S. Navy destroyer escort arrived off Kusaie in a belated attempt to intercept her there. Ro-41′s sound operator reporting hearing the propeller noises of an Allied convoy west of Jaluit on 12 June 1944, but Ro-41 did not intercept the convoy. =Marianas campaign= On 13 June 1944 the Combined Fleet activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands, and that day the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, ordered all available Japanese submarines, including Ro-41, to deploy east of the Marianas. The Marianas campaign began with the U.S. invasion of Saipan on 15 June 1944, and on 16 June the 6th Fleet ordered most of the submarines, again including Ro-41, to withdraw from the Marianas. =July–September 1944= On 22 June 1944, Ro-41 received orders to return to Japan and rendezvous with the submarine tender in the western Seto Inland Sea for repairs and provisions. After stopping in the western Seto Inland Sea on 4 July 1944, she continued on to Sasebo, which she reached on 5 July 1944. At Sasebo, she began repairs and an overhaul which probably included the installation of a Type 13 air-search radar and a Type 22 surface-search radar. =Third war patrol= On 15 September 1944, U.S. forces landed on Peleliu and on Angaur in the Palau Islands, and on 18 September, with her repairs and overhaul complete, Ro-41 got underway from Kure to begin her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Palaus east of the Philippine Islands. On 24 September 1944, she received orders to move to the Morotai area. She was east of Morotai on 3 October 1944 when at 08:07 she fired all four of her remaining torpedoes at the U.S. Navy escort aircraft carriers and . Ro-41′s crew heard two explosions, and her commanding officer believed that she had sunk one of the carriers and damaged the other. In fact, her torpedoes missed both carriers, although one hit the destroyer escort in the stern. Another destroyer escort, , depth-charged Ro-41, but Ro-41 escaped. Richard M. Rowell then took off Shelton′s crew. After an aircraft from Midway detected a submarine and dropped a bomb and a dye marker at its location, Richard M. Rowell attacked and sank the submarine with Hedgehog projectiles. It later became apparent that the submarine she mistakenly sank was . Shelton, meanwhile, was taken under tow, but capsized and sank at . On 10 October 1944, two Kanoya-based Yokosuka D4Y Suisei (\\"Comet\\"; Allied reporting name \\"Judy\\") reconnaissance planes reported a U.S. force of three aircraft carriers and two destroyers southeast of Okinawa steaming northeast, which the Japanese believed to be part of U.S. Navy Task Force 38. Ro-41 and the submarines and were ordered to intercept the ships. Ro-41 did not find the carriers, and she returned to Kure on 14 October 1944. She erroneously received credit for sinking one aircraft carrier during her patrol. =Fourth war patrol= Ro-41 was reassigned to Submarine Group B on 18 October 1944. On 20 October, the Philippines campaign and the Battle of Leyte began when U.S. forces landed on Leyte in the Philippine Islands, and that day Ro-41 got underway from Kure to begin her fourth war patrol, bound for a patrol area in the Philippine Sea east of Samar. The Japanese naval reaction to the invasion resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which lasted from 23 to 26 October 1944, but she saw no action in the battle. She sighted a U.S. aircraft carrier escorted by several destroyers east of Samar on 27 October 1944. On 31 October 1944 she and the submarine received orders to patrol in the San Bernardino Strait between Luzon and Samar and report and attack any Allied forces attempting to interfere with Japanese convoys bringing supplies and reinforcements from Manila to Leyte, and she was east of Legaspi on 7 November 1944 when she made sound contact on a westbound Allied task force. Ordered back to Japan on 8 November 1944, she made sound contact on a westbound Allied convoy at 02:40 on 12 November before arriving at Maizuru on 18 November 1944. =Fifth war patrol= Ro-41 departed Tokuyama on 24 December 1944 for her fifth war patrol, assigned a patrol area northeast of the Philippine Islands. By 4 January 1945 she was operating west of Luzon. U.S. forces entered Lingayen Gulf and U.S. forces landed on Luzon on 9 January 1945, but Ro-41 did not engage any Allied forces during her patrol. She arrived at Kure on 31 January 1945. =Sixth war patrol= On 7 March 1945, Ro-41 arrived Maizuru, then departed the same day bound for Kure. She got underway from Kure on 10 March 1945 to carry supplies to Truk, but on 13 March received orders to abort her supply run and return to Japan so that she could take part in an interception of U.S. Navy Task Force 58. After an overnight stay at Kure from 15 to 16 March 1945, she moved on to Saeki. On 18 March 1945, she departed Saeki as the first of a force of submarines that also included , , and with orders to attempt to intercept the damaged U.S. aircraft carrier . The U.S. Navy submarine disappeared after transmitting a routine weather report south of Kyushu while proceeding east on 20 March 1945 while Ro-41 was in the area heading south, and some historians have credited Ro-41 with sinking Kete. Ro-41 never reported sinking, or even sighting, an enemy submarine, so it seems unlikely that she sank Kete. On 22 March 1945, Ro-41 was east of Okinawa when she transmitted a message reporting that she had sighted an enemy destroyer. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= Later on 22 March 1945, the destroyer was operating as a picket ahead of Task Force 58 when her radar detected a vessel on the surface at a range of at 23:42. She and the destroyer closed the range. The contact disappeared from radar, indicating a diving submarine, but Haggard detected it on sonar and attacked it with depth charges. Shortly before midnight, the submarine broached off Haggard′s port beam, and Haggard′s Bofors 40 mm guns opened fire on its conning tower. Haggard turned hard to port and rammed the submarine on its starboard side abaft its conning tower. On 23 March 1945, the submarine sank by the stern at shortly after midnight, leaving no survivors. Having suffered heavy bow damage while ramming the submarine, Haggard proceeded to the fleet anchorage at Ulithi Atoll for repairs, accompanied by Uhlmann.

In 1534, he co-signed a letter from the scholars of Trinity Hall, Cambridge to Thomas Cromwell, defending a member of the college against a charge of treason. He was elected MP for Ludgershall in the parliament of 1547–1552. He then went to Ireland, where he was appointed a clerk of the pipe at the Irish Exchequer on 23 November 1553. By 1555 he was secretary to Sir Anthony St Leger, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. He was appointed a clerk of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1559. He then entered the church, and was instituted rector of Acton, Middlesex on 26 February 1563. In this capacity he was a member of the Convocation of 1563 as a clerical proctor for Surrey, voting for the \\"six articles\\" compromise (which was defeated) and signing a petition of the Lower House for discipline. In 1573, Cockerell was party to a case in the Court of Requests: John Garaway of Buckhurst, Sussex complained that Cockerell had dishonestly procured from a third party an indenture made some four years previously by which Garaway was to pay Cockerell £50 a year for a lease of the rectory and advowson of Acton. Cockerell probably died early in 1576: his successor as rector of Acton was instituted on 3 May 1576.

The goal of the marine conservation area is to work with local Inuit to conserve the rich biodiversity of Lancaster Sound and its adjacent waterways. Once formally established under the Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act, it will become the largest Parks Canada-managed protected area and the second largest protected area in Canada after Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area. History In 2009, the governments of Canada and Nunavut and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association (QIA) signed a memorandum of understanding to begin assessing the feasibility of establishing a NMCA in Lancaster Sound. It also established the Steering Committee to conduct consultations with local communities and key stakeholders. In 2010, Parks Canada announced a potential future boundary of for an NMCA in Lancaster Sound. Additional studies and consultations were performed in the years that followed to determine what marine areas should be included or excluded from the proposed NMCA. In February 2017, the Steering Committee submitted its report and recommendations on the feasibility of an NMCA in Lancaster Sound to the ministers of Environment for Canada and Nunavut, and to the President of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association (QIA) in February 2017. The Senior Mineral and Energy Resource Assessment Committee approved of the Steering Committee’s recommended boundary the following May. The Governments of Canada and Nunavut and the QIA began negotiations on an Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement the following August. In August 2019, the Government of Canada and the QIA announced the signing of an Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement (IIBA), required for final establishment of Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area. With the signing of the IIBA, Parks Canada and QIA will begin to operationalize the NMCA. As of September 2020, formal establishment under the Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act has yet to occur. Geography The NCMA covers an area of stretching from Baffin Bay between Buchan Gulf and southeastern Ellesmere Island, to the 96th meridian west between Cornwallis Island and Somerset Island. It would surround the marine portions of Sirmilik National Park, Nirjutiqavvik National Wildlife Area, Bylot Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary, and Prince Leopold Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary. Ecology The ecological importance of Lancaster Sound is due to the presence of polynyas in its waters. These small pockets of open water provide refuge for Arctic marine and bird species during winter months. These winter refuges are also areas where Inuit undertake many traditional activities.

She works mainly in the field of high energy X-ray astrophysics, with very significant contributions in the topic of turbulent heating in clusters of galaxies. She is active in the fields of the physics of galaxy clusters, groups, and most massive galaxies. She is involved in the development of several future X-ray observatories, such as XRISM, Lynx and Athena. She received several prizes and accolades for her studies, including the Otto Hahn Medal prize of the Max Planck Society in 2013.  Education and career path  Irina Zhuravleva received her master of science from the Saint- Petersburg State University (Russia) in 2008, before moving to the Ludwig- Maximilian University and the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (Germany) for her Ph.D., which she obtained in 2011. After that, she was a postdoctoral associate at Stanford University before becoming an assistant professor of Astronomy at the University of Chicago.  Scientific contributions  Irina Zhuravleva contributed significantly to understanding the physics of clusters of galaxies and, in particular, how the intra-cluster medium (ICM) is able to reach temperatures high enough (10 to 100 million degrees Kelvin) to emit hard X-ray photons. In particular, combining new theoretical models and observations from X-ray telescopes, she suggested that turbulent heating can play a significant role in keeping the gas in the ICM sufficiently hot. Additional, significant contributions to the field are associated with the study of the density fluctuations in the Perseus cluster of galaxies.  X-ray telescopes  Professor Zhuravleva is also actively involved in the planning and development of several future X-ray observatories, which will take the place of the current Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories in the next decades. In particular, she is involved in the development of the X-ray telescope Athena from the European Space Agency. In addition, she is involved in the development of XRISM and Lynx.

Located at the San Francisco Presidio, the camp, named after Major General Henry C. Merriam, the Commanding General of the Department of the Pacific. Camp Merriam was located on the hills just north of the Lombard Street entrance to the Presidio of San Francisco. The camp was established in 1898 to quarter and train volunteer soldiers from California, Iowa, Kansas, and South Dakota for service during in the Spanish-American War. Commissioning Camp Merriam was established in July 1898 when it became clear that Camp Merrit, which had been used up until then for quartering and training the volunteer armies before being shipped out to the Philippines to support the war effort there, was no longer capable of fulfilling its mission. Major General Merriam had already been given command of the Department of the Pacific, which included all military operations of the western states of the U.S. as well as those currently in operation on the Islands of Hawaii. On July 19, 1898, Brigadier General Marcus P. Miller, the commanding general of the Volunteer Armies being processed through Camp Merritt received a telegram from the Secretary of War directing that \\"... all commanding officers of regiments at Camp Merritt report to General Merriam for further equipment and instructions ...\\" and that \\"...

He collected plants in France, Spain, and Morocco. Biography Based for many years at the École Chrétiennes de Beziers in southern France, Frère Sennen collected a vast number of botanical specimens in the Languedoc. He published work on the flora of Beziers with Abbé Hippolyte-Jacques Coste (1858–1924). In 1894 Sennen was elected a member of the Société botanique de France. In 1904 he was appointed director of the Christian Brothers school in Figueres, Catalonia. He collected plants in the region of Ampurdan in Spain and then extended his studies to all Spain. In the early 1930s he collected plants in Morocco, especially near Melilla. At the Instituto Botánico de Barcelona, one of the main preserved historical herbaria is that of Frère Sennen. He distributed more than 400,000 botanical specimens to the main European institutions of his time. The 10,309 specimens of the thirty series that constitute his exsiccata \\"Plantes d'Espagne\\" were prepared and published between 1907 and 1937. The Sennen herbarium contains about eighty-five specimens. Barcelona's contains a herbarium with about 40,000 specimens collected by Sennen. When the Spanish Revolution of 1936 began, he left Spain and settled in Marseille, dying there suddenly in January 1937. Frère Sennen was the vice-president of the Société botanique de France, the president of the Sociedad Ibérica de Ciencias Naturales, a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona, and an honorary member of the Institució Catalana de Ciències Naturals.

It is native to Southeast Asia. Etymology The specific epithet simplex derives from the Latin word for \\"single\\", referring to the fact that the species is single-stemmed. Description Flowers The Malayan sword is a shrubby plant that grows to about tall with straight stems. Its dark-green leaves are arranged spirally. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a length between 10 – 35 cm and a width between 1.9 – 25 cm, and sunken veins. The fruits are red and ovoid. The seeds are possibly dispersed by mammals and birds. Its flowers are enclosed in a very greenish-white leaf. They are also a monoecious species. They are pollinated by carrion insects. This species grows relatively slowly. They are suited to moist, well-drained soil although they are tolerant to waterlogging. They prefer to be situated in shaded areas. In addition, they can be propagated with cuttings. They begin to flower between late summer and early autumn. This species contains 20 chromosomes. It also has a high amount of variation, with some individuals having narrow leaves, while others have broad leaves. Distribution This flower is usually found wet tropical and sub- tropical forests and freshwater swamps in Bangladesh, Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. They can be found at elevations between 0 - 1500m. Status The Aglaonema simplex is listed as least concern by the IUCN. While this species is abundant, its native habitat is threatened by deforestation for wood harvesting and wood plantations. Uses =Ornamental= This species is used in horticulture for the aquarium trade. Due to its slow-growing nature, bushy appearance and its ability to filter air, they are popular as a houseplant and are commercially sold. =Medicinal= The leaves of the Aglaonema simplex are pounded in coconut oil to be rubbed on the bodies on pregnant women going through labour in order to hasten delivery and reduce childbirth pain. In addition, a decoction made from the roots of this plant is used to treat edemas and fever. In the leaves and stems of Aglaonema simplex, five different photocytotoxic pheophorbide-related compounds are present. Due to the way that they interact with human leukaemia cells, they have been proposed as a potential treatment for tumour cells. Toxicity Like all Aglaonema species, Aglaonema simplex contains poisonous calcium oxalate crystals, which act as an irritant.

She was described as \\"swashbuckling\\" and was a distinctive figure in motor racing, dressed in cherry-red from head-to-toe whenever she appeared at the race track. She was born Eileen May Fountain in 1902 into a family made wealthy from their coal businesses. Along with her first husband, William Berkeley \\"Bummer\\" Scott, she lived in a large house near the Brooklands race track in Surrey, England, and the couple were early and enthusiastic collectors of automobiles. They bought their first Sunbeam Indianapolis shortly after their marriage and quickly added several Bugattis to their collection. Their cars all wore a distinctive black livery with emerald green wheels, and the couple collected frequent trophies racing their Bugattis at the nearby track. Following the death of J. G. Parry-Thomas, they bought two of his cars, one of which Scott used to exceed 120 miles-per-hour on the Brooklands track, granting her the right to display a coveted British Automobile Racing Club badge acknowledging the achievement. In 1928 she became the first woman elected to the British Racing Drivers' Club. In 1930 she divorced William and married another driver, Ernest Mortimer Thomas, who was also a former RAF pilot. Scott herself had learned to fly a few years earlier, in 1927, and operated an Avro Avian. She and her new husband continued to race at Brooklands for many years, her in an Alfa Romeo and him in a Frazer Nash. Scott died in 1974. Thomas died a few months later.

In 1142, the Emperor Alfonso VII gave a piece of land to his majordomo, Count Ponce de Minerva. Known as Sotnoval or Saltus Novalis, it lay near the confluence of the rivers Porma and Esla a few miles outside the city of León. In 1167, Ponce and his wife, Estefanía Ramírez, with the consent of their children, Ramiro, María and Sancha, gave the land to Abbot Diego Martínez of the monastery of Santa María de La Santa Espina for the construction of a new Cistercian monastery. Monastic life began at Sandoval in 1171 with twelve monks from La Santa Espina under Abbot Diego. Although Sandoval began as a daughter house of La Santa Espina, in a short time it would equal its spiritual parent in importance. Among Sandoval's early patrons was Urraca, daughter of Alfonso VII, whose anniversary mass was celebrated there on 25 June. The monastery received not only real property in donations, such as dehesas, but also feudal rights. In 1222, the monastery received land and dehesas from King Ferdinand III. It also had a small daughter house of its own at Valdellán. After 1487, Sandoval became part of the Congregation of Castile, a group of reformed Spanish Cistercian houses founded by Martín de Vargas. In 1835, the monks abandoned the monastery during the first confiscation of Mendizábal. It continued to be used as a parish church and services are still occasionally celebrated there.

Among the reasons art may be displayed are aesthetic enjoyment, cultural enrichment, or for marketing purposes. While \\"gallery\\" continues to be used in the name of institutions for the study, preservation, and restoration as well as the display of art, these additional functions identify the institution as an Art museum. The majority of art galleries open to the public are commercial enterprises for the sale of artwork, others may be part of art cooperatives or non-profit organizations. As part of the art world, art galleries play an important role in maintaining the network of connections that define fine art. History In Western cultures from the mid-15th Century, a gallery was any long, narrow covered passage along a wall, first used in the sense of a place for art in the 1590s. The Long gallery in Elizabethan and Jacobean houses served many purposes including the display of art. Art is displayed not only for aesthetic enjoyment, but also as evidence of status and wealth, and for religious art as objects of ritual or the depiction of narratives. The first galleries were in the palaces of the aristocracy, or in churches. As art collections grew, buildings became dedicated to art, then becoming the first art museums. Exhibitions of art operating similar to current galleries for marketing art first appeared in the early modern period, approximately 1500 to 1800 CE. In the middle ages that preceded, painters and sculptors were members of guilds, seeking commissions to produce artworks for aristocratic patrons or churches. The establishment of academies of art in the 16th century represented efforts by painters and sculptors to raise their status from mere artisans who worked with their hands to that of the classical arts such as poetry and music, which are purely intellectual pursuits. However, the public exhibition of art had to overcome the bias against commercial activity, which was deemed beneath the dignity of artists in many European societies. Art galleries were well-established by the Victorian era, made possible by the increasing number of people seeking to own objects of cultural and aesthetic value. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century there were also the first indications of modern values regarding art; art as an investment versus pure aesthetics, and the increased attention to living artists as an opportunity for such investment. Galleries and the art world The art world comprises everyone involved in the production and distribution of fine art. The market for fine art depends upon maintaining its distinction as high culture, although during recent decades the boundary between high and popular culture has been eroded by postmodernism. In the case of historical works, or Old Masters this distinction is maintained by the works provenance; proof of its origin and history. For more recent work, status is based upon the reputation of the artist. Reputation includes both aesthetic factors; art schools attended, membership in a stylistic or historical movement, the opinions of art historians and critics; and economic factors; inclusion in group and solo exhibitions and past success in the art market. Art dealers, through their galleries, have occupied a central role in the art world by bringing many of these factors together; such as \\"discovering\\" new artists, promoting their associations in group shows, and managing market valuation. Gallery Opening, July 2015 Commercial galleries Commercial galleries owned or operated by an art dealer or \\"gallerist\\" occupy the middle tier of the art market, accounting for the majority of transactions although not the highest monetary values. Once limited to major urban art worlds such as New York, Paris and London, art galleries have become global. Another trend in globalization is that while maintaining their urban establishments, galleries also participate in art fairs such as Art Basel and Freize Art Fair. Art galleries are the primary connection between artists and collectors. At the high end of the market, a handful of elite auction houses and dealers sell the work of celebrity artists; at the low end artists sell their work from their studio, or in informal venues such as restaurants. Point-of-sale galleries connect artists with buyers by hosting exhibitions and openings. The artworks are on consignment, with the artist and the gallery splitting the proceeds from each sale. Depending upon the expertise of the gallery owner and staff, and the particular market, the artwork shown may be more innovative or more traditional in style and media. =Types of galleries= Galleries may deal in the primary market of new works by living artists, or the secondary markets for works from prior periods owned by collectors, estates, or museums. The periods represented include Old Masters, Modern (1900-1950), and contemporary (1950-present). Modern and contemporary may be combined in the category of Post-war art; while contemporary may be limited to the 21st century or \\"emerging artists\\". Contemporary galleries An enduring model for contemporary galleries was set by Leo Castelli. Rather than simply being the broker for sales, Castelli became actively involved in the discovery and development of new artists, while expecting to remain an exclusive agent for their work. However he also focused exclusively on new works, not participating in the resale of older work by the same artists. Secondary market All art sales after the first are part of the secondary market, in which the artist and the original dealer are not involved. Many of these sales occur privately between collectors, or works are sold at auctions. However some galleries participate in the secondary market depending upon the market conditions. As with any market, the major conditions are supply and demand. Because art is a unique commodity, the artist has a monopoly on production, which ceases when the artist either dies or stops working. Outside the art world Some businesses operate as vanity galleries, charging artists a fee to exhibit their work. Lacking a selection process to assure the quality of the artworks, and having little incentive to promote sales, vanity galleries are avoided as unprofessional. Non-profit galleries Some non-profit organizations or local governments host art galleries for cultural enrichment and to support local artists. Non-profit organizations may start as exhibit spaces for artist collectives, and expand into full-fledged arts programs. Other non-profits include the arts as part of other missions, such as providing services to low-income neighborhoods. * Artists Space was founded in 1972 in SoHo, New York City. * Westbeth Gallery is operated by the Westbeth Artists Residents Council Arts districts Historically, art world activities have benefited from clustering together either in cities or in remote areas offering natural beauty. The proximity of art galleries facilitated an informal tradition of art show openings on the same night, which have become officially coordinated as \\"first Friday events\\" in a number of locations. Galleries selling the work of recognized artists may occupy space in established commercial areas of a city. New styles in art have historically been attracted to the low rent of marginal neighborhoods. An artist colony existed in Greenwich Village as early as 1850, and the tenements built around Washington Square Park to house immigrants after the Civil War also attracted young artists and avant garde art galleries. The resulting gentrification prompted the arts to move to the neighborhood \\"south of Houston\\" (SoHo) which became gentrified in turn. Attempting to recreate this natural process, arts districts have been created intentionally by local governments in partnership with private developers as a strategy for revitalizing neighborhoods. Such developments often include spaces for artists to live and work as well as galleries.

During the 16th and 17th centuries Hungary was divided into three parts: Austrian Hungary, Ottoman Hungary and Transylvania, with some differences between them in regard to the witch hunt. The most intense period of witch hunt in Hungary took place in the 18th- century, at a time when they were rare in the rest of Europe except Poland, and finally stopped in 1768 by rule of Austria which controlled Hungary at the time. Chronology Magic was banned by king Stephen I of Hungary when Hungary became a Christian country in the 11th-century, but only if magic was used to cause someone's death (maleficium and veneficium). While witch trials were generally uncommon in Europe during the Middle Ages, at least fifteen executions by burning for witchcraft are documented between 1360 and 1437, most of whom in present-day Croatia.Ankarloo, Bengt & Henningsen, Gustav (ed.), Skrifter. Bd. 13, Häxornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier, Stockholm: Nerenius & Santérus, 1987 The witch hunt in Hungary became more intense in the late 16th -century, but was in its most intense phase between 1690 and 1750. Between 1520 and 1780, 1.644 people (1482 women and 160 men) are documented to have been put on trial for sorcery in Hungary, but the undocumented cases are estimated to be at least 800 cases. The most famous case was perhaps the Szeged witch trials of 1728, in which 13 people were burned at the stake. Regional situation Between 1526 and 1699, Hungary was divided in three parts: Northern Hungary (Croatia, Slovenia and Slovakia), which belonged to Austria; Southern Hungary, which belonged to the Ottoman Empire; and Eastern Hungary (Transylvania) which was an autonomous Princely state under Ottoman. In 1699, Hungary was again united under Austrian rule. Witch trials were conducted in all of these parts, with some differences in its practice. Northern Hungary was affected by the severe witch trials of Catholic Austria. In Southern Hungary the Ottoman authorities lacked any interests in the Christian witchcraft persecutions, however in the Ottoman Empire religious minorities handled their own legal trials. In Transylvania, the city population was generally of German heritage, and the witch trials were conducted by the German church under influence from Germany, where the witch trials in the Holy Roman Empire were arguably the worst in Europe, and a Witchcraft Act was introduced in Transylvania in 1614. From the 1690s, when Hungary was conquered from the Ottoman Empire and united under Austrian rule, the Austrian Witchcraft Act of 1656, the Practica Rerum Criminalum was applied in all of Hungary. The witch trials In Hungary, a witchcraft case often originated from a conflict between individuals or families. In contrast to many other countries, they occurred in all classes of society, both among the peasantry, the merchant class as well as among the nobility, and a normal case was caused by a conflict between two people, in which one family accused a rival family from having caused them injury by the help of witchcraft. When an aristocrat was accused, they were defended by a lawyer and was more often able to summon witness to testify to their defense. It was also common for villages to be accused by Austrian soldiers which were quartered in the village. In witchcraft cases, it was not uncommon for commoners to successfully accuse aristocrats, and children to point out adults, which was otherwise uncommon. Among common victims of the witch trials were the folk healers (tudos), as was the taltos, men and women who functioned as shamans, a position which still existed in Hungary from the pre-Christian Pagan Hungarian religion. The taltos claimed to regularly leave their body to attend gatherings of other taltos with whom they performed ritual conflicts, a phenomenon from Pagan belief which the authorities interpreted to be a Witches' Sabbath. In Hungary, witch trials in the cities were conducted by the city courts, while witch trials in rural areas were conducted by the private feudal courts of the estates belonging to the nobility. The ordeal of water and torture was commonly used in Hungarian witch trials both to confess guilt and point out accomplices, and the method of execution was commonly burning at the stake or to be buried alive. End In the mid 18th-century witch trials was commonly considered outdated in most of Europe except Poland, but in Hungary, they had reached their most intense stage. This was a matter of embarrassment to Austria (who controlled Hungary) and the royal court physician Gerard van Swieten convinced Empress Maria Theresa that the witch trials in Hungary must be stopped. This resulted in a royal command which summarily repelled Hungarian witchcraft convictions from 1756 onward, ending witchcraft executions, and finally in a law banning the death penalty for witchcraft in Hungary in 1768. Despite the law, however, an illegal witch trial was conducted which ended in an execution i Kesmark (Kezmarok) in 1777, which was to become the last witchcraft execution in Hungary.

He is a Western painter of Japanese Joseon and South Korea.In 1937, at the age of 17, he went to Japan to study art. In 1943, he graduated from the Department of Western Painting at the Kawabata Art School in Japan. He entered Japan through the \\"Japan Free Artists Association\\". After liberation, he continued his artistic activities in the region for the development of watercolor, which had not been noticed in Korea. It is evaluated that he has a unique style of painting that adjusted his Parisian style to a Japanese style.  Early life  Bae Dong-shin was born as the third son between Seong-jae Bae and Ok-jin Cho, who run an herbal medicine clinic. There were two older brothers and one younger brother and two younger sisters. However, Dong-shin Bae's biological mother was Ok-hee Cheon. Dong- shin's father, was away busy traveling he taught his young son Dong-shin to do or teach the medicines he should do when he was away. His father wanted Dong- shin to succeed the family business and trained his son, Dong-shin, who liked to read and while looking at picture books. The basics of oriental medicine is to learn the shape and properties of plants, animals, and natural elements that become medicinal. Dong-shin Bae had to look at the encyclopedia, draw it as it is, transcribing it in Chinese, and learn hieroglyphs, which are Chinese. Observing, drawing, and writing naturally led the Dong-shin Bae to the path of painting.  Career  1937, he went to Japan to study art. In 1943, he graduated from the Department of Western Painting at Kawabata Art School in Japan. In 1943, he became a member of the Japan Free Artists Association. 1944, returned home. 1945, Liberation. He opened his first solo exhibition in Gwangju in 1947.

He held solo exhibitions in Seoul, Tokyo and Osaka. In 1968 he became the first president of the Watercolor Creators Association. In 1970, he created an art group called \\"Hwangtohoe\\" with Oh Ji-ho, Park Chul-gyo, Kang Yeon-gyun, Woo Je-Gil, Kim Young-Tae, Choi Yong-gap, Kim In-Gyu, Kang Dong-moon, Kim Soo-ho. And he was invited as major members of the 1972 Gusang-jeon. In 1975, he served as the first president of the Korea Watercolor Association. Since 1973, it has been invited to the National Museum of Contemporary Art every year. In 1998, an exhibition was held in his hometown of Gwangju to commemorate Bae Dong-shin's 60 years of watercolor painting. In 2000, he was awarded the Korea Archives of Culture Medalhe was awarded the Korea Archives of Culture Medal  Review  * In July 2008, adjunct professor Okjo Kim (art critic) evaluated Dong-shin Bae as an artist who pursued the deepest flow of our spirit with the easiest materials and expression methods. * In the August 1973 issue of ShinDongA, art critic Lee Kyung-seongLee Kyung-seong (1919~2009) Art critic Artist, art theorist, and art administrator who served as the director of the Incheon City Museum, the National Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Walkerhill Museum of Art said, “In the barren Korean watercolor group, the existence of Dong-shin Bae is absolutely essential. Of course, the place he listed as an author was in a foreign country called Japan. Here, he studied the technique and spirit of watercolor newly accepted from Europe, and started his path as a writer by getting along with them. He was honest and clean in nature, and he was a so-called Ecole de Parisian artist, who did not know the desire of water. Therefore, his life is truly a continuation of the pure lives of artists.

This strait has a minimum width of 19.4 km (12.05 mi) between Galiano Island and Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal. History The idea of constructing a fixed link has existed since the late 1800s. Public support for a fixed link resurfaced following a strike by employees of CP Steamships and the Black Ball Line in 1958 and the subsequent establishment of BC Ferries in 1960. Support again resurfaced following a controversial fare hikes in 1976. This led to a variety of studies to be published examining the feasibility of constructing a fixed link. A series of controversial fare hikes during the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 again stoked calls for a fixed link. Feasibility Various studies were conducted throughout the 1980s and 1990s to assess the feasibility of constructing a fixed link between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland across the strait. Proposals varied greatly in length and utilized one or more of the northern Gulf Islands as an anchorage point. Fixed link designs included a bored tunnel, submerged floating tunnel, floating bridge, and cable-stayed bridge. Challenges to establishing a fixed link include the presence of large cargo ships in the area, the depth of the Georgia Strait (up to 365 m deep), the depth of soft sediments found on the ocean bed (up to 450 m thick), potential marine slope instabilities along the eastern side of the strait, extreme wave conditions (4-7 m waves, with 6 m tides and 2-knot current), extreme wind speeds (up to 115 km/h with gusts up to 180 km/h), seasonal fog, snow and ice accumulation on the structure, and the high seismic activity of the region. There are no fixed bridges or tunnels in existence today that would meet these challenging conditions. Criticisms Supporters see a fixed-link as an opportunity to boost tourism and stimulate economic growth on the Vancouver Island. Depending on the specific alignment, a fixed- link would shorten travel times by replacing one or more of BC Ferries' routes between the island and Lower Mainland. Former B.C. cabinet minister Dr. Patrick McGeer is an outspoken supporter of a fixed link. Opponents argue that improving the speed and reliability of BC Ferries service across the strait would eliminate the need for a fixed link. There are also concerns that the construction of a fixed link will result in further urbanization of the island and that the area's environment will be negatively affected by construction and increased tourism. The idea of a fixed link has formal opposition in the form of an Islands Trust policy banning the building of any bridges or tunnels connecting the Gulf Islands to the Lower Mainland or Vancouver Island.Islands Trust Policy Statement, section 5.3.2 See also *Newfoundland–Labrador fixed link *Strait of Gibraltar crossing References Category:Transport in British Columbia Category:Proposed undersea tunnels in North America Category:Proposed transport infrastructure in Canada ","title":"Vancouver Island fixed link"},{"id":"65394062","title":"2020 All-Australian team"},{"id":"65394067","text":"Little Saigon banners on El Cajon Blvd. Little Saigon, San Diego is a Vietnamese enclave in City Heights, San Diego, located on El Cajon Boulevard between Euclid and Highland avenues.

On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-42 was laid down as Submarine No. 208 on 27 April 1942 by the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan. She was renamed Ro-42 on 25 September 1942 and was attached provisionally to the Maizuru Naval District that day. She was launched on 25 October 1942 and was completed and commissioned on 31 August 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-42 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. On 30 November 1943, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet, and on 4 December 1943 she departed Maizuru, Japan, bound for Truk, which she reached on 12 December 1943. =First war patrol= Ro-40 got underway from Truk on 23 December 1943 to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area off Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. She was east of Espiritu Santo on 14 January 1944 when she torpedoed the 800-ton United States Navy fuel oil barge , which her commanding officer had mistaken for a 10,000-ton fleet oiler, at . YO-59 suffered such serious damage that U.S. forces later scuttled her. Ro-42 returned to Truk on 24 January 1944. She took aboard torpedoes from the auxiliary submarine tender there on 28 January 1944. =Operation Hailstone= During Ro-42′s stay at Truk, U.S. Navy Task Force 58 conducted Operation Hailstone, a major attack on Truk by carrier aircraft supported by anti- shipping sweeps around the atoll by surface warships, on 17 and 18 February 1944. Ro-42 and the submarines and put to sea on 17 February in an attempt to intercept the attacking ships. Ro-42 was unsuccessful, and returned to Truk on 19 February 1944. =Second war patrol= Ro-42 began her second war patrol on 25 February 1944, departing Truk to head for a patrol area east of Kusaie. On 1 March she received orders to conduct a reconnaissance of Kwajalein and then move to a new patrol area southeast of Kwajalein. After she arrived off Kwajalein, she reported on 4 March 1944 that the island′s waters were too heavily patrolled by Allied patrol boats for her to approach it for a reconnaissance. Ro-42 also began to suffer from malfunctioning equipment. She was ordered to return to her patrol. Ro-42 was southwest of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands when she sighted a convoy of six transports at 08:00 on 6 March 1944. WHile southwest of Mili on 15 March 1944, she reported sighting a battleship and five aircraft carriers of U.S. Navy Task Group 50.10, prompting the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, to order the submarines Ro-36 and to intercept the ships. On 16 March 1944, Ro-42 received orders to move to the west-southwest, and on 18 March to move another to the west. She was south of Ponape on 21 March 1944 when she sighted a three-ship convoy. On 23 March 1944, she and the submarines , Ro-36, , , , and were ordered to intercept a U.S. Navy task force that the submarine had sighted north of Jaluit Atoll that day. She did not find the task force, and she returned to Truk on 28 March 1944. =April–May 1944= Ro-42 got underway from Truk in company with the submarines , Ro-36, , and on 12 April 1944 to intercept an Allied task force Japanese forces had sighted north of Kavieng. She returned to Truk on 14 April. On 23 April 1944 she departed Truk bound for Yokosuka, Japan, which she reached on 30 April 1944. On 15 May 1944, Ro-42 departed Yokosuka with the commander of Submarine Division 34 embarked and orders to conduct a reconnaissance of the American fleet anchorage at Majuro and then proceed to an area north-northeast of Kwajalein. While she was at sea, she received orders to postpone the Majuro reconnaissance until 10 June 1944. On 10 June 1944, she was operating in the Marshall Islands when she was ordered to reconnoiter both Majuro and Kwajalein. =Loss= Ro-42 was on the surface east of Roi-Namur at 23:30 on 10 June 1944 when the destroyer escort detected her on radar. After Bangust closed, made visual contact, and flashed a challenge, Ro-42 crash-dived. Bangust searched for the submerged Ro-42 for the next eight hours and regained contact on sonar on the morning of 11 June 1944. Bangust conducted three unsuccessful 24-projectile Hedgehog attacks as Ro-42 made evasive maneuvers such as frequent hard turns and sudden changes in speed. However, her fourth Hedgehog attack resulted in a large underwater explosion that damaged Bangust′s hull. Ro-42 tried to surface, but failed, and sank at . During the morning of 11 June, a large oil slick was sighted on the surface. On 13 June 1944 the Combined Fleet activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands, and that day Vice Admiral Takagi ordered all available Japanese submarines to deploy east of the Marianas, with Ro-42 ordered to head there at flank speed. On 16 June 1944, she was assigned to Submarine Group B and ordered to move to an area southeast of the Marianas, and on 22 June 1944 she was ordered to return to Truk. She acknowledged none of the orders. On 12 July 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-42 to be presumed lost with all 73 hands. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 August 1944.

The plan called for doubling the size of Japan's economy in ten years through a combination of tax breaks, targeted investment, an expanded social safety net, and incentives to increase exports and industrial development. To achieve the goal of doubling of the economy in ten years, the plan called for an average annual economic growth rate of 7.2%. In fact, Japan's annual growth averaged more than 10% over the course of the Plan, and the economy doubled in size in less than seven years. Ikeda introduced the Income Doubling Plan in response to the massive Anpo Protests in 1960 against the US-Japan Security Treaty, as part of an effort to shift Japan's national dialogue away from contentious political struggles toward building a consensus around pursuit of rapid economic growth. However, Ikeda and his brain trust, which most notably included the economist Osamu Shimomura, had been developing the plan since mid-1959. The Income Doubling Plan was widely viewed as a success in achieving both its poilitcal and economic objectives. According to historian Nick Kapur, the plan \\"enshrined 'economic growthism' as a sort of secular religion of both the Japanese people and their government, bringing about a circumstance in which both the effectiveness of the government and the worth of the populace came to be measured above all by the annual percentage change in GDP.\\" Various aspects of the plan have been studied by other nations, especially in Asia, hoping to copy Japan's model of export-led rapid economic growth. For example, China in recent years explicitly looked to 1960s Japanese economic polices as a model.

Grinnell was a 19th-century pilot boat built in 1850 for the New Jersey maritime pilots. She was designed by the yacht designer George Steers. The Grinnell was the first pilot boat to feature a fully developed concave clipper-bow, which was to become the New York schooner-rigged pilot boat's trade mark. This new design was the basis for the celebrated yacht America. Construction and service  Moses H. Grinnell, a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, commissioned George Steers to design the vessel for use as a pilot-boat and as a yacht for pleasure trips. Grinnell was a partner with his brother, Joseph Grinnell, in the shipping firm Grinnell, Minturn & Co. The Grinnell was owned by George W. Blunt of New York. The Grinnell was the first sailing vessel to have the very long, sharp, and concave clipper-bow that became the prototype for the famous racing yacht, America. On May 2, 1851, the Grinnell, was in a race with the yacht Cornelia for a purse of $1,000. They started at Stapleton Dock, Staten Island, passed the Sandy Hook point, around the Sandy Hook lightship and back to Stapleton Dock. The Grinnell was the winner. In August 1852, William Smith and Isaac Gaynor of the pilot boat Moses H. Grinnell were picked up by the schooner Fremont, after being lost in a fog, when putting a pilot on board the ship George Canning. The Grinnell was one of only twenty-one New York pilot boats in 1860. In late October, 1863, the seven year old Grinnell was run down in the dark by the United States supply steamer Union on the Outer Middle Ground in Long Island Sound. The Grinnell carried no light when struck by the Union. No one was injured in the incident. On August 11, 1864, during the American Civil War, the Grinnell reported that they saw a vessel burning off Montauk, New York. The pilots believed that the CSS Tallahassee was working her way toward Nantucket Shoals. In 1871, the Grinnell, collided with two barques near The Battery and was damaged, ran ashore and filled with water. She was registered with the Index to Ship Registers from 1876 to 1879 with Captain J. B. Lockman as master and the N. Y. Pilots as the owners. From 1881 to 1882 she was registered with H. L. Gurney and the owners were the Boston Pilots. End of service On October 24, 1882, the Grinnell, was sold to the Pensacola, Florida pilots for $4,500. This was the third pilot-boat that was purchased from the Boston pilots. She was listed as No. 9, of the Boston fleet.

The case is notable for originating the 'Anshun estoppel' doctrine in Australian civil proceedings. The rule estops parties from making novel legal claims, when those claims should have been pursued in an earlier legal proceeding.https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=%5B1981%5D%20HCA%2045 Anshun is the 29th most cited High Court case.https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=&party1;=&party2;=&court;=High%2BCourt%2Bof%2BAustralia&juris;=&article;=&author;=&year1;=&year2;=&synonyms;=on&filter;=on&cases- cited;=&legis-cited;=&section;=&large-search-ok;=1&sort-order;=cited  Facts  The former Melbourne Port Authority building The appellant (the authority), lent a crane to Anshun Pty Ltd. While the crane was in use by Anshun, its load struck and severely injured a man named Soterales. Soterales sued both Anshun and the Port Authority in negligence. The Authority and Anshun each claimed that the other had contributed to the tort alleged. These claims were contained within notices served under Victorian Supreme Court Rules. The notice of the Authority claimed contribution, but not an indemnity. This was despite Anshun having agreed in 1968 to indemnify the Authority in the crane hiring contract. The negligence action resulted in a jury awarding ~$44,000 in damages for Soterales. No pleadings had been made regarding contribution. The jury had found both defendants jointly liable in negligence, also finding that the Authority would have to pay 90% of the damages, with Anshun paying 10%. Subsequently the Authority commenced an action against Anshun in the Supreme Court, claiming it ought to pay the Authority's share of the damages and legal costs. This was based upon the 1968 indemnity clause within the crane hiring contract. Anshun's sole defence to this claim was in estoppel, claiming that the Authority could have raised its claim against Anshun during Soterales' original lawsuit against them both. Therefore, Anshun argued; the authority should be barred against seeking an indemnity. The trial judge, O'Bryan J, dismissed Anshun's application for summary judgement. At the full heading, the primary judge held it was not a case of res judicata, or issue estoppel. However, he granted a perpetual stay on the grounds that the claim was on a matter which should have been raised in an earlier litigation, relying upon Henderson v Henderson. The Full Court agreed that while not an issue estoppel case, Henderson v Henderson applied. They held that as a reasonably diligent party would have raised the indemnity issue at the hearing; the Authority would be barred unless special circumstances existed. Finding none, they dismissed the appeal.Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589, at para.9 The Authority appealed to the High Court, submitting that the indemnity wasn't at issue in Soterales' action, and so shouldn't be prevented to litigate upon it now.Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589, at para.10  Judgement  The majority decided that the case was not strictly one of issue estoppel, as the defence of indemnity hadn't been raised at trial.Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589, at para. 21 Discussing the UK line of authority regarding Henderson v Henderson, the court cast doubt on its precedential value. However, they accepted the 'powerful arguments based on considerations of convenience and justice which were associated with it'.Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589, at para.34 The court also found that applying a legal test for abuse of process would not be helpful.Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589, at para.36 Regarding the reasonableness of raising the issue at a prior proceeding, the court said: > 'There will be no estoppel unless it appears that the matter relied upon as > a defence in the second action was so relevant to the subject matter of the > first action that it would have been unreasonable not to rely on it. > Generally speaking, it would be unreasonable not to plead a defence if, > having regard to the nature of the plaintiff's claim, and its subject matter > it would be expected that the defendant would raise the defence and thereby > enable the relevant issues to be determined in the one proceeding.

Port of > Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589, at para.37 The test was then stated as being: > '... the likelihood that the omission to plead a defence will contribute to > the existence of conflicting judgments is obviously an important factor to > be taken into account in deciding whether the omission to plead can found an > estoppel against the assertion of the same matter as a foundation for a > cause of action in a second proceeding.

The position in most common law jurisdictions (which follow England) is that if an issue is not barred by a finding of 'cause of action estoppel', or 'issue estoppel', the question then turns to whether an abuse of process can be established on the Henderson v Henderson line of authority.Footnote 40, at page 11 Nazzini, Renato, Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards: Res Judicata, Issue Estoppel, and Abuse of Process in a Transnational Context (June 12, 2018). American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 20, 2018, King's College London Law School Research Paper No. 2018-32, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3249060 , Some commentators have characterised Australia's position as an extension of issue estoppel jurisprudence. Similar extensions exist in Canada. The nature of Anshun estoppel as a doctrine has often been the subject of High Court proceedings. Complexities have arisen as to; the rule's application in group proceedings (such as class actions), and its relationship with abuse of process.

Flora and fauna  The vegetation of the ecoregion is predominantly thornbush meadows and alphine grasslands. 72% of the ground in the ecoregion is herbaceous cover or shrubs; the remainder is bare ground. The habitat is considered vulnerable due to livestock grazing and diversion of water sources. Over 190 species of vertebrates have been recorded in the ecoregion. Only one, however, is endemic - the endangered Afghan brook salamander, which may have a range of less than 10 square kilometers, and number fewer than 2,000 individuals. Birds of conservation interest include the near-threatened Cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), the vulnerable Pale-backed pigeon (Columba eversmanni), and the endangered Rufous backed bunting (Emberiza jankowskii).

Matilda′s father Henry was a prominent noble from the House of Vianden, while her mother Margaret was daughter of Peter Courtenay (d. 1219), Latin Emperor of Constantinople. Margaret′s brothers, consequent Latin emperors Robert (d. 1228) and Baldwin II (d. 1273), were Matilda′s maternal uncles. Matilda was married (c. 1235) to John Angelos, Lord of Syrmia in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. John was son of Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos (d. 1204) and Princess Margaret of Hungary. John died before 1253, and Matilda became the Lady of Požega in medieval Požega County (central region in modern Slavonia). Their daughter Maria was married (c. 1253-1255) to Anselm de Cayeux, who later (before 1269) became camerlengo of the Latin Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople, Maria′s great-uncle. Various issues regarding the attribution of data related to two persons (father and son) who had the same name (Anselm de Cayeux), have been discussed in several genealogical studies, since sources from the 1280s and 1290s suggest that Matilda′s daughter Maria had a sister Helen, Queen of Serbia (d. 1314).

It published 15 issues between 1977 and 1990. Roksi is generally considered to be the first rock music periodical in the Soviet Union.  History  Roksi was established in by Boris Grebenshchikov of Akvarium and Beatles-fanatic Kolya Vasin as a samizdat rock fanzine. Each copy was typewritten, with photographs glued to the pages. In order to comply with Soviet publishing laws at the time, no more than six copies were made of each issue. The editorial committee for the first three issues consisted of Grebenshchikov, Vasin, Mike Naumenko of Zoopark, photographer Natasha Vasil'eva, and Yuri Il'chenko of Mify and Mashina Vremeni, with Grebenshchikov as editor-in-chief. The first three issues came out in October 1977, January 1978, and autumn 1978. Aleksandr Startsev served as Roksi's chief editor from 1984 to 1990. Starting in January 1985, Roksi became officially associated with the Leningrad Rock Club and increased its circulation to 50 copies per issue.  Content  Roksi featured coverage of both Anglo-American and Soviet rock music. Features included editorials, rumor columns, the 'Lengortop' hit parade, interviews with musicians, and translated articles from Western sources, such as Rolling Stone.

He is a Professor, Director of China Center for Economic Research and Dean of National School of Development at Beijing University. He is the Executive Director of Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development and is an Editor of China Economic Quarterly. Yao is also appointed by Ministry of Education as Cheung-Kong Scholar Chair Professor. Yao’s research is primarily focused on economic development and institutional change in China. He has published over 100 research papers and is the author or co-author of books including China’s Private enterprise, Economic Reform and Institutional Innovation and CSR and Competitiveness in China, among others. Yao is the recipient of several awards such as Sun Yefang Economic Science Award and Pu Shan Award. He is a member of China Economists 50 Forum and is a Richard von Weizsäcker Fellow at Robert Bosch Foundation.  Education  Yao received his Bachelor’s degree in Geography and his Master’s degree in Economics from Peking University in 1986 and 1989, respectively. In 1996, he completed his Ph.D. studies in Agricultural and Applied Economics from University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Career  After the completion of his Ph.D., Yao joined Peking University’s China Center for Economic Research as an Assistant Professor. In 1999, he was promoted to Associate Professor and to a Professor in 2002. Yao has also held administrative appointments along with academic appointments. In 2006, he served a five-year term as the Director of Management Committee at the Institute for Social Science Survey. Yao was appointed, by the Peking University, as the Director of China Center for Economic Research in 2010 and as Dean of the National School of Development in 2012. He took up a position of Executive Director at the Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development in 2016. Yao has also taught as a visiting faculty at several universities including International University of Japan, Stanford University, New York University and University of Washington. He taught as a Visiting Professor at Aichi University and University of Melbourne during the 2010s. He was a Visiting Scholar at the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition in 2015. Yao often writes in various magazines and newspapers including The Economist, China Daily, Project Syndicate and Financial Times. He has also been involved with several public projects having a global impact. In late 2019, Yao, along with Jeffrey Lehman and Dani Rodrik, co-convened a ‘US-China Trade Policy Working Group’ to devise possible solutions for the US- China trade relationship. Yao and the working group issued a joint statement and proposed a new way forward to resolve the trade conflicts between USA and China.  Research  Yao has conducted extensive research on the development economics, political economy and institutional change in China. His early research includes his study on political processes and the institutional change. He presented an impossibility result for the efficiency hypothesis of institutional change in a general economic setting and a well behaved political process. By combining the social choice literature with the institutional literature, he studied the formative role of political processes in institutional changes. Yao’s main institutional research focused on China’s economic transformation since 1978. He explained the contemporary concepts regarding institutional changes and then presented the alternative approach to these concepts. Yao explained the general model of China’s institutional transition, and proposed a formal model of institutional change involving ideological evolution and actual actions of change. He also explained the two phases of institutional changes. Yao researched about the informal institutions, collective action, and public investment in rural China and investigated the influence of lineage groups on the expenditure of local public goods. He used data from over 200 Chinese villages and found that leaders from two largest family clans in a village contributed to the local public investment and that these leaders were supported by their clans in financing the public goods. Yao directed his research focus on political economy in the early 2000s. He authored an article about the political equality, coalition formation, and economic performance in autocracies; and explained the economic performance in an autocratic government using theory of endogenous coalition formation. He highlighted the role of social revolution in the sustainable growth of a country. Yao discussed the high performing countries after the World War II and how the revolutions in those countries led to the uprooting of old socio-political structures of agrarian economy and the establishment of a social culture that supported political equality and industrial growth. He investigated the effect of pre-tenure experience on the performance of national executives. According to Yao, the political experience gained by national executives influenced their human capital and personal power and led to competent economic governance. His cross-country research indicated a positive associated between economic growth and the pre-tenure political experience gained by national executives. Along with political economy, Yao also focused on the governmental and economic growth. He conducted a study on rural China and investigated the influence of village elections on state taxation, fiscal sharing and the general accountably of village committee. His research indicated that elections led to an improvement in the accountability of village committee but had a negative impact on the local fiscal sharing of the village. Yao studied China’s economic success in shifting its economic system from planned economy to market-based system during the Reform Era. He investigated the various strategies and decisions China undertook about the economic policies. Yao pointed to the role of government as a disinterested party as the main reason for China’s economic success. He also discussed the possible reasons for the disinterested approach of Chinese government. Yao’s research also placed a positive role of education on economic liberalization. He emphasized upon the role of educational background in forming ideas and beliefs of political leaders, which then impacted their decisions about economic policies. He conducted a cross-country research and found a positive association between a leader’s educational background and a better implementation of liberal reforms. Yao conducted research on the political participation of women and the gender gaps of education in China. He studied women political participation by measuring the female membership in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). His study indicated that female political involvement in the 1950s contributed to a significant decrease in the gender education gap of the 1990s. It was found that the positive effects from female political participation can be obtained by influencing the gender perception of general population. In response to the criticism on China’s political system in the face of Covid-19 and its initial slow response in the recognition of virus, Yao authored an article interpreting China’s political system and compared it with the Confucian state. According to him, governance based on Confucian teachings is in accordance with Chinese traditions and the psychological inclination of Chinese natives. Yao also discussed China’s political system in the face of pandemic and presented suggestions for the implementation of checks and balances in China.

It is the second in Muir's Locked Tomb trilogy, preceded by Gideon the Ninth (2019). Plot After ascending to Lyctorhood in Gideon the Ninth, Harrowhark \\"Harrow\\" Nonagesimus discovers that her process of ascension is somehow imperfect and she lacks many of a Lyctor's standard powers, in addition to secretly having hallucinations of a beautiful woman she refers to as ”the Body.” Despite this, the Emperor fulfills his promise and renews her House by waking several hundred people lying in wait since the Resurrection. He apologizes that she does not have a real choice in returning to her House because the Lyctors are perpetually being chased by Resurrection Beasts, the ‘ghosts’ of the dead planets of the Nine Houses. In addition, large portions of Harrow’s memory are missing; Ianthe Tridentarius gives her a series of letters written by Harrow herself, giving her detailed instructions for what to do or avoid doing in various scenarios. Ianthe appears to know the reason behind these letters but has been hexed by this past Harrow to prevent her from any talk of it. The book alternates between two perspectives; second- person chapters documenting Harrow's experiences in the present as a Lyctor, and third-person chapters that take place in the past, documenting Harrow's memories of the events in Canaan House in Gideon the Ninth. However, her memories of Canaan House directly contradict the events of Gideon, including replacing Gideon herself with Ortus, who is extremely occupied with his telling of an epic poem called The Noniad, as her cavalier. In this version, Harrow reveals to Ortus that she is insane and frequently reads text that appears differently to other characters. Teacher informs that there is a beast lying in the heart of the facility called “the Sleeper,” who takes out a different cast of characters than previously died at Canaan House in Gideon. In the present day, John, the Emperor of the Nine Houses, explains the nature of his secret war to her: ten thousand years ago, humanity was wiped out by an unknown cataclysm. John resurrected the entire population of humankind with impossibly powerful magic, but the nature of necromancy caused this action to spawn revenant Resurrection Beasts. John and his Lyctors have been fighting the Resurrection Beasts for millennia; most of the Lyctors have been lost to madness or in battle with the Beasts. The surviving Lyctors are Mercymorn, the 'Saint of Joy', a vicious and embittered woman; Augustine, the 'Saint of Patience', who is flippant and outrageous to hide what seems to be a deadened, ruthless manner; and Ortus, the stoic, relentless 'Saint of Duty'. These three, along with John, tutor Harrowhark and Ianthe in an extremely dangerous art: the ability to travel to an otherworldly afterlife called The River where they can defeat the Resurrection Beasts by destroying their astral bodies. This travel involves a Lyctor’s soul metaphysically entering the River and letting their consumed cavalier’s soul enter their body in the physical realm in order to defend them while their bodies are vulnerable. Harrow’s faulty ascension leaves her unable to do this successfully and so is of limited use in their war. Similarly, Ianthe has difficulty letting Naberius take over. John also alludes that the Empire is under attack by a terrorist organization called 'Blood of Eden', which seeks to foil the Empire's colonialist ambitions, led by the mysterious Commander Wake. Eventually, Harrow encounters Camilla Hect, the cavalier to Palamedes Sextus, believed dead after the events at Canaan House. Camilla is working for Blood of Eden, and helps Harrow learn that Palamedes is not truly dead; his spirit is sequestered in a tiny pocket dimension inside the River. In the present, the battle with the nearest Resurrection Beast is about to begin. In the past, Harrow learns that this Canaan House is not real - instead it is a similar 'pocket' in the ether sustained by beliefs and memories; everyone in the House other than Harrow is, in truth, dead. The survivors make a last-ditch attempt to fight the Sleeper by casting a spell to summon the spirit of Matthias Nonius, the greatest swordsman in the history of the Ninth House. Matthias's ghost fights the Sleeper to a standstill, energized by Ortus's intense dedication to his legend. In the present, Gideon awakens in Harrow's body, revealing that the second person perspective was not stylistic but in fact literal, portraying Gideon's observation of Harrow's actions from her own point of view, while in the 'past', Harrow's perspective was her own. It is revealed that Harrow's memory loss and seemingly defective Lyctorhood was caused by Harrow and Ianthe performing brain surgery on Harrow to destroy all memories of Gideon. This ensured that Gideon's soul was never truly absorbed by Harrow and she would continue to exist; Harrow loved her too much to allow her to permanently die. In the present, the corpse of Cytherea the First is possessed by the ghost of Commander Wake. The surviving Lyctors' attempt to murder John, who they blame for the deaths of their cavaliers and comrades in ages past. They learn that Gideon was born as a result of Wake artificially inseminating herself with semen stolen from John, making them, in effect, Gideon's parents. Gideon was created to breach the Locked Tomb on the Ninth House and release the prisoner inside. This prisoner is explained to be Alecto, John's cavalier, whose life was used to give John his limitless necromancy powers while preserving her life. They have sworn revenge on John for never sharing this technique and letting their cavaliers die needlessly. Mercymorn destroys John's body, but he survives and kills her. He then sheds his affable persona and demands the remaining Lyctors' fealty. Augustine declines, vowing to fight and die, and throws John into the River in an attempt to kill him permanently. In Harrow's constructed version of the past, they kill the Sleeper - unmasked as a projection of the ghost of Commander Wake - with the help of Matthias Nonius. Harrow starts to regain her memories as everyone but her comes to accept that they are all ghosts. They tell Harrow to return to her life and resolve to follow Matthias into the River and face the Resurrection Beast. As the two perspectives converge in the present, Ianthe chooses to side with the Emperor and helps him kill Augustine. The Resurrection Beast is repelled by Matthias and the ghosts, but Harrow's consciousness is either unwilling or unable to return to life. Still in a vision of the Locked Tomb where she first met the Body, she climbs into the Body's empty coffin and falls unconscious again. Six months in the future, an unknown person awakens in an apartment in an unnamed city with Camilla Hect.  Reception  Constance Grady of Vox writes that Harrow the Ninth is \\"delightfully, beautifully weird, a book even odder than its predecessor but just as bewitching.\\" Calling the book \\"gorgeously Baroque,\\" Jason Sheehan of NPR writes that it was \\"so beautifully, wildly and precariously weird that I couldn't help sliding through page after page, rolling around blood-drunk in the mess of it all.\\" The Library Journal, Publishers Weekly, and Booklist also gave the book positive reviews, as did authors Alix Harrow, Django Wexler, Kiersten White, and Rebecca Roanhorse. Several reviewers commented on the book's unusual narrative complexity. Liz Bourke of Locus wrote that its \\"constant shifts of time and perspective, and the unreliability of its narrator, mean that it never quite attains a coherent narrative through-line or a thematic argument that a reader can get their teeth into.\\" Others were more positive, taking this as a conscious stylistic choice on Muir's part: Sheehan called it \\"wickedly challenging to read, deliberately impossible to comprehend in full\\". Grady's review concludes \\"as bewildered as I am at times by Harrow the Ninth, I always enjoy being bewildered by Muir.\\"  References  Category:21st-century New Zealand novels Category:Science fantasy novels Category:2020 science fiction novels Category:LGBT speculative fiction novels ","title":"Harrow the Ninth"},{"id":"65395540","text":"Sisir Ghosh is an former Indian professional footballer who played as a striker for local Kolkata clubs Mohun Bagan and East Bengal.

Arthur Tree, son of the American lawyer and diplomat, Lambert Tree, and his wife, the Marshall Field's heiress, had moved to England in the later 19th century and established themselves as country gentry. They purchased the Ashorne estate in 1892 and Goldie was commissioned to build a new house in the Arts & Crafts style. The house, now a management training college, is a Grade II listed building. History Arthur and Ethel Tree formed part of a group of Americans who emigrated to England in the late 19th century. Fiske Kimball, an architect and director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art described \\"the traditional country house of England [as] the perfection of human society\\", and a number of wealthy Americans determined to buy or build their own perfections in England. The group's foremost member, William Waldorf Astor had declared that America was \\"no longer a fit place for a gentleman to live\\" and had moved himself, his family, and his $100M fortune to England in 1891. Astor set himself up as a country gentleman at Hever Castle in Kent, and the Trees followed his example at Ashorne Hill. They employed Edward Goldie to design the house which was constructed between 1895 and 1897. Their marriage did not long outlast their purchase of the estate – Ethel's affair with David Beatty led to their separation in 1899 and divorce in 1901. Arthur remained with their children at Ashorne, and established a second family with their governess, Kathleen Walch, with whom he remained in an unmarried partnership until his death in 1914. One of Arthur and Ethel's children was Ronald Tree, who married Nancy Lancaster, the interior designer. The house was later owned by the Bryant family, of Bryant & May matchmakers, before being sold in the 1930s to the British Iron & Steel Corporation for use as their corporate headquarters. During the Second World War over 600 technical staff worked in secret at the house on metallurgic investigations to support Britain’s war effort. They were housed in Tree's stables, which were constructed in 1897 and bear his initials in a datestone on the interior courtyard wall. At this time Ashorne, described as “the Bletchley Park of the steel industry”, was managed by Major John Howard Alexander, the inventor of the spear-point pump, used in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. The house is now a management training college. Architecture and description Nikolaus Pevsner, in his Buildings of England volume, Warwickshire, described Ashorne as \\"clearly on the way to the Lutyens style\\", while Chris Pickford, in the revised 2016 edition, sees comparisons with \\"contemporary American mansions on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley\\". Historic England describes the style as \\"a good example of late 19th century Arts and Crafts architecture\\". Edward Goldie was primarily an ecclesiastical architect and Ashorne Hill is a rare example of his extending his practice into domestic architecture. The layout of the house follows a neo-Elizabethan E-plan, with a recessed entrance porch and two projecting wings. The interior is decorated in a medley of opulent styles; Pickford and Pevsner record the “Neo-Jacobean galleried hall, classical drawing room and Rococo boudoir“. Historic England notes that the large overmantel above the fireplace in the great hall was originally decorated with plaster reliefs of a \\"tree, figures, portrait busts etc.\\" but these have now been eradicated. Ashorne Hill is a Grade II listed building. The balustrade on the terrace that runs along the south, garden, frontage of the house, and which dates from 1901, has its own Grade II listing.

It was set up in 2003 by the photographer and painter Cartier-Bresson, his wife, also a photographer, Franck, and their daughter, Mélanie Cartier-Bresson. The Foundation hosts four solo exhibitions per year by a variety of photographers, painters, sculptors, and illustrators, and a changing exhibition of Cartier- Bresson's own work all the time. Agnès Sire is its artistic director and François Hébel its director. Mission The Foundation's mission is to preserve the archives of Henri Cartier-Bresson and Martine Franck, and show their work and the work of others. It also exists to help researchers and curators to work with those archives. Exhibitions The Foundation hosts four solo exhibitions per year by a variety of photographers, painters, sculptors, and illustrators, and a changing exhibition of Cartier-Bresson's own work all the time. The inaugural exhibition at the Rue des Archives venue, in November 2018, was Martine Franck – A Retrospective, which then toured to Musée de l'Élysée in Switzerland, and Fotomuseum Antwerp in Belgium. Archive Cartier-Bresson and Franck's archives consist of over 50,000 prints and 200,000 negatives, as well as all kinds of documents. Prior to 2018, the archives were scattered over four sites, but since then they have all been housed in the new building. History The Foundation was set up by Cartier-Bresson, Franck and Mélanie Cartier-Bresson. Cartier-Bresson gave his personal collection of his photographs to the Foundation. It opened in 2003 in a renovated 19th-century building at 2 Impasse Lebouis in the Montparnasse district of Paris. Between 2003 and 2018 it had 100,000 visitors a year. The Foundation's former building at Impasse Lebouis In November 2018 it moved to 79 Rue des Archives, in the Marais district of Paris; a tall, narrow atelier in a 1913 building. The new building has significantly more exhibition and archive space than the previous, allowing for four exhibitions a year instead of three. The new venue also allows, for the first time, to have Cartier- Bresson's own work always on display. Organisation The non-profit Foundation is privately funded. A proportion of funds come from an endowment left by Franck, who died in 2012. From 2003 Agnès Sire was its director. In November 2017 Sire became artistic director and François Hébel was appointed as director. HCB Award The Foundation issues the HCB Award.

It is a typical dish for a traditional Christmas Eve or .; Limpa bread pairs well with jams and jellies, or cream cheese. Preparation Swedish flag for National Day of Sweden 2007 The first step for making the bread is to bring molasses, brown sugar, caraway seeds, and water to a gentle boil, then to add shortening or butter and citrus rind. Once this mixture has cooled to a lukewarm temperature it is combined with activated yeast and rye flour. The dough rises and more flour is added to knead the dough in preparation for a second rise, then the tops are brushed with melted butter and the loaves are baked. Some recipes add the molasses mixture to the dry ingredients after the rye flour has been scalded with hot water. Ingredients Historically, this bread was leavened with fermented brewer's wort, so it can also be called vörtlimpa (\\"wort loaf\\"). Modern recipes do sometimes still use stout beer as an ingredient.

The workers, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, went on strike on August 10, 2018, with the strike ending later that day. Several days later, the union and company reached an agreement on new labor contracts.  Background  On August 5, 2018, 120 members of Local 728 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters voted to authorize strike action against their employer, Republic Services. The workers involved were part of a unit that serviced several residential areas in Atlanta, as well as the Atlanta Public Schools, Emory Healthcare, Emory University, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Piedmont Hospital. The strike organizer claimed that the members voted to strike after disputes in labor contract negotiations with Republic, saying, “The company has halted bargaining and negotiating with these workers. They refuse to reduce employees’ cost of health insurance. Workers don’t get paid for all the time they work.” Additionally, the union alleged that Republic was guilty of violating Federal law in an incident where work was taken from full-time mechanics and leased to subcontractors. A previous strike involving workers for Republic occurred in 2013 in nearby McDonough, Georgia.  Course of the strike  The strike began shortly after midnight on August 10, when the workers performed a walkout. Shortly thereafter, the strikers, many wearing yellow vests, began picketing outside Republic's Atlanta offices. The strike ended later that day at 3:30 p.m., though there are disagreements regarding how the strike ended. In a press release, Republic claimed that union officials had \\"directed our employees to walk out on their jobs this morning without giving our employees a chance to vote on our comprehensive proposal,\\" and they had \\"accepted an immediate and unconditional offer by Teamsters 728 to return to work.” However, the strike organizer claimed that the strike had ended when it was scheduled to end, with no conversation occurring between Republic and union members. Following the end of the strike, the strike organizer didn't rule out the possibility of subsequent strike action. Republic claimed that the impact of the strike on their operations were minimal, only affecting some operations in the southern part of the city.  Aftermath  Following the strike, none of the striking employees faced disciplinary action from the company. Several days later, on August 27, the union and company reached an agreement on a new 5-year labor contract.

Clermont-Ganneau présente à l'Académie les deux stèles de Nerab, qu'il a réussi , après de longues et difficiles négociations, à acquérir pour le compte de la Commission du Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum et qui sont destinées à entrer prochainement au Musée du Louvre. Ce sont deux monuments d'une haute valeur pour l'archéologie orientale, en même temps que deux pages précieuses pour l'épigraphie sémitique. Ils proviennent des environs immédiats d'Alep , d'un petit village arabe qui a encore conservé le nom antique de la localité, Nerab, qui apparaît déjà dans la liste des conquêtes de Touthmès III en Syrie.\\" The steles are made of black basalt, and the inscriptions note that they were funerary steles. Discovery On 11 November 1891, Adrien Barthélemy, then dragoman at France's Aleppo consulate, wrote to Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, with information provided to him by the Franciscan priest R.P. Paul de Saint-Aignan (Simoneau) as follows: > “Very recently, workers repairing terraces, on a hillock in the village of > Nerab near Aleppo, unearthed a stone representing an offering underneath > which is a Phoenician inscription. I did not see the subject, but I saw a > stamping of the inscription made by a French cleric\\".Fauveaud-Brassaud, > Lozachmeur (2013): \\"Tout récemment des ouvriers prenant de la terre pour > refaire les terrasses, sur un monticule au village de Nérab près d’Alep, ont > mis au jour une pierre représentant une offrande au-dessous de laquelle est > une inscription phénicienne. Je n’ai pas vu le sujet mais j’ai eu sous les > yeux un estampage de l’inscription fait par un religieux français\\" Clermont-Ganneau wrote to Ernest Renan, who was still in charge of the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum, who replied that the \\"mouth watering\\" letter may well be referring to an Aramaic counterpart to a stele found shortly before by the German excavators at Sam'al.Fauveaud-Brassaud, Lozachmeur (2013): \\"La lettre de M. Barthélemy fait vraiment venir de l’eau à la bouche. Il semble que ce doit être un pendant de l’inscription de Zingirli, probablement en araméen. Il est capital que nous l’ayons\\" This enthusiasm dampened after German expert Julius Euting questioned the authenticity of the steles after having reviewed a squeeze.Fauveaud-Brassaud, Lozachmeur (2013): \\"Un estampage aurait été envoyé en Allemagne, à un professeur de Dusseldorf \\"un vulgaire collectionneur d’estampages épigraphiques\\", qui sera bientôt identifié comme \\"Herr Euting, le professeur d'Outre Rhin\\". Mais rapidement le risque d'une concurrence de l'Allemagne s'éloigne car Euting déclare que les inscriptions sont une \\"falsification inouïe [...] qu’elles ont été gravées par un lapidaire juif, habile et connaissant bien l’hébreu\\". La rumeur tempère du coup l'ardeur des Français qui doivent se montrer plus circonspects. Clermont-Ganneau parle de \\"monuments décidément très suspects\\".\\" The steles were purchased from the landowner by Nicolas Marcopoli, a notable Aleppo merchant family (for whom the Souq Marcopoli is named). Marcopoli offered the steles to Léon Heuzey at the Louvre for 10,000 Francs; Heuzey, who was at the time focused on the excavations at Girsu in Mesopotamia, turned down the offer. Clermont-Ganneau resolved to acquire the steles himself, which he did via two-year-long negotiations led by the Franciscan brothers and the French Consulate. In 1894 he successfully acquired the steles for 2,000 Francs, with funds from the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres; the reduced price was due to the doubts about authenticity. The steles were then transported to Paris over land, in a two-year journey, and acquired by the Louvre in January 1897 for 2,500 Francs.Fauveaud-Brassaud, Lozachmeur (2013): \\"Les monuments découverts par hasard, lors de travaux de terrassement, ont été achetés au propriétaire du terrain par Nicolas Marcopoli, marchand « levantin » établi à Alep avec sa famille et sont entreposés à son domicile... Nouveaux estampages et moulages sont maintenant indispensables, d'autant plus que la somme de 10 000 Francs, demandée par les vendeurs, est très élevée. Une fois l'authenticité établie, ils espèrent une acquisition par le musée du Louvre. Mais, entre temps, Clermont-Ganneau apprend que Léon Heuzey, conservateur du département des Antiquités orientales à qui Marcopoli a déjà écrit pour lui proposer lesdits monuments, n'a pas l'intention de donner suite: \\"J'avais dit un mot de la chose à M. Heuzey qui l'avait accueilli assez froidement, tout préoccupé qu’il est en ce moment des fouilles de M. de Sarzec et du désir de ne pas indisposer Hamdi Bey\\". Devant l’indifférence qu’affiche le musée du Louvre, la commission du CIS, sous la tutelle de l'Académie des Inscriptions, décide de négocier directement avec la famille Marcopoli... Elles sont pilotées depuis Paris par Clermont-Ganneau et conduites sur place par les Franciscains, frère Paul, puis frère Prosper Marie , et, dans une moindre mesure, par Barthélemy, représentant le consulat d'Alep. Démarches et contre-démarches se succèdent pendant plus de deux ans, avec toujours en arrière-plan, les concurrences allemande et anglaise. Il est question de faire venir à Paris les stèles pour les examiner, mais cette demande ne reçoit pas d’emblée l’assentiment des marchands et donne lieu à diverses propositions dont aucune n’est satisfaisante aux yeux de Clermont-Ganneau. Les tractations se concluent enfin par un accord : vente ferme sur place pour la somme de 2 000 francs, sur les fonds de l'Académie (fondation Piot), versée directement à l'antiquaire par les frères Franciscains qui sont présentés comme les acquéreurs officiels. Finalement, les doutes sur l'authenticité des stèles, en décourageant les éventuels concurrents, ont servi les intérêts français et divisé par cinq le prix initialement demandé par les Marcopoli. Le 11 juin 1894, les stèles sont déposées à la chancellerie du consulat d'Alep. Barthélemy est chargé du transport des monuments. La discrétion la plus absolue sur et l'opération prendra presque deux ans avec le trajet par terre , puis l'embarquement sur un bateau en direction de Paris, via Marseille cette entreprise est de rigueur jusqu'à Beyrouth probablement. Une véritable épopée... Un an plus tard le Comité consultatif des Musées nationaux, en sa séance du 7 janvier 1897, vote l’acquisition des stèles pour la somme de 2 500 francs.\\" References Bibliography * Clermont-Ganneau Charles.

Film rights for the novel have been optioned by Temple Hill Entertainment. Synopsis The novel centers upon Quinn, a teenage girl who has recently moved to the small factory town of Kettle Springs, Missouri after the tragic death of her mother. Her father has been hired as the new town physician in the hopes that this will allow the two of them to heal. The area has suffered financially since the closing of the Baypen Corn Syrup Factory and its subsequent burning due to arson. As a result the town is at odds with itself and strict lines are drawn between the largely conservative adults and the teens, who are more interested in having fun and drawing views on social media. Quinn manages to befriend some of the other teens after an incident during her first day in class, after one of the teachers sends them all to study hall. She is invited to attend the Founder's Day celebration with them despite the teacher also banning them from the event. However things take a turn for the worst when the town's mascot, Frendo the Clown, begins to kill the town's \\"wayward\\" youth one by one.  Development  When writing the novel Cesare wanted to \\"do not so much a throwback slasher as an attempt at a modern slasher with modern themes.\\"  Release  Clown in a Cornfield was released in the United States in hardback and ebook format on August 25, 2020 through HarperTeen. An audiobook adaptation narrated by Jesse Vilinsky was released on the same day through HarperCollins. Reception Clown in a Cornfield has been reviewed by outlets such as Locus Magazine and the Library Journal, the latter of which stated that \\"While this title is marketed to teens, adult readers familiar with the classic horror slasher movies of the 1980s and 1990s should find it appeals.\\" Signal Horizon and Bad Feeling Magazine also reviewed the novel, both praising Cesare for his writing.

The white-washed, sugarloaf-shaped folly was erected in 1817 for John Gaskell Junior of North End Farm, as a monument to the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. The structure was built of rendered sandstone rubble. The entrance is now blocked but inside is a room with and a circular stone table surrounded by a curved stone bench.

The reserve is a species-rich grassland with an abundance of native wildflowers including betony, devils-bit scabious and knapweed. This grassland habitat attracts pollinators such as bumblebees and 10 butterfly species, including small heath, wall brown and small skipper. Blackcap, chiffchaff and tawny owls are among the birds which inhabit the reserve. In autumn the rare waxcap mushroom spreads through the grass sward.

Background There were many troubles for Jai Singh II when he was the governor of Malwa, in order to deal with the turbulent bands of marauders, Jai Singh had maintained an army of 10,000 soldiers, which included the clansmen of Budh Singh Hada and Chatrasal Bundela. The army was well equipped and included a contingent of musketeers and artillery. In 1715 Jai Singh expelled the Maratha raider called Ganga and then marched towards Sironj, where he defeated the Afghans. The Afghans under Dilir Khan called the Maratha's for help against Jai Singh II. The Jaipur raja upon getting to know about the large host of Marathas that were approaching, quickly attacked Dilir. On 2nd April, he attacked the Afghan army of 12,000 men and defeated them. 2000 Afghans were killed in battle while the Jaipur army lost 500 men. Jai Singh then turned towards the Afghan camp in Bhilsa and devastated it. Battle It was at this time that reports started coming about two large Maratha armies that had entered Malwa. Kanhoji Bhonsle and Khande Rao Dabhade with an army of 42,000 men had crossed the Narmada river on 1st-2nd of April and had made their camps at Tilwara. they pillaged within 4 miles of the provincial capital and looted and burnt the city of Depalpur. On 5th April the Maratha’s sent an army of 12,000 horsemen to Barwah and they marched around Indore and demanded chauth from the province of Kampel. Upon knowing of these developments, Jai Singh quickly marched towards Ujjain and sent his deputy to secure his capital. On 8th May, the Jaipur Raja moved towards the Marathas, while the Maratha commanders, Kanho and Ganga were deciding on how to cross Narmada with all the loot they had collected. Jai Singh force marched towards them crossing 38 miles and arrived before the Maratha camp on 10th May. The Marathas upon seeing the small Jaipur army became confident upon their numbers and advanced to fight them. The travel- worn Rajputs also advanced, Budh Singh Hada, Chatrasal Bundela, Dhiraj Singh Khichi and several minor Jagirdars were under the command of Jai Singh II. After a fight of four hours, the Maratha's broke and started fleeing. The Marathas fled six-miles away from the field of battle into the mountains of Palsud and were confidently marching in the mountanious region, thinking that they had escaped. However Jai Singh chased them the whole night and caught up to them on 11th May. Upon seeing the Jaipur army, the Maratha's fled to the Narmada river and left all of their loot. Aftermath The Maratha army were forced to leave two months worth of loot, that they had acquired from Malwa and Khandesh. Jai allowed his men to keep the spoils of war. “everyone gained booty enough to feed him for years”. The emperor praised Jai Singh for his achievement and the local jagirdars confessed that no imperial officer had inflicted such a great victory in Malwa against the Marathas.

He is the only pilot to have successfully thwarted an in-flight hijacking. Bar-Lev was born on an Israeli moshav. He was a 16 year-old soldier during Israel’s War of Independence in 1948 and then became an Israeli Air Force pilot. His last military flight was in 1956 Sinai War, after which he became a pilot for Israel’s national airline El Al. El Al Flight 219 On September 6, 1970, Bar-Lev was the pilot of El Al Flight 219 from Tel Aviv to New York via Amsterdam. He was made aware that four suspicious people were trying to board the plane. Bar-Lev insisted that two of the suspects not be allowed to board, and the two others be questioned. He also asked that the air-marshal be seated with him in the cockpit during the flight. Once the hijackers, Patrick Argüello and Leila Khaled, threatened the crew and passengers, Bar-Lev took control of the flight and threw the plane into a dive. This lowered the plane’s altitude making any explosion or damage less dangerous and knocked the hijackers to the ground. The air marshal killed Arguello and Khaled was arrested after passing out as a result of the dramatic shift in air pressure. She wrote in her memoir that she was forcefully subdued, but that was never the case. Flight 219 was the fifth flight hijacked in that one week of September 1970. Israeli air command told Bar-Lev to fly the plane to Tel Aviv, but he was concerned for the welfare of an injured flight attendant, and the two air marshals, and instead brought the plane to London. Bar-Lev and the crew were detained for hours, questioned by the British police. He was later sanctioned for this decision as well as the decision to have the air marshal fly in the cockpit with him. Bar-Lev and the crew were celebrated by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in December 1970. Retirement and later life In 1974, Bar-Lev retired as a pilot. He lives in Israel with his wife, Yona. Bar-Lev was instrumental in cancelling a 2020 San Francisco State University event with Leila Khaled, one of the 1970 hijackers, arguing that it crossed a line between free speech and inciting terrorism.

The standard Chinese term translated as \\"concubine\\" was qiè , a term that has been used since ancient times, which means \\"concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference)\\". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines () were of lower status, and their children were considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as pínfēi (), or \\"consorts of emperors\\", an official position often carrying a very high rank.Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): Women and the Family in Chinese History. Oxford: Routledge, p. 39. In premodern China it was illegal and socially disreputable for a man to have more than one wife at a time, but it was acceptable to have concubines.Ebrey 2002:39. From the earliest times wealthy men purchased concubines and added them to their household in addition to their wife. The purchase of concubine was similar to the purchase of a slave, yet concubines had a higher social status. In the earliest records a man could have as many concubines as he could afford to purchase. From the Eastern Han period (AD 25–220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law. The higher rank and the more noble identity a man possessed, the more concubines he was permitted to have.Shi Fengyi 史凤仪 (1987): Zhongguo gudai hunyin yu jiating 中国古代婚姻与家庭 Marriage and Family in Ancient China. Wuhan: Hubei Renmin Chubanshe, p. 74. A concubine's treatment and situation was variable and was influenced by the social status of the male to whom she was attached, as well as the attitude of his wife. In the Book of Rites chapter on \\"The Pattern of the Family\\" () it says, \\"If there were betrothal rites, she became a wife; and if she went without these, a concubine.\\" Wives brought a dowry to a relationship, but concubines did not. A concubinage relationship could be entered into without the ceremonies used in marriages, and neither remarriage nor a return to her natal home in widowhood were allowed to a concubine.Ebrey 2002: 60. The position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to a wife's children, although they were of higher status than illegitimate children. The child of a concubine had to show filial duty to two women, their biological mother and their legal mother—the wife of their father.Ebrey 2002: 54. After the death of a concubine, her sons would make an offering to her, but these offerings were not continued by the concubine's grandsons, who only made offerings to their grandfather's wife.Ebrey 2002: 42. There are early records of concubines allegedly being buried alive with their masters to \\"keep them company in the afterlife\\". Until the Song dynasty (960–1276), it was considered a serious breach of social ethics to promote a concubine to a wife. During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the status of concubines improved. It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine- mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers. Many of the concubines of the emperor of the Qing dynasty were freeborn women from prominent families. Concubines of men of lower social status could be either freeborn or slave. Imperial concubines, kept by emperors in the Forbidden City, had different ranks and were traditionally guarded by eunuchs to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor. In Ming China (1368–1644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16. Virtues, behavior, character, appearance and body condition were the selection criteria.Qiu Zhonglin(Chung- lin Ch'iu)邱仲麟:\\"Mingdai linxuan Houfei jiqi guizhi\\" 明代遴選後妃及其規制 (The Imperial Concubine Selection System during the Ming Dynasty). Mingdai Yanjiu 明代研究 (Ming Studies) 11.2008:58. Despite the limitations imposed on Chinese concubines, there are several examples in history and literature of concubines who achieved great power and influence. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as Empress Dowager Cixi, was arguably one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to Xianfeng Emperor and gave birth to his only surviving son, who later became Tongzhi Emperor. She eventually became the de facto ruler of Qing China for 47 years after her husband's death. An examination of concubinage features in one of the Four Great Classical Novels, Dream of the Red Chamber (believed to be a semi- autobiographical account of author Cao Xueqin's family life). Three generations of the Jia family are supported by one notable concubine of the emperor, Jia Yuanchun, the full elder sister of the male protagonist Jia Baoyu. In contrast, their younger half-siblings by concubine Zhao, Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, develop distorted personalities because they are the children of a concubine. Emperors' concubines and harems are emphasized in 21st-century romantic novels written for female readers and set in ancient times. As a plot element, the children of concubines are depicted with a status much inferior to that in actual history. The zhai dou (，residential intrigue) and gong dou (，harem intrigue) genres show concubines and wives, as well as their children, scheming secretly to gain power. Empresses in the Palace, a gong dou type novel and TV drama, has had great success in 21st-century China. Hong Kong officially abolished the Great Qing Legal Code in 1971, thereby making concubinage illegal. Casino magnate Stanley Ho of Macau took his \\"second wife\\" as his official concubine in 1957, while his \\"third and fourth wives\\" retain no official status. In traditional Chinese marriage Women in concubinage (妾) were treated as inferior, and expected to be subservient to the wife (if there was one).Patrick Fuliang Shan, “Unveiling China’s Relinquished Marital Mode: A Study of Yuan Shikai’s Polygamous Household,” Frontiers of History in China, (Vol. 14, No. 2, July 2019), pp. 185–211; The women were not wedded in a whole formal ceremony, had less right in the relationship, and could be divorced arbitrarily. They generally came from lower social status or were bought as slaves. Women who had eloped may have also become concubines since a formal wedding requires her parents' participation. The number of concubines was sometime regulated, which differs according to the men's rank. In ancient China, men of higher social status often supported several concubines, and Chinese emperors almost always had dozens of, even hundreds of royal concubines. A European painting of an emperor of China inspecting his fantasy fishing fleet with his concubines Despite the limitations imposed on ancient Chinese concubines, history and literature have examples of concubines achieving great power and influence. For example, in one of the Four Great Classical Novels of China, The Dream of the Red Chamber (believed to be a semi-autobiographical account of author Cao Xueqin's own family life), three generations of the Jia family are supported by one favorite concubine of the emperor. Imperial concubines, kept by emperors in the Forbidden City, were traditionally guarded by eunuchs to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as Empress Dowager Cixi, was arguably one of the most successful concubines in China's history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to the Xianfeng Emperor and gave birth to an illegitimate male heir, who would become the Tongzhi Emperor. The emperor passed over many legitimate male heirs and named Cixi's son the crown prince. She would eventually become the de facto ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in China for 47 years after her son's death. A somewhat different form of it is the so-called \\"two primary wives\\" (兩頭大). Traditionally, a married woman is expected to live with her husband's family. When the husband has to live away from his family, however, she has to stay with her in-laws and take care of them. A man who thus suffers chronic separation from his wife, such as a traveling merchant, may \\"marry\\" another woman where he lives and set up a separate household with her. Due to the geographical separation, the second woman often regards herself as a full wife for all practical matters, yet legally this marriage is not recognized, and she is treated as a concubine. In China specifically, in cases where the primary wife fails to have sons to preserve the male lineage, i.e. family name, a secondary wife is allowed by law via the sing-song girls concept. Although modern Chinese law explicitly prohibits polygamy, there has been a recent surge of polygamy in mainland China. Since the opening of China's borders in the 1970s, businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan started setting up \\"secondary wives\\" (二奶, er nai) in the Mainland. Since then the practice has spread to local affluent men. Someone considered as 二奶 would receive more privileges than another woman regarded as 小三 (xiao san), a term reserved for a mere mistress rather than a role more akin to second wife or concubine. Although this practice is condemned throughout society many men still have 二奶 and 小三, which can cause conflict and trauma, just as it would in western countries. Some juries in China consider married people who leave home to live with their lovers to have committed bigamy.China.org.cn criminal law However most law cases filed were before 2000, and the situation does not really differ from that in western countries. People will not get prosecuted for \\"bigamy\\" for out-of-marriage relationships as long as they do not register another marriage, but might be required to cede more possessions in divorce cases involving a former wife.

It is located along the Lahti–Kouvola line, and its neighboring stations are Nastola in the west and Kausala in the east.  History  Uusikylä is one of the original stations of the intermediate stations of the Lahti–Kouvola section of the Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway. Its original Class III station building was built according to plans from Knut Nylander, and was completed in 1869. At the time of the railway's opening, Uusikylä became the only station situated in the parish of Nastola; the location was chosen for the village's important location in a crossroads between Lahti, Heinola, Anjala and Artjärvi. During the Finnish Civil War, upon the landing of Detachment Brandenstein in Loviisa, it proceeded towards Uusikylä and took control of the station, destroying a section of the railway in the process and thus cutting off the Reds' connection to St. Petersburg. The lives of the Germans who fell during these battles are honored by a memorial at the station.https://www.nastola.fi/vapaa-aika/patsaat-ja-muistomerkit/sotiemme- muistokivet/ Uusikylä became the target of Soviet artillery just three days before the end of the Winter War, on 10 March 1940. The station building was completely destroyed by the fire bombings, yet no lives were lost, in spite of the idle trains that were then present at the station holding approximately 1,000 people at the time. The station management office as well as that of the post service were then temporarily transferred into a nearby bakery until the completion of the new station building in the same year. Passenger services at Uusikylä were ceased in 1971; however, they were restarted upon the electrification of the Lahti–Kouvola section in 1979. In an effort to move the passenger traffic role of the Uusikylä station to a location that would better serve the majority of the population of the municipality of Nastola, it was again closed in 2005 with the opening of the Nastola halt. Uusikylä, along with Villähde, were subsequently rebuilt and reopened in 2010, which made Nastola home to a total of three active railway stations.  Services  Uusikylä is served by all commuter trains on the route Lahti–Kouvola, and some of these services are operated from or continue towards Kotka as well. The intermediate stations between Lahti and Kouvola are also served by all but one rush hour service on the route Helsinki–Lahti–Kouvola. Eastbound trains towards Kouvola stop at track 1 and westbound ones towards Lahti use track 3; track 2 lacks a platform and is only used by long-distance trains passing through the station.

Its isolated location on Salisbury Plain between Salisbury and Andover, with a spring close by, made it a useful resting place for drovers, and later for stage and mail coaches. The quiet surroundings and solitude, interrupted only by the arrival of the coaches, also drew the critic and essayist William Hazlitt to the inn in the early 19th-century, where he regularly rented a room and produced some of his greatest writing, including Lectures on the English Comic Writers (1819) and the first volume of Table-Talk (1821). The attack on 20 October 1816 Winterslow Hut was brought to national attention when an escaped lioness attacked the horses of the London-bound Quicksilver mail coach as it drew up outside the inn during the night of 20 October 1816.

Life  Born in Bielefeld, Walther was a member of the editorial staff of the cultural magazine Der Türmer, which was published under the direction of Friedrich Lienhard who was positioned as völkisch. Walther became increasingly radicalised and became a member of the Nazi Militant League for German Culture. Walther was one of the visitors of the ' organised by Hans Grimm. From 1931 to 1936, Walther published the monthly religious and nationalist NS magazine Der Hochwart, whose editors included Robert Hohlbaum, and Börries von Münchhausen, and in which contributions and articles were published e.g. by Herbert Böhme, Georg Grabenhorst, , , , , Robert Saitschick and . At times, the journal was subtitled \\"Monatsschrift für nationalsozialistische Lebensauffassung\\" (Monthly Journal for National Socialist views of life) and stated as its goal \\"to eradicate the destructive spirit of materialism\\". Walther's journal played an important pivotal role between national conservatives authors and the more radical National Socialist Cultural Revolutionaries. In 1932, Walther proposed the construction of an open-air stage at the foot of the Wartburg, for which he received support from the reußischen Erbprinz Heinrich XLV. and also from Alfred Rosenberg and , so that the laying of the foundation stone of the \\"Wartburg-Waldbühne\\" took place in the same year. Walther received further support from , the Wartburg's castle governor. After the Machtergreifung, construction was accelerated and the stage opened on 20 April 1933 with a performance of Hanns Johst's play Schlageter. Walther moved to Potsdam and became treasurer of the newly founded .

Doctors Associates, Inc. d/b/a Subway, Case No. 19-3057-cv, was a case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that found an arbitration clause did not apply because the terms and conditions were not reasonably conspicuous and clear on a promotional webpage. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York found that \\"because the Subway webpage was relatively cluttered, did not use a conspicuous size or font for the terms and conditions link, and did not provide language informing the user that by clicking \\"I'M IN\\" the user was agreeing to anything other than the receipt of a coupon, the user would not have been on inquiry notice of the arbitration provision.\\" The ruling was appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision, writing, \\"A reasonable user would not find the terms and conditions link contained on the page to be conspicuous, since the link was at the bottom of the page, in relatively small font, and was introduced by no language other than the shorthand \\"T&Cs.;\\" A reasonable user would therefore not recognize that by clicking \\"I'M IN\\" he agreed to be bound by those terms and conditions.\\"  Background  In October 2016 Luis Arnaud visited the Subway sandwich restaurant and made a purchase. The receipt from Arnaud's meal stated that Arnaud could get \\"a discount/free item\\" if he took an electronic survey following his visit. Arnaud took the survey, which asked him for personal information including his telephone number and ZIP code. Arnaud states that he provided his mobile phone number in order to receive a discounted or free item, but insists that he never consented to receiving promotional text messages from Subway. Arnaud subsequently received hundreds of text messages from the restaurant. Subway contends that Arnaud signed up to receive text offers from Subway, and that he \\"reaffirmed his assent\\" via text message. The promotional webpage included two links, one labelled \\"T&Cs;\\" and the other labelled \\"Privacy.\\" Clicking on the link labelled \\"T&Cs;\\" was taken to a document titled \\"TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\\" In September 2019 Arnaud filed suite in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Subway moved to compel arbitration of the dispute, arguing that \\"Arnaud had agreed to arbitrate any claims against Subway at the moment he entered his phone number on a promotional page of Subway’s website and then clicked a button labeled \\"I'M IN\\" in order to receive a free sandwich.\\" Subway claimed the action \\"constituted assent to the terms and conditions contained on a separate webpage that was accessible via a hyperlink on the promotional page.\\" The District Court denied the motion because \\"no arbitration agreement existed between the parties since the terms and conditions were not reasonably clear and conspicuous on the promotional page itself.\\" Subway appealed arguing that Judge Nicholas Garaufis applied the wrong standard in evaluating whether the terms and conditions were reasonably clear and conspicuous to Arnaud; and ... that Arnaud did not provide sufficient evidence, in the form of an affidavit or otherwise, to create a factual dispute over whether he manifested his assent to the terms and conditions.\\"  References  Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Category:United States district court cases Category:2019 in United States case law ","title":"Luis Arnaud v.

It is located approximately 50 km east of Cobar and 5km south of the nearest point on the Barrier Highway. It is now virtually a ghost town but was once a much larger settlement associated with the Mount Boppy Gold Mine. At the 2016 census, the population of Candelego, including its surrounding area, was 39. In 1905, the population had been around 1,500, with around 300 of these being employees of the mine.A house at Canbelego that dates from its period as a mining village. Taken in 2017.  History  = Aboriginal and early settler history = The area now known as Canbelego is part of the traditional lands of the Wangaaypuwan dialect speakers (also known as Wangaibon) of the Ngiyampaa people. The Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell and his expedition had camped and obtained water, in early 1845, at a place that he called \\"Canbelego\\" but that was not the later site of the village; it was a location, on the Bogan river and near to the modern-day locality of Grahweed, about 30 km from Nyngan. As Mitchell tried to use local language names whenever possible, it is likely that the name Canbelego is derived from the local aboriginal dialect. After settler colonisation, the area of the village was partly within Robinson County (Parish of Cohn) and partly within Canbelego County (Parish of Florida). = Mount Boppy Gold Mine = General view of the Mt Boppy Gold Mine (c.1905) The original Mount Boppy Gold Mine operated from 1901 to 1922. It was, at the time, regarded as being the largest gold producer in New South Wales. Over that period, the mine produced 13.5 tonnes (433,000 ounces) of gold. After reef mining ceased in 1922, the old company reprocessed tailings until finally closing the site and selling off equipment in 1923. Between 1929 and 1941, there was minor production of gold from remnant ore and attempts to process tailings. Around 500,000 tonnes of tailings—still containing an average of 3g of gold per tonne—were left on the surface. Starting in 1974, these tailings were reprocessed to recover more gold. In recent years, the mine was reopened as an open-cut operation but later placed under care and maintenance. It is estimated that over its entire life, from hard-rock mining and tailings reprocessing, the mine has produced 500,000 ounces of gold. Other nearby mines were the Canbelego Copper Mining Co. (also known as 'the Burra', located 5 miles south of the village), The North Mount Boppy Gold Mining Co., and the Restdown Copper Mining Co. (15 miles south-east of Canbelego). = Mining village = Canbelego Public School c.1904.The village of Canbelego was proclaimed in December 1902. By mid-1904, the rapidly growing population had reached around 900, with 180 employed at the Mt Boppy Mine. The post office opened in 1901, predating the village and was originally named Mount Bobby Mines. The public school, established in 1901, had an enrollment of 158, and an average attendance of 120. The main street, Edward Street, had three hotels, six stores, two butchers, a baker, blacksmith, billiard saloon, cool drink shops, many boarding houses, a post office, and a court house under construction. There was also a local doctor. The first of its church buildings, the Presbyterian Church, was shared when necessary with other denominations, pending other churches being built. All the houses in the town were neat houses of weatherboard construction, not the temporary structures common in mining towns of that time. On the outskirts of the village, a sawmill was busy cutting timber for building work in the growing village.The Commercial Hotel, the longest lived of Canbelego's three hotels (c.1904). From around 1906, the village had its own horse racing course and race meetings were held there on New Year's Day until the racing club was wound up in 1912. In 1908, a second school, a Catholic Convent School was opened, with four Sisters of St.Joseph and 70 pupils. Australian War Memorial records show five men from Canbelego went to the First World War. One of them, John Bray, perhaps unsurprisingly for a miner, was a sapper in the 3rd Tunnelling Company, A.I.F., when he was killed in France in 1916. Only one of the five men survived the war. However, a contemporaneous report states that Canbelego had raised three contingents of volunteer recruits—the last of consisting of eight young men—by September 1915. In 1917, the population was said to be around 2000 but, in February of that year, hard rock mining was suspended at the Mt Boppy Gold Mine, possibly an early sign that the future of the mine was in doubt. The population began to decline. In July 1919, Canbelego suffered a serious outbreak of Spanish Influenza. Most of the community were infected—temporarily closing the mine and overwhelming the small hospital—resulting in at least nine deaths in one week. Water was precious in the semi-arid environment, with enormous amounts being needed for the processing operations. The mine had a 13 million gallon dam, condensed the exhaust steam from its steam engines for return to the boilers, and distilled brackish mine water. In the early 1920s, the area was subject to a long drought, which affected mining operations at the Mt Boppy mine. The final closure of the Mount Boppy Gold Mine, in 1922-1923, was the beginning of the end of Canbelego's prosperity. By this time, the population was down to around 1,000, but it rapidly fell still further, without a major source of employment in the area. A few years later, in 1925, it was reported that, \\"a handful is left hanging on in hope that the old field will come again\\" and in 1929, \\"there are very few houses and shops in Canbelego\\". The convent school had closed at the end of 1923. Limited gold production between 1829 and 1941 allowed the village to persist, with diminished circumstances. In 1931, the population was still 261. By 1949, there were only 93 inhabitants.Boppy Mount station c.1910. In 1938, the village—by then described as \\"one hotel and cluster of houses\\"— briefly relived its former glory, when its Country Rugby Leaque team—the smallest club of the 500 in the state—won 20 of its 22 games. The team was still in existence in the 1950s. The old Commercial Hotel was destroyed by fire in 1956 but a new hotel opened in 1959. By 1962, almost all that was left of the facilities of the village was the public school with a few pupils, each of whom planted a tree in the school grounds that year, and the post office. The post office closed in 1987. There was a platform on the Cobar railway line, at a siding called Florida, located to the north of the village. Boppy Mount (also known as Boppy Mountain)—4.5 km by road to the north-west of the village—was the station for the village and there was a hamlet there in the very early 20th century. The railway still exists but is for freight only and the station no longer exists. A road now provides Canbelego's connection to the Barrier Highway. Canbelego's location, off the Barrier Highway, means that it sees little passing traffic. Edward Street, the main street of the village, other streets of the old village, and allotments still appear on maps but the land is now mainly vacant. The village no longer has any public facilities or services. There is a lonely and neglected cemetery to the north-west of the old village.

It replaces the egg yolk of other animals, which in snail eggs is reduced to non-nutritive proteinaceous granules with putative enzymatic function. During embryonic development the perivitelline fluid is ingested macropinocytotically by the embryos and the resulting phagosomes fuse with β-granules containing hydrolytic enzymes, which digest the perivitelline fluid components.  Origin  The perivitelline fluid is synthesized by the albumen gland of female snails (also known as albumen gland-capsule gland complex or uterine gland), an accessory gland from the reproductive tract. Fertilized oocytes enter the albumen gland and, on their way out, are coated with the perivitielline fluid. The amount of perivitelline fluid per egg vary considerably among species. However, the amount of perivitelline fluid per egg is constant within a given species. In this regard, it has been shown in Pomacea apple snails that during the reproductive season, when the nutrient precursors decrease in the albumen gland due to successive ovipositions, females tend to reduce the number of eggs per clutch but not the amount allocated to each egg.  Composition  The perivitelline fluid contains predominantly galactogen, proteins, and calcium. Carbohydrate is invariably the most abundant component of the perivitelline fluid. Specifically, the eggs of most gastropod accumulate the polysaccharide galactogen, which would provide the main energy source for the developing embryo. A small amount of soluble glucose was also detected in some species. Proteins, called perivitellins, are the second most abundant component of the perivitelline fluid. Perivitellins are also a source of nutrients for snail embryos and play a role in protection against pathogens and predators, and include non- digestible perivitellins, toxins and protease inhibitors. These proteins were thoroughly studied in apple snails from the genus Pomacea, where they were originally grouped in two most abundant protein fractions perivitellin-1 or PV1, perivitellin-2 or PV2 (comprising approximately 70% of total protein), and a heterogeneous fraction dubbed perivitellin-3 or PV3 fraction. Recent proteomic analyses, however, showed that the perivitelline fluid from Pomacea snails has between 34-38 different proteins with a wide variety of functions. Lipids are a minor component, mostly represented by membrane lipids, indicating that snails do not use lipids as a major energy reserve during reproduction. Apart from structural lipids, some eggs also contain carotenoid pigments, notably astaxanthin. These lipidic pigments have been associated with antioxidant and photoprotective functions, and also provide Pomacea eggs with the typical bright color that would function as a warning signal (i.e. aposematism) to deter predators. Among the inorganic components, calcium ion is the most abundant in the perivitelline fluid. As these snails have direct development, calcium needs to be stored to allow the snail to develop the shell during organogenesis. Besides, calcium is the main component of the eggshell of those snails with aerial oviposition.

Early life Richard Abrom Henries was born in Monrovia, Liberia on 16 September 1908 unto the union of George E. Henries, an Americo-Liberian carpenter and merchant, and Eliza B. Henries, nee Robinson, a seamstress. Henries was orphaned at age sixteen years old when his parents died in 1924. Henries subsequently lived with his grandmother and two aunts. Education Henries graduated at the top of his class from the College of West Africa in 1927. Because he had had a difficult time putting himself through high school, he decided not to go to college. However, his aunt, the late Martha Robinson and her husband, the late Henry A. Clements, encouraged him to enroll at Liberia College and promised to help him with his tuition. Henries enrolled in college, led his class throughout his college years and graduated in 1931 as the valedictorian of his class with a Bachelors degree in mathematics. Henries was subsequently appointed as an Associate Professor of Mathematics a few months after his graduation from Liberia College. Subsequently, from 1946 to 1951, he served the University of Liberia as secretary of the Board of Trustees and, from 1951 to 1980, as president of the Board. At different times, during the years after his graduation, his alma mater conferred upon him the honorary degrees of Doctor of Laws, Doctor of Civil Laws and Doctor of Humanities. Death Henries was one of the thirteen Americo-Liberian political leaders who were executed in the 1980 Liberian coup. Personal life Henries was married to Angie Brooks, a Liberian, and subsequently to A. Doris Banks Henries, an African American.

As a journalist, she spent more than seven decades as a reporter and editor at Tygodnik Powszechny, a Catholic weekly newspaper headquartered in Krakow. Hennelowa also served in the Sejm, the lower house of the Parliament of Poland, from 1989 until 1993 during the country's transition from communism to democracy. Biography Józefa Hennelowa was born Józefa Maria Golmont on April 1, 1925, in Vilnius, Poland (modern-day Lithuania), to an ethnic Polish family. Her father was a tailor who created cassocks for Catholic clergy. She originally wanted to be a violinist, rather than a journalist, and became interested in Juliusz Osterwa's life and career while studying in Krakow. During World War II, she joined the women's wing of the Gray Ranks, an underground resistance group opposed to the German occupation, and secretly taught in Vilnius. Following the war and the incorporation of Vilnius into the Soviet Union, Hennelowa moved to the new post-war Poland. She was a graduate of Jagiellonian University in Krakow. She worked as the Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences in Krakow from 1954 to 1956 and then the Krakow office of the Ossolineum. Hennelowa joined the Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej, or Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, in 1956. She also became involved with the Association of Polish Journalists. Hennelowa first joined the staff of Tygodnik Powszechny, a Catholic weekly published in Krakow, as a proofreader in 1948. She rose over her career to become a reporter, then the newspaper's editor, and secretary of the editorial office. From 1982 until 2012, Hennelowa published a series of regular columns and opinion pieces, including \\"Widziane z Domu\\", \\"Z Domu i not Only\\", \\"Votum separatum\\", and \\"Na marginesie.\\" She remained deputy editor-in-chief until 2008. In 1984, Father Jerzy Popiełuszko, a Catholic priest associated with Solidarity, was assassinated by agents from the Ministry of Public Security, the country's secret police. Hennelowa covered the murder trial for Tygodnik Powszechny, though state censors made her work difficult. In 1989, as Communist rule began to wane, Hennelowa and her husband, , joined the Citizens' Movement for Democratic Action (ROAD), a short-lived political party. Hennelowa was elected to the Contract Sejm, the transitional parliament, in 1989 as a ROAD candidate, serving her first term from 1989 to 1991. When ROAD split, she and her faction joined Tadeusz Mazowiecki's new Democratic Union (UD), where she became one the party's founding members in 1990. As a UD member, Hennelowa was re-elected to the Sejm in 1991, where she served until 1993. Hennelowa later became a member of the Freedom Union from 1994 to 1999. She ran afoul of some in the Polish political right-wing, who falsely accused her of being pro- abortion. Hennelowa, however, was anti-abortion, but she also strongly opposed punishments for women who chose to undergo an abortion. Hennelowa belonged to Amnesty International from 1990 to 1996, the Association \\"Polish Community\\", also from 1990 until 1996, and the (SKOZK) until 2008.

From 1970 to 1987 he was the first director of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (nl). From 1987 to 1995 he was director and rector of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study. Van de Kaa was professor of demography at the University of Amsterdam between 1978 and 1998. Life Van de Kaa was born on 5 January 1933 in Scherpenzeel. His father was a mailman while his mother was a housewife. After attending primary school during World War II he attended the Hogere Burgerschool in Amersfoort. Van de Kaa obtained a degree in social geography at Utrecht University in 1959. After obtaining his degree he had to perform military service and was sent for training to become an officer in the Netherlands Marine Corps. He was subsequently sent to Netherlands New Guinea as a second lieutenant. After having served for only a couple of months van de Kaa was asked to return to the Netherlands and leave military service to help assist in setting up a demographic survey of Netherlands New Guinea. By February 1961 he was back in Netherlands New Guinea. When in 1962 the terroritory was handed over to Indonesia the field work of the survey had been done. Between 1963 and 1966 van de Kaa made several publications based on the material. In 1966 van de Kaa was asked by the Australian National University to become a researcher at their instition. He was asked to perform research on Papua New Guinea in a similar way he had done before in Netherlands New Guinea. He obtained his PhD in demography at the Australian National University in 1971 with a thesis titled: \\"The demography of Papua and New Guinea's indigenous population\\". In 1970 the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (nl) (NIDI) was created and van de Kaa was asked to become its first director. During the 1970s he was scientific secretary of the State Commission Muntendam which dealt with population growth. In the late 1970s van de Kaa formulated the idea of a second demographic transition which leads to a sub-replacement fertility- level. He remained director of the NIDI until 1987. Van de Kaa subsequently served as director and rector of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study from 1987 to 1995. From 1978 to 1987 he was part-time professor (Dutch: buitengewoon hoogleraar) of demography at the University of Amsterdam. Between 1987 and 1988 he was a regular professor. From 1988 to 1998 he was an unpaid regular professor. He was a professor of the Cleveringa chair (Dutch: bijzonder hoogleraar) at Leiden University from 1991 to 1992. He was vice president of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research between 1988 and 1998. Van de Kaa was chairperson of the Sociaal Wetenschappelijke Raad of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences between 1990 and 1996. Van de Kaa was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. He was elected a member of the Academia Europaea in 1989. In 1991 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He is an honorary fellow of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute. Van de Kaa serves as member of council of Population Europe.

After being withdrawn from Russia, in June 1919 the division was sent along with the rest of I Corps to take up occupation duties in the Smyrna Zone. The division was headquartered at Manisa. It participated in all subsequent operations of the Asia Minor Campaign in 1920–1922. In the interwar period, due to the reduction in the size of the army, the division was disbanded, until the December 1939 changes to the mobilization plan, which re-established the 13th Division at Mytilene, in the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos, under the V Army Corps.

They are multifunctional complexes providing the developing embryo with nutrition, protection from the environment, and defense against predators. Despite the central role perivitellins play in reproduction and development, there is little information about their role in gastropod Molluscs. Most studies of perivitellins have been performed in eggs of Ampullaridae, a family of freshwater snails (Caenogastropoda), notably the Pomacea genus, mostly those of Pomacea canaliculata, Pomacea scalaris and Pomacea maculata.  Synthesis  Perivitellins are almost exclusively synthesized in the albumen gland (also known as albumen gland-capsule gland complex or uterine gland), an accessory gland from the female reproductive system of gastropods. This has been experimentally confirmed for the perivitellins ovorubin (PcOvo) and PcPV2, which were only found in the albumen gland with no extra-gland synthesis, circulation or storage. During the reproductive season, these perivitellins are transferred to eggs. After oviposition, they are rapidly restored in the albumen gland, decreasing their total amount in the gland only after repeated ovipositions. In Pomacea canaliculata snails, perivitellins would act, together with the polysaccharide galactogen, as a limiting factor of the reproductive effort during reproduction.  Types of perivitellins  The first studies performed in Pomacea canaliculata identified two proteins named perivitellin-1, PV1 or ovorubin (now called PcOvo) and perivitellin-2 or PV2 massively accumulated in eggs, comprising 60-70% of total protein, respectively, and a heterogeneous fraction dubbed perivitellin-3 or PV3 fraction. Recent proteomic analyses of perivitelline fluids, however, identified a total of 34 proteins from Pomacea canaliculata, 38 in Pomacea maculata, and 32 in Pomacea diffusa. Perivitellin-1 or PcOvo (former ovorubin) and perivitellin-2 or PcPV2 are probably the best characterized from snails. Both perivitellins are multimeric and glycosylated proteins with remarkable thermal stability up to 100°C and 60°C, respectively, and over a wide range of pH. They are also highly resistant to the combined action of pepsin and trypsin proteases. The perivitelline fluid of Pomacea scalaris and Pomacea diffusa contain one major perivitellin, PsSC (also named scalarin) and PdPV1, respectively, which are structurally and phylogenetically related to PcOvo. The perivitelline fluid of P. maculata is also similar, with two major perivitellins, PmPV1 and PmPV2, structurally and functionally similar to PcOvo and PcPV2, respectively. The rest of Pomacea perivitellins (over 25) have been characterized at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, but biochemical studies are still largely missing.  Perivitellin functions  Perivitellins provide nutrition, energy storage, defense against predation, and protection from the environment to the developing embryo. A functional classification of the perivitellin aminoacid sequences based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), classified them in \\"environmental information processing\\", among which several immune proteins are included, \\"metabolism\\", \\"organismal systems\\", \\"cellular processes\\", \\"other\\", and a considerable number of \\"unknown\\" proteins. The first functional studies performed in Pomacea canaliculata, considered them mostly as storage proteins that provided energetic and structural precursors for the embryos, since they are consumed during development. Later research on PV1s (PcOvo, PmPV1, and PsSC) reported that their carotenoid cofactor, notably astaxanthin, serves as a potent antioxidant and provides the reddish color to the eggs. These carotenoproteins are also highly resistant to gastrointestinal digestion, and withstand the passage through the digestive system without significant modifications; this characteristic was related to embryo defenses, deterring predators by lowering the nutritional value of the eggs. PcOvo and PsSC also carry phosphate groups attached to serine residues that may serve as a phosphorus reserve for the embryo. Unlike PcOvo and PmPV1, PsSC is also an active lectin that agglutinates bacteria and alters the gastrointestinal mucosa of rats, functions associated with embryo protection against both pathogens and predators. PV2s are toxins only found in Pomacea canaliculata (PcPV2) and Pomacea maculata (PmPV2) perivitelline fluid. They are potent neurotoxins when intraperitoneally injected to mice, while exerting enterotoxic functions when ingested. Each of the two dimeric units of either PcPV2 or PmPV2 consists of a carbohydrate-binding protein of the tachylectin family (acting as a targeting module) disulfide-linked to a pore-forming subunit of the Membrane Attack Complex and Perforin (MACPF) subfamily (toxic module). These toxins bear a structural resemblance to botulinic and ricin heterodimeric toxins, the so-called “AB toxins” previously known only in bacteria and plants. Perivitellin-2 is also resistant to gastrointestinal digestion, which contributes to lowering the egg nutritional value. Finally, a recent study of Pomacea canaliculata PV3 fraction identified and characterized two protease inhibitors from the Kunitz and Kazal families, a function also related to an antipredator defense since it would prevent predators to digest proteins from the eggs when ingested.

It tells the story of a boy who wants to become a mermaid and participate in the Coney Island Mermaid Parade. Love first began writing the book in 2014 while she worked as an actress, and it was published in 2018 by Candlewick Press. The book received wide praise from critics, both for its emotional depth and the author's artistic decision to mix watercolor, gouache and ink in her paintings, as well as for her usage of pastel tones against a more muted background. Julián is a Mermaid was awarded the Stonewall Book Award and the Klaus Flugge Prize, and was highlighted in several \\"Best Of\\" lists.  Plot  One day, while in the subway with his grandma, Julián sees some of the participants of the Coney Island Mermaid Parade. Julián becomes fascinated by them and starts dreaming of becoming a mermaid swimming in the sea. Back home, while his grandmother is at the shower, Julián fashions himself a mermaid outfit with a variety of materials he finds at home, including a potted plant and the curtains. After leaving the bath, his grandmother gives what seems a disapproving look and leaves for a while, just to return with a smile on her face and a pearl necklace for Julián. His grandmother then takes him to the parade, where he gets to walk with all the other mermaids.  Development  Love began writing Julián is a Mermaid while she worked as an actress on a Jez Butterworth's play, in 2014. After writing an initial draft, she kept working on the art until 2016. At the time she considered self-publishing the book, but decided to look for an agent before. During her debut on Broadway, she met with Mary-Louise Parker. Parker helped Love find an agent who was willing to help publish her book. The book's draft, which was originally 45 pages long, called \\"insanely long\\" by Love's agent, was sent to Candlewick Press, and later accepted for publishing. After that, Love decided to redraw the whole book, this time on a paper similar to kraft, instead of white paper, believing it would be better for the warmer and pastel tones she used throughout it. Love's initial plan was to have Julián meet with drag queens on their way to a drag ball, inspired by the RuPaul's Drag Race show, but, in an interview with PinkNews, she said she changed the characters to mermaids, as her research uncovered the mythical creature's significance to the transgender population: \\"There's something about mermaids. Who knows if that's because they're magical creatures who can live between two realities or because they don't have any genitals\\".  Influences  Love says she was inspired to write the book when she met her partner's older brother, who had recently transitioned, a couple years before beginning to write the book. According to Love, due to pushback from his family when younger, he was only able to transition after he was fifty years old, and talking to him inspired her to research the subject, including the literature available about it. The 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning, which tells the story of drag queens that were rejected by their families and found acceptance in a different place, was another inspiration. Love said in an interview with the Guardian that she wanted to write a story \\"about what their lives would have been like if they’d received the kind of support from their birth families\\". Love also said having grown with queer role models – her aunt and her wife – had a positive impact on her family, and she \\"wanted to make a book that provided that kind of support and pride of place\\".  Reception  Love's debut book was received positively by critics. Sarah Hunter, writing for The Booklist, praised Love's use of muted backgrounds, which helped highlight the main scenes, as well as her \\"saturated, opaque tones tracing the graceful shapes of the figures\\". The School Library Journal called it \\"[a] heartwarming must-have for one-on-one and small group sharing\\". Minh Lê, writing for The Horn Book Magazine, called attention to the small details present in Love's drawings, such as \\"a wary look in the mirror\\", and how they add depth to Julián's story. He also praised the author's mix of watercolor, gouache, and ink. Kirkus Reviews also praised Love's use of mixed techniques, calling it \\"perfect for this watercentric tale\\". Although it says the story might \\"feel preachy\\", it praises its \\"recognition and approval of [Julián's] gender nonconformity\\", as well as the fact that words in Spanish are not italicized. Amy McKay, in her review for The School Librarian, calls Love's illustrations \\"joyous\\" and the story \\"a true celebration of uniqueness\\", and praises her ability to tell the story with as little text as possible. McKay also highlights the emotional state of the main character, going from proud to anxious as the story develops, and \\"filling readers with empathy and hope for his acceptance\\". She also mentions Love's use of brown paper, which \\"make for a special reading experience\\".  Awards and accolades  Julián is a Mermaid received a series of awards, including the 2018 Opera Prima Bologna Children's Book Fair, the 2019 Stonewall Book Award and the 2019 Klaus Flugge Prize. In its release year, Love was awarded the Silver Medal from the Society of Illustrators. Julián is a Mermaid was highlighted by several online magazines and websites in \\"Best Of\\" lists. New York magazine included it in a list titled \\"The Best Children's Books for LGBTQ+ Families, According to Experts\\", with one of the booksellers calling it \\"beautiful, simple and unapologetic\\". In a list for The New York Times, Linda Sue Park chose Love's debut book to feature on her list of \\"Picture Books to Help Kids Weather Our Age of Anxiety\\".

Even though the ship was not fully commissioned until 1883, she played a minor role in the French occupation of Tunisia in 1881. Tempête accidentally sank a torpedo boat during night maneuvers in 1892 and was placed in reserve later that year. She became the flagship of the local defenses in French Tunisia in 1897 and was decommissioned in 1907. The ironclad served as a target ship for the next several years until she was sunk in 1909. Her wreck was salvaged beginning in 1912, but it was not completed until 1959. Design and description The design of the Tempête-class coast-defense ships was based on that of the British breastwork monitors and . To maximize the traverse of the single gun turret, the superstructure was as narrow as possible, only wide. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of forward and aft at deep load. They displaced at deep load. The crew of the Tempête class numbered 7 officers and 165 enlisted men.Caresse, pp. 161–162 The Tempête class was powered by a single six-cylinder, horizontal compound-expansion steam engine that drove one propeller shaft using steam provided by four IndretCaresse, p. 163 cylindrical boilers. The engine was rated at Campbell, p. 299 and was intended to give the ships a top speed of . During her sea trials Tempête reached a speed of from . The ships carried enough coal to give them a range of at a speed of . =Armament and armor= The Tempêtes carried their main battery of two Canon de Modèle 1875 guns in a single twin-gun turret, forward of the superstructure. Defense from torpedo boats was provided by four Canon de Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns and four Hotchkiss revolving cannon. The 47 mm guns were positioned on the corners of the hurricane deck on top of the superstructure and the revolver guns were placed between them, two on each broadside. The ships had a full-length wrought-iron waterline armor belt that tapered from the maximum thickness of amidships to at the ships' ends. The armored breastwork supporting the superstructure and the turret was long and was also 330 mm thick. The main deck was protected by iron plates, as was the deck below it. The turret armor was thick and was backed by of teak. The plates protecting the conning tower measured 250 mm in thickness. Construction and career Tempête (Tempest),Silverstone, p. 112 was authorized in the 1872 Naval Program as a second-class coastal-defense ship. She was ordered from the Arsenal de Brest on 26 December 1872 and was laid down that same day. The ship was launched on 18 August 1876, construction being delayed by numerous minor changes to the design. Tempête was commissioned for preliminary trials on 29 November 1879, but a boiler accident on 1 March 1880 burned three stokers. Her sea trials were completed on 26 March 1890, although the ship was not fully commissioned () until 4 July 1883.Caresse, pp. 161, 163–166 Despite this, she supported operations at Bizerte during the French occupation of Tunisia in 1881.Gille, p. 72Roche, p. 465 Her construction cost 6,430,000 francs.Caresse, p. 161 On 10 July, Tempête conducted tests to see if her wooden boats would be damaged by muzzle blast of her guns firing at their aft limit of traverse. The boats were undamaged, but the superstructure was damaged and needed to be strengthened. Later that year, she began taking on water in rough seas as she exited the Roadstead of Brest () and the Maritime Prefect () of Brest decided that she was only to sail in fine weather. The ship ran aground in the roadstead on 4 August 1888 and had to wait until the next tide to free herself, although she proved to be undamaged when docked for examination. During night maneuvers in the roadstead on 20 July 1892, Tempête accidentally collided with and sank torpedo boat No. 76. The ironclad was reduced to reserve later that year.Caresse, p. 166 Her boilers were replaced in 1896–1897 and she was declared operational again on 15 June of the latter year. Tempête became the flagship of the Naval Division of Tunisia () that provided local defense for the eastern part of French North Africa and arrived in Bizerte on 25 July. She towed torpedo boat No. 122 to Algiers, French Algeria on 28 April–9 May 1898. The ironclad arrived in Toulon on 22 May 1900 for maintenance and she was damaged when her supporting timbers collapsed while she was in a dry dock to have her bottom painted. Much of her her hull plating had to be replaced and the ship did not return to Tunisia until 8 August.Caresse, pp. 167–168, 171 Thoroughly obsolete by this time, the ship was ordered back to Toulon on 30 December 1905 to pay off and arrived there on 22 January 1906; she was decommissioned on 15 February. Tempête was stricken from the navy list on 26 April 1907 and she was to be used as a target ship for the ships of the Mediterranean Squadron (). On 17–18 March 1909 Tempête was anchored in Alicastre Bay at the island of Porquerolles serving as target for the battleships , , , and . The ironclad required temporary repairs to remain afloat after being engaged by the latter ship on the 18th, but they were ineffective as Tempête began list to port. She capsized in bad weather two days later at coordinates .Caresse, pp. 171–174 An unsuccessful auction for the salvage right for the wreck was conducted on 4 February 1910, but it was sold on 21 December 1912 for 8,755 francs. Demolition was interrupted by the beginning of World War I in August 1914, but resumed on 18 September 1915 at a slow pace. After removing most of the hull and superstructure the wreck was abandoned in the mid-1920s. The remnants of the wreck, including her armament, was salvaged in 1959. Little remains there today.Caresse, pp. 173–174 Citations Bibliography  * * Category:1876 ships Category:Ships built in France Category:Tempête-class ironclads ","title":"French ironclad Tempête"},{"id":"65398450","text":"Giuseppe Borghi (born 28 September 1892, date of death unknown) was an Italian racing cyclist.

Darke is an expert on disability in film and politics.  Early life and education  Born in Frimley, Camberley, Darke attended special education boarding schools in Kent and Hampshire. He left school with little to no qualifications. In interviews, he credits an encounter with a fellow patient who was a psychologist during an unforeseen stay in hospital, to return to education. He also met his future wife, Claire, who was working there as a nurse. After a few years out of education, he went to study at the then Wolverhampton Polytechnic at the age of 23, doing a computer access course for the disabled. He gained an MA in American Literature from Keele University. In 1999, he completed his PhD on the portrayal of disabled people in film at the University of Warwick.  Academic work  Darke's work on disability and film had a major impact on academia and society. He invented the term 'normality drama', to describe a film genre which focuses on the life and experiences of a disabled protagonist. His theory is that normality drama uses abnormal— impaired—characters to deal with a perceived threat to the dominant social hegemony of normality. He has written about movies such as The Elephant Man and Whose Life is it Anyway, as well as television shows such as Family Guy calling Seth Macfalane's show a 'bold step forward in the canon of disability works'. He regularly contributes to broadcast media. He has received a Wingate Scholarship and a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Scholarship to research disability and culture in western societies as well as exploring disability access to pilgrimages and shrines.  Activism  Darke is the founder and director of Outside Centre, a disability arts organisation based in Wolverhampton. It created the first ever Disability Film Festival in the United Kingdom. Outside Centre also worked to improve the health of local disabled people through a health and well-being programme. He is also an artist and filmmaker. He produced 'Motion Disabled', an art installation using motion capture technology to represent real disabled people that was shown in over 20 countries. In previous roles, he held the role of director at the West Midlands Disability Arts Forum, and worked with Disability Arts in Shropshire for the 2012 Cultural Olympiad. He published a book about the London Paralympic Games from a disability art perspective. In addition, he helped launch the UK Disability History Month and has written Disabiliy Equality Training for the United Nations. He is a philatelist, holding the largest recorded collection of disability themed stamps in the world. To further document disability history, he is a producer at the Invalid Carriage Museum. In 2017, Darke created and organised Wolves in Wolves, the largest public art exhibition which took place in Wolverhampton. Darke is a significant voice and active member of the British Labour Party advocating for disabled people's rights. He is an active supporter of Momentum and has hosted events at The World Transformed and the Labour Party Conference. He has previously called Labour politician David Blunkett 'in denial of his impairment as an experience' and has critisised the outsourcing of work capability assessments to Atos alongside Disabled People Against Cuts. He has also worked with the European Network of Independent Living to support disabled people's human rights and submitted evidence to parliamentary committees. He has been included on the list of the UKs most influential disabled people.  Whistleblower  In 2001, Darke ran a website criticising charity Leonard Cheshire to highlight their role in institutionalising those with disabilities and neglecting those in their care. He bought the domain name www.leonard- cheshire.com after resigning from the role of national advocacy officer and their public affairs committee. Among other things, he stated that 'the main reason you cease to be a Leonard Cheshire service user is death' and that charity donations would pay for 'private medical insurance of senior directors and management get-togethers costing £10,000 a weekend'. After a heated debate on BBC Radio 4, as well as 50,000 hits on the website, Leonard Cheshire submitted a complaint to the World Intellectual Property Organization. WIPO ruled that Darke has no right or legitimate interest in the domain name; and that it has been registered and used by him in bad faith. As of today, the domain name is unused. Leonard Cheshire have subsequently changed their name to Leonard Cheshire Disability. The case is now citied in legal textbooks.  Personal life  He is a wheelchair user who has spina bifida. His wife, Claire Darke, is the mayor of Wolverhampton, they have a son.

Her research focuses on Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium causing cholera. She is a professor of life sciences at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where she heads the Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology.  Career  Blokesch studied biology and microbiology at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where she received her diploma in 2000. She then joined August Böck's laboratory as a doctoral student and in 2004, graduated with her PhD awarded summa cum laude on \\"[NiFe]-Hydrogenases of Escherichia coli: Functions of Proteins involved in Metal Center Assembly\\". In 2005, she went to work as postdoctoral research fellow with Gary K. Schoolnik in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University. In 2009, she became Assistant Professor in the Global Health Institute at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, where she was promoted as Associate Professor in 2016. Since 2009, she has been the director of the Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology.  Research  Blokesch's research group investigates the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae that afflicts humans and has been responsible for major pandemics throughout history. She is interested how the natural environment of the bacterium is linked to its potential to evolve into a human pathogen. Her group studies how V. cholerae acquires new capabilities via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). They found the pilous fraction of the DNA-uptake machinery also enables the adherence to chitinous surfaces, such as exoskeleton of arthropods, also under conditions of water currents. Further they discovered that V. cholerae actively forages for DNA by killing neighboring cells via type VI secretion system (T6SS) while being able to spare kin cells. Thereby DNA chunks even beyond the length of 150kb are taken up and exchanged against regions of the bacterium’s genome. They started also working on the HGT capabilities of Acinetobacter baumannii, another human pathogen, known for frequently being resistant to a variety of antibiotics, and mostly associated with high infection rates in hospital settings. In order to better understand the interaction of host and pathogen, they also investigate routes of transmission in endemic cholera hot-spots. They descovered several virulence factors that might be used by V. cholerae in a Trojan horse-like manner to replicate in aquatic amoebae, and thereby could facilitate transmission. The research of Blokesch and her group has been featured in international news outlets such as La Razón, Radio Télévision Suisse, The Times of India, National Geographic Magazine and Deutschlandfunk.  Distinctions  Blokesch was elected as a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2019 and of the European Academy of Microbiology in 2018. In 2017, she was selected among 25 life changing women (\\"25 Frauen, deren Erfindungen unser Leben verändern\\") by four German news outlets (Edition F, ZEIT online, Handelsblatt and Gründerszene).

Opened in 1926, it has not been used since 1992, but as of 2020 there were active plans to construct a new theatre on the site, incorporating elements of the existing building. The Teatro Variedades is located in the Mayer Park (Parque Mayer), in Lisbon, close to the Avenida da Liberdade. It was part of a complex of theatres at the park that included the Teatro Maria Vitória, which was the first to be constructed. Its construction was first considered in 1922 by the entrepreneur , and building began two years later, under the direction of the architect Urbano de Castro. The theatre was inaugurated on 8 July 1926, with a variety show called Pó de Arroz (Rice Powder), with a cast that included Vasco Santana, as the main attraction and Augusto Costa as the compère. There were two shows: one at 21.00 and the other at 22.45. Although the theatre was well-received and the performances were acclaimed by the audience it was not an auspicious opening because the following day it had to close for a day when the Ditadura Nacional (National Dictatorship) overthrew the short-lived presidency of General Manuel de Oliveira Gomes da Costa. Teatro Variedades produced about five long-running variety shows a year until the 1960s, usually involving two shows a day and three on Sundays. Famous Portuguese performers to perform there include Laura Alves, Palmira Bastos, Beatriz Costa, , Raul Solnado, and the fado singer Amália Rodrigues. In time there was a falling off in the popularity of such shows, due to the increased popularity of television. After having been renovated in the early 1960s, the theatre suffered from a fire in 1966, as did other buildings in the park. Some renovation was carried out at the beginning of the 1990s and Teatro Variedades was used for a 26-part RTP (Rádio e Televisão de Portugal) series of variety programmes in 1992, directed by Filipe La Féria, with a range of guest artists who had distinguished themselves in some of the shows at the theatre, in addition to a fixed cast with younger performers. There was a desire to make the theatre return to its former glory but, in fact, these were the last performances it would see.

The division formed part of the Patras-based II Army Corps. As a result of the National Schism, the division was disbanded in 1916. The division was reformed in 1918 as part of the reconstituted II Corps, but only served during the final weeks of the war, in the pursuit of the Bulgarian forces around Strumitsa, under the disposal of XVI British Corps. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, the division, reduced in strength to men, formed part of the Army of Thrace and did not see any combat, being responsible for covering the Greek–Yugoslav, and later the Greek–Bulgarian, borders. In the interwar period, due to the reduction in the size of the army, the division was disbanded, until the December 1939 changes to the mobilization plan, which re-established the 14th Division at Xanthi, in northern Greece, under IV Army Corps. During the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41, the 14th Division remained uninvolved, forming part of the Eastern Macedonia Army Section (TSAM) covering the Metaxas Line on the border with Bulgaria. In the Battle of the Metaxas Line, TSAM was outflanked and forced to capitulate during the German invasion of Greece in April 1941.

Life  Born in Hamburg, Wachtel, born the son of a hackney carriage owner, was himself a haulage contractor after his father's death until his voice, a beautiful and powerful lyrical tenor, was discovered. His first teacher was Julie Grandjean in Hamburg. The twenty-six-year-old made his first attempt on the stage at the municipal theatre of his hometown; shortly before that, on 1 March 1849, he had already attracted the attention of the general public in a concert he had organised himself, in which his fellow countryman Johannes Brahms also took part.Wachtel, Theodor on Operissimo As a beginner, Wachtel first worked at the court theatre in Schwerin for one year, then he turned to Würzburg, where he was encouraged by the lessons of the Kapellmeister Witt and the singer Frieda Beck-Weichselbaum. In 1852, he followed a call to the Staatstheater Darmstadt. There, he sang, among others, in the first Tannhäuser performance of Walther, and in 1853 he sang the title role in Der Postillon von Lonjumeau, in which he later had the greatest success. From 1854 until 1858, he worked in Hannover, then in Kassel, and from 1863 until 1865, he was a member of the Vienna court opera. Guest performances led him to all major opera houses in Germany, and from 1862 until 1868 he went to London for several months every year, where he sang on the Italian stage of the Coventgardentheater, in 1869 to Paris, in 1871 and 1878 to America.Ludwig Eisenberg: Wachtel, Theodor. In Großes biographisches Lexikon der deutschen Bühne im XIX. Jahrhundert. From the end of the 60's, he did not take up a permanent stage position. He first chose his retirement home in Wiesbaden, later on, after several years in Berlin, he moved to Frankfurt, where he died at the age of 70. He gave his last concert in Berlin on 8 March 1893.Wachtel, Theodor on ¨Großes Sängerlexikon () His best roles, apart from the postillon, which he played more than 1000 times, were \\"George Brown\\", \\"Sever\\", \\"Lyonel\\", \\"Vasco de Gama\\". Wachtel's musical education has always remained limited, all the better was the purely technical training of his voice, which enabled him to appear before the Berlin audience at a charity concert on the eve of his seventieth birthday; the splendour of the magnificent organ had remained almost intact. In terms of acting and the spiritual penetration of his roles, Wachtel has always fallen short of even modest standards.Text nach Max Friedländer (ADB) He was appointed an honorary member of the Mecklenburg State Theatre and Coburg.

It was the headquarters of Order of the Holy Sepulchre for centuries. Its presbytery houses the original 14th-century polychromy made with fresco-secco technique. Order of the Holy Sepulchre arrived in Poznań from Miechowo in the second half of the 12th century. Over 70 years later, Przemysł I and Bolesław the Pious founded the monastery and church in the suburbs of Gniezno. Monastics lived here until the dissolution by Prussian authorities.  Architecture  Saint John the Baptist Church, is the oldest and best preserved monument of Polish Gothic, sacred architecture. The church was erected by the Order of the Guardians of the Holy Sepulchre , who arrived to Gniezno from Miechów. Its site provides a view over the former Hill of Teutonic Knights. The church was built in 1331. St. John’s Church is a one nave, extended, gothic building which was built of brick according to the Polish scheme of building. However, its presbytery is narrow. The presbytery, east oriented, is a little older than the nave ( dating from the 14th century), and it has two cross vault bays. In each bay where the fins cross, there is a round, evenly carved keystone; one with a smoot coat of arms, another with a double cross symbolic of the Holy Sepulcher order. In the bay closer to the nave on its opposite walls you can notice some semicircular niches divided by three ogival arcades, once used by the monks as their seats (sedilla). There is a niche vaulted with a gothic arch in the second bay, placed in the southern wall. Opposite in the northern wall, a niche for a tabernacle with new-stone setting can be observed. The wall paintings in the presbytery are gothic polychrome dating from second half of the 14th century was painted on the thin layer of whitewash with the use of “al secco” technique. All painting decorations belong to a homogenous system which is based on a precise use of areas being determined by the architecture of individual walls and vault areas whilst the rule of symmetry is consequently being followed in the composition structure. The polychrome does not dominate the architecture of the interior. On the contrary, the paintings accentuate the architecture by emphasizing the constructional elements, as well as framing the niches and windows with geometrical ornament, which frames the area for the numerous figural compositions on the walls, which follow a zonal pattern. Two tiers are covered with scenes from the lives of Christ, God’s Mother, St. John the Baptist and figures of Saints. On the wall of the rood screen arch we can admire Mother of Mercy, who covers the inhabitants of the town and Monks of the Holy Sepulcher Order with her coat, as well as St. Christopher. The vault areas with their plain surface, framed with yellow strips along its fins, make a good background for 18 heads of kings and Old Testament prophets, supernatural in size, set on their busts. The nave  The nave was erected in second half of 14th century. Its constructional elements (fins, keystones, cantilevers, window frames) were made of artificial stone. It is a bit higher and wider that the presbytery and has four bays. From the western side there is a quadrilateral tower with a sacristy in the ground floor. Bell Tower  The quadrilateral tower – There is small circular window with stone four–leaf open work on the northern part of its ground floor. We can see windows and round or ogival blind windows on the other tiers as well. The tower has a baroque dome made from copperplate (1666) and two lanterns are attached to it. There is a ridge roof on the top covered with Roman tiles. The convent (Old Monastery)  The convent adjacent to the church was built of bricks and plastered and its structure is partly gothic. The building is two stories high with a basement below. It was built in the gothic style, however later some baroque decorations were added. On the first floor there is a passage which joins the convent and the church. The convent was partly rebuilt at the end of 17th century.  Current times  The paintings were restored in 2019. The monastery is private property and receives no funding from the diocese.

The group was founded in November of 2012 by Nets fan and Brooklyn native Udong \\"Bobby\\" Edemeka. The Brooklyn Brigade can be found on Section 114 of Barclays Center during all Nets home games. The Brigade is often spotlighted on the Jumbotron before the tip off of the game and at various times during the game. During the opposing team starting 5 announcements, the Brigade loudly chant \\"Brooklyn\\" to drown out the announcement of the names. During the 2018-2019 season, the Nets carved out Section 114 for passionate fans called The BK Block. Although the Brigade is an independent fan group of the Nets, The Block is composed mostly of Brigade members.  History  In November 2012, the Brooklyn Nets were beginning their new season since making the transition to the Barclays Center from Prudential Center where they played from 2010-2012. During this time, Bobby attended a few early season games of the new Brooklyn team. At this time, the Nets were seen as an expansion team by the league and fans alike. Bobby noticed that the team lacked a solid fanbase in their new home, and knowing how passionate the Nets fans from the Meadowlands were, he decided to purchase tickets for a small group of roughly 20 fans who he noticed were regular followers of the team on the SB Nation online blog NetsDaily. The first game that the group attended was against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Brigade at this time was not relegated to Section 114. Instead, Bobby would purchase tickets in whichever section he could, which often included nosebleed seats. The Brigade initially did not get much recognition from the Nets. Bobby met with then CEO of ONEXIM Group (which owned the Nets until 2019) Irina Pavlova who was fond of the group's fanatics. Although Pavlova was a supporter of the group, other members of the organization were not initially on board with the Brigade. During the 2014-2015 NBA season, the Brooklyn Nets began assigning seats to the Brigade on Section 114 of Barclays Center. This section is adjacent to the press booth and gave the Brooklyn Brigade exposure on a regional level and then eventually on a national level. During the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals in 2014, while the Nets battled the Miami Heat, Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center CEO Brett Yomark noticed the effect that the Brigade had on the arena and he started to visit Section 114 and distributing Nets' apparel. IN 2016, the Brooklyn Nets hired Sean Marks as their general manager. Marks was an immediate supporter of the group and personally introduced the Brigade to then Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. Beginning in the 2018-2019 NBA Season, the Brooklyn Brigade members as well as members of the Nets fanbase were invited to audition for free season passes for Section 114. The Nets also began providing head cutouts of Nets players and YES Network personalities.  NBA Bubble  During the 2019-2020 NBA Season, the NBA was forced to move the games to ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Brooklyn Brigade members of The BK Block were invited to cheer for the team virtually using Microsoft Teams. The Brigade members attended all Nets \\"home games\\" during the NBA bubble including \\"home games\\" during the round 1 matchup against the Toronto Raptors for the playoffs.

It was possibly painted in the 1620s, and is currently housed at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Subject In Greek mythology, Icarus succeeded in flying, while attempting to escape from Crete, with wings made by his father Daedalus, using feathers secured with beeswax. Dedalus asked icarus to fly neither too low nor too high, warning him of hubris. Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax. He fell into the sea and drowned. Painting The painting was taken to Stockholm as booty in 1648. To the left, several ships are sailing, coasting steep cliffs. Tall and leafy trees frame the painting to the right; a seaside town stretches in the middle, overhung by fabulous cliffs, which are typical of de Momper and his group of Flemish landscapists. In the trees' shadow there sits a shepherd, tending to his flock. There is a fisherman to the left, and a ploughman on their right. These three figures (ploughman, shepherd and angler) are mentioned in Ovid's account of the legend. In the Roman poet's version, they are: \\"astonished and think to see gods approaching them through the aether.\\" In contrast to this, there is a Flemish proverb that goes \\"And the farmer continued to plough...\\" (En de boer ... hij ploegde voort) pointing out the ignorance of people to fellow men's suffering. The painting was inspired by Bruegel's oeuvre of the same name. In de Momper's version, too, the three figures appear to pay no attention to flying men, mistakable for gods. As regards Bruegel's painting, it has been suggested by W. H. Auden in his 1938 poem, that it depicts humankind's indifference to suffering by highlighting the ordinary events which continue to occur, despite the unobserved death of Icarus.

In 1989, it merged with American publisher Malibu Comics, becoming the Adventure Comics imprint.  Company history  Founded in May 1986 by Steve Milo, the company was named for its first book, The Adventurers, initially published by Canadian comics publisher Aircel. After the first two issues, Adventure Publications began publishing independently with a second printing of the first two issues, now cover titled simply Adventurers (though the indicia would retain The Adventurers usage through issue five). By March 1988, the company had five titles (Adventurers, Elf Warrior, Ninja Elite, Star Rangers, and Warriors) and had grown to the seventh largest of the approximately one-hundred comic publishers in the US. In January of 1989, Adventure Publications was acquired by American publisher Malibu Comics, which had previously acquired Aircel in October 1988. It continued as the Adventure Comics imprint of Malibu until 1993.

He trained in Paris, at the Laloux-Lemaresquier atelier, and later received a scholarship from the National Board of Education and the Institute for High Culture.  Biography  He passed the Entrance Exam for the Ecole des Beaux- Arts in Paris and also enrolled at the Institute of Urbanism, University of Paris. In 1939 he completed the courses of Architecture and Urbanism in those institutions, having obtained the Diploma of Special Studies in Urbanism and the French Government's Architecture Diploma (ADGF). His thesis, written in French, was entitled 'Les villes qui meurent sans se dépeupler' [Cities that die without being depopulated]. He was a student of, among others, Charles Lemaresquier, Jacques Gréber (author of the plans for the Casa de Serralves Gardens in Porto), Louis Bonnier and Picard. At the Porto School of Fine Arts he was professor of the 16th chair from 1946 to 1957, and interim professor of Group 20 at the same School, having participated in 1962 in the public competition for the provision of a teaching post for Group 20 (Urbanology), then obtaining the title of Professor Aggregate. In 1943 he married the architect Maria José Marques da Silva, daughter of the renowned Porto architect, José Marques da Silva. They left for Angola and worked there with the French urbanist Étienne de Gröer on the preparation of the first urbanisation plan for the city of Luanda, following an identical and prior collaboration on the urbanisation plan for Coimbra. With Faria da Costa of Lisbon, he was one of the first Portuguese urbanists to complete the urbanisation plans for Moledo do Minho, Águeda, Paredes, Matosinhos, Aveiro, Barcelos, Elvas, Valongo, Guimarães and Chaves. Some of these works were realised in partnership with his wife, the architect Maria José Marques da Silva, including important works of architecture, some highlights in Porto being the design and direction of works for the Palácio do Comércio (a large block between the streets of Sá da Bandeira and Fernandes Tomás), the Trabalho e Reforma building (in the Rua Nossa Senhora de Fátima), the residential tower block of the Stonemasons' Cooperative and the Torre Miradouro (in the Rua da Alegria), and the churchyard and pinnacle of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (in the Praça Marquês de Pombal). He also worked with his wife to complete a number of unfinished Marques da Silva projects, for example a new building for the Sociedade Martins Sarmento, the municipal market, the Penha Sanctuary and São Torcato Church, all in Guimarães, and a building in Rua Barjona de Freitas, Barcelos. Of particular importance in Porto was the Monument to the Heroes of the Peninsular War, popularly known as the Boavista Monument, designed by Marques da Silva in 1909, delayed by two World Wars, completed in 1951 and finally unveiled in 1952. On 26 October 1984, he was awarded the Commander of the Order of the Infante D. Henrique.

He gained popularity as a story-teller through his job in Radio Tehran. Sobhi authored two autobiographies (Kitab-i Sobhi and Payam-i Pidar) that also explains in detail his life as a missionary of the Baháʼí Faith and a secretary of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the hardships he endured and what he witnessed that ultimately led him to turn away from Baháʼí.  Early Life  According to his autobiography Payam-i Pidar, Sobhi was born in Tehran and his father who was originally from Kashan had remarried a few times. His life took a turn for the worse after his father divorced his mother at the age of six (p. 5-6) and he was continuously harassed by his stepmother. His mother passed away when he was eleven (p. 8). At the age of six, his first teacher was a Baháʼí woman by the name of Aghabaygum who taught him to read. However after threatening to beat him, he was transferred the to the Tarbiyat School to continue his primary education (p. 10). He attended the Tarbiyat School for a few years. Finally, due to the constant harassment from his stepmother, he was sent to Qazvin by his father and after a few months set on to a missionary journey that led through Azerbaijan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan (pp. 13-44). After returning to Tehran in 1918 by the insistence of his father, he started a career as a teacher at the Tarbiyat School of Tehran. When the first World War ended, he set off with a number other Baháʼís to visit the Holy land. (p. 45). In 1919, he reached Haifa, Palestine to meet 'Abdu'l Baha, the second leader of the Baháʼí Faith who appointed him as his secretary for two years. A few years after returning to Tehran, he was excommunicated from the Baháʼí and was forced to leave his father's home due to constant threats he and his father received from the Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of Iran. For two months, he lived on the streets and would eat whatever scraps of leftover food he could find, until one of his former teachers hired a room for him to live in (pp. 113-116). He describes this situation in this manner: \\"You have no idea what this group (the Baháʼís) did to me. I didn't have a place to relax in. I didn't have a loaf of bread to fill my stomach. I didn't have any clothes to protect myself from the cold and the heat. Nor a corner that (I could hide) so as to not see them or hear their tongue lashings.\\" (p. 117).  Career  As Sobhi himself states, wherever he would apply for work the Baháʼís would tell his employers that this man is unworthy and dishonorable, until finally he started workings as a teacher in the Sadat School of Sayyid Yahya Dawlatabadi (a prominent political activist and Azali by faith) and sometime later he started teaching at the American High School in Tehran, Iran (p. 120). In 1933, he started work at the Higher Academy of Music (Honarestān-e ʿāli-e musiqi) in Tehran where he taught Persian language and literature. Even here the non-stop harassment from Baháʼís continued and he wrote his first autobiography and refutation of the Baháʼíi faith called Kitab-i Sobhi. This book considerably reduced the harassment. (p. 122). When Radio broadcasting was started in Iran, the section on music and children was delegated to the Higher Academy of Music (Honarestān-e ʿāli-e musiqi) where Sobhi was employed and the children's section was immediately put in the hands of Sobhi (p. 122). Thus in April of 1940, he joined Radio Tehran as a story- teller and started broadcasting his children' story program. He had a vast collection of stories from different cultures. He was specialized in comparing Iranian version of stories with other versions such as Aryan stories, from Tajikistan, Afghanistan and India. His program became very popular, especially among children. He continued this job for 22 years. He is known to be one of the most well-known radio personalities in Iran. Also for a brief time in 1937-38, he taught at the Law College (Dāneškada-ye ḥoquq).  Connection with the Baháʼí Faith  َAccording to Sobhi's autobiography, his paternal grandfather was a Muslim scholar from Kashan by the name of Haj Mulla Ali Akbar. His wife was secretly a Babi that had converted her children to Babism then Baháʼísm and Sobhi was born into the Baháʼí Faith. This grandmother was the aunt of Baha'u'llah's third wife, Gawhar. Subhi's mother was from a Muslim Family and secretly a Baháʼí too. She was in a bigamist relationship with Sobhi's father. While a pupil at the Tarbiyat school, he would attend Baháʼí classes in his free time under the supervision of a number of prominent Baháʼí teachers. He would debate with Muslims and was even punished a number of times at school for engaging in similar discussions (pp. 13-44). In 1916–17, he went to Caucasus as a Baháʼí missionary. He returned back to Iran in 1918. In 1919, he traveled to Haifa, Palestine to meet 'Abdu'l Baha, the second leader of the Baháʼí Faith, who appointed him as his secretary for two years. According to Sobhi \\"We were promised the finest of spiritual foods in the Baháʼí faith, but we came away hungry.\\" As he mentions throughout his book, Sobhi states that he had witnessed many immoral acts from the Baháʼí community and missionaries in both in Iran and abroad and these always irritated him. However, they were never a cause of doubt for him for he was always told these are tests from God (p. 15). His first real doubts started after seeing 'Abdu'l-Baha for the first time and realizing that he was nothing like how he was described by Baha'i missionaries (p. 48-50). Finally after seeing how Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí was treated by 'Abdu'l-Baha and his followers he devised a plan to extend his 19 day stay in Haifa to investigate the truth, and presented 'Abdu'l-Baha with his writing skills. 'Abdu'l-Baha immediately asked him to stay as his secretary (pp. 66-68). He recounts many things that troubled him in Palestine. 'Abdu'l-Baha posing as a Hanafi Sunni and attending the Friday prayers at the Muslim mosque and denying he was part of a new religion (p. 52 and 90), accepting Knighthood from the British crown while a number of Muslims had rejected it at the same time (p. 80), 'Abdu'l-Baha's close relatives indulged in leisure and living off the money sent by Baháʼís from abroad (p. 82 and 91), bias and discrimination in favor of western pilgrims over Iranian pilgrims (p. 98) and 'Abdu'l-Baha's constant belittling of the people of Iran in his letters to the western Baháʼís (p. 99). Having socialized with Shoghi Effendi for two years while he was a secretary of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Sobhi could not accept that Shoghi had taken the reigns of the Baháʼí community that came as a complete surprise to many who closely knew him (p. 104). He recounts in many places of his book what he had witnessed from Shoghi including his constant bad-mouthing and cold behavior towards his closest family members (pp. 125-127), his inclination toward homosexuality (p. 84), and spending the money sent by Baháʼís to the Holy Land without the consent of 'Abdu'l-Baha (including a large sum of money that he had taken from Ruth White ) that had ultimately led to 'Abdu'l-Baha losing trust in him in the last years of his life (p. 129). Sobhi's strong opposition to Shoghi Effendi’s appointment as a Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith was reported to Shoghi Effendi. In a letter dated 19 October 1927 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of Iran, Shoghi Effendi wrote that Sobhi and his kind who are found to be engaging in satanic whispers, should be encouraged to return to the Baháʼí way, and if they decline they would be excommunicated and it would be forbidden for all Baháʼís to socialize or speak with them. Finally, In 1928, the Baháʼí council in Iran expelled him from the Baháʼí community.  Death  Sobhi did not marry, he lived a simple life, alone. He died of larynx cancer in 1962. He was buried in the Zahir-od-dowleh cemetery in Tehran.  Works  Sobhi's works can be divided in two categories. The first are autobiographies that he wrote to refute the Baháʼí Faith and his reason for leaving it. He published two books: * Kitab-i Sobhi (The Book of Sobhi) : His first book refuting the Baháʼí Faith, 1933. * Payam-i Pidar (The Father's Message): A continuation of His first book for rejection of the Baháʼí Faith, 1956. He states in the introduction of this book that the first book is inadequate in responding to the many questions that his audience have and he has written this book to respond to these questions. The second category included collections of folk- lore and fairy tales. The following list enumerates a number of these works: * Afsaneha (Fairy Tales): A collection of Persian stories and fairy tales, Two volumes, 1946. * Afsanehay-i Kuhan (Ancient Fairy Tales): A collection of stories, 1949. * Dastanha-i Melal (Stories of the Nations): َ A collection of stories from different countries such as Iran, Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Denmark, 1948. * Amoo Nawrooz (Uncle Nawrooz): A collection of 26 Short stories in Persian. One of the stories called the Legend of Uncle Nawrooz narrates the story of Uncle Nawrooz who is the symbol of spring and a new year. * Deje Hoosh Roba (The Mind Stealing Castle): Story of three men who set on a journey to win a Chinese princess's hand in marriage. The story is based on a poem with the same name from the Persian Poet Rumi. * Hajj Mirza Zulfali: 1947. * Dastanhay-i Divan-i Balkh (Stories from the Courthouse of Balkh): The story of a corrupt judge working in the courthouse of Balkh who tries to kill a girl that he has fallen in love with but refuses to marry him. * Afsanehay-i Bastani Iran wa Majar (Ancient Iranian and Hungarian Fairy Tales): A collection of nineteen stories, 1943.

They have released twelve albums and toured both nationally and internationally. Foundation Eight to the Bar was founded by keyboardist, vocalist, and songwriter Cynthia Lyon and pedal steel guitar player John Brown in 1975 in New Haven, Connecticut as a Western-style swing band. The original lineup had eight members, male vocalist Rob Jockel, and Lyon singing lead and backup vocals with her sisters Todd and Barbara Lyon, bassist Tom McNamara, John Brown on pedal steel, drummer John Baker, and guitarist Matt Simpson.Jon Davis. ”Swing that Country Music”. The Advocate. April 6, 1977. Page 24.fs It eventually became a seven-piece band, and finally a six-piece band for most of its existence. The music in its early days has been described as “steel guitar-laced sound of old-school swing”, though within a few years they replaced the pedal steel guitar with a saxophone. Its sound evolved to be described as a blend of swing, boogie-woogie, blues, and Motown. They performed both covers and original material. After several lineup changes, the original band broke up ten years later when Lyon had tired of touring—however they were reassembled less than a year later. Reformation Eight to the Bar reconstituted its lineup upon reformation, with the only original member being Lyon. The lineup continued to change, and in 2005 three different previous lineups reunited in order to play the band’s thirtieth anniversary concert. Touring The band has toured throughout New England, with regular shows in each state, in addition to both the east and west cost of the US and international tour dates. Among the concerts, they have opened for groups and artists including Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Manhattan Transfer, Robert Cray, Roy Orbison, and Ray Charles. They have also served as a local band on demand, performing at weddings in addition to their concert hall performances. In 2010 reporter Jay Miller wrote of their touring that \\"the band is nationally known and frequently tours overseas, but also stays busy with a variety of gigs from weddings to corporate parties to clubs to town concerts in the summer\\". Another reporter wrote that same year that, \\"Everyone in Connecticut knows ETTB, either because they played at their own wedding or their best friend's wedding or they saw them play a gig as far away as the Caribbean or as close as The Chowder Pot in Branford.\\" By the 2010s, they were still performing up to 200 concert dates per year. Recordings The band’s first album was The Joint Is Jumpin, which they recorded in 1981 at Toad's Place in New Haven. This was followed by Swingin' School in 1984. After their hiatus, they released their third album, Redheads of Rhythm, in 1989. This was followed by their 1993 album Something Old, Something New, Something Rhythm, Something Blues, Beat Me Rocking in 1996, the album Hey Sailor! in 2001, Superhero Swinger Undercover in 2003, and You Call This Swing? in 2005.https://www.discogs.com/artist/1410059-Eight-To-The-Bar Their album Calling All Ickeroos was released in 2007, followed by their 2010 album The Romper Room. Upon the band’s fortieth anniversary in 2015 it released its twelfth album, entitled Bring It & Swing It!. At this stage the longest serving members other than Lyon had been involved since 1989—saxophonist Collin Tilton and bass player/vocalist Mike Corsini. Lyon’s husband, Collin Tilton, has also recorded and toured with Van Morrison and Etta James.

After finishing races, the player earns money, which can be used to upgrade the player's vehicles. The game features 80 tracks and 12 vehicles. The game also features a \\"Career mode\\". When playing single-player, the player races against AIs.  Development and release  Monochrome Racing is based on the mode Head-To-Head from the 1994 game Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament.

Completed and commissioned in December 1943, she served in World War II and was sunk in February 1945 during her fifth war patrol.

The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 187 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor.Chesneau, p. 203 They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-43 was laid down as Submarine No. 209 on 6 October 1942 by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at Kobe, Japan. She was launched on 5 June 1943 and was renamed Ro-43 that day. She was completed and commissioned on 16 December 1943. Service history =March–June 1944= Upon commissioning, Ro-43 was attached to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. On 10 March 1944, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet. On 11 March 1944, Ro-43 departed Kure, Japan, bound for Truk. While at sea on 19 March 1943, she received orders to intercept an Allied task force off Truk, but that day a malfunctioning valve caused a compressed-air explosion which wrecked one of her ballast tanks on her starboard side. She reported that she was experiencing flooding and was unable to dive, and she requested permission to proceed to Truk, which she reached on 29 March 1944. On 31 March 1944 she got back underway for Maizuru, where she arrived on 9 April 1944. She began an overhaul and repairs there. After completion of the work, Ro-43 departed Maizuru on 4 June 1944. She arrived at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 10 June 1944. =First war patrol= Ro-43 got underway from Saipan on 11 June 1944 to begin her first war patrol, ordered to operate as part of a submarine patrol line off the Marianas. On 13 June 1944 the Combined Fleet activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands, and that day the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, ordered all available Japanese submarines including Ro-43 to deploy east of the Marianas. The Battle of Saipan began with U.S. landings on Saipan on 15 June 1944, and on 16 June 1944, Ro-43 was assigned to Submarine Group B and ordered to operate as part of a patrol line southeast of the Marianas. Ro-43 was on the surface off Rota on 16 June 1944 proceeding to her new operating area when a United States Navy destroyer surprised her and opened gunfire on her at 21:44. After she submerged, the destroyer continued its attack with depth charges. Ro-43 escaped, but not before diving so far below her designed depth limit that she suffered severe structural damage, rendering her unable to continue her patrol. Her commanding officer reported this to 6th Fleet headquarters on 18 June 1944 and received orders on 21 June 1944 to return to Japan. She reached Maizuru on 26 June 1944 for refit and overhaul, later moving to Kure. Based on the damage Ro-43 suffered in escaping the destroyer, the Japanese Ministry of the Navy later issued orders that no submarine was to dive to a depth greater than 1.3 times her designed depth limit. =Second war patrol= With her repairs and overhaul complete, Ro-43 set out from Kure on 17 September 1944 to begin her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area southeast of Palau. Her patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Kure on 14 October 1944. =Third war patrol= On 13 October 1944, the day before Ro-43′s arrival at Kure, the Combined Fleet activated Operation Shō-Gō 1 for the defense of the Philippine Islands. Accordingly, Ro-43 got back underway from Kure on 19 October 1944 to operate as part of Submarine Group B, assigned a patrol area in the Philippine Sea east of the Philippines. The Philippines campaign and the Battle of Leyte began with the U.S. landings on Leyte on 20 October 1944, and the Japanese naval reaction to the invasion resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23–26 October 1944. Ro-43 saw no action during the battle, but on 31 October 1944 she and the submarine received orders to patrol in the San Bernardino Strait between Luzon and Samar and report and attack any Allied forces attempting to interfere with Japanese convoys bringing supplies and reinforcements from Manila to Leyte. Ro-43 encountered no Allied forces. She received orders on 8 November 1944 to return to Japan, and she arrived at Sasebo on 16 November 1944. =Fourth war patrol= On 8 December 1944, Ro-43 put to sea from Sasebo for her fourth war patrol, with a patrol area in the Philippine Sea east of Luzon. After an uneventful patrol, she received orders on 27 December 1944 to return to Japan. She arrived at Kure on 4 January 1945. =Fifth war patrol= By 13 February 1945, Ro-43 was preparing to depart Kure on 14 February to carry a cargo of Type 97 torpedoes to a midget submarine unit based on Cebu in the Philippine Islands, but the voyage was cancelled that day due to Allied activities in the Okinawa area. Instead, she departed Kure on 16 February 1945 to conduct her fifth war patrol, bound for an operating area east of Okinawa. On 17 February 1945, she received orders to patrol east of Iwo Jima. The Battle of Iwo Jima began on 19 February 1945 with U.S. landings on the island. =Loss= On 25 February 1945, the destroyer detected a submerged submarine on sonar off the Volcano Islands. The nearby escort aircraft carrier launched a radar-equipped TBM Avenger torpedo bomber of Composite Squadron 82 (VC-82) to search for the submarine. Early on 26 February, she launched another Avenger, which picked up a surface contact at 02:20. As the Avenger flew over the contact, its pilot sighted a submerging submarine. The Avenger dropped two sonobuoys and a Mark 24 \\"Fido\\" acoustic homing torpedo which sank the submarine at . By dawn on 27 February 1945, a large oil slick covered the area. The submarine the Avenger sank probably was Ro-43, which became the first Japanese submarine lost during the Battle of Iwo Jima. On 14 March 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared her to be presumed lost off Iwo Jima with the loss of all 79 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 April 1945.

Early career  Alexander Slepkov was born in Ryazan province, in Russia, one of six children. His father, Nikolai, was a peasant's son, who completed high school and became a teacher, and later a beekeeper. In his teens, he may have been a supporter of the Kadets, a liberal pro-monarchist party, before he, and his father, joined the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in the town of Ludza, in Latvia, where Nikolai was elected the town's first commissar for education, and Alexander was elected the first commissar for justice. When the German army occupied Lativa, both were arrested and sentenced to death, but they were released by local population when the Germans withdrew. Alexander Slepkov graduated from Sverdlov University in 1921, and from the Institute of Red Professors in 1924. While at the Institute, he became a leading member of the 'Bukharin School' - a group of young party intellectuals who looked to Nikolai Bukharin, rather than Joseph Stalin, as their mentor. In September 1924 he was appointed an editor of the authoritative journal Bolshevik, and later also an editor of Pravda. He was also recruited by Bukharin to work for the political secretariat of Comintern. In 1925-28, he was chief editor of Komsomolskaya Pravda. A prolific writer, he wrote numerous pieces attacking the left opposition, led by Leon Trotsky, but from about May 1928, he followed Bukharin in opposing the methods used to force peasants to hand over grain to the state, and the drive towards rapid industrialisation. In June, he was embroiled in a public argument over an article published in Bolshevik with Stalin's right hand man, Vyacheslav Molotov, who accused Slepkov of lying. In June 1928, Bukharin sent him to Leningrad to help organise the opposition there. In August or September 1928, he was dismissed from the staff of Pravda and Bolshevik and posted to Samara, as head of Agitprop for the Central Volga regional communist party. In 1932, he was transfered to an academic post in Rostov-on-Don.  The Ryutin Affair  Around 1932, Slepkov and the Old Bolshevik Martemyan Ryutin formed a conspiratorial group who called themselves the 'Union of Marxist-Leninists', but was known in the Stalinist press as the 'Ryutin-Slepkov Group', who distributed an almost book-length manifesto, written by Ryutin, attacking Stalin over the brutal treatment of the USSR's rural population. After the group was betrayed to the OGPU, Slepkov was arrested on 26 September, and sentenced to three years exile in Tara, in Siberia. He was arrested again in April 1933, accused of being leader of the \\"anti-party counter-revolutionary group of the right-wing Slepkov and others\\". On 16 April, he was sentenced to five years in prison, which he served in Verkhneuralsk, in Chelyabinsk region. Thirty three members of this supposed organisation were sentenced to prison terms on the same day.  Death  Slepkov was brought back to Moscow for interrogation after the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1936, and executed on 26 May 1937. His name was mentioned repeatedly during the last of the Moscow Show Trials, in March 1938, at which Bukharin, the main defendant, 'confessed' that he had dispatched Slepkov to the Kuban in 1932 \\"to prepare a kulak revolt.\\". Bukharin's widow said, in her memoirs, that she was \\"surprised by Bukharin's forced admission that he had sent his former protégé Alexandr Slepkov to the North Caucasus to organise a kulak uprising there. On the contrary, I knew very well that Nikolai Ivanovich's protégés, Slepkov among them, had been sent by Stalin to the provinces in order to isolate him, which made him very sad.\\" Slepkov was 'rehabilitated' in June 1988. His party membership was posthumously restored in 1989.  Personality  In 1970, a memoir written by a former political prisoner was smuggled out of the USSR and published in Paris, and later translated to English. The writer said he had shared a cell with Slepkov in summer 1933. He wrote: This memoir has to be treated with caution, because \\"the text is disjointed and contains quite a few erroneous or even bizarre statements.\\" The writer claimed that Slepkov committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell, to avoid incriminating himself under torture, though most sources say that he was shot.  Family  Slepkov's younger brother, Vasili Nikolaevich Slepkov (1902-1937) also studied at the Institute of Red Professors after graduating from Leningrad Univerity, and then worked in the genetics laboratory of the Moscow Zootechnical Institute. In the second half of the 1920s, he studied in Germany with the geneticist Curt Stern. On his return, in August 1927, he enrolled in Kazan University, as a philosophy lecturer at the Tatar Communist University. In November 1930, he was expelled from the communist party and banned from teaching, as a suspected supporter of Bukharin. After an investigation, he was allowed to resume teaching, and in September 1930 resumed work as Kazan University first ever lecturer in genetics, In 1932, he was appointed Director of the university's Biological Institute, and reinstated in the communist party. Arrested in 1933, he denied all knowledge of the Ryutin Affair, or his brother's political activities, but was convicted and sentenced to three years in the political isolator in Suzdal He was released in June 1934, and exiled to Ufa. When his term of exile ended, he moved to Baku, where he was arrested again on 14 January 1937, and taken back to Kazan, and accused of heading a terrorist group, which included a large number of his colleagues and past and former students. One of those arrested Yevgenia Ginzburg, who survived years in the gulag, heard from a fellow prisoner, an ethnic Tatar, that Slepkov gave his interrogators the confession they wanted, and provided the NKVD with more than 150 names of people he claimed to have 'recruited' to a fictitious underground terrorist organisation in Kazan, capital of Tatarstan. A woman he had named, when confronted by him in prison, called him a liar, to which he is said to have responded \\"We must disarm! We must go on our knees to the party.\\" Ginzburg wrote: This passage is sometimes mistakenly cited as referring to Alexander Slepkov. Vasili Slepkov was sentenced to death on 1 August 1937, and shot the same day. His widow, Yevgenya, survived ten years in prison and the gulag. He was 'rehabilitated' in December 1957. A third brother, Vladimir Nikolaevich Slepkov (1907-1937), worked as a journalist on the science magazine 'Young Proletarian'. He also supported the opposition, like his brother, and was expelled from the Communist Party in 1933. In 1935, he was arrested and sentenced to four years exile in Surgat, in Siberia, where he worked a s a statistician for the forestry commission. Arrested again on 1 September 1936, he was transfered to Moscow, accused of being a member of the same terrorist group as his brothers, and shot on 3 August 1937. He was rehabilitated in 1957. All three of their sisters were also arrested. One, Anastasia (born 1901), was shot. The others, Sophia and Zhenya, survived years of imprisonment.

The festival is hosted by a number of indigenous communities adjacent to the lake, and is meant to promote peace, cultural exchange, and tourism. The El Molo people host the festival in Loiyangalani every June, and the Turkana people host the festival in Lodwar in April. The Tobong’u Lore is considered among the largest of cultural festivals in Kenya, and has become a venue for appearances by prominent Kenyan politicians. Scope The festival in Loiyangalani was first held in 2008 as a mechanism of promoting peace and cooperation among the communities that border Lake Turkana. In Lodwar, the festival began being held in 2014. Participating communities, which extend across national borders, include the Turkana, the Dassanech, the Samburu, the Somali, the Borana, the Gabbra, the Rendille, the Sakuye, the Wata, the Burji, the Garee, the Konso, and the El Molo people. The festival's creation was supported by the National Museums of Kenya and the German Government, and coincided with the opening of a museum in the town. The festival attracts thousands of visitors every year. Some visitors are from countries that border Kenya, including Ethiopia, Sudan, and Uganda. A delegation from Nigeria has also attended. Turkana County officials state that the festival is intended in part to promote tourism and development. The Tobong’u Lore is one of a number of initiatives advanced by the Kenyan government to promote cultural tourism and preserve local culture among smaller ethnic groups in Kenya. The phrase \\"Tobong’u Lore\\" is described as meaning \\"welcome back home\\" in the Turkana language. The phrase is a reference to the archaeological and paleontological heritage of the Turkana Basin. In 2019 Turkana officials reduced spending on the festival from 70 million Kenyan Shillings to 33, diverting funds to address a local drought crisis. Activities A woman from the El Molo community, which has helped host Tobong’u Lore cultural festivals around Lake Turkana. The festival features local culture, nature, and archeological heritage. Participants wear traditional attire during ceremonies. Activities include a three-day carnival, with music and dance from local groups, and speeches by local leaders. Consistent with local customs, the festivities continue after sundown. Exhibitions promote local crafts and food. The protection of wildlife is another theme addressed by the festival. Political appearances Many Kenyan officials have attended the festival, and some politicians have used the event to make announcements related to political campaigns or policies. In 2019 the festival was attended by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and by the Deputy President William Ruto; in 2020 Governor Kivutha Kibwana used the festival as a venue to announce his bid for the presidency in upcoming elections.

This medium-sized omnivorous cynognathian provides important information on the dental evolution of early diverging gomphodonts and traversodontids. Discovery and etymology Etjoia was discovered in the upper beds of the Omingonde Formation of Namibia (dated to the Ladinian to Carnian) by American paleontologist Charles Schaff in 1996. The specimen was unearthed on the south-eastern side of the Etjo Mountain, in the Waterberg Basin of the Otjozondjupa region, in central north-west Namibia. The holotype is deposited in the Geological Survey of Namibia of Windhoek with the specimen number GSN F1591. The generic name refers to Mount Etjo from which the new genus was unearthed. The type species, E. dentitransitus, refers to the possession of a transitional dentition with sub-circular upper postcanines and a large number of sectorial teeth representing the diademodontid/trirachodontid postcanine pattern, and with sub-rectangular lower postcanines with a mesially positioned transverse crest, which is the classical morphology of lower traversodontid postcanines. Description Etjoia is a medium-sized non-strictly herbivorous gomphodont represented by an almost complete skull and a few cervical vertebrae. It was estimated to have a body length ranging from 40 to 55 cm and a body mass of 3.2 kg. This cynodont mainly differs from other gomphodonts by the morphology of its gomphodont postcanines and the high number of its sectorial teeth. =Skull= right The cranial material of Etjoia consists of an almost complete skull only missing the right zygoma. The cranium, which has a basal skull length of 88.5 mm, is characterized by the absence of a labial shelf in the maxilla. =Dentition= The dentition comprises four upper and three lower incisors, one upper and one lower canine, and nine upper and eight to nine lower postcanines. The lower incisors bear large apically inclined denticles whereas the upper incisors only have minute denticles. Longitudinal ridges are present in the upper canines. Both upper and lower postcanine teeth include one conical, four gomphodont, and four sectorial postcanines, which is the highest number of sectorial teeth among all traversodontids. Unlike other gomphodonts, the upper gomphodont postcanines are subcircular to elliptical whereas the lower gomphodont teeth are subrectangular and mesiodistally (anteroposteriorly) elongated. The third lower gomphodont postcanine has the particularity of having a low ridge (known as a mesial cingulum) anterior to the prominent transverse crest. The last upper sectorial postcanines are also strongly offset lingually (medially). =Postcranial skeleton= The postcranial skeleton is only represented by the first five cervical vertebrae.  Environment  The environment in which Etjoia was living in was characterized by meandering streams on a semi-arid loessic floodplain with shallow saline lakes. The floodplain was subject to short, wet winters with heavy thunderstorms followed by long, warm, and dry summers during which dust storms occurred frequently. Etjoia was coexisting with small herbivorous kannemeyeriid dicynodonts and the apex predator Cynognathus, a large carnivorous cynognathian.  Classification  Below is a cladogram from Hendrickx et al.

Its object was 'to assert and maintain the right of free discussion, and to protect and defend the victims of intolerance and bigotry'.  Formation and purpose  Described as a 'militant freethought league,' the Union came on the heels of a number of prosecutions for blasphemy. As such, its efforts were 'defensive as well as propagandistic'. Following the prosecution of Charles Southwell, and building on the 'Committee for the Protection of Mr. Southwell' established for him, The Oracle of Reason encouraged its readers to assist in the formation of a Union > whose great and glorious objects shall be to abolish all law or legal > practice which shackles expression of opinion, and to protect and indemnify > all, or whatever persuasion, whether Jew, Christian, Infidel, Atheist, or > other denomination in danger of similar tyrannies. David Nash has noted that, despite the inclusion of all denominations and none, the Union was 'clearly aimed at freethinkers'. By the Union's first meeting, at the radical John Street Institution on Tottenham Court Road, London, the prosecutions of Southwell, Holyoake, and George and Harriet Adams were discussed. The meeting's first resolution, moved by Emma Martin, expressed 'strong disapprobation of all legal interference with the free expression of opinion' and 'emphatically deprecate[d] the recent prosecutions for the alleged crime of blasphemy, as unjust and impolitic.' Martin's own atheism was infamous, causing division and disapproval among many of her own socialist associates. It was, Barbara Taylor has suggested, in part her anger at this absence of support that she and Holyoake formed the Union. The Union published its activities in The Oracle of Reason (1841-43) and The Movement and Anti-Persecution Gazette (1843-45). For four months it circulated The Monthly Circular of the Anti-Persecution Union, edited by Holyoake. Reports of the trials of Holyoake, Matilda Roalfe, Thomas Finlay, and Thomas Paterson were also published on the Union's behalf by Henry Hetherington and Paterson.  Other groups  A Scottish Anti-Persecution Union was also established, responding to prosecutions in Scotland. An appeal in The Oracle of Reason stated that the Union was: > made up of individual professors of almost every kind of opinion - > political, religious, and irreligious... [and] formed for the sole purpose > of setting free the tongue and the press; therefore, all who are persecuted > for expressing, or otherwise publishing their opinions, will have a > legitimate claim to its support. In February 1844, a Leicester Committee of the Anti-Persecution Union was formed. Its first secretary, William Henry Holyoak, had received permission the previous year, as reported in The Movement. Multiple members of the Leicester Committee were later part of the Leicester Secular Society, the world's oldest, founded in 1851.

All that remains is a farm which incorporates parts of the old castle. While not that much remains of the castle, there are a lot of recent studies about Oud Herlaer and its owners. The farm is planned to be opened as an art center in 2021. The name Oud Herlaer, ( means 'old'), signifies that later on Nieuw-Herlaer Castle was built about 1 kilometer upstream.  Location  Oud Herlaer estate Oud Herlaer is on the right bank of the Dommel. In medieval times it was in a very strategic position. The Dommel and its tributaries were practically the only way to efficiently transport bulky goods from north to south. On the other hand, the Dommel was an obstacle to east–west transport, except where there were bridges. The barrier function of the Dommel is illustrated by Oud Herlaer being within one kilometre of Maurick Castle in Vught, and actually being much closer to that place, but still belonging to the municipality of Sint- Michielsgestel. The estate immediately around Herlaer was not very large (it still measured 120 hectares in 1737). A separate study has been done on the estate. It shows the many changes in this essentially man made landscape. The map of the estate shows the grounds that were closely connected to the castle. The total possessions of the Lords of Herlaer were spread over a much wider area. The grounds were rather wet and interleaved with sand ridges. It made them only suitable for animal husbandry and digging peat. The lords of Herlaer also sold thousands of barge loads of sand. Much of this sand was used to expand the city center of 's-Hertogenbosch. Another source of income was the toll that the lords levied on traffic on the Dommel. There were probably also some watermills on the territory of Herlaer. The rise of 's-Hertogenbosch to become the second city of the Netherlands by about 1400 of course further increased the value of the estate.  Building  = The Motte and Bailey Castle = Floor plan in 1735 Oud Herlaer started out as a motte-and-bailey castle, probably already in the 11th century. This is indicated by the castle being situated on a natural sand ridge () which has been artificially heightened. I.e. on top of the sand ridge there are other sand layers which become slightly more than three meters thick in the center of the site, and are not a natural deposit. The lower layers of these could have been related to a motte castle. The diameter of the site is about 35-40 meter. It used to be connected to the nearby Dommel by two small canals which also refreshed the water in the moat. The first pictures of the castle show a building with a round or polygonal wall on the east side. The castle moat is also consistently shown to be round. Round castles generally date from the period 1150–1350. It might indicate that the motte hill, which became obsolete c 1250 was surrounded by a brick wall. After that the ground could have been leveled. Direct proof for such a supposed phase is lacking, but it was a regular pattern. The bailey or outer bailey of the motte castle has to be sought North-Northeast of the motte. An outer bailey is lacking on the old pictures of the castle. It had probably been demolished by that time, but its existence can be deduced from references to such a structure in archives. = The Medieval Castle = Oud Herlaer The first written reference to the Oud Herlaer Castle dates from when it was sold in 1315. The first depiction of the castle dates from a painting made by Pauwels van Hillegaert in 1631, depicting the 1629 siege of 's-Hertogenbosch. It shows the castle from such a distance that it's not useful. The eighteenth century pictures are better, but not conclusive. They often show a round stone ring wall with a roof. A 1735 floor plan by Hendrick van der Beck, and an etching by Hendrik Spilman show this as a more polygonal structure. 18th century drawing By the seventeenth century castle was still an archetypical medieval castle with heavy towers and very thick walls. In the northeast corner was a gate building with small overhanging towers on an upper floor. On the east side was the ring wall that was so characteristic for Oud Herlaer. Some have it as a round wall, others as a more or less polygonal wall. This will likely be decided by archaeological excavations. All drawings depict the wall with a roof, but the floor plan does not, so the roof might have been only a cover for part of the courtyard. The southeast wing probably had a basement, a ground floor, a first floor and an attic. It measured about 10.30 by 6.6 meters. On the southwest corner was the , which also had small overhanging towers. The western wall, which was part of the main building, was 25.5 m long, and had an octogonal stair tower on the courtyard side. The main floor of the main building was about 1.2 m above the courtyard. Below it was a basement. On the north west side was another structure. The ring wall was probably the oldest part of the medieval castle, dating from the thirteenth century. The castle was probably changed after the sale in 1315. A second change set of changes (small overhanging towers and the Dievetoren) can be dated to the late 14th or early 15th century. Together with some sixteenth century changes these would then have led to the castle as it appeared in the 18th century. = Farm, or cottage Out Herlaer = Oud Herlaer in 1811 It's not that clear what happened after the castle was demolished in 1737. By 1764 there was a farm on the premises, and the ruins had not yet been levied. A 1769 map shows a u-shaped farm. The 1811-1812 cadastre map of the area shows a farm building in the same position as the current farm. The presence of medieval wall fragments in the current farm suggests that parts of some of the castle walls were used to create this first farm on the premises. The map also shows the small canals which connected the Dommel to the castle moat. By 1842 a baron used the site as a summer residence, and in that year a picture was made. In 1850 this 'cottage' burned down. The current (2020) farm named Out Herlaer (with a 't') is claimed to date from the second half of the nineteenth century, but this is not certain. That is, it might be older. Nothing much happened at the site in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the second half of the twentieth century some minor structures were built on the main site, and modern stables were built on the (supposed) outer bailey. In the 1980s the surrounding moat and the small canals which refreshed it, were filled up. Meanwhile, the farm became a national monument. = Redevelopment of Oud Herlaer = In 2015 the farm was bought by Groen Ontwikkelfonds Brabant in order to preserve and promote the natural network, the main ecological structure and the ecological connection zones in the area. It led to the demolition of the modern stables on the (supposed) outer bailey. Discontinuing the farm was a simple and effective step to further these goals. A thorough archaeological reconnaissance of the terrain by BAAC Onderzoeks- en Adviesbureau was published in 2016. Based on this information the old castle moat was restored in 2017. After the basic situation had been (re)-established, the next steps were not that obvious. Groen Ontwikkelfonds decided to engage the help of public to determine these. Organizations were allowed to subscribe to buy the lands based on their plans. In 2017 the nature preservation organization Het Brabants Landschap won the tender with a plan to combine nature, art and history. Oud Herlaer will become a work- and exposition place for artists. The original structure of the castle, i.e. castle, outer bailey and orchard will be restored. Perhaps some archaeological remains will be made visible. Eco-art objects will be placed on the terrain. Around the castle the natural bed of the Dommel might be restored. A lot of connected wet and dry nature will be created. The recreational facilities in the wider area will be upgraded, and car-traffic will be discouraged. Jan Baan of Brabants Landschap was very enthusiastic about the plan. Baan stated that the remains would be made visible, and that the farm would be used for expositions. The surrounding nature would be the third pillar of the plan. He cited the jury of tender as stating that the plan had the potential of a Kröller-Müller Museum of the south. Bas Aarts, president of the society Friends of the Brabant Castles was a bit reserved. He liked the restoration of the moat and the excavations. Apart from that, he hoped that the plan would be beneficial to everybody. I.e. that visitors would be able to see what castle had been like.  History  = The Van Herlaer family (?-1315) = Old Herlaer was the center of the Lordship Herlaer. The Herlaer family held it free of feudal obligations. Cf. the inheritance via the female line. The Lords of Herlaer were also stewards of territory owned by the Abbey of Echternach and later the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. In time they acquired a lot of territory in the vicinity, or got such ecclesial territory on loan. However, ideas that the Van Herlaer's usurped ecclesial goods are probably false. From about 1080 the connection between family names and estate names became usual in the Holy Roman Empire. The name 'Van Herlaer' starts to appear in sources shortly after, often with the first name 'Dirk'. In 1173 the title 'Lord of Herlaer' () appears for the first time. It meant that the Lord of Herlaer held judicial power in the area. About 10 generations of the Van Herlaer family can be deduced from old sources. In the mid-twelfth century the Van Herlaer's became Lords of Ameide. Ameide was a loan from the Bishop of Utrecht. The Van Herlaer's then moved their seat over there. The eldest sister of the Lord of Ameide probably inherited Oud Herlaer in 1305. In 1306 she gifted it to her husband Gerard van Loon. He was the last Lord of Herlaer related to the original Herlaer's, and sold the Oud Herlaer estate in 1315. Even though the presence of the Van Herlaer's on Oud Herlaer was ended this way, the family continued to be successful. Gerard or his son would shortly after acquire a rather big continuous territory in the Bommelerwaard. Gerard's son Dirk van Herlaar (1312-1354) continued the Van Herlaer line as Lord of Ameide.() = The Van Horne and Rotselaer families (1315-1524)= In 1315 Gerard of Horne (1270-1331) bought Herlaer, bringing it into the Van Horne family. In 1316 he married his second wife Irmgard of Kleef. She owned Oud Herlaar from 1330 to 1357. Their son Dirk of Horne Lord of Perwijs and Herlaer (1320-1378) became the next Lord of Herlaer. His line would become known as that of the Lords Perwijs and Herlaer. There are conflicting reports on the Horne's of Herlaer. Jan of Horne (1395- 28 June 1447) married Maheal of Reifferscheidt in 1420. In about 1433 he inherited Herlaer from Maria of Horne. He had four children: Hendrik II, Isabel, Maria and Aleid (married to Jan of Merode). Hendrik II of Horn (c. 1422 - 22 mei 1483) would succeed his father as Lord of Perwijs and Herlaer. Probably under a usufruct for his siblings, because in 1446 there was mention of a dowry which had been possessed by Isabel. Isabel of Horne had married Jan IV of Rotselaer (?-1450/51) in 1445. (She also married Jan Pinnoc, and Jan Brant) Together they got Jan V of Rotselaer (?-1496), married to Clementina of Bouchout in 1482, and Johanna of Rotselaer. Jan V and Clementina got Hendrik van Vorsselaer and Isabella. On 13 February 1479 Jan V of Rotselaer transferred the Lordship of Herlaer and Gestel to Herman of Counen of Zegenwerp. Herman would not continue his possession of Herlaer. On 25 March 1507 Clementina of Bouchout got the (a?) usufruct on Herlaer. However, the children of Clementina died childless, and so the possession by the Van Rotselaer's ended. = The Van Merode family (1524-1662)= Hendrik of Merode was invested with the Lordship of Oud Herlaer in 1524. He was a son of Rijkalt, who was a son of Jan I of Merode and Aleit of Horne. In a conflict about the succession Hendrik of Merode had won against a number of other contestants. Hendrik married Francisca of Brederode and got Jan IV baron of Merode, Pietersheim, Perwijs and Duffel and lord of Herlaer. Jan IV married Mensia of Bergen, daughter of the Marquess of Bergen op Zoom in 1558. Their daughter Maria Margareta of Merode married Johan IV Corsselaar van Wittem (c. 1550-1588) and became Marquess of Bergen op Zoom by inheritance. She died before her father, and so her daughters inherited from her father. The title Marquess of Bergen op Zoom was a high distinction. However, in the Eighty Years' War the city of Bergen op Zoom sided with the Dutch Republic, and Jan van Wittem switched to the Spanish side in 1581. The result was that the States of Brabant made William the Silent Marquess of Bergen op Zoom. In the later stages of the Eighty Years' War the territory gradually came under complete control of the Republic, meaning that the title did not have much real value. In 1601 Herlaer was inherited by the three daughters of Johan IV Corsselaar van Wittem. In 1610 one of these daughters, Maria Margareta of Merode, called Margaretha van Wittem van Beersel (1582-1627), became sole proprietor of Oud Herlaer. In 1612 she married Count Hendrik van den Bergh, lord of Stevensweert. In 1627 her daughter Maria Elisabeth II van den Bergh (1613-1671) inherited Herlaer. It's remarkable that Oud Herlaer survived the sieges of 's-Hertogenbosch unscathed. After all, it was still a defensible point, and was very close to Den Bosch. Therefore, the defenders of 's-Hertogenbosch could have used it to delay a siege, and the besiegers could have destroyed it after one of the failed sieges. During the 1629 Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch Frederick V of the Palatinate stayed at Oud Herlaer while commander Maurice, Prince of Orange stayed at nearby Maurick Castle. After the conquest of 's-Hertogenbosch by the Dutch Republic, Count Hendrik van den Bergh changed to the Dutch side in 1632. The fact that by then Herlaar was under control of the Republic might have influenced this decision. Count Hendrik van den Bergh's surviving daughter Maria Elisabeth II van den Bergh (1613-1671), Marchioness of Bergen op Zoom inherited the Marquesat of Bergen op Zoom in 1633. She married Eitel Frederik V van Hohenzollern-Hechingen in 1641, and got only a daughter Henriette Françoise. In or before 1645 Oud Herlaer was described by Baron Philips of Leefdael as belonging to Lady ... de Berges, Princess of Hogensolre (Hohenzollern). He also stated that she owned three water mills in the area, one mill for threshing wheat, one for fulling cloth and one for processing leather. = De la Tour d'Auvergne (1662-1728) = In 1662 Henriette Françoise married Frederic Maurice de la Tour d'Auvergne Duke of Bouillon (1642-1707). (he was a son of Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duc de Bouillon (1605-1652)). They got Emanuel Maurice (Lord of Herlaer 1698-1701), and François Egon (Lord of Herlaer 1701-1710). In 1707 François Egon married Maria Anna Duchess of Aremberg and Aerschot (?-1710). They got only Marie Henriette de la Tour d'Auvergne (Lade of Herlaer 1710-1728). = Sulzbach family (1728-1798) = In 1728 Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine became Lord of Herlaer. He was succeeded by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria (1724-1799), who was lord of Herlaer from 1743 to 1798. In 1798 the Lordship of Herlaer was destroyed.
