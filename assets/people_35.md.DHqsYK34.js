Through this declaration, the British government unilaterally ended its protectorate over Egypt and granted it nominal independence with the exception of four \\"reserved\\" areas: foreign relations, communications, the military and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Background The declaration was preceded by a period of inconclusive negotiations between the Egyptian and British governments. Areas of disagreement included Egypt's position on the issues of the protectorate and of its future role in Sudan. Egyptian prime minister Adli Yakan Pasha and moderate Egyptian nationalists managed to obtain the agreement of British High Commissioner Edmund Allenby to secure the more general issue of Egypt's independence. The Coalition Government of British prime minister Lloyd George wanted to maintain the protectorate over Egypt. However, Allenby threatened to resign. His actions brought the issue of Egyptian independence to public discussion and led to a quick official response: two weeks later the declaration was issued. Although it met the Egyptian nationalists' immediate demands for an end to the protectorate, the declaration was globally unsatisfactory since it did not grant Egypt full independence. Egyptian sovereignty was greatly restricted by the \\"reserved points\\" clause. This led to sustained pressure on the United Kingdom from Egyptian nationalists to renegotiate the relationship between the two countries, which finally occurred with the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.

He bought an estate at Dorfold in the parish of Acton, near his birthplace of Nantwich in Cheshire, and he was active in charitable works locally, including founding two sets of almshouses for impoverished men. He also founded almshouses in Monken Hadley, Middlesex. Biography Townsend House (by Herbert St. John Jones in 1934) Roger Wilbraham was born in Nantwich, Cheshire in 1553, the second of four sons of Richard Wilbraham (1525‚Äì1611/12) and his first wife, Elizabeth (d. 1589/90), daughter of Thomas Maisterson.Hall, p. 437 The Wilbraham family was a junior branch of the Wilbrahams of Woodhey, who were prominent in Cheshire affairs from the 13th century onwards; Roger's daughter Elizabeth married into the senior branch of the family.Hall, pp. 424‚Äì26de Figueiredo & Treuherz, p. 77 His father served as Master of the Jewel House to Mary I and also collected revenues for the queen in the Nantwich Hundred.Garton, p. 52 In 1580 he built Townsend House on Welsh Row in Nantwich, where James I stayed during his visit to the town in 1617. His mother's family, the Maistersons, was one of the most important in Nantwich. Solicitor-General for Ireland Almshouses in Acton founded by Sir Roger Wilbraham Wilbraham was educated at Shrewsbury School and Cambridge University. He became a barrister, and was admitted to Gray's Inn in London in 1576. On 13 February 1585, he was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland, a position he held for 14 years, although he frankly admitted that he saw it as the pathway to a more senior position at the English Court. During his years in Ireland, the Irish judiciary were notorious for corruption, and for bitter feuds among themselves; shortly before his arrival in Ireland Nicholas Nugent, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, had been hanged for treason on very thin evidence, after a trial presided over by hostile colleagues. Wilbraham's attitude to judicial misconduct was cynical and pragmatic: even where a judge's conduct was disgraceful, if he gave good service to the Crown then, unless he was convicted of treason or another capital crime, he should not be treated severely, Wilbraham argued. Wilbraham himself undoubtedly gave good service to the Crown: in 1597 the Privy Council of Ireland, in a letter to Sir Robert Cecil lamenting the inefficiency of the Irish law officers (especially the recently deceased King's Serjeant Arthur Corye), exempted Wilbraham from their criticisms, as \\"he hath taken more care and pains than all the rest\\".Hart, A. R. History of the King's Serjeants at law in Ireland Four Courts Press Dublin 2000 p. 42 He did much to increase the Crown revenues, and although he made a substantial profit in the process, this was not then regarded as corruption. In 1597 a complaint was made that he was keeping all the fees for making grants on the Exchequer of Ireland for himself, rather than sharing them with the other law officers and the Remembrancer. Hart p.45 The Dublin government appears to have ignored the complaint, no doubt because of its opinion, expressed forcefully to Cecil the same year, that Wilbraham was the only one of the law officers who did his job efficiently. Hart p.42 In 1590-3, when the Attorney-General for Ireland, Sir Charles Calthorpe, was suspended from duty, Wilbraham seems to have coped efficiently with a double workload. Later career On 1 May 1600, he became the Master of Requests, a post he retained under James I, and he also served as the king's surveyor of the Court of Wards and Liveries. In his journal he commented acerbically on the added burden of work which followed James' accession, due to the flood of requests for favours. He was elected a member of parliament for Callington in 1604 and returned as knight of the shire (MP) for Cheshire in 1614. He enjoyed the patronage of Robert Cecil, who was well aware of his record of Crown service in Ireland, and that he was a reliable supporter of the Crown's policy. In the debate on the Union, he was one of the few English MPs who strongly supported the proposed Union between England and Scotland. He was prepared to give Cecil his support for his cherished project, the Great Contract (an attempt to put the Crown finances on a stable footing), but without much enthusiasm: in his journal he notes how little support there was for the Great Contract in the House of Commons, and it eventually lapsed. He received a knighthood before 1613.Latham, pp. 115‚Äì119 He kept a journal from 1593 to the end of his life: this shows him to have been a shrewd observer of the political scene, rather than a major political figure in his own right.Wilbraham, pp. 1‚Äì117 He was also active in Nantwich's salt-making industry. Family life He married Mary Baber, daughter of Edward Baber MP, of Chew Magna, Somerset, Recorder of Bath, and his wife Katherine Leigh, daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh, Lord Mayor of London, in January 1599/1600. The couple had three girls, Marie, Elizabeth and Catherine. After his death his widow remarried Sir Thomas Delves, 1st Baronet, and died in 1644. Roger purchased the Dorfold estate in the parish of Acton near Nantwich in 1602. Shortly afterwards, he gave the estate to his youngest brother, Ralph, who built the present Dorfold Hall on the site of the earlier hall in 1616‚Äì21. Chew Magna, the family home of Wilbraham's wife, Mary Baber He died on 31 July 1616 at Monken Hadley, Middlesex (now in the London Borough of Barnet), of \\"an Ague\\", an acute fever, most likely malaria. He is buried at Monken Hadley. A wall monument by Nicholas Stone commemorating Wilbraham and his family was erected in the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Monken Hadley in 1616, at a cost of ¬£80. It has busts of Wilbraham and his wife, as well as figures of their daughters. His three daughters inherited an income supposed to amount to ¬£4000 annually. Marie married Thomas Pelham, Elizabeth married her distant cousin Sir Thomas Wilbraham, 2nd Baronet, and Catherine married Sir Henry Delves, 2nd Baronet, the eldest son of her stepfather Sir Thomas by his first wife.Wilbraham, note to p. 111 Charitable works Wilbraham Almshouses, Monken Hadley In 1613, Sir Roger founded Wilbraham's Almshouses for six poor men at what was then the end of Welsh Row in Nantwich; they were the town's earliest almshouses.Hall, pp. 355, 358, 372 He also founded almshouses for two poor men in Acton in the same year.Lamberton & Gray, pp. 11‚Äì12 Additionally, he gave ¬£4 to be distributed among the poor of Nantwich on Good Friday every year. He was also active in Monken Hadley, founding almshouses for \\"six decayed housekeepers\\" in 1616. References and sources References Sources *de Figueiredo P, Treuherz J.

In a nine-season career, he played for the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Phillies. Hansen was officially listed as standing and weighing . He was nicknamed Swede despite being of Danish ancestry, according to The Sporting News' Baseball Register.Spink, J. G. Taylor, and Rickert, Paul, The 1949 Official Baseball Register. St. Louis: The Sporting News, 1949, p. 187 A two-sport star in high school, Hansen rose quickly through the Giants' minor league system and made his major league debut at age 19. He played for the Giants until 1946, when he voluntarily retired due to a family illness and then served in the United States Army. He returned to baseball in 1947 and earned a career-best five wins in 1948. After a contract holdout in 1949, Hansen's bullpen workload increased in 1950, leading to an elbow injury and the Giants sending him to the Phillies in the Rule 5 draft. Hansen worked nearly exclusively from the bullpen after being an occasional starting pitcher with New York. After tying his career high with five victories in 1952, Hansen went winless in 1953 and had a short tenure with the minor-league Hollywood Stars before retiring and beginning a 31-year career with the United States Postal Service. Early life Hansen was born November 12, 1924, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a young player, he was a second baseman and third baseman before moving to pitcher.Singletary, p. 83 He attended Lake Worth High School, where he played offensive end on the football team and pitched for the baseball team. In 1942, Hansen was a member of Lake Worth's \\"Trojans\\" football team that went undefeated, and the school's baseball team went to the state tournament in the 1943 season with Hansen as a member of the pitching staff. After graduating that year, Hansen spurned football scholarship offers from \\"a number of schools, including Georgia Tech\\" to sign an amateur free agent contract worth $75 ($ today) per month with the National League's New York Giants. Early career =Minor leagues= The Giants assigned Hansen to their Appalachian League affiliate, the Bristol Twins, where, at age 18, he posted a \\"sensational [win‚Äìloss] record\\" of 12‚Äì3 in 16 games started. He allowed 39 runs in 115 innings pitched while walking 15 batters. Hansen began the 1944 season pitching for the Jersey City Giants, New York's top-level farm team. Managed by Hall of Fame catcher Gabby Hartnett, Hansen posted an 8‚Äì4 record, compiling a 1.89 earned run average (ERA) in 11 starts and 4 relief appearances. He allowed 90 hits and 28 walks in 100 innings pitched (1.18 WHIP). =1944: Major league debut= In 1944, Hansen opposed alt=A baseball- card image of a smiling man in a white baseball jersey and a blue baseball cap; above his head, it reads \\"Fred Ostermueller\\", the player's given name Hansen was called up to the major league club to make his debut on June 30, 1944, in place of Cliff Melton.Singletary, p. 84. He started the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates, pitching innings, striking out two and allowing six earned runs. However, the Giants scored five runs in the sixth inning against Pirates starter Fritz Ostermueller, so Hansen did not receive a decision; the Giants lost the contest, 9‚Äì8. His first career loss came the next week on July 5, a 4‚Äì1 defeat against the St. Louis Cardinals. Hansen pitched six innings and allowed four runs, but Cardinals starter Red Munger, 10‚Äì2 on the season to that point, pitched a complete game and allowed only one run. He lost again on July 9, this time to the Chicago Cubs in the first game of a doubleheader. Hansen pitched only innings, allowing five runs, before being relieved by Rube Fischer. Hansen earned his first win a week later, an 8‚Äì3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on July 16. The victory came in relief of Frank Seward, who started the game but pitched only one inning. He pitched four innings, allowing only one run; Ace Adams followed with four scoreless innings and earned the save. His fourth decision, a second career victory, did not come until July 31, when he defeated future teammate Jim Konstanty in a 9‚Äì7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Hansen appeared again in a relief role, but pitched eight innings of one-run ball after starter Bill Voiselle allowed six runs in the game's first inning. At the plate, Hansen got his first major-league hit and scored his second career run while striking out once. Philadelphia provided Hansen with his third career win as well; it came on August 4 when he pitched against Ken Raffensberger. Hansen entered in the eighth inning and pitched three scoreless frames in relief of Voiselle as the game went to extra innings. The Giants won, 4‚Äì3, on a 10th-inning run with no one out. Sporting a 3‚Äì2 record, Hansen earned his first career save against the Phillies on August 6, pitching two scoreless innings in relief of Harry Feldman and striking out two. It was his only save of the season. He lost his third decision of the year on August 19, allowing five runs and walking six batters in the Giants' 12th consecutive loss out of a season-long 13-game streak. For his rookie season, Hansen finished with a 3‚Äì3 record and a 6.49 ERA in innings pitched; he appeared in 23 games (4 starts) and struck out 15 batters while walking 32 at age 19. =1945‚Äì1946: New York, Jersey City, and the Army= In the 1945 season, Hansen spent most of his playing time with the major league Giants, appearing in 23 games for them that year. Described by Baseball-Reference.com as New York's fifth starter, he was the Giants' youngest pitcher, and second-youngest player (Whitey Lockman), in 1945. Hansen started New York's third game of the season, pitching against the Boston Braves; he struck out three and allowed one run through seven innings, earning the victory. He defeated Raffensberger and the Phillies again on April 24, pitching his first career complete game in a 5‚Äì2 Giants win. After that game, manager Mel Ott said that he was encouraged by the performance because pitching was a concern of the Giants entering the season. Hansen's first loss of the season came against the Brooklyn Dodgers, a 4‚Äì3 defeat. After dueling to a stalemate in a tie game with Boston‚Äîhe and Braves starter Al Javery each allowed one run through seven innings in the second half of a rain-shortened doubleheader‚ÄîHansen earned his third victory on May 13 against the Cardinals; it was the last game of New York's season-long eight-game winning streak. Hansen earned a no decision in a May 17 start against the Cubs, but a 5‚Äì2 loss to the Pirates on May 21 dropped his record to 3‚Äì2; he allowed four earned runs in four innings. His first save of the season came on May 24, when he pitched two innings following Adams, the regular closer, who earned the win; his final decision in May was a victory over Cincinnati, a 5‚Äì1 win which was the last in a four-game win streak. He started the first game of a doubleheader on May 30, pitching innings and allowing six runs; the Giants managed an 8‚Äì6 win, however, as Slim Emmerich relieved him and pitched scoreless innings. In early June, Hansen pitched in both games of a doubleheader against the Cardinals; he started the first game (allowing two runs in of an inning) and relieved Feldman in the second (pitching innings and giving up three runs). He earned his second save of the season pitching perfect innings against Brooklyn in relief of Van Mungo on June 7, but followed that with his third loss against Boston, where he allowed three runs in six innings. The third loss was Hansen's final major league decision of the season. He pitched in four more games in June, starting on June 15 and allowing four earned runs in five innings, and pitching in relief on June 17, 22, and 24. He picked up a save in his final June game, pitching the final third of an inning in relief of Voiselle and Feldman in a 7‚Äì6 victory over Philadelphia. On June 26, Hansen reported to Camp Blanding in his home state of Florida for a pre-induction examination for the United States Army; his service commitment had previously been deferred due to a breathing handicap from an earlier broken nose. In July, Hansen appeared for the first time on Independence Day, pitching of an inning in relief of Emmerich and allowing three runs. His final start of 1945 came against the Reds on July 7; he allowed four runs through innings as the Giants won, 11‚Äì7. Hansen allowed two runs in four innings facing the Cubs on July 15, and gave up three runs in against the Pirates on July 20. His final outing of the season was also his shortest; he allowed a run to Boston without putting out a single batter in the second game of a doubleheader. At the beginning of August, Hansen injured his shoulder and was optioned to Jersey City in favor of Sal Maglie, where he appeared in five games (1‚Äì3, 7.31 ERA). After serving seven months in the military, Hansen asked the team to voluntarily retire him in early 1946 due to his father's severe illness.Singletary, p. 87. He did not appear in a game at any level during the 1946 season, but stated that he did not plan to give up baseball as a career. After the military =1947: One win for New York= Hansen returned to the Giants in April 1947, pitching a scoreless ninth inning in his first appearance against the Phillies. In his second game back, he allowed four runs to the Braves, working three innings in relief of Monty Kennedy; the Giants lost the game, 14‚Äì5. Hansen did not appear for the Giants in May, but returned to action on June 1 for his first start of the season. After allowing four runs in of an inning, Hansen was relieved by Junior Thompson, who earned the victory as the Giants defeated the Reds, 13‚Äì9; the outing raised Hansen's ERA to a season-high 16.62. He did not appear again for New York until June 21, when he pitched of an inning against the Cardinals, allowing no runs. As the summer months continued, Hansen was used more heavily; he made six appearances in July, all in Giants losses. On July 2, he pitched the final inning of an 11‚Äì3 loss to Brooklyn, allowing no hits. Hansen allowed runs in each of his next two outings, both against St. Louis: he pitched two innings on July 10, and threw five innings on July 12 in the second game of a doubleheader. In a 10‚Äì5 loss to the Cardinals on July 22, Hansen made his third consecutive appearance against the Redbirds, allowing no earned runs in innings. On July 28, he turned in a hitless, scoreless performance against Cincinnati, working one inning in a 5‚Äì0 shutout, and received his first decision‚Äîa loss‚Äîagainst the Reds on the final day of that month in an 8‚Äì7 contest. alt=A baseball card image of a man in a white pinstriped baseball uniform holding a light-colored baseball bat in both hands; above his head, it reads \\"Fred Walker\\", the player's given name In August, Hansen appeared in nine games, his most in a single month during the 1947 season; he began on August 3 by allowing two runs to the Pirates in of an inning. He made his second start of the season against the Braves on August 10; although he pitched innings and allowed just three runs, he did not factor in the decision. Closer Ken Trinkle, who relieved Hansen, took the loss after a three-run home run by Tommy Holmes in the ninth inning as the Giants lost, 7‚Äì5. After a one-inning appearance against the Phillies on August 13, Hansen made his third start of the year on August 17 and notched his second loss of the season, this time to Boston. He allowed one run through seven innings, but the Braves defeated New York, 3‚Äì1. The defeat was Hansen's first of four consecutive appearances in the second games of doubleheaders, the third of which was another start and his third loss of the year. He allowed the game's only runs in a inning performance; the Giants lost, 4‚Äì0. After two more multi- inning relief appearances against Chicago on August 24 and 25, Hansen pitched seven innings in a start against Brooklyn in what would be his last appearance in the month. He allowed one run in seven innings, walking six batters. In the seventh inning, his middle finger was bruised by a line drive hit up the middle by Dixie Walker. Hansen walked Arky Vaughan, the first batter in the eighth inning, before leaving the game, and Cookie Lavagetto singled with the bases loaded to drive in the winning runs for the Dodgers; the Giants fell, 3‚Äì1. Hansen returned to the mound on September 4, starting his sixth game of the season. Although he pitched eight innings and allowed two runs, Hansen earned his fourth loss of the season, as the Giants lost to Brooklyn, 2‚Äì0. His next outing, which came in relief against the Dodgers, was scoreless, but he allowed four runs in three innings to the Pirates the following day. After two more scoreless relief appearances, Hansen started against the Phillies on September 20. He pitched a complete game, allowing three runs (two earned) on four hits; the 5‚Äì3 victory was his only win of the 1947 season, defeating Philadelphia starter Ken Heintzelman. Hansen appeared twice more in the 1947 season: he pitched innings in a start against the Dodgers on September 24, allowing four runs; and he lost his final start of the season against the Phillies four days later, pitching four innings and allowing three runs. For the season, Hansen posted a 1‚Äì5 record, a 4.37 ERA, and 18 strikeouts in 27 games as a 22-year-old, the Giants' second-youngest pitcher (Mario Picone). =1948: One hundred innings, five victories= alt=An unsmiling, dark-haired man with large ears; above his head, it reads \\"Melvin Ott\\" Hansen opened his 1948 campaign with five consecutive scoreless appearances. His first game was on April 22, when he pitched of an inning against the Dodgers, walking one batter and allowing a single hit. His second game was also against Brooklyn; he allowed two hits and a walk in of an inning in his final April appearance. After a 21-day layoff, Hansen returned to play on May 21, pitching a scoreless inning against the Chicago Cubs. Two more scoreless innings prompted Ott to start Hansen against the Dodgers in the second game of a May 31 doubleheader, and Hansen pitched a complete game to earn his first win of the season, allowing only one unearned run in the 10‚Äì1 victory. Hansen's June appearances consisted of three starts and five relief outings. In two of his three starts, he lasted two innings or less, allowing three runs in two frames to Cincinnati on June 4, and four runs in of an inning against St. Louis 14 days later. The latter game was his second loss of the season‚Äîthe first having been earned on July 11 in his other start of the month, wherein he pitched six innings, allowed three runs, and walked five batters. Hansen's appearances from the bullpen were more successful; in innings, he allowed three runs, all in a single outing on June 24 against the Cubs. His longest appearance of the month was a seven-inning relief outing against the Cardinals on June 13; starter Dave Koslo took the loss in the game for allowing three runs in the game's first inning, and Hansen completed the remainder of the game without allowing a run. In July, Hansen began with a start on July 2, and ended with a win on July 31. His only start in July came against Brooklyn, when he pitched innings and allowed four runs. He made two appearances in high-scoring games during the month without recording any outs: he faced two batters against Brooklyn on July 4, walking one and allowing a hit; and repeated the outing on July 10, this time allowing two hits and giving up two runs. Between those two outings, he appeared in both games of a July 5 doubleheader against the Braves, pitching two perfect innings in each game. His July victory came against the Cubs, when he struck out two batters and walked none in scoreless innings on the month's final day. In August, Hansen did not earn any decisions, but he did notch his only save of the season in his second August contest. He pitched scoreless innings against Boston to secure a 6‚Äì5 win for Koslo. Three days later, he allowed two earned runs in a three-inning appearance against Philadelphia; they would be the only earned runs he allowed in the entire month of August, lowering his ERA from 3.40 to 3.10. He finished the month with four consecutive scoreless appearances, striking out two batters and walking one between August 15 and August 31. On September 3, Hansen was pressed into service as a starter for the first time in two months of play, and he delivered a quality start for New York, allowing three runs in eight innings pitched‚Äîhis third victory and first complete game of the season. He was rewarded with another start on September 7, and pitched his second consecutive complete game to earn a fourth win, this time scattering ten hits in nine innings against the Phillies, striking out three batters and allowing only a home run to Bert Haas. Starting again on September 11, Hansen allowed two runs in innings before being relieved by Koslo; neither pitcher earned the win in the shortened game, as Trinkle pitched the sixth and final inning of the doubleheader's second game to notch the victory. Hansen earned his fifth win out of the bullpen when the Giants came from behind to defeat Cincinnati, 12‚Äì7, on September 18, and completed his season record with a loss in a start against Chicago on September 22; he allowed six runs (five earned) on nine hits while walking three hitters and striking out two. For the season, Hansen accumulated a 5‚Äì3 record, a 2.97 ERA (his best career season to date), and 27 strikeouts, having faced a career-high 419 batters in 100 innings pitched. =1949: Four consecutive mid-season losses= After his career-best five wins in the prior season, Hansen held out for a better contract in February 1949, along with another Giants pitcher, Clint Hartung; and Walker Cooper, the Giants' captain. He signed on February 6, and opened the 1949 season pitching in New York's second contest, allowing 1 run while pitching innings of a 6‚Äì2 loss to Brooklyn. Hansen took his first loss of the season in his next contest; after the Phillies and Giants played to a tie in nine innings, New York scored two runs in the top of the 11th, but Hansen, who entered to relieve, allowed three to score while recording only two outs, handing the Giants a 12‚Äì11 extra-inning defeat. In the next game against the Dodgers, however, he recorded his first victory of the year behind a pinch-hit inside- the-park grand slam from Pete Milne, pitching a scoreless seventh inning and striking out two. Hansen had one other appearance in April, allowing a single run in three innings against Brooklyn the following day in a 15‚Äì2 loss. In the next month, he also made four appearances, the first of which came on May 24; he pitched two scoreless innings against the Cubs. After allowing his only run of the month to the Phillies on May 27, Hansen pitched in both games of a doubleheader on May 30, throwing of an inning in the first contest and earning his only save of the season in the second by striking out two batters in scoreless innings. On June 1, Hansen started his first game of the season, pitching innings and allowing four runs; he was replaced by Red Webb, who pitched the remaining and won the game, 11‚Äì5. Hansen earned his second defeat of the season on June 12, when he allowed a single game-winning run to the Pirates in innings of work; he walked three batters and struck out five in the contest. He appeared in back-to-back games on June 17 and 18: a 6‚Äì4 loss to Pittsburgh the first day, and a 5‚Äì4 win for New York on the second. This game would be his last appearance in a Giants win until the season's final month. His next two outings‚Äîagainst the Cardinals on June 22 and the Cubs on June 24‚Äîwere perfect; he allowed no baserunners until June 25, when he gave up a single hit to Chicago in a 4‚Äì1 defeat. His final appearance of June came in the first game of a June 30 with the Boston Braves, in which he pitched two innings and allowed one hit. In July, Hansen struggled mightily, appearing in four games; each contest was a loss for the Giants, and each decision was tallied against him. On July 2, he allowed 5 runs in innings against Brooklyn, walking one batter and allowing two home runs. His five runs allowed accounted for the Dodgers' margin of victory in the 13‚Äì8 Giants defeat. He pitched four innings in relief of Sheldon Jones on July 10, suffering the loss when he walked three batters and allowed three runs to score. Hansen's one run allowed on July 16 proved once again to be his undoing as the Pirates defeated the Giants, 7‚Äì6, and dropped his record to 1‚Äì5; nevertheless, he earned the start against Pittsburgh on July 26 and took his sixth loss, allowing 4 runs on 4 walks in innings to finish July at 1‚Äì6 on the season. In August, all of Hansen's appearances came in Giants losses, the first of which was on August 7‚Äîhe pitched the two final innings against the Cardinals, allowing one hit but no runs. After a scoreless inning on August 12, Hansen appeared in back-to- back games against Boston on August 17 and 18, walking one and striking out one in the former game and allowing two runs in of an inning in the latter. He allowed a run to Philadelphia on August 19, then pitched in consecutive games on August 27 and 28, the second and first games of doubleheaders, respectively. The Giants lost to St. Louis, 11‚Äì2, on August 27; Hansen allowed one unearned run in that game. The next day, he pitched two perfect innings against the Cincinnati Reds, striking out one, but New York was defeated, 10‚Äì3. In his first September game, Hansen earned his final decision of the season when he defeated Pittsburgh, 9‚Äì5, pitching one scoreless inning in relief of Hank Behrman. He pitched the next game as well‚Äîthe following day against Brooklyn‚Äîbut the Giants were shut out, 8‚Äì0. He made a scoreless appearance against Philadelphia on September 6, and allowed 4 runs in innings on September 8, raising his ERA from 4.18 to 4.64. Hansen made his final appearance on September 11 with a perfect of an inning, striking out the only batter he faced; his final game of the season was logged on September 18, but he faced no batters and did not physically appear in the game. His final record for the year was two wins against six losses; he amassed 26 strikeouts and 28 bases on balls, allowing an average of 4.61 runs per nine innings. =1950: Midseason injury= In April 1950, Hansen appeared in two games. His first appearance of the season came against the rival Dodgers; he pitched two scoreless innings, giving up three hits and walking two batters. A week later, he pitched the fourth inning of another contest against Brooklyn, this time allowing no baserunners. His first game the next month came against the Pirates on May 6, where he earned his first save of the season in a 9‚Äì8 victory. All of his other appearances in May, however, came in New York losses. On May 14, Hansen started the second game of a doubleheader against Philadelphia, pitching innings and allowing five runs on eight hits and two walks. The following week, he appeared in both games of a twinbill against the Pirates, pitching a combination perfect inning between the two contests: in the first and in the second. Beginning on May 25, Hansen pitched in four consecutive games to close out his month, allowing 1 run in innings in the first contest and throwing a scoreless frame in the second. On May 27, he struck out one batter and allowed a single hit in innings, and earned his first loss of the year in an extra-inning defeat by the Phillies the following day; he entered the game in the seventh inning and allowed 3 runs over frames to total a 5‚Äì2 final score. alt=A baseball-card image of a man in a white baseball jersey with \\"NEW YORK\\" (obscured) on the chest and a blue baseball cap with an interlocking orange \\"NY\\" on the front In June, Hansen began a heavy workload from the Giants' bullpen; the converted starter, who had never appeared in more than nine games in a single month in his major league career, was pressed into service 11 times in the third month of the season. On the month's first day, Hansen pitched in both games of a doubleheader against Cincinnati, throwing a perfect of an inning in the first half, and three scoreless in the second contest. The following day, he blew a save against the Reds in the sixth inning, allowing two hits and recording no outs. Against the Pirates on June 5, he recorded his second save of the season in a 5‚Äì4, ten- inning win, and followed it with another on June 8 in Chicago. On June 10, Hansen allowed 2 runs in innings against the Cardinals, and the next week gave up four runs to the Cubs by facing 12 batters. Two scoreless outings on June 19 and 21 were followed by an appearance in Game 1 of a June 25 doubleheader; he gave up one run on three hits and one walk. His final June appearance came against the Braves, a scoreless inning in which he walked two batters. The workload continued into July, when Hansen appeared in the first game of a July 2 doubleheader. He entered in the first inning in relief of starter Koslo, who allowed two runs without recording an out; none of the Giants' pitchers in the 11‚Äì5 defeat escaped unscathed, as all allowed at least two runs, topped by Hansen's five. His next two appearances came on July 4, as he pitched both games of a doubleheader against the Dodgers; he tossed two innings in each contest, striking out two in the first game and walking one in the nightcap. On July 5, he gave up five runs in the seventh inning against Philadelphia, recording two outs and allowing five hits. In his next two outings against Boston and Pittsburgh, he allowed no runs, but the game against the Pirates would be his last scoreless outing with New York. Pitching against the Reds on July 16, Hansen allowed 3 runs in innings; this was followed by four runs given up against the Cardinals on July 19. His final contest of the season came on July 25, when he pitched four innings against Cincinnati, allowing two runs before injuring his pitching elbow. Speaking with manager Leo Durocher, he claimed to feel a painless pop in his elbow as he threw a pitch; two hours later, the elbow had swollen \\"as big as a football\\" and visibly bruised, ending his season.Singletary, p. 90. Hansen ended the season with an 0‚Äì1 record, a 5.53 ERA, and 19 strikeouts; thereafter, he was selected by the Phillies in the Rule 5 draft. Philadelphia alt=A black-and-white photograph of a man wearing glasses, a dark baseball cap with a white \\"P\\" on the front, and a white baseball jersey with \\"Phillies\\" across the chest =1951: Return to the majors= After acquiring Hansen, the Phillies assigned him to the Triple-A Baltimore Orioles. He was called up to the major league club in July after posting a 1‚Äì1 record with a 5.45 ERA and 14 strikeouts, working exclusively from Baltimore's bullpen. Hansen's first appearance with Philadelphia came on July 6; he pitched two innings in relief of Russ Meyer, who allowed three runs without recording an out. Three straight appearances in doubleheader openers followed Hansen's Phillies debut: he faced two Cardinals batters without a putout on July 15; pitched two scoreless innings against Cincinnati two days later; and could have earned his first victory of the season on July 22 had Konstanty‚Äîthe closer and 1950's National League Most Valuable Player‚Äînot collected his fifth blown save of the year. Hansen pitched in three more games that month, recording his first decision of the season on July's final day: he defeated the Reds, 7‚Äì5, pitching one inning and allowing two runs. Hansen appeared in five games for the Phillies in August. All were multi-inning appearances as a relief pitcher, and only one was not scoreless‚Äîhe allowed four runs to the Braves in innings on August 15. He opened September with a victory, however‚Äîa 5‚Äì3 win over Boston‚Äîto raise his record to 2‚Äì0; it was his first of eleven appearances in the season's final month. Including the September 2 victory, Hansen finished three of his first four games for Philadelphia in the month, allowing no runs in any of those four appearances. The Pirates notched Hansen's first September runs allowed on the month's 12th day; although none of the runs were earned, Hansen still collected his only defeat of the 1951 season. In his next appearance, Hansen struck out a season-high four Cardinals in innings pitched on September 16; it was his only appearance in 1951 wherein he struck out multiple batters. Following a scoreless two-inning appearance against the Cubs on September 18, Hansen pitched the eighth inning against the Dodgers on September 23, allowing his first earned runs in over a month. After relieving starter Ken Johnson in the first inning of September 26's contest‚Äîpitching two innings and allowing one run‚ÄîHansen earned his final decision of the season on September 28, pitching three scoreless frames against Brooklyn to earn his third win. His 1951 season ended with a single scoreless inning the following day, also against the Dodgers; this lowered his season ERA to 2.54, the best mark among Phillies pitchers that year, and a career low for Hansen. On the season, he struck out 11 batters while walking 7, allowing 34 hits in 39 innings of work. =1952: Four-save July= Hansen's 1952 season did not open auspiciously; he appeared in the Phillies' second game of the season, entering in the ninth inning and allowing a sacrifice fly to the Giants' Alvin Dark with the bases loaded. Although it was no blemish on Hansen's ERA‚Äîthe runner having been allowed by starter Howie Fox‚Äîhe still earned a blown save in his first appearance of the year. His second appearance two days later was worse: Hansen entered the game in the eighth inning with a 7‚Äì6 lead, but allowed two runs in the top of the ninth, and a third earned was added to his tally after closer Konstanty, who relieved Hansen, allowed a sacrifice fly immediately thereafter. The Braves, Philadelphia's opponents in that contest, won the game, 9‚Äì7, and Hansen was saddled with his second blown save in as many appearances and his first loss of the season. His next three appearances were scoreless, but on May 16, he entered in the eighth inning of a game against the Reds with the Phillies leading, 2‚Äì1, and runners on first and second bases. He allowed a single to Bobby Adams, scoring Roy McMillan and blowing his third save, but the Phillies would win, 3‚Äì2, after Heintzelman pitched scoreless innings and the Phillies used small ball tactics (a walk to Eddie Waitkus, Heintzelman reaching on a fielder's choice, and a bunt single by Richie Ashburn) to load the bases in the bottom of the tenth inning, winning on a single by Granny Hamner. After two scoreless appearances against St. Louis and New York, Hansen allowed one run in a three-inning appearance against his former club on May 24. Hansen pitched in both extra-inning games of a doubleheader on May 27, pitching the twelfth and final inning against Boston in a 4‚Äì2 loss in the first contest, and earning his first victory in the tenth inning of the second after Del Ennis' triple and Willie Jones' sacrifice fly scored the winning run in the bottom half of the frame. Three more relief appearances closed out the month, two of them scoreless; his only run allowed was against the Pirates on the final day of May. Willie Jones June 29 throwing error cost Hansen three unearned runs.alt=A baseball card image of a smiling man wearing a gray baseball jersey with \\"Phillies\\" in red across the chest and a red baseball cap with a white \\"P\\" on the front Hansen's June was also inauspicious, as all six of his appearances came in Phillies losses. He had two scoreless one-inning stints against the Reds and the Cubs on June 5 and 10, respectively, before a three-inning appearance against the Pirates in the first game of a June 15 doubleheader. In the contest, he struck out one and walked one in a scoreless outing to lower his ERA to 2.75, and followed with a scoreless inning on June 19 to push it down to 2.61, his lowest to that point of the season. He allowed his only earned runs of the month on June 22, when Hansen walked the bases loaded in the top of the ninth inning against Cincinnati; Konstanty entered, allowing a double to former teammate Andy Seminick that scored two. In his final June game, he allowed three runs, but none were earned due to a throwing error by third baseman Willie \\"Puddin' Head\\" Jones. At the end of June and beginning of July, closer Konstanty blew two saves, one of which resulted in a 4‚Äì3 loss to Brooklyn, so Hansen assumed some of the closing duties for the season's fourth month. He collected his first save of the season on the second of July, pitching two scoreless innings against the Dodgers in relief of Russ Meyer. After allowing two runs to the Cardinals on July 10, Hansen bounced back with consecutive saves‚Äîon July 13 against Chicago; and again on July 16 versus the Pirates, in which Hansen relieved Roberts after the latter allowed a two-run ninth-inning home run. On July 22, he earned his fourth save of the month in a two-inning performance against Pittsburgh, and closed the month with two consecutive victories, defeating the Cubs on July 27, and the Reds two days after. In August, Hansen pitched innings in the team's first contest, allowing two runs to the Cardinals on four hits and losing his third game of the season. He appeared in three consecutive doubleheaders (August 9, 11, and 13) and followed by pitching of an inning in a 15‚Äì0 loss at Brooklyn on August 16. Hansen rested until August 22, when he relieved Curt Simmons against the Cincinnati Reds; he pitched innings, allowing two runs on three hits, walking two, and absorbing a fourth loss. Beginning on August 24, he finished three games against the Cubs on consecutive game-days: pitching a perfect inning on August 24; earning a win with two scoreless innings on August 25; and taking the loss on August 26 in the 13th inning of the series' final contest. He bounced back to close the month with a fifth win, though, defeating Boston, 8‚Äì6, behind a -inning relief performance. In his first September game, Hansen took the loss by allowing a single run to the Giants on the month's third day; he finished the month by pitching in two consecutive losses, with his final appearance coming on September 12. For the season, he finished with a 5‚Äì6 record, a 3.26 ERA, and 18 strikeouts in a team-leading 43 games pitched‚Äîa year in which his performance was described as \\"excellent relieving\\". =1953: Last major league year= alt=A black-and-white photograph of a man wearing a white baseball jersey with \\"Phillies\\" (obscured) across the chest, a dark-colored baseball cap with a white \\"P\\" on the front, and a baseball mitt on his left hand Hansen's first game of the 1953 season resulted in his first loss; in a 14‚Äì12 contest against the Pirates, he allowed four runs‚Äîone earned‚Äîin the fifth frame, the only inning he pitched. His next appearance resulted in his first save of the year, coming against Pittsburgh on April 25, and he pitched in his final April game three days later against St. Louis. Hansen's first appearance in May came against the newly relocated Milwaukee Braves, late of Boston, when he allowed a walk and two hits, one a home run, in a single inning. He threw a scoreless frame against Brooklyn on May 10, and a perfect on May 12 to earn his second save. He allowed two runs against Milwaukee on May 18, but both were unearned, lowering his ERA to a season-low 2.25; three runs in his next appearance, however, raised his average to its highest point since the year's first game. His last game in May was against Pittsburgh: of an inning with one unearned run allowed. Hansen opened June with a doubleheader, pitching in both games and allowing no runs; he gave up a hit in the first game and walked a batter in the second, striking out one batter in each contest. He pitched the ninth inning in both games, earning his third save of the year in the nightcap. He gave up two runs to the Braves in his next appearance, allowing a home run and an RBI single in three innings. On June 9, he again allowed two runs, this time to the Cubs; the two home runs given up resulted in his first blown save of the season. After a perfect inning against Cincinnati on June 12, he made his first scoreless appearance against Milwaukee in the season; he allowed two hits in of an inning but neither runner scored. On June 17, he faced the Braves again, this time pitching three scoreless innings and allowing two singles and a double. Waiting ten days until his next appearance, Hansen took the mound for two scoreless innings against St. Louis, and earned a hold on June 30 against Brooklyn after Konstanty blew a save. In his first July game, he pitched innings, allowing two runs on three hits and walking three batters. Two days later, he pitched five scoreless innings within both halves of a doubleheader against his former team, the Giants; he walked one batter in each game and struck out three hitters in the second. After an 11-day hiatus, he returned to the hill in an 11‚Äì0 loss to the Reds, allowing an unearned run on three hits in relief of Konstanty. One-and-two-thirds scoreless innings against the Cubs on July 21 was his final scoreless outing of the month, followed by a single run allowed to the Braves on July 27 and two runs given up to the Reds three days later. On August 3, Hansen entered in the second inning of a contest against the Reds after Konstanty and Thornton Kipper allowed 7 runs in innings against the Reds; he pitched frames and allowed 1 run. On August 17, he made his first start in three years, absorbing the loss as the Phillies were shut out, 6‚Äì0. His final two August games came on back-to-back days: the second half of a doubleheader on August 30 (1 walk and 1 strikeout in scoreless innings); and the first half of a twinbill on August 31 (one run allowed on one walk and two hits in a single inning). He made one September appearance, allowing two runs without recording an out; for the year, he finished with an 0‚Äì2 record and three saves with a 4.03 ERA. After the conclusion of the season, Hansen was traded with Jack Lohrke and $70,000 ($ today) to Pittsburgh in exchange for Murry Dickson. In 270 games, Hansen posted only a .102 batting average (12-for-118) with only 3 RBI. He was excellent defensively, recording a .989 fielding percentage with only two errors in 179 total chances. He handled his first 162 chances in the majors successfully until he committed his first error in his final appearance in the 1952 season. After the majors In 1954, Hansen was assigned to the Pirates- affiliated Hollywood Stars, an Open-classification minor league team based in Los Angeles. He appeared in three games, accumulating a 1.35 ERA on the mound and one hit in three at-bats at the plate. In one of those contests, he and Red Munger combined to hold the rival Los Angeles Angels to a 1‚Äì0 shutout. After being voted outstanding player of the week for his short tenure, Hansen voluntarily retired himself a second time after Pittsburgh Pirates president Branch Rickey refused to pay him $750 ($ today) that he was owed.Singletary, p. 93. The Pirates sent him a contract to play for the Triple-A New Orleans Pelicans, along with a paycheck, but he did not report, opting to remain retired. Hansen was first married to Bertha Mae ( Perkins), also a native of Lake Worth, Florida. They had two children, one a daughter named Gale Andra, before his wife contracted cancer and died. He had dated his second wife, Joy, when he was playing for the Giants in his early career, and they were described as \\"recently wedded\\" when interviewed by author Wes Singletary for his 2006 book.Singletary, p. 12. Hansen worked seasonally for the United States Postal Service during his baseball career, and became a permanent employee for 31 years until retiring. In 1988, he was inducted into the Palm Beach County Sports Commission's Hall of Fame. He died on February 2, 2002, in his hometown.

The Istimrari chieftains paid tribute to their masters but were not compelled to participate in wars unless called upon by their respective chiefs. In the Indian feudal system of 17th and 18th century, there were 66 Istimararis in the Rajputana (North west India). The Istimrari estates were originally only Jagirs, held under obligation of military service. The Marathas, however, who found it impolitic to encourage the warlike tendencies of their Rajput vassals, commuted this obligation for a fixed tribute.Imperial gazetteer of India: provincial series, Volume 23, page 474  Istimrari  The istimrari chieftains,Reginald M.A. Branson, Digest of all the Cases relating to India, page 1317 accordingly, acquired the habit of regarding themselves as holders at a fixed and permanent quit-rent; and although during the earlier period of British rule extra cesses were levied from time to time, in 1841 the Government remitted all such collections for the future.

The books chronicle the lives of the Juvikings, an old Norwegian landowning peasant family living in the Namdal valley. The series covers six or seven generations of Juvikings, starting with Per Anders Juvika, the last of the old style Juvikings, and ending with Per and Anders, the sons of Odin Setran, Per Anders' great-great-great grandfather. The first novel, The Trough of the Wave (Juvikingar in Norwegian), starts out at Juvik, a fictional farm in the Namdal, but moves to Haaberg when Per Anders' son Per leaves his ancestral lands and buys his sister's late husband's farm. The first three books follow the Juvikings from the 18th century to the late 19th; the final three follow the childhood, life and eventually death of Odin. The six novels were originally published in Norway between 1918 and 1923. They were later translated by Arthur G. Chater into English, and published by Alfred Knopf in America between 1930 and 1935. Style Duun was known as one of the outstanding writers of 20th-century Norwegian fiction. He stands as a remarkable synthesis of the Norwegian folk spirit and the European cultural form. Duun wrote in Landsm√•l, an amalgam of peasant dialects that developed into Nynorsk, one of the official languages of Norway. Many of his books incorporate the dialects of his subjects: peasants, fishermen and farmers. His novels analyze the psychological and spiritual characteristics of rural, peasant life.Olav Duun -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia at www.britannica.com The dialogue of Duun's characters is often very light and earthy, and often a single paragraph will contain the speech of multiple characters, separated by a dash. In contrast, Duun's descriptions of nature and of landscapes are lyrical and beautiful, often including personifications of places or natural forces. Influence Olav Duun is thought to be one of the most important writers of the 20th century. Among those influenced by his work was Nobel Prize winning author Sigrid Undset, who considered Duun to be Norway's greatest writer.Olav Duun -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia at www.britannica.com However, his unique usage of landsm√•l has perhaps limited his influence outside of Norway. The Series =The Trough of the Wave= The Trough of the Wave (Juvikingar), originally published in Norway in 1918, was translated and published in America in 1930. The story opens in the first years of the nineteenth century with Per Anders, the last of the old-timers, one who fears neither man nor devil and laughs at the superstitions of his womenfolk. He is disappointed in his sons; Jens, the elder, has all the ruthlessness of his race, but none of their steadying qualities. Per is steady enough, but weak and troubled with an uneasy conscience. He and his brother have chased a thief into the sea, and the thought of this ugly deed pursues Per as long as he lives. On the death of the old man the family breaks up. Per moves to the other side of the fjord, where he buys the farm of Haaberg from a widowed sister. As Jens prefers the roving life the old farm of Juvik goes to a younger sister, who has married beneath her. Henceforward the home of the Juvikings is Haaberg. Per dies before he has got the farm into shape, leaving two sons, Anders and Petter. =The Blind Man= The Blind Man (I blinda), published in Norway in 1919 and in America in 1931, deals with Anders. In each generation there is a capable man and a ne‚Äôer-do-well. Anders has many of the Juvikings‚Äô best qualities, together with a strong dose of obstinacy. Petter is a spiteful sneak, with just too little backbone to be a thoroughly bad man. He tries his elder brother sorely, and Anders is very patient with him. Anders is in love with Massi Liness, but when she marries his friend Ola Engdal, he takes as his wife, Solvi, a girl of Lapp blood and a former sweetheart of Petter. To marry a Lapp is a disgrace in itself, but worse than this is to come. Misfortunes fall on Engdal and on others in the parish, while Haaberg is suspiciously lucky. The neighbors put this down to Lapp sorcery, and Anders has sufficient belief in this to turn Solvi out of his house and pack her and their child off to her father‚Äôs cabin. Petter starts a rock-slide which falls on Solvi‚Äôs boat, drowning her and the child. Anders does not know how to take this: he wished the rocks to fall and has a certain sense of guilt. But he succeeds in putting it out of his mind; the farm prospers; after Engdal‚Äôs early death Anders marries Massi and they have a large family. In middle age Anders‚Äôs sight begins to fail; he tries a remedy of his own ‚Äî hot tar ‚Äî and becomes totally blind. Per, the hope of the family, dies young; Jens, the second son, shows the roving tendency of his namesake of two generations back and goes to America. The youngest, Ola, is something of a scholar and of little use in practical life; he becomes parish clerk. One daughter, Gjartru, marries an ex-sergeant named Arnesen and they keep a store at Segelsund, down on the fjord. The other daughter, Aasel, marries a man from the South, and it is left for her to carry on the family and the farm of Haaberg. =The Big Wedding= The date of The Big Wedding (Storbybryllope, published in Norway in 1920 and in America in 1931) is about 1880. Blind Anders is still alive, well over seventy. The Arnesens have a daughter, Mina, who is engaged to Arthur Ween, son of the local vet. Aasel‚Äôs son, Peder, is to take over Haaberg on finding a suitable wife. One of his cousins at Juvik is with child by him, but his mother does not think her good enough and gets the girl to relinquish her claim. Ola has been courting Andrea Ween, Arthur‚Äôs sister, in a half-hearted way; piqued by his backwardness she throws him over and accepts his nephew Peder. The double wedding, Mina‚Äôs and Peder‚Äôs, is celebrated at Haaberg. Uncle Jens arrives on a visit from America, where he has made money. In the middle of the festivities Petter plays a last prank on his blind brother and it results in the death of Anders. Arnesen, who has been speculating in herrings, learns that he is ruined. He and Gjartru go to America with Jens. Peder dies of consumption very soon after taking over Haaberg; he leaves a daughter, Astri. =Odin in Fairyland= Originally released in Norway as I eventyre (literally, \\"in a fairytale\\") in 1921, and in America in 1933, the fourth book begins the story of Odin Setran which occupies the remaining three books. Ola Haaberg, the parish clerk, had always been looking for ‚Äúhim who should come,‚Äù a scion of the race who should inherit the virtues of the old Juvikings and as it were justify the whole family. Odin is the one who fulfills this hope. He is the illegitimate son of Aasel‚Äôs daughter Elen, by one Otte Setran, a joiner by trade, who emigrates to America before the boy is born. In Odin in Fairyland we have the story of his childhood. When he is seven years old his mother marries a farmer named Iver Vennestad, and Odin is put out to serve as herd-boy on a small holding called Kjelvik. The people there, Bendek and Gurianna, are kind to him, and he has many adventures as he discovers the world around him. His father returns from America and asks if Odin would like to go and live with him, but the boy prefers to stay at Kjelvik. Now there are certain secrets in Bendek‚Äôs life which are best let alone, and when Odin stumbles upon one of these the old man flies into a rage and turns him out of the house on a stormy Christmas night. Odin reaches Vennestad more dead than alive, and his mother and stepfather keep him there. Till one day Gurianna comes over with the news that Bendek is ill and wishes to see Odin. The lad at once goes back to Kjelvik and stays there till Bendek dies. It is here that we first meet with Lauris, who is destined to play an all-important part in the books which follow. He is a lad four years older than Odin, and a relative of Bendek; a wily rascal who is not above petty thieving. Odin with his generous nature is no unfriendly to Lauris, though he feels from the first that some day he will have to come to grips with him. Otte Setran, who has been carrying on his trade in the neighborhood, is suspected of having set fire to his cottage for the insurance money, whereupon Odin, whose instinct always prompts him to take the loser‚Äôs part, volunteers to go and live with him. In the last scene of this book Odin is overtaken by a storm while rowing a girl called Ingri Arnesen across the fjord. The boat capsizes and they are rescued with difficulty. =Odin Grows Up= Published in Norway as I ungdommen (literally, \\"in youth\\") in 1922, Odin Grows Up was released in America in 1934. This penultimate book in the saga of the Juvikings finds Odin a little grown up, out of his \\"fairyland\\", but still in the midst of youth and innocence. He falls in love with his cousin, Astri, but their respective parents fall in love with each other and ruin their prospects as a couple. Odin at first wants to fight for their happiness, but Astri gives up on their chances and actually encourages the older couple to marry. In the face of this devastating turn of events, Odin leaves the farm at Haaberg and joins his old sometimes friend, sometimes enemy, Lauris, at sea. The two sail the Northern seas for a while, fishing for and selling herring, but business is little to Odin's taste. Odin becomes exposed to Lauris' womanizing, and feels even less inclined to it. After a long time, he returns to Haaberg, only to find his father and Astri's mother ready to marry. Odin, however does not fight for her now, even though Astri now hopes that he will. Faced with this mutual disappointment, the couple drift apart, each going their separate ways in life. Astri somehow becomes romantically involved with Lauris, and the two marry, despite his proven unfaithfulness in the past. Meanwhile, Aasel, the eldest living Juviking, wonders what to do with Haaberg since none of her grandchildren show promise of producing a satisfying heir. She decides to divine the farm into three portions, selling one to Odin, one to Astri and the other to a stranger who is actually working for Lauris. Astri and Lauris, as well as old Ola, are against dividing the farm, though Odin finally supports it as it is Aasel's wish. Aasel soon passes away, and at her funeral ale Odin decides to establish a poorhouse, which he believes to have been Aasel's will, and attempts to convince his friends and neighbors to help him in this endeavour, though he is opposed again by Ola Haaberg and Astri. Finally, Odin reunites with a girl he has met once before‚Äîat the end of Odin in Fairyland‚ÄîIngri Arnesen, who he recognizes as the girl of his childhood dreams. The book ends with Odin and Ingri together, having decided to face the world together. =The Storm= The Storm (I stormen), published in Norway in 1923 and in America in 1935, covers the later life, and eventually death, of Odin Setran. Odin and Ingri have been married for about twenty years now, and have had two sons, Anders and Per. Lauris and Astri, too, have two children: Arne and Peder. The two couples both live on Haaberg, which has been separated into thirds; Odin owns a third, and Lauris the other two-thirds, which he obtained through trickery. In the interval years between Odin Grows Up and this novel, Odin has started up a factory producing herring oil, which is owned in shares by several men in the parish. Facing things like labor strikes, dissatisfied shareholders, and the ambition of men like Lauris and Engelbert Olsen, Odin works to keep the factory on an even keel. At a meeting of the shareholders, Odin loses his place as the man in charge, replaced by Lauris. Lauris, however soon takes ill and Odin is forced to perform his old job anyway. Meanwhile, Bonsach Arnesen, Ingri's father, is given a management position at the factory, which he soon resigns due to fear that his past (he had served time in jail for a minor crime) would cause Ingri and Odin suffering. Meanwhile, Lauris and Engelbert work at a plot to discredit Odin in the eyes of the parish. Engelbert attempts to spread gossip about Ingri and her father, which ends in an encounter between him and Odin, in which Odin drives him into the sea. Engelbert washes up on shore the next day, where Lauris persuades him to flee the parish secretly, so that Lauris can charge Odin with murder. Meanwhile, a letter found by Mina of Segelsund upon the suicide of old Ola Haaberg reveals a minor crime of Lauris', which Mina eventually takes to the sheriff. Because of this, Astri is caught between her feelings of duty and love for Lauris, and her conscious which will not allow her to tell a lie. Astri ultimately decides to tell the truth, and because of this they are spared public embarrassment. In reaction to Lauris' rumors, Odin is determined to kill Lauris, and bides his time. Eventually Astri falls ill, and Odin asks Lauris to go across the fjord to get the doctor. Because of the violent storm, Lauris tries to get out of it, but Odin is insistent. The doctor declines due to the weather, and on the way back to Haaberg the boat is overturned. Odin and Lauris realize that the boat will now only hold one of them, and they fight for survival. Odin wins, and Lauris floats helplessly in the sea. But Odin changes his mind, telling himself that he will not be a murderer. He lets Lauris have the goat, and drifts away supported by the oars. Eventually Odin washes up on shore, having drowned in the storm. At the funeral ale, his friends and family draw two conclusions: firstly, that by giving up his life to save his enemy, Odin had won a victory over Lauris; and secondly, that Lauris had become a different person after the ordeal. The series ends when Anders, Odin's eldest son, takes his mother home after the funeral ale.

In a five-season major league career, he played for the Philadelphia Phillies and the St. Louis Browns. He was officially listed as standing and weighing . After opening his minor league career in the Chicago Cubs system, Hansen was purchased by the Phillies in 1930, playing for them that season and from 1932 to 1935. He won 22 games and lost 44 for the Philadelphia club, posting a 4.84 earned run average in 599 innings and splitting time between the starting rotation and the bullpen. Late in his major league career, he played a short time for the Browns, losing one game before returning to the minors at the end of his career. Early years Roy Emil Frederick Hansen was born in Chicago on February 21, 1907. He acquired his nickname during his first spring training with the Chicago Cubs, when the team prepared for the season on Catalina Island, southwest of Los Angeles. Jim Vitti, author of The Cubs on Catalina, told of Hansen's trip to the bottom of a canyon on the island, led by two teammates who gave him a burlap bag and disappeared, ostensibly to flush out the snipe. Hours later, he returned to the hotel \\"where he found the entire Cub team waiting for him in the lobby, falling over with laughter\\". The \\"Snipe\\" moniker remained with him for the remainder of his career. Minor leagues Hansen was signed by the Cubs for a tryout in 1927, described by the Miami News as \\"the first native son hurler to reseive a tryout in a long time\\". Chicago assigned him to their double-A affiliate, the Reading Keystones, where he appeared in 34 games during the 1927 season. Notching the team's third-worst winning percentage (.111) with one win against eight losses, he amassed a 6.99 earned run average (ERA), allowing 99 runs in 94 innings pitched. Hansen was reported to be on the Reading staff again during 1928's spring training, with the Keystones still anticipating his arrival as late as mid-April, but he played the entire 1928 season for the unaffiliated Elmira Colonels, posting a 12-17 win-loss record in 229 innings (37 games; tied for most pitching appearances on the club). Hansen led the Colonels in runs allowed, earned runs, and walks, allowing 241 hits on the season and collecting a 4.14 ERA. In 1929, Hansen re- surfaced with Chicago on the way to spring training at Catalina, and spent that season in the minor leagues with the Dayton Aviators, where he accumulated a 5.16 ERA (105 earned runs in 150 innings), winning seven games and losing eleven. He struck out 78 batters that season against 68 walks, allowing 166 hits. After spending the first three months of the 1930 season with the Richmond Roses, where he posted an 11-9 record and a 4.50 ERA in 162 innings, Hansen was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies. Major leagues =1930: Major league debut= Hansen made his first Phillies appearance on July 5, 1930, pitching five innings in the first game of a doubleheader against the Boston Braves. He allowed three runs (one earned) in his first contest, striking out four batters and walking two. His next four games, however, all resulted in defeats; Hansen gave up the losing run to the New York Giants out of the bullpen on July 7, and started his next three contests, losing all three to drop his major league record of 0-4. In two more July contests, he lost one more game, raising his ERA for the month to 5.25. In August, Hansen posted his first scoreless major league appearance, but lost one more game in four starts and allowed a season-high 14 hits in innings on August 29. Hansen's ERA continued to climb in September, reaching a season high of 6.80 on September 23 after he allowed 16 runs in 7 September appearances. After a scoreless appearance in his final game of the season, Hansen's final statistics for the major league portion of his 1930 season consisted of an 0-7 record, a 6.72 ERA, and 25 strikeouts against 38 walks. =1931-1932: Between minors and majors= In 1931, Hansen played the entire year for two Class-A minor league teams: the Dallas Steers and the Fort Worth Panthers, for whom he posted a 16-9 record and a 2.66 ERA, posting 87 walks. His option was picked up by the Phillies in September, and he was recalled to Philadelphia in spring of 1932. That year, Hansen was the Phillies' third starter and led the rotation in ERA, with a 3.72 mark as its youngest regular pitcher by five years. In his second appearance of the season, Hansen started against the Giants, losing the game when he allowed six runs in inning. He atoned the next day, however, when he started against the Giants, pitching a complete game, allowing one earned run, and lowering his ERA from 16.20 to 3.38; Hansen's contest was called a \\"remarkable comeback\\" by the Reading Eagle. He made three starts in May, winning one game and losing one, and notched his first save of the year on May 15 against the Cubs. After repeating the same 1-1 record in June, Hansen won two games and lost three in July, posting his second complete game in his final appearance of the month. He collected a second save on August 2, and earned a decision in nine of his final ten appearances through August and September, winning one more game than he lost to draw his final record for the season to 10-10. He struck out 56 batters on the year against 51 walks, completing five games in 23 starts (39 appearances). =1933: Young gun= Still the youngest member of Philadelphia's rotation, Hansen began the 1933 season pitching out of the Phillies bullpen, making five appearances before his first start. On May 21, he pitched a complete game, losing to the Cincinnati Reds when he allowed four runs through eight innings. His next two decisions, both starts, were also losses, dropping his record to 0-3. Hansen did win his first game in June, however, and lost his fourth on June 24, beginning a string of consecutive decisions. He earned victories in his next three starts, all of which were complete games; in the second contest, he pitched 11 consecutive innings to defeat the Reds. Hansen lost his next two starts before earning his only save of the season on August 2. In his final 11 appearances of that season, Hansen won two games and lost eight, eschewing a decision only once on August 26, to finish the season with a 6-14 record; he walked 30 batters, the lowest number in the starting rotation, but collected that group's second-worst ERA (4.44) and winning percentage (.300). =1934: Transition to bullpen= Although a reliever in 1934, Hansen still out-started the Phillies' fourth starting pitcher, alt=A baseball-card image of a man wearing a baseball cap and white baseball jersey In the 1934 season, Hansen transitioned to a relief pitcher's role, although he still made more starts than Ed Holley, the fourth member of the Phillies' starting rotation. He was second only to Curt Davis in appearances on the team that year, and led the team's relievers in innings pitched (151). That year, Hansen earned his first victory in a complete-game performance against the Braves on May 1, allowing six runs in an 11-6 contest. His next appearance, however, resulted in a loss when he allowed eight runs (five earned) on seven hits against the Cubs. Hansen notched two saves in the next month: one on May 20, and the second on June 3; he was saddled with his second loss against Chicago on June 14. In July, he won two games (July 4 and 14)--the latter the first complete-game shutout of his career--lost three (July 6, 12, and 27), and saved one (July 7); August was less successful, when he amassed a record of 1-3. Hansen clinched his second career shutout with a 1-0 win over Cincinnati on September 2, but lost four more games in the month against a lone win for a final record of 6-12. For the year, he struck out 40 batters and walked a career-high 61, posting a 5.42 ERA and allowing a career- worst 112 runs. He was one of ten pitchers to lead the National League in fielding percentage with a perfect 1.000 mark. =1935: Three-team trades= Hansen opened the 1935 season by allowing two runs to the Brooklyn Dodgers in innings on April 16. A week later, he faced Brooklyn again, this time allowing five runs (four earned) in three innings. Hansen earned his first loss of the season in the latter game, the only start he made that year. He remained with the Phillies, unused, until he was traded to the Washington Senators on May 10 for Ray Prim and Tommy Thomas. Washington traded Hansen to the St. Louis Browns four weeks later for future considerations, and he made his debut against the Senators on June 15, allowing three runs in four innings. His next two outings yielded similar results: three runs allowed in each, but both games were single-inning affairs for Hansen. In the team's final June contest, he allowed ten runs (nine earned) to the Detroit Tigers in an 18-1 St. Louis loss. Hansen's fortunes seemed to reverse in July, as he allowed only a single run through his first four outings of the month; however, that run he gave up earned him his second loss of the season, although it was an unearned tally. Used in both games of a doubleheader during his final two outings, he pitched a scoreless innings in the early game but allowed six runs in the nightcap, resulting in his return to Washington. For the remainder of the 1935 season, Hansen played for the Senators' minor league affiliates in Chattanooga and Albany, where he collected a 7-10 record and a 4.28 ERA. Late career Hansen played for the Steers again in 1936, but made only two appearances, losing both games. In 1937, he played for the Oklahoma City Indians and the Galveston Buccaneers, winning 5 games in 17 appearances in his final season. He allowed 77 hits in 75 innings, walking 46 batters and collecting a 4.44 ERA before retiring. Hansen died on September 11, 1978, in his hometown of Chicago and was interred at Rosehill Cemetery.

Plot  After leaving work one evening, a 20-year- old art student named Amy Manning (Kathleen Beller) finds out while driving home that the mysterious man in black who sneaks up on her repeatedly is in her backseat. Even though he has the opportunity to kill her, he tells her \\"Soon, Amy, soon\\" and then leaves. The police are no longer willing to help her, and although her stepmother Adele (Mariette Hartley) tells her she believes her, she advises her to visit a psychiatrist, Dr. Letterman (Keir Dullea). To him she admits that her father drowned a year ago during a boating accident. She was supposed to attend him on his trip, but canceled, and has felt guilty ever since. One day, she finds a package in the post with a card that reads \\"Soon, Amy, soon\\". With Adele, she traces the origin of the package, leading to a florist (Milton Selzer) who claims that she made the order herself. Adele contacts James Lockwood, attorney and best friend of Amy's father (Arlen Dean Snyder) to discuss Amy's situation, but she overhears this and runs off to college in anger. There, the mysterious man shows up again and terrifies her, as she tries to escape, until lawyer student David Norland (Gary Graham) appears. Returning to psychiatrist Letterman, Amy is told that her subconscious is making up the killer. She believes him, and decides to return to the place where her father died - a cabin in the woods - to face her guilt. Originally, Adele accompanies her, but a sudden meeting with James forces her to leave. During this meeting, James tells her that he heard from Letterman that Amy is suicidal. Considering that she will receive her father's estate when she turns 21 in three months, it would leave them penniless. Adele puts up an act as though she only cares about Amy's well- being, but it later turns out that she set everything up to drive Amy insane, with Letterman posing as the mysterious man. Letterman, meanwhile, has gone to the cabin, and after a struggle, he sedates Amy and puts her on a boat, pushing her into the river. Afterwards, he comforts Adele, who feels somewhat guilty due to her recent bonding with Amy. Shortly later, strange events start to occur to Adele in the mansion, such as locked doors that suddenly open, and a sculpture of Amy that disappears. She becomes convinced that someone is messing with her, but Letterman convinces her that she is imaginating it all. One night, she is determined that she is hearing Amy's cries, until she receives a phone call from James, informing her that Amy's body has been found. The following night, Adele is startled when Amy suddenly appears before her door. Around the same time, Letterman arrives, and Adele, thinking his attempts to enter her room are Amy's, shoots through the door, killing him. It turns out that Amy's death was a set-up from James, David and Amy to eventually scare her into the confession of killing Amy's father. Shortly after Adele's arrest, Amy is happy to celebrate her two months with David. In the final scene, David whispers \\"Soon, Amy, soon\\". At the end of the movie, Amy wakes up to find out that it was all just a dream...or was it?

Bucklin as Driver Production No Place to Hide was the first film in which Kathleen Beller did not portray a teenager: \\"It's wonderful not to push younger.

I've had so much trouble convincing people of age that it's a compliment.\\"\\"'No Place to Hide' role lets Kathleen Beller act her age\\" by Jerry Buck, Wilmington Morning Star, March 4, 1981. p. 5C Beller admitted that when she met director John Llewellyn Moxey, she \\"was intimidated by him\\" and that he \\"almost talked me out of the role\\": \\"I told him I didn't want to play the same little girl again. He said I didn't have to play it that way. We got into a philosophical discussion and when I left I thought I wouldn't do the role\\".\\" According to Beller, filming went smoothly, and the cast showed up every day an hour early to rehearse. She recalled working with Mariette Hartley as \\"wonderful\\", because \\"she lightened up the whole set\\". Hartley especially liked working with Keir Dullea and said in an interview with Playboy: :\\"I was doing a necking scene with Keir for the TV movie No Place to Hide. We necked the whole day. I was so turned on by the end of the afternoon that I rushed home to my poor husband. [..] Then, the next week, the same thing happened. Keir and I necked all day, and by the time I was off the free-way, whammo!

The income loss covered may be due to disaster-related closing of the business facility or due to the rebuilding process after a disaster. It differs from property insurance in that a property insurance policy only covers the physical damage to the business, while the additional coverage allotted by the business interruption policy covers the profits that would have been earned. This extra policy provision is applicable to all types of businesses, as it is designed to put a business in the same financial position it would have been in if no loss had occurred. This type of coverage can be added onto the business' property insurance policy or comprehensive package policy such as a business owner's policy (BOP) or as part of a standalone policy in some jurisdictions. Since business interruption is included as part of the business' primary policy, it only pays out if the cause of the loss is covered by the overarching policy or a defined event in the case of a standalone. Coverage The following are typically covered under a business interruption insurance policy: * Profits. Profits that would have been earned (based on prior months' financial statements). * Fixed costs. Operating expenses and other costs still being incurred by the property (based on historical costs). * Temporary location. Some policies cover the extra expenses for moving to, and operating from, a temporary location. * Commission and training cost. Business Interruption (BI) policy essentially covers the cost of providing training to the operators of the machinery replaced by the insurer following the insured events. * Extra expenses. Reimbursement for reasonable expenses (beyond the fixed costs) that allow the business to continue operation while the property is being repaired. * Civil authority ingress / egress. Government-mandated closure of business premises that directly causes loss of revenue. Examples include forced business closures because of government-issued curfews or street closures related to a covered event. This coverage extends until the end of the business interruption period determined by the insurance policy. Most insurance policies define this period as starting on the date of the covered peril and the damaged property is physically repaired and returned to operations under the same condition that existed prior to the disaster. In addition, businesses can purchase contingent business interruption coverage, which pays out when a business is unable to operate because of an event (such as a natural disaster) that damages the business premises of one of its suppliers or customers, thus preventing it from engaging in normal trade.

A dry toilet (or non-flush toilet, no flush toilet or toilet without a flush) is a toilet that operates without flush water, unlike a flush toilet. The dry toilet may have a raised pedestal on which the user can sit, or a squat pan over which the user squats in the case of a squat toilet. In both cases, the excreta (both urine and feces) falls through a drop hole. A dry toilet can be any of the following types of toilets: a composting toilet, urine-diverting dry toilet, arborloo, container-based toilet, bucket toilet, simple pit latrine (but not those that operate on a \\"pour flush\\" basis), incinerating toilets, or freezing toilets. The urine and feces can either become mixed at the point of dropping or stay separated, which is called urine diversion.  Types  There are several types of toilets which are referred to as \\"dry toilets\\". All of them work without flush water and without a connection to a sewer system or septic tank: * Composting toilet (in most cases without urine diversion but can also be with urine diversion) * Urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT) ‚Äì with urine diversion, as the name implies * Arborloo ‚Äì which is similar to a pit latrine but has a much shallower pit and is designed for making compost in the pit * Treebog - a low-tech compost toilet consisting of a raised platform above a compost pile surrounded by densely planted willow trees or similar. * Container-based toilet - where human excreta is collected in sealable, removable containers (also called cartridges) that are transported to treatment facilities (a sub-type are \\"packaging toilets\\" where feces from each defecation event is placed in its own package) * Bucket toilet ‚Äì a very basic type of dry toilet consisting only of a bucket which could be upgraded with urine diversion and the use of covering material * Simple pit latrines: those pit latrines that do not have a water seal (pour flush pit latrines have a water seal and are therefore not dry toilets). * Incinerating toilets, freezing toilets ‚Äì these are toilets with more complicated technology and higher costs Other types of dry toilets are under development at universities, for example since 2012 funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Such toilets are meant to operate off-the-grid without connections to water, sewer, or electrical lines. =Terminology= One important source states that the term \\"dry toilet\\" should only refer to the \\"user interface\\" and not the subsequent storage and treatment steps. However, in the WASH sector, the term \\"dry toilet\\" is still used differently by different people. It often includes also the storage and treatment steps. For example, it is common that the term \\"dry toilet\\" is used to refer specifically to a urine- diverting dry toilet or a composting toilet.Platzer, C., Hoffmann, H., Ticona, E. (2008). Alternatives to waterborne sanitation - a comparative study ‚Äì limits and potentials. IRC Symposium: Sanitation for the urban poor - partnerships and governance, Delft, The NetherlandsFlores, A. (2010). Towards sustainable sanitation: evaluating the sustainability of resource-oriented sanitation. PhD Thesis, University of Cambridge, UK People also use the term to refer to a pit latrine without a water seal even though the pit of a pit latrine is not usually dry. The pit can become very wet because urine mixes with feces in the pit and drainage might be limited. Also, groundwater or surface water can also get into the pit in the event of heavy rains or flooding. Sometimes households even discard greywater (from showering) into the same pit. Some publications use the term \\"dry sanitation\\" to denote a system that includes dry toilets (in particular urine-diverting dry toilets) connected to a system to manage the excreta. However, this term is not in widespread use nowadays, and might rather be replaced with \\"non sewer-based sanitation\\" or \\"non-sewered sanitation\\" (see also fecal sludge management). The term \\"outhouse\\" refers to a small structure, separate from a main building, which covers a pit toilet or a dry toilet. Although it strictly refers only to the structure above the toilet, it is often used to denote the entire toilet structure, i.e. including the hole in the ground in the case of a pit latrine. =Gallery= File:Cleaning a urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT) in Johannesburg (2947142348).jpgA urine-diverting dry toilet, with a funnel to catch urine.

Rear chamber for dispensing of cover material. Henry Moule's earth closet design, 1909. Dry toilets (in particular simple pit latrines) are used in developing countries in situations in which flush toilets connected to septic tanks or sewer systems are not possible or not desired, for example due to costs. Sewerage infrastructure costs can be very high in instances of unfavorable terrain or sprawling settlement patterns. Dry toilets (in particular composting toilets) are also used in rural areas of developed countries, e.g. many Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway) for summer houses and in national parks.  Advantages  Dry toilets can be a suitable alternative to water flushed toilets when water for flushing is of short supply.Rieck, C., von M√ºnch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) ‚Äì Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany Another reason for using dry toilets can be that the infrastructure to deal with the wastewater produced from flush toilets is too expensive to construct. Dry toilets are used for three main reasons instead of flush toilets: # To save water ‚Äì when there is either water scarcity, water is costly (such as in arid or semi-arid climates) or because the user wants to save water for environmental reasons. However, water savings from dry toilets might be insignificant compared to other possible water savings in households or within agricultural practices. #To prevent pollution of surface water or groundwater ‚Äì dry toilets do not mix excreta with water and do not pollute groundwater (except for pit latrines which may pollute groundwater); they do not contribute to eutrophication in surface water bodies. # To enable safe reuse of excreta, after the collected excreta or fecal sludge has undergone further treatment for example by drying or composting. Dry toilets and excreta management without sewers can offer more flexibility in construction than flush toilet and sewer-based systems. It can be a suitable system to adapt to climate change scenarios in desert-like areas like Lima, Peru.  Challenges  Dry toilets do not have a water seal, thus odors may be a problem. This is often the case for pit latrines, UDDTs or composting toilets if they are not designed well or not used properly. Dry toilets that are connected to a pit (such as pit latrines) tend to make it very difficult to empty the pit in a safe manner when they are full (see fecal sludge management). On the other hand, dry toilets that are not connected to a pit (e.g. container-based toilets, UDDTs and composting toilets) usually have a safe method for emptying built into them as they are designed to be emptied on a regular and quite frequent basis (within days, weeks or months). = Urban settings = The use of dry toilets (in particular urine-diverting dry toilets) in urban settings of developed countries is very rare as they come with some significant social and technical challenges. Legal acceptability and support at the local policy level amongst the various government departments involved might be very low for dry toilets.  History  The history of dry toilets is essentially the same as the history of toilets in general (until the advent of flush toilets) as well as the history of ecological sanitation systems with regards to reuse of excreta in agriculture. =Dry earth closets= Example of a historical dry toilet with peat dispenser which was used in bunkers during World War II in Berlin (Metroclo by Gefinal) Dry earth closets were invented by English clergyman Henry Moule, who dedicated his life to improving public sanitation after witnessing the cholera epidemics of 1849 and 1854. Impressed by the insalubrity of the houses, especially during the Great Stink in the summer of 1858, he invented what he called the 'dry earth system'. In partnership with James Bannehr, he patented his device (No. 1316, dated 28 May 1860). Among his works bearing on the subject were The Advantages of the Dry Earth System (1868), The Impossibility overcome: or the Inoffensive, Safe, and Economical Disposal of the Refuse of Towns and Villages (1870), The Dry Earth System (1871), Town Refuse, the Remedy for Local Taxation (1872), and National Health and Wealth promoted by the general adoption of the Dry Earth System (1873). His system was adopted in private houses, in rural districts, in military camps, in many hospitals, and extensively in the British Raj. Ultimately, however, it failed to gain public support as attention turned to the water-flushed toilet connected to a sewer system. In Germany, a dry toilet with a peat dispenser was marketed until after the Second World War. It was called \\"Metroclo\\" and was manufactured by Gefinal, Berlin. = Great Britain = In Britain, use of dry toilets continued in some areas, often urban areas, through to the 1940s. It seems that these were often emptied directly onto their gardens, where the excreta was used as fertilizer. Sewer systems did not come to some rural areas in Britain until the 1950s or even after that. = Australia = Brisbane, Australia was largely unsewered until the early 1970s, with many suburbs having a dry toilet (called a dunny) behind each house. Academic George Seddon claimed that \\"the typical Australian back yard in the cities and country towns\\" had, throughout the first half of the twentieth century, \\"a dunny against the back fence, so that the pan could be collected from the dunny lane through a trap-door\\".

Built in 1962‚Äì1963, its public use specializes in boating and extracurricular marine activities for the local community and visitors. The harbor straddles the city limits which runs down the center of Arana Gulch; the west side of the harbor is in Santa Cruz's Seabright neighborhood while the east is in unincorporated Santa Cruz County. The harbor is split into two portions: the south or \\"lower\\" harbor and the north or \\"upper\\" harbor. The lower harbor was completed first and provides slips up to 60', and is itself split into an east and a west side. The west lower harbor contains docks AA, A‚ÄìF, and FF; sailboat dry storage and hoist launch; a hand launch ramp for small, lightweight craft; and a small Coast Guard facility. It is adjacent to the Santa Cruz Yacht Club. It hosts a mixture of sail and power craft, and is the location for most of the harbor's slips over 40 feet. It is accessed off of Seabright and Atlantic avenues. The east lower harbor has docks L‚ÄìT, a boatyard, the harbor offices, a launch ramp, the harbor's fuel dock, and a number of harbor-related businesses. Most of the commercial fishing fleet is berthed there, including facilities for off-loading fish. Access is from 5th Avenue and East Cliff Drive; a water taxi connects the east and west lower harbor during the summer months. The upper harbor is separated from the lower by two fixed bridges; one carrying Murray St, the other a railroad line. Due to the limited clearance, powerboats and smaller sailboats comprise most of the boats docked in the upper harbor; many of the sailboats must lower their masts to pass under. Docks G‚ÄìJ and U‚ÄìX provide slips to 45'. The upper harbor also contains the harbor's maintenance base, two dry storage areas, and the harbor's RV park. Access to the upper harbor is from 7th Avenue.  Recreation  Photo of kayakers just outside the santa cruz harbor. Visitors to the Santa Cruz harbor will find over 1,000 moored vessels available for commercial, recreational, or research opportunities. A boat dock and several launching facilities are also available to day visitors looking to rent kayaks, paddle boards, or boats from nearby businesses. Charter services are available for visitors interested in whale watching, fishing, or other marine activities. Outside of the water, the harbor is home to walking and hiking trails throughout historic Monterey Bay as well as an RV parking facility.  A harbor of refuge  Photo of a seagull floating outside the Santa Cruz harbor. Photo of giant kelp floating just outside the Santa Cruz harbor The Santa Cruz Harbor promotes the extracurricular enjoyment of marine actives as well as the preservation of local marine life. The harbor is part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the largest marine sanctuary in the United States. The marine sanctuary is home to 26 species of marine mammals, 94 species of seabirds, 345 species of fish, 4 species of turtles, 31 phyla invertebrates, and over 450 species of marine algae and plants. Seasonal visitors to the Santa Cruz Harbor may see many different species of whales, sea otters, giant kelp and more. History Between 1958 and 1960, the State Department of Parks and Recreation began acquiring land for the harbor and its supporting parking and concession areas. In 1962, Congress appropriated $1.6 million for jetty construction and the dredging of the original south harbor basin. Construction actually began on the south harbor in 1962, with the facility being completed in 1964, when 360 slips were dedicated. On March 11, 2011, Santa Cruz harbor was struck by a tsunami from the 9.0 magnitude earthquake that hit Japan. Governance The Santa Cruz Harbor is governed by five Commissioners who are elected to four year terms. Elections are held for either two or three of the commission positions each November (California Harbors & Navigation Code ¬ß6240.5). The commissioners in turn select a port district director who runs the affairs of the harbor. Current Port District Director Marian Olin was preceded by Lisa Ekers, Rick Smith, and Brian Foss. Santa Cruz Anchorage The Santa Cruz Anchorage is the area to the east of Point Santa Cruz, west of the Santa Cruz Breakwater Light, and south of Cowell's, Main, and Seabright beaches. The anchorage is protected to the north and west but exposed to the south, and is a popular place for boats to anchor. It contains the Santa Cruz Wharf, where a public landing exits for users to come ashore, and is immediately south of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk amusement park. The anchorage was previously labelled as the \\"Santa Cruz Harbor\\" on charts, while the marina was labelled the \\"Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor\\". To reduce confusion the name was changed in 2003 when a new revision of the Monterey Bay chart was published.

The goal of the group is to create a complete interoperable RF technology to exchange data for wireless sensor networks and devices at a block scale (300m‚Äì1 km). Initially created with the participation of the US DoD and Lockheed Martin in 2009, the group evolved from RFID military needs (ISO-18000-7 support group role), to an industrial generic requirement. The Dash7 Alliance continued to forge an extensive experience in high reliability 433 MHz networks and extended it to 868/915 MHz. Unlike other protocols, Dash7 Alliance published layered based protocols to ensure interoperability up to the file exchange layers. A complete Open Source implementation, OSS-7, as well as industrial implementations enabled to create a certification lab and organize regular plugfest. The DASH7 Alliance was a privately held, 501(c)3 not-for-profit trade association founded in February 2009 and headquartered in San Ramon, California. Since 2015, it is a European NGO based in Brussels, Belgium. DASH7 Technology DASH7 wireless sensor networking technology is operating in the license-free sub GHz spectrum. Primarily relying on 433 MHz, the protocol now mostly addresses 868/915 MHz frequencies to reduce antenna size and increase throughput. DASH7 has multi-kilometer range, multi-year battery life, sensor and security support, direct device-to-device communications. The bitrate ranges from 9.6kbit/s up to 167kbit/s, with a latency under 15 ms to deliver a packet (including LBT). DASH7 devices operate on a single global frequency and are interoperable regardless of application and by design do not require cumbersome application profiles. Unlike most wireless networks, DASH7 doesn't require a gateway/node controller to operate. DASH7 V1.0 targets scalability : begin with two low cost devices and grow a network linearly. The DASH7 protocol is not built around IP layers. It is a bridge between RFID and IoT. Very low power, small memory footprint and above 100 000 devices per area are possible. With the availability of the open source reference implementation, OSS-7, DASH7 is one of the most efficient way to enable RF/IoT research labs to gain access to an opened RF technologies. Different tools are available to help adopters quickly learn and integrate DASH7 ( Raspberry Pi shield, Arduino, ARM mbed library, etc.) ... History Upon receiving awards for the U.S. Department of Defense‚Äôs RFID III contract for ISO 18000-7 devices, several companies ‚Äì Savi Technology, Evigia Systems, and Identec Solutions ‚Äì started a more formalized process for determining conformance with the ISO 18000-7 standard and interoperability across vendors. ISO has no provision for testing equipment for compliance with its standards. A founders meeting was organized by Savi Technology in February 2009 in Kona, Hawaii, and around this time the moniker ‚ÄúDASH7‚Äù was used to substitute for the much longer and more obscure ‚ÄúISO/IEC 18000-7:2004‚Äù. At this meeting, it was agreed the alliance should incorporate as an independent, non-profit trade association and collect member dues to fund its operations. In July 2010, the alliance announced the latest step in its interoperability certification initiative, making a series of test methods and scripts available to DASH7 developers. In July 2010, the alliance also announced that an update to the ISO 18000-7 standard had been submitted to ISO, dubbed DASH7 Mode 2, adding new features and capabilities to the technology. In July 2013, the DASH7 Alliance announced the DASH7 Alliance Protocol Draft 0.2. The alliance took into account the increasing demand for 868/915 MHz frequency extensions. In May 2015, the DASH7 Alliance publicly released the v1.0 of the DASH7 Alliance Protocol. This step brought a clear path for interoperability between products and high layer file management, as well as InSitu firmware upgrade. The Dash7 products have full management features, encryption and constraints to be field upgradable ( long term maintenance addressed )  Mission  :The purposes of the Alliance are: :* Manage the DASH7 Alliance specification (based on ISO 18000-7 and further evolution) in order to benefit overall market conditions and to foster interoperability of DASH7 based products and technologies. :* Provide an environment where its Members may meet to discuss and approve suggested revisions and enhancements that evolve the relevant specifications for protocol standards respecting the Alliance IPR policy. :* Provide a forum where users may meet with developers and providers of related products and services to identify requirements for interoperability and general usability of DASH7 specification :* Promote the DASH7 Alliance specification and educate the business and consumer communities as to the value, benefits and applications for such interoperable consumer and commercial products. :* Protect the needs of users and increase competition among vendors by supporting the creation and implementation of uniform conformance test procedures and processes to foster the interoperability of products and services. :* Once applicable, make appropriate submission of the specifications to international standardization agencies, for ratification, approval and adoption of such specifications as an official national or international standard by such agencies or bodies. Organization The DASH7 Alliance consists of three main working groups overseen by a board of directors. ;Protocol Action Group: Study requirements, results of previous generations of DASH7, and propose improvements to the protocol. Both for low layers and upper layers. ;University Action Group: DASH7 relies on industrial requirements to focus on goals and performance targets. Advanced research and evolution are led mostly by universities active on topics like RF propagation studies, protocol optimization, fault tolerance in noisy environments, etc. The UAG brings skills from IoT laboratories to compare different behavior of radio technologies in dense urban areas. ;Outreach Working Group: Gathers end user requirements for submittal to the outreach working group and also leads all public outreach for the Alliance. The OWG is also responsible to showcase different use cases in order to help industries, cities, universities evaluate the added value of DASH7 for their context. The OWG historically targeted first sea containers, logistic and, since 2013 focuses on sensor networks and \\"Smart Infrastructure\\" with the help of the new DASH7 1.0 protocol. Certification program The DASH7 Alliance manages test, plugfest, and certification program required for any product using DASH7 wireless technology. The program was designed to ensure maximum commitment to open standards and ease of use. A flexible path between experimental use and full interoperability qualification ensures a fast and smooth evolution during deployment of DASH7 based products. The certification lab, in Belgium, validates RF physical layer as well as API compliance with the specification ( DASH7 modems are interchangeable for standard commands). Membership The DASH7 Alliance is opened to companies, universities or state bodies willing to get support to deploy, use or develop Dash7 based wireless networks. The Alliance organizes several meetings per year. Membership is mandatory for product manufacturer willing to use the DASH7 name. Intellectual property New DASH7 specifications are considered the intellectual property of the DASH7 Alliance and remain accessible only to DASH7 Alliance members until they become public knowledge during an ISO or IEEE standardization process. The DASH7 Alliance has a reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing intellectual property policy, which is the same policy as both ISO and IEEE. The DASH7 Alliance owns the DASH7 trademarks. The \\"DASH7 Certified\\" trademark is licensed out for use to companies that are incorporating DASH7 wireless technology into their certified products. A DASH7 Member trademark is also available to paying members of the alliance. To become a licensee of any DASH7 trademark, a company must become a member of the DASH7 Alliance.

She served during the Second World War in the Battle of the Atlantic, taking part in the sinking of the German U-boat in 1944. Initially ordered by the British Royal Navy as Sandgate Castle, the ship was transferred to Canada before completion. Following the war, the corvette was converted for mercantile use and renamed Camosun III, then Chilcotin and Yukon Star in 1958 before being broken up in Washington in 1974. Design and description The Castle class were an improved corvette design over their predecessor . The Flower class was not considered acceptable for mid-Atlantic sailing and was only used on Atlantic convoy duty out of need. Though the Admiralty would have preferred s, the inability of many small shipyards to construct the larger ships required them to come up with a smaller vessel. The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessorsChesneau, p.63 and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p.142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p.127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings). The ships were powered by two Admiralty three-drum boilers which created . This powered one vertical triple expansion engine that drove one shaft, giving the ships a maximum speed of . The ships carried 480 tons of oil giving them a range of at . The corvettes were armed with one QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun mounted forward.Mk XIX = Mark 19. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p.126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC. The Type 147B was tied to the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing. A single Squid-launched attack had a success rate of 25%.Brown 2012, p.129 The class was also provided with HF/DF and Type 277 radar. Construction and career The British Admiralty ordered as Sandgate Castle, after the castle in Kent, on 19 January 1943 and allocated her the pennant number K373. She was built at Smiths Dock Company and launched on 28 December 1943,Macpherson and Barrie, p.166 but was never commissioned into the Royal Navy. Instead, she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. St. Thomas was named for the city of St. Thomas, Ontario in Canada and was commissioned on 4 May 1944 with the pennant number K488. Her first captain was Lieutenant Commander Leslie Perman Denny, RCNR. Of the ship's complement, at least five were from St. Thomas, and about a dozen from Elgin County. Her primary mission was to escort convoys across the North Atlantic to Britain. After working up at Tobermory she joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-3 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. St. Thomas escorted 13 convoys across the North Atlantic in 1944‚Äì1945. =Sinking of U-877= St. Thomas is credited with the sinking of , a German submarine on 27 December 1944. The battle took place north-west of the Azores in position 46¬∫25'N, 36¬∫38'W, off the coast of Newfoundland. St. Thomas twice detected and carried out attacks on the U-boat using her Squid forward-throwing anti-submarine mortar. St. Thomas had begun to withdraw, when the damaged U-boat was discovered to have surfaced away. Rather than attacking a third time, the Canadian First Lieutenant (second-in-command), Stanislas D√©ry, ordered the crew, \\"Ne tirez pas\\" (Don't shoot). Instead, St. Thomas and rescued all 56 members of the German crew. Shortly afterwards U-877 sank. The German second-in-command was credited with calling D√©ry every year to thank him for saving his life. The sinking of U-877 encouraged Canadians that their ships could successfully engage the modern U-boats. Her second, and last captain was Lieutenant Commander Berkeley Hynes, RCNVR, who commanded St. Thomas from 27 January 1945 until shortly before her decommissioning late that same year. She returned to Canada in April 1945 and underwent a refit at Halifax, Nova Scotia beginning on 30 April. After the refit was completed she sailed to Esquimalt, British Columbia in July and remained there until being paid off on 22 November 1945. =Postwar service= Following the war St. Thomas was sold into mercantile service and converted to a coastal passenger/cargo ship with a gross register tonnage of 1,835 tons. Initially renamed Camosun III in 1946 and owned by Union Steamships Ltd., the ship was renamed Chilcotin in 1958 before being sold to Alaska Cruise Lines Ltd and renamed again to Yukon Star in 1958. In 1970, Yukon Star was sold to West Line Ltd and hulked for use as a floating hotel in Tacoma, Washington.Colledge, p. 553 The ship was sold to J. Gadison Machinery Ltd. in 1974 before being sold again that year to General Metals of Tacoma Inc. and broken up at Tacoma. The original ship's bell from St. Thomas was donated to the city of St. Thomas in the late 1940s.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 2010. In this episode, Krusty the Clown invites Homer to the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony in Oslo, Norway. Later turning out to be a hoax, Krusty is sued by the International Court of Justice for his many instances of public indecency. Meanwhile, Marge takes Lisa to a performing arts camp for a week. The episode was written by Tim Long and directed by Mark Kirkland. Upon airing, it was met with mixed reception from television critics. \\"Elementary School Musical\\" was viewed by 7.8 million viewers and attained a 3.7/8 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode features guest appearances from Lea Michele, Amber Riley, Cory Monteith, Jemaine Clement, Bret McKenzie, Ira Glass, and Stephen Hawking. Plot As Homer, Lisa, and her friends watch the announcement of the year's Nobel Prize winners, they are astounded to hear that Krusty the Clown has won the Peace Prize. Krusty picks Homer to accompany him to Oslo for the awards ceremony, and Homer decides to take Bart with him. Their plane lands in The Hague, and it is revealed that the Peace Prize announcement was a ruse to bring Krusty there so he could be tried by the International Court of Justice for his deplorable public behavior over the years, such as dropping a monkey from the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and stealing the act from a local clown in The Hague. Homer and Bart search desperately for any evidence to show that Krusty has made a genuine contribution to humanity, and eventually argue that his refusal to perform at Sun City because he wanted potato chips led directly to the South African government's decision to release Nelson Mandela from prison. Even though these two incidents are not connected in any way, the court accepts this argument and frees Krusty, who immediately seeks out the nearest place to buy marijuana ‚Äî the courthouse cafeteria. Meanwhile, Marge surprises Lisa by sending her to a performing arts camp for a week. She eagerly immerses herself there in music and theater, meeting several campers who love to break into song and two guitar-playing hipster counselors, Ethan and Kurt. When Marge takes her home at the end of the week, Lisa has trouble readjusting to normal life and looks for a chance to express her newly awakened creative side. She runs away from home and seeks out Ethan and Kurt in \\"Sprooklyn\\", described by the counselors as the \\"artistic hotbed of Springfield\\". However, she soon learns that they have grossly exaggerated the area, which is really a run-down slum, and that they actually work at a sandwich shop. They sing a song about the difficulties of being an artist, during which Krusty gets beaten up for accidentally announcing he is the prison snitch. Ethan and Kurt encourage her to return to her family and think about trying to make an artistic name for herself when she is older. As Marge arrives to take Lisa home, Ethan and Kurt show off a mural that they have painted in her honor, which takes up an entire side of a building. Production \\"Elementary School Musical\\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Mark Kirkland. The episode features guest appearances from Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, and Amber Riley from the Fox series Glee. The three previously revealed their appearances on Twitter in February 2010. Physicist Stephen Hawking also made an appearance. Flight of the Conchords members Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie first rehearsed their lines over the phone with Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, before flying to the United States to record their parts for the show. Clement, a fan of the show since it first aired as shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, said that he and McKenzie would play new characters, rather than themselves. He continued: > Yeah, we were over the moon. We don't play ourselves, because most people > won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow versions of ourselves. > We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. > We just went to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, we were really > flattered. The opening sequence features Otto Mann in a Partridge Family-like bus, while the chalkboard gag makes a reference to the film Inception. The Glee cast members sing a version of \\"Good Vibrations\\" by the Beach Boys. Krusty the Clown had a Super Bowl \\"nip slip\\", appeared on The Electric Company and was seen using a child as a human shield in a similar manner to the character Greg Stillson from The Dead Zone. Lisa listens to This American Life, a public radio program voiced by Ira Glass. Also, Ethan and Kurt have a map of Middle Earth on the wall of their apartment. Krusty's comment that \\"I ain't gonna play Sun City\\" is a reference to Steven van Zandt's famous protest song. Reception \\"Elementary School Musical\\" was initially broadcast on September 26, 2010 in the United States as part of the animation television night on Fox. Upon airing, the episode was viewed by 7.8 million households. \\"Elementary School Musical\\" garnered a 3.7/8 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, according to the Nielsen ratings. \\"Elementary School Musical\\" ranked twenty- third in the 18‚Äì49 demographic for the week. Television critics were polarized with \\"Elementary School Musical\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C+' grade. Although she expressed satisfaction towards many aspects of the episode, such as the character development of Lisa Simpson, VanDerWerff criticized the songs performed in the episode. In response to the appearance of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of the Flight of the Conchords, she stated: \\"I have no idea if the writers wrote new songs for the two guys in Flight of the Conchords to sing [...] but the songs they sang were pretty weak.\\" Similarly, VanDerWerff was critical of the guest appearances of Michele, Riley, and Monteith, and stated: \\"Bringing in the Glee kids to sing a take on \\"Good Vibrations\\" that was, frankly, awful mostly just felt like an attempt to have guest stars in nothing parts so they could be promoted. In contrast, Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt that the \\"Elementary School Musical\\" was an enjoyable start to the twenty-second season of the series, and retorted that the appearances of Clement and McKenzie was the highlight of the episode. Similarly, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic wrote, \\"We actually loved Bret and Jemaine doing what they do best last night: playing characterized versions of themselves. Unlike the Glee kids, our favorite duo from New Zealand were given decent songs and some pretty great lines.\\" Hochberger gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars.

The elaborate flint exterior is finely detailed in the Gothic style, especially around the windows. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History The ancient Sussex fishing village of Brighthelmston, which in the 18th and 19th centuries developed into the fashionable seaside resort of Brighton, lay within the Anglican Diocese of Chichester. In the 19th century, before the Elementary Education Act 1870 centralised the provision of primary-level education and established school boards, most 5- to 12-year-olds were taught (if at all) at schools founded and sponsored by charities, private benefactors or churches. There were many such church schools in Brighton: Anglican churches with their own schools included Christ Church, St Bartholomew's, St John the Evangelist's, St Mark's, St Martin's, St Paul's and St Stephen's. The Diocese established an institute to train female schoolteachers for the Anglican schools in Brighton and the rest of Sussex in Black Lion Street in The Lanes (the ancient heart of the town) in April 1842. This was done in association with the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church. More space was soon needed, so in 1854 it found a site on the west side of Ditchling Road on which to build a larger college. Ditchling Road, which ran across Ditchling Beacon to Ditchling village and then on to Cuckfield and eventually London, became a turnpike in 1770 and was thereafter one of the main north‚Äìsouth routes into and out of Brighton. The chosen site was on the north side of Viaduct Road, which was built to link Ditchling and London Roads and which formed the northern edge of Brighton's ecclesiastical parish and municipal borough until 1873. The architects William and Edward Habershon were commissioned to design the new building. They were based in London but worked extensively in Sussex; buildings they designed separately or together in the county include St Leonards-on-Sea Congregational Church, St John the Baptist's Church in Hove, St Helen's Church in Ore and St Augustine's Church at Scaynes Hill. They started work at the large corner site in 1854, and the building was ready later that year. The local firm of Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn extended the building to the rear (north side) in 1886. The west elevation, showing paired lancet windows rising beyond the roofline Teachers continued to be trained at the college (officially called the Chichester Diocesan Training College for Schoolmistresses) until 1939. As World War II approached, the institution closed and the building was auctioned; but before it could be sold, the Royal Engineers requisitioned it for their use during wartime. They used it as a base for their operations, then after the war it became their archives and records office. In 1987, they moved out, and the vacant building was threatened with demolition. A local campaign helped it receive listed status, offering a degree of protection, and the building's future was secured when it was bought and converted into a complex of serviced offices. It opened in November 1988 as the Brighton Business Centre, and was later renamed the Brighton Forum. The Brighton Forum was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 22 March 1988. This status is given to \\"nationally important buildings of special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Architecture The east elevation; the carriage arch is hidden behind the tree Brighton Forum is built on a high, prominent corner position, giving it good visibility from the west and south and long southward views. Knapped flint is the main building material, augmented by stone dressings and some yellow brickwork to the quoins. The roof is laid with tiles. The two-storey fa√ßade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a symmetrical seven-bay plan. The first and seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet windows on the sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a segmental arch which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls of the first and seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart. At first-floor level, similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline. The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, canted to form a 1‚Äì3‚Äì1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a segmental arch-shaped hood mould. Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery. The eastern face (to Ditchling Road) has eight bays and a carriage arch at the north end. The first four bays have trefoil-headed lancet windows, while the next four have simpler straight-headed windows. The carriage arch is segmental-headed. The first floor has eight dormers. On the west side, the roof is cross-gabled: the gables are parallel to, rather than perpendicular to, the ridge.

It differs from ovarian wedge resection, because resection involves the cutting of tissue. Minimally invasive ovarian drilling procedures have replaced wedge resections. Ovarian drilling is preferred to wedge resection because cutting in to the ovary can cause adhesions which may complicate postoperative outcomes. Ovarian drilling and ovarian wedge resection are treatment options to reduce the amount of androgen producing tissue in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is the primary cause of anovulation, which results in female infertility. The induction of mono-ovulatory cycles can restore fertility. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may improve the effectiveness of other ovulation induction treatments and results in lower multiple pregnancy rates than other treatment options like gonadotropins. The oral drug, clomiphene citrate (CC), is the first-line treatment for PCOS-related infertility, yet, one fifth of women are resistant to the drug and fail to ovulate. Patients are considered resistant if the treatment fails for 6 months at the appropriate dosage. Ovarian drilling is a surgical alternative to CC treatment or recommended for women with WHO Group II ovulation disorders. Other non-surgical medical options in the treatment of PCOS include the oestrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, insulin sensitising drugs, and hormonal ovarian stimulation. The effectiveness of the surgical procedure is similar to CC or gonadotropin treatment for induced ovulation for PCOS patients, but results in fewer multiple pregnancies per ongoing pregnancy regardless if the technique is unilaterally or bilaterally performed. If patients do not become pregnant 6 months after ovulation has been reestablished from ovarian drilling treatment, drug treatments may be reintroduced or in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be considered.  Hormonal Effects  Part of the criteria of PCOS diagnosis includes elevated levels of androgens in the bloodstream or other signs of androgen excess (hyperandrogenism). The procedure causes a drop in serum androgen levels and possibly in estrogen levels. After ovarian follicles and stroma are destroyed, there is a reduction in these hormone levels. The procedure results in a decrease in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and in pulsations as well as a periodic drop in inhibin B levels. The most plausible theory states that the reduction of these hormone concentrations leads to an increase in the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and sex hormone-binding globulin, leading to effective follicular maturation and ovulation. Low serum oestradiol concentrations are associated with decreased aromatase activity. Inflammatory growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 are produced due to injury and aid the effects of FSH through greater blood flow and gonadotropin delivery. Circulating and intrafollicular levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), which can help quantify recruitable ovarian follicle activity, are reduced after laparoscopic ovarian drilling in women with PCOS.  Procedures  When the clinician determines that ovarian drilling is appropriate and the woman decides to undergo this treatment, consent is obtained. The risks are communicated to the woman. The most commonly performed method is with a monopolar needle or hook because of the equipment's availability and simple installation. Other common instrumentation consists of the use of a bipolar electrical surgical electrodes or a CO2, argon, or ND-YAG laser. This instrumentation has the ability to produce the intended results with a very focal approach. Typically, a 100 W electrical cautery dissector is first used to cross the ovarian cortex, then electrocoagulation is performed at 40 W, however rates range from 30 to 400 W. The surgical punctures are performed on the ovarian cortex and are usually 4‚Äì10 mm deep and 3 mm wide. The number of punctures is related to subsequent ability to conceive--it has been found that five to ten punctures are more likely to produce the intended conception. Ovarian drilling is performed laparoscopically and either transumbilical (culdoscopy) or transvaginal (fertiloscopy).  Risks  Though preferable to creating incisions on the ovary, ovarian drilling does have some risks. These are: pelvic adhesion formation, hemorrhage, gas embolism, pneumothorax, premature ovarian failure, long-term ovarian function, developing hyperstimulation syndrome, adhesion formation, infertility and multiple births. Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) ovarian drilling may minimize the risk of iatrogenic adhesion formation and decreased ovarian reserve (DOR), which can impinge upon fertility. LOD does not contribute to the risk of decreased ovarian reserve. There is risk of electrical accidents with monopoly current. A rare complication of LOD is major vascular injury, mostly on the small vessels in the anterior abdominal wall when the Veress needle and trocar are inserted at the beginning of the procedure.  Advantages  Ovarian drilling has lower rates of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and of multi-fetal gestation. The advantages of the procedure also include its singular treatment, as opposed to several trials of ovulation inductions. Other benefits of this technique include cost- effectiveness and that it can be performed as an outpatient procedure.  History  Ovarian drilling was first used in the treatment of PCOS in 1984 and has evolved as a safe and effective surgery. After performing laparoscopic electrosurgical ovarian drilling in CC-resistant patients in 1984, Gj√∂nnaess found that this technique increased ovulation rates to 45 percent and pregnancy rates to 42 percent. In 1988, laparoscopic multiple punch resection of ovaries on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, slightly modified from Gj√∂nnaess's operation, caused a reduction in LH pulsation and pituitary responsiveness in the treatment of PCOS. In 1989, ovarian drilling was conducted with argon, carbon dioxide (CO2) or potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser vaporization causing spontaneous ovulation in 71 percent of those treated. The procedure has been modified and popularized in the treatment of patients with CC-resistance.

History 1890 - 2018  Polo was first played in the United States in 1876, introduced by James Gordon Bennett, Jr. (May 10, 1841 ‚Äì May 14, 1918), who had first observed the game played in England. Bennett came to be known as the father of American polo as it was he who assembled the players, knowledge, equipment and Texas horses to play the first loosely structured matches in the United States. During that winter of 1876, the first game was held indoors at Dickel's Riding Academy in New York and the first formal U.S. club was established, the Westchester Polo Club. Westchester alternated seasons between New York City and Newport, Rhode Island before making Newport its permanent home. On May 13, 1876, the Jerome Park Racetrack in Westchester County (future home of the New York Giants baseball team and hence the name ‚Äúpolo grounds‚Äù) was the site of the first outdoor polo match. Then in 1879 Meadowbrook became a polo club and began play on the Mineola fairgrounds of Long Island. The foundation had now been laid for American polo and the sport was here to stay and flourish. As players and teams proliferated, the development of the sport demanded a governing body. The Polo Association (later known as the United States Polo Association), with H.L. Herbert serving as first chairman, was founded March 21, 1890. The USPA's purpose was to coordinate games, standardize rules and establish handicaps. Mr. Herbert was credited with instituting a handicapping system in 1888 so that teams could be more evenly matched in games. His rating system is essentially the same today, with player handicaps spanning minus one through 10, with 10 being highest handicap. H.L. Herbert, with W.A. Hazard as his dedicated assistant, continued to guide the Association until 1921. Hazard then followed as USPA Chairman until 1922. The first USPA headquarters was appropriately located in New York, the center of polo at that time. The Association began operations on a voluntary basis of committee structure and continues as such today with a small office staff. Elected Officers and Governors serve annually along with appointed Committee Members. USPA membership originally included seven clubs and, the following year, 142 players registered and there were five new clubs. In its early days of organization, the Association initiated changes in the number and length of time periods (chukkers) in a match. Equipment became standardized and pony training improved significantly. Scoring was also adjusted to allow for fractioning of points for penalties‚Äîlater abolished as an unnecessarily complex method of scoring that was replaced with free shots. Even before the Association was formed, the Westchester Cup, one of the oldest tournaments in the world, was contested in 1886 by the United States and Britain. This prestigious international polo tournament was played at the time when the Kentucky Derby, Wimbledon and the British Open were all new events in a sparse sporting calendar. Though the British won that first match at Westchester easily, the Americans would use the defeat as a catalyst to improve their game strategy and the quality of their horses. The Association continued the series and the United States won nine of the next eleven matches including the 1939 competition, when the tournament was played for the last time at Meadowbrook before a crowd of 40,000. The Cup was not played again until 1988, when the United States defeated an Australasian team in Lexington, Kentucky. The U.S. won again against England in 1992 and later lost to the British in 1997. In 1904 another important tournament evolved, the United States Open. The first Open was won by the Wanderers, who scored 4-1/2 to the Freebooters 3. The tournament resumed in 1910 and continued every year with the exception of 1911, 1915, 1917, 1918, and 1942-1945. The U.S. Open Polo Championship¬Æ would become polo's most prestigious tournament still played annually and most recently at the International Polo Club ‚Äì West Palm Beach, Florida. The excitement of the sport was contagious; many of the early polo matches in the 1920s and 1930s attracted as many as 20,000 spectators. This would be an impressive attendance even by today's standards, yet when one considers the communication and transportation capabilities of that era it was truly incredible. The center of much of this excitement was Meadowbrook Polo Club in Westbury, NY, the site of many of the first U.S. Open and Westchester Cup Championships. During the 1913-14 season, the Westchester Cup packed 20,000 spectators into the stands. Even as polo gained in popularity across the country, eventually extending west to Texas, California and Hawaii, Meadowbrook would dominate the sport and be the center of polo during the first half of the century. During these early years of the USPA, one of the more famous players in polo was Foxhall Keene, handicapped for 14 years at 10 goals, and then 16 years at 9 goals. Though there were many other greats, four players stood out in the 1890s and early 1920s. They were: Harry Payne Whitney, the Waterbury brothers, Larry, Monty and Devereux Milburn. These four players were known as the original ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù and won the Westchester Cup in 1909, 1911, and 1913. Milburn would go on to play in seven international matches and established a reputation as one of the most outstanding players of all time. Credited with creating and leading the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù, Harry Payne Whitney played a pivotal role in the sport by helping develop a more fluid open form of play integrating better teamwork. By 1913, Circuit Cup play began with the first USPA Inter-circuit Cup held in 1916. The USPA claimed 1,407 members and began registration of the ponies as well though pony registration would later be dropped in the 1920s. College polo came of age and indoor polo grew in popularity championed by George Sherman and Robert A. Graviss. Contributing to the growth of polo during this period was the U.S. Army, who after joining the USPA in 1902, encouraged their members to participate in polo to improve their riding ability. From that time until World War II, the military would play a significant role in growing and sustaining the sport of polo by adding significant numbers of players and polo ponies. Polo's greatest era began in the years between the first and second World Wars. The sport not only survived the Great Depression, but expanded into the 1930s with increased international competition. The number of registered clubs had increased to 88 and playing membership was 2,889, of which 1,276 were military players. Louis Stoddard, a ten-goal player and member of two Westchester Cup Championship teams served as Chairman from 1922 to 1936. He would direct and expand the USPA during the period of great change. Other great names in polo emerged, such as ten-goaler Tommy Hitchcock, Jr., who reigned for 20 years and captured America's hearts. Both of Hitchcock's parents were strong supporters of polo; his mother taught young children the game and coached many polo players to greatness. Thomas Hitchcock, Sr. was also an outstanding player who was rated at ten goals in 1891. By 1928, another international match, The Cup of the Americas, was initiated between highly rated teams from the U.S. and Argentina. The U.S. Team won the first two competitions; however, from 1936, Argentina would go on to be the victor in future matches. The 1930s also saw women creating an impact on the sport, though they would not become official USPA members for years to come. During polo's heyday it was only fitting that Hollywood would become involved with this great sport. With a wonderful climate for the game and the appeal for movie stars and moguls, California polo expanded. The geographic spread of polo led to the first East-West match up in 1933, with the West winning two of three matches, proving the Westerners were a force with which to be reckoned. Humorist Will Rogers, a talented player and supporter of polo was thrilled. He is still remembered today as saying, ‚ÄúThe hillbillies beat the dudes and took the polo championship right out of the drawing room and into the bunkhouse‚Äù. The Great Depression eventually took its toll on the fabric of American society and polo, like most things, faced some dire times. As World War II began, the number of civilian players dropped from 1600 to 750. Though the number of military players peaked in 1940 with 1,432 registered members, Army polo would later disappear as the mechanization of the era outmoded the need for the cavalry. From 1942-1945 USPA tournaments were not played, though polo continued on private fields. Chairman, R.E. Strawbridge, Jr., headed the Association from 1936-1940, followed by Elbridge T. Gerry to 1946 and then Strawbridge served again from 1946-1950. Polo survived after the war, thanks in great part to Cecil Smith of Plano, Texas, considered one of the first ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù or paid players. By 1950, the number of active clubs was 56 with 614 USPA playing members. Devereux Milburn, Jr., son of the great 10-goal star, served as Chairman of the Association from 1950 to 1960. The early 1950s also marked the closing of Meadowbrook to make way for a highway; Meadowbrook relocated to Jericho, Long Island. The club would never regain its earlier dominance. A new star was on the horizon‚ÄîOak Brook in Chicago, Illinois. When the first U.S. Open was played there in the 1950s, the ascent of Oak Brook began and continued as American interest in polo revived during the 1960s. USPA clubs increased to 77 and 675 players were registered. The Indoor Polo Association combined with the USPA in 1954. Indoor polo, also known as arena polo - expanded the scope of the sport and intercollegiate polo made a comeback with George C. Sherman, Jr. serving as USPA Chairman from 1960 to 1966. In 1967 the USPA moved its headquarters from New York to Oak Brook, the new home of American polo. This era also marked the introduction of sponsor money for horses and professional players. With the help of William T. Ylvisaker, the Polo Training Foundation was established in 1967 for the purpose of raising donations for the purposes of teaching polo fundamentals and improving the sport. In 1970 the Association listed 100 clubs and 917 registered players. Northrup R. Knox would head the USPA from 1966 to 1970, followed by William Ylvisaker 1970-1975 and Hugo Dalmar, Jr. 1975-1976. The early 1970s brought about increased popularity in polo's major tournaments and in the club ranks. Polo flourished in Florida, encouraged by John T. Oxley's interest in high-goal polo and William T. Ylvisaker's promotion of the sport by courting corporate sponsorship. International play increased as the Camacho Cup, played at Juarez, Mexico, was revived. Norman Brinker closed out the decade as USPA Chairman from 1976 to 1980. Polo evolved from a society sport to include a far broader base of budget-minded horsemen, professional players and commercial sponsorship. With William Sinclaire as Chairman in 1980, the USPA registered 134 clubs and almost 1,400 players. Sinclaire was followed by S.K. Johnston, Jr. as Chairman from 1984 to 1988 who oversaw the move of the USPA offices to Lexington, KY. With the dominance of Oak Brook fading, the polo centers of the 1980s grew to include Florida, Texas and California. In 1986 the United States Polo Association moved its national headquarters to a more central location in the heart of thoroughbred country, Lexington, KY. Pride and spectator interest were at a high point, particularly after the 1989 Federation of International Polo World Championship in West Berlin, Germany. Eight teams from all over the world battled with the U.S. team riding away as the victor over Britain in the final match. Led by Chairman, John C. Oxley (1988-1991) prior to and during the Centennial year of the United States Polo Association, one looked back fondly at the memories and heritage of yesteryear and forward with anticipation to another glorious 100 years. Since that time, Chairmen Stephen A. Orthwein (1991-1995), Richard C. Riemenschneider (1995-1999), Orrin H. Ingram (1999-2003), Jack Shelton(2003-2007), Thomas Biddle, Sr. (2007-2011) and Charles Weaver (2011- 2015) have made great strides in the areas of umpiring, safety, rules, rules interpretation, development of international rules, and refinement of the handicapping process. The USPA national headquarters moved from Lexington KY. and are currently located In Lake Worth, FL. The USPA completed two major strategic planning efforts (2005 and 2011) that resulted in many new and innovative programs and services that were designed to grow and sustain the sport. The establishment of a professional leadership staff was a main objective of the strategic planning sessions. Polo continues to grow stronger, with current membership exceeding 4,500 members, many of whom are women players. Over two hundred fifty clubs and intercollegiate and interscholastic schools are registered with the USPA. Continued growth at the collegiate level assures a bright future as polo's strength depends on these young players of tomorrow.

It is most closely related to the brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor), with which it forms the genus Salanoia. The two are genetically similar, but morphologically distinct, leading scientists to recognize them as separate species. After an individual was observed in 2004, the animal became known to science and S. durrelli was described as a new species in 2010. It is found only in the Lac Alaotra area. A small, reddish-brown carnivore, Salanoia durrelli is characterized by broad feet with prominent pads, reddish-buff underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was . It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S. durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species. Taxonomy An individual Salanoia durrelli was observed swimming in 2004 by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) during a survey of bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur) in the Lac Alaotra area, the largest wetlands of Madagascar. The animal was captured, photographed, and then released, but examination of the photograph showed that it could not be identified with any known species of Malagasy carnivoran (family Eupleridae). Therefore, two specimens were caught in 2005 by the DWCT. One was killed to facilitate additional morphological comparisons.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 342 In 2010, it was formally described as Salanoia durrelli in a paper by conservationist Joanna Durbin and a team of scientists from the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance, Nature Heritage, the Natural History Museum, Conservation International, and the DWCT.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 341 The specific name, durrelli, honors Gerald Durrell, a noted conservationist and the founder of the DWCT.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 346 Previously, local villagers had already reported the presence of a small carnivoran at Alaotra, and it was speculated that the animal was the closely related brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor).Garbutt, 1999, p. 140 Salanoia durrelli was placed in the genus Salanoia, which previously included only the brown-tailed mongoose of eastern Madagascar. S. durrelli shows substantial morphological differences from the brown-tailed mongoose, but the mitochondrial DNA of the two species is very similar.Durbin et al., 2010, pp. 345‚Äì346 The discoverers chose to recognize the Lac Alaotra population as a separate species in view of its significant morphological differentiation. The observed morphological distinctiveness might be result of adaptations to life in the Alaotra wetlands, similar to the Alaotra bamboo lemur species, Hapalemur alaotrensis, which is also recognized as a distinct species despite being genetically close to the more widespread Hapalemur griseus.Durbin et al., 2010, pp. 351‚Äì352 Description Salanoia durrelli most closely resembles the brown-tailed mongoose, which is a small, gracile mongoose-like carnivoran.Garbutt, 2007, p. 219 It is reddish-brown overall, paler than the brown-tailed mongoose.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 348 The head and nape are speckled. The underparts are reddish-buff, not brownish as in the brown-tailed mongoose. Most of the tail is similar in color to the body, but the tip is yellowish-brown. The inner side of the well-furred external ear (pinna) is reddish-buff. The broad feet are naked below, with the naked skin buff on the forefeet and dark brown on the hindfeet, and show prominent pads. Each of the five digits on the fore- and hindfeet bears a long, dark brown claw. There are rows of stiff hairs along the outer margins of the feet. In contrast, the brown-tailed mongoose has narrower feet with more poorly developed pads. In S. durrelli, the fur is long and soft. The brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor), the closest relative of S. durrelli (the tail in this plate is incomplete)Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire, 1839; cf. Garbutt, 2007, pp. 219‚Äì220 In the holotype specimen, a female, the head and body length was , the tail length was , the hindfoot length was , the ear length was , and the body mass was . In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, the head and body length was about , the tail length was about , and the body mass was . Based on these limited data, S. durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose. The skull generally resembles that of the brown-tailed mongoose, but the rostrum (front part) is broad and deep, the nasal bones are broad and short, and the region of the palate is broad. The mandible (lower jaw) is robust and shows a high, steeply rising coronoid process (a projection at the back of the bone). Statistical analysis of measurements of the skulls and teeth strongly separates S. durrelli from specimens of the brown-tailed mongoose.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 344 Salanoia durrelli has a more robust dentition than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper incisors are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced diastema (gap) from the canine tooth.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 347 The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper premolar is small, but the second and third are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 349 The fourth premolar is large, as is the first molar. The second upper molar is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar. The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose. Distribution, habitat, and behavior Salanoia durrelli has been recorded at Andreba, a marshy area at above sea level on the eastern coast of Lac Alaotra. The nearest occurrence of the brown-tailed mongoose is about from Alaotra. The first observed specimen was swimming; it may have fled from human activity on the shore. The two others were caught on mats of floating vegetation. Thus, S. durrelli occurs in a marsh habitat‚Äîquite different from the forest-dwelling brown-tailed mongoose. S. durrelli may use its robust dentition to feed on prey with hard parts, such as crustaceans and molluscs, in addition to small vertebrates, rather than insects, which the more gracile-toothed brown-tailed mongoose eats. Indeed, the two specimens of S. durrelli were captured using traps baited with fish and meat. S. durrelli is similar in many respects to the larger mainland African marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosa), a carnivorous wetland-dweller that also uses mats of vegetation to eat and sleep on.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 350 Conservation status The unique habitat of Lac Alaotra is threatened by pollution, destruction of marshes for the construction of rice fields, overfishing, and introduced species such as exotic fish, plants, the black rat (Rattus rattus), and the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), another small carnivoran. A bird restricted to the area, the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus), was declared extinct in 2010BirdLife International, 2010 and the population of the bamboo lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999.Mutschler et al., 2001 As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, S. durrelli is likely to be threatened by degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition with the small Indian civet and the black rat, but its conservation status has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a protected area.Durbin et al., 2010, p. 352 References Literature cited *BirdLife International. 2010.

It is a light-colored, medium to large-sized subspecies with a narrow, flattened frontal bone.Glover, A. (1942), Extinct and vanishing mammals of the western hemisphere, with the marine species of all the oceans, American Committee for International Wild Life Protection, pp. 205-206. The subspecies was initially listed as Endangered on March 9, 1978, but had the classification removed in the year 2000 due to the effects of the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. On August 6, 2010, the northern Rocky Mountain wolf was ordered to be returned under Endangered Species Act protections by U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in a decision overturning a previous ruling by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They were later removed on August 31, 2012 from the list because of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming meeting the population quotas for the species to be considered stable. This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). Physiology =Description= This subspecies generally weighs and stands at 26‚Äì32 inches, making it one of the largest subspecies of the gray wolf. It is a lighter- colored animal that inhabits the Rocky Mountains with a coat including far more white and less black. In general, the subspecies favors lighter colors, with black mixing in among them. Its population currently resides in western Montana, eastern Idaho, western Wyoming and southern Alberta.https://thewolfintelligencer.com/northern-rocky-mountain-wolf-canis- lupus-irremotus = Dietary habits = Two wolf subspecies that live in the northern Rocky Mountains: Canis lupus irremotus (left) and Canis lupus occidentalis (right) The northern Rocky Mountain wolf preys primarily on the bison, elk, the Rocky Mountain mule deer, and the beaver, though it is an opportunistic animal and will prey upon other species if the chance arises. But, for the most part, small prey animals do not make up a large part of its diet. When an individual or a pack is able to take down numerous prey, the amount a northern Rocky Mountain wolf eats daily will generally make up about 10‚Äì21% of its body mass, though there have been recorded instances of an individual eating up to 37% of its body mass. However, when prey is not as plentiful, northern Rocky Mountain wolves are able to survive for considerably long periods of time while eating only small amounts. Cannibalism, in times of severe food shortage, occurs, as a pack will kill and eat an injured or weak member of the group.  History  Early recorded history of the northern Rocky Mountain wolf found it roaming primarily in the forests that would later become known as Yellowstone National Park. They resided nearby Native Americans of the Tukudika tribe, who considered the wolf to be a sacred animal. As the American population began spreading west in the late 19th century, ranchers, farmers, and cattle drivers began to settle in the area. In due time, the northern Rocky Mountain wolf began preying on the livestock brought by the settlers. A practice of eradication was enacted in 1915, through the use of guns, traps, and poison. This policy was made even more all encompassing by the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, which regulated control over the land in Yellowstone and authorized through the National Park Service Organic Act the \\"destruction of such animals and such plant life that may be detrimental\\". By 1924, the last known wolves in the bounds of Yellowstone were killed, though small numbers of the northern Rocky Mountain wolf survived in outlying areas. =Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan= The Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan was first approved in 1980, though it was then revised later on in 1987. The plan required a certain population of northern Rocky Mountain wolves to reside in the area inside and around Yellowstone, which included at least ten breeding pairs, and for the population to remain stable for at least three consecutive years. However, the northern Rocky Mountain wolf was not, at the time of the initial drafting, recognized as a legitimate subspecies, so the wolves involved in the plan were instead the Mackenzie Valley wolf. The overall reason for this was that the stated two subspecies of wolf roamed in the same general area as the northern Rocky Mountain wolf and because the plan covered the reintroduction of wolves into the area in general. For this reason, the more plentiful subspecies were chosen to be trans-located, so as to not upset the balance in the areas they would be taken from. In response to concerns about wolves being allowed to run free in the area, killing livestock without any allowed repercussions, the final draft of the plan, completed on November 22, 1994, outlined that ranchers were allowed to kill wolves if they were \\"caught in the act of killing livestock on private property\\". In three lawsuits combined as Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation v. Babbitt, opponents of reintroduction argued that the reintroduced wolves threatened wolves that might already inhabit the area, while supporters argued against the experimental designation and for fully protected status. District Court Judge William F. Downes ruled that the re-introduction violated section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act; however, this ruling was overturned by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. =Policy changes for the ESA= In 2007, a memorandum was drafted by the solicitor for the United States Department of the Interior, which looked at the wording of the Endangered Species Act. Specifically, the paper considered the meaning of the phrase \\"significant portion of its range\\". The memorandum detailed that the previous range of a species under the ESA was unimportant and that the current range of such a species was what was important, not what it \\"historically occupied\\". A number of environmental groups were outraged over the memorandum, as the density of species under their current range would end up with many taken off the Endangered Species List, even if the population was far lower than what would be considered stable. Jeremy Bruskotter, who is an environmental scientist, authored two papers in early 2009 stating that, if the memorandum is taken seriously, it could result in \\"an increased risk of extinction for some species.\\" On the other hand, Robin Waples, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center, stated that \\"the memorandum by itself does not reduce protections\\". Since the memorandum was drafted, five rulings that relied heavily upon it were passed regarding endangered species, one of which was about the population of the northern Rocky Mountain wolf. The ruling decided that protection for the species was to be \\"sharply limited\\". However, in 2009, wildlife groups challenged the ruling. On January 21, 2009, President Barack Obama made a presidential ruling for all federal agencies to \\"halt all pending regulations until his administration can review them.\\" This, in turn, has halted the delisting of many species under the ESA, though the northern Rocky Mountain wolf had already been removed prior to this regulation. U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy ruled in an appealed decision on August 6, 2010, that the northern Rocky Mountain wolf must either be \\"listed as an endangered species or removed from the list, but the protections for the same population can't be different for each state.\\" This ruling came about from the challenged decision in 2009 by wildlife groups and would end many of the special regulations that individual states had held over the species. The Fish and Wildlife Service made a statement that endangered protections would remain for the entire species until Wyoming is able to bring the population of wolves within its borders into required standards. The populations for Idaho and Montana have already exceeded the requirements and, thus, previously had had no protections for the wolves in the states. On August 31, 2012, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it would be removing endangered species protections from the northern Rocky Mountain wolf, as Wyoming has achieved the necessary populations to qualify with 328 wolves. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe called the renewal of the wolf subspecies to be a \\"major success story\\". Wyoming has also instituted its own \\"dual status\\" system that would protect the wolves inside Yellowstone park, but allow any wolves who leave the area to be shot on sight. Currently, 224 of the 328 wolves in Wyoming live outside of Yellowstone Park. In September, 2014, the US District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the delisting of the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf, which then reverted to its former status as a nonessential experimental population in all of Wyoming.http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/wolf/ References External links * \\"Feds renewing efforts to delist wolves?\\" ‚Äì Idaho Mountain Express * \\"Are northern Rockies wolves on the decline?\\" ‚Äì Idaho Mountain Express * \\"Utah split on wolf protection status\\" ‚Äì Standard Examiner * Gray Wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountains U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Rocky Mountains Wolf, Northern Rocky Mountains Wolf, Northern Rocky Mountains Wolf, Northern Rocky Mountains Category:Wolves in the United States Wolf Category:Environmental issues in the United States Category:Subspecies of Canis lupus Category:Mammals described in 1937 fr:Canis lupus irremotus ","title":"Northern Rocky Mountain wolf"},{"id":"28236548","title":"Neuch√¢tel Open"},{"id":"28236551","text":"A pecan is a type of nut belonging to either of two species: * Carya illinoinensis, the usual meaning of pecan * Carya aquatica, bitter pecan, also called water hickory The pecans are the four species of section Apocarya in the genus Carya, two of which are individually known as hickories Pecan may also refer to: Places ;In the United States * Pecan, Georgia * Pecan City, Georgia * Pecan Acres, Texas * Pecan Bayou (disambiguation) * Pecan Gap, Texas * Pecan Grove (disambiguation) * Pecan Hill, Texas * Pecan Park, Houston, a neighbourhood of Houston, Texas * Pecan Plantation, Texas * Pecan Valley, Texas Foods *Pecan pie *Pecan sandie Sports * Pecan Bowl, a defunct college football game ","title":"Pecan (disambiguation)"},{"id":"28236552","text":"Lala Abdul Rashid or Abdul Rashid (1 June 1922 - 8 March 1988) was a member of Pakistan's gold medal winning 1960 Olympic field hockey team.

Hall, who is known as a skeptic in the medical community, has written that, while it is well-accepted that it is more healthy to eat a plant-based diet than a typical Western diet, Greger often overstates the known benefits of such a diet as well as the harm caused by eating animal products (for example, in a talk, he claimed that a single meal rich in animal products can \\"cripple\\" one's arteries), and he sometimes does not discuss evidence that contradicts his strong claims. A review of Greger's How Not to Die, published on Healthline, while praising some aspects of the book, also criticized \\"its repeated misrepresentation of research to fit the plant-based ideology.\\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-not-to-die-review \\"'How Not to Die' by Dr. Michael Greger: A Critical Review\\", Denise Minger, May 21, 2017, Healthline Publications * Heart Failure: Diary of a Third-Year Medical Student (2000) * Carbophobia: The Scary Truth Behind America's Low Carb Craze (2005). * Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching (2007) * How Not To Die: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease (Hardcover) (2015) (with Gene Stone) *The How Not to Die Cookbook: 100+ Recipes to Help Prevent and Reverse Disease (with Gene Stone & Robin Robertson) (Hardcover) (2018) *How Not to Diet: The Groundbreaking Science of Healthy, Permanent Weight Loss (Hardcover) (2019) *How to Survive a Pandemic (Paperback) (2020) References  External links  * * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American physicians Category:American food writers Category:American founders Category:American nutritionists Category:American people of Jewish descent Category:American primary care physicians Category:Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences alumni Category:Diet food advocates Category:Plant-based diet advocates Category:Tufts University School of Medicine alumni Category:Veganism activists ","title":"Michael Greger"},{"id":"28236585","text":"George G.

The church is located in Muscatine, Iowa, United States. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 2006 it was included as a contributing property in the Downtown Commercial Historic District. History =Development of the Episcopal Church in Muscatine= The original Trinity Church in Muscatine. The Episcopal Church in Muscatine can trace its roots to the arrival of Matthew Matthews, his son Dorrance, and his brothers Hiram and Joseph, and their families in 1839 when the town was named Bloomington. They were visited by the Rt. Rev. Jackson Kemper, Missionary Bishop of the Northwest, the same year and the congregation was organized. It is the first Episcopal parish organized in Iowa. with The next year when Bishop Kemper visited he reports the church had seven communicants and timber for the construction of a church building. The bishop contributed $100 towards its construction. The church was a frame building that measured , and was one and three-fourths stories high. It had eight windows, fifteen lights, and a small vestry room. When Trinity was not using the building the Presbyterian Congregation held services in the building. A bell was mounted on the vestry room and it was utilized by both congregations. The Freemasons completed a second story on the building and occupied that part of the building. Bishop Kemper was opposed to the Masons presence in the building and refused to consecrate the church. This was the first church of any denomination built in Muscatine County, and the first Episcopal Church in Iowa. The church had no rector initially and was visited by the Rev. Zachariah Goldsmith from Trinity Church in Davenport. On June 28, 1842, the church was reorganized at a meeting with fourteen people present. The Rev. Samuel Sherwell, a deacon from New York, was placed in charge of the church on May 12, 1843. =Present church= Fa√ßade The Rev. John B. Calhoun, who came to Trinity in 1850, asked parishioners to subscribe towards a new church building. In the spring of 1851, sixteen members subscribed $1,250. He was sent east to collect more subscriptions and he collected a further $1,298.50 from one hundred and sixty- eight people. Frank Will, an architect from New York City, was chosen to design the new church. The new church was built on the same lot as the old church. The basement and foundations were built in the fall of 1851 and the cornerstone was laid on November 11. Construction on the church took three years. It is built of sandstone in the Gothic Revival style. Bishop Kemper came to Muscatine to consecrate the new church on May 25, 1854. He was assisted by the Rev. John Ufford. The building was enlarged in 1855, and it was given its cruciform plan at that time. A bell was placed in the bell-cote in 1856. The present interior oak furnishings, including an altar, pulpit, lectern, choir stalls, and pews, were installed in 1887 when the Reverend E.C. Paget was the rector. The stained glass windows in the transepts were added at the same time. The Ascension window at the end of the nave was installed in 1896. =Diocese of Iowa= Plaque on the church The Diocese of Iowa was organized by Bishop Kemper in 1853. He invited the clergy and representatives of the various congregations of the state to a meeting at Trinity Church in Muscatine on August 17. In the absence of the bishop the Rev. Alfred Louderbeck of Trinity Church in Davenport was elected the chairman. At this gathering, the constitutions and canons for the new diocese were adopted, and plans were made for the election of a bishop. On October 18, 1854, Rev. Henry Washington Lee, rector of St. Luke's Church in Rochester, New York was elected bishop at Trinity Church in Davenport. The Diocese of Iowa began participating in Education in Ministry in 1989. It is a theological extension program of the School of Theology of the University of the South. Trinity and St. Paul's Indian Mission in Sioux City were the original centers for the people of Iowa to gather for the program. =Storm damage= Lightning struck the church during an early morning thunderstorm on August 9, 2010. Significant damage was done to the bell-cote on the front of the church and an iron cross on top.

They were also the sites of race riots in which working-class whites destroyed multiple black homes in 1824 and 1831, respectively. Hard Scrabble Hard Scrabble was a predominantly black neighborhood in northwestern Providence in the early 19th century. Away from the town center, its inexpensive rents attracted working class free blacks, poor people of all races and marginalized businesses such as saloons and houses of prostitution. Tensions developed between the residents of Hard Scrabble and other residents of Providence. Hard Scrabble was one of several similar neighborhoods in urban centers in the Northeast where free blacks gathered to further themselves socially and economically. Other African American communities created in cities with growing job markets in the same time period include the northern slope of Boston‚Äôs Beacon Hill, Little Liberia in Bridgeport, Connecticut and Sandy Ground on New York‚Äôs Staten Island. On October 18, 1824, a white mob attacked black homes in Hard Scrabble, after a black man refused to get off the sidewalk when approached by some whites. Although the mob claimed to be targeting places of ill-repute, it destroyed buildings indiscriminately. Hundreds of whites destroyed approximately 20 black homes. Four people were tried for rioting, but only one was found guilty. Snow Town After the Hard Scrabble riot, the Snow Town neighborhood rose in roughly the same area. It was another interracial neighborhood where free blacks and poor whites lived among crime and marginal businesses. In 1831 more riots took place in Snow Town, one triggered by the shooting death of a sailor. Once again, the mob destroyed many homes, targeting black homes even though the people living in them had no apparent ties to the shooting, spilling over into nearby Olney Street. This time, the militia was called out, and it killed four white rioters. Political fallout The Hardscrabble Riot had engendered little media sympathy for its victims. But by the time of the Snow Town riot, leading citizens and journalists took the problem far more seriously.Crouch, \\"Providence Newspapers and the Racist Riots of 1824 and 1831\\" http://patriot.net/~crouch/artj/riot.html After the Snow Town riot, written opinion approved of suppressing rioters to maintain order, and Providence voters approved a charter for a city government containing strong police powers. Location and memorialization The exact location of the Hard Scrabble and Snow Town neighborhoods within northwestern Providence has been a matter of some dispute, which complicated efforts to memorialize Hard Scrabble. Richard Lobban, professor at Rhode Island College and the Naval War College, believed the riot took place on what is now the State House lawn while Ted Sanderson, executive director of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission said his research showed that the Hard Scrabble neighborhood was located around the base of Olney Street. In 2006, a memorial plaque was installed in a grass-covered traffic island at the corner of North Main and Canal Streets near the State House. A memorial for the Snow Town riot is located nearby at the Roger Williams National Memorial.

The GGMC is a group of 50 ethnically and socially diverse gay and gay-supportive men, and is dedicated to giving voice to the gay community through song. The GGMC presents spring, summer, and winter programs annually, in addition to numerous guest and community benefit performances throughout the year.  History  =Early years= In August, 1982, GGMC founder Dick Kramer put out word (and posters) that he was forming a new group, to be called the Dick Kramer Gay Men's Chorale. He envisioned a small men's ensemble of around 40, reminiscent of university men's choruses of 19th century Europe. The new chorale rehearsed at Dick's home for its first couple years, before finding a home, first at St. Francis Lutheran Church in San Francisco, and in 1996 at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, where it now rehearses and performs. The chorale performed three sets annually, with each set consisting of 3-4 performances in San Francisco, San Mateo, Marin, Alameda and/or Contra Costa counties. The chorale also did regular joint performances with the Temescal GMC (Oakland), Liedermann Chorus (now Silicon Valley GMC), Contra Costa Chorale, VOICES Lesbian Chorus, Lesbian/Gay Chorus of San Francisco, and San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, as well as participating in the annual Pride Concert. The DKGMC was also a founding member of the new organization, GALA Choruses (Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses), in 1983 (and has been represented in every GALA festival to date). From its first performances in 1982, the DKGMC was well received by the local press and San Francisco audiences, and received favorable reviews for its programming and performances. In addition, the DKGMC was featured regularly at the Cable Car Awards, both as performer and award recipient, and sang for the opening of Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood. =Early performances= Major performances of the period include: full-scale production of Benjamin Britten's \\"The Burning Fiery Furnace\\" (1984), Giuseppe Verdi \\"Requiem (Verdi)\\" (1985, with the Contra Costa Chorale), Carl Orff \\"Carmina Burana (Orff)\\" (1986, with Contra Costa Chorale). The Britten performance was rebroadcast nationally, as well as in Europe and Australia. The DKGMC was among 17 choruses at the second GALA Choruses festival in Minneapolis in 1986, and shared the stage with the Denver Women's Chorus in a special joint performance of Schubert's \\"Mass in G,\\" the first large mixed choral performance at a GALA festival. After almost six years as music director, in April 1988, Dick Kramer conducted his farewell concert of Kurt Weill's \\"Berliner Requiem.\\"  The Golden Gate Men's Chorus  The DKGMC was reorganized as the Golden Gate Men's Chorus, in 1988. After several interim directors, William Garcia Ganz was appointed in 1991. During his four-year tenure, the GGMC produced three full concerts of all-American composers, as well as two concerts in conjunction with the Society of Gay and Lesbian Composers of new works by local lesbian and gay composers. The GGMC also performed joint reciprocal holiday concerts with the Sacramento Gay Men's Chorus in San Francisco and Sacramento (1990,1991) and with Slavyanka Russian Chorus in San Francisco and Santa Clara (1994, 1995). In 1996, Joseph Jennings (then Artistic Director of Chanticleer (ensemble) was appointed as music director. During his 13-year tenure, the GGMC achieved a high level of artistic quality, attracted a steady flow of musicians as new members, and expanded its audience and donor base. =Recordings and Performances= The GGMC has released five recorded albums, Loving Again (2000), recorded at Skywalker Ranch in Marin; MASS (2003), Tidings of Comfort and Joy (2006), 30 (2012), and Out of the Deep (2016) all recorded at Saint Ignatius Church (San Francisco). Since 1999, the GGMC has been supported by annual grants from the San Francisco Grants for the Arts. Included among its regular season performances, the GGMC has produced two major staged productions of cabaret music \\"Love Changes Everything\\" (1997,1998), a three-month tour of San Francisco historic sites \\"Now We Sing the City\\" (including SF City Hall) (1999), a joint performance to a full house at Grace Cathedral, San Francisco with the London Gay Men's Chorus and Le Choeur Int'l Gai de Paris (2000), eight major orchestral sacred concerts, and hosted the Harvard Glee Club in its first joint performance with a gay men's chorus (2004). =Collaborations and Commissions= In May 2010, the Golden Gate Men's Chorus announced the appointment of Joseph Piazza as music director. Under his leadership, the GGMC celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2012 with the recording \\"30\\"; has presented collaborative performances with the Peninsula Women's Chorus, Singers Marin, the Lesbian/Gay Chorus of San Francisco, the San Francisco Choral Society, the Piedmont East Bay Children's Choir, the San Francisco Girls Chorus, the San Francisco Boys Chorus, and Na Lei Hulu I Ka Wekiu; and has premiered commissions by David Conte, Steven Sametz, David Del Tredici, Eric Whitacre, William Hawley, Josu Elberdin, Vytautas Mi≈°kinis, Leonard Enns, Ivo Antognini, Kirby Shaw, Anders Paulsson, Philip Lawson, ƒíriks E≈°envalds, Stephen Main, and Fredrik Sixten.

The route is named after the Boeing 747. Schedule 747 bus terminus at Montreal-Trudeau The service operates year-round, 24 hours a day, the only STM bus route to do so. When service first started buses ran every 30 minutes during off-peak hours and at 20-minute intervals during the afternoon rush hour, but due to increasing demand buses, in 2010 the frequency of services was increased to every 10‚Äì12 minutes from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m, every 30 minutes from 5:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., and every hour from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. Subsequently, afternoon and evening service frequencies have improved further.

It is the predecessor of the Yamaha FZ6. During its production run, it underwent several changes before being discontinued in 2004 due to European emissions laws coming into force. The FZS600 was first unveiled at the Paris Auto Show in 1997, and shares parts from other Yamaha models, notably the engine from the YZF600R Thundercat, detuned to give more mid-range power, and the front discs and blue-dot calipers from the YZF-R1. Revisions for the 2002 model saw a newer more modern styled fairing similar to the FZS1000 Fazer. This used a newer and better headlight design, an often mentioned criticism of the launch bike. The Fazer is a well reviewed motorcycle that is generally considered reliable although many owners have reported problems caused by a weak front sprocket nut.

Minnesota was considered a swing state in the election. Both major-party candidates made high-profile visits to the state. Obama gave a speech declaring victory in the Democratic primaries in June of that year at the Xcel Energy Center. The venue was used three months later to host the 2008 Republican National Convention in September where McCain accepted the nomination of the Republican Party. Obama went on to win the state in the November election, earning all ten of its electoral votes. =United States Senate= Incumbent Republican Senator Norm Coleman was challenged by radio host and comedian DFLer Al Franken and former Independence Senator Dean Barkley. The race was close, requiring a recount followed by several legal challenges that would prevent a winner from being seated until July 2009. While Coleman held a slight lead at the end of election night, the subsequent recount ultimately gave Al Franken a 225-vote lead. A legal challenge by Coleman was unsuccessful and Franken was eventually certified as the winner of the election following a unanimous ruling of the Minnesota Supreme Court, having a final margin of 312 votes. =United States House of Representatives= All of Minnesota's eight seats in the United States House of Representatives were up for election in 2008.

Its congregation was founded in 1809 by free African Americans worshiping at Trinity Church, Wall Street as the Free African Church of St. Philip. First located in the notorious Five Points neighborhood, it is the oldest black Episcopal parish in New York City., pp. 242-43 Historically, it was extremely influential both while located in lower Manhattan and as an institution in Harlem, and many of its members have been leaders in the black community. History =Previous buildings= The first church foundation stone was laid in 1819, and the first rector, serving from 1826 to 1840, was the Rev. Peter Williams, Jr., a leading abolitionist and the first African-American Episcopal priest in New York. He was one of three blacks who served on the first executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society.[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgGhBwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA97&dq;=Downing+Meeting+House,+Chincoteague,+Va&source;=gbs_toc_r&cad;=3#v=onepage&q;=Downing%20Meeting%20House%2C%20Chincoteague%2C%20Va&f;=false Kyle T.

They stressed education and promoted \\"character, respectability, and uplift.\\"Balthius (2014), Four Steeples, p. 148 In the following decades Black Episcopalians continued to build on their church connections, with some creating a niche in marine trades, where white Episcopalians owned ships and served as captains. Some achieved professional status as teachers and doctors, and others had businesses as grocers and restaurateurs. The first two sites were located on 122 Centre Street. In 1822, a brick building replaced the original wood frame church, which had been damaged by fire. It was renovated twice because of damage suffered in social unrest. In 1834 the church was vandalized by whites. During the American Civil War, it suffered damage by New York City police using it as a barracks for militia and police during the 1863 New York City draft riots. Many ethnic Irish attacked blacks on the street and their institutions during this riot. Demographic changes continued as New York expanded and the city developed uptown. New waves of immigrants settled in the oldest housing, and more established residents moved north along the island. Along with its congregation, St. Philip's relocated uptown, by 1886 having a site on 25th Street.Church History, St. Philip's Harlem (Accessed 2 August 2010) It sold this property c.1909 for $600,000. With this money it bought the site of the current church, as well as 10 apartment buildings on West 135th Street in Harlem. This area had previously been restricted to whites only. Some moved beyond the city limits into the developing railroad suburbs. The reredos of the current church came from the church on 25th Street. Like many other churches, St. Philip's had considerable stability in its leadership through the mid-20th century. Rev. Hutchens C. Bishop was rector for 47 years, from 1886 until 1933. Bishop's son, Shelton Hale Bishop, served as rector from 1933-1957. =Current building= The present church building was designed by architects Vertner Woodson Tandy and George Washington Foster of the firm Tandy & Foster. Both were prominent African-American architects: Tandy was the first African-American architect licensed to practice in New York State and Foster was among the first licensed by the State of New Jersey. The church was built in 1910-1911 in the Neo-Gothic style. See also: The church was designated as a New York City Landmark in 1993, p.203 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Parishioners Notable parishioners of St. Philip's include, in the 19th century: Thomas Jennings, Thomas Downing, his son George T. Downing, Dr. James McCune Smith, and Alexander Crummell.Bulthius (2014), Four Steeples, p. 152 In the 20th century, such political and cultural leaders as professor and public intellectual W. E. B.

History  Ecologic Brands was founded in May 2008, when entrepreneur Julie Corbett saw an opportunity to create an eco-friendly bottle to replace the ubiquitous rigid plastic containers and laminated paperboard cartons her family and community consumed. Growing up in Montreal, Julie‚Äôs inspiration was the Canadian milk pouch, a clear light-weight pouch of milk that is placed in a re-usable plastic carafe. She set out to create her own version of the Canadian milk pouch ‚Äì a bottle that would minimize the use of plastic while maintaining functionality and convenience. The idea of a molded fiber shell came to Corbett when she opened the box her new iPhone came in, and the iPhone was nestled on a smooth, sturdy molded fiber tray. Corbett saw the opportunity to use molded fiber to shape a bottle, with a thin pouch inside. Pulling from her knowledge of pulp and paper, Corbett designed a bottle that combines a rigid outer pulp shell (made mainly from old corrugated cardboard boxes or ‚ÄúOCC‚Äù) with a thin inner plastic liner and re-sealable cap. She patented her technology and began to explore the market opportunity for her innovation. The bottle evolved into an eco-friendly replacement for milk, juice, laundry detergent, household cleaning products and other high volume liquid categories. Ecologic's commercial introduction came in January 2010 when the company partnered with Straus Family Creamery for its first market test at Whole Foods Market in Northern California. The Ecologic bottle was used to package Straus Family Creamery's Fat Free Milk and was featured next to Straus' other dairy products for 6 weeks.Greener Design, January 21, 2010 During that time, Straus‚Äô Fat Free milk experienced 72% lift with only one Ecologic shelf facing and Fat Free milk in the Ecologic bottle became the second best selling Straus SKU (stock-keeping unit). Ecologic's second customer, Seventh Generation, is a brand of non-toxic household and personal care products. Together they launched Seventh Generation Natural 4X Laundry Detergent on March 9, 2011. The Natural 4X Laundry Detergent is available on natural retailer shelves throughout the country. The company received press attention with this announcement, including a story in USA TODAY.USA Today, March 8, 2011  Products  The Ecologic bottle uses proprietary technology to combine a rigid molded pulp outer shell with a thin plastic inner liner and re-sealable cap. The molded fiber shell is made from 100% post-consumer recycled material and is 100% compostable or re-recyclable with paper.Ecologic Brands Our Containers page The inner liner is made of #2 or #4 BPA-free plastic and uses up to 70% less plastic than comparable plastic jugs.Packaging Digest , February 1, 2010 The Ecologic bottle can be customized to a brand's specifications.

Brutus' story Brutus was born in January 2002. He spent his first months in a six-foot square steel box that was his mother's cage at a captive bear facility. Grizzlies born in captivity are not released into the wild for two primary reasons: First, a captive-born cub lacks the education that would have been provided by its mother during its first two years in the wild; second, a bear born in captivity does not have the same wariness that makes wild bears avoid interactions with humans. Brutus lives at Montana Grizzly Encounter Rescue and Educational Sanctuary. The facility was founded by Casey Anderson as a place to raise Brutus and aid in the study of grizzlies. Brutus has appeared frequently on television with Casey Anderson, including regular appearances as Anderson's \\"co-host\\" on the Nat Geo/Nat Geo WILD series .

A total of 108 people were killed, and 38 others injured when within a short period of time several bombs exploded near four apartment buildings. Investigations found that Jin was motivated by hatred for his ex-wife, ex-mother-in-law and a lover; he had previously threatened to blow up their buildings. Sequence of events The explosives were made from ammonium nitrate. Jin had paid 950 RMB ($115) to Wang Yushun () and Hao Fengqin (), owners of an illegal explosives workshop near Shijiazhuang. According to Jin Ruchao's confession, he flew to Tianjin after stabbing his girlfriend to death in her Maguan County, Yunnan home and took a bus to the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, where he hid the fuse and detonators. He then purchased dynamites from Wang Yushun, who he also bought small quantities of dynamite from last year for experiments, in Luquan District. From March 12-14, Jin bought dynamite from Wang for 3 times. On the 15th, Jin rented a pick-up truck to transport his bombs to his targets, which were in bags labeled as \\"chicken feed\\". For some reason, the truck driver refused to take the bags further while midway through the journey and Jin was forced to store them in an abandoned building in a village outside of the city. At 8 pm that night, he first rented a three-wheeler to transport bombs to the Hardware Company dorm () on 13 Dianda Street and 12th Hutong on Minjin Street (), as well as the Shijiazhuang Number 1 Construction () and Number 3 Cotton Mill () dorms. After a quick nap, he delivered more bombs to the latter two dorms with the help of another three-wheeler and a taxi. He then took multiple taxis to detonate the bombs one by one. The first bomb went off at 4:16 am and blew a hole in the walls of the 15 Cotton Mill dorm, which housed Jin's step mother at the time. Shortly after, the 16 Cotton Mill dorm, where Jin lived and had a bitter argument with a neighbor regarding splitting rooms, was completely leveled by the second bomb. The third bomb when off at 4:30 am, destroying a unit of the Shijiazhuang Construction company dorm, which housed Jin's ex. At 4:45 am, a unit of the Hardware Company dorm, which housed Jin's ex, was demolished by a bomb. The final explosion came at 5:01 am, at the 12th Hutong on Minjin Street, which Jin had inherited from his parents but had lost money selling the property. Fortunately, the bomb had only made a crater on the ground nearby. Perpetrators Jin Ruchao (C: Èù≥Â¶ÇË∂Ö, P: J√¨n R√∫chƒÅo), (December 7, 1960 - April 29, 2001) was blamed and arrested for planning and carrying out the bombings. Jin became deaf at age 8 due to an ear infection, and he since became silent and a loner. He was also subjected to constant bullying at school. He dropped out during middle school due to financial issues and worked in a textile factory among a plethora of other jobs. He had kept a diary, where he wrote that he was suspicious towards his family members, particularly his ex-wife, on whom he blamed his rape conviction in 1988. Jin also blamed traffic accidents that killed his mother and injured his father in 1994 on his ex-wife and her family. Following widespread public fear, the Chinese Government published a lengthy description of the bombings. Jin was arrested in Beihai, Guangxi following a manhunt and a posted 100,000 RMB ($12,000) reward just 11 days after the bombing, which had been doubled from an initial 50,000 RMB. After pleading guilty, Jin was sentenced to death and executed, along with the three who supplied Jin with about 1,300 pounds of homemade explosives. Aftermath The attack was the biggest mass murder in China in decades. China scholar Andrew Scobell described it as perhaps the worst terrorist act in the history of the People's Republic of China.Martin I. Wayne, ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs war on terrorism: counter-insurgency, politics, and internal security,‚Äù (New York, NY: Routeledge, 2008). There were rumours that Jin was a scapegoat with no knowledge of explosives, and that the blast could have been orchestrated by disaffected ex-employees of who had been laid-off in China's restructuring. On 29 April 2001, Jin Ruchao, Wang Yushun, and Hao Fengqin received the death penalty for their roles in the bombings.

Most noted as one of the earliest members The Royal Ballet, she was regarded as a versatile dancer; dancing all the established 19th-century classical repertoire, and creating roles in new ballets by Ninette de Valois and Frederick Ashton. After retiring from professional ballet, she became a teacher at the Royal Ballet School, and also served as vice-president of the Royal Academy of Dance. Biography Pamela May was born Doris May, in the city of San Fernando, Trinidad, on 30 May 1917. Her parents were British, but had moved to the Caribbean for the purposes of her fathers work as an oil engineer. The family returned to London when May was 4 years old. May began studying ballet with Freda Grant. At the age of 16, she progressed to the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, where she studied under the direction of Ninette de Valois. A year later in 1934, she made her debut with the Vic-Wells Ballet and was later contracted as a salaried member of the company. It was also around this time that she adopted the professional name Pamela May, after de Valois announced in rehearsal, that a role she was to perform could not be danced by someone named Doris. Her new name was printed in the programme for the ballet without her knowledge. May performed as a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet until 1952. At that time she became a character dancer and continued performing with the company until she retired from the stage completely in 1982. After she retired as a principal dancer, de Valois invited May to become a teacher at the Royal Ballet School, a position which she held from 1954 until 1977.

The accident investigation concluded that the crew attempted an approach to land in visibility conditions worse than the approved minima for that airfield and aircraft, and failed to execute a missed approach procedure in a timely manner before the aircraft struck trees and terrain. Accident The aircraft crashed while on final approach for a landing at Igarka Airport,11 dead in a plane crash, RT, 2 August 2010 around short of the runway.Death toll in Russia's East Siberia passenger jet crash rises to 12 (Update-4), RIAN, 2 August 2010 Conditions at the time of the crash were reported to be raining, with light clouds and thunderstorms in the area. The crash occurred at around 01:40 local time (17:40 UTC, 2 August). A government agency, the Federal Air Transport Agency, said that \\"the plane veered to the right of its landing course and collided with the ground in front of the runway.\\" Aircraft An Antonov An-24 of Katekavia similar to the accident aircraft The aircraft involved was a twin-turboprop Antonov An-24RV with serial number 47310003 and Russian registration RA-46524. Built in 1974, at the time of the accident the airframe had logged almost 54,000 hours of flight. Casualties Ten of the passengers and one crew member on board the plane died in the crash,Airliner crashes in Russia's East Siberia; 11 dead, 4 survive (Update-3), RIAN, 2 August 2010 while three of the crew members and one passenger survived. The passenger later died at the hospital of sustained injuries on 3 August 2010, bringing the death toll to twelve. The other three survivors sustained only minor injuries. The three survivors were the pilot, the co-pilot, and the flight engineer. Originally, all on board were said to have died; subsequent reports said seven people died before a death toll of eleven and later twelve was established. Aftermath Soon after the crash, a fire at the site was extinguished, allowing for a search for the aircraft's black boxes. An investigation was also begun shortly after the incident. Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) were recovered, although the CVR contained only data from the first 80 minutes of the 90-minute flight. The FDR contained a complete record of the flight. As a result of the crash, a government investigation to the operating practices of Katekavia was begun. Investigation Final report by MAK into the crash of RA-46524 A preliminary investigation indicated that the crash occurred due to fog in the area, leading the plane to hit trees ahead of the runway. The final accident report by Moscow's Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) was released in October 2010, concluding that the cause of the crash was attempting the landing approach in conditions worse than the meteorological minima of the airfield, the aircraft, and the commander. The crew failed to make a timely decision to go-around. They descended below the established minimum safe altitude in the absence of reliable visual contact with runway or approach lights, which led to a collision of the aircraft with trees and terrain. The MAK commented that had the recommendations following the 2007 crash of UTair Flight 471 been implemented, the accident may have been prevented. A total of 19 safety recommendations were made.

War and society in Europe (1618-1648) On 16 September the city of Heidelberg was taken by storm, and the Heidelberg Castle surrendered three days later to the Imperial and Spanish forces.Horace Vere (DNB00) Background In 1620 the Spanish commander Don Ambrosio Spinola adopted Fabian tactics in the hope of wearing the enemy out, until the approach of winter compelled the English and their allies to seek quarters. Sir Horace Vere divided his troops among the three most important strongholds of the Palatinate. He himself occupied Mannheim, Sir Gerard Herbert he stationed in Heidelberg Castle, while Sir John Burroughs undertook to defend Frankenthal. Early in 1621 the Protestant Union was broken up, and the English garrisons had to give up all hope of relief. The English governors were not closely pressed that year. The garrison under Sir Horace Vere at Mannheim received a visit early in 1622 from the dethroned Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who had promised them a diversion, and who, in conjunction with Ernst von Mansfeld, had inflicted a momentary check upon the Imperialist army under Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly, at Wiesloch (April). A few weeks later, however, the Count of Tilly, having been reinforced by the Spanish army of Don Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, inflicted defeats on the Protestants, capturing a large number of German towns held by Protestants, and in June, Frederick V had finally to leave Mannheim. Siege of Heidelberg The combined Protestant forces, now numbering 25,000 strong, positioned themselves on the western bank of the Rhine and ceased challenging the invasion of the Palatinate. The English garrisons were now surrounded by a force of Imperialists and Spaniards under Tilly and C√≥rdoba. Heidelberg came under siege by the Imperial-Spanish forces. Vere resolved to hold out, though he knew that the military position was hopeless. In July 1622 it was decided that the Protestant force under Mansfeld and Brunswick should instead march through the Netherlands to lift the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom. When the Spanish learned of the move, C√≥rdoba was hastily recalled to intercept them. He did so in the bloody Battle of Fleurus on August 29, but the siege of Bergen still had to be aborted. After 11 weeks of resistance, Heidelberg fell on 19 September 1622. The English commander of the Protestant forces, Sir Gerard Herbert, was mortally wounded during the siege. Aftermath Frederick V of the Palatinate by Michiel van Mierevelt. Heidelberg Castle and the Hortus Palatinus commissioned by Frederick V, and designed by the English gardener Inigo Jones and the French engineer Salomon de Caus. The progress of the Spanish was unstoppable, and after the fall of Heidelberg, and the unsuccessful Protestant defense at Mannheim, the Spanish army captured the town. Finally, the defensive Anglo-Protestant forces under Sir Horace Vere, after a futile struggle, were defeated and capitulated. Only Frankenthal remained loyal to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, defended by the forces of Sir John Burroughs, but was taken one year later by the Spanish troops, thus leaving the Electorate of the Palatinate in the hands of the Spaniards.

Benjamin Payne in command; this was the second U.S. Navy ship to be named for the original HMS Boxer, which had been captured from the British during the War of 1812. Service history Her first mission was to the American Colonization Society (ACS) colony of Liberia, with orders to join the Peacock off the coast of Brazil and both to proceed to the Pacific in support of the frigate Potomac on the first Sumatran Expedition to suppress piracy in the East Indies; the ships fail to rendezvous until 5 June 1834, \\"in the unhealthy roadstead of Batavia.\\" Boxer then returned to join the West Indies Squadron. In 1835, she began a two-year tour of duty on the Pacific Station. After a period laid up undergoing repairs Boxer resumed duty on the Pacific Station from 1838 to 1840. Following two years apparently spent laid up, the schooner went to sea with the Home Squadron between 1842 and 1844. In 1846, Boxer was posted to the Africa Squadron, the primary mission of which was the suppression of the slave trade. That assignment lasted until the summer of 1848 when she returned to the United States. Boxer was sold at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 7 August 1848.

Plot Set in the depression-era 1930s America, \\"The Butterfly Circus\\" is set in a dismal time period, characterized by the unemployed and homeless masses, everyone concerned for the difficult economic situation. Mr. Mendez is the charismatic master of a small circus, the Butterfly Circus, and he leads his troupe through Southern California. Along the way, they perform ‚Äì sometimes for free ‚Äì to bring some light into the dull lives of people. One evening, they see a sign for a carnival with a sideshow. Upon arriving they see a fun fair with carousels, games, and other entertainment, including a freak show. Here Mr. Mendez meets Will, the main attraction of the freak show, who has tetra-amelia syndrome, meaning that Will is limbless: he is on display alongside other odd characters, such as a painted (tattoo)ed man and a bearded woman. Will is bitter and unhappy, but after meeting Mendez, he decides to leave the carnival, hiding on one of the Butterfly Circus trucks to escape. The people in the circus welcome Will, but Mr. Mendez tells him he must do something else than just be a freak to become part of the act. Will gets to know his new friends and learns that many of them have a sad past, but that Mr. Mendez has given them a second chance in life. One day Will accidentally realizes that he can swim, so he decides to perform a difficult act in the circus. He is raised to the top of a tall pole and dives into a small tank full of water. Will is now happy since he is in the show not because of his odd appearance but because of who he is and what he can do. Production The production was completed in 12 days by a cast and crew of over 150 people, on locations in the Southern California regions of the San Gabriel Mountains, Riverside, Palmdale and Santa Clarita.

SL 138 was one of the SL convoys from the South Atlantic to Britain, and MKS 28 one of the MKS convoys between Britain and the Mediterranean. They were sailing together on the Gibraltar homeward route, having made a rendezvous off Gibraltar in order to cross the Bay of Biscay with the maximum possible escort. They were the subject of a major U-boat attack in October 1943, the first battle in the Kriegsmarines renewed Autumn offensive. Background Following the defeats of May 1943, and the devastating losses incurred by the U-boat Arm (U-Bootwaffe) (UBW) Adm D√∂nitz had withdrawn from attacks on the North Atlantic route while awaiting tactical and technical improvements. By September 1943 these were ready, and U-boat Control (Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote)(BdU) had re-opened the offensive in the North Atlantic. After several disastrous convoy battles, which had cost the U-boat Arm 32 U-boats destroyed for little gain (three escorts and two merchant ships sunk, and several others damaged) BdU had again withdrawn from the North Atlantic battleground. As had happened after Black May he again switched the focus of the campaign to the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic routes, reasoning these would be softer targets. To this end he established the \\"wolfpack\\" Schill off the coast of Portugal, to intercept convoys sailing to and from Gibraltar, Mediterranean and South Atlantic. For the Allies, the success of Operation Torch and the re-opening of the Mediterranean to Allied traffic had led to the Allied convoy system in this area being re-organized. The previous OG/HG series to Gibraltar had been discontinued, to be replaced by the MKS/KMS series of ships to and from the Mediterranean. The OS/SL series to Freetown and the South Atlantic continued, but now the two routes were combined from Gibraltar; SL convoys from Freetown now making a rendezvous with MKS convoys from North African ports for the final leg of the journey to Britain. Similarly the OS and KMS convoys travelled together across the Bay of Biscay, before parting off Gibraltar. Protagonists SL 138 left Freetown on 13 October 1943, arriving off Gibraltar on 24 October. It comprised 44 ships and was escorted by 39 Escort Group, of seven warships led by the frigate Tavy (Lt.Cdr. F Ardern). MKS 28 sailed from Alexandria on 14 October; and after losing SS Tivives torpedoed by German aircraft off Cape T√©n√®s on 21 October, arrived off Gibraltar on 24 October to meet SL 138. The combined body of 60 ships escorted by a combined force of 12 warships then sailed for Britain. The Schill patrol group initially comprised eight U-boats, but one of these, U-441 was attacked by Allied aircraft and forced to return. The seven boats that remained on station deployed in a patrol line west of Portugal, while aircraft of the Luftwaffe from searched the ocean for any sign of the approaching convoys. On 27 October 1943 a German reconnaissance aircraft sighted SL 138 and MKS 28 and reported their position. Action SL 138/MKS 28 was sighted three days out from the Strait of Gibraltar by a German BV 222 reconnaissance aircraft, on 27 October 1943, in the ocean to the west of Lisbon, and following this the Schill boats began to gather for an attack. On 29 October Francke in U-262 made contact and began to shadow the convoy; by evening he had been joined by two others, U-333 and U-306 and they commenced the attack. One ship was hit, the Norwegian freighter Hallfried, but all other attacks were driven off. On 30 October the escort was joined by the destroyers Whitehall and Wrestler, which had been sent as reinforcement; during that day and the following night the Schill boats had no success. On 31 October, as the convoy came within range of air cover from Britain, Whitehall and Geranium were able to catch U-306, which was destroyed by depth charges.Kemp p154 With no further success after two days and nights of trying, and now with the loss of one of the Schill boats, the attack was called off and the wolf pack withdrew. SL 138 and MKS 28 continued with no further incident and arrived at Liverpool on 5 November 1943. Aftermath With just one ship sunk, for the loss of one U-boat, the attack on SL 138/MKS 28 was hardly an auspicious start to BdU's renewed offensive. The Royal Navy, meanwhile, could take heart that the success they had achieved in the North Atlantic, with convoy after convoy making its \\"safe and timely arrival\\" could also be achieved on the Biscay route.

This feature first arose among the Therapsida (mammal-like reptiles) during the Permian, and has continued to the present day. All Therapsid groups with the exception of the mammals are now extinct, but each of these groups possessed different tooth patterns, which aids with the classification of fossils. Mammal teeth include incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, not all of which are present in all mammals. Various evolutionary modifications have occurred, such as the lack of canines in Glires, the development of tusks from either incisors (elephants) or canines (pigs and walruses), the adaptation of molars into flesh-shearing carnassials in Carnivora, and others. Diversity The extant mammalian infraclasses each have a set dental formula; the Eutheria (placental mammals) commonly have three pairs of molars and four premolars per jaw, whereas the Metatheria (marsupials) generally have four pairs of molars and between three or two premolars. For example, the tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) is a dasyurid marsupial native to Australia. The quoll possesses four upper incisors and three lower incisors per left and right-hand side [I = 14]; two upper premolars [PM] and two lower premolars per side [PM = 8]; and four upper and four lower molars per side [M = 16], giving the animal a complement of thirty-eight teeth. The tiger quoll's dental formula is as follows: . =Rabbits= Rabbits and other lagomorphs usually shed their deciduous teeth before (or very shortly after) their birth, and are usually born with their permanent teeth.Dental Anatomy & Care for Rabbits and Rodents The teeth of rabbits complement their diet, which consist of a wide range of vegetation. Since many of the foods are abrasive enough to cause attrition, rabbit teeth grow continuously throughout life.Brown, Susan. Rabbit Dental Diseases , hosted on the San Diego Chapter of the House Rabbit Society. Page accessed April 9, 2007. Rabbits have a total of 6 incisors (two upper and one lower on either side), three upper premolars on each side of the maxillary bone (total of six), three upper molars on each side, two lower premolars on each side of the jaw, and two lower molars on each side of the jaw. There are no canines. Three to four millimeters of tooth is worn away by incisors every week, whereas the posterior teeth require a month to wear away the same amount.Ry≈°avy, Robin. The Missouri House Rabbit Society, hosted by the Kansas City Missouri House Rabbit Society. Page accessed April 9, 2007. Anatomy of rabbit teeth The incisors and cheek teeth of rabbits are called aradicular hypsodont teeth. Aradicular teeth never form a true root with an apex, and hypsodont teeth have a high crown to root ratio (providing more room for wear and tear). This is sometimes referred to as an elodont dentition, meaning ever-growing. These teeth grow or erupt continuously. The growth or eruption is held in balance by dental abrasion from chewing a diet high in fiber. =Rodents= Like those of rabbits, rodents' incisors grow continuously throughout their lives, and are both aradicular and hypsodont. Unlike humans whose ameloblasts die after tooth development, rodents continually produce enamel and must wear down their teeth by gnawing on various materials.Caceci, Thomas. Veterinary Histology with subtitle \\"Digestive System: Oral Cavity\\" found here . These teeth are used for cutting wood, biting through the skin of fruit, or for defense. The teeth have enamel on the outside and exposed dentin on the inside, so they self-sharpen during gnawing. On the other hand, continually growing molars are found in some rodent species, such as the sibling vole and the guinea pig.Tummers M and Thesleff I. Root or crown: a developmental choice orchestrated by the differential regulation of the epithelial stem cell niche in the tooth of two rodent species. Development (2003). 130(6):1049-57.AM Hunt. A description of the molar teeth and investing tissues of normal guinea pigs. J Dent Res. (1959) 38(2):216-31. There is variation in the dentition of the rodents, but generally, rodents lack canines and premolars, and have a space between their incisors and molars, called the diastema region. =Humans= = Afrotherians = Elephants Section through the ivory tusk of a mammoth Elephants' tusks are specialized incisors for digging food up and fighting. Elephants are polyphyodonts with teeth are similar to those in manatees, and it is notable that elephants are believed to have undergone an aquatic phase in their evolution. Elephants have four molars, one on each side of the upper and lower jaw. Until age 40, these are replaced by larger molars. The new molars shift forward from the back of the jaw as the old wear down. The final set of molars last for about twenty years.Bram, L. et al. MCMLXXXIII. Elephants. Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia, Volume 9, p. 183. Manatees Manatees are polyphyodonts with mandibular molars developing separately from the jaw and are encased in a bony shell separated by soft tissue. Aardvarks In Aardvarks, teeth lack enamel and have many pulp tubules, hence the name of the order Tubulidentata. = Ungulates = Horses An adult horse has between 36 and 44 teeth. All horses have twelve premolars, twelve molars, and twelve incisors. Generally, all male equines also have four canine teeth (called tushes) between the molars and incisors. However, few female horses (less than 28%) have canines, and those that do usually have only one or two, which many times are only partially erupted. A few horses have one to four wolf teeth, which are vestigial premolars, with most of those having only one or two. They are equally common in male and female horses and much more likely to be on the upper jaw. If present these can cause problems as they can interfere with the horse's bit contact. Therefore, wolf teeth are commonly removed. Horse teeth can be used to estimate the animal's age. Between birth and five years, age can be closely estimated by observing the eruption pattern on milk teeth and then permanent teeth. By age five, all permanent teeth have usually erupted. The horse is then said to have a \\"full\\" mouth. After the age of five, age can only be conjectured by study of the wear patterns on the incisors, shape, the angle at which the incisors meet, and other factors. The wear of teeth may also be affected by diet, natural abnormalities, and cribbing. Two horses of the same age may have different wear patterns. A horse's incisors, premolars, and molars, once fully developed, continue to erupt as the grinding surface is worn down through chewing. A young adult horse will have teeth which are 4.5-5 inches long, with the majority of the crown remaining below the gumline in the dental socket. The rest of the tooth will slowly emerge from the jaw, erupting about 1/8\\" each year, as the horse ages. When the animal reaches old age, the crowns of the teeth are very short and the teeth are often lost altogether. Very old horses, if lacking molars, may need to have their fodder ground up and soaked in water to create a soft mush for them to eat in order to obtain adequate nutrition.  Pigs  Tusks, which grow larger in males and in wild boars, are derived from the canine teeth, a trait shared with warthogs. Cetaceans The toothed whales, comprising the Odontoceti suborder of the cetaceans, are differentiated from the baleen whales by the presence of their teeth. The number of teeth and their function can vary widely between species, with some dolphins having over a hundred teeth in their jaws, while the Narwhal has two functional teeth in its upper jaw which grow into long tusks in males. The tusk is used in feeding, navigation and mating and contains millions of sensory pathways, making it the most neurologically complex tooth known. In contrast, the Sperm whale has up to forty teeth in its bottom jaw and none functional in its upper. = Carnivorans = In the order Carnivora, either the molars, or the premolars and molars in combination, may be adapted into shearing carnassials. Walrus Walrus tusks are canine teeth that grow continuously throughout life.The Permanent Canine Teeth, hosted on the University of Illinois at Chicago website. Page accessed February 5, 2007. Dogs In dogs, the teeth are less likely than humans to form dental cavities because of the very high pH of dog saliva, which prevents enamel from demineralizing.Chris C.

She was created Marchesa of Spigno. Lady-in-waiting Born at the Palazzo Canalis, Turin in 1680, she was a daughter of Francesco Maurizio Canalis, Count of Cumiana and his wife Monica Francesca San Martino d'Agli√®. Receiving education as a nun at the Convent of the Visitation in Turin, she was introduced to the ducal court of Savoy in 1695. She was made a lady-in-waiting to Marie Jeanne of Savoy, mother of the ruler, Victor Amadeus II. She was styled as Mademoiselle de Cumiana. She was married on 21 April 1703 to Ignazio Francesco Novarina, the Count of San Sebastiano, by whom she purportedly had seven children. The marriage was arranged by Duchess Marie Jeanne, to whose household she belonged and who had noticed her son's wandering eye looking in the direction of the beautiful and unmarried Anna.Vitelleschi Vol II, p 499 The couple's first child is widely believed to have been fathered by Victor Amadeus but San Sebastiano accepted paternity. Victor Amadeus and Anna were in correspondence and she soon became a confidante in place of his wife, Anne Marie. Leaving the court in 1723 with her husband who had a good career, she soon became a widow at her husband's death on 25 September 1724. Left with limited means, Victor Amadeus called her back to court where she was made a lady-in-waiting to Polyxena, Princess of Piedmont, wife of Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont and heir apparent of Victor Amadeus II. She was later elevated to the position of Polyxena's lady-in-waiting, where she given a position equivalent to Lady of the Bedchamber. Marriage to King Victor Amadeus In August 1728 Victor Amadeus's consort Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans died after a series of heart attacks.Vitelleschi Vol II, p 495 Two years later he married Anna in a private ceremony on 12 August 1730 in the Royal Chapel in Turin, having obtained permission from Pope Clement XII. Victor Amadeus created her Marchesa of Spigno. The title was attached to a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, acquired as spoils of the War of the Spanish Succession and subsequently owned by an illegitimate brother of Victor Amadeus.Symcox, p 229 The couple made their marriage public on 3 September 1730, much to the dismay of the court. A month later, Victor Amadeus announced his wish to abdicate the throne and did so in a ceremony at the Castle of Rivoli on the day of his marriage. His son succeeded him as Charles Emmanuel III. Taking the style of King Victor Amadeus, he and Anna moved into the ch√¢teau de Chamb√©ry outside the capital. The couple took a small retinue of servants and Victor Amadeus was kept informed of matters of state. Under the influence of Anna and despite having suffered a stroke in 1731, Victor Amadeus decided he wanted to resume his tenure on the throne and informed his son of his decision.Symcox, p 231 Arrested by his son, he was transported to the Castle of Moncalieri and Anna was taken to a house for reformed prostitutes at the Castle of Ceva but was later allowed to return to the Castle of Rivoli where her husband was moved. She was returned to him on 12 April. The stroke seemed to have affected Victor Amadeus in a way which caused him to later turn violent toward his wife, blaming her for his misfortunes.Symcox, p 232 Victor Amadeus II, Anna's morganatic husband by Mytens who created her Marchioness of Spigno King Victor Amadeus having died in September 1732, Anna was imprisoned in the Convent of San Giuseppe di Carignano. She was later moved to the Convent of the Visitation in Pinerolo where she died aged 88. Her son later left the Savoy court in disgrace but succeeded to the marquisate of Spigno.Exshaw, p 78 She was buried at Pinerolo in a grave without a headstone.

Over the course of his career, he has worked with artists including Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, ABBA, Eurythmics, Rihanna, Sam Smith, Take That, Psychedelic Furs, The Rolling Stones, Sting, Jamie Cullum and Andrea Bocelli. Grainge has worked in the music business for his entire career. Billboard magazine named Grainge as the most powerful person in the music business on four occasions in the 2010s, and the first- ever Executive of the Decade. Early life and career Grainge grew up in North London. He was raised Jewish.https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/sir- lucian-grainge-we-must-keep-listening-to-new-ideas-through-young-ears/ Grainge left Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys at the age of 18, and began working as a runner at MPC, a talent scout company. After contacting several record label bosses, he was offered a job by Maurice Oberstein, chairman of CBS Records, working at publishing company April Music's A&R; department. His first signing was The Psychedelic Furs. In 1982, he became the director of RCA Music Publishing. Two years later he became an A&R; director for MCA Records. He set up PolyGram Music Publishing in 1986 and joined Polydor as general manager of A&R; and business affairs in 1993. He was promoted to managing director of Polydor in 1997. Universal Music Group Grainge became the chairman of the UK division of the Universal Music Group, and then in 2005 of Universal Music Group International. He served in this position until 2010. On 1 January 2011 he became CEO of Universal Music Group, and then chairman on 9 March 2011, succeeding Doug Morris. Within his first year as chairman & CEO of Universal, the company acquired EMI's Recorded Music operations. Grainge argued that selling to Universal was the only way to improve EMI, for the benefit of the entire industry. UMG subsequently attempted to revitalise former EMI labels including Capitol Records and Virgin Records. Commenting on the EMI acquisition, Buzzfeed commented that \\"Grainge will go down as the master architect of what is likely to be the last big deal in the music business\\". As chairman and Chief Executive of Universal, Grainge has also sought to increase the group's international digital expansion via distribution partnerships with technology companies, including Apple, Spotify, Facebook, Tencent, and YouTube. Grainge led the 2017 multi-year global license agreement between UMG and Spotify. Grainge led the acquisition of Bravado, then part of Sanctuary, and transformed it into UMG's entertainment merchandising and brand management division, Bravado. The company represents artists including Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, and Kanye West, and has formed partnerships with retailers including Barneys, Bloomingdale's and Selfridge's. Grainge also oversaw the expansion of classical labels Deutsche Grammophon and Decca Classics, and agreed a global strategic partnership with entertainment company Live Nation. In 2017, UMG was worth $22 billion, triple what it was worth when Grainge took over at the company. In July 2018, JPMorgan said that UMG could be worth as much as $40 billion and then increased the valuation to $50 billion in 2019. In 2015, Vivendi announced that Grainge had agreed to extend his tenure as UMG's chairman and CEO until at least 2020, stating he was key to its strategy. Under his management, UMG experienced growth in annual revenue, digital recorded music revenue and EBITDA. Personal life In January 1993, Grainge married his first wife, attorney Samantha Berg. That November, she experienced complications while giving birth to their son, and fell into a coma from which she never recovered. She died in England in 2007. In 2002, Grainge married his second wife, Caroline. Their daughter was born in 2001. In November 2012 Grainge and his wife reportedly paid US$13 million for a house in Pacific Palisades. They had previously leased a Brentwood home from the owner of Rhino Entertainment. His older brother was Nigel Grainge, the founder of Ensign Records. Honours and awards In 2008, Grainge received the Music Industry Trusts' Award, which recognises the world's most successful music executives. The award was presented by members of U2, and Take That performed at the ceremony.

In October 2016, Variety presented Grainge with its 2016 Empowerment Award for overseeing a \\"noticeable shift in the demographics of the industry leader‚Äôs C-suites\\" with women occupying some of the highest executive positions at Universal Music Group. In May 2017, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity announced that Grainge would be honored as the 2017 Media Person of the Year, the first music executive to receive this honour. Philip Thomas, CEO of Ascential Events, organizers of Cannes Lions, praised his \\"bold investments in music and technology that helped return the industry to growth, while continuing to foster an environment that puts artists first\\".

He is the only person to ever hold that distinction more than once and for consecutive years. Irving Azoff called him \\"'the great hope for the music business'\\" and Jimmy Iovine commented that Grainge \\"is working to restore [a] spirit of risk-taking and innovation\\" by being \\"'willing and open to entrepreneurship and that kind of thing the record industry has gotten depleted of.'\\" An interview feature in Billboard described Grainge as \\"a fierce and tireless advocate for the recorded-music business\\". In 2013, CNET wrote that ‚ÄúGrainge is positioning Universal to lead the pack‚Äù of major labels in their embracing of new digital opportunities. A 2014 front-page Los Angeles Times profile said that \\"if anyone can save the music business, it might be Grainge.\\" In January 2020, Grainge was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with UMG artists including Beck, Justin Bieber, Birdman, Lewis Capaldi, Tori Kelly, Sam Smith, and Hailee Steinfeld in attendance. Shawn Mendes and Lionel Richie were the ceremony's featured presenters.

The band first emerged on the music scene when musicians Tom Ambeau (drums, guitar), Milt Budarick (bass guitar), Bert DesRochers (piano), Larry French (lead guitar, vocals) and Gary French (lead vocals, drums), formed The Corvettes. Rock and roll was becoming a powerful force on the music scene and The Corvettes became a part of that, playing concerts throughout Ontario. The Corvettes would go on to become the backing band for Canada's first teen idol Bobby Curtola. Changing their name to Bobby Curtola & The Martells (the name change was required after an American band was recording under the same name. The name The Martell‚Äôs came from Curtola's manager, Maria Martell). In 1961, the band went on to record hits with Curtola such as \\"Indian Giver\\", \\"Hand in Hand with You\\", and \\"Fortune Teller\\". The band also toured across Canada with Curtola in one of Canada‚Äôs first rock n roll tours and backed up other with big stars of the day such as Del Shannon, Gordon Lightfoot, Linda Lane, Shirley Matthews and more. The Martells disbanded in the late 1960s, but in 1979, the band reunited and continued playing together until retiring in 2015.

A high status piece, it is likely to have been worn as a choker neck ornament for ceremonial purposes. It dates from around 400 to 800 AD. The chain is one of ten certain examples of this type, and is on display at the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Description Detail of penannular ring, with Pictish symbols Weighing 1.8 kg and measuring approximately 50 cm in length, the chain consists of 44 silver rings interlinked into 22 pairs. According to Clark, the chain originally had 23 pairs of rings, but was damaged subsequent to its discovery.) The paired ring chain is joined by a large penannular piece with expanded flanges. The penannular ring bears Pictish symbols of the sort typically found on Class I and II Pictish standing stones. On one side of the opening in the ring, there is a zigzag pattern and a double disc and Z-rod symbol, bearing similarity to those on the silver plaques found in the Norrie's Law hoard. On the other side of the opening, there is a notched rectangle symbol, decorated with a pair of circles, running lengthwise along the rectangle and attached to opposite edges of the rectangle. This design is similar to that found on a stone found at Westfield, Falkland as well as a number of notched rectangles that are further decorated with Z-rods. The penannular ring was apparently used as a fastener to link the terminal ends of the chain together into a choker neck ornament. Findspot The Whitecleuch chain was found in May 1869 on land belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch at Whitecleuch, Lanarkshire, Scotland. The initial report, made by Smith (1874), described the location of the find as being \\"in the vicinity of Drumlanrig Castle\\" in Dumfries and Galloway. The precise location was later clarified as being 12 miles north of the castle, in pasture land known as Rough Flow Moss, Whitecleuch.(). This has caused a certain amount of confusion, with both sites being listed in some censuses of Pictish chains.See for example: The chain was found at a depth of around 45 cm in the ground and was exposed by erosion of the edges of a drainage ditch. The location of the find in the South West of Scotland, some distance from the Pictish territory is of no real significance due to the portable nature of the chain.

On its release however, The Voice of Merrill was recognised by its distributors, Eros Films, as unusually sophisticated and stylish for a B-movie, and was elevated to the status of co-feature in cinemas.Steve Chibnall & Brian McFarlane, The British 'B' Film, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2009, p. 134. Plot A convicted female blackmailer is found murdered in her flat and suspicion falls on three men, all of whom the police believe might have had a motive: struggling author Hugh Allen (Edward Underdown) was involved in a relationship with the dead woman; Allen's publisher Ronald Parker (Henry Kendall), who had been blackmailed out of several thousand pounds while she was in his employ, and playwright Jonathan Roach (James Robertson Justice) who knew the woman but is evasive about the exact nature of their acquaintance. None of the three can provide a verifiable alibi for the time of the murder, so Inspector Thornton (Garry Marsh) decides to shadow them in the belief that sooner or later the guilty party will betray himself. Meanwhile, Allen has fallen in love with Roach's wife Alycia (Valerie Hobson), who is tired of her loveless marriage, and the pair begin an affair. Roach is suffering from a heart condition and his life expectancy may be as little as a few months. He has written an episodic radio play, \\"The Voice of Merrill\\", which he wants to present anonymously and he agrees to Alycia's suggestion that Allen should be the narrator on the broadcasts. Alycia persuades Allen to go along with a plot to pass off the play as Allen's own work in an attempt to boost his career. Alycia then poisons Roach with his medications, trusting that his death will be attributed to his medical condition. But Thornton knows about her affair with Allen, and when Roach dies, Thornton has suspicions, and Alycia is horrified when he informs her that an autopsy will be carried out. Allen tells Alycia that he will confess to the murder rather than see her charged, but she attempts to dissuade him. When the autopsy results come back, they show that Roach died of natural causes, so the couple believe that they are off the hook. However, prior to his death, Roach had seen newspaper reports that Allen was the anonymous \\"Merrill\\", and was angry that Allen was not denying them. So he has set up an elaborate posthumous revenge, and, as the last episode of \\"The Voice of Merrill\\" is broadcast, Thornton realises that the storyline is pointing him towards the blackmailer's killer.

Early life  In May 1869, Lum was born as Bertha Boynton Bull in Tipton, Iowa. Lum's father was Joseph W. Bull (1841‚Äì1923), a lawyer and her mother was Harriet Ann Boynton (1842‚Äì1925), a school teacher. Both of Lum's parents were amateur artists.Gravalos, Mary Evans O'Keefe & Carol Pulin. Bertha Lum American Printmakers series (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1991) p. 102. Lum had a sister and two brothers, Clara, Carlton, and Emerson.  Education and Career  In 1890 she lived in Duluth and listed her occupation as artist. She enrolled in the design department of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1895. A few years later she studied stained glass with Anne Weston and attended the Frank Holme School of Illustration. From November 1901 to March 1902, she studied figure drawing at the Art Institute of Chicago and was influenced by the Japanese techniques of Arthur Wesley Dow in his book Composition, which was published in 1899.Bertha Boynton Lum, Kites, 1913. Woodblock print.Lum married Burt F. Lum, a corporate lawyer from Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1903. They spent their seven-week honeymoon in Japan, where she searched for a print maker who could teach her the traditional ukiyo-e method. Toward the end of her stay in Japan, she found a shop that reproduced old prints. The shop sold her some woodcutting tools that she began using upon her return to Minneapolis. On January 23, 1907 she went to Japan for a 14-week stay. With help from a professor at the Imperial Art School in Tokyo, she was introduced to the block cutter Igami Bonkutsu (1875-1933) in Yokohama. Lum worked with Bonkutsu for two months. After she learned how to cut blocks, Bonkutsu introduced her to the printer Nishimura Kamakichi, with whom she worked for another four weeks. For three years in the U.S., Lum cut blocks and colored and printed her work herself. The Society of Arts and Crafts in Boston named Lum a master craftsman in 1908. After returning to Japan in 1911 for six months, she began to hire cutters and printers who worked in her winter home in Tokyo. In 1912 Lum was the only female artist to exhibit at the Tokyo International Exhibition. She was awarded a silver medal at the 1915 Panama- Pacific International Exposition for her color woodcuts. Between 1915 and 1919 she made two more trips to Japan and made an extensive number of prints. She also exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1920 and at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Society of Etchers, as well as the New York Public Library. Her first illustrated book, Gods, Goblins, and Ghosts, based on her travels in Japan, was published in 1922. The same year, she moved to China and began learning Chinese woodcut methods. During the Great Depression, Lum made a living selling prints and illustrating books, newspapers, and magazines, including the New York Herald Tribune and Good Housekeeping. She made her last known print in 1935; her print of the god Da√Økoku was published in The Peking Chronicle in December 1937. In 1936 she published Gangplanks to the East, a collection of Asian folk tales and stories of her travels. She had her last exhibition in 1941. Her works are held at the Library of Congress, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, and in private collections. Lum was a member of the Asiatic Society of Japan, California Society of Etchers (now California Society of Printmakers), and Print Makers Society of California.  Personal life  Lum lived in California (San Francisco and Hollywood) from 1917 until 1922 when she moved to Peking, China. For the next thirty years she divided her time between California, China, and Japan. She divorced Burt Lum in the 1920s. Her younger daughter Eleanor \\"Peter\\" Lum married the diplomat Sir Colin Tradescant Crowe and became an author. In 1936 her elder daughter Catherine married Antonio Riva, an Italian pilot during World War I who was executed in 1951 in Beijing for an alleged plot to assassinate Mao Zedong. Lum had been staying with Catherine at the time of Riva's arrest and was herself placed under house arrest. In 1953 Lum left China and moved with Catherine to Genoa, Italy. She died in Genoa, Italy in February 1954.

The congregation, which was located at 4401 Hatton Point Road, was called A Family of Traditional and Non-Traditional Families and was a member of the Union for Reform Judaism. The congregation was headed by Rabbi Arthur Z. Steinberg, of blessed memory. Temple Sinai celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2004. Temple Sinai merged with Norfolk's Ohef Sholom Temple in June 2012. History Temple Sinai was founded on December 2, 1953, during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Its seven sponsoring members agreed on the congregation's name within a few days and held their first religious service at the Portsmouth Women's Club on January 8, 1954. Until the construction of its building, services were also held at the Portsmouth Coca- Cola Bottling Works and the Suburban Country Club. The cornerstone for the building on its site on Hatton Point Road was laid in 1956. Temple Sinai marked its fiftieth anniversary in June 2004. Portsmouth United Religious School Temple Sinai and Gomley Chesed, a nearby synagogue also located in Portsmouth, have formed a combined religious school program, Portsmouth United Religious School. The Portsmouth United Religious School, also known as \\"Portsmouth Religious School\\" and by the acronym \\"PURS\\", is an award-winning family education program and outreach for the total Jewish community. Activities Temple Sinai emphasized religious education and service to the community through social action. Temple Sinai helped provide food for the hungry and shelter for the homeless. As the only Jewish congregation among fifty congregations of the Portsmouth Volunteers for the Homeless, Temple Sinai distinguished itself by opening its doors for fifty to sixty homeless people during Christmas week, so that their Christian partners can be at home with their families during this season. In this work it was also affiliated with MAZON's \\"3% Circle\\", in which 3% of the cost of the temple's holiday dinners and lifecycle celebrations were donated to MAZON. Temple Sinai engaged in pulpit exchanges with Gomley Chesed and with Ohef Sholom Temple of Norfolk, Virginia. A pulpit exchange involves a visit of one congregation to the other congregation's facility for a special combined service. Notes  Bibliography  * Paywall.

It was available at booksellers on October 12, 2010. It is the first in a series of books that Duff became committed to write. Elise Allen collaborated on the first book with Duff, and became committed to work jointly with her on the others. The book is now a New York Times Best Seller. Plot Clea Raymond is a talented photojournalist and the daughter of high-profile parents. Usually she‚Äôs in total control of her camera, but after Clea‚Äôs father disappears while on a humanitarian mission, eerie, shadowy images of a strange and handsome young man begin to appear in Clea‚Äôs photos‚Äîa man she has never seen in her life. When Clea suddenly encounters this man in person she is stunned‚Äîand feels an immediate and powerful connection. As they grow closer, they are drawn deep into the mystery behind her father‚Äôs disappearance and discover the centuries-old truth behind their intense bond. Torn by a dangerous love triangle and haunted by a powerful secret that holds their fate, together they race against time to unravel their past in order to save their future‚Äîand their lives. Creation process Duff said, in an interview she gave to Seventeen Magazine about the creation of Elixir, \\"I have been playing with the idea for a few years now. It's a lot of fun and at the same time, very challenging.\\" Duff informed the magazine that she had had the idea in her mind for a long time, first with a series of short scripts, but then, following encouragement from her mother, she decided to convert the concept into a book, recruiting Elise Allen to assist her with the writing. About the paranormal aspect of Elixir, Duff remarked: \\"I have always been interested in the paranormal and afterlife, everything from ghosts to angels. I think that everyone has that curiosity of the great unknown.\\" Reviews Star Magazine gave Elixir 3 out of 4 stars, being positively surprised with Duff's writing. The New York Post wrote, \\"It has everything: romance and the supernatural; a globe-trotting Hillary Clinton-esque mom; characters with names like Sage and Clea...and a shout-out to Page Six!\\" MTV's Book Report gave Elixir a very positive review, saying it was ready for \\"another dose\\" of Elixir. MTV also said that \\"Elixir is crying out for a movie adaptation\\" and suggested that maybe Hilary Duff herself should take the main role. Elixir also reached the New York Times' Best Sellers List at #10 in Children's Chapter Books for one week. Sequels Duff had already stated multiple times that she would write a couple of sequels to Elixir, all in collaboration with Allen. In an interview with CosmoGirl! Magazine, she said: \\"Clea has been on an emotional rollercoaster, so that is probably where the next book will start. Clea will need to find a way to pick herself up and put the pieces of her life back together. Who knows how long that could take? And what her next move will be? Hopefully her dreams will guide her. IF she can dream.\\" But she had said that she had not set anything in stone as yet and that she and her co-writer, Allen, were simply playing around with different ideas. Duff teased on Twitter about a sequel: \\"Can‚Äôt believe so many people have read the book already! Yipeeee! Starting the next one in two weeks\\". The trade paperback version hit shelves June 7, 2011 as only the hardcover and ebook was released on October 12, 2010. A sequel, titled Devoted, hit book shelves on October 11, 2011. Duff announced in July 2012 that the third and final novel in the Elixir series would be titled True. The book was released on April 16, 2013 by Simon & Schuster.\\" References Category:2010 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Hilary Duff Category:2010 debut novels ","title":"Elixir (Duff novel)"},{"id":"28238229","text":"Stephen James Taylor (born 28 September 1954) is an American composer best known for his film and TV scores with four Emmy nominations, two Annie nominations, and a DVD-X Award on \\"Best Original Score (for a DVD Premiere Movie) to date ('05).Awards for Stephen James Taylor His style is a blend of pop, classical, jazz, world music and experimental surround sound genres.

Structure  The building is a U-shape with the parliament building engulfed around. Due to the city's soft landscape, the Northern Wing of the building sunk a few meters underground. To support it, the Eastern and the Western Wing was constructed and finished in 1905. The building originally consists of 16 cupolas but only eight of them survived. They are designed similar in structure of the Crown of Queen Victoria. The steel used in the support structure of the buildings was shipped in from Glasgow, Scotland and the original roof tiles were manufactured in France while the bricks and teak for the woodwork were locally sourced across Asia.  Parliament Building  The Parliament building was built in 1919. It is the very place where the independence of the country was handed over by the British on the 4th of January 1948. In-front of the building is the flagpole where the Union Jack was lowered and the flag of Independent Burma was raised. Just a few meters away from it is a brick monument memorizing the 7 fallen ministers of the 1947 assassination.(Ko Htwe and U Ohn Maung weren't ministers). The assassination of Bogyoke Aung San This building is where General Aung San, the father of modern Myanmar, spent his working days. On 19 July 1947, during a meeting of the Executive Council at the Ministers Building, Aung San and six cabinet ministers were assassinated by a gang of armed paramilitaries. They had been sent by the former Prime Minister U Saw. This day is now commemorated as Burmese Martyrs' Day. The building is currently on the Yangon City Heritage List and restoration work is underway, parts of the complex are open to the public and there is an informative guided tour for a fee. Restoration Two of the four towers on the corner buildings as well as the central dome collapsed during an earthquake in the 1930s. The building has been vacant since the government was moved to the new capital Naypyidaw. The government debated whether to restore it and turn it into a hotel or museum. In 2011, amid national discussions on converting Yangon's colonial-era buildings to attract tourism, plans were made to convert the Ministers' Building into a museum, not a hotel. In February 2012, seven local companies and three foreign companies submitted a proposal to the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) to convert the Ministers' Building into a Martyrs' Museum, culture aspect and theme park. Anawmar Art Group will operate the museum under the guidance of historians, curators and the Yangon Heritage Trust. The room where the assassination had taken place had been used as a Buddhist shrine until 2016. Availability to public = Daily Guided Heritage Tours = The Secretariat now offers Daily Guided Heritage Tours to visitors for a peek behind closed doors and construction scaffolding. Explore the history of the colossal colonial building and learn the details of the complex‚Äôs multi-year renovation effort while being escorted by an expert local guide. Your ‚Äùinsider‚Äôs‚Äù journey through The Secretariat Yangon will take you to see the stately interior of the historic Yangon Parliament House where Burma‚Äôs self-rule first began and the West Wing location of the assassination of General Aung San, the father of Modern Myanmar, and 6 cabinet members on 19 July 1947, as well as into areas that are still under renovation. As you and your guide wind your way through the layers of history you will see original teak wood details, soaring ceiling heights, and if construction activity allows, the impressive double spiral iron staircase in the South Wing of the complex. Tours are available every hour starting at 9:30am and the final tour will depart at 4:30pm.

On July 19, 2017, the country celebrated the 70th anniversary of Martyrs' Day. For the first time since the building closed, the Yangon Parliament House, located within the Secretariat compound and the Cabinet Meeting Room, was opened to the public. The building saw 42,101 Myanmar citizens and 205 foreigners come to honor their fallen heroes. The national museum brought in original furniture and artifacts from the time of assassination that had been in the room. Articles included were labeled chairs that seated the fallen martyrs, fountain pens, pencils, keys, wristwatches, blankets, lighters, cigarette boxes, money and signed notes that they used daily. Ko Htwe, a bodyguard who was also assassinated, was also remembered with a marker of where his body fell after being shot. =Visit by U.S. President Obama= In November, 2014, the United States President Barack Obama visited the building to honor the fallen. While on his tour of the building, Obama offered assistance with urban development and heritage protection. The president was accompanied Dr. Thant Myint-U, the Chairman of the Yangon Heritage Trust. = Wolfgang Laib Exhibit = Parts of the southeast wing of the building opened to the public on January 14 to February 4, 2017 for the art exhibit Where the Land and Water End by the German artist Wolfgang Laib. For the exhibit, Laib created one of his pollen installations at the base of the double spiral staircase but due to the conditions of the space it was only left up for the first two days of the exhibit. Also on display was one of his famous milkstones and a fleet of brass ships surrounded by rice.

It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner and Tracy McMillan, and directed by Michael Uppendahl. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on August 1, 2010. The episode opens in December 1964, as Sterling Cooper Draper Price is hosting a Christmas party. As the company faces financial problems because of its limited client base and expensive new office space, Don Draper's private life becomes ever more chaotic. Critical reception of the episode was positive. Plot Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is planning a scaled-down Christmas party, but when Lee Garner, Jr., of the client Lucky Strike, which represents 73% of all SCDP billings, invites himself to the event, the company has to go all out. Joan puts the party together in hours, assisted by one of the girls, Megan. Garner gets drunk and makes increasingly offensive demands of the SCDP staff, ultimately publicly humiliating Roger Sterling by forcing him to put on a Santa suit. A more hopeful occurrence is the return of a sobered-up Freddy Rumsen, who brings along Pond's, a valuable new client, which he poached from J. Walter Thompson. He is opposed to Pete Campbell working on the account, though. In addition to not thinking well of Pete, Freddy was fired by Duck due to Pete telling him about Freddy's drunkenness. Don Draper's life continues to unravel, as Dr. Faye Miller - a female psychologist from a hired consumer research company - brings to light his issues with his own past. She tells Don it always comes down to \\"what I want vs. what is expected of me,\\" and tells him he'll be married again within a year. A drunken Don's encounter with Phoebe - a young nurse from across the hall - leads nowhere, but he later ends up having sex with his secretary Allison--a line he has never before crossed-- which leads to awkwardness in the workplace. Peggy Olson is initially happy about Freddy's return--it was due to his recommendation that Peggy began doing copywriting--but finds working with him difficult, due to his dated attitudes toward advertising and toward women, and she speaks to him harshly about how he is \\"old-fashioned\\". She has also come to an impasse in her relationship with her boyfriend Mark, who thinks she is still a virgin. After Freddy counsels her that a man won't respect (or by implication, marry) a woman who sleeps with him out of wedlock, but not sleeping with a man gives painful \\"blue balls\\", Peggy decides to sleep with Mark. Meanwhile, Don's daughter Sally is having problems accepting her father's absence, especially during the Christmas season. Glen Bishop, the neighbor's boy, has taken an unhealthy interest in Sally and ends up vandalizing the Francis residence, though he leaves Sally's room untouched except for a token in her room that indicates to her who the culprit was. Production The title \\"Christmas Comes But Once a Year\\" is from the title of an original Stan Freberg song mocking the advertising industry on his 1958 comedy single, \\"Green Christmas\\" (Freberg's title is borrowed from the 1936 animated short of the same name). The episode was written by executive producer Matthew Weiner, who has written a number of episodes, and Tracy McMillan. It was directed by Michael Uppendahl, who had directed three previous episodes of the series. The episode also saw the return of Joel Murray in the role of Freddy Rumsen, for the first time since the season two episode \\"Six Month Leave\\". After the season premiere episode \\"Public Relations\\", series creator Matthew Weiner was displeased about the amount of disclosure that occurred before the episode aired, through the release of promotional clips. Consequently, the amount of information revealed about the second episode was severely reduced. Pond's Cold Cream, the account brought in by Rumsen, is a real-life product by Unilever. This product placement was not meant to promote Pond's itself but was intended as a tie-in for a commercial for Dove soap, another Unilever product. This commercial featured actors reminiscent of the characters from the show and ran during a commercial break of the episode's original screening. The deal between Unilever and AMC included six different spots, for six different products, running over the course of the season. Cultural references During the Christmas party, references are made to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This piece of legislation was enacted on July 2, 1964, by the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson, who would later be elected president in his own right in November that year. Reception \\"Christmas Comes But Once a Year\\" had a total of 2.473 million viewers, and a 0.8 share of adults between 18 and 49. This was a drop from the season premiere, which had a viewership of 2.918 and a 0.9 share. The second episode aired directly after the premiere of AMC's third original series (after Mad Men and Breaking Bad), Rubicon, which was the station's most-watched original series premiere ever, with two million viewers. The fourth season of Mad Men opened to universal acclaim from critics, gaining a score of 92 out of 100 on the review aggregation site Metacritic. Reviews for the second episode were positive, although somewhat more muted. James Poniewozik at Time appreciated the return of several characters that had been absent for a while, particularly Marten Weiner (Matthew Weiner's son) in the role of Glen. Moira Macdonald, writing for The Seattle Times, found it \\"not an entirely satisfying episode\\", though she enjoyed little details, such as the subtle development of the relationship between Don and Peggy. In the same vein William Bradley, writing for The Huffington Post, considered the episode good, \\"but not one of the classics, and a step back from the season premiere.\\" Bradley warned against reading too much into Don Draper's decline, reminding readers that Weiner \\"likes to toy with expectations.\\" References External links * \\"Christmas Comes But Once a Year\\" at AMC * * Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Christmas television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 4) episodes ","title":"Christmas Comes But Once a Year (Mad Men)"},{"id":"28238397","text":"One of Tower Optical's coin-operated binoculars in Utah Tower Optical Company, Inc. is a small, Norwalk, Connecticut-based company which has manufactured a binocular tower viewer used at major tourist sites in the United States and Canada since 1932.Home page, Tower Optical Company website, retrieved August 2, 2010 The company's large, silver-colored devices are used at Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building and other locations.Juliano, Michael C., \\"Tower Optical sees turnaround\\", August 1, 2010, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, retrieved August 2, 2010 Only about 35 of the viewers are manufactured each year, but several thousand are maintained by the company. Tower Optical has various arrangements with owners of the sites where the devices are located. Where the viewers are free, they are leased; at other locations, revenue is shared between the company and the site owner. Each machine can hold up to 2,000 quarters. The binocular machine has essentially kept its distinctive, tubby shape since it was first manufactured, a deliberate strategy \\"to preserve its identity\\", according to Bonnie Rising, the third-generation owner of the family business. When coin-operated, the machines can be timed for roughly 1.5 to 2.5 minutes.Web page titled \\"Binocular Viewer Specifications\\" at Tower Optical Company website, retrieved August 2, 2010 Operations A Tower Optical viewer on the observation deck of Manhattan's GE Building A foundry in Pennsylvania manufactures the parts used for Tower's viewers, about 35 of which are assembled each year in its two-story building in East Norwalk. The company maintains several thousand of the devices, sometimes removing some in the fall, rebuilding them and returning them in the spring. A typical viewer is housed in a chrome-plated, bronze-cast shell mounted on a cast iron yoke and pedestal. The inside of the machine is bronze and stainless steel. The binoculars can be raised 45 degrees up, 22 degrees down and swung entirely left or right by 360 degrees. The device and its pedestal typically stand 63 inches high and weigh 300 pounds. The company limits its distribution of the machines to the United States and Canada for easier management. As of 2004, the devices were in use in San Francisco at Vista Point at the Golden Gate Bridge and at Coit Tower. That year, the City of Sausalito, California was considering installing five of the machines on its bay waterfront as a fund-raising move. Former Mayor J. R. Roberts, a member of a citizens committee which suggested the installation, said the machines typically cost a user 50 cents, with the city collecting half of the revenue if it took on the responsibility of collecting the coins, or 30 percent if Tower arranged for collection. Each machine was expected to earn somewhere between $1,200 and $10,000 per year. The price and length of viewing time could be customized, he said. Paul Albritton, then mayor of Sausalito, said, \\"In some areas, telescopes earn a few hundred dollars a month and in other places a few thousand dollars a month.\\"Bova, Carla, \\"Sausalito plan sees revenue in coin-operated telescopes\\", July 8, 2004, Marin Independent Journal of San Rafael, California, article retrieved August 2, 2010 from NewsBank Inc. website (subscription required) History The company was founded by Towers S.

It was powered by about thirty soldier-oarsmen and an auxiliary sail. Nimble, graceful, and of shallow draft, such a vessel was used on northern rivers close to the Limes Germanicus, the Germanic border, and thus saw service on the Rhine and the Danube. The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus mentioned the navis lusoria in his writings, but not much about it could be learned until the discovery of such boats at Mainz, Germany in 1981-82. The Roman ships of Mainz In November 1981, during excavation in the course of a construction of a Hilton Hotel at Mainz, wooden remains were found and identified as parts of an old ship. Before construction resumed three months later, the site yielded remnants of five ships that were dated to the 4th century using dendrochronology. The wrecks were measured, taken apart, and, in 1992, brought to the Museum of Ancient Seafaring () of the Romano-Germanic Central Museum (R√∂misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum) for further preservation and study. Scientifically the wrecks were termed Mainz 1 through Mainz 5 and generally referred to as the Mainzer R√∂merschiffe, the Mainz Roman ships. They were identified as military vessels that belonged to the Roman flotilla in Germania, the Classis Germanica. The vessels could be classified into two types, namely small troop transports (Mainz 1, 2, 4, 5) termed and a patrol vessel (Mainz 3). The lusoria is narrower than the navis actuaria, an earlier and wider type of Roman cargo vessel. =Reconstruction= A full-sized reconstructed vessel is on display at the Museum of Ancient Seafaring, Mainz, and serves as a representative of the lusoria. For the reconstruction of this vessel specifically Mainz 1 and 5 served as templates. The replica measures while the gunwale measures . Again oak is used. The planks are thick, generally long and are carvel-built. The keel is only thick and constructed of planks; it contains a central channel to collect water. There is no keelson. The frames are placed apart corresponding to the measuring unit of a pes Drusianus. The frames hold the ship together. The mastframe contains a hole to place the mast. While the ship could be sailed, the main method of propulsion was rowing by one open row of oarsmen on each side. The gunwale displays an outside fender and is topped by a covering board. The covering board contains the support for the oars. The protective effect of the gunwales is further extended by the shields of the soldiers which were hung on the outside. Boats were steered by a double rudder aft. Sails have not survived the centuries, so their reconstruction relies on ancient depictions. A navis lusoria was crewed by the steersman, two men to handle the sail, and about 30 soldiers who manned the oars. It has been calculated that the narrow and relatively long lusoria could attain a travel speed of and a maximum speed of . The significance of the findings led to the establishment of a specific research center to study Roman ship transport at the Romano-Germanic Central Museum and of the Museum of Ancient Seafaring as its parent division. The latter museum has been in operation since 1994 and displays replicas of the lusoria and the patrol vessel as well as original artefacts. It specializes in Roman shipbuilding and ship transport, in the Germanic provinces and in the whole empire. Historical background After the establishment of the military castrum (fort) of Mogontiacum (modern Mainz) in 13-12 BC, ships of the became stationed at its harbor. Mogontiacum soon became the capital of the Roman province of Germania Superior and ships from its harbor could travel up and down the Rhine and east to the Main river. The military fleet was upgraded when the Emperor Julian increased defensive measures along the Rhine in the 4th century, and Marcellinus reported that the Emperor had 40 lusoriae that were used for his troops at Mogontiacum. At that time the border was increasingly threatened, and lusoriae became useful to ship troops to outposts or to points of crisis. Eventually however, Vandals, Suebi, and Alans moved across the Rhine and sacked Mogontiacum in or about 407. As Roman control ended, the local Roman fleet decayed and, over time, became covered with debris, mud and earth. Other reconstructions The Regina is a reconstruction of a navis lusoria by students of the Department for Ancient History of the University of Regensburg. Launched in 2004, the boat was used to test its abilities in numerous trips along the Naab and Danube. In 2006, the Regina travelled from Regensburg to Budapest covering distances of up to per day confirming that the vessel was speedy and demonstrating the great mobility the military could achieve by its use.

From the 15th century on some of its members were active in Italy, while a branch of the family migrated to Russia, where their name was russified to Trakhaniot (–¢—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–æ—Ç). They are attested until the 17th century. The origin of the family is unknown. It has been suggested that their name derives from the village of Tarchaneion in Thrace, but alternatives have also been suggested, such a derivation from Mongol targan, \\"smith\\", suggested by Gyula Moravcsik, or the Georgian origin ascribed to them by C. Cahen. No hypothesis can be conclusively proven. The family first appear with Gregory Tarchaneiotes, catepan of Italy in 998‚Äì1006. Other members of the family occupied high military posts in the course of the 11th century. In the conflict between the Anatolian military aristocracy and the Constantinopolitan civil bureaucracy, the Tarchaneiotai sided with the latter. As a result, they were distrusted by the Komnenoi after 1081 and lost in prominence in the 12th century.

As the child of a single mother who was frequently disabled, Anderson lived at various times in orphanages and foster care.Holm, Erik; and Scism, Leslie. \\"Lawyer Who Pioneered Liability Coverage for Companies Dies at 82\\", The Wall Street Journal, August 2, 2010.

Anderson, Anderson Kill & Olick, P.C. Accessed August 2, 2010. Legal career He worked his way up to partner at the law firm of Chadbourne & Parke, but left to become an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District under Robert M. Morgenthau. He started his own practice in 1969, which was ultimately known as Anderson Kill & Olick.Walsh, Mary Williams. \\"Eugene Anderson, Lawyer and Innovator, Dies at 82\\", The New York Times, August 2, 2010. Accessed August 2, 2010. Anderson represented companies that had been the targets of lawsuits by individuals claiming that they had been exposed to material like asbestos or toxic waste, who often became ill and filed claims many years after they had first come into contact with the material. Companies that tried to make claims to cover their costs found that business insurers would pass the buck. A company that had used different insurers over the years would find that firms would say that the insurer who should be responsible was either the one who insured the company when the individual was exposed, or the one that was the insurer when the person became ill, or the one who provided coverage when the person filed suit or sought coverage. Each insurer would point the finger at the other and no one company would accept responsibility. In lawsuits filed on behalf of corporations, Anderson helped establish the principle in federal appellate court of the \\"triple trigger\\", which would allow a company to be covered at any of the points where an individual was either exposed, turned ill or filed a claim. A resident of Manhattan, Anderson died at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center at age 82 on July 30, 2010, due to double pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, a son and three grandsons.

Three of a kind, (a prial), is the best hand followed by a running flush, then a run, then a flush, then a pair followed by a high card. If a hand is otherwise similar then the card is ranked by high card or high pair, then by middle card or kicker, then low card. No suits are higher valued than any other. The game is played with a standard 52 card deck. Each player starts with some number of tokens, generally 3, and the last person to lose their token wins. Each round everybody is dealt 3 cards face down, with 3 dealt into the middle face up. Starting with the player on the dealer's left and working clockwise each player must take either 1 or 3 of the centre cards and replace it with an equal number from their own hand. After playing, a player may elect to \\"Stop the Bus\\", in which case everybody else gets one turn only. After somebody has \\"Stopped the Bus\\" and everybody else has had a turn, the hands are revealed. The player or players with the weakest hand must relinquish one token, and play continues with the new dealer being the player immediately clockwise of the old dealer.

He is best known for his play Julius of Taranto (1776), that inspired Friedrich Schiller and is considered the forerunner of Schiller's quintessential Sturm und Drang work The Robbers (1781).Johann Anton Leisewitz, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Biography He went to G√∂ttingen in 1770, and became a member of the circle of poets called Der Hainbund, which included Stolberg and Voss, and contributed two poems to the G√∂ttinger Musenalmanach for 1775, both essentially dramatic and democratic in tone. In 1775, at Brunswick, and later at Berlin and Weimar, he met and soon counted among his friends Eschenburg, Moses Mendelssohn, Lessing, Nicolai, Herder, and Goethe. His single complete play, Julius of Taranto (1776), was written in Lessing's style and with much of the latter's dramatic technique. The play was a favorite of Friedrich Schiller, and was frequently acted in Germany. It also inspired Friedrich Maximilian Klinger, who was employed as playwright by Leisewitz' father-in-law Abel Seyler. Personal life His wife Sophie Seyler He married Sophie Marie Katharina Seyler (1762‚Äì1833) in Hamburg in 1781. She was the daughter of famed Swiss-born theatre director Abel Seyler and stepdaughter of actress Friederike Sophie Seyler, and grew up with her uncle J.G.R. Andreae in Hanover. Her brother was banker Ludwig Erdwin Seyler, who became by marriage a member of the Berenberg-Gossler banking dynasty.Leisewitz, Johann Anton, Neue Deutsche Biographie Leisewitz was a distant relative of his wife on the Andreae side, and had been a frequent visitor in the Andreae home, with its large library, in his youth.

The song was released for digital download on February 27, 2010 as the second single from Osment's debut extended play, All the Right Wrongs. Overall, the song was deemed unsuccessful and failed to chart in the United States, however, it made some impact on the Canadian Digital Charts. Background \\"You Are the Only One\\" was co-written by Emily Osment, along with James Maxwell Collins and Anthony Fagenson. The song was recorded by Osment while on the set of the hit Disney show, Hannah Montana. She stated during an interview that the song was finished after nearly 3 months of working on it. It is the fifth track from Osment's debut extended play, All the Right Wrongs. Originally, \\"You Are the Only One\\" was intended to be released as the lead single. However, Osment pushed for the release of \\"All the Way Up\\", and eventually her record label agreed to release it as her debut single. Reception Critical response to \\"You Are the Only One\\" was generally mixed. Andrew Leahy, of Allmusic, stated that \\"After flirting with pop and country on her early recordings, Emily Osment underwent a rock & roll makeover for her debut EP, All the Right Wrongs.\\" They also went on to state that \\"Despite some fairly catchy songs, [Osment] never quite shakes [herself] free of the Disney machine: [she] embraces Auto-Tune, emphasizes overly polished production, and generally whittles away at the sharp teeth these tunes might've otherwise had. In their review of the album, absolutepunk.net began by saying \\"You Are the Only One\\" was \\"unfortunately the next\\" and the song is most nauseating, and the lyrics are atrocious at best. They even went on to say that Osment was suffering a major identity crisis (referring to her signing with Wind-up Records instead of Hollywood Records like most Disney artist.). Paul Schultz, by The trades stated that \\"an 80s-era arrangement on \\"You Are the Only One\\" that explores the flips and flops of teenage love. It is the most impressive vocal delivery of the set, as Emily sings harmony with herself in spirited concord\\". The single did receive positive reviews as well, though. In their review of the single, sodahead.com said the song has a catchy beat and a good message. They went on to say that the song \\"is one of the slower songs on Emily‚Äôs album, but still a great listen! The guitars pick up during the chorus and definitely add something very special to the song\\". Music video =Concept= The official music video for \\"You Are the Only One\\" was directed by Aaron A. The director is known by working many artists as Nelly Furtado on the video \\"Do It\\" and the videography of the band Down with Webster and the singer Fefe Dobson. It was filmed in last January, and was released on February 26, 2010, one day before the release date of the song. The video shows Osment in various scenes at a house party, with her (seemingly) boyfriend. At one point in the video, it starts raining lightly inside the house. Guests slowly leave as the raining slowly gets harder. At the end, the raining stops and her boyfriend is the only person left in the house. He kisses her on the cheek, takes her by the hand, and they leave. As of September 27, 2012, the video has 2,493,269 views on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1pjTRmGPhs =Synopsis= The video was released on February 26, 2010, a day before the release of the single. The concept is very simple. Emily is at a party with her love interest, and she is trying to get his attention, but he keeps ignoring her and spends more time with his friends. Everytime he leaves her, it starts to pour rain inside the house, but every time they are together, the storm ends. The indoor rainstorm symbolizes that there is no hiding from the hard times. The storm will follow them inside the house. At the end of the video, however, the boy is back with Emily, and he gives her a kiss and leads her out of the house, holding her hand. Promotion Unlike Osment's previous songs (the ones recorded for soundtracks on Disney), \\"You Are the Only One\\", like \\"All the Way Up\\", didn't receive any promotion from Disney Channel, due to Osment's label being Wind-up Records, instead of Hollywood Records. Osment also performed the single on her \\"Halloween Bash\\", as well as on her Clap Your Hands Tour, along with previous single \\"All the Way Up\\". She also toured in Canada, where promoted the song. She also performed a set of songs on the local television station Orange Loung, Universal Citywalk, and at a Walmart concert. On March 25, 2010 Osment performed the single on TV show Good Day New York.

The team won the Big Ten in the next two seasons, advancing to the Final Four both times. In the 1955‚Äì56 season, which was the Fabulous Five's final season together, the Hawkeyes won 17 consecutive games and advanced to their only National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship game in school history, where they lost to the University of San Francisco, marking the end of Iowa's most successful era of basketball. O'Connor coached the Hawkeyes for the next two seasons, compiling a combined record of 21‚Äì23 before dying in a highway accident on April 22, 1958, at the age of 44. He had one daughter, Kathy, born to his wife Jane. In recent years several relatives of O'Connor were involved with the men's basketball program at Iowa. His grand-nephew, Jim O'Connor, played as a walk on from 1988‚Äì92 and three more of his great-nephews served as student managers with the team: Tom O'Connor (2009-2014), Pat O'Connor (2013-2017), and Brendan O'Connor (2015‚Äì2019).

Another 1,000 attendees came to Tokyo 2010 as observers. The theme and watchword of the consultation was \\"Making disciples of every people in our generation.\\" This watchword built on the previous two watchwords of Edinburgh 1910 and Edinburgh 1980, which were ‚Äúthe evangelization of the world in this generation‚Äù and ‚Äúa church for every people by the year 2000.‚Äù The watchword of Tokyo 2010 thus took the ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù time frame of Edinburgh 1910, and the people group emphasis of Edinburgh 1980, and added the discipling aspect of Matthew 28:19-20. Task Forces Tokyo 2010 was organized into 18 task forces, covering such areas as research, training, crisis response, technology and mission, global discipleship assessment and global mission coordination. Each task force made assessments in three areas, relative to their particular focus: What is the current need and what is being done about it? What remains to be done? and How can mission agencies help to bridge the gap between present efforts and the projected need over the next ten years? Finishing the Task A special listing called the Finishing the Task List was distributed at Tokyo 2010, which documented the existence of 632 unreached peoples over 50,000 in population without any long-term missionary engagement. Specific commitments were made by agency representatives at Tokyo 2010 to engage 171 of these in the next three years with missionary work. Delegates also signed up to send out 1,244 oral Bible teams, which will dub Bible stories for priority language groups which have a high percentage of oral-learners. Eighty-five mission agencies also volunteered to help with national surveys to identify communities without access to a local church. Historical Significance Special emphasis was given at Tokyo 2010 to the growth of the non-Western missions movement. At Edinburgh 1910 there was no representation from non-Western mission agencies.Starling, Allan. Seeds of Promise: World Consultation on Frontier Missions, Edinburgh 1980. (Pasadena: William Carey Library), 1981. At Edinburgh 1980, roughly 30 percent of the delegates were from the non-Western world.

He also did notable work in the field of commercial art and advertisements. Biography =Early life and training= Allworthy was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 19, 1892, to parents of German descent. He came from a family of artists. His grandfather and granduncles painted murals and frescoes in Catholic churches after the American Civil War. His father was a decorator and illustrator who assisted in the adorning of the walls and ceilings of the Congressional Library at Washington.Bulliert, C.J.. The Chicago Daily News, 15 February 1936. Joseph Allworthy got his initial training under his father and at the age of 14 worked as an errand-boy in the art department of RR Donnelley. He began his formal artistic studies at the Art Institute of Chicago, but never graduated and went on to study at the 'Grand Central' in New York. Like all aspiring American artists of the time, he headed to Europe, but had to leave with the outbreak of the First World War.Continente, March 1947. It was in Madrid at el Museo del Prado that Allworthy had an epiphanic experience that left an indelible mark on him as a painter ‚Äì he discovered Diego Vel√°zquez, whom he viewed as 'natural and eternal as nature itself'. After the War, Allworthy returned to Paris wanting to study under the late- Impressionist painter Jean-Paul Laurens, who was then a professor at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and Acad√©mie Julian.askart. It is uncertain how long or for that matter whether he ever studied under Laurens, as Laurens died in March 1921. Duriung his visit in 1926‚Äì27 he said \\"I was fortunate enough to study with a man who by means not revealed to me inherited the thinking that was Chardin's, Corot's and Manet's. From that time on, my work went steadily forward in goodness and quality. Today there is no one that I know of anywhere in our world who is interested in this great heritage.\\"Continente, March 1947\\". This was the Australian painter Max Meldrum, later known for his \\"tonal style\\" of painting. He studied under Meldrum and adopted his techniques and theory of art. =Career= Joseph Allworthy established himself as a prominent painter excelling in still life compositions. In 1931 a critic had this to say of him: \\"Joseph Allworthy is a young Chicago painter whose ability to paint an exquisite and flawless still life has won him great admiration. There are still life arrangements here which will add to his glamorous reputation and there are a few portraits of considerable charm...\\" Jewett, Eleanor. Chicago Daily Tribune, 26 March 1931. Like other artists of his kind, Allworthy also painted portraits. Allworthy began to progressively focus more on portraits, so much so, in 1960 a critic referred to him as \\"a distinguished portrait painter.\\" Weigle, Edith. Chicago Daily Tribune, 27 March 1960. Although he also painted landscapes he never considered it as his m√©tier, but did them as a part of his investigations into his theory of vision and painting. Allworthy's work became significant in the middle of the 20th century when decades after the Armory Show in New York introduced modern art to America, Allworthy focused on keeping the tradition of tonal, representational art alive in the mid-1900s. In an Arts Club of Chicago show in 1958, a critic noted, \\"It is a happy break for visitors who have been shown almost nothing but the most extreme nonrepresentational art in show after show of foreign painting all year in this gallery. Joseph Allworthy's portrait is done with the old time skill of a Sargent.\\"Weigle, Edith. Chicago Daily Tribune, 17 April 1958. Still life Allworthy, \\"whose paintings of still life are practically perfect,\\" Jewett, Eleanor. Chicago Daily Tribune, 9 May 1935. first gained attention of the art world in the early 1930s with his still life arrangements, and he continued to paint them even after his focus had shifted to other forms. His still life paintings are today scattered all over the U.S., Canada and Mexico in various museums and private collections. Portrait Allworthy's favorite subject was the human figureContinente, March 1947. and his heroes were the great masters of portraiture ‚Äì Vel√°zquez, Rembrandt, Corot and Henry Raeburn ‚Äì and his ultimate reputation, rests as the preeminent portrait painter of the American Midwest in the middle of the 20th century.Joseph Allworthy, 98, Midwestern Portraitist Chicago Tribune, August 18, 1991. As his skill in this genre grew and drew attention, it began to overtake his already impressive reputation as a still life painter. As a critic noted ‚Äì \\"Joseph Allworthy lives up to his reputation in a brilliant, smooth still life and surpasses it in a portrait of a model in gypsy dress.\\" Jewett, Eleanor. Chicago Daily Tribune, 2 May 1932. He was sought after to paint official portraits by prominent men and women, in the realms of education, industry and politics, in the Midwest. Portraits by him now hang in major universities, colleges and industrial houses. The subjects of Allworthy's portraits are a veritable who's who of the American Midwest of the mid-century. They included Drug manufacturer Eli Lilly (industrialist), Banker Walter J. Cummings, Boeing Chairman, William E. Boeing, the brewers Pabst brothers, the chairman of the board of trustees of the University of Chicago Laird Bell and many others associated with several universities across the United States.Chicago Tribune, 10 July 1980. He painted the official portrait of Adlai StevensonIllinois State Journal, 10 August 1951. for his 1952 presidential bid and later his sister's too.Useta, Jorge. Todo, 12 November 1953. His portrait work also extended into the international political arena, painting many diplomats and foreign leaders. But perhaps the largest collection of his portraits ‚Äì 28 of them ‚Äì is of the cattle barons of the Midwest. These are portraits of men in the livestock industry and were hung in the celebrated quarters of the Saddle and Sirloin ClubAtlanta Journal, 1 December 1953. of the Stockyards Inn until it was demolished and now hang in the rebuilt club in Louisville, Kentucky.http://www.livestockexpo.org/docs/SSClub/biosA_E.pdf Landscapes Although Allworthy, of necessity, continued to paint landscapes all through his career, he never considered it his m√©tier and he rarely exhibited them. The scores of landscapes he painted were more directed toward his studies of vision and theory of painting and they form a veritable itinerary of his worldwide travels. Commercial art A little known side of Allworthy's career, but which nonetheless had considerable significance for him, was his work as a commercial artist. He was proud of his skills in lettering, design, layout, typography and commercial paintings and was much sought after for them. He even earned a comfortable living out of it. He had accounts with General Motors, Carnation milk, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Pabst Brewing Company, Swift & Company and Florsheim Shoe. What characterized his works was that whether he painted sliced ham, a bottle of beer, a pair of shoes or a Buick sedan, he saw them as works of art ‚Äì as still life compositions.The Saturday Evening Post, 29 January 1944. Theory of vision and painting Allworthy was an artist who deeply contemplated on the nature of his art. Profoundly influenced by the great past masters Vel√°zquez and Rembrandt, and more immediately by his teacher Max Meldrum, Allworthy tried to develop further the latter's theory of vision and painting. He contended visual sensations are interpreted with the aid of one's past experience of other pictures or nature. Beauty, ugliness, order, confusion are visual properties, indisputable verities that are the same for all viewers allowing of no dispute. But because of personal likes and dislikes not all are capable of unprejudiced vision. Hence, the true recognition of these qualities is essential for a painter engaged in using them to bring about a definite objective through their employment. He termed this skill \\"detached or unprejudiced vision\\" and one painter more than anyone else embodied it for him ‚Äì Vel√°zquez. Personal life In 1916 he married Grace Geymer. The two were lifelong traveling companions. They visited most European cities and the galleries to study the old masters first hand. In 1922 they bought a townhouse in the Gold Coast in Chicago, where the couple spent the rest of their lives ‚Äì on its third floor was Joseph's studio. Grace was the subject of many portraits by Allworthy. Legacy http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/pubs/1935/AIC1935ArtofChi39thAn_comb.pdf. Allworthy never considered himself a teacher. In the summer of 1934, The American Academy of Art announced that \\"Joseph Allworthy, well known Chicago painter of portraits and still life, will teach a class in painting in their evening school. Mr. Allworthy has had a number of invitations to teach in schools throughout the country, but this is the first time he has yielded to the temptation.\\" Jewett, Eleanor. Chicago Daily Tribune, 9 September 1934. And again, in the summer of 1942, the Saugatuck Summer Art School had the privilege of him serving as the instructor in charge, announcing that \\"Joseph Allworthy is an outstanding painter! The opportunity of working with him is one not to be lightly dismissed.\\" Jewett, Eleanor. Chicago Daily Tribune, 31 May 1942. These are the only two known instances where he has imparted instruction. At the twilight of his career in the late 1970s he not only bequeathed his studio to his grand-niece and adopted daughter Dorian Allworthy, but also imparted the secrets of his art to her. The studio to this day preserves not only his memory but also his heritage, as Dorian Allworthy continues to perpetuate his legacy.

He mainly painted genre works and portraits. He was highly esteemed by his contemporaries but is little known today. Later in life, he converted to Catholicism and became a member of the Order of Friars Minor Early life and education K√ºchler was born in Copenhagen to cabinet maker Christian K√ºchler (ca. 1772‚Äì1845) and his wife Mette Cathrine Andreasdatter Terkelsen (ca. 1762‚Äì1849). His father disapproved of his ambitions to become an artist but ultimately accepted and Albert attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1816. Like the rest of his generation of Danish painters, he studied under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg (1783-1853). The German Nazarene movement and its artistic programme were also important to K√ºchler. He won the great gold medal at the Academy in 1829. Time in Rome with the Danish artists colony With the Gold Medal came a travel scholarship and in 1830 K√ºchler travelled to Rome where he settled and became a popular member of the city's thriving community of Danish artists. He is seen in several of the most well-known paintings of the period, including A gathering of Danish artists in Rome (1837) by Constantin Hansen (1804‚Äì 1880) and Danish artists in a Roman osteria (1837) by Ditlev Blunck (1798‚Äì1853). K√ºchler mainly painted the colourful everyday life of the locals. He was a particularly close friend of the poet Christian Winther (1796‚Äì1876) for whom he painted The Albanian Girl (1831), also known as The Italian Girl, a painting of Winther's local girlfriend . He also painted a portrait of Hans Christian Andersen during Andersen's first visit to Rome from 1833 to 1834. Conversion to Catholicism K√ºchler converted to Roman Catholicism in 1844. His friends were critical and surprised at his new religious attitude. In 1851, he took his religious beliefs even further when he became a Friar Minor, assuming the religious name of Peter of Copenhagen. He spent three years in Silesia before settling in the St. Bonaventure Monastery on Rome's Palatine Hill, where he spent the remainder of his life. Religious paintings The Pope gave him special permission to continue his artistic work in the monastery and gave him several assignments. From that time on, he made exclusively religious works, including altarpieces and copies of older paintings. In Denmark, his religious works can be seen in churches at Ballerup and Esb√∏nderup in northern Zealand and Toreby Church on Lolland. It has been observed that K√ºchler's early works, from the time prior to his conversion, are also rich in religious references. An example is Correggio's Death from 1834. The immediate inspiration for the painting was the tragedy Correggio (1809) by playwright Adam Oehlenschl√§ger (1779‚Äì1850) but in K√ºchler's interpretation it becomes loaded with religious significance. The composition suggests that K√ºchler was influenced by Renaissance pictures but the style and technique is representative of the Golden Age. In K√ºchler's picture, the scene from the tragedy is transformed into a version of the Passion of Christ through the use of Roman Catholic iconography; the names of the figures are in accordance with this tradition. The analysis leads to the interpretation that Kuchler's intention was to create a work of art loaded with religious significance and not just a scene from the tragedy. The painting A Roman Couple Buy a Hat for Their Little Son who is to Become an Abbate (1840) has also been interpreted in a religious fashion. Relationship to Denmark In 1877 he was awarded membership of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen and even a pension from Denmark. On several occasions, K√ºchler received visitors from Denmark while he lived at the monastery. These included members of the Royal family, fellow painters and writers. In media and culture * K√ºchler appears as a character in several novels as well as in a number of poems from the Danish Golden Age. * The contemporary Chinese artist Liu Ye has made a portrait of Hans Christian Andersen which was based on K√ºchler's Andersen portrait from 1834. * In 2004-06 K√ºchler's painting of Christian Winther's girlfriend was the object of debate in Albanian newspapers, magazines and electronic media on her ethnicity. Some believed she was in fact Albanian, possibly from one of the Albanian villages in southern Italy, others that she is from the Alban Hills of Lazio.

Background Rutherford's grandfather, father, uncles and brothers are all preachers, as well as his in- laws. He earned a Bachelor's degree in Church Growth from the Ozark Christian College in Joplin, Missouri. He went on to the Pacific Christian College (now called Hope International University) in Fullerton, California where he earned his Master's degree. He is an active convention speaker, and was Vice President of the North American Christian Convention. He has spoken for several professional sports teams, and was a featured chapel speaker for the World Series. He is married with three children and lives in Porter Ranch. Rutherford became pastor of Hillcrest Christian Church in Granada Hills in 1987. The church's congregation grew from 350 to 1,000 people by 1995, when the church was united with Baptist Shepherd of the Hills to become the present Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch. Since then the church has expanded to more than 10,000 members worshiping at 21 different venues each weekend. There are two daughter churches and four satellite campuses. Congregation Shepherd of the Hills is a nondenominational megachurch (one with at least 2,000 congregants) in the \\"Southern California Bible Belt\\". In 2008, Outreach Magazine ranked Rutherford's Shepherd of the Hills Church 92nd in size in America, with attendance of 7,400. Some criticize churches like this, calling them \\"church lite\\", but others say they help people who find the experience more accessible than traditional churches. In October 2006 the church opened its first hybrid, Westside Shepherd of the Hills Church, based at the Wadsworth Theatre on the grounds of the Veterans Administration in Brentwood, California. Rutherford travelled to the new location almost every Sunday to deliver the message. The church was planning to launch hybrids in Lancaster, California and Compton, California in 2008. In August 2009 Rutherford, who had spent the previous fall preaching about Bible prophecy, said attendance had grown from an average of 8,030 in the previous year to 9,673 in 2009, a 17% increase. Rutherford attributed the increase to a feeling of despair brought about by the economic downturn, and a need to focus on spiritual needs rather than pursuit of the dollar. Rutherford was a prominent proponent for California Proposition 8 and has claimed, for instance, that legalizing gay marriage would ultimately lead to \\"it being illegal to read some sections of the Bible\\" and that \\"the polygamists would be next.\\"The Armageddon of the Culture War Bibliography  Dudley Rutherford (2014).

Sammy and his brother, Solly, were the first two African-American brothers to play in the modern era of baseball. However, his Major League career was shortened by knee injuries. Sammy Drake, like his brother, was a switch hitter who threw right-handed. He was listed as tall and . Early life Samuel was born in Arkansas, and attended Dunbar High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, then Philander Smith College.http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/profile.asp?ID=10900 He tried out for the Kansas City Monarchs, however his brother Solly recommended Samuel to play baseball in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada where racism wasn't much of a factor, unlike the United States. Minor League career He was signed by the Cubs organization prior to the 1955 season, after impressing manager Pepper Martin in spring training. Samuel played for Macon Peaches of the South Atlantic League in 1955, batting .251 in 105 games, while leading the league in stolen bases. He and teammate Ernest Johnson were the first African- Americans to play for Macon, where Drake experienced the racism and Jim Crow laws first hand from the local hometown fans, something he later claimed as a motivation for a further career in Major Leagues. The town African-American population was supportive of the duo, but otherwise Drake nor Johnson were able to sit in the same establishments as their white teammates. Major League Baseball Samuel moved up to the Chicago Cubs organization in 1960. He played in 15 games that year, batting .067 in 16 at-bats while scoring five times primary as a pinch runner. Drake participated in another 12 games in 1961, where he was again primarily used as a pitch runner while being held hitless in five at-bats. He was drafted by the expansion New York Mets prior to the 1962 season. He played in only 25 games with the Mets, batting .192 with 10 hits and seven runs batted in in 52 at-bats, before being sent back down to the minor leagues because of recurring knee problems.

It occupies 10 acres (4 hectares) and contains over 6,500 graves. Founded in 1810, it is one of Michigan's oldest public cemeteries. Its oldest burials are veterans who served in the American Revolutionary War. Woodland Cemetery was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site on July 21, 1988. Many of Monroe's earliest settlers, politicians, and war combatants are buried at Woodland Cemetery, including some of those that were killed during the Battle of Frenchtown in 1813. The cemetery contains Monroe veterans from every major war from the American Revolutionary War to the Vietnam War. A notable burial plot belongs to the families of Monroe residents George Armstrong Custer and his wife Elizabeth Bacon Custer, although neither of those two are buried at Woodland Cemetery. His younger brother, Boston Custer, and his nephew, Henry Armstrong Reed, are buried at Woodland Cemetery after having died alongside George Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Montana Territory on June 25, 1876.

Pegon includes symbols for sounds that are not present in Modern Standard Arabic. Pegon has been studied far less than its Jawi counterpart for Malay, Acehnese and Minangkabau.van der Meij, D. (2017). Indonesian Manuscripts from the Islands of Java, Madura, Bali and Lombok (p. 6). Leiden, Netherlands: Brill. Etymology The word Pegon originated from a Javanese word p√©go, which means \\"deviate\\", due to the practice of writing the Javanese language with Arabic script, which was considered unconventional by Javanese people. History One of the earliest dated examples of the usage of Pegon may be Masa'il al-ta'lim, a work on Islamic law written in Arabic with interlinear translation and marginal commentary in Javanese. The manuscript is dated 1623 and written on dluwang, a paper made from the bark of the mulberry tree. Comparison of Jawi and Pegon The main difference between Jawi and Pegon is that the latter is almost always written with vocal signs. Since the Javanese language contains more aksara swara (vowel signs) than their Malay counterpart, vocal signs must be written to avoid confusion. Aside from Malay, Javanese language also use a similar writing system without vocal signs called Gundhul.

The prior claimed that she had been sent by God, and that she could survive without either food or drink except for \\"Aungels foode\\" (communion bread). Elizabeth had no need to descend to the chapel for her sustenance, as during Mass the bread was seen to fly up out of the prior's hands and into her mouth. Margaret Beaufort, the mother of King Henry VII, had convened a council whose task was to investigate cases like those of the Holy Maid, who had developed a cult following, and attracted visitors seeking cures and blessings. Upon investigating Elizabeth's living quarters they discovered excrement that had \\"no saintly savour\\", meat bones hidden under her bed, and perhaps most damning of all, a thin wire extending from the altar to her loft. Margaret ordered that Elizabeth was to be removed from the chapel, following which the latter confessed that she was in reality the prior's mistress.

In November 1891, they sold it James Borron who owned several plantations throughout Fiji and who leased Malolo Lailai to the Chinese family Wong Ket for 70 years to plant coconut palms and harvest copra. In the early 1960s, the island was sold to Richard \\"Dick\\" Smith, Reginald Raffe and Sir Ian MacFarlane. They parted their ways in the early 1970s to develop their own part of the island. At about this time, the airstrip was built. In 1969, Reg Raffe opened Plantation Village Resort, now Plantation Island Resort, with six rooms. In 2004 his children (Reardon Raffe, Barron Raffe, Jayson Raffe & Hannah Raffe) opened a boutique adults only resort called Lomani Island Resort. Smith started to build Musket Cove and it opened on 3 October 1975 with twelve bures. The resort's restaurant is called Dick's Place in honour of Smith who died, aged 81, in July 2012 on the island.\\"So long Smith\\" by Repeka Nasiko, Fiji Times (2 August 2012) In 2000, MacFarlane sold his parcel of the island to the other two partners and those are now used for organic farming and the continuation of the coconut plantation for the supply of the resorts.Musket Cove ‚Äì About Us Tourism The island is home to four resorts: Musket Cove Island Resort,Musket Cove Island Resort & Marina Plantation Island Resort,Plantation Island Resort Lomani Island Resort,Lomani Island Resort and the timeshare facility Malolo Lailai Lagoon Resort.Malolo Lailai Lagoon Resort Restaurants on the island are provided at Musket Cove (2), Plantation Island (3) and Lomani; Musket Cove and Plantation Island provide a convenience store, some tourist shops, excursions, water activities including diving, fishing, surfing trips to the reef, and others.

The theater is located in the historic center of Mexico City on Donceles Street 36. The former Esperanza Iris Theatre The current theater building was constructed in 1918, on the site of the prior Teatro Xicot√©ncatl. It was originally named after diva Esperanza Iris. Iris, born Mar√≠a Esperanza Bonfil, was an operetta singer from the state of Tabasco active in the early 20th century. Her career was most successful in Mexico City, Havana and Madrid, but she toured extensively in the Americas. Some of her best known works are La viuda alegre, El conde de Luxemburgo and La princesa del d√≥lar. She also acted in a number of films in the 1930s. The theatre was partially funded by Iris, from earnings from a recent tour. The architects were Capetillo Serv√≠n and Federico Mariscal who based the work on the La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy. The theatre was opened on 25 May 1918, two days after the Mexican singer returned from South America. The event was attended by President Venustiano Carranza and his cabinet. The opening work was a staging of the play La Duquesa del Bal-Tabar√≠n and Iris herself sand some of the musical numbers. After its opening, it was the most important cultural venue in the city, until the long-postponed opening of the Palacio de Bellas Artes in the 1930s. Despite the ongoing war in Mexico, Iris manage to attract a number of international stars to the theatre, including Enrico Caruso and Anna Pavlova. As the city theatre Iris lived in the foyer of the building for some time during her life and had her own private box for viewing productions in which she was not a part. However, by the time Iris died in 1962, the theater was practically abandoned. In 1976, the theater became the property of the city to use for the promotion of cultural events, changing the name to the Teatro de la Ciudad. Initial efforts to remodel the theater led to a fire caused by an electrical spark. This fire destroyed a large portion of the building, and it was completely shut down until restoration work was reinitiated in 1999. This work continued until 2002. The infrastructure was reinforced. All of the decorated elements such as columns, sculptures, facade and main stage were either replaced or extensively remodeled. In addition, technical aspects of the theatre were modernized and some acoustic problems were remedied. In 2008, the city returned the name of Esperanza Iris to the theater‚Äôs name and added a space for cabaret productions as well. Today, the theater hosts concerts and presentation by individual artists and groups from Mexico and other countries. Some of these include Pablo Milan√©s, Ballet Nacional de Cuba, Betsy Pecdanins, Lila Downs and Alberto Cortez. In May 2010, the theater‚Äôs 92nd anniversary was celebrated with Mexico‚Äôs traditional birthday song, \\"Las Ma√±anitas\\", music by the Barandela Big Band, and members of the theatrical community and the public. The celebration was also part of the Mexico‚Äôs Bicentennial celebrations.

The innovative new design isolastic frame made it smoother through the use of rubber bushes to isolate the engine and swingarm from the frame, forks, and rider. As the rubber bushes deteriorated, however, the bike became prone to fishtailing in high-speed turns. Earlier models therefore required careful maintenance and adjustment of the clearance between frame and mounts using shims. Several improvements were made in 1969.

The process is also effective at removing a variety of microorganisms and dissolved organic matter by flocculation.USBR - Lime Softening fact sheet History Lime softening was first used in 1841 to treat Thames River water. The process expanded in use as the other benefits of the process was discovered. Lime softening greatly expanded in use during the early 1900s as industrial water use expanded. Lime softening provides soft water that can, in some cases, be used more effectively for heat transfer and various other industrial uses. Chemistry As lime in the form of limewater is added to raw water, the pH is raised and the equilibrium of carbonate species in the water is shifted. Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) is changed into bicarbonate (HCO) and then carbonate (CO). This action causes calcium carbonate to precipitate due to exceeding the solubility product. Additionally, magnesium can be precipitated as magnesium hydroxide in a double displacement reaction. In the process both the calcium (and to an extent magnesium) in the raw water as well as the calcium added with the lime are precipitated. This is in contrast to ion exchange softening where sodium is exchanged for calcium and magnesium ions. In lime softening, there is a substantial reduction in total dissolved solids (TDS) whereas in ion exchange softening (sometimes referred to as zeolite softening), there is no significant change in the level of TDS. Lime softening can also be used to remove iron, manganese, radium and arsenic from water. Future uses Lime softening is now often combined with newer membrane processes to reduce waste streams. Lime softening can be applied to the concentrate (or reject stream) of membrane processes, thereby providing a stream of substantially reduced hardness (and thus TDS), that may be used in the finished stream. Also, in cases with very hard source water (often the case in Midwestern USA ethanol production plants), lime softening can be used to pre-treat the membrane feed water. Waste products Lime softening produces large volumes of a mixture of calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide in a very finely divided white precipitate which may also contain some organic matter flocculated out of the raw water. Processing or disposal of this material may be an additional cost to the process.

Together with Way≈ç and Zensh≈´y≈ç, it is one of the three most significant styles developed by Japanese Buddhism on the basis of Chinese models. Originally called , because it had nothing to do with India it was rechristened by scholar ≈åta Hirotar≈ç during the 20th century, and the new term stuck. ≈åta derived the name from Ch≈çgen's work, particularly T≈çdai-ji's Daibutsuden. Soon abandoned after its creator's death, probably because it didn't harmonize with Japanese tastes, it nonetheless influenced other building styles with its rational solutions.Nishi, Hozumi (1996:20-21) The combination of way≈ç and daibutsuy≈ç in particular became so frequent that sometimes it is classed separately by scholars under the name ., p=738 This grandiose and monumental style is the antithesis of the simple and traditional Way≈ç style. The Nandaimon at T≈çdai-ji and the Amida-d≈ç at J≈çdo-ji in Ono are its best extant examples., p=737 History The style was introduced by priest Ch≈çgen, who in 1180 directed the reconstruction of T≈çdai-ji, which had been destroyed during the Genpei war. Ch≈çgen had just come back from the last of his three travels to China and therefore chose as a basis for the work Song Dynasty architecture. He was supported in his innovative work by first sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoritomo. Of his work at the temple only three structures remain, the already mentioned Nandaimon, which remains the best Daibutsuy≈ç example, the Kaizand≈ç and the Hokked≈ç. The gate's most characteristic features are the six-tier bracket groups (toky≈ç) projecting directly out of the columns and connected to each other by ties as long as the facade. During the Edo period the temple's Main Hall, the Daibutsuden, was also rebuilt in the style, to which it would give its name. Ch≈çgen built other buildings in this style near and around Nara, of which the Amida-d≈ç at J≈çdo-ji in Ono is a good extant example. The style declined quickly after its creator's death, probably because it did not agree with Japanese tastes. Structural elements are treated as design elements, and the building's deliberate roughness is supposed to be part of its beauty, but the concept was probably too alien to Ch≈çgen's contemporaries, and was rejected. Features Nandaimon (detail). Note the exposed t≈çrihijiki The Daibutsuy≈ç style was short-lived but innovative, and many of the ideas it introduced were adopted by other styles as well. In particular, during the Muromachi period the traditional Way≈ç style was so heavily influenced that the mix of the two is sometimes called Shin-way≈ç. *Thick woodwork and imposing general look *Use of penetrating tie beams During the Heian period temples were built using only non-penetrating tie beams () made to fit around columns and pillars and nailed. The daibutsuy≈ç style, first, and the zensh≈´y≈ç style, later, replaced them with penetrating tie-beams (), which actually pierced the column, and were therefore much more effective against earthquakes.Nishi, Hozumi (1996:24-25) The nageshi was however retained as a purely decorative element. *Thick, visible structural elements with decorative function As already mentioned, many structural elements are left uncovered and have a decorative function. For example, the roof's supporting members are not covered by a ceiling and are therefore fully visible from within the temple. The Nandaimon's stabilizing bracket ties () which run the entire width of the gate are also fully visible (see photo on the right). (Other styles hide them, at least partially.) Structural elements are much thicker than in Zen buildings. *Sashihijiki The is a bracket arm inserted directly into a pillar instead of resting onto a supporting block on top of a pillar, as was normal in the preceding way≈ç style (see photo on the right). At T≈çdai-ji, both the Nandaimon and the Daibutsuden have six sashihijiki one on top of the other (mutesaki toky≈ç). (On the subject, see also the article Toky≈ç). *≈ågidaruki Another detail unique to this style are the .

Named after the Zen sect of Buddhism which brought it to Japan, it emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century. Together with Way≈ç and Daibutsuy≈ç, it is one of the three most significant styles developed by Japanese Buddhism on the basis of Chinese models. Until World War II, this style was called but, like the Daibutsuy≈ç style, it was re-christened by ≈åta Hirotar≈ç, a 20th-century scholar. Its most typical features are a more or less linear layout of the garan, paneled doors hanging from hinges, intercolumnar toky≈ç, cusped windows, tail rafters, ornaments called kibana, and decorative pent roofs.Nishi, Hozumi (1996:26‚Äì27) K≈çzan-ji's butsuden in Shimonoseki, Zenpuku-in's shaka-d≈ç in Kainan, Wakayama and Anraku-ji's pagoda in Ueda, Nagano, all dating to the Kamakura period, are considered the three most important Zensh≈´y≈ç buildings. K≈çzan-ji's butsuden (built in 1320) is the oldest extant building in the Zensh≈´y≈ç style in Japan. History A Zen cusped window At the end of the 12th century, more or less while in Nara Ch≈çgen was rebuilding T≈çdai-ji, and in the process was creating the architectural style that would later be called Daibutsuy≈ç, two monks were introducing Zen to Japan. First was Eisai, who brought the Rinzai school teachings to Kamakura.Nishi, Hozumi (1996:22-23) Having the support of sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoriie, he was able to found temples in both Kamakura and Kyoto. A little later, D≈çgen introduced the S≈çt≈ç school to Japan. Unlike Eisai, he declined the support of Kamakura's regent H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori and open his head temple, Eihei-ji, within the forests of today's Fukui prefecture. The success of the Zen sects, which were embraced by the warrior caste, meant that they were able to introduce to the country also a new architectural style, like the Daibutsuy≈ç derived from Song Dynasty architecture, but very different in spirit. After arriving in Japan the style started to evolve in response to local conditions and tastes. Among its innovations is the roof, covered in wood shingles rather than tiles, as in China. Also, Zen temple buildings have a so-called \\"hidden roof\\" structure, consisting in two roofs, the true one and a second underneath it. The second, false roof hides the first, making it possible to obtain sloping roofs and shallow eaves. The invention of the hidden roof in the 10th century allowed the inclination of the roof's underside to be completely different from that of the exterior, thus making Japanese temples feel very different from their Chinese counterparts. Characteristics A typical Zen main hall The Zen sect was very successful, and therefore often imitated. Many of its innovations were therefore widely adopted by other Buddhist schools. Zensh≈´y≈ç's characteristics are decorative pent roofs (mokoshi) and pronouncedly curved main roofs, cusped windows (kat≈çmado), earthen floors and paneled doors., p=737, p=20, p=738 Wood structures are relatively light, design light and orderly. All buildings are erected on stone podia and have either stone or earthen floors. Other important characteristics are: *More or less fixed garan composition and layout Zen's discipline is strict and its rules many and complex. As a consequence, the Zen garan has a typical elongated and bilaterally symmetrical layout where each building's shape, position, scale and use are predetermined. To the contrary, older schools like Tendai and Shingon use more irregular building dispositions which take into account terrain characteristics. The typical Zen garan, of which Kench≈ç-ji's is a good example, begins with a gate followed by another, larger one (sanmon), the main hall (the butsuden), the lecture hall (hatt≈ç), and the chief abbot's residence (h≈çj≈ç) all aligned more or less on a north to south axis, with the bath house (yokushitsu) and the s≈´tra repository (ky≈çz≈ç) to its east, and the monks' hall (sod≈ç) to its west. *Use of penetrating tie beams During the Heian period temples were built using only non-penetrating tie beams () made to fit around columns and pillars, then nailed. The daibutsuy≈ç style and the zensh≈´y≈ç style replaced them with penetrating tie-beams (), which actually pierced the column, and were therefore much more effective against earthquakes.Nishi, Hozumi (1996:24-25) The nageshi was however retained as a purely decorative element. * Toky≈ç between posts While other styles put roof-supporting brackets only above columns, Zen temples have them also between columns (see photo above). * T≈çrihijiki Each bracket step has its own , a long horizontal beam parallel to the wall and inserted into the bracket step. (See photo in the gallery.) It strengthens the structure while at the same time supporting the roof rafters. *Odaruki A toky≈ç's third step is usually supported by a so-called , a cantilever set between the second and the third step (see illustration in the gallery). The name refers to its typical shape, similar to a tail protruding from the bracket. *Kibana Another Zensh≈´y≈ç feature is the or , a nose-like decoration with a spiraling motif carved on a rafter after the last protruding bracket. (See photo in the gallery.) *Fan-shaped roof rafters Roof rafters radiate outwards from a single central point. *Paneled doors Doors called are made of separate panels and do not slide, but are fixed to the tie beams by heavy hinges called . Above the door's panels runs a transom (architectural) which admits light through curved openings. *S≈çmon and sanmon The entrance to a Zen temple is straddled by two symbolic gates, the s≈çmon and the more important sanmon. *Mokoshi Typical of the style is also the main hall (butsuden), which has just one story but seems to have two because of the presence of a roofed corridor called mokoshi. Having the width of one bay, it makes the three-bay, one-story building look like a two-storey, five-bay building. *Cusped windows Zen temples have typical bell-shaped windows called . Originally the two sides were vertical, but they acquired a slant later on. Their use is now widespread, and they can be found even at Shinto shrines and castles. *No pagoda Because of the decline in the use of pagodas, like that of other younger schools the Zen garan usually does not have a pagoda.

LOIC was initially developed by Praetox Technologies, but was later released into the public domain, and now is hosted on several open source platforms.  Use  LOIC performs a DoS attack (or when used by multiple individuals, a DDoS attack) on a target site by flooding the server with TCP, UDP, or HTTP packets with the intention of disrupting the service of a particular host. People have used LOIC to join voluntary botnets. The software inspired the creation of an independent JavaScript version called JS LOIC, as well as LOIC-derived web version called Low Orbit Web Cannon. These enable a DoS from a web browser.  Countermeasures  Security experts quoted by the BBC indicated that well- written firewall rules can filter out most traffic from DDoS attacks by LOIC, thus preventing the attacks from being fully effective. In at least one instance, filtering out all UDP and ICMP traffic blocked a LOIC attack. Because internet service providers provide less bandwidth to each of their customers in order to provide guaranteed service levels for all of their customers at once, firewall rules of this sort are more likely to be effective when implemented at a point upstream of an application server's internet uplink. In other words, it is easy to cause an ISP to drop traffic destined for a customer by sending a greater amount of traffic than is allowed on that customer's link, and any filtration that occurs on the customer side after the traffic traverses that link will not stop the service provider from dropping excess traffic destined for that customer. LOIC attacks are easily identified in system logs, and the attack can be tracked down to the IP addresses used.  Notable uses  = Project Chanology and Operation Payback = A screenshot of LOWC (Low Orbit Web Cannon) running in a web browser. LOIC was used by Anonymous (a group that spawned from the /b/ board of 4chan) during Project Chanology to attack websites from the Church of Scientology, once more to (successfully) attack the Recording Industry Association of America's website in October 2010, and it was again used by Anonymous during their Operation Payback in December 2010 to attack the websites of companies and organizations that opposed WikiLeaks. = Operation Megaupload = In retaliation for the shutdown of the file sharing service Megaupload and the arrest of four workers, members of Anonymous launched a DDoS attack upon the websites of Universal Music Group (the company responsible for the lawsuit against Megaupload), the United States Department of Justice, the United States Copyright Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the MPAA, Warner Music Group and the RIAA, as well as the HADOPI, all on the afternoon of January 19, 2012, through LOIC. In general, the attack hoped to retaliate against those who Anonymous members believed harmed their digital freedoms.  Origin of name  The LOIC application is named after the ion cannon, a fictional weapon from many sci-fi works, video games,Homeworld, Homeworld 2, Unreal Tournament 2004, Ogame, Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, StarCraft and in particular after its namesake from the Command & Conquer series. The artwork used in the application was a concept art for Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars.  Legality  While downloading and using the LOIC on one's own personal servers as a means of stress-testing is perfectly legal at least in the United States, using the program to perform a DDoS attack on other parties could be considered a felony under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. (CFAA) This charge could result in up to 20 years of imprisonment, a fine or both.

The song describes a world in which a person's dreams and plans are not as stable and certain as they seem. Nevertheless, the singer expresses optimism: \\"But I'm gonna give all that I've got to give, Cross my heart and I hope to live.\\" Ian Freebairn-Smith arranged the music on \\"Cross My Heart\\" and producer Larry Marks recalled that the orchestra had difficulty keeping pace with Ochs, who tended to slow his singing for the bridge and speed up for the verses. Both Ochs and Marks thought the song might be a hit, so A&M; released it as a single in 1967. Billboard included the single among the records it predicted would reach the Hot 100. \\"Cross My Heart\\" never reached the charts, nor was it the hit Ochs and Marks had hoped for.

The most famous Swedish punk band was Ebba Gr√∂n, followed by KSMB; other notable bands were Asta Kask, Kriminella Gitarrer, Tant Strul, Pink champagne , The Pain and G√∂teborg Sound. In the 1980s hardcore punk, k√§ngpunk and raw punk became popular in Sweden. The two perhaps most influential bands are Mob 47 and Anti Cimex, whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Some other examples of influential bands are Moderat Likvidation, Black Uniforms, Totalit√§r and Avskum. Together with the early American hardcore bands and the British band Discharge, the Swedish punk scene since the early 1990s consisted almost exclusively of \\"tribute bands\\" to the above. In the 1990s the aggressive punk scene turned more towards crust punk with bands like Driller Killer, Skitsystem, Wolfbrigade, and Disfear. The genre is in Sweden also connected with the hardcore scene that emerged in Ume√• and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as Refused (Ume√•) and Raised Fist (Lule√•) in the lead. Refused had a strong base in the genre's traditional roots and may in part represent how it sounded then, but experimented and stretched the limits sufficiently to their most famous songs rather have come under the term post-hardcore. The majority of the genre called melodic hardcore influenced later skate punk/pop punk into what it became in the 1990s. There is also a Swedish subgenre called trallpunk, with its roots in '80s melodic punkbands and raw punk bands like Asta Kask, Total Egon, Strebers, Charta 77, Puke, Rolands Gossk√∂r and S√∂tlimpa, etc. Many of these early trallpunk bands had a powerful folk music undertone and a style of music with catchy melodies, fast drum speed and narrative texts, often left- wing political lyrics, and unlike the more aggressive hardcore punk, straight to the point lyrics. Notable trallpunk bands include De lyckliga kompisarna, Strebers, Dia Psalma, Charta 77, Coca Carola, R√§serbajs, k√∂ttgrottorna, Radioaktiva R√§ker. later trallpunk bands took inspiration from American skatepunk and play a mix between the two. For example Skumdum. In the 2000s many old Swedish punk bands such as Asta Kask, Dia Psalma, Mob 47, Moderat Likvidation and De lyckliga kompisarna reunited with most of them releasing new albums with new songs. This decade many hardcore punk bands from Ume√• and northern Sweden started to play more pop-influenced punk and the early Swedish punk like Ebba Gr√∂n and KSMB, for example Invasionen with Dennis Lyxz√©n from Refused and Knugen Faller with Inge Johansson from Totalt j√§vla m√∂rker.

This extends beyond the definition of \\"the economic analysis of constitutional law\\" and is distinct from explaining the choices of economic and political agents within those rules, a subject of orthodox economics.Ludwig Van den Hauwe, 2005. \\"Constitutional Economics II,\\" The Elgar Companion to Law and Economics, pp. 223‚Äì24. Instead, constitutional economics takes into account the impacts of political economic decisions as opposed to limiting its analysis to economic relationships as functions of the dynamics of distribution of marketable goods and services. Constitutional economics was pioneered by the work of James M. Buchanan. He argued that \\"The political economist who seeks to offer normative advice, must, of necessity, concentrate on the process or structure within which political decisions are observed to be made. Existing constitutions, or structures or rules, are the subject of critical scrutiny.\\"James M. Buchanan, 1986. \\"The Constitution of Economic Policy,\\" Nobel Prize lecture. Constitutional economics has been characterized as a practical approach to apply the tools of economics to constitutional matters. For example, a major concern of every nation is the proper allocation of available national economic and financial resources. The legal solution to this problem falls within the scope of constitutional economics.Christian Kirchnez, The Principles of Subsidiary in the Treaty on European Union: A Critique from a Perspective of Constitutional Economics, 6 TUL. J.INT‚ÄôL. & COMP. L. 291, 293 (1998) Another example is to study the \\"compatibility of effective economic decisions with the existing constitutional framework and the limitations or the favorable conditions created by that framework\\".Peter Barenboim, 2001. \\"Constitutional Economics and the Bank of Russia,\\" Fordham Journal of Corporate and Financial Law, 7(1), p. 160. Origins Constitutional economics was popularized by James M. Buchanan, for which he received the 1986 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (pictured here in September 2010) The term \\"constitutional economics\\" was coined in 1982 by the U.S. economist Richard McKenzie to designate the main topic of discussion at a conference held in Washington D.C. Later, McKenzie's neologism was adopted by another American economist, James Buchanan, as a name for a new academic sub- discipline. It was Buchanan's work on this sub-discipline that brought him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his \\"development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making\\" in 1986. Constitutional economics draws substantial inspiration from the reformist attitude which is characteristic of Adam Smith‚Äôs vision, and that Buchanan‚Äôs concept can be considered the modern-day counterpart to what Smith called ‚Äúthe science of legislation.‚Äù Positive constitutional economics Within positive constitutional economics, the tools or methods are unique from normal economic tools because of the cross- disciplinary nature of the program. The main tool of positive constitutional economics is \\"comparative institutional analysis\\", with four main elements:Voigt, Stephan (1997). \\"Positive Constitutional Economics: A Survey,\\" Public Choice, 90(1/4): 11‚Äì53). # The first element examines how certain constitutional rules arose and what factors caused the rules to be developed as a result of aggregated individual inputs. # The second element looks at how rules are distinguishable between individual and collective factors, though Voigt acknowledges this research method is rarely used. # The third element is the possibilities of further constitutional (or rules) change. Any proposed change to constitutional constraints, or rules of constraints, are subject to economic scrutiny for their effects on efficiency and equity. # The fourth element of positive constitutional economics examines the economic effects of developed or modified change to rules. Normative constitutional economics  Normative constitutional economics focuses on legitimizing the state and its actions as the best means of maximum efficiency and utility, judging conditions or rules that are efficient, and discerning and studying the political systems to maximize efficiency, where the outcome of collective choices are considered \\"fair\\", \\"just\\", or \\"efficient\\". Both Buchanan and Stefan Voigt argue the foundational assumption of normative constitutional economics is that no single individual's goals or values can supersede the value of another's. Therefore, a universal, absolute social norm or goal is impossible. Buchanan viewed politics as a form of exchange, such as when individuals agree to exchange goods. He believed that if people are acting rationally in their own perceived self-interest, and if the decision is voluntary and informed, any such agreement is \\"efficient\\" and therefore normatively ought to occur. Methodological individualism leads Buchanan to the normative claim that a political theory very similar to that of John Rawls in his seminal 1971 work, A Theory of Justice, would best realize individuals' unique goals. Complete with a veil of ignorance and a priori decisions of social goals, Buchanan says political economy does not have a social engineer or moral purpose but only assists individuals in their search for rules that best serve their individual purposes. For Buchanan, the \\"good\\" society is one that furthers the interests of individuals, not some independent moral or teleological end. = James Buchanan's views on the ethics of constitutional citizenship = According to Buchanan, political efficiency, like market efficiency, occurs when all individuals in the community agree to the political structures.Buchanan, James M. (1988). \\"Contractarian Political Economy and Constitutional Interpretation,\\" The American Economic Review, 78(2): 135‚Äì39. Buchanan's argument is similar to a social contract view of government, where individuals agree to place constraints on themselves in exchange for anticipated benefits, Van den Hauwe, Ludwig (1999). \\"Constitutional Economics,\\" in The Elgar Companion to Law and Economics Second edition, edited by J. Backhaus. Edward Elgar Publishing Limited: Cheltenham, UK. Buchanan argued that just as a market transaction occurs through voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange, so with political \\"exchanges\\" of rights and authority.Buchanan, James M. (1990). \\"The Domain of Constitutional Economics,\\" Constitutional Political Economy, 1(1): 1‚Äì18. Buchanan believed that the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and \\"may be called the idealized Kantian world\\" where the individual \\"who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behaviour\\"James Buchanan, The Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty, Volume 1, Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1999, p. 314 Buchanan introduced the cross-disciplinary concepts of \\"constitutional citizenship\\" and \\"constitutional anarchy\\". According to Buchanan, \\"constitutional anarchy\\" is a modern policy that may be best described as actions undertaken without understanding or taking into account the rules that define the constitutional order. This policy is justified by references to strategic tasks formulated on the basis of competing interests regardless of their subsequent impact on political structure. At the same time Buchanan introduces the concept of \\"constitutional citizenship\\", which he designates as compliance of citizens with their constitutional rights and obligations that should be considered as a constituent part of the constitutional policy. Buchanan wrote that \\"the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship.\\"Buchanan, J. Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty. Vol. 1. Indianapolis, 1999. p. 372. Buchanan considered the term \\"constitutionality\\" in the broad sense and applied it to families, firms and public institutions, but, first of all, to the state. Crucial to understanding Buchanan's system of thought is the distinction he made between politics and policy. According to Buchanan, politics is about the rules of the game, where policy is focused on strategies that players adopt within a given set of rules. ‚ÄúQuestions about what are good rules of the game are in the domain of social philosophy, whereas questions about the strategies that players will adopt given those rules is the domain of economics, and it is the play between the rules (social philosophy) and the strategies (economics) that constitutes what Buchanan refers to as constitutional political economy‚Äù.\\"Where Economics and Philosophy Meet: Review of The Elgar Companion to Economics and Philosophy with responses from the authors\\", The Economic Journal, 116 (June), 2006 = Hayek = Buchanan is not the only contributor to normative constitutional economics. Economist Friedrich Hayek also wrote extensively on the topic of constitutional economics, even if he did not name constitutional economics specifically. Hayek defends a representative constitutional democracy as the best structure of government.Hayek, Friedrich A. (1973). Law, Legislation, and Liberty, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. Hayek's main project was the vindication of freedom and establishing criteria for a regime of freedom.Hayek, Friedrich A. (1960). The Constitution of Liberty, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. Hayek was worried by the kind of state that Buchanan/Rawls deemed normative. Hayek thought it necessary for a return to the traditional views of government, human nature, political philosophy, and economics. He believed the Buchanan/Rawls state had the almost inevitable propensity to totalitarianism as the state seeks to maximize individual utility. Economic analysis of the US Constitution The generally accepted birth of constitutional economic analysis of US Constitution was Charles Austin Beard's landmark 1913 book An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States.Beard, Charles A. (1913). An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States, New York: Macmillan Publishing Co, Inc. While most scholars today reject Beard's overall thesis, he initiated a new method of economic and political thought that would evolve into contemporary constitutional economics analysis.Voigt, Stephan (1997). Positive Constitutional Economics: A Survey, Public Choice, 90(1/4): 11‚Äì53). Beard's main thesis was that the U.S. Constitution \\"was essentially an economic document based upon the concept that the fundamental private rights of property are anterior to government and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities.\\" Writing in 1987 for the Yale Law School, Jonathan Macey synthesizes the history of constitutional economic analysis applied to the US Constitution. Macey offers a different analysis of the US Constitution and responds critically to Beard's view of the Constitution.Macey, Jonathan R. (1987). \\"Competing Economic Views of the Constitution,\\" Faculty Scholarship Series, 56(50): 50‚Äì80. As Macey understood Beard a famous and crucial part of the Constitution, separation of powers, was actually a means of allowing hegemony of resources in the hands of the rich few. Macey could not disagree more; he argues that the Constitution and separation of powers were created to hinder aggregate political and economic power. He points to Federalist No. 10, James Madison's argument of the necessity of factions due to what saw as truths of human nature. = Separation of powers = Macey demonstrates how constitutional economics can be applied to constitutions. Rather than looking at the political or philosophic intentions of the founders, Macey viewed the constitution through economic eyes, considering the incentives, choices, allocations, and other economics factors within the political rules of a constitution. Traditionally, the creation of factions has been interpreted as a political move to separate power and prevent hegemony of the state. Macey agrees but adds a caveat. He maintains a real economic incentive to factions existed which compelled the Founders to separate government. Macey argued that if government is not separated into distinct powers, the possibility of extensive rent-seeking threatens the efficiency of the government due to self- interested groups or individuals lobbying to political powers for their goals. In Macey's interpretation of Madison, the separation of powers channels lobbyists into the competitive, more efficient market by raising transaction costs so much that private market means are less expensive than appealing to the various separate powers of government. Macey the quantifies legislation on a standard supply-demand curve, where the demand is the interest groups‚Äô desire for laws and the supply is the legislation‚Äôs provision. He argues that separation of powers shifts the supply curve left, raising the price and decreasing the quantity of legislation. Legal approach Judge Richard Posner emphasized the importance of a constitution for economic development. He examines the interrelationship between a constitution and the economic growth. Posner approaches constitutional analysis mainly from the perspective of judges, who constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution, thus‚Äîde facto in common law countries‚Äîcreating the body of constitutional law. He emphasizes the importance of constitutional provisions \\"in setting broader outer bounds to the exercise of judicial discretion\\". Thus, a judge, when trying a case, is guided firstly by the spirit and letter of the constitution. The role of economics in this process is to help \\"identify the consequences of alternative interpretations\\" of the constitution. He then explains that \\"economics may provide insight into questions that bear on the proper legal interpretation\\". In the end, as Posner emphasizes, \\"the limits of an economic approach to deciding constitutional cases [are] set by the Constitution\\". In addition, he argues that \\"effective protection of basic economic rights promotes economic growth\\".Posner R., 1987. \\"The Constitution as an Economic Document,\\" George Washington Law Review, 56(1), p p. 4‚Äì38. Reprinted in J. W. Ely, ed., 1997, Main Themes in the Debate over Property Rights, pp. 186‚Äì220. Concurrently with the rise of academic research in the field of constitutional economics in the US in the 1980s, the Supreme Court of India for almost a decade had been encouraging public interest litigation on behalf of the poor and oppressed by using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the Indian Constitution. The former Chief Justice of Indonesian Constitutional Court, Jimly Asshiddiqie, also published his book \\"Konstitusi Ekonomi\\" (2010) in promoting the idea of Economic Constitution. This is a vivid example of a de facto practical application of the methodology of constitutional economics.Jeremy Cooper, Poverty and Constitutional Justice, in Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings, edited by Larry May and Jeff Brown, Wiley-Blackwell, UK, 2010. The President of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, Valery Zorkin, made a special reference to the educational role of constitutional economics: \\"In Russia, the addition of such new academic disciplines as constitutional economics to the curricula of university law and economics departments becomes critically important.\\"Valery Zorkin, Twelve Theses on Legal Reform in Russia in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform, edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007] Russian school The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early twenty-first century with the idea that constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative (especially budgetary) process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision- making. For instance, when military expenses (and the like) dwarf the budget spending on education and culture. Constitutional economics studies such issues as the proper national wealth distribution. This also includes the government spending on the judiciary, which in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the principle of checks and balances, instrumental in the separation of powers, as this creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state corruption (through budget planning and various privileges being the most dangerous), and the private corruption. The former makes it almost impossible for any business to facilitate the optimal growth and development of national market economy. In the English language, the word \\"constitution\\" possesses a whole number of meanings, encompassing not only national constitutions as such but also charters of corporations, unwritten rules of various clubs, informal groups, etc. The Russian model of constitutional economics, originally intended for transitional and developing countries, focuses entirely on the concept of constitution of a state. This model of the constitutional economics is based on the understanding that it is necessary to narrow the gap between practical enforcement of the economic, social, and political rights granted by the constitution and the annual (or midterm) economic policy, budget legislation and administrative policies conducted by the government. In 2006, the Russian Academy of Sciences officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub- discipline.Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova.\\"The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform\\", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007) Criticism Walter Block and Thomas DiLorenzo make a strong criticism of the possibility of constitutional economics as even a science. They maintain that politics cannot be equated with the market and therefore, as a study, it cannot exist.Block, Walter and Thomas J. DiLorenzo (2000). \\"Is Voluntary Government Possible? A Critique of Constitution Economics,\\" Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics 156(4): 567‚Äì82. They maintain that unlike the market, consent is not the foundation of politics, and that politics is driven by violent, historically bellicose, coercion. Therefore, they believe that the constitutional economic method only clouds the discussion of public choice and political economy. Buchanan, Voigt, Macey, and even Beard all implicitly assume that politics is the exchange of political \\"goods\\", a strong social contract view. But for Block and DiLorenzo, politics is one powerful group coercing free rides from a weaker group. From the Roman Empire to the present, they trace how the state always comes from conquest and exploitation, never consent. The Calculus of Consent, a foundational text for constitutional economics, bears much of their attack. If they are correct that no state has been or can be voluntary and that voluntary government is inherently contradictory, constitutional economics as a discipline cannot exist. William Campbell explains the weakness of constitutional economics in its assumption that the goal of a regime must be efficiency, individual liberty, and libertarian rights, not morality or super-individual good.Campbell, William (1988). ‚ÄúConstitutional Economics: Ancients vs. Moderns,‚Äù The Heritage Foundation, Speech given July 27, 1988.

It employs a variety of metres. Set in the Durham area, the poem tells of Harold's rejection of his father Witikind's acceptance of Christianity in return for church lands; of his disinheritance by the Church on his father's death and the loss of his intended bride; of his rescue by his father's spirit from pagan powers in an enchanted castle; and of his conversion and marriage to a Danish maiden who had long followed him disguised as a page. Background According to J. G. Lockhart Scott began Harold the Dauntless soon after completing The Bridal of Triermain, that is early in 1813, keeping it before him 'as a congenial plaything, to be taken up whenever the coach brought no proof-sheets to jog him as to serious matters'.J. G. Lockhart, Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart., 7 vols (Edinburgh, 1837), 4.14. Its progress was remarkably erratic. In October 1815 Scott sent Canto 2 to James Ballantyne;The Letters of Sir Walter Scott: 1787‚Äí1807, ed. H. J. C. Grierson (London, 1932), 488 (Scott to James Ballantyne, [October 1815]). on the 21st he is 'while the humour hits going on with Harold the Dauntless';Ibid., 105 (Scott to James Ballantyne, [21 October 1815]). on 2 November the first canto at least has been, or is in the course of being, printed;Ibid., 114 (Scott to Lady Louisa Stuart). and on 22 December Scott says it is nearly finished.Ibid., 145 (Scott to J. B. S. Morritt). But by 16 May 1816 it is still 'in the state of the Bear and Fiddle' (i. e. in the middle) and he is planning to resume it shortly.Ibid., 233 (Scott to Morritt). It is not till 14 November 1816 that another claim that it is nearly complete corresponded with reality:Ibid., 294 (Scott to Lady Louisa Stuart). on the 22nd Scott informs Morritt that is finishing it.Ibid., 298 . Sending a copy hot from the press on 31 January 1817 he explains to Lady Louisa Stuart: 'I once thought I should have made it something clever, but it turned vapid upon my imagination; and I finished it at last with hurry and impatience'.Ibid., 380. Editions Harold the Dauntless was published as 'by the author of The Bridal of Triermain ' on 30 January 1817 in Edinburgh by Archibald Constable, and in London by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown. The price was 7s 6d (37.5p).William B. Todd and Ann Bowden, Sir Walter Scott: A Bibliographical History (New Castle, Delaware, 1998), 428‚Äí29. It was not reprinted. A critical edition is due to appear in Volume 5 of The Edinburgh Edition of Walter Scott's Poetry published by Edinburgh University Press.Walter Scott, Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field, ed. Ainsley McIntosh (Edinburgh, 2018), [ii]. Canto summary Introduction: The poet finds a remedy for ennui in romantic and legendary narrative. Canto 1: When the pagan Count Witikind converts to Christianity in return for Durham church lands his son Harold leaves home in disgust, followed by a page Gunnar. After some years Witikind dies and the Church resumes the lands, disinheriting Harold. Canto 2: Harold demands the hand of Metelill, daughter of outlaw Wulfstane and witch Jutta who have in mind as son-in-law a rich local lord William. In a remote dell Jutta invokes the god Zernebock who advises her to foment strife between Harold and the Church. Canto 3: Gunnar expresses in song his unease about Metelill's parents, but Harold rejects his fears, planning to assert his right to his inheritance to render him a fit bridegroom. Canto 4: In Durham Cathedral Harold shows the clergy gory proof that he has killed the two barons to whom the Church distributed his inheritance. The clergy demand that he give proof of his valour by sleeping in the enchanted Castle of the Seven Shields to win a treasure hoard. Canto 5: On the way to the castle Harold hears the voice of a mysterious palmer figure warning him to copy his father's repentance when he is next tempted to violence. He attacks Metelill's bridal procession, slaying Wulfstane, but at Gunnar's behest he refrains from killing William. Canto 6: Harold and Gunnar sleep at the castle. In the morning Harold tells the page that he has been rescued from three horsemen owing allegiance to Zernebock by the palmer figure, who is Witikind doomed to wander on the earth until his son turns to grace. Gunnar, revealed to be a Danish maiden Eivir in disguise, is claimed by Odin. Harold defeats the god and rescues Eivir. He is christened on the morning of their marriage. Reception Four of the nine reviews of Harold were favourable, three neutral, and two disapproving.For a detailed consideration of the reviews of Harold see J. H. Alexander, The Reviewing of Walter Scott's Poetry: 1805‚Äí1817, Vol. 2 of Two Studies in Romantic Reviewing (Salzburg, 1976), 408‚Äí10. Comparisons with The Bridal of Triermain and with Scott's acknowledged poems reached a variety of conclusions, with Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine occupying the middle ground: 'The poetry is more equal, and has more of nature and human character; yet when duly perused and reflected on, it scarcely leaves on the mind, perhaps, so distinct and powerful an impression'.Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, 1 (April 1817), 76‚Äí78 (76).

In 2019, Pricefalls, LLC was acquired by Loblaw, Canada's largest retailer. Pricefalls acted as a sales channel for small- to medium-size businesses who wished to expose their products to a wider audience. In 2017, Pricefalls expanded with its SaaS division, PFTech, and began offering marketplace and product information management infrastructures. The company was founded in response to user frustrations with the eBay model, with pronounced emphasis on customer service and dedication to the sellers who use the site.\\"eBay Gets New Competitor\\" Fox Business.com. 2009-12-22.

Origins & History The idea of Pricefalls was first imagined in 2008 by Elliot Moskow, an economics major from Bates College, located in Lewiston, Maine. Out of a need to earn extra cash that summer, Elliot obtained confiscated jewelry from police auctions in order to sell them on the popular shopping site eBay. He started with a few rings, some of which sold to buyers with Nigerian shipping addresses. Elliot had received a fraudulent PayPal receipt from a fraudulent user, and additionally had paid fees to list his items, losing money. As a result, Elliot permanently discontinued his activity on eBay and began to think of alternative ways to sell online.\\"About Us\\" Pricefalls.com. 2010-05-05.

Retrieved 2010-08-03. Although the name \\"Pricefalls\\" refers to the descending price as the basis for the business model, recently they have expanded the platform to allow for fixed price listings as well. The Listing & Sales Process =Selling on Pricefalls= When selling an item, users proceed through a six-step process, prompting the user to: #Choose between creating a Dutch Auction or a Fixed Price Sale. #Choose a category for their listing and up to 3 subcategories. #Enter a listing title, brand name, condition, and a detailed description of the item. #Set their pricing. If the merchant chose the falling price method in step one they are prompted to enter the price ceiling (the most they think someone would be willing to pay), and price floor (the least they are willing to accept), along with a listing duration, and an optional duration that delays the falling of the price (‚ÄúCatch It Before It Falls‚Äù duration). If the merchant chose the fixed price method in step one they simply enter the fixed price that they would like to list the item for. Sellers may also upload up to seven product images, and choose extra exposure options that they would like to add to their listing. #Choose how they would like to accept payment for their items, and provide detail into applicable return policy. #Review the listing before submitting it to appear on Pricefalls. Upon submitting the listing, the auction will begin. For falling price auction listings the price will start off at the price ceiling, and drop at a constant rate until the item is purchased or until the time interval at the price floor has expired. The ‚ÄúCatch It Before It Falls‚Äù duration is before the listing duration, and marks a period of the Pricefalls sales cycle during which the item remains at the top price (price ceiling. The Catch it before it falls period allows consumers to purchase a product they really want with little competition. It also allows the merchant to experience the most profitable sale possible. =Buying on Pricefalls= Buying on Dutch Auctions Pricefalls enables consumers to purchase merchandise that has been listed using the Dutch auction by using one of two distinct methods: ‚ÄúIf it Hits‚Äù bids, or ‚ÄúCatch it Now‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf it Hits‚Äù: When bidding on Pricefalls, users can set a price that they would like to pay for an item. If the price falls to the set bid without anyone purchasing it first then the item is automatically purchased. In the case of a multiple quantity listing, the highest bids win in the order of magnitude. ‚ÄúCatch it Now‚Äù: As the product price is falling buyers may also choose to purchase an item right away. To purchase an item at its current price buyers can click the ‚ÄúCatch it Now‚Äù button to finalize the transaction and the quantity purchased is taken off the market. Subsequently, the price falls on the remaining quantity until the maximum quantity is sold or the price floor is reached. Buying on Fixed Price Listings Prices on fixed price listings remain the same throughout the auction. Buyers can simply purchase these items at their fixed price. Pricefalls Payments Payment is made directly from the consumer to the business via one of two currently available payment gateways, Authorize.net or PayPal. When a buyer views an item detail page and clicks ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, the buyer is automatically redirected to the seller ºs PayPal and is then able to submit payment. Buyers can submit payment using their own PayPal account or via credit card. The buyer receives a receipt generated from PayPal and also a confirmation from Pricefalls that the item has been successfully purchased. If a buyer has made a bid on an item and has won, the buyer can submit payment for the item by looking in the ‚ÄúWon Items‚Äù folder in ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù. The buyer is then directed to PayPal (or Authorize.net) to submit payment. In order to link buyers directly to a seller ºs payment gateway, the PayPal Id (email associated with the seller ºs PayPal account) is imputed into the payment method field upon listing. This is done in both individual listings and bulk listings. In a bulk listing, all items are placed under one payment gateway, whereas in individual listings, payment options are done on a per item basis. Stores select their ‚ÄúViable payment options‚Äù upon setup. The form of payment that a store accepts is displayed on the store page under the ‚ÄúPolicies‚Äù tab as well as in every item detail page under the ‚ÄúPayment Methods‚Äù tab. Although uncommon, in some circumstances a seller may not be able to accept payment. In some cases, Pricefalls is willing to accept payment for these companies as a dropship relationship. Fees Pricefalls derives revenues from sales commissions collected from merchants upon product sale. Commissions are designed in a sliding scale model, whereby percent-based fees decrease nominally as product prices increase. These product prices fall into three ranges, each of which is associated with a percent value fee. The final value commission is a sum of the applicable fees accumulated within each price interval.\\"Fee Structure\\" Pricefalls.com. 2010-05-05. Retrieved 2010-08-03.

It shows a Hindu pilgrim gathering at a Magha Mela at Ganga Sagar, West Bengal ‚Äì where river Ganges meets the Bay of Bengal. Magh mela, also spelled Magha mela, is an annual festival with fairs held in the month of Magha (January/February) near river banks and sacred tanks near Hindu temples. About every twelve years, Magha melas coincide with what is believed by faithful as an astrologically auspicious position of Jupiter, sun and moon, and these are called the Kumbh Mela such as the one at Allahabad (officially, Prayagraj). In the south, a notable festival is at the Mahamaham tank in Kumbhakonam; in the east, at Sagar island of West Bengal and Konark, Puri.Thousands take holy dip near Konark on Magha Mela, The Hans India (January 2019)Hindu devotees bathe in the Ganges river in India on the occasion of Makar Sankranti at the Magh Mela, Telegraph UK (2019), Quote: \\"Pilgrims walk in a serpentine queue to offer their respects at the Kapil Muni temple after taking holy dips on the occasion of Makar Sankranti at Gangasagar on Sagar Island\\" The Magha festival, along with the bathing rituals as a form of penance, is also observed by the Hindu community in Bali, Indonesia. Certain dates such as the Amavasya and the Makar Sankranti are considered particularly sacred, attracting a larger gathering. The festival is marked by a ritual dip in the waters, but it is also a celebration of community commerce with fairs, education, religious discourses by saints, dƒÅna and community meals for the monks and the poor, and entertainment spectacle. The religious basis for the Magh Mela is the belief that pilgrimage is a means for prƒÅya≈õcitta (atonement, penance) for past mistakes, the effort cleanses them of sins and that bathing in holy rivers at these festivals has a salvific value, moksha ‚Äì a means to liberation from the cycle of rebirths (samsara).Kama McLean (2009), Seeing, Being Seen, and Not Being Seen: Pilgrimage, Tourism, and Layers of Looking at the Kumbh Mela, Cross Currents, Vol. 59, Issue 3, pages 319-341 According to Diane Eck ‚Äì professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies, these festivals are \\"great cultural fairs\\" which brings people together, tying them with a shared thread of religious devotion, with an attendant bustle of commerce, trade and secular entertainment. The Magha Mela festival is mentioned in the Mahabharata and in many major Puranas. The Magh Mela is a part of the river festivals that follow the transition of Jupiter into various zodiac signs. These river festivals ‚Äì called Pushkaram (or Pushkaralu) ‚Äì rotate over the year to ghats and temples along the major rivers of India, each revered as a sacred river goddess. They include the ritual bathing as well as prayers to ancestors, religious discourses, devotional music and singing, charity, cultural programs and fairs. An annual bathing festival is also mentioned in ancient Tamil anthologies of the Sangam period. For example, nine of the surviving poems in the Paripatal collection is dedicated to river goddess Vaikai., Quote: \\"seventy poems dedicated to gods Tirumal (Visnu), Cevvel (Murukan) and the goddess, the river Vaiyai (presently known as Vaikai).\\" These poems mention bathing festivals in the Tamil month of Tai (January/February) after the month of Margazhi, a period which overlaps with the northern month of Magh. These bathing festivals are depicted as spiritually auspicious and occasions for water sports, fairs and community gathering.The festive bathing lines in the poem also allude to rebirths and merits in previous lives; Pari. 11:88‚Äì92, In Sikhism, the Magha mela ‚Äì along with Diwali and Vaisakhi ‚Äì were three festivals recognized by Guru Amar Das who urged Sikhs to gather for a community festival (1552‚Äì1574 CE). It is popularly known as Maghi, and it now marks the memory of the forty martyrs during a Muslim-Sikh war (1705 CE) during the time of the Guru Gobind Singh. The largest Maghi gathering is found in Muktsar.B.S. Marwaha (1969), Maghi fair ‚Äì Muktsar, Sikh Review, 18(186): 44‚Äì46 According to Pashaura Singh and Louis Fenech, Guru Amar Das built Goindwal Sahib as a Sikh pilgrimage site (tirath).

Plot Young \\"Lord\\" Geoffrey Braemer (Freddie Bartholomew) is supposedly an English aristocrat. In fact, he is an orphan and willing accomplice to con artists Jim Hampstead (George Zucco) and Doris Clandon (Gale Sondergaard), who took him in when his parents died in a train wreck. He conveniently faints in a jewelry store, distracting the employees and allowing Jim to steal a valuable necklace. However, an astute insurance investigator catches him. He is sent to Russell-Cotes, a mercantile marine school, one of many vocational schools run by Dr. Barnardo's home for orphaned boys, with the warning that if he does not behave himself, he will be transferred to a reformatory. The school is headed by Captain Briggs (Charles Coburn). Briggs assigns longtime \\"honor boy\\" Terry O'Mulvaney (Mickey Rooney) to take Geoff under his wing. Despite excelling in sea knowledge from his previous education, Geoff is not interested in fitting in; he only wants to return to London to be reunited with Doris and Jim, although he waits in vain for a letter from them. He antagonizes all of the other boys, with the exception of the irrepressibly cheerful Albert Baker (Terry Kilburn). When the boys are given liberty at a banquet in the town, Geoff uses the opportunity to run away. Terry tracks him down and, after a fight, takes him back to school. Unfortunately, it is very late, and Terry is caught sneaking into the dormitory. When he refuses to inform on Geoff to excuse his actions, he is stripped of his rank and, worse, loses his chance of getting one of five coveted jobs offered the boys on the luxury liner RMS Queen Mary. Geoff smugly refuses to reveal his part, angering the other boys, who \\"put the chill\\" on him, refusing to speak to him at all. The bleak isolation of not being spoken to by the other boys takes its toll on Geoff, although he doesn't want to show it. He learns several life lessons under the mentoring of kindly and wise instructor \\"Crusty\\" Jelks (Herbert Mundin). Geoff confesses his runaway attempt to Captain Briggs, knowing it could mean being sent to the reformatory, so that Terry might possibly be reinstated for the Queen Mary. He asks Captain Briggs not to tell the boys that the information clearing Terry came from him. Briggs selects Terry and Geoff to join the crew of the Queen Mary. When Doris and Jim finally manage to contact Geoff, he refuses to go back to his crooked life, and tells them he is going to sail on the Queen Mary. Since the stolen necklace is too well known in England, Jim sews it inside Geoff's coat when Geoff is not looking, and books passage aboard the Queen Mary, bound for America. The necklace is found at the school, forcing Geoff to choose between conflicting loyalties. He chooses wisely, but Doris and Jim are nowhere to be found. Geoff is taken in for questioning by the police, meaning he will miss the sea voyage. Luckily, one of his schoolmates recognizes the crooked couple on the Queen Mary, and they are arrested in time for Geoff to board the ship and join Terry.

The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created at the request of the United States‚ÄîSouth Vietnam's main sponsor‚Äîto give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Kh√°nh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Kh√°nh. At the time, Kh√°nh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal. The genesis of the removal of the HNC was a power struggle within the ruling junta. Kh√°nh, who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in September 1964 by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the Young Turks, was indebted to them and needed to satisfy their wishes to stay in power. The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts, and wanted to sideline them completely. As a result, they decided to hide their political motives by introducing a policy to compulsorily retire all general officers with more than 25 years of service. The chief of state Phan Kh·∫Øc S·ª≠u, an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule, did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the HNC, which mostly consisted of old men. The HNC recommended against the new policy, and the younger officers, led by I Corps commander General Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi and Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians. As a result of this event, Taylor summoned Kh√°nh to his office. Kh√°nh sent Thi, K·ª≥, the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy Admiral Chung T·∫•n Cang and IV Corps commander General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, and after beginning with \\"Do all of you understand English?\\", Taylor harshly berated them and threatened cuts in aid. While angered by Taylor's manner, the officers defended themselves in a restrained way. The next day Kh√°nh met Taylor and the Vietnamese leader made oblique accusations that the U.S. wanted a puppet ally; he also criticized Taylor for his manner the previous day. When Taylor told Kh√°nh he had lost confidence in his leadership, Taylor was threatened with expulsion, to which he responded with threats of total aid cuts. Later however, Kh√°nh said he would leave Vietnam along with some other generals he named, and during a phone conversation, asked Taylor to help with travel arrangements. He then asked Taylor to repeat the names of the would-be exiles for confirmation, and Taylor complied, not knowing that Kh√°nh was taping the dialogue. Kh√°nh then showed the tape to his colleagues out of context, misleading them into thinking that Taylor wanted them expelled from their own country to raise the prestige of his embattled leadership. Over the next few days, Kh√°nh embarked on a media offensive, repeatedly criticizing U.S. policy and decrying what he saw as an undue influence and infringement on Vietnamese sovereignty, explicitly condemning Taylor and declaring the nation's independence from \\"foreign manipulation\\".Karnow, pp. 398‚Äì400.Moyar (2006), pp. 344‚Äì347. Kh√°nh and the Young Turks began preparations to expel Taylor before changing their minds; however, Kh√°nh's misleading tactics had rallied the Young Turks around his fragile leadership for at least the short-term future. The Americans were forced to back down on their insistence that the HNC be restored and did not carry through on Taylor's threats to cut off aid, despite Saigon's defiance.  Background  On September 26, 1964, Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh and the senior officers in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature. This came after lobbying by American officials‚Äîled by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor‚Äîin Vietnam,Kahin, p. 233. as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy, which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government. Kh√°nh put his rival General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh‚Äîwho he had deposed in a January 1964 coup‚Äîin charge of picking the 17 members of the HNC, and Minh filled it with figures sympathetic to him. The HNC then made a resolution to recommend a political model with a powerful head of state, which would likely be Minh, given their sympathy towards him. Kh√°nh did not want his rival taking power, so he and the Americans convinced the HNC to dilute the powers of the position to make it unappealing to Minh, who was then sent on an overseas diplomatic goodwill tour to remove him from the political scene. However, Minh was back in South Vietnam after a few months and the power balance in the junta was still fragile.Moyar (2006), p. 328. The HNC, which had representatives from a wide range of social groups, selected the aging civilian politician Phan Kh·∫Øc S·ª≠u as chief of state, and Suu chose Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng as prime minister, a position that had greater power. However, Kh√°nh and the senior generals retained the real power.Moyar (2004), pp. 765‚Äì766. At the same time, a group of Catholic officers were trying to replace Kh√°nh with their co-religionist, General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, and the incumbent was under pressure.Moyar (2006), p. 334. During 1964, South Vietnam had suffered a succession of setbacks on the battlefield, in part due to disunity in the military and a focus on coup plotting.Kahin, pp. 210‚Äì270.Moyar (2006), pp. 300‚Äì350. In the meantime, both Saigon and Washington were planning a large- scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an attempt to deter communist aggression, but were waiting for stability in the south before starting the air strikes.Kahin, pp. 240‚Äì280.  Compulsory retirement policy  alt=Middle- aged man with side-parted black hair and moustache, in a black suit, white shirt and brown tie. To the left is a clean-shaven Asian man with black hair and a green military cap. Kh√°nh and a group of younger officers called the Young Turks‚Äîled by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, commander of I Corps General Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi and IV Corps commander Thi·ªáu‚Äîwanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation.Moyar (2006), p. 344. The Young Turks had quite a lot of influence over Kh√°nh, as Thi and K·ª≥ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals L√¢m VƒÉn Ph√°t and D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c.Kahin, pp. 228‚Äì232. One of the specific and unspoken aims of this proposed policy was to remove Generals Minh, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n, L√™ VƒÉn Kim and Mai H·ªØu Xu√¢n from the military. This quartet, along with T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, had been the leading members of a junta that overthrew President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám in November 1963.Jones, pp. 400‚Äì430. The generals who deposed Di·ªám did not trust Kh√°nh because of his habit of changing sides, and Kh√°nh was angered by their snubs. Kh√°nh put Don, Kim, Xuan and Dinh under arrest in Da Lat after his January coup,Shaplen, pp. 228‚Äì242. claiming they were about to make a deal with the communists, a falsehood to cover up his motive of revenge. These four thus became known as the \\"Da Lat Generals\\". Kh√°nh later released them and placed them into meaningless desk jobs with no work to do, although they were still being paid. Kh√°nh did this as he thought the Young Turks had become too powerful and he hoped to use the Da Lat Generals as a counterweight. All this time, Minh had been allowed to continue as a figurehead chief of state due to his popularity, but Kh√°nh was intent on sidelining him too.Shaplen, p. 294. The Young Turks were fully aware of Kh√°nh's motives for rehabilitating the Da Lat Generals, and wanted to marginalize them.Kahin, pp. 232‚Äì233. In public, Kh√°nh and the Young Turks claimed the Da Lat Generals and Minh, who had returned from his overseas tour, had been making plots with the Buddhist activists to regain power. Suu's signature was required to pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the HNC to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. There was speculation the HNC did this as many of them were old, and therefore did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors‚Äîsome South Vietnamese mockingly called the HNC the High National Museum. On December 19, a Saturday, the generals moved to dissolve the HNC by arresting some of its members.Moyar (2004), p. 769. The HNC had already ceased to function in any meaningful way, as only 9 of the 17 members were still occasionally attending its meetings, and few on a regular basis.  Dissolution of the High National Council  alt=Middle-aged man with greying dark hair parted slightly off-centre. He wears a green dress uniform, with suit and tie, is clean-shaven, and has four stars on his shoulder to indicate his rank. Before dawn on December 19, there were troop movements in the capital as the junta deposed the civilians. The operation was commanded by Thi‚Äîwho had travelled into Saigon from I Corps in the far north‚Äîand K·ª≥. The national police, which was under the control of the army, moved through the streets, arresting five HNC members, other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to their aims. Minh and the other aging generals were arrested and flown to Pleiku, a Central Highlands town in a Montagnard area, while other officers were simply imprisoned in Saigon. The junta's forces also arrested around 100 members of the National Salvation Council (NSC) of Le Khac Quyen; the NSC was a new party active in central Vietnam in the I Corps region and opposed to the expansion of the war. It was aligned with Thi and the Buddhist activist monk Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang, but as Thi was active in the purge, it was believed he had fallen out with Quyen. At this point, Kh√°nh had not spoken up and allowed the impression that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will, and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves. H∆∞∆°ng had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Kh√°nh. The infighting exasperated Taylor, the US Ambassador to South Vietnam and former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff,Langguth, pp. 326‚Äì327. who felt the disputes between the junta's senior officers were derailing the war effort. Only a few days earlier, General William Westmoreland‚Äîthe commander of US forces in Vietnam‚Äîhad invited him and the Vietnamese generals home to a dinner. There Taylor asked for an end to the persistent changes in leadership, and Kh√°nh and his men assured him of stability. Westmoreland warned that persistent instability would turn the American political class and public against Saigon, as they would deem it useless to support such a regime.Karnow, p. 398. Taylor initially cabled the State Department back in the US to state a \\"naked military fist\\" had \\"crumpled [the] carefully woven fabric of civilian government\\",Kahin, p. 256. and that the arrest of the civilians would be \\"immediately and understandably interpreted by all the world as another military coup, setting back all that had been accomplished\\" since the formation of the HNC and the creation of a veneer of civilian rule. He went on to say that an \\"inescapable conclusion that if a group of military officers could issue decisions abolishing one of the three fundamental organs of the governmental structure ... and carry out military arrests of civilians, that group of military officers has clearly set themselves above and beyond the structure of government in Vietnam.\\" Taylor bemoaned the fact that the generals had shown no second thoughts about ignoring US policy recommendations, particularly in disregarding his explicit advice to maintain stable civilian rule, at least at a nominal level. Taylor issued a thinly disguised threat to cut aid, releasing a public statement saying Washington might reconsider its military funding if \\"the fabric of legal government\\" was not reinstated.  Angry confrontations with Maxwell Taylor  Taylor summoned Kh√°nh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, K·ª≥, Thi·ªáu and Admiral Chung T·∫•n Cang, the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said \\"Do all of you understand English?\\" The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor \\"launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating\\". He said \\"I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words.\\" He decried the removal of the HNC as \\"totally illegal\\", and said it had \\"destroyed the government-making process\\", and that \\"I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability\\",Hammond, p. 117. something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said \\"... you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this.\\" Taylor believed the HNC to be an essential part of the government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Kh√°nh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail‚Äîwhich was being used to infiltrate communists into the south‚Äîwould be suspended. alt=Three Asian men with black hair standing from left to right.

A third man on the right has his back to the camera and is wearing a cowboy hat. All are wearing military fatigues. The four officers were taken aback by Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, K·ª≥ described Taylor as \\"the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them\\", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said \\"For the sake of their own pride, they [the Vietnamese officers] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?\\" However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said \\"Because this is one of the happiest days of my life ... Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us.\\" Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Kh√°nh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.Kahin, p. 257. Kh√°nh's quartet of delegates responded to Taylor in a circumlocutory way. They remained calm and did not resort to direct confrontation. K·ª≥ said the change was necessary, as \\"the political situation is worse than it ever was under Di·ªám\\".Moyar (2004), p. 770. K·ª≥ explained that the situation mandated the dissolution of the council, saying \\"We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have Unity.\\" He claimed some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population, and that \\"both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence\\". K·ª≥ further accused some of the HNC members of being communist sympathizers and cowards who wanted to stop the military from strengthening. He promised to explain the decision at a media conference and vowed that he and his colleagues would return to purely military roles in the near future.Moyar (2006), p. 345. Thi·ªáu added \\"I do not see how our action has hurt the H∆∞∆°ng government ... H∆∞∆°ng now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated.\\" Cang said \\"It seems ... we are being treated as though we were guilty. What we did was only for the good of the country.\\" When Taylor said the moves detracted from H∆∞∆°ng and Suu's powers, the officers disagreed and said they supported the pair in full and that H∆∞∆°ng had approved of the HNC's dissolution. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with \\"I don't know whether we will continue to support you after this ... You people have broken a lot of dishes and now we have to see how we can straighten out this mess.\\" Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying \\"the door is not closed\\". = Taylor meets H∆∞∆°ng = When Taylor met H∆∞∆°ng afterwards, he urged the prime minister to reject the dissolution of the HNC. H∆∞∆°ng said he and Suu had not been notified of the moves, but agreed to step in and take over the body's work. Taylor nevertheless asked H∆∞∆°ng to publicly condemn the coup and call on the army to release those arrested. H∆∞∆°ng also said he would be willing to reorganize his administration to meet the wishes of the military, and that retaining their support was essential in keeping a civilian government functional.Kahin, p. 258. Taylor said the US did not agree with military rule as a principle, and might reduce aid, but H∆∞∆°ng was unmoved and said the Vietnamese people \\"take a more sentimental than legalistic approach\\" and that the existence of civilian procedure and the HNC was much less pressing than the \\"moral prestige of the leaders\\". American military advisers and intelligence officers who liaised with senior junta members found they were unconcerned with any possible legal ramifications of their actions. Later, despite Taylor's pleas to keep the dissolution of the HNC secret in the hope it would be reversed, K·ª≥, Thi, Thi·ªáu and Cang called a media conference, where they maintained the HNC had been dissolved in the nation's best interests. The quartet vowed to stand firm and not renege on their decision. They also proclaimed their ongoing confidence for Suu and H∆∞∆°ng. Two days later, Kh√°nh went public in support of the Young Turks' coup against the HNC, condemning the advisory body and asserting the army's right to intervene if \\"disputes and differences create a situation favorable to the common enemies: Communism and colonialism\\". The generals announced they had formed a new body called the Armed Forces Council (AFC) to succeed the current Military Revolutionary Council,Shaplen, p. 295. and referred to the dissolution of the HNC as Decision No. 1 of the AFC. The American policymakers viewed the public moves by the Vietnamese generals as \\"throwing down the gauntlet\\" and challenging their counsel. = Taylor meets Kh√°nh = The day after the Young Turks' press conference, Taylor privately met Kh√°nh at the latter's office. He complained about the dissolution of the HNC and said it did not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon.Langguth, pp. 322‚Äì325.Moyar (2006), pp. 344‚Äì345. He added that the US could not cooperate with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Kh√°nh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Di·ªám, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Kh√°nh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Di·ªám, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the regime change.Jones, pp. 318‚Äì321. Taylor then bemoaned Kh√°nh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Kh√°nh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.Shaplen, p. 297. Kh√°nh bristled and said \\"You should keep to your place as Ambassador ... as Ambassador, it is really not appropriate for you to be dealing in this way with the commander-in-chief of the armed forces on a political matter, nor was it appropriate for you to have summoned some of my generals to the Embassy yesterday.\\" He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support.Karnow, p. 399. However, Kh√°nh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this would be good for the country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Kh√°nh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Kh√°nh then ended the meeting, saying he would think about his future. Later, Kh√°nh phoned Taylor from his office and expressed his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals, asking for the Americans to fund the travel costs. He then read Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware Kh√°nh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Kh√°nh played the tape out of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression Taylor was calling for their expulsion from their own country. Kh√°nh then asked his colleagues to participate in a campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and to give the impression the country did not need Washington's aid. A CIA informant reported the recent arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much that he had privately vowed to \\"blow up everything\\" and \\"kill Phan Kh·∫Øc S·ª≠u, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng and Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh and put an end to all this. Then we will see what happens.\\"  Public media campaign by Kh√°nh  On the morning of December 22, as part of his Order of the Day,Hammond, p. 118. a regular message to the armed forces over Radio Vietnam, Kh√°nh went back on his promise to leave the country and announced, \\"We make sacrifices for the country's independence and the Vietnamese people's liberty, but not to carry out the policy of any foreign country.\\"Moyar (2006), p. 346. He said it was \\"better to live poor but proud as free citizens of an independent country rather than in ease and shame as slaves of the foreigners and Communists.\\"Moyar (2004), p. 771. Kh√°nh pledged support for both H∆∞∆°ng and Suu's civilian rule, and condemned colonialism in a thinly veiled reference to the US. Kh√°nh explicitly denounced Taylor in an exclusive interview with Beverly Deepe published in the New York Herald Tribune on December 23, saying \\"if Taylor did not act more intelligently, Southeast Asia would be lost\\" and that the US could not expect to succeed by modelling South Vietnam on American norms. Kh√°nh said Taylor and the US would need to be \\"more practical and not have a dream of having Vietnam be an image of the United States, because the way of life and people are entirely different.\\" He added that Taylor's \\"attitude during the last 48 hours‚Äîas far as my small head is concerned‚Äîhas been beyond imagination\\". Justifying the removal of the HNC, Kh√°nh said they were \\"exploited by counter- revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland's sacred interest.\\"Shaplen, p. 296. Kh√°nh also threatened to divulge the content of his discussion with Taylor, saying \\"One day I hope to tell the Vietnamese people and the American people about this ... It is a pity because Gen. Taylor is not serving his country well.\\"Hammond, p. 119. Kh√°nh had not divulged that angry discussions had occurred in private, so Deepe was unsure what had happened between Taylor and Kh√°nh to provoke such an outburst. She contacted the US Embassy to ask what the dispute was about. At first, the Americans defended Taylor without referring to what the problem was, stating: \\"Ambassador Taylor has undertaken no activities which can be considered improper in any way ... All his activities are designed to serve the best interests of both Vietnam and the United States.\\" The State Department issued a statement later in the day in more robust terms, saying \\"Ambassador Taylor has been acting throughout with the full support of the U.S. government ... a duly constituted government exercising full power ... without improper interference ... is the essential condition for the successful prosecution of the effort to defeat the Viet Cong.\\" The following day, Secretary of State Dean Rusk said aid would have to be cut, as the programs being funded needed an effective government to be useful. Taylor later responded by calling the generals' actions an \\"improper interference\\" into the purview of civilian government. Defying Taylor earned Kh√°nh heightened approval among his junta colleagues, as the ambassador's actions were seen as an insult to the nation. On the night of December 23, Kh√°nh convinced his fellow officers to join him in lobbying H∆∞∆°ng to declare Taylor persona non grata and expel him from South Vietnam. They were confident H∆∞∆°ng could not reject them and side with a foreign power at the expense of the military that had installed him, and made preparations to meet him the next day. Kh√°nh also told H∆∞∆°ng that if Taylor was not ejected, he and the other generals would hold a media conference and release \\"detailed accounts\\" of the ambassador's confrontation with the quartet and his \\"ultimatum to General Kh√°nh\\" the day after. However, someone in the junta was a CIA informant and reported the incident, allowing American officials to individually lobby the officers to change their stance. At the same time, the Americans informed H∆∞∆°ng if Taylor was expelled, US funding would stop. The next day, the generals changed their mind and when they met H∆∞∆°ng at his office, only asked him to formally denounce Taylor's behavior in his meetings with Kh√°nh and his quartet and to \\"take appropriate measures to preserve the honor of all the Vietnamese armed forces and to keep national prestige intact\\".Moyar (2006), p. 347. On December 24, Kh√°nh issued a declaration of independence from \\"foreign manipulation\\", and condemned \\"colonialism\\", explicitly accusing Taylor of abusing his power. At the time, Kh√°nh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping to put together a peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power.Kahin, pp. 294‚Äì299. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Kh√°nh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Kh√°nh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Kh√°nh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said \\"It almost seems as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome.\\" The Chicago Tribune lampooned Kh√°nh's junta, calling it a \\"parody of a government\\" and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as \\"remittance men on the United States' payroll\\". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Di·ªám, who had resisted US advice so often. It said \\"The issue is not General Kh√°nh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state.\\" The newspaper said if the answer was yes, then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities. Angry with Deepe for airing Kh√°nh's grievances against him, Taylor invited every other US journalist in Saigon to this private briefing. Taylor gave the journalists his account of the dispute and discussions with the generals, and hoped it would be useful background information for the media, so they would understand what he had done and not reach negative conclusions about his conduct in their writing.Hammond, p. 120. Due to the sensitivity of the situation, he asked them to keep the remarks off the record.Hammond, p. 121. However, someone at the briefing informed Deepe of what Taylor had said, and she published the remarks on December 25 under the title \\"Taylor Rips Mask Off Kh√°nh\\". In this article, comments were also attributed to Taylor describing some South Vietnamese officers as borderline \\"nuts\\" and accusing many generals of staying in Saigon and allowing their junior officers to run the war as they saw fit. Deepe's article caused an uproar due to the tension between Taylor and the Vietnamese generals.  Brinks Hotel bombing  The Brinks Hotel bombing was perpetrated by the Viet Cong, who claimed responsibility, but because of Kh√°nh's angry comments, the American government was not so sure. At the same time, Westmoreland became concerned with the growing antipathy towards the US and requested the United States Pacific Command (CINCPAC): \\"In view of the current unstable political situation ... and the possibility that this situation could lead to anti-American activities of the unknown intensity, request Marine Landing Force now off Cap Varella be positioned out of sight of land off Cap St. Jacques soonest.\\" Better known as V≈©ng T√†u, Cap St. Jacques was a coastal city at the mouth of the Saigon River around 80 km southeast of the capital. Westmoreland also put American marines based at Subic Bay in the Philippines on notice. On the same day, the Viet Cong bombed the Brinks Hotel, where US officers were billeted, killing two Americans and injuring around 50 people, civilian bystanders and military personnel. As a result, there was a suspicion among a minority that Kh√°nh's junta had been behind the attack, even though the Viet Cong had claimed responsibility through a radio broadcast. When the Americans started making plans to retaliate against North Vietnam, they did not tell Kh√°nh and his junta.Moyar (2006), p. 348. Westmoreland, Taylor, and other senior US officers in Saigon and Washington urged President Lyndon Baines Johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam, Taylor predicting: \\"Some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate.\\" Johnson refused and one reason was the political instability in Saigon. Johnson reasoned the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe the Viet Cong were behind the attack, feeling they would instead blame local infighting for the violence.Steinberg, p. 91. Johnson administration officials did not conclude that the communists were responsible until four days after the attack. The State Department cabled Taylor, saying \\"In view of the overall confusion in Saigon\\", public US and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was \\"trying to shoot its way out of an internal [South Vietnamese] political crisis\\".  Fall out  As a result of the tension in late-December, the standoff remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Kh√°nh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct. John L. Throckmorton was sent to mend fences with the Vietnamese officers. The South Vietnamese eventually had their way. As the generals and H∆∞∆°ng were unwilling to reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals they had read too much into Taylor's comments and that the US had no intention of pressuring them out of power with aid cuts. Cang appeared unimpressed, while Thi·ªáu and K·ª≥ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks. Kh√°nh appeared reassured by Throckmorton's overtures and made a public statement on December 30, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thi·ªáu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any remaining tension. He also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by Deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions.Hammond, p. 122. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent so much on the country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. According to Karnow, for Kh√°nh and his officers, \\"their weakness was their strength\\". An anonymous South Vietnamese government official said \\"Our big advantage over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do.\\" The only concession the AFC made was on January 6, 1965, when they made a charade move of officially renouncing all their power to H∆∞∆°ng, who was asked to organize elections.Moyar (2006), p. 350. They also agreed to appoint a civilian body and release those arrested in December. Kh√°nh had proposed to reinstate civilian rule if a military \\"organ of control\\" was created to keep control of them, but Taylor quashed the idea. This resulted in an official announcement by H∆∞∆°ng and Kh√°nh three days later, in which the military again reiterated their commitment to civilian rule through an elected legislature and a new constitution, and that \\"all genuine patriots\\" would be \\"earnestly assembled\\" to collaborate in making a plan to defeat the communists. The Americans were not impressed with the statement, which was shown to Taylor before it was made public; the State Department dourly announced that \\"it appears to represent some improvement to the situation\\".Shaplen, p. 298. Nevertheless, Kh√°nh and Taylor were both signatories to this January 9 announcement. Although the coup was a political success for Kh√°nh, it was not enough to stabilize his leadership in the long run. During the dispute over the HNC, Kh√°nh had tried to frame the dispute in nationalistic terms against what he saw as overbearing US influence.Kahin, pp. 255‚Äì259. In the long run, this failed, as South Vietnam and the senior officers' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Kh√°nh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding.Kahin, pp. 296‚Äì297. The Americans were aware of Kh√°nh's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor felt the fear of US abandonment \\"raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking\\" Kh√°nh,Kahin, p. 297. as many were seen as beholden above all to their desire for personal advancement.Kahin, p. 296. In January and February 1965, Kh√°nh sensed he could no longer work with Taylor and the Americans, and that his support in the junta was unreliable, so he began to try to set up secret peace talks with the communists. Planning for discussions was only beginning, but this was unacceptable to the Americans and hardline anti-communists in the junta, as it meant the bombing campaign against North Vietnam would not be possible.Kahin, pp. 292‚Äì297. When Kh√°nh's plans were discovered, US-encouraged plotting intensified.Kahin, pp. 296‚Äì298. On February 19‚Äì20, a coup occurred, and after the original plot was put down by the Young Turks, they forced Kh√°nh into exile as well.Kahin, pp. 298‚Äì303. With Kh√°nh out of the way, the bombing campaign started.Kahin, pp. 303‚Äì310.

The KƒÅnvar (or KƒÅnwar/ Kavad) YƒÅtrƒÅ (Devanagari: ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§µ‡§°‡§º ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ) is an annual pilgrimage of devotees of Shiva, known as KƒÅnvarias(‡§ï‡§æ‡§µ‡§°‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ) or \\"Bhole\\" (‡§≠‡•ã‡§≤‡•á), to Hindu pilgrimage places of Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttarakhand and Sultanganj in Bihar to fetch holy waters of Ganges River. Millions of participants gather sacred water from the Ganga and carry it across hundreds of miles to dispense as offerings in their local ≈öiva shrines, or specific temples such as Pura Mahadeva and Augharnath temple in Meerut, and Kashi Vishwanath, Baidyanath, and Deoghar in Jharkhand. At its base, Kanwar refers to a genre of religious performances where participants ritually carry water from a holy source in containers suspended on either side of a pole. The pilgrimage derives its name from the contraption, called kanwar, and while the source of the water is often the Ganga, it can also be its local equivalents. The offering is dedicated to Shiva, often addressed as Bhola (Simple One) or Bhole Baba (Simple Grandfather/Father). The pilgrim, accordingly, is a bhola, and in the vocative, bhole! Although there is little mention of the Kanwar as an organized festival in canonical texts, the phenomenon surely existed in the early nineteenth century when English travelers report seeing Kanwar pilgrims at many points during their journeys in the north Indian plains. The Yatra used to be a small affair undertaken by a few saints and older devotees until the late 1980s, when it started gaining popularity. Today, the Kanwar pilgrimage to Haridwar in particular has grown to be India's largest annual religious gathering, with an estimated 12 million participants in the 2010 and 2011 events. The devotees come from the surrounding states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha and some from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Heavy security measures are undertaken by the government and the traffic on Delhi-Haridwar national highway (National Highway 58) is diverted for the period. Etymology Kanwar Yatra is named after the kƒÅnvar (‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§µ‡§°‡§º), a single pole (usually made of bamboo) with two roughly equal loads fastened or dangling from opposite ends. The kƒÅnvar is carried by balancing the middle of the pole on one or both shoulders. The Hindi word kƒÅnvar is derived from the Sanskrit kƒÅnvƒÅnrathi (‡§ï‡§æ‡§Å‡§µ‡§æ‡§Å‡§∞‡§•‡•Ä). KƒÅnvar-carrying pilgrims, called KƒÅnvariƒÅs, carry covered water-pots in kƒÅnvars slung across their shoulders. This practice of carrying Kavad as a part of religious pilgrimage, especially by devotees of Lord Shiva, is widely followed throughout India (see Kavadi). Yatra means a journey or procession. History Bhole carrying kawar Kanwar yatra is related to the churning of the ocean of milk in the Hindu Puranas. When the poison came out before Amrita and the world started burning from its heat then lord Shiva accepted to inhale poison. But, after inhaling it he started suffering from negative energy of poison. In Treta Yuga Shiva's devout follower Ravana did meditation. He brought holy water of Ganga by using kanwar and poured it on Shiva's temple in Puramahadev. Thus releasing Shiva from the negative energy of the poison.History of Kanwar Yatra: https://www.bhaktibharat.com/festival/kanwar- yatra Bol Bam Bol Bam Bol-Bam refers to pilgrimages and festivals in India and Nepal glorifying Shiva (aka Bam or Bum). The festivals run during the monsoon month Shraawan (July ‚Äî August). After taking water from the Ganges river (or other nearby river that wind up in the Ganges) the pilgrims, known as kanwariya or Shiv Bhaktas (disciples of Shiva), are mandated to travel barefooted and in saffron robes with their Kanwar (walking sticks used to hang the urns of water) for 105 km by various routes and usually in groups made of family, friends and or neighbors, and return to their own local or other more prestigious and larger Shiva Temples to pour Gangajal on Lord Shiva (Shiv Linga). On the march pilgrims continuously sprinkle any and all talk with \\"Bol Bam\\" (speak the name of Bam) and sing Bhajans (hymns) to praise his name. The Yatra Augarnath Temple, one of the principal shrines of offerings The month of Shravan is dedicated to Lord Shiva and most devotees observe a fast on Mondays during the month, as it also falls during the chaturmas period, traditionally set aside for religious pilgrimages, bathing in holy rivers and penance. During the annual Monsoon season thousands of saffron-clad pilgrims carrying water from the Ganges in Haridwar, Gangotri or Gaumukh, the glacier from where the Ganges originates and other holy places on the Ganges, like Sultanganj, the only place where the river turns north during its course, and return to their hometowns, where they later perform abhisheka (anointing) the Shivalingas at the local Shiva temples, as a gesture of thanksgiving. Kanwarias in Haridwar, 2007 While most pilgrims are men, a few women also participate in Yatra. Most travel the distance on foot, a few also travel on bicycles, motor cycles, scooters, mini trucks or jeeps. Numerous Hindu organizations and other voluntary organizations like local Kanwar Sanghs, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. setup camps along the National Highways during the Yatra, where food, shelter, medical-aid and stand to hang the Kanvads, holding the Ganges water is provided. Smaller pilgrimages are also undertaken to places like Allahabad and Varanasi. Shravani Mela is a major festival at Deoghar in Jharkhand, where thousands of saffron-clad pilgrims bringing holy water, from the Ganges at Sultanganj, covering a distance of 105 kilometres on foot and offer it to lord baidyanath (Shiva). Here till about 1960, the yatra was confined to a few saints, old devotees, and rich Marwaris of neighbouring cities, and the phenomenon has seen considerable rise in the recent years.Choudhary, p. 29 Once the pilgrims reach their hometown, the Ganges water is used to bathe the Shivalingam on the thirteenth day (Triyodashi) in Shravan month or on the Maha Shivratri day.

Early life and education Kaus was born in Vienna, Austria, as the first child of the writers Otto F. Kaus and Regina Weiner. He was already attending school in Great Britain when the rest of his family fled the Nazis in the 1930s. Immigrating to the United States in 1940, his family settled in Los Angeles, California. He graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1942 with a B.A., and then joined the U.S. Army, where he served until 1945. Following his discharge, he graduated from Loyola Law School in 1949, and was admitted to the state bar that year. He then joined the law firm of Chase, Rotchford, Downen & Drukker, where he practiced for 11 years and became a partner. Judicial and legal career In December 1961, Kaus was appointed as a judge on the Los Angeles County Superior Court by Governor Pat Brown and, on December 28, 1964, Brown elevated Kaus to the California Court of Appeal, Second District, where he served until 1981. On the appellate court, Kaus served as an Associate Justice of Division Three until December 16, 1966, and then as Presiding Justice of Division Five until July 21, 1981. In July 1981, Kaus was chosen to serve as Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court by Governor Jerry Brown, whose father had appointed Kaus to his previous post. He was confirmed with little trouble. In 1982, Kaus was on the ballot for retention by the voters, along with fellow justices Cruz Reynoso and Allen Broussard. However, the state Supreme Court had become controversial due to the growing perception by many that Brown's appointees, particularly Chief Justice Rose Bird, were liberal ideologues whose rulings were political. Although Kaus was considered the least ideological and most independent of Brown's appointees, he was reconfirmed by 57% of the voters, far less than expected, after a campaign was waged against Brown's appointees that year. After being retained, Kaus was shaken by the campaign against him and feared for the independence of the state judiciary. He later remarked, \\"You cannot forget the fact that you have a crocodile in your bathtub. You keep wondering whether you're letting yourself be influenced, and you do not know. You do not know yourself that well\\". In addition, his mother-in-law was in failing health. So in October 1985, Kaus resigned from the court. He was replaced by Edward A. Panelli. While on the bench, his notable cases include his concurring opinion in National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983), concerning the conflict between the public trust doctrine and appropriative water rights. In 1984, he wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in People v. Bledsoe that rape trauma syndrome is inadmissible as evidence of the crime.People v. Bledsoe (1984), 36 Cal.3d 236, 203 Cal.Rptr. 450; 681 P.2d 291. Retrieved August 24, 2017. After leaving the judiciary, Kaus resumed private practice, forming the law firm of Hufstedler & Kaus in 1986 (the other \\"name\\" partner was former U.S. Secretary of Education Shirley Hufstedler), where he occasionally argued cases before the state Supreme Court where he had once served. He also mentored then- associate Jeffrey Ehrlich, who would later rise to national prominence for arguing cases in the United States and California Supreme Court. Personal life On January 12, 1943, he married Alice Jane Berta Huttenbach, known as Peggy Alice Kaus (February 8, 1923 - July 5, 2011), in Hyannis, Massachusetts, and they had two sons: Stephen and \\"Mickey\\". Kaus retired from the practice of law in 1995, as he was diagnosed with lung cancer. On January 11, 1996, he died in Beverly Hills, California. His wife and son, Mickey, were at his side.

Their aim was to install General Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m, a Kh√°nh rival who had been sent to Washington D.C. as Ambassador to the United States to prevent him from seizing power. The attempted coup reached a stalemate, and although the trio did not take power, a group of officers led by General Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi and Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, and hostile to both the plot and to Kh√°nh himself, were able to force a leadership change and take control themselves with the support of American officials, who had lost confidence in Kh√°nh. Although Kh√°nh had seized power in January 1964 in alliance with Khi√™m, the pair had soon fallen out over policy disputes along religious lines, and the Catholic Khi√™m began to plot against Kh√°nh. Khi√™m was believed to have helped plan a failed coup in September 1964, and Kh√°nh exiled him as a result. While in Washington, Khi√™m continued to plot alongside his aide Th·∫£o, who was actually a communist agent bent on trying to foment infighting at every opportunity. Aware of Th·∫£o's plans, Kh√°nh summoned him back to Vietnam in an apparent attempt to capture him, and Th·∫£o responded by going into hiding and preparing for his attack. In the meantime, Kh√°nh's hold on power was slipping as his military support dwindled, and he became increasingly reliant on the support of civilian Buddhist activists who favored negotiations with the communists and opposed escalation of the Vietnam War. The Americans‚Äîmost notably Ambassador Maxwell Taylor‚Äîwere opposed to this and had been lobbying various senior Vietnamese officers such as K·ª≥ to overthrow Kh√°nh, who knew that American-sponsored moves to depose him were afoot. However, the Americans were not counting on Th·∫£o and his fellow Catholic Ph√°t trying to seize power on an explicitly religious platform, claiming fidelity to slain former Catholic President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám and promising to recall Khi√™m from the US to lead the new regime. This caused alarm among the Buddhist majority, who had campaigned heavily against Di·ªám's discriminatory religious policies in the months leading up to his ouster in November 1963. Although they wanted Kh√°nh gone, the Americans did not want Th·∫£o and Ph√°t to succeed, so they sought out K·ª≥ and Thi in an attempt to have them defeat the original coup and then depose Kh√°nh. During the initial attack, Th·∫£o and Ph√°t tried to capture both Kh√°nh and K·ª≥, but both men escaped narrowly, although some of their colleagues in the Armed Forces Council were arrested. Although the rebels were able to take control of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the military headquarters of South Vietnam, K·ª≥ was able to regroup quickly and retain control of the nearby Bien Hoa Air Base, using it to mobilize air power and stop the rebel advance with threats of bombing. Late in the night, Th·∫£o and Ph√°t met K·ª≥ in a meeting arranged by the Americans, where an agreement was reached for the coup to be ended in return for Kh√°nh's ouster. By early next morning, the bloodless military action was over as Th·∫£o and Ph√°t went into hiding, and the junta voted to sack their leader Kh√°nh, who was absent on a military inspection tour, thinking that K·ª≥ and Thi were on his side. When Kh√°nh heard of his ouster, he declared it to be illegal. After defying his colleagues and travelling around the country for a day in a fruitless attempt to rally support for a comeback, Kh√°nh went into exile after being named to fill the meaningless post of Ambassador-at-Large and allowed an elaborate ceremonial military send-off to save face. Ph√°t and Th·∫£o were later sentenced to death in absentia. Th·∫£o was hunted down and killed in July 1965, while Ph√°t remained on the run for several years before turning himself in and being pardoned.  Background  General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh had come to power in January 1964 after surprising the ruling junta of General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh in a bloodless coup. However, due to American pressure, he kept the popular Minh as a token head of state, while concentrating real power in his hands by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council.Shaplen, pp. 228-240. In August, the Vietnam War continued to escalate following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a disputed encounter between communist and American naval vessels off the North Vietnamese coast; Washington accused North Vietnam of attacking their ships in international waters.Moyar (2004), p. 757.Moyar (2006), pp. 310-311.Moyar (2006), p. 311. Kh√°nh saw the tense situation as an opportunity to increase his authority. On August 7, he declared a state of emergency, increased police powers, banned protests, tightened censorship and allowed the police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. He drafted a new constitution,McAllister, p. 762. which would have augmented his personal power at the expense of the already-limited Minh. However, these moves only served to weaken Kh√°nh as large demonstrations and riots broke out in the cities, with majority Buddhists prominent, calling for an end to the state of emergency and the abandonment of the new constitution, as well as a progression back to civilian rule. Fearing he could be toppled by the intensifying protests, Kh√°nh made concessions,Moyar (2004), p. 761. repealing the new constitution and police measures, and promising to reinstate civilian rule and remove C·∫ßn Lao Party‚Äîa secret Catholic organization used to infiltrate and spy on society to maintain President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám's regime‚Äîmembers from power. General Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m later claimed \\"Kh√°nh felt there was no choice but to accept since the influence of Tr√≠ Quang was so great that he could not only turn the majority of the people against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces\\".McAllister, p. 763.Moyar (2004), p. 762. Many senior officers, particularly the Catholic Generals Khi√™m and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, decried what they viewed as a handing of power to the Buddhist leaders.Moyar (2004), pp. 762-763. They tried to replace Kh√°nh with Minh, but abandoned their coup plans after failing to get an endorsement from the Americans.Moyar (2004), p. 763. Kh√°nh blamed the government instability on troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc d√¢n ƒë·∫£ng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam, usually known simply as the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát), who he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát included Thi·ªáu and Khi√™m.Kahin, pp. 228-230. For his part, Khi√™m blamed Kh√°nh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses against the communists.Moyar (2006), p. 318. In September, the Catholic Generals L√¢m VƒÉn Ph√°t and D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c launched a coup after being demoted by Kh√°nh in response to Buddhist pressure; Ph√°t was a well-known Di·ªám loyalist. They were supported by the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, Khi√™m and Colonel Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc Th·∫£o. While Th·∫£o was also a Catholic, he was an undetected communist spy who tried to foment infighting at every opportunity. The coup failed and Kh√°nh exiled Khi√™m to Washington as ambassador, and his close friend Th·∫£o was sent along as press attache.Kahin, pp. 228-232. Concerned that Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ and General Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi‚Äîwho had put down the coup attempt for him‚Äîhad become too powerful, Kh√°nh had Ph√°t and Duc acquitted in their military trial in an effort to use them as a political counterweight. However, the coup was seen as the start of Kh√°nh's ultimate political decline. Due to the intervention of K·ª≥ and Thi, Kh√°nh was now indebted to them. In an attempt to maintain his political power in the face of increasing opposition from within the junta, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the war. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Kh√°nh became increasingly strained.Kahin, pp. 232-235.  American encouragement of a coup  alt=Middle-aged man with greying dark hair parted slightly off-centre. He wears a green dress uniform, with suit and tie, is clean-shaven, and has four stars on his shoulder to indicate his rank. By 1965, the Americans were looking for someone to overthrow Kh√°nh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Kh√°nh since the start of the year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Kh√°nh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims.Kahin, pp. 292-296. Furthermore, Taylor and Kh√°nh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Kh√°nh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Kh√°nh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Kh√°nh resign the leadership. Kh√°nh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador.Kahin, pp. 255-259. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.Karnow, p. 399. In January 1965, the junta-appointed Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng intensified the anti- communist war effort by expanding military expenditure using aid money and equipment from the Americans, and increasing the size of the armed forces by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti-H∆∞∆°ng demonstrations and riots across the country, mainly from conscription-aged students and Buddhists who wanted negotiations.Kahin, pp. 267-269. Reliant on Buddhist support, Kh√°nh did little to try to contain the protests.Moyar (2004), pp. 774-775. Kh√°nh then decided to have the armed forces take over the government. On January 27, with the support of Thi and K·ª≥, Kh√°nh removed H∆∞∆°ng in a bloodless putsch. He promised to leave politics once the situation was stabilized and hand over power to a civilian body. It was believed some of the officers supported Kh√°nh's increased power to give him an opportunity to fail and be removed permanently.Moyar (2006), p. 775. Kh√°nh persisted with the facade of civilian government by retaining figurehead chief of state Phan Kh·∫Øc S·ª≠u and making economics professor Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n O√°nh the caretaker prime minister.Karnow, p. 400.Kahin, p. 293. Kh√°nh's deposal of the prime minister nullified a counter-plot involving H∆∞∆°ng, which had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, H∆∞∆°ng had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers, reported to include Generals Thi·ªáu and Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥. They planned to remove Kh√°nh and bring Khi√™m back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to give full support. They regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khi√™m, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for H∆∞∆°ng if the plot failed.Kahin, p. 297. Kh√°nh's deposal of H∆∞∆°ng further heightened American opposition to him and fears that his reliance on Buddhist support would result in his not taking a hardline position against the communists.Kahin, pp. 294-295. Aware of declining US support, Kh√°nh tried to initiate peace negotiations with the Viet Cong, but he only managed an exchange of letters and was yet to organize any meetings or negotiations before he was overthrown. In the meantime, this only intensified US efforts to engineer a coup, and many of Kh√°nh's colleagues‚Äîmostly Catholic Dai Viet supporters‚Äîhad by then privately concluded that he was set to pursue a deal with the communists.Kahin, p. 295. Many of these felt that Kh√°nh saw himself as the \\"Sihanouk of Vietnam\\"; the Cambodian monarch had managed to avoid the Cold War for the time being by shunning both communist and anti-communist blocs. During the first half of February, suspicions and evidence against Kh√°nh began to solidify, an example being his order to release the wife of communist leader Huynh Tan Ph√°t from jail. Taylor's superiors in Washington began to align with his view, giving him more scope to agitate for a coup.Kahin, p. 511.Kahin, p. 296. During the dispute with Taylor over the High National Council in December, Kh√°nh had tried to frame the dispute in nationalist terms, in an attempt to rally support around himself against what he saw as overbearing US influence. This worked for a while, as Taylor had angrily berated Kh√°nh's generals, but in the long run it failed, as South Vietnam and the generals' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Kh√°nh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding.Kahin, pp. 296-297. On occasions during the December stand-off, Kh√°nh had appealed to his colleagues to support the expulsion of Taylor from the country. The ambassador said that US support for South Vietnam would end if he was expelled, and the generals backed down, but Kh√°nh said the military did not need US aid. The Americans were aware of Kh√°nh's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor credited the fear of US abandonment for having \\"raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking him\\", as many were seen as beholden to their desire for personal advancement above all. In the first week of February, Taylor told K·ª≥‚Äîwho then passed on the message to colleagues in the junta‚Äîthat the US was \\"in no way propping up General Kh√°nh or backing him in any fashion\\". Taylor thought his message had been effective and sent a cable to Washington claiming his words had \\"fallen on fertile ground\\". He then had the message repeated to seven other key generals. At this stage, Taylor and his staff in Saigon thought highly of three officers as possible replacements for Kh√°nh: Thi·ªáu, the commander of II Corps C√≥, and the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy Admiral Chung T·∫•n Cang. A US Defense Department report described C√≥ as an \\"outstanding officer ... friendly to Americans\\" and deemed Cang \\"a good leader ... anti-communist; friendly towards U.S\\".Kahin, p. 512. Thi·ªáu was quoted in a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report as being described by an unnamed American official as \\"intelligent, highly ambitious, and likely to remain a coup plotter with the aim of personal advancement\\". At the same time, the CIA was aware that C√≥ had become disillusioned with Kh√°nh and had stopped attending junta meetings after Kh√°nh accused him of \\"having been bought off by the Americans\\". Taylor also did not rule out supporting a return to power for Khi√™m, despite having agreed with Kh√°nh's decision to exile him after the September 1964 coup.Kahin, p. 232. Taylor cabled Washington to say \\"I can well visualize [the] necessity at some time of using full U.S. leverage ... to induce our Vietnamese friends to get Kh√°nh out of [the] position of commander-in-chief (from which he pulls the strings) and to install their very best governmental line-up.\\" He also told his State Department superiors that Kh√°nh was very likely aware of his machinations, but that he did not care about this. At the same time, there was also the question of finding another military-appointed prime minister to replace H∆∞∆°ng.Kahin, p. 298. Taylor wanted Nguyen Luu Vien, Huong's deputy, to take over, and advised South Vietnamese officers who were on good terms with him to try to engineer this, but they were not able to get enough support. Eventually, Phan Huy Qu√°t was appointed prime minister on February 14.Moyar (2006), p. 363. Qu√°t was a moderate Buddhist not associated with the political demonstrators, and seen as a compromise candidate who would be acceptable across the religious spectrum, albeit grudgingly. He was also regarded as being favorable to Kh√°nh, who would not be around for more than a few more days to support, control or pressure him in any case.Kahin, pp. 298-299. All the while, intelligence reports of Kh√°nh's attempted dealings with the communists increased.  Preliminary plots  alt=Three Asian men with black hair standing from left to right.

Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese officers to remove Kh√°nh were not a secret, and it had an unwanted side- effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of K·ª≥, Thi·ªáu, C√≥ and Cang were not yet ready to stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Th·∫£o, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General L√™ Nguy√™n Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Kh√°nh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects.Kahin, p. 513. Khang was aware Th·∫£o was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Th·∫£o, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come. At the time, the Vietnamese military was highly factionalized in complicated and unusual ways, and it was not clear where the sympathies of the respective officers lied. Thi was pro-Buddhist, but he and K·ª≥ had been suspected of mooting a coup attempt against Kh√°nh in September 1964,Kahin, p. 498. and he had also been reported by the CIA in December 1964 as having vowed to kill Kh√°nh. Although K·ª≥ had made comments hinting threats to Kh√°nh, he was also known to be strongly opposed to nominally hardline Catholic Di·ªám supporters‚Äîsuch as Th·∫£o‚Äîwho were currently the frontrunners to launch the coup.Kahin, pp. 301, 513. Meanwhile, the likes of Thi·ªáu, C√≥ and Cang, whom the Americans favored, and were Catholic-aligned in more moderate ways, were cautious in comparison to the flamboyant and impetuous K·ª≥ and Thi.Kahin, p. 257.Karnow, pp. 396-397, 460.Moyar (2006), p. 407. They maintained a guarded approach, waiting to see what the other officers would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative. For his part, K·ª≥ was reported by US intelligence to have privately predicted that Kh√°nh would be ousted in an efficient manner without bloodletting and replaced by Thi·ªáu. Plot by Ph√°t and Th·∫£o  In late December 1964, Th·∫£o was summoned back to Saigon by Kh√°nh, who correctly suspected him and Khi√™m of plotting together in Washington. Th·∫£o believed Kh√°nh was attempting to have him killed,Tucker, p. 325.Tang, pp. 56-57. so he went underground upon returning to Saigon, and began plotting in earnest,Tang, p. 57. unfazed by the prospect of being charged for desertion.Shaplen, pp. 308-309. The ruling junta appealed to Th·∫£o in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them. Due to his Catholicism, Th·∫£o was able to recruit Di·ªám loyalists such as Ph√°t.VanDeMark, p. 80. In mid-January 1965, the regime called for him to report to his superiors in the ARVN, warning that he would be \\"considered guilty of abandoning his post with all the consequences of such a situation\\" if he failed to do so. At this time, it was still not known that Th·∫£o was a communist agent who was deliberately trying to cause infighting within South Vietnam at every opportunity. With Kh√°nh's hold on power shaky, an anonymous source said Th·∫£o was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: \\"Th·∫£o acted first, out of fear that if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Kh√°nh and get rid of him as well. He knew that if the others overthrew Kh√°nh his fate would be worse than Kh√°nh's.\\"Kahin, p. 299. During this time, Th·∫£o kept in touch with elements of the CIA in an attempt to get American backing. Between January and February, Th·∫£o finalized his own coup plans. Th·∫£o consulted K·ª≥--who wanted to seize power for himself--and exhorted him to join the coup, but the air force chief claimed he was remaining neutral. Th·∫£o thus mistakenly thought K·ª≥ would not intervene against him.VanDeMark, p. 81. K·ª≥ had actually been preparing his own coup plans for a fortnight and was strongly opposed to the likes of Th·∫£o and Ph√°t.  Coup beginning  Shortly before noon on 19 February, Th·∫£o and Ph√°t attacked, using around 50 tanks and a mixture of infantry battalions to seize control of the post office and radio station in Saigon, cutting off communication lines. The tanks were led by Colonel D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a, a Catholic member of the Dai Viet. He surrounded the home of General Kh√°nh, and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state S·ª≠u. When he was spotted by the press, Ph√°t emerged from a tank to quip \\"This operation is to expel Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh from the government\\". Th·∫£o said he was going to bring back Khi√™m from Washington to head the new regime. In doing so, he caught Khi√™m‚Äîat least nominally‚Äîoff guard, asleep in his Maryland home. When informed of what was happening, Khi√™m sent a cable pledging \\"total support\\" to the plot. Rebel forces also surrounded the headquarters of the Republic of Vietnam Navy located on the Saigon River, apparently in an attempt to capture Cang. However this was unsuccessful, and Cang moved the fleet to Nh√† B√®‚Äîa port downstream on the Saigon River‚Äîto prevent the rebels from seizing the boats. alt=Black-and- white photo of a runway and hangars. Only one large airplane can be seen. In the meantime, Th·∫£o's main partner Ph√°t headed towards Tan Son Nhut Air Base ‚Äì the country's military headquarters ‚Äì to capture it with an assortment of marines, paratroopers and special forces troops. At the time, most of the senior officers had been in meetings with American officials at Tan Son Nhut since the start of the morning, and Kh√°nh left at 12:30. The plotters had secured the cooperation of someone working inside the Joint General Staff headquarters. This collaborator was supposed to have closed the gate so Kh√°nh would be held up, but left them open.Kahin, p. 514. Some of the other senior officers in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and were caught by Ph√°t's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings in the complex remained under junta control. Kh√°nh had been scheduled to meet with Qu√°t and his cabinet in a building at Tan Son Nhut. It was the new ministry's first meeting, and Taylor and General William Westmoreland, the commander of US forces in Vietnam, were present. Due to the poor relations, Kh√°nh was sure they were plotting against him. He thus suspected their insistence on his attending Qu√°t's first cabinet meeting to be part of a trap, and decided to excuse himself partway through the meeting to go \\"on tour\\", at which point he saw troops massing around the perimeter of the air field.Kahin, p. 300. Kh√°nh managed to escape to V≈©ng T√†u after his plane had just managed to emerge from the hangar and lift off as rebel tanks rolled in to block the runway and shut down the airport.Tang, p. 363. The ground troops also missed capturing K·ª≥, who fled through the Saigon streets in a sports car with his wife and mother-in- law. K·ª≥ ended up at Tan Son Nhut, where he ran into Kh√°nh, and the pair flew off together. Kh√°nh ordered three battalions of loyal troops to proceed to Saigon, while K·ª≥ ordered a loudspeaker plane to drone overhead and repeatedly announce \\"Brother must not fight against brother\\". In the meantime, Kh√°nh tried to lobby Westmoreland through the phone for support.  Announcement of coup  alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half- portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. Th·∫£o made a radio announcement claiming the sole objective of his military operation was to get rid of Kh√°nh, whom he described as a \\"dictator\\". The coup group made pro-Di·ªám announcements; the Catholic civilian Professor Nguyen Bao Kiem said then-US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. \\"was wrong in encouraging the coup against Di·ªám rather than correcting mistakes\\".Moyar (2004), p. 777. Lodge was one of the strongest advocates among US policymakers of Di·ªám's removal, and during his tenure as ambassador, refused to meet with the Vietnamese leader for extended periods to show his displeasure with Saigon's non-compliance with American advice.Kahin, pp. 160-185.Moyar, pp. 250-280. Th·∫£o said he intended to recall Khi√™m to Saigon to replace Kh√°nh at the head of the Armed Forces Council. Following this, a Catholic major delivered a long speech, extolling the character and achievements of Di·ªám, and mourning his loss. This gave the impression the coup plotters were planning to roll back the regime to a Di·ªám-era position and punish those involved in Di·ªám's overthrow and subsequent execution in 1963. The rebels also made broadcasts pledging to aggressively fight the Vietcong and cooperate with the United States. Throughout the day, a series of anti- Kh√°nh speeches were broadcast on radio, and the rebels claimed to have the support of four divisions; this statement was rebuffed by the junta as highly dubious and inflated. The announcements shed more light on the nature of the coup group. American government analysts concluded that the rebellion was \\"primarily a move by die-hard neo-Diemists and Catholic military militants disturbed at the rise of Buddhist influence, opposed to Gen. Kh√°nh and‚Äîin a vague, ill-thought way‚Äîdesirous of turning back the clock and undoing some of the results of the November 1963 ouster of Di·ªám.\\" Most of the military figures prominent in the coup were Catholics and members of the Dai Viet. Notable among Catholic civilian support for the action was Professor Kiem, a faculty member of the National Institute of Administration, a body that had US funding. Kiem was the leader of the National Defense Force (NDF), a body based on the secret Catholic C·∫ßn Lao Party that was used to sustain Di·ªám's autocratic rule, but had petered away after his deposal and execution. The CIA had reported that the NDF's members and associates counted among them some senior military officers including C√≥, Thi·ªáu and General Nguy·ªÖn B·∫£o Tr·ªã, commander of the 7th Division based in the town of M·ªπ Tho immediately to the south of the capital. Other notable civilian supporters of the coup were Catholic activists Father Hoan Quynh and Mai Ngo Khuc. American intelligence analysts had thought General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n was involved in the coup with Ph√°t and Th·∫£o, but altered their assessment when he stayed in the mountain resort town of Da Lat instead of heading for the capital. Their changed assessment was reinforced by the announcement that Khi√™m would be leading the replacement government if the coup was successful. Eight months after the coup was over, ƒê√¥n told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin that he had been plotting with Th·∫£o, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but said the Dai Viet and Kiem had insisted on installing the Catholic Khi√™m. A month earlier, American intelligence analysts thought Th·∫£o was planning to replace Kh√°nh as commander-in-chief with Don. Ambassador Khi√™m had been putting pressure on his bitter rival Kh√°nh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a \\"neutralist solution\\" and \\"negotiating with the communists\\", and as soon as the coup broke, he was immediately deemed by media analysts as a key figure behind the action. As Di·ªám had strongly discriminated in favor of minority Catholics and placed restrictions on Buddhism, the rebels' radio addresses caused an unsurprisingly negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau spoke from a radio station in Nha Trang, exhorting his co-religionists to support the incumbent junta.Kahin, p. 301. The Diemist speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist or anti-Di·ªám generals, such as Thi and C√≥, who had been part of the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Di·ªám respectively, and feared retribution from Th·∫£o and Ph√°t. The speeches drove many anti-Di·ªám officers who may have otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Kh√°nh.  Khi√™m prepares to return from exile  By this time, Khi√™m was preparing to return to Saigon to assist with the coup or take control if it had already succeeded. His colleagues had anticipated the Americans would lend them an aircraft to transport Khi√™m back home, but second thoughts arose among Taylor and Westmoreland. The two American generals had lost confidence in Kh√°nh, but the pro-Di·ªám ideology being expressed by Th·∫£o's supporters alienated them, due to fears the coup plotters would destabilize and polarize the country if they took power. The Americans wanted Kh√°nh out but were worried that Ph√°t and Th·∫£o could galvanize support for the beleaguered incumbent through their extremely divisive pro-Di·ªám views, which had the potential to provoke large-scale sectarian divisions in South Vietnam, playing into the hands of the communists and hindering wider American objectives. They were also worried by Th·∫£o's support for the removal of Qu√°t and the civilian components of the government, whom Th·∫£o saw was \\"too susceptible to Buddhist peacemongering\\".Kahin, p. 515. In contrast, the Americans saw civilian participation in governance as a necessity. They were also concerned a Kh√°nh victory would enhance his prestige and make his attempted deal with the communists more likely, so they wanted to see some third force emerge and defeat both Th·∫£o and Kh√°nh's factions. The Marine Brigade commander, General Khang, appealed to the US Embassy in Saigon to not allow Khi√™m to leave Washington. As a result of this, Taylor messaged the State Department: \\"Regardless [of] what ultimate outcome may be we feel Khi√™m's arrival here ... would only add tinder to what this evening appears to be very explosive situation with possibilities of internecine strife between armed forces units ... Urge he not [to] try return [to] Saigon until situation more clarified.\\" More generally, Westmoreland and Taylor by now decided it was imperative that Th·∫£o and Ph√°t fail, while Kh√°nh should also be deposed by someone else amidst the chaos. Westmoreland gave orders to US officers who were advising South Vietnamese units to stop work if the unit was being used in the coup, and pretend to be neutral even though the American high command had already decided to intervene. Failure to capture Bien Hoa Air Base and stalemate  Ph√°t was supposed to seize Bien Hoa Air Base, the second largest air force installation in the country, located in the satellite city of Bi√™n H√≤a on the northeastern outskirts of Saigon. This was to prevent K·ª≥ from mobilizing air power against them, but Ph√°t failed, as K·ª≥ had already flown to Bi√™n H√≤a to take control after dropping Kh√°nh off at Vung Tau. Ph√°t could not challenge K·ª≥'s fighter planes, which were already patrolling the air above Bien Hoa by the time they arrived. K·ª≥ then flew a short distance southwest and circled Tan Son Nhut, threatening to bomb the rebels. K·ª≥ had never liked Th·∫£o or Ph√°t and did not want them to take power.Kahin, p. 302. In threatening to flatten Tan Son Nhut, K·ª≥ appeared unconcerned about the junta members who had been captured there, nor the more than 6,000 Americans who worked there, but intervention from Westmoreland stopped any air strike. A CIA report and analysis written after the coup concluded that \\"K·ª≥'s command of the air force made him instrumental\\" in preventing Kh√°nh from being overrun, \\"until K·ª≥ changed his mind\\" on Kh√°nh's continued hold on power. Meanwhile, most of the forces of the III and IV Corps surrounding the capital supported neither Kh√°nh nor the rebels, and took no decisive action.Moyar (2006), pp. 363-364. Taylor and Westmoreland began to lobby K·ª≥ and Thi, the two most powerful generals in the junta outside Kh√°nh, hoping to enlist them in an effort to shut down Ph√°t and Th·∫£o while also removing Kh√°nh. K·ª≥ was the most convenient outlet, as the air force along with both the American and South Vietnamese military headquarters were adjacent to one another at Tan Son Nhut, making communication easy, whereas Thi was commanding I Corps in the far north. Westmoreland communicated with K·ª≥ through the latter's adviser, Robert R. Rowland. Despite his inconvenient geographical location, Thi was seen as being hostile to Kh√°nh by this point in time, and as a supporter of and commander of a region which was seen as the Buddhist heartland of Vietnam, he and his grassroots support base were strongly opposed to the Diemist pro-Catholic ideology espoused by Ph√°t and Th·∫£o. alt=Middle-aged man with greying and receding dark hair combed back. He has black bushy eyebrows. He wears a green dress uniform, with suit and tie, is clean-shaven, and has four stars on his shoulder to indicate his rank. In the short term, Taylor and Westmoreland unofficially designated K·ª≥ the duty of moderating between the coup forces and Kh√°nh's loyalists, preventing bloodshed and keeping them apart until some further action was decided upon after an emergency meeting of the Armed Forces Council could be convened. Late in the evening, the 7th Division led by General Tr·ªã based in the Mekong Delta town of M·ªπ Tho was preparing to move north into the capital to attack Ph√°t and Th·∫£o's forces, after Tr·ªã had been won over by Kh√°nh in a meeting at Ph√∫ L√¢m. However this was stopped after Westmoreland told Tri's American adviser at divisional level, a Colonel Gruenther, to tell the 7th Division commander to consult K·ª≥ before making any moves. Tri, whom the CIA had assessed as \\"anti-Communist and pro-US\\", was shortly afterwards reported to have halted the advance of his regimental-sized task force into the capital, at least for the time being. At the same time, a brigade of Vietnamese marines was being prepared to support Kh√°nh in his fight against the rebels, but it is not clear whether this was to be coordinated with Tri's 7th Division and whether Tri's decision to stand his ground instead of attacking had an effect on the marines. There were also reports of elements of the 9th Division from C·∫ßn Th∆° in the far south, and the 25th Division from the west moving towards the capital with around 30 armored personnel carriers. They were reportedly joined by the 5th Division who were coming in from Bien Hoa in the north. During all of these moves, K·ª≥'s hand was strengthened by the mistaken belief of Kh√°nh and his faction that the air force commander supported them. While this was happening, the Americans consulted with Thi and General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, the commander of III Corps surrounding Saigon, to assemble units hostile to both Kh√°nh and the current coup into a Capital Liberation Force. The Americans provided Thi with a plane so he could fly in from his I Corps headquarters in Da Nang to Saigon to lead ground forces against both the rebels and Kh√°nh. In the meantime, there was no further fighting as another round of negotiations was started. In the evening, Kh√°nh came on the radio, using a transmitter believed to be in Ba Xuyen in the Mekong Delta. Kh√°nh denounced the coup leaders as members of the C·∫ßn Lao. He said his loyalists were moving on Saigon and that the rebels had to disperse by the next day to avoid an attack. Close to midnight, there were reports that Kh√°nh's loyalists had entered the capital and had passed a rebel roadblock in the Chinese business district of Cholon, around west of central Saigon. It was reported the troops manning the roadblock did not attempt to stop Kh√°nh's men.  Coup collapse  alt=Middle-aged man with side-parted black hair and moustache, in a black suit, white shirt and brown tie. To the left is a clean- shaven Asian man with black hair and a green military cap. At 20:00, Ph√°t and Th·∫£o met K·ª≥ in a meeting at Bien Hoa Air Base organized by the Americans, and insisted on Kh√°nh's removal from power. The coup collapsed when, between midnight and dawn, anti-Th·∫£o forces swept into the city from the south along with some components of the 7th Airborne Brigade loyal to K·ª≥ from Bien Hoa in the north. Whether the rebels were genuinely defeated by the overwhelming show of strength or whether a deal was struck to end the revolt in exchange for Kh√°nh's ouster is disputed, although a large majority support the latter.Moyar (2006), p. 364.VanDeMark, p. 82. According to the second version, Ph√°t and Th·∫£o agreed to free the members of the Armed Forces Council they had arrested and withdraw in exchange for Kh√°nh's complete removal from power. Possibly as a means of saving face, Ph√°t and Th·∫£o were also given an appointment with the figurehead chief of state S·ª≠u, who was under the close control of the junta, to \\"order\\" him to sign a decree stripping Kh√°nh of the leadership of the military and organizing a meeting of the junta and Prime Minister Qu√°t's civilian cabinet. During the early morning, while the radio station was still in the hands of the rebels, a message attributed to S·ª≠u was read out; it announced Kh√°nh's removal. However, the authenticity of the announcement was put into doubt when paratroopers wrested control of the station from the rebels and S·ª≠u then spoke in person, saying he was trying to get into contact with both factions and convince them to eschew bloodshed. Later the radio station played a pre-recorded speech by Kh√°nh claiming he had regained control of the situation. There were no injuries or deaths in the coup.  Kh√°nh ousted  Ph√°t changed into civilian clothes, and made a broadcast stating \\"We have capitulated\\", before fleeing with Colonel Huynh Van Ton. Th·∫£o broadcast a message saying the coup had been effective in removing Kh√°nh. This was not the case as yet, but the Armed Forces Council later adopted a vote of no confidence in Kh√°nh. Later in the morning, while on the run, Th·∫£o made a broadcast using a military radio system to call for Kh√°nh's departure and defend his actions, which he described as being in the best interest of the nation. Eager to remove Kh√°nh, the Americans provided aircraft to transport the officers, Qu√°t, and his civilian cabinet to the meeting at short notice. The motion was precipitated by Thi, who gained the support of K·ª≥, and the final vote was unanimous. S·ª≠u and Qu√°t, who were not members of the Armed Forces Council, concurred with the military's decision to depose Kh√°nh.Kahin, p. 303. K·ª≥, Thi and Thi·ªáu became the key figures in a junta that continued with S·ª≠u and Qu√°t as a civilian front, although General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Minh became the nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces.Shaplen, pp. 310-312.Langguth, pp. 346-347. The junta ordered Kh√°nh to leave South Vietnam immediately, and made a show of support for Qu√°t and his civilian ministry. Kh√°nh was not present at his ouster, because he was north of Saigon, inspecting a display of captured communist weapons. When he heard of what was happening via a phone call from the junta secretary, General Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao, he became angry and refused to accept his fate. Kh√°nh's contended that only a full sitting of the Armed Forces Council, him included, had the power to make a leadership change. Kh√°nh told Cao of his intention to resist what he saw as an illegal seizure of power. Having concluded that Kh√°nh would fight to the bitter end, Cao went and saw Westmoreland in an open request for help. Westmoreland sent Rowland to meet with the eight available members of the AFC‚ÄîK·ª≥, Thi, Cao, Thi·ªáu, Minh, Khang, C√≥ and Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng‚Äîto devise a plan to thwart Kh√°nh's attempts to reestablish himself. = Kh√°nh's last stand = Kh√°nh used his personal aircraft to fly to different provinces, trying to rally support and promising to promote would-be allies. He flew to V≈©ng T√†u, his favorite retreat, before travelling to C·∫ßn Th∆°, the main city in the Mekong Delta. He then proceeded to S√≥c TrƒÉng, a town near the border with Cambodia. However, he received little support. Despite being forced out of power, Kh√°nh refused to entertain the concept, calling Thi through an intermediary and informing him of his removal from the command of I Corps. The deposed leader's attempted command was met with harsh words from Thi. Having ousted Kh√°nh, the generals held an afternoon press conference, claiming no decision had been definitively made. Nevertheless, they assailed Kh√°nh as a \\"troublemaker\\" who was lethargic in pursuing the Vietcong, and accused him of being obsessed with power and politics. By the end of the evening, Kh√°nh was in Da Lat when his plane ran out of fuel, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. He phoned Saigon asking for re-supply, but his rivals denied his wish. Fearing a Kh√°nh comeback, the Armed Force Council met again and unanimously resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Kh√°nh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Jasper Wilson, Kh√°nh's former confidant and adviser at corps level, to go to Da Lat to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. A year earlier, Wilson had helped Kh√°nh depose Minh. Kh√°nh initially refused to depart, calling the coup an American initiative and saying if he capitulated now, it would simply prove that the Americans were involved, as Wilson had been sent to tell him to leave. Kh√°nh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremonial farewell at Tan Son Nhut on February 24. Military bands played as he theatrically bent down and picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket; Kh√°nh said he was taking his beloved homeland with him, and vowed to one day return. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers, most notably K·ª≥ and Thi, as well as Taylor, all met him at the airport. The foes managed smiles and handshakes for the media cameras. To make the coup \\"appear as much as possible the doing of Vietnamese themselves\\", Taylor had not made any public statement after Kh√°nh's ouster, on orders from the State Department. Wearing his Grand Cross of the National Order, and carrying two more plastic bags filled with Vietnamese soil, Kh√°nh then left as Ambassador- at-Large, and was sent on a meaningless world tour, starting with a report to the United Nations in New York City.Shaplen, p. 312.  Repercussions  Ph√°t and Th·∫£o were stripped of their ranks, but nothing was initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup. The new junta decided to ignore Khi√™m's actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Ph√°t and Th·∫£o stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty.Shaplen, pp. 321-322. In May 1965, a military tribunal under K·ª≥ sentenced both Th·∫£o and Ph√°t, who were still on the run, to death in absentia. As a result, Th·∫£o had little choice but to move around indefinitely or attempt to seize power in order to save himself. He chose the latter. On May 20, a few officers and around 40 civilians, predominantly Catholic, were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate Qu√°t and kidnap K·ª≥ among others. Several of the arrested were known supporters of Th·∫£o and believed to be abetting him in evading the authorities. In July 1965, he was reported dead in unclear circumstances after being hunted down; an official report claimed he died of injuries while on a helicopter taking him to Saigon, after being captured north of the city. It was generally assumed he was murdered or tortured to death on the orders of some junta members.Shaplen, pp. 338-344.Hammer, p. 249. Ph√°t remained on the run for three years. During that time, K·ª≥'s power was eclipsed by Thi·ªáu in a continuing power struggle, and the latter removed K·ª≥ supporters in the military from positions of high power. In June 1968, Ph√°t came out of hiding and surrendered himself to the authorities. He was pardoned by a military court in August and released. After he too had been exiled the following year, Thi said \\"It was necessary to move against him because our army was dependent on the Americans, and we could not get along without them.\\" Thi accused overseas-based Di·ªám supporters for the coup. Despite his failure to take power, Khi√™m said Kh√°nh's demise made him \\"very happy. I think my objective has been realized.\\" The Soviet Union responded to the coup by saying \\"The farce will go on\\" and lampooning South Vietnam's \\"bankrupt politicians and warriors\\".

It was founded by Sharif El-Gamal in 2003. Management Sharif El-Gamal is the chairman and chief executive officer of Soho Properties. He founded the firm in 2003. His partners in the company include his brother Sammy El-Gamal and Nour Mousa. Properties =45‚Äì51 Park Place= Park51 In July 2009, Soho Properties purchased the building and property at 45‚Äì47 Park Place. In 2009, Soho Properties took over Con Edison's 99-year lease of 49‚Äì51 Park Place. In February 2010, Soho Properties informed Con Edison that it sought to exercise the purchase option on the lease and the two entered protracted negotiations. The development was envisioned as a 13-story Islamic community center in Lower Manhattan. The developers hoped it would promote interfaith dialogue within the greater community. Due to its proposed location two blocks from the World Trade Center site, it was widely and controversially referred to as the \\"Ground Zero mosque\\". In August 2011, The New York Times reported that El-Gamal was quietly proceeding with efforts to move Park51 forward, embracing a \\"slower, more deliberate and more realistic approach\\" than before. In April 2014, however, El-Gamal announced Soho's plan to demolish the 45‚Äì51 Park Place properties. The current plans for the Park51 site include a three-story museum of Islamic culture. 45 Park Place In May 2016, Soho Properties announced that it had secured $219 million in construction financing for 45 Park Place, a 43-story luxury condominium development. The financing structure, involving banks from the Middle East, Asia and Europe, is Sharia-compliant. El-Gamal said, \\"Essentially, it's the largest syndicated Sharia-compliant construction loan in New York City.\\" Construction at 45 Park Place is currently underway. A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the site on June 2, 2016. The tower is expected to be completed in 2018. Adjacent to 45 Park Place at 49‚Äì51 Park Place, Soho Properties is constructing a three-story museum and sanctuary designed by architect Jean Nouvel. =560 7th Avenue= Soho Properties and MHP Real Estate Services purchased the Parsons School of Design at 560 Seventh Avenue in 2014 for $62.3 million. In 2015, the same partnership purchased 19,772 square feet of unused air rights from the Neil Simon Theatre for $8.9 million to build a 238-room Dream Hotel at the 560 Seventh Avenue site. In November 2017, it was reported that Soho Properties, in partnership with MHP and Flintlock Construction Services, is in late-stage negotiations to build New York City's first Margaritaville hotel and restaurant at the site. The development also includes plans for a new home for the Garment Center Synagogue, which had a long-term lease at the property. While the site is under construction, the congregation has been relocated to 1384 Broadway. =31 West 27th Street= In November 2009, Soho Properties purchased a 12-story office building located at 31 West 27th Street for $45.7 million. El- Gamal said, \\"We just bought it for the income. It's got great long-term leases, and the financing was really attractive. We have five years at a very attractive interest rate, and it's probably the best B building in this submarket.\\" Soho Properties purchased it from the Witkoff Group, which had purchased the building in 2006 for $31.5 million. Soho Properties sold the property to the San Francisco-based Walnut Hill Group in 2012 for $65 million.  Coronavirus outbreak  The production of Soho Properties takes a break amid the partial construction ban in New York, as does the CEO of the company, Sharif El-Gamal, as he recovers from the virus, published last week in The Real Deal. El-Gamal infected 60% of his staff with coronavirus shortly before the shelter-in-place order by the governor of New York. Although he's on the mend now, El-Gamal told TRD he'd been struggling with some severe symptoms, like intense fatigue.

Setting The ecoregion consists of four separate blocks of mixed forest surrounded by lower lying areas of hardwood forest as follows: the Northern Allegheny Plateau in New York State and Pennsylvania including the Catskill Mountains, the Poconos, the Finger Lakes and French Creek areas; areas of the north and central Appalachians; the western Allegheny Plateau in western Pennsylvania and Ohio; and the upland plain around Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Climate The ecoregion has a humid continental climate with warm to hot summers. Flora Most of this forest was cleared in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Although all individual trees species still remain, their quantities and distribution are radically different from the forest's original state. The Finger Lakes area has a particularly rich mixture of woodland, while the pinewoods in the Pocono Mountains are a unique habitat.Allegheny Highlands forests Upland hardwood forests include red maple (Acer rubrum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black cherry (Prunus serotina), and black birch (Betula lenta). Allegheny hardwood forests consist of black cherry, white ash (Fraxinus americana), and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). Mixed-oak forests of northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), eastern black oak (Quercus velutina), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea) grow along major river drainages and on steep, drier slopes. Northern hardwood forests include sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech. Also common are yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), red maple, black cherry, and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). Hemlock tends to follow stream drainages, while white pine prefers drier ridgetops. White ash, American elm (Ulmus americana), basswood (Tilia americana), and hop hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) can occur locally. Boreal forests occur at high elevations, particularly on the peaks of the Catskill Mountains. These forests include balsam fir (Abies balsamea), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), mountain ash (Sorbus americana), and red cherry (Prunus pensylvanica). Wild raisin (Viburnum cassinoides) and mountain holly (Ilex mucronata) are shrubs that grow in high elevation swamps, bogs, and ledgetops. Fauna Wildlife of the forest includes bobcat, American black bear, coyote, porcupine, flying squirrel. Birds include barred owl. Threats and preservation As well as logging and clearance for farmland another factor that affects the make-up of the forest is grazing, especially by deer, while suburban and tourist development is resulting in more habitat loss in the Catskills and the Finger Lakes especially. Protected areas include Allegheny National Forest, Sproul State Forest, Cook Forest State Park, Hammersley Wild Area, and Woodbourne Forest and Wildlife Preserve in Pennsylvania, and Allegany State Park, Catskill Park, Bergen-Byron Swamp and the shores of Hemlock Lake and Canadice Lakes in New York.

Such a license is labelled unlimited because it has no limits on the tonnage, power, or geographic location of the vessel that the holder of the license is allowed to serve upon. A master mariner would therefore be allowed to serve as the master of a merchant ship of any size, of any type, operating anywhere in the world,Master Mariner Requirements and it reflects the highest level of professional qualification amongst mariners and deck officers. The term master mariner has been in use at least since the 13th century, reflecting the fact that in guild or livery company terms, such a person was a master craftsman in this specific profession (e.g., master carpenter, master blacksmith). United Kingdom The Extra Master's qualification (issued only in the United Kingdom), which was discontinued in the 1990s, used to be the highest professional qualification and it was the pinnacle for any mariner to achieve. There are also various other levels of master's certificates, which may be restricted or limited to home trade/near coastal voyages and/or by gross tonnage. The holder of a restricted master's certificate is not referred to as a \\"master mariner\\". In the British Merchant Navy a master mariner who has sailed in command of an ocean-going merchant ship will be titled captain. A professional seafarer who holds a restricted or limited master's certificate who has sailed in command of a ship (i.e. appropriate to the size, power or geographic limits of their certificate) can also be titled captain. In the UK, an unrestricted master's certificate is colloquially called a \\"master's ticket\\" or a \\"master's.\\" It is sometimes still referred to as a \\"Class 1\\" or \\"Master Foreign-Going\\" as it was named during the latter part of the 20th century. The conventions or acts governing the certificate have evolved alongside the shipping industry and the official name of a master mariner's qualification has varied over the years. The UK Maritime & Coastguard Agency, in line with the amended STCW convention,STCW currently title the certificate Master Unlimited. The qualification is awarded to those senior ships officers whose competency has been assessed under the STCW A-II/2 syllabus. sac United States In the United States, the term was introduced in the mid-19th century. A Master's license states the area of operations and maximum gross tonnage of vessel for which that license is valid. \\"Master, Any Gross Tons, Oceans\\" is the highest level license that it is possible to achieve. Holding this license, a person is then referred to as a 'Master Mariner' or 'Unlimited Master'. Every commercial vessel must have a 'Master', even a small sight-seeing tour boat operating on a Lake. The license required for that vessel would have restrictions noted on the license, for example \\"Master, Not more than 100 GRT upon Inland Waters\\". There are tens of thousands Master's licenses issued by the United States Coast Guard, but perhaps less than one thousand which are Unlimited Master's. The Master of any vessel is generally referred to as 'Captain'.

Nearly half of the bills paid in the US during 2013 were done via electronic bill payment. Also, during 2014, nearly 48% of all online shopping in North America were made with a credit card. Globally, online payments are expected to exceed 3 trillion Euros (approx. US$3.2 trillion) in the next 5 years.  Privacy and security features  OBeP systems protect consumer personal information by not requiring the disclosure of account numbers or other sensitive personal data to online merchants or other third parties.FIS News Release. March 18, 2008. During the checkout process, the merchant redirects the consumer to their financial institution's online banking site where they login and authorize charges. After charges are authorized, the financial institution redirects the consumer back to the merchant site. All network communications are protected using industry standard encryption. Additionally, communications with the OBeP network take place on a virtual private network, not over the public Internet. In order to be positive that your identity, information and other personal features are truly secure, the following cautions should be taken: May 22, 2011. Make sure a secure browser is being used. Read all privacy policies provided. Many individuals simply skip over such important information that could spell out potential risks. If a risk seems unnecessary and odd, it would be safer to skip this payment rather than take the risk with one's hard earned money. Keep all personal information private. If phone numbers, social security numbers or other private, important information is asked for one should be cautious. Banking information is important information as it is, asking for unnecessary personal information should be a red flag of suspicious behavior. Selecting businesses that are trustworthy is key. Most companies will email a customer with a transaction receipt upon payment. Keeping a record of these is important in order to have proof of purchase or payment. Lastly, checking bank statements regularly is crucial in keeping up-to-date with transactions.  Costs  Costs associated with fraud, estimated at 1.2% of sales by online retailers in 2009,CyberSource Online Fraud Report 2010. are reported to be dramatically reduced with OBeP, because the issuer bank is responsible for the authentication of the credit transaction and provides guaranteed funds to the merchant.eCommerce Times.

One variety, D. aromatica, is a source of camphor.  Species  The name Kapur can refer to the following species from the Dryobalanops genus: * D. aromatica * D. beccarii * D. fusca * D. keithii * D. lanceolata * D. oblongifolia * D. rappa  Deforestation  Kapur is logged from old-growth forest, often illegally. These forests have developed over the course of hundreds of years. When harvested, these trees are often between 250 and 1000 years old. For a tree from the family Dipterocarpaceae, it takes approximately 100 years to reach a height of 30 meters. Most of the species that are sold as Kapur, are listed on the IUCN Red List for endangered species. For example, D. fusca is critically endangered. Overexploitation has led to large scale deforestation in the tropics. The International Tropical Timber Organization is concerned with conserving the habitat of trees producing tropical timber. According to FSC, certified tropical hardwood can counteract deforestation. Forests that are managed according to the FSC standards, become economically valuable and might therefore not be converted to farmland. However, other organisations advise consumers to stay away from Kapur altogether to avoid logging of centuries-old trees.
