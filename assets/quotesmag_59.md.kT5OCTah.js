This is a rhizomatous perennial grass growing to a maximum height between 1 and 1.5 meters. The leaves are up to about 28 centimeters long and have very rough, minutely toothed edges. The inflorescence is a loose, open array of wavy, hairlike branches bearing rows of spikelets. Each spikelet is a flat fruit with a rough, bristly lemma without an awn, and no glumes. Some of the spikelet branches develop within the sheaths of the leaves and are cleistogamous. This grass is sometimes used for erosion control and restoring wetlands.

Until his thirties he made his name as a classical artist, but has since become renowned for his involvement in and advocacy of contemporary music. He travels widely and is much in demand for workshops and summer schools in addition to sustaining a schedule of adventurously programmed concerts. Biography Rohan de Saram was born to Ceylonese parents in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. His father was Robert de Saram and his mother was Miriam Pieris Deraniyagala. His paternal grandfather was Colonel Fredrick de Saram, OBE and his maternal grandfather was Sir Paul Pieris. At age eleven he studied with Gaspar Cassad√≥ in Siena and Florence. In 1955 at the age of 16 he was the first winner of the Guilhermina Suggia Award, enabling him to study in the UK with Sir John Barbirolli and in Puerto Rico with Pablo Casals. Casals said of him \\"There are few of his generation that have such gifts\\". In the following year he won a Harriet Cohen International Music Award. At the invitation of Dimitri Mitropoulos, who described him in 1957 as \\"a rare genius...a born musician... an amazing...cellist\\", Rohan was invited to give his Carnegie Hall debut in 1960 with the New York Philharmonic, playing Khachaturian's Cello Concerto under the baton of Stanis≈Çaw Skrowaczewski. Gregor Piatigorsky presented him with a special bow. He has lived in London since 1972, first and foremost as a performer, although he has also taught at Trinity College of Music, London. From 1979 to 2005 de Saram was a member of the Arditti Quartet but now works with other artists to pursue his own artistic vision. He has also toured and recorded with Markus Stockhausen's \\"Possible Worlds\\" group. He worked personally with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Francis Poulenc, Sir William Walton and Dmitri Shostakovich. He has performed with the major orchestras of Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and the former Soviet Union with conductors such as Barbirolli, Sir Adrian Boult, Zubin Mehta, Seiji Ozawa and William Steinberg. In ensemble or as a soloist, he has premiered works by Luciano Berio, Bose, Benjamin Britten, Sylvano Bussotti, John Cage, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Philip Glass, Sofia Gubaidulina, Paul Hindemith, Mauricio Kagel, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti (Racine 19), Conlon Nancarrow, Henri Pousseur, Wolfgang Rihm, Jeremy Dale Roberts (Deathwatch Cello Concerto, written for de Saram), Alfred Schnittke, Iannis Xenakis (Kottos ) and Toshio Hosokawa (the concerto Chant for cello and orchestra). Berio was so impressed by his performance of Il Ritorno degli Snovidenia that he wrote Sequenza XIV (2002) specially for de Saram, incorporating drumming on the body of the cello drawn from de Saram's skills with the Kandyan drum. The work was given its world and numerous national premieres by de Saram who then also made the premiere recording. He plays the standard classical cello works, including the great concerti, sonata cycles and Bach's six Solo Cello Suites. He founded the De Saram Clarinet Trio and a duo with his brother Druvi de Saram. He is one of relatively few new music interpreters to have explored the world of improvisation. He has made numerous recordings, both with the Arditti Quartet and as soloist, including Vivaldi's Sonatas, Edmund Rubbra's Soliloquy for cello and orchestra, Britten's Cello Suites No 1-3, John Mayer's Ragamalas and Prabhanda, Xenakis' Kottos and Elliott Carter's Figment I and II, and works by Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Peter Ruzicka, Gelhaar, Pr√∂ve and Steinke. 2011 releases include Harmonic Labyrinth with Preethi de Silva, and the first of two volumes of de Saram in Concert featuring magnificent Wigmore Hall performances of the Kodaly Sonata for Solo Cello (his score carries Kodaly's hand-written praise for his performance before the composer in May 1960), together with the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata, in which he is accompanied by his brother Druvi. Personal life He is married to Rosemary de Saram. They have a daughter, Sophia (Oberon Symphony Orchestra) and a son, Suren (of Bombay Bicycle Club) Honours In December 2004, Rohan de Saram was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. In December 2005 he received the Deshamanya, a national honour of Sri Lanka, given by the President of Sri Lanka.

McWhorter George G. McWhorter (February 27, 1833 - May 21, 1891) was a Florida lawyer and Democratic politician who served on the Florida Supreme Court from 1885 to 1887. McWhorter was born in Coosada, Alabama in Autauga County, the son of Alwyn Amzi and Sarah Hamlin. He attended college in Alabama and Georgia. He married Mary Louise Roche from Columbia, South Carolina in 1856, a year before moving to Santa Rosa County in western Florida near Milton. The McWhorters briefly moved to Birmingham, where he practiced law, and returned to Milton in 1859 and was admitted to the Bar. He built a solid reputation as an attorney working for the railroad and local timber companies and arguing cases before the Florida Supreme Court. Civil War and Reconstruction experiences galvanized McWhorter's political views. He became a leader of the Florida Democratic party and staunchly resisted Reconstruction. In 1876, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives and became Speaker of the House. He served in the House for two years and left office to campaign around the state for other candidates in the 1880 elections. In 1884, he served as an elector for President Grover Cleveland. He also supported Edward A. Perry's campaign for governor, and was appointed January 13, 1885, by Governor Perry at a salary of $3,000 per year to replace Chief Justice Randall, who had retired in January 1885. He served on the Bench until July 1, 1887, when he became the chair of the Florida Railroad Commission. He served on the Commission from August 17, 1887 until ill health forced his retirement April 30, 1891. He died at his home in Santa Rosa County, May 21, 1891.

Thompson Sr., the founder of the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores. Career Although young, John Philp Thompson began his work in the business at an early age while it was still the Southland Ice Company and worked beside his father in its evolution from a small ice company into the Southland Corporation, which had expanded to include Oak Farms Dairy into its eventual \\"invention\\" of the convenience store concept. He served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. By 1948, the Dallas Times Herald wrote that the young \\"Johnny Thompson\\" was destined to be one of \\"Tomorrow's Leaders\\". Before his father, Joe C. Thompson, died in 1961, he passed the reins of the convenience store chain to John, who later grew it from a Texas chain into the global giant that in 1985 had total annual revenues exceeding $12.7 billion, taking the new concept of a convenience store into the world markets of Mexico, Japan, Far Eastern countries, Australia and Europe. John Philp Thompson again made history when under his guidance, Southland Corp. (7-Eleven) raised $81.5 million for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, prompting Jerry Lewis to write, ‚ÄúYou accomplished so much, and you and your father before you built a monument. The good you've done will never be forgotten.‚Äù Thompson continued to measure the ‚Äúmonument‚Äù of the company not only by the numbers it produced, but by the good it could do. Oak Farms became the first national corporate sponsor of The March of Dimes, and 7-Eleven contributed to the purchase of land for a refuge for the American bald eagle via the National Wildlife Federation where he served on the Board of Directors. During his time as 7-Eleven's CEO, John also led the company to purchase CITGO Oil and Ticketmaster, overseeing their operations as well. It was this experience that led him to recognize the country's need for environmentally friendly energy options. When his innovative attempt to install \\"alternative fueling stations for electric cars\\" didn't work, he nevertheless stood by his belief that those with influence could and should seek ways to balance environmental stewardship with the need to create profit. He expressed this in the 1979 edition of U.S. News & World Reports \\"How to Get America Moving Again: 20 Leaders Tell What's Needed\\" when he said: > \\"We need to develop areas of mutual understanding. Environmentalists need to > realize they will not get everything they want, and businessmen need to > commit themselves to preserving the environment...we need to establish > alternate energy resources and certainly some very definite conservation > programs.\\" Thompson was a champion not only for environmental causes, but also for making education available to all. In 1989, the company began a literacy initiative, \\"People Who Read Achieve\\", which continues to raise funds for organizations that sponsor reading programs. He also was one of the primary founders and innovators of the Dallas Community College District Foundation's Rising Star Scholarship Program that sought to make college education available to children in Texas, and served as the Chairman of the Chancellor's Council for his state's universities. He joined his brothers, Jere W. Thompson Sr. and Jodie Thompson, in establishing the Joe C. Thompson Conference Center,Joe C. Thompson Conference Center dedicated to \\"providing excellent conference facilities, services, and programs for people to continue their educational development and personal enrichment.\\" As a result of serving on both boards related to public education institutions in the medical fields and as Chairman of Presbyterian Hospital, he became aware of the need for public and private medical institutions to be able to share research in order for greater strides to be made. This would prove to be a ten-year struggle of untangling bureaucratic tape, but eventually Thompson was awarded by Colin Powell for his tireless dedication towards paving the way for doctors and researchers from both public and private medical research facilities in the state of Texas to be able to share relevant information that could advance health for the greater community. An avid leader of the local, national and international business and philanthropic communities, he was known for saying to other CEOs: > \\"CEOs are the world's unelected leaders. We are given positions of power > that are conducive to leaders of a small country. Therefore, we are > responsible to make all our decisions with people in mind and not just with > the numbers they represent to > us.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091212195512/http://www.thejohnphilpthompsonfoundation.org/TheLegacyOfJohnPhilpThompson.html =7-Eleven= During Thompson's 48 years with the company, he guided The Southland Corp. as it grew from an ice company into the world's largest convenience store retailer. During his tenure, the company introduced the Slurpee, launching the frozen carbonated beverage (FCB) category in 1967. Fresh-brewed coffee-to-go was first offered in 1964, and the Big Gulp soft drink was launched in 1980. The company opened regional distribution centers and began making specific merchandise deliveries to stores‚Äîan early version of the sophisticated inventory control and daily delivery system it uses today. Thompson oversaw the success of private label brands and the growth of Southland's in-house advertising department into the independent and award- winning Stanford Agency. Southland's growth included building what is now the Tower at Cityplace, a 42-story tower that housed the corporate offices of 7-Eleven until 2007. Shortly before his father Joe C. Thompson's death in 1961, John Thompson became president of Southland, which then operated some 600 convenience stores. By the time he was named Chairman and CEO in 1969, the company had changed dramatically due to expansion into new markets and the acquisition of related businesses. As that decade closed, there were 3,810 7-Eleven stores, Gristede's grocery stores, Barricini candy shops and Bradshaw's supermarkets operating in 35 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. Under Thompson's leadership, the company also began franchising 7-Eleven stores, introduced the \\"Oh Thank Heaven\\" slogan, and made its first public stock offering. During the 1970s and 1980s, 7-Eleven stores expanded into Mexico, Japan and other Far Eastern countries, Australia and Europe; and Southland acquired 50-percent interest from Cavenham Limited in some 350 retail stores in the United Kingdom. From $120 million in sales in 1961, the company embarked on 24 consecutive years of record revenues including benchmark years in 1971 (first billion-dollar year), 1976 (first two-billion dollar year), 1978 (first three-billion dollar year) and 1979 (first billion- dollar quarter). Cracking Fortune magazine's list of the Top 50 merchandising firms in the United States at number 49 in 1965, the company moved up to 45th place in just one year...and leaped to 18th in 1975. By 1985, total annual revenues exceeded $12.7 billion.John P.

Garbutt. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Frank A. Garbutt Frank A. Garbutt, an inventor, industrialist and movie pioneer, was one of the most prominent citizens of Los Angeles in the late 19th and early 20th Century. He invented and secured patents on certain oil drilling tools in the late 1880s that were the initial source of his wealth. Garbutt also became involved in other businesses. He owned oil wells and was one of the original investors in aviation pioneer Glenn Martin's aircraft business (later to become Martin Marietta). He also owned interests in a boat-building business and a business operating ferries from San Pedro to Terminal Island. He also played a role in the founding of Famous Players-Lasky (later Paramount Studios), Union Oil Company and the Automobile Club of Southern California. Garbutt House and the Garbutt-Hathaway Estate In 1923, Garbutt acquired a hilltop site overlooking the Silver Lake reservoir with views of the Pacific Ocean, the Santa Monica and Verdugo Mountains and the downtown skyline. Garbutt and his family built three houses on the site, which came to be known as the Garbutt- Hathaway Estate. Garbutt himself lived in the 20-room mansion built between 1926 and 1928 that came to be known as Garbutt House. The house has nearly of space, rises to its crest and was built like a citadel out of concrete to survive earthquakes, floods and fires. His daughter Melodile later recalled that the entire first floor was poured in one pouring that took two days and one night of steady pouring with three shifts of workers. Due to an intense fear of fire, Garbutt even had the roof and walls built of concrete, installed steel-reinforced doors and allowed no fireplaces in the home. (\\"All that remains of the estate, bounded by Duane and Effie streets and Silverlake and Glendale boulevards, is the main house, a three-story, 20-room mansion of marble floors, concrete roof and walls, steel-reinforced doors and no fireplaces--Garbutt had a terror of fire.\\")(\\"To protect against fire, all the doors leading into the rooms are steel and there is no fireplace.\\") A subsequent owner noted that the concrete construction was \\"comparable to any of the finest bunkers.\\" The house also had bronze window frames, hand carved teak and marble floors. The first floor was entirely travertine, and Garbutt hired an artist who spent several months painting the beams in the living room. Garbutt worked at his inventions at the Silver Lake mansion, building race cars, inventing a soapless detergent, and trying to invent a superior chewing gum. Preservation battles and residential development Garbutt died in 1947, but his son and two daughters continued to live at the estate after his death. One of his daughters never married and lived at Garbutt House until 1960, when the estate was sold. Daughter Melodile recalled that they sold the estate after her brother and husband had died, and her sister did not want to live by herself in the big house. The houses sat dormant for several years as owners battled with the city and preservationists over plans to raze the three houses and build condominiums or a large housing development on the site. In 1975, Los Angeles Times architecture critic, John Pastier, noted that the estate's \\"arcadian acreage\\" was 99% undeveloped and \\"looks like a park.\\" Pastier wrote a lengthy column criticizing a plan to cover the estate with 530 condominium units requiring removal of 60% of the property's trees. He argued for a scaled-back development that would preserve the three houses as a \\"tesimony to the area's history and to a vanished way of life.\\" In 1978, two of the houses were torn down to make room for a 100-home development, but the Garbutt House was spared. In 1982, nearly 100 homes were built on the property and were compared to \\"a village at the foot of the castle.\\" Garbutt House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Filming location The Garbutt-Hathaway Estate has long been a popular filming location, dating back to the silent film era. In 1981, a low-budget Carolco horror film called SuperstitionSuperstition (about a haunted house on the site where a woman was put to death as a witch 300 years earlier) was shot at Garbutt House. The shooting of Superstition was reportedly subject to incidents of alleged \\"haunting\\", including one in which a security guard who was required to spend the night in the house quit after reporting he had seen a \\"ghost\\", another security guard who saw the helmet on a Knight's armor display float off the shoulders of the armor and disappear into the kitchen area and another in which the film's director was locked in a room when the doorknob fell off and had to be pried free with crowbars. (\\"Then, he said, a director got locked into a room upstairs when the doorknob fell off and 'we had to pry him out with crowbars.' Also during the film's shooting, a security guard who slept overnight in the house quit one morning, claiming he had seen a ghost.\\") Current ownership The mansion is currently owned by American Apparel founder Dov Charney. It was used as temporary lodging for visitors to the company while Charney was chairman. He reportedly added a sculpture of a giant raised middle finger outside the front door.

Charles Hubert Millevoye (24 December 1782 in Abbeville - 12 August 1816 in Paris) was a French poet several times honored by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He was a transitional figure between the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries as revealed in his Romantic poems. His poem beginning \\"Dans les bois l'amoureux Myrtil\\" (La Fauvette) is also well known as set to music in Vieille Chanson by Georges Bizet, as well as Le Mancenillier, as referred to in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine and Louis Moreau Gottschalk's serenade for piano Le Mancenillier, Op. 11. Life First taught by an uncle, he later studied with M. Bardoux, a professor in the College of Abbeville. His father died when he was 13 years old, and he was then sent by his family to Paris to finish his education. He began to study law, then became a bookseller, but finally abandoned both to commit himself to writing. Millevoye married Margaret Flora Delattre on 31 August 1813 in Abbeville and only had one child, Charles Alfred (9 October 1813 in Abberville -6 June 1891 in Sadroc), who served as magistrate in charge of the judicial organization of Savoie in 1860. Of his marriage with Irma Malvina Leclerc-Thouin on 7 June 1845 in Paris, Charles Alfred had three sons, of which Lucien Millevoye (1850, Grenoble-1918, Paris) was a member of Parliament of Amiens from 1882 to 1893, of Paris from 1898 to 1918, and Director of the newspaper La Patrie. Works Millevoye in his time was well known for his poetry, which was a mixture of classical reminiscences and sentimental style. Sainte-Beuve writes the following about him: \\"Entre Delille finit et Lamartine qui pr√©lude, une p√¢le et douce √©toile un moment a brill√©: c'est lui.\\" (\\"Between Delille's end and Lamartine's prelude, a pale and gentle star momentaneously shines: it is he.\\") Millevoye mainly wrote elegies, of which La Chute des Feuilles (The Fall of the Leaves) is one of the most famous. Besides his poems, Millevoye also made fresh translations of the Iliad, the Bucolica of Virgil and some dialogues of Lucian of Samosata. He died at the age of 34. His complete works appeared ten years later, in 1826.

History The facility, which was designed by George Oatley and Willie Swinton Skinner, was built at a cost of ¬£200,000 and opened as the Croydon Mental Hospital on 26 June 1903. This was reputedly the first institution to be called a 'mental hospital' and never appears officially to have been called an asylum. The hospital was extended in the early 20th century with the addition of a nurses' home, two further blocks for female patients and four villas. The hospital became Chelsham Mental Hospital in 1923. It was a pioneering centre for psychosurgery. Surgeon John Crumbie designed his own leucotome (instrument for cutting the white matter in the brain) which was constructed by Warlingham's assistant clerk of works, and referred to by Wylie McKissock, who operated with a Cushing brain needle, as a \\"mechanical egg- whisk\\".W McKissock 1943 The technique of pre-frontal leucotomy.

Journal of Mental Science 88: 534‚Äì40. It also had a specialist unit to treat patients suffering from alcohol and drug dependency. The facility went on to become Warlingham Park Hospital in 1937 and joined the National Health Service in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and eventually closed in 1999. The archives were deposited with the Bethlem Royal Hospital which subsequently became the primary provider of mental health care to residents of Croydon. Although the Grade II listed water tower was retained, the remainder of the buildings were demolished to make way for an up-market housing estate known as Greatpark.

Under the Bury Improvement Act 1846 a board of twenty-seven improvement commissioners was formed for Bury. The Improvement Commissioners District was enlarged in 1872. A charter of incorporation dated 9 September 1876 created the town a municipal borough and it was further extended in 1885. Under the Local Government Act 1888 Bury was constituted a county borough. This meant that it was independent of Lancashire County Council, exercising both the powers of a borough and county council. However, Bury remained in Lancashire for judicial and other purposes such as lieutenancy and shrievalty. The county borough was extended in 1911 when it gained the Warth area from Radcliffe Urban District and in 1933 when it absorbed much of the dissolved Bury Rural District.The Lancashire (Southern Areas) Review Order 1933F A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol II: Northern England, London, 1991 The County Borough of Bury was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 and its territory transferred to Greater Manchester to form the central part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury. Corporation On incorporation the borough was divided into five wards: Church, Redvales, East, Moorside and Elton. The corporation consisted of a mayor, ten aldermen and thirty councillors, with six councillors and one alderman returned for each ward. On the extension of the borough in 1933 the size of the borough council was increased to thirty-three councillors and eleven aldermen.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1933, p.14 In 1969 wards were reorganised and the council increased in size to thirty-six councillors and twelve aldermen.The Times, 12 May 1969 =Politics= The members elected to the early borough council did not use political labels. However, by 1901 the borough was under the control of the Liberal Party. In 1904 Conservatives and Liberal Unionists gained a majority.The Times, 2 November 1904, p.6 In the following year the first Labour councillors were elected.The Times, 2 November 1905, p.4 The council was under no overall control (although generally with a pro-Conservative administration) until 1937.

They were an anvil, for iron forging; a golden fleece, for wool; a pair of crossed shuttles, for the cotton industry; and a papyrus plant for the paper trade. The quarters were divided by a \\"cross party and fretty\\". The crest above the shield was a bee, symbolic of industry in general, between two cotton flowers.C Wilfrid Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 The Latin motto chosen was Vincit Omnia Industria or \\"work conquers all\\".

And for a Crest: On a wreath of the colours, Upon a mount a bee volant between two flowers of the cotton-tree slipped all proper. Utilities =Water supply= Under the Bury Improvement Act 1872, the Bury Improvement Commissioners acquired the two local water supply undertakings: the Bury and Radcliffe Waterworks Company and the Haslingden and Rawtenstall Waterworks Company. In 1876 this became the water department of Bury Corporation. In 1900 the corporation and eight adjoining local authorities formed the Bury and District Joint Water Board. Other than Bury, the water board's members were the municipal boroughs of Haslingden, Radcliffe and Rawtenstall, and the urban districts of Kearsley, Little Lever, Ramsbottom, Tottington and Whitefield. In 1935 the undertaking was renamed as the Irwell Valley Water Board. In 1960 the Irwell Valley Water Board was voluntarily absorbed by the water department of Manchester Corporation. =Gas= In 1857 the Bury Improvement Commissioners purchased the private gasworks, which dated from 1828. The streets of the town were lit by gas from 1836. The Corporation gas undertaking was nationalised by the Gas Act 1948, passing to the North West Gas Board on 1 May 1949.The Gas (Allocation of Undertakings to Area Boards and Gas Council) Order, 1949 (S.I. 1949/742) =Electricity= The Corporation was granted powers in 1890 to supply electricity within the borough, and \\"to construct works and break up streets therein; to lay down wires and other apparatus; to levy rates and exercise other powers\\".

The first section of the Bury Corporation Tramways was opened on 3 June 1903. More lines were opened in 1904 and 1905, and extensions made in 1915. Bury trams reached Tottington, Unsworth and Whitefield outside the borough boundaries, and the corporation operated services on behalf of Radcliffe Urban District Council. A joint running arrangement was also made with Salford Corporation Transport. Motorbuses were first operated in 1925, and the last tram ran on 13 February 1949. In 1969 the borough's transport operations passed to SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive.

The encoded protein shows structural homology to FKBP immunophilins, which bind to the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. FKBP6 is essential for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis during spermatogenesis. Targeted inactivation of FKBP6 in mice results in infertile males, but apparently normal females. Rats with spermatogenic failure at meiosis were found to have a deletion in the exon 8 portion of the FKBP6 gene. Mutations in this gene have been associated with male infertility in humans.

Becerra (April 25, 1870 ‚Äì January 7, 1940) was a prolific Mexican writer, poet, and politician. He produced pioneering historical, linguistic, philological, and ethnographic studies relating to his country's pre-Columbian and early colonial past. He held important posts in the Mexican Federal Government as well as in the state governments of Tabasco and Chiapas. He was a distinguished member of the Mexican Academy of History. Biography Marcos Enrique Becerra was born in Teapa, Tabasco, to Camilo Becerra y Ballinas, a native of San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Chiapas, and Luisa S√°nchez Formento. Becerra completed his early schooling in his hometown. In 1900, by way of independent study, he received a teaching degree from the Instituto Ju√°rez of San Juan Bautista. During his youth he worked as a bookbinder, scribe, store clerk, theatre prompter, and, eventually, teacher. One of his very first published works, Guia del lenguaje usual para hablar con propiedad, pureza y correcci√≥n, dates from this period (1901) and is based on his autodidactic studies of the Spanish language. Fame of his remarkable erudition spread quickly and he was encouraged to run in forthcoming elections for Federal Deputy for the State of Tabasco, succeeding in his first attempt. During the final years of the Porfiriato he held the federal post of Director General of Secondary Education of the Secretariat of Public Education. At the XVII International Congress of Americanists, celebrated in Mexico City in September 1910, Becerra presented an important historical paper on Hern√°n Cort√©s's 1524-25 expedition to Las Hibueras. The next year, he returned to Tabasco to serve in Governor Manuel Mestre Ghigliazza's administration as Secretary General of Government and as Director of Public Education; consequent to the assassination of President Francisco I. Madero in February 1913 both Ghigliazza and Becerra resigned their posts in protest. In 1914, Becerra moved to Tuxtla Guti√©rrez (the Chiapas state capital), where he would labor as an educator and occupy the same post of Director of Public Education for ten years; during which time he successfully reorganized the state's educational system, founded a school of commerce as well as the Internado Ind√≠gena de San Crist√≥bal (the San Crist√≥bal Indian Boarding School), which was a model of its kind. In 1921, while still in Tuxtla, he published an important lexicographical work titled La nueva gram√°tica castellana, which, like all his published writings, was the fruit of autodidactic erudition. In 1932, appeared what remains one of his best known scholarly works, Nombres geogr√°ficos ind√≠genas de Chiapas, a study of Mayan place names. To these followed sundry studies, published as monographs or articles, on the languages and traditions of the Ch'ol, Mangue, Nahua, Yucatec Maya, and Zoque. In 1954, occurred the posthumous publication of Becerra's monumental 800 page Rectificaciones y adiciones al Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola: a work which encompasses thousands of words and definitions, is rich in indigenous etymologies and grounded in lexicographical authorities. Marcos E. Becerra, during the last ten years of his life, was a numerary member of the Mexican Academy of History and held seat 21. He was married twice and was twice a widower, He died, following a long illness, in Mexico City on January 7, 1940.

History In 1881, Charles Fields established a homestead where the community of Fields is located today. Fields built a stagecoach roadhouse to serve the stage route between Winnemucca, Nevada, and Burns. A one-room school was established at the site around 1900 with one teacher. Fields sold his business to John Smyth in 1911. The Fields post office was opened two years later. The stone roadhouse was eventually remodeled into a store and restaurant, and is still in use. The original stone horse barn has partly collapsed, but remains in use. Today, the community of Fields consists of a bar, store, cafe, gas station, school, campground, and a few houses.

It was founded in 1993 by Colin Sheldon. History In 1993, a steerning made up of RM of Prince Albert residents was formed. At that time their aim was to ensure a safe and adequate supply of water to their families and operations. PARWU was formed by bylaw through the RMs of Prince Albert, RM of Buckland, and RM of Duck Lake. By 1995, the 120-kilometers of pipeline was completed for the initial 125 subscribers. That water source was vital for area businesses such as hog, beef, and dairy producers, and an oilseed processing operation. The PARWU partnered with the City of Prince Albert as Prince Albert would become the main source for the water. Since the initial pipeline was completed, it has expanded. On November 8, 1996 a signing between the PARWU and Muskoday First Nations took place at the Muskoday Community Hall. The signing was witnessed by chief of Muskoday First Nations Austin Bear, Colin Sheldon who was the chairman of PARWU at the time, then councilor of Prince Albert Lawrence Joseph, Indian Affairs representative Ray Gamercy, plus a number of Muskoday residents. Although Muskoday was notified a year and a half earlier that the pipeline was going in their direction. They were in negotiations until the November 8th signing. The pipeline in Muskoday went towards rectifying the water problem facing the reserve. Water advisories On July 21, 2016, a leak was reported on Husky Energy's 16TAN pipeline where it crosses the North Saskatchewan River near Maidstone, Saskatchewan. The spill effect around 70,000 residents in communities including North Battleford and Prince Albert. The spill effected not only the City of Prince Albert, but also PARWU subscribers. The City of Prince Albert shut off their intake valve in which they got their source of water from the North Saskatchewan River. On August 17, 2019; general manager Ken Danger said PARWU subscribers would receive a \\"break on their bill,\\" but didn't know how it would be done at that time. They still experienced discolouration in their water as crews continued to clean it up. On October 18, 2016, PARWU issued a boil water advisory on the RM of Buckland for precautionary reasons. The day before (October 17), the City of Prince Albert experienced an issue with one of its pipelines near Central Ave. and River St. E.. The water was shut off PARWU in order to fix the issue before it was later turned back on. On November 6, 2016; the precautionary drinking water drinking water advisory for both RMs of Prince Albert and Duck Lake were lifted. PARWU said the system was flushed and the results of the results of the test samples deemed it had returned to acceptable limits.

Luqman (c. 1100 BC) is believed to be from Ethiopia. There are many stories about Luqman in Persian, Arabic and Turkish literature and the primary historical sources are the Tafsir ibn Kathir and Stories of the Qur ºan by Ibn Kathir. The Qur ºan does not state whether Luqman was a prophet, but some people believe him to be a prophet and thus write Alayhis salaam (A.S.) with his name. The Bah√° º√≠ holy writings also make reference to Luqman. Source of Luqman's wisdom Luqman was described as a perceptive man, always watching the animals and plants of his surroundings, who tried to understand the world based on what he saw. One day, whilst he was sleeping under a tree, an angel came to him and told him Allah wanted to bestow a gift upon Luqman and that he can choose one of two: wisdom or being a king. Luqman chose wisdom and when he woke from his slumber, he was aware that his senses and understanding had sharpened. He felt in complete harmony with nature and could understand the inner meaning of things, beyond their physical reality. Immediately, he bowed down, thanked and praised Allah for the wonderful gift. Slavery Luqman was captured by slavers and sold as a slave. He was deprived of his freedom and could neither move nor speak freely. This was the first trial he had to bear. He suffered his bondage patiently, for his heart was lit with faith and hope, and he was waiting for Allah's action. The man who bought him was a good- hearted and intelligent man. He treated Luqman with kindness. He was able to detect that Luqman was not ordinary and tried to test his intelligence. He ordered Luqman to slaughter a sheep and bring its worst part to him. Luqman slaughtered the sheep and took its heart and tongue to his master. On receiving them - his master smiled, fascinated by Luqman's choice of the 'worst'. He understood that Luqman was trying to convey some deep meaning even though he could not make out exactly what. From that moment onwards, his owner began to take more interest in Luqman and became kinder to him than before. A few days later, Luqman was again instructed to slaughter a sheep, but this time he was asked to take the best parts of the animal to the owner. Luqman slaughtered a sheep, and to his master's amazement, again brought the same organs (the heart and the tongue). His master asked Luqman how the heart and the tongue could be both the worst and the best parts. The wise Luqman answered: The tongue and the heart are the sweetest parts if its owner is pure; and if he is wicked, they too are as wicked! Thereafter, Luqman's owner held him in great respect. Luqman was consulted by many people for advice, and the fame of his wisdom spread all over the country. The Hadith teaches that for some bondsmen, a high rank has been determined but sometimes, that bondsman has not acquired the good deeds to reach to such a high rank. Hence, Allah causes him to become involved with some calamity, which if he accepts and bears patiently, he is able to reach that high position. According to the Hadith, when Luqman was teaching, he was asked, \\"What has brought you to be like this?\\" meaning his high rank. Luqman said, \\"Truthful speech, fulfilling the trust, and leaving what does not concern me.\\" On death In the Bah√° º√≠ writings, Luqman presents the following analogy to his son to explain the inevitability of the afterlife: \\"O Son, if thou art able not to sleep, then thou art able not to die. And if thou art able not to waken after sleep, then thou shalt be able not to rise after death.‚Äù Identity of Luqman Luqman was also the name of an Arabian mythical figure long before the Quran. There has been much debate and discussion, theologically and historically, about the relationship of the two characters. Some maintain that it's the same person, others that they simply share the same name. Arabic proverb collections actually fuse the two characters, drawing from both the Quran and pre-Islamic stories, endowing him with superhuman strength and lifespan. The pre-Islamic Luqman was of the Ad people, who lived in Al-Ahqaf in the Arabian peninsula, near modern-day Yemen.The Book of Proverbs and Arabic Proverbial Works, Volume 74 Luqman appears in Arabic tradition as a \\"composite\\" and a \\"many-sided figure\\": (a) The pre-islamic Luqman; (b) The Qur ºanic Luqman; and (c)Luqman of fables.

Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) identified tampering with the BTCL's international call records as one of its major corrupted areas. *Bangladesh's state-owned telecommunications company is refusing to reconnect a British firm to the country's network despite having been ordered to do so by the courts. London- based Zamir Telecom has been cut off from the Bangladesh network since March, causing it significant financial damage. Bangladesh's controversial telecoms minister, Abdul Latif Siddique, has admitted giving the order for the disconnection of Zamir Telecom from the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). This was in breach of a 2010 court order overturning a similar situation. Zamir Telecom successfully challenged BTCL in a Dhaka court in early May when judges ordered the firm's reconnection within 36 hours. But the court order was ignored again. This is purportedly because of an ongoing arbitration process between BTCL and Zamir Telecom over disputed invoicing, despite judges saying the connection must be maintained alongside the talks. *The Anti-Corruption Commission on August 25, 2013 approved filing four cases against 22 people, including Managing Director SOM Kalim Ullah and three other former managing directors of Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited, in connection with embezzling over ‡ß≥5.75bn through illegal Voice over Internet Protocol business.

Credit: Wellcome Library Professor Nathan J. Saltz (Hebrew: , 1912 ‚Äì July 27, 2003) was an American-born Israeli doctor who is considered the father and founder of modern surgical medicine in Israel. Biography He was born in New York City in 1912 and graduated from the Emory University School of Medicine. Following his internship he joined the US Army Medical Corps in 1941, and served as a Battalion surgeon for four years participating in the North African Campaign and the Salerno invasion in Italy. During this time he lost his hearing and was awarded a Purple Heart. He also was awarded three Bronze Stars. After World War II he trained at NY University and was Chief Resident in Surgery at the New York University Bellevue Medical Center. In 1950, he moved to Israel with his wife (Dr. Armen Saltz), settling in Jerusalem, where he practiced medicine at the Hadassah Medical Center. Career From the very beginning, Saltz was recognized as an exceptional physician. His compassion, his thoroughness, and the quality and scope of his clinical knowledge earned him profound respect among his colleagues. Within a few years, Saltz had become the leading surgeon in Israel. In 1961, he was appointed the director of Surgery Department A, and in 1962 he was appointed head of all of the surgery departments at Hadassah Hospital. His appointment as head of surgery began a new era for Israeli surgery. Saltz had two goals: One was to bring modern, academic surgery to Hadassah, and the other was to establish a system of surgical education, similar to that in the United States. According to the American system, the surgeon was responsible not only for the care of the patient, but also for sharing his knowledge and experience with his students. This differed from the European discipline then practiced in Israel, which was based on the personal experience of the seemingly omnipotent head of the surgery department, rather than on clinical research, current medical literature, and the resident's analysis. Thus, Saltz developed a new curriculum for the systematic training of physicians that included clinical consultations, instructions during surgery, formal post-operative assessment, and extensive weekly concilia, and caused the Medical School and its surgical training to become pre-eminent in Israel and renowned abroad. Under his leadership as Professor and Chairman of Surgery, the Hadassah Medical Center became the flagship of clinical surgery in Israel. Through the force of his personality and reputation he gathered the best surgical minds in the country. Most chiefs and heads of surgical services in Israel today are either his trainees or students of. By 1978, over forty department heads and professors of surgery in Israel were his former students. Saltz introduced and spread the principles of trauma care throughout the Israeli civil and military medical systems. Drawing upon his extensive battlefield experience and his thorough understanding of the patho-physiological processes occurring in conditions of trauma, he trained an entire generation of Army physicians in the techniques of field surgery and medical practice under combat conditions. During the Six-Day War, when Hadassah Hospital functioned as a field hospital, Saltz's academic, research, and combat experience was key in the treatment of the hundreds of wounded who packed the hospital's rooms and corridors. He took command, determined triage, chose the necessary surgical interventions, and prioritized patients. Through six endless days and nights, he never forgot a kind word for the wounded and their families, but asked nothing for himself ‚Äì neither a cup of tea nor a moment's rest. The scene was similar during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, except that by then, it was his students who were manning the field hospital at Rephidim in the Sinai Desert. His teaching is the standard today for the Israeli Defense Forces Medical Corps and his methods have been adopted by military medical corps throughout the world. Saltz left the Hadassah Medical Center at the age of 65. A year later, he set up a new surgical department at the Bikur Cholim Hospital in downtown Jerusalem. There he served as head of the department until he retired at the age of 80. He died in Jerusalem on July 27, 2003. Saltz was a beacon for his generation, providing a personal example of steadfast honesty and integrity, never disingenuousness or duplicity. He was utterly committed to his patients in their time of distress. His responsibility was governed by neither the hands of the clock nor the pages of the calendar. In his ceaseless devotion to his patients, he overcame obstacles that other surgeons might have found daunting. He was a senior member of the Henry IV Surgical Association, was a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and Editor in Chief of the Israel Journal of Medicine.  Awards  * In 1978, Saltz was awarded the Israel Prize, for medicine. In their decision, the members of the Israel Prize committee noted that \\"Professor Saltz is outstanding in his honesty and humility, responsibility, humane approach, and willingness to help patients in all extremities. He has cut a shining path for other practitioners of medicine\\". * In 1984, he received the Yakir Yerushalayim (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award from the city of Jerusalem.

Recorded in March 1969, it was released in April, four months before the album, as the B-side of \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", the lead single from Green River. The song describes the plight of a down-and-out musician whose career has landed him playing gigs in the town of Lodi (pronounced \\"low-die\\"), a small agricultural city in California's Central Valley about from Fogerty's hometown of Berkeley. After playing in local bars, the narrator finds himself stranded and unable to raise bus or train fare to leave. Fogerty later said he had never actually visited Lodi before writing this song, and simply picked it for the song because it had \\"the coolest sounding name.\\" However, the song unquestionably references the town's reputation as an uninteresting farm settlement, though the narrator does not make any specific complaints. The song's chorus, \\"Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again,\\" has been the theme of several city events in Lodi. The song's arrangement includes a change of key in the final verse of the track, emphasising the melancholy drama of the lyric, \\"If I only had a dollar for every song I sung....\\" Cover versions The song has been covered by many musicians including Advance Base (Owen Ashwort), Tesla, Emmylou Harris, Amy Ray, Shawn Colvin, Tom Jones, Buck Owens, Jeffrey Foucault, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Ronnie Hawkins, Smokie, Dan Penn, Al Wilson, The Blue Aeroplanes, Tim Armstrong, FIDLAR, Freddie King, the Italian band Stormy Six, Bo Diddley, The Brandos, and Eric Church. Songwriter's assessment Fogerty stated, \\"On 'Lodi', I saw a much older person than I was, 'cause it is sort of a tragic telling. A guy is stuck in a place where people really don't appreciate him. Since I was at the beginning of a good career, I was hoping that that wouldn't happen to me.\\" References External links * Category:1969 singles Category:Songs written by John Fogerty Category:Creedence Clearwater Revival songs Category:John Fogerty songs Category:Lodi, California Category:Song recordings produced by John Fogerty Category:Fantasy Records singles Category:1969 songs ","title":"Lodi (Creedence Clearwater Revival song)"},{"id":"18221382","text":"Alsisar is a small town in the north-western part of Jhunjhunu district, Rajasthan, India.

It is the twelfth game in the Galaxian series, and the third developed for home platforms. The player controls a starship, the AEf-7 \\"Blowneedle\\", in its efforts to wipe out the Galaga armada. The objective of the game is to clear each of the five stages as quick as possible. Stages have a heavy emphasis on puzzle solving and chain reactions, which are necessary to clear out enemy formations. The Blowneedle has a pair of satellites at its disposal, and can place them anywhere on the screen to fend off enemies. Development began in August 2007, headed by director Tadashi Iguchi, with the goal being to iron out many of the flaws present in the original Galaga while offering a brand new gameplay experience. It was created to be appealing for both hardcore shoot'em up players as well as newcomers to the series. The twin-stick gameplay was added to both show off technical capabilities of the next-generation platforms it ran upon, as well as to keep the fundamentals of the original Galaga. Gaplus, the third entry in the series, was a major source of inspiration for the game. Early versions referred to the game as Galaga Evolution Edition. Upon release, Galaga Legions was met with a favorable reception from critics, often being compared to Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. Reviewers applauded the game's visuals, strategic gameplay and addictive nature, although would heave criticism for its high price point and little resemblance to the original. A direct sequel game, titled Galaga Legions DX, was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows Phone in 2011, being the second game under the Namco Generations label. The original game was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2012 as part of the compilation game Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions. Gameplay Xbox 360 version screenshot. Displays the player gunning down a large formation of enemies. Galaga Legions is a twin- stick shooter video game, serving as a modern remake of the original Galaga. The player assumes control of a star ship, the AEf-7 \\"Blowneedle\\", as it must vanquish the Galaga forces before they destroy the human race. The game is divided into five stages, each having four \\"areas\\" - the objective is to complete these areas in the quickest time possible, by destroying all of the enemy formations. Enemies can appear from the top, sides and bottom of the screen, their path being indicated by glowing neon lines. Some enemies will explode when shot and destroy anything around them, which can be used to launch chain reactions. The Blowneedle is equipped with two satellites, capable of shooting at oncoming enemies. The satellites are able to detach from the ship, and can be placed anywhere on the screen to help fend off enemies. Satellites can also be reattached to the Blowneedle if necessary. Some enemy formations will carry a black hole bomb, which when shot causes all enemies on-screen to be sucked in and become allies with the player, similar to the \\"duel fighter\\" mechanic from the original Galaga. The end of each stage has the player face off against a group of \\"boss\\" enemies, which when defeated will allow the player to progress onward. Two gameplay modes are present, \\"Championship\\" and \\"Adventure\\", each having differentiating gameplay rules and mechanics \\\\- Championship is a score attack mode that has the player destroying several waves of enemies, while Adventure places the player through a campaign mode with increasing difficulty and enemy attack patterns. Additionally, the player can equip one of three different skins that alter the game's visual appearance, including one that replaces the player and enemy sprites with those from the original Galaga. An autofire option is also included, as is a replay feature that allows the player to watch a recording of their gameplay from an earlier stage. Development and release Tadashi Iguchi in 2009. Galaga Legions began development in August 2007, headed by director Tadashi Iguchi. Iguchi, who previously worked on Pac-Man Championship Edition, was interested in creating a new game in the series due to the original's massive popularity and recognition. The goal of the project was to iron out the flaws in the original Galaga arcade game, while still offering an exciting gameplay experience new to consoles.\\"Galaga Legions Developer Interview\\". Tadashi Iguchi. Retrieved 19 September 2008. At the start of development, Iguchi and his team broke down many of the elements from Galaga to rework them into the new game, however this would instead be a frustration for developers, with many ideas having to be remade or canned entirely. Several different gameplay styles were tested early on, such as a Xevious-type shooter with ground targets to destroy and a side-scroller with elements from rhythm games - neither of these proved to be successful with playtesters, leading to the game becoming a single-screen shooter akin to the original.NG News Vol. 14. Namco Bandai Games. Retrieved 16 June 2019. Early versions of the game were known as Galaga Evolution Edition. Much of the inspiration for the project was drawn from Gaplus, the third game in the Galaxian series; in this game, enemies would fly into formation from the sides of the screen as well as from the top. Iguchi used this idea to help break the mold of the original, and to be a surprise for players familiar with the enemy movements established in the first game. Gaplus also inspired the eight-directional movement for the player's ship, as well as the enemy-capturing black hole bomb, which also paid homage to the tractor beam idea from Galaga. Stages were created to have puzzle elements, such as which enemy to shoot or which area the player should place their ship. The enemy-indication neon lines were added to keep the game fair for newer players, helping to prevent them from colliding with off-screen enemies. The game was also created to appeal to both hardcore fans and newcomers of the shoot'em up genre of games. Once the basic mechanics of the original were reworked into the project, Iguchi stated that the game should strengthen the strategic element of Galaga and implement new and interesting ideas. The satellites were added to keep the fundamental excitement of the original and show off technological capabilities of next- generation systems. By the end of development, the team had added so many new ideas and mechanics that Iguchi referred to the game as a \\"mutation\\" of Galaga. Galaga Legions was released for both the Xbox 360 worldwide on August 20, 2008. It was one of the nine included Xbox Live Arcade games in Namco Museum Virtual Arcade. It was also packaged into the 2012 Nintendo 3DS game Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions, alongside five other games from the Galaxian and Pac-Man series. Reception Galaga Legions received a favorable response from critics, with praise given to its visuals, addictive gameplay and usage of puzzle-solving. It has an average critic score of 76% on GameRankings and 74/100 on Metacritic. Eurogamer called it a \\"ferociously addictive and forward-thinking shoot-'em-up\\", while 1UP.com labeled it \\"one of the most fiercely competitive multiplayer games on XBLA\\", praising its addictive nature. 1UP also compared the game's quality to shoot'em up games by Capcom and Treasure. Giant Bomb called it \\"an interesting and unique take on static- screen shooters\\". The addition of satellites was also praised - IGN called it a \\"great addition\\" to the game for adding a sense of strategy, which both Eurogamer and GameSpot also applauded. 1UP also praised its use of puzzle- solving for the \\"sense of achievement\\" it brings. The game's visuals were highly praised; IGN labeled it as one of the best-looking games on Xbox Live Arcade, particularly praising its detailed backgrounds, while 1UP and Eurogamer compared the graphics favorably to those in Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. GameSpot applauded its techno soundtrack and sound effects for staying true to the original. Despite its praise, many would criticize the game's little resemblance to the original Galaga alongside its high price point. Giant Bomb was particularly negative, stating it \\"doesn't do a very good job\\" at being a successor to the original for having very little to do with Galaga. IGN disliked the game's high price point, saying the little amount of content didn't justify its $10 price tag, as well as criticizing the selectable skins for simply being cosmetic. While GameSpot criticized the game's lack of multiplayer modes, 1UP would contest this, writing \\"once you start playing, it's easy to understand why this game doesn't really need 'em.\\" Sequel A direct sequel to the game, Galaga Legions DX, was released in 2011 for both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and later for Windows Phone in 2012. It was released as part of the Namco Generations label, which was used for remakes of older Namco video games. The sequel adds several new features to the original game, such as a slowdown effect when near enemies, boss enemies that wipe out entire enemy formations, and score attack competitions held periodically by Bandai Namco for a short time. It was added to the Xbox One's backwards comparability lineup in 2016.

BKS was founded by Dattopant Thengadi in 1978. As of 2000, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh claimed BKS had a quarter million members, organized in 11,000 villages and 301 districts across the country. The organization is dominated by landed gentry. Founding The first chapter of BKS to be formed was its Rajasthan branch, founded on 13 March 1978. The all India organization of BKS was announced by Thengadi on 4 March 1979 at the first All India Conference of BKS in Kota. The 650 delegates at the 1979 conference had been handpicked by Thengadi, who travelled across the country to meet with farmers' representatives. The launch of BKS was preceded by earlier efforts of RSS to organize the peasantry. In the 1960s, RSS had organized farmers in the Vidharba region, and again in 1972 in Uttar Pradesh. The RSS effort to build an agrarian front, parallel to Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh trade union movement, had however failed to attract major mass support. 1980s On 26 February 1981 the BKS held a mass rally at the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly in Hyderabad, the first major farmers mobilization after the Green Revolution. The organizing of peasants in areas of Andhra Pradesh such as Karimnagar District, Nizamabad District and Warangal District led to tensions with the dominant Naxal movement in the area, and in February 1984 BKS Karimnagar District Secretary Gopal Reddy and Ramchander Rao (a RSS taluk- level organizer) were killed in Jagityal. In July 1985 BKS organized a mass rally at the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, a protest movement that forced the state government to lower electricity prices. In 1986‚Äì1987 BKS led a mass movement in Gujarat, culminating in a violent gherao of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly in March 1987. The campaign began in October 1986, following two years of drought in the state. On 1 January 1987 a mass rally of 400,000 people was held in Vijaypur. The movement culminated in the gherao of the Legislative Assembly, at which police fire killed four demonstrators at the 19 March 1987 gherao, and one police officer was killed by the demonstrators. The BKS leadership was arrested and the organization declared an indefinite state-wide bandh following the clashes. The 1986‚Äì1987 Gujarat movement was marked by a competition between BKS (based mainly in northern Gujarat, with some influence in central Gujarat) and the Khedut Samaj and Kisan Sanghatana (based in south Gujarat). Whilst the movement had a larger charter of demands, its key demand was the lowering of electricity prices for farmers. BJP supported the BKS agitation, as means of countering the influence of Sharad Joshi in the state. Later history With its base among wealthier farmers, BKS supported the privatization of inputs and increased mechanization of agriculture in the 1990s. In Gujarat BKS became primarily dominated by cotton farmers, an export-oriented cash crop. BKS held its sixth national conference in Hastinapur in 1999, addressed by RSS sarsanghchalak Rajendra Singh. At the time, Kunvarji Bhai Jadhav, was the BKS president. Political line BKS describes itself as an apolitical organization, and its by-laws indicate that the BKS banner is ochre colour (rather than the nearly identical saffron colour of the RSS banner). The organization describes itself as an organization 'by farmers, for farmers', promoting agricultural self-reliance. Organizers of BKS are generally RSS members or sympathizers, its leader is largely pro-Bharatiya Janata Party. The motto of the organization, in Sanskrit, is 'Krithi Mit Krishwa' ('Do farming yourself'), taken from the Rig Veda. The organization opposes genetically modified crops in oilseed production.The Hindu. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh opposes GM tech in oilseeds Whilst politically close to BJP, its relations with the party hasn't always been uncomplicated. When Narendra Modi, as Chief Minister of Gujarat, increased electricity prices in 2003 the BKS launched a protest movement against the BJP government, with a 50,000 strong protest in Gandhinagar.Indian Express. The return of kisan politics The BJP responded by evicting the BKS from its state headquarters at the Members of Legislative Assembly quarters. The RSS intervened, trying to reconcile BKS and BJP in the state. But in Gujarat BKS refused to support BJP in the 2004 Indian general election. In 2007, the BKS showed resentment with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Gujarat. Dissatisfied with the prevailing cotton prices, it led to farmers' agitation in Saurashtra. In September 2020, the BKS also protested against the agriculture bills passed by the Parliament and asked for modifications to the bill.

His father was a car painter and a custodian of the theater in Nymburk and sometimes worked as an actor and director where young Miroslav could experience many famous Czech actors who were guests in the theater.Miroslav Mach√°ƒçek: Z√°pisky z bl√°zince, His father enrolled Miroslav in a high school, but he was expelled after few years and had to return to an elementary school. After graduation, he went to a trade high school where he learned to become a hammerman in the Aero factory. During his studies he took part in evening theater rehearsals in Prague and met in person some famous actors such as Ji≈ô√≠ Sov√°k, Martin R≈Ø≈æek, V√°clav Voska etc. He decided to try to enroll into a Theatre College, he passed the admission exam but all of this happened at the time when the higher level schools in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were closing down. He entered the school after the war (Milo≈° Nedbal was his teacherCzech and Slovak Movie Database, ) and graduated in 1948. At the time of his studies he was so poor that he had to sleep in the college building (Rudolfinum) but later he lived with his colleagues (e.g. Stanislav Remunda). After graduation, he worked in the Pardubice Theater and in 1950 he moved to Prague and started working for Realist Theater and DAMU (Theater Conservatory). A year later he was accused of revolting and spy contacts and was fired from the Theater as well as from the College. He had to write an obligatory heart-searching confession. As a consequence he suffered from depression and even tried to commit suicide, but eventually left Prague for ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice to work in the local Theatre. In 1956 (the time of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) he returned to Prague and in 1959 he started his career in the most prestigious Theater in the country ‚Äì National Theater. He was a constituent member of the ƒåinohern√≠ klub (1965). In April 1969 he left the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and had much trouble with secret police that constantly intruded and interrupted his professional work as a theater director and an actor. Among others in the National Theater in Prague he successfully staged Shakespeare's Henry V; his success was remarkable because audience rightfully understood this play was making fun of communists.

As a punishment he had to stop working for Czech Television and was no longer allowed to participate on a work on movies. Non the less he managed to successfully stage twenty nine plays from different drama authors. He also contributed as an actor, where he played in over thirty roles, often in dramas he directed. In 1975 he made a critical speech in the National Theatre (after the Opening Night of the Optimistic Tragedy by Vsevolod VishnevskiyReflex 41/2007, ) and as a result of his disregard for the communist government he was forced by authorities to begin a treatment in a Psychiatric Asylum in Bohnice where he spent 117 days.Jind≈ôich Pokorn√Ω: Pamƒõ≈• divadeln√≠kova a bl√°zinec doby, in: Revolver Revue, 3/1995 After his dismissal he came back to National Theatre and directed most of his masterpieces, among them Na≈°i Furianti by Ladislav Stroupe≈ænick√Ω (Opening Night on 13 May 1979), often considered to be the best staging of the Czechoslovak Theater in a post-war history. He retired on 1 January 1989 but he took actively part in the Velvet Revolution.

Wylie, was an Australian-British-American novelist, screenwriter, short story writer, and poet and suffragette sympathiser, who was honored by the journalistic and literary establishments of her time, and was known around the world. Between 1915 and 1953, more than thirty of her novels and stories were adapted into films, including Keeper of the Flame (1942), which was directed by George Cukor and starred Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Biography =Early life= Wylie was born Ida Alexa Ross Wylie on 16 March 1885 in Melbourne, Australia to Alexander Coghill Wylie (1852‚Äì1910) from England and Ida Millicent Ross (1855‚Äì1890), a farmer's daughter from Australia. I.A.R. Wylie's father, Alec Wylie of Glasgow, Scotland, was in debt much of his life and often on the move from creditors. And so it was that sometime in the 1880s, after failing to be elected as an MP, he fled the UK for Australia, but not before his first wife divorced him in 1883 for adultery and violence, winning custody of their two children and also proposing to her sister, Christine (who refused). In Australia, he soon married a plain farmer's daughter named Ida Ross. The couple's first child, I.A.R. Wylie, was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1885, literally named after her parents: Ida Ross and Alec Wylie. In 1888, Alec moved back to London with his new wife and young child, but Ida Ross died shortly thereafter. According to Ida's book Life with George an \\"unconventional autobiography\\" - Alec then renewed relations with Christine, his first wife's sister, and Christine became the young Wylie's home school teacher and guardian, raising her while her father struggled from one crisis to the next. At one point, young Ida briefly attended Cheltenham Ladies College. In terms of influence on her development, \\"Christine was just the first of a line of women who proved far stronger and more reliable than any man in Ida's life.\\" However, marriage records show Wylie's third marriage was to Adela Maude B de Burgh Lawson, daughter of Sir Henry de Burgh Lawson of Gatherley Castle; it may be Adela who is Christine (Wylie's first marriage was to Emillie Isabel Roumieu). =Early writing career= Ida R. Wylie After spending three years in finishing school in Belgium, Wylie first studied in England, and later in Germany, where she also taught and began writing. Wylie's self-education at home meant she spent many hours making up her own stories to fill up time, and, at the age of 19, she sold her first short story to a magazine. For example, Wylie had a roommate named Esme who had been raised in India and so she wrote stories based on Esme's reminisces. Wylie went on to write at least five books based in India, The Native Born, or, The Rajah's People (1910); The Daughter of Brahma (1913); Tristram Sahib (1915); The Temple of Dawn (1915); and The Hermit Doctor of Gaya (1916). While living in Germany in the early 1910s, she wrote a number of books including My German Year (1910); Rambles in the Black Forest (1911); The Germans (1911); and Eight Years in Germany (1914). Her novel, Towards Morning (1918), was \\"perhaps the first in English to suggest that not all Germans were evil imperialists.\\" = Role in suffragette movement = In 1911, Wylie returned to England, living in St John's Wood, London, and joined the suffragette movement. She provided a safe house for women who were released from prison where they could recover from hunger strikes under the \\"Cat and Mouse Act\\" without being watched by the police. She struck up a relationship with the editor of \\"The Suffragette\\", Rachel Barrett, and by mid 1913 was a useful \\"sub-editor and bottle-washer\\". She traveled with Annie and Jessie Kenney and Mary Richardson to spend a week in France with Christabel Pankhurst. Wylie and Barrett then traveled to Edinburgh to Wylie's aunt Jane, where Barrett had surgery and lived under a pseudonym to avoid re-arrest. Both returned to London for Christmas 1913, and continued to secretly edit The Suffragette until May 1914 when police again raided the premises in Lincoln's Inn. In 1917, Barrett and Wylie traveled to America. They bought a car and roamed around the country, from New York to San Francisco, a remarkable journey with the state of roads and cars at the time. =Hollywood= Wylie eventually settled in Hollywood where she sold her stories. Over 30 movies were made from 1915 to 1953 based on her works, including Torch Song (1953) and Phone Call from a Stranger (1952). Her story \\"Grandmother Bernle Learns Her Letters\\", published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1926, was filmed twice‚Äîby John Ford in 1928 as Four Sons, and by Archie Mayo in 1940, also as Four Sons. She is probably best known as the author of the novel that became the basis of the film Keeper of the Flame (1942), directed by George Cukor and starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. =Personal life= I. A. R. Wylie, December 1928. Photo: Arnold Genthe Wylie became involved with physician Sara Josephine Baker. Neither Baker nor Wylie ever declared themselves openly as lesbians, but according to Dr. Bert Hansen, the two women were partners.\\" Other authors have identified her as a lesbian, including Laura Doan, Anne McMay, and Barbara Grier. In her autobiography My Life with George, in which the \\"George\\" of the title is her subconscious ego, Wylie says: > I have always liked women better than men. I am more at ease with them and > more amused by them. I too am rather bored by a conventional relationship > which seems to involve either my playing up to someone or playing down to > someone. Here and there and especially in my latter years when there should > be no further danger of my trying to ensnare one of them I have established > some real friendships with men in which we meet and like each other on equal > terms as human beings. But fortunately, I have never wanted to marry any of > them, nor with the exception of that one misguided German Grenadier, have > any of them wanted to marry me.Ida Alexa Ross Wylie. My Life with George In her autobiography she acknowledges that many of her women friends refer to her as \\"Uncle,\\" and as one critic says, her choice of being credited as \\"I.A.R. Wylie\\" instead of Ida Wylie was certainly an attempt to downplay her gender in publications.Dr. Bert Hansen. \\"Public Careers and Private Sexuality: Some Gay and Lesbian Lives in the History of Medicine and Public Health\\" In the 1930s, Wylie, Sara Josephine Baker, and another pioneering woman physician, Dr. Louise Pearce, settled on a property near Skillman, New Jersey named Trevenna Farm. They lived there together until Baker died in 1945, followed by Pearce, and then later Wylie, who died on 4 November 1959 at the age of 74. Wylie and Pearce are buried alongside each other at Henry Skillman Burying Ground, Trevenna Farm's family cemetery.

With implementation of modern technologies, issues including credit, intellectual property, trade and commerce related to agricultural products are dealt within the sphere of this law. Simply put, agricultural law is the study of the special laws and regulations that apply to the production and sale of agricultural products. \\"Agricultural exceptionalism,\\" i.e., the use of legal exceptions to protect the agricultural industry, is pervasive, worldwide. American law schools and legal scholars first recognized agricultural law as a discipline in the 1940s when law schools at Yale, Harvard, Texas, and Iowa explored and initiated agricultural law courses. These early efforts were short-lived, however, and agricultural law as a distinct discipline did not resurface for three decades. In 1979, a scholarly journal, The Agricultural Law Journal was initiated. In 1980, the American Agricultural Law Association was formed and an advanced law degree program, the LL.M. Program in Agricultural Law was founded at the University of Arkansas School of Law. In 1981, a fifteen volume Agricultural Law Treatise was published and in 1985, the first law school casebook, Agricultural Law: Cases and Materials was published by West Publishing. In recent years, agricultural law studies have expanded to incorporate a wider consideration of the impact of agricultural production, including issues of environmental law, sustainability, animal welfare, and food law and policy. Reflecting this expanded perspective, in 2009, the LL.M. Program in Agricultural Law at Arkansas changed its name to the LL.M Program in Agricultural and Food Law. In 2010, the second law school textbook was published with the title, Food, Farming & Sustainability: Readings in Agricultural Law. And, in 2012, the American Association of Law Schools changed the name of its Agricultural Law section to Agricultural and Food Law. The emerging discipline of food law & policy traces its roots to the discipline of agricultural law as well as tradition food and drug law.

July 2019 is the Festival's 40th edition. The four-day Calgary Folk Music Festival annually features over 68 icons and upstarts from 16 countries on 11 stages in over 100 distinct concert and collaborative programming performances to a 52,000+ audience the 4th weekend of July at Prince's Island Park. A genre- bending affair, it features roots, funk, country, old-time, world and indie icons and upstarts from around the globe. Ever-evolving programming brings on- the-fly collaborations where musical arranged marriages spark one-time works of art. Workshops A popular feature of the Calgary Folk Music Festival is the inclusion of workshops into its programming. Workshops take place throughout the day on Saturday and Sunday across the six side stages. The workshops, also known as \\"jams\\" or \\"sessions\\" involve four to five festival artists playing together on the same stage. Often centered around a theme, some workshops feature acts of similar style, while others may feature artists of different genres. Artists generally take turns playing on each other's songs, or improvising in a \\"jam\\" format. Folk Boot Camp In addition to the main festival on Prince's Island Park, the Calgary Folk Music Festival runs a series of three-day intensive workshops at the National Music Centre, taught by festival artists in such areas as songwriting, arranging, vocal techniques and guitar. The three-day sessions allow the instructor and participants to develop their skills and receive constructive feedback from the instructor and peers. Folk Boot Camp is geared towards musicians that have a basic grasp of their craft and want to supplement their own studies with guidance from some of the world's finest musicians. Songwriting Contest The Calgary Folk Music Festival also holds an annual songwriting context prior to the festival. The contest awards $20,000 of prizes in 5 songwriting categories to budding Alberta artists and many large and small concerts in venues around the city. 2016's Songwriting contest will be hosted exclusively by the Ship and Anchor pub.  Block Heater  The Calgary Folk Music Festival presented the inaugural edition of Block Heater, a winter music extravaganza February 12‚Äì14, 2016 at three live music venues on the Music Mile in the historic community of Inglewood. Throughout the Family Day long weekend, over 20 local, national and international artists performed concerts and collaborative songwriter-in-the- round sessions at Festival Hall (1215 10 Avenue SE), the Inglewood Music Club (1401 10 Ave SE) and Ironwood Stage and Grill (1229 9 Ave SE). Festival Hall Festival Hall is the Calgary Folk Music Festival's new office and boutique performance space. The LEEDS Silver equivalent 200-seat flexible community space, designed by Peter Cardew Architects, includes geo-thermal passive heating and cooling systems, reclaimed materials and significant architectural details, such as the signature timbered ceiling. Festival Hall's overriding programming and vision will mirror the Festival's: to offer diverse, top-notch, innovative, collaborative programming and capture the sense of ownership that the audience and volunteers have towards the Festival. The Hall extends the Festival into a year-round operation as the host of year- round concerts, multi-media presentations, collaborations and workshops. It's also a meeting space for the Festival's 1600 volunteers, a community space for event rentals and a multi-purpose, multi-disciplinary home for Calgary's arts community. It will be an active, significant central gathering place for artists to perform, collaborate and innovate that hosts artistic workshops, discussions, lectures, song contests, master classes and other presentations for a variety of community organizations and a wide range of artistic disciplines (film, theatre, media and literary arts, dance etc.).

Organization of these meets can range from \\"professional\\" to almost disorganized.King5 story Some meets are so small that only a couple of people put the whole thing on. It's all based on the simple philosophy of the sport; it only takes two people to hold a race. The formal elements required are a place for the race to take place, and neutral officials to start and judge the finish of a race. Multiply that by dozens to hundreds of participants participating over the spectrum of Track and Field events and you have a meet. All Comers Track Meets have been long standing traditions held in most major cities across the United States and Canada. Some series have a history going back over 50 years. There are generally two seasons when these occur, those seasons being outside of the formal scholastic season. There is a Winter season (Indoors in most areas but outdoors in warmer areas like California and Florida) starting in December and going through the end of February (when scholastic seasons begin); and a Summer season that starts around the beginning of June and goes into August. Some meets, perhaps without the All Comers moniker, do occur during the scholastic season with the specific intent of providing athletes an additional attempt to achieve qualifying times for post season meets.USANTC event list http://www.usantc.com/event_list.php?&eventid;=323 Generally the September to November time period is considered Cross Country season in Track circles, which parallels with Football season at the stadiums where a track meet might be held, so All Comers meets during that period are rare. A regularly updated listing of such meets is kept on the directory North American All Comers Meet Directory. In June 2009, this site listed over fifty active All Comer Track Meet series in North America. The phrase \\"All Comers\\" literally means anybody who shows up is welcome to participate. Meets using the actual term occur in North America, Oceana and English speaking Asia. On various ends of the spectrum, that has meant 3-year-old children, 100-year-old Senior Athletes, \\"Special\\" athletes or Olympic level elite athletes. Fortune Gordien set the world record in the Discus throw at a 1953 All-comers meet in Pasadena, California that lasted almost 6 years. Guinness Book of Track and Field: Facts and Feats called the audience of 48, the smallest crowd ever to witness a world record. In order to create the best circumstances for each athlete, most events are seeded. Some meets are formally organized with all races prepared by registering hours or days in advance, some just break people up by their age groups, less formal meets might just ask the athletes standing at the start line how fast they plan on running. Don't be surprised if the Olympic Champion or World Record Holder squeezes through the crowd to take a center lane in the \\"fast\\" race, but a meet could also be totally dominated by children under 14. Each meet can choose to limit or define the events they wish to hold, some limited to running events, sprints, jumps or throws.Sports Illustrated Occasionally meets are called \\"All Comers\\" but are actually limited by the age groups served or have qualifying standards that entrants must have achieved in order to enter. Many of those requirements are set because of the limitations of the facilities or the number of volunteers available. Most of the people who serve as meet organizers bend over backwards to hold events that have a demand, meaning if you have a bunch of people who want to do something special this is probably the best venue to ask to do it.

Along with Alanya, Aytap is situated in the district of the Antalya Province. Where Aytap is situated there is a long modern road that stretches along the coast between Alanya and Gazipa≈üa. Aytap is situated between Alanya and Gazipa≈üa. Nowadays, Aytap is a popular tourist place. The city is popular for camping; swimming in the natural caves; swimming and using the local beaches or if tourists come to visit the ancient ruins. History Prior to the 1st century, there is no archaeological evidence found that Aytap could have been earlier inhabited by other clans of people. The city was founded by the King Antiochus IV of Commagene, who was of Armenian, Greek and Median descent. Antiochus IV founded this settlement around 52 and named the city in honor of his late sister-wife, Queen of Commagene Iotapa, who was Queen from 38 until her death around 52 of Commagene. Antiochus IV chose this site to establish the city, because there are 2 bays close to each other, giving shape of a natural harbor with a higher plateau for the town to be protected from the sea and any invasions from the sea. The natural port measures 50‚Äì100 metres. The peninsula between the 2 bays is on a high hill, which is connected to land and extends to the sea. In the peninsula, ruins remains of an Acropolis. Huge walls were built around the Acropolis to protect the monument. It is known during the reign of Antiochus IV, 38‚Äì72, in some cities in Cilicia, including Iotapa, mints were producing coins honoring Antiochus‚Äô sons with Iotapa, princes Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes and Callinicus. These mints were producing coins honoring Iotapa, years after her death. Although Iotapa was annexed along with the Kingdom of Commagene by Roman Emperor Vespasian in 72, Iotapa became a central city where coins were minted. From the reign of Trajan (98-117) until the reign of Valerian (253-260), coins were minted at Iotapa. Surviving coins from the mint, on the front side shows the bust of an emperor and backside there is a description of either Apollo, Tyche or Perseus.  Archaeological remains  In Aytap, there are archaeological remains from the reign of Antiochus IV, Ancient Rome and Byzantine Empire. The ancient ruins are near the modern road. In Aytap, there are remains of the Ancient Roman sewers, which are well preserved. In the northern hills of Aytap, there is a necropolis (see List of necropoleis). There are monumental tombs and beside them are small tomb structures covered with vaults. In the old street of Aytap there are well preserve remains of the local Roman Baths. There are crepes consisting of three steps and surviving sculptures. Inscriptions on sculptures have survived about local athletes and local citizens. East of the local Acropolis, there is a Basilica in a rectangular shape with three naves. Ruins of a temple have been found in the modern city centre that is 8 m x 12.5 m long, with traces of surviving frescoes.

Plot Most people want to have a good-looking date for their high school reunion, but four guys with more at stake than just pride scramble to find the right girl for the occasion in this comedy. Max (Hooks), Drew (Darryl Brunson), and Jelly Roll (Christopher Richards) have been close friends since high school.

It is also described as a running wheelW√∂rterbuch der Industriellen Technik, Dr.-Ing. Richard Ernst, Oscar Brandstetter Verlag, Wiesbaden, 5. Auflage, 1989, . and their axle may be called a carrying axle. A carrying wheel is referred to as leading wheel if it is at the front, or a trailing wheel if it is at the rear of the locomotive. Weight distribution In particular reference to steam engines, the carrying wheels have a very important purpose of allowing the engine's weight distribution to be altered. For example in the use of leading wheels it would allow the boiler to be located further forward of the driving wheels, the weight of which counters the leverage imposed by the drawbar and the load of the pulled wagons/cars about the fulcrum of the rearmost driving wheel. Similarly the trailing wheels can move the fulcrum to the rearmost trailing wheel. Such change can dramatically improve the operating speeds of engines and their tractive effort.

The top produces an incorrect result with unordered alpha blending, while the bottom correctly sorts the geometry. Note lower visibility of the skeletal structure without correct depth ordering. Image from ATI Mecha Demo Order-independent transparency (OIT) is a class of techniques in rasterisational computer graphics for rendering transparency in a 3D scene, which do not require rendering geometry in sorted order for alpha compositing. Description Commonly, 3D geometry with transparency is rendered by blending (using alpha compositing) all surfaces into a single buffer (think of this as a canvas). Each surface occludes existing color and adds some of its own color depending on its alpha value, a ratio of light transmittance. The order in which surfaces are blended affects the total occlusion or visibility of each surface. For a correct result, surfaces must be blended from farthest to nearest or nearest to farthest, depending on the alpha compositing operation, over or under. Ordering may be achieved by rendering the geometry in sorted order, for example sorting triangles by depth, but can take a significant amount of time, not always produce a solution (in the case of intersecting or circularly overlapping geometry) and the implementation is complex. Instead, order-independent transparency sorts geometry per-pixel, after rasterisation. For exact results this requires storing all fragments before sorting and compositing. History The A-BufferLoren Carpenter. \\"The A-buffer, an Antialiased Hidden Surface Method\\", SIGGRAPH '84 Proceedings of the 11th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques Pages 103-108, July, 1984 is a computer graphics technique introduced in 1984 which stores per-pixel lists of fragment data (including micro-polygon information) in a software rasteriser, REYES, originally designed for anti-aliasing but also supporting transparency. More recently, depth peeling in 2001 described a hardware accelerated OIT technique. With limitations in graphics hardware the scene's geometry had to be rendered many times. A number of techniques have followed, to improve on the performance of depth peeling, still with the many-pass rendering limitation. For example, Dual Depth Peeling (2008). In 2009, two significant features were introduced in GPU hardware/drivers/Graphics APIs that allowed capturing and storing fragment data in a single rendering pass of the scene, something not previously possible. These are, the ability to write to arbitrary GPU memory from shaders and atomic operations. With these features a new class of OIT techniques became possible that do not require many rendering passes of the scene's geometry. * The first was storing the fragment data in a 3D array,Fang Liu, Meng-Cheng Huang, Xue-Hui Liu, and En-Hua Wu. \\"Single pass depth peeling via CUDA rasterizer\\", In SIGGRAPH 2009: Talks (SIGGRAPH '09), 2009 where fragments are stored along the z dimension for each pixel x/y. In practice, most of the 3D array is unused or overflows, as a scene's depth complexity is typically uneven. To avoid overflow the 3D array requires large amounts of memory, which in many cases is impractical. * Two approaches to reducing this memory overhead exist. *# Packing the 3D array with a prefix sum scan, or linearizing,Craig Peeper. \\"Prefix sum pass to linearize A-buffer storage\\", Patent application, Dec, 2008 removed the unused memory issue but requires an additional depth complexity computation rendering pass of the geometry.

Yang, Justin Hensley, Holger Gr√ºn, and Nicolas Thibieroz. \\"Real- time concurrent linked list construction on the GPU\\", In Proceedings of the 21st Eurographics conference on Rendering (EGSR'10), 2010 provides tight packing of this data and in late 2011, driver improvements reduced the atomic operation contention overhead making the technique very competitive. Exact OIT Exact, as opposed to approximate, OIT accurately computes the final color, for which all fragments must be sorted. For high depth complexity scenes, sorting becomes the bottleneck. One issue with the sorting stage is local memory limited occupancy, in this case a SIMT attribute relating to the throughput and operation latency hiding of GPUs. Backwards memory allocation (BMA) groups pixels by their depth complexity and sorts them in batches to improve the occupancy and hence performance of low depth complexity pixels in the context of a potentially high depth complexity scene. Up to a 3√ó overall OIT performance increase is reported. Sorting is typically performed in a local array, however performance can be improved further by making use of the GPU's memory hierarchy and sorting in registers, similarly to an external merge sort, especially in conjunction with BMA. Approximate OIT Approximate OIT techniques relax the constraint of exact rendering to provide faster results. Higher performance can be gained from not having to store all fragments or only partially sorting the geometry. A number of techniques also compress, or reduce, the fragment data. These include: * Stochastic Transparency: draw in a higher resolution in full opacity but discard some fragments. Downsampling will then yield transparency. * Adaptive Transparency, a two-pass technique where the first constructs a visibility function which compresses on the fly (this compression avoids having to fully sort the fragments) and the second uses this data to composite unordered fragments. Intel's pixel synchronization avoids the need to store all fragments, removing the unbounded memory requirement of many other OIT techniques.

Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art)Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art) 2Teo Spiller Nice Page (net.art)Teo Spiller Capriccess for Netscape (net.art) In 2000 Spiller organized an international art event called INFOS 2000. This was an offline net.art contest addressing how new multimedia has contextually and aesthetically obscured the borders between net.art and CD-ROM art. He also produced many fine art works reflecting the aesthetics of new media. In 2004 Spiller launched X-lam, a different media for viewing images, in collaboration with Tadej Komavec. It works best in low-light conditions. A 'stick' contains a series of blinking diodes; by moving the eyes quickly the viewer can briefly see an image floating in open space. Spiller exhibited X-lam at the 10th Cairo International Biennale, alongside other viewing technologies like stereograms and streaming textuality, which he later used in the installation Intruders (Kino Siska, 2012). In 2007 Spiller declined to participate in the U3 Triennial of Contemporary Arts due to conflicting ideas concerning the presentation of net.art in a gallery. In 2008 Spiller launched Real3Dfriend, a project that questions the ethics of virtual-reality worlds such as Second Life and critiques virtual-reality systems for being too commercial and lacking basis in humanist values. In 2011 Spiller launched projects in new media textuality and new media semiotics, which combined the artist's writing with net.art projects like SPAM sonnet and news sonnets. Combining visual media and machinery, Spiller built the robot Laboro to explore the concept of cyborg artistry (a combination of human and machinery within the artistic process).

Tenant and landlord Although a tacksman generally paid a yearly rent for the land let to him (his \\"tack\\"), his tenure might last for several generations. He would often be related to his landlord and might, for example, represent a cadet branch of the family of the clan chief. The tacksman in turn would let out his land to sub-tenants, but he might keep some in hand himself. Dr Johnson defined the class in this manner: The three fundamental obligations traditionally imposed on tacksmen were grassum (a premium payable on entering into a lease), rental (either in kind, or in money, which was designated \\"tack-duty\\"), and the rendering of military service.Alexander Nicholson, History of Skye (3rd edition, Islands Book Trust, 2012), at pages 127 to 128. Inheritance As described by James Mitchell: This system began to break down by the early 18th century. In 1737, Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll decreed that tacks were to be let out to the highest bidder rather than being given to a tacksman with family connections, consequently many of the older sort of tacksmen were dispossessed. Because they mustered the tenants, acted as officers and functioned as shock troops in time of war, Argyll had inadvertently weakened his military position and that of the Hanoverians in the 1745 Jacobite Rising.Hunter, James (1999)., Last of the free: a millennial history of the Highlands and islands of Scotland., Mainstream Pub However, his rival Donald Cameron of Lochiel maintained the old arrangements with tacksmen. As a consequence the Camerons--who sided with the Jacobites--possessed an enhanced potential to take a military initiative. Reputation The tacksman‚Äôs reputation was an ambiguous one. To some, he appeared to be no more than a parasitic middleman, but Dr Johnson mounted a stout defence: Decline The class of tacksmen was most prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Highland Clearances destroyed the tacksman system ‚Äì perhaps more thoroughly than they did the crofters ‚Äì and many tacksmen emigrated to the New World. Notable tacksmen *Flora MacDonald was a notable and characteristic member of the tacksman class. She was the daughter of Ranald MacDonald, who held the tack of Milton in South Uist from the chief of Clanranald, and she married Allan MacDonald, who held the tack of Kingsburgh from the Chief of Clan MacDonald of Sleat. She and her husband emigrated to North Carolina in 1773. After siding with King George III of England during the American War of Independence, Flora and her husband were forced to move, first to Nova Scotia, and then back to Scotland. She had numerous sons. *Aonghas Beag MacDonald, the older brother of the Scottish Gaelic Bard Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, held the tack of Dalilea from the Chief of Clanranald.

The project's name is a portmanteau of \\"Iberia\\" and the Latin word civis, meaning \\"citizen\\". On April 2020, the distributed computing platform was restarted by the Ibercivis Foundation and the Spanish National Research Council in order to screen existing drugs for antiviral activity against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. History Ibercivis was developed in Spain with the cooperation of the Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Zaragoza, CIEMAT, CETA-CIEMAT, the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and RedIris. The project tasks are issued by different scientific and technological centers in Spain with the aim of creating a functional platform for volunteer-based scientific distributed computing. The project is a European counterpart to the successful United States-based SETI@home and Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) distributed computing projects. Ibercivis' predecessor, the University of Zaragoza-based distributed computing project Zivis, began operation in 2007, and Ibercivis itself started operating in June 2008. The Zivis project was a local distributed computing application funded by the ayuntamiento (city council) of the city of Zaragoza. The larger-scale Ibercivis infrastructure has been used for a variety of calculating applications, including nuclear fusion research, protein folding and materials simulations. In July 2009, the Ibercivis platform was extended to Portugal following an agreement signed by the governments of both countries during the Luso-Spanish Summit held in Zamora, Spain, in January 2009. Several Portuguese institutions subsequently affiliated themselves with Ibercivis, including the Ministry of Science, the Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology at the University of Coimbra, and the LIP experimental high-energy physics laboratory. On April 2020, a new Ibercivis project was launched to support researchers efforts to fight Coronavirus disease 2019. =Number of participants= At its inception in June 2008, Ibercivis had 3,000 registered users hosting its various projects. By December 2012, this figure had risen to over 19,800, distributed across 124 countries. There were around 55,000 individual hosting devices registered with the project, of which over 3,600 were active on a weekly basis. As of April 2020, there were 917 active users and 2375 active hosts in the new inception of Ibercivis. Projects Ibercivis is intended to run indefinitely, and is designed to run several simultaneous applications belonging to different scientific disciplines, in a manner similar to the IBM-funded World Community Grid.

The ITER project, which will begin operation in 2018, seeks to make nuclear fusion power a reality, replicating on Earth conditions typically found inside stars. * Docking: looking for anti-cancer drugs: the Docking application assisted the search for new medicines through the simulation of protein docking. The Bioinformatics Unit of the Centro de Biolog√≠a Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC- UAM) developed a platform to allow the automatic simulation of interactions of proteins and small molecules. Its purpose was to find effective drugs to treat serious illnesses, such as cancer. * Materials: simulation of magnetic systems: the Materials application aided physicists from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Universidad de Extremadura and the Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems in discovering how non-magnetic impurities in magnetic materials modify the properties of their transition from a magnetic state to a non-magnetic one. The knowledge of these transitions is important not only from a theoretical point of view but also may help develop many fields of technology, such as magnetic hard disks and superconducting materials. * Nanoluz: light at a nanoscale: knowing how light reacts at a nanometer scale is a scientific challenge with important implications for the construction of new materials, development of new computing and communication systems and the improvement of technologies such as solar panels. Using the Nanoluz application, scientists at the Institute of Optics Daza Vald√©s CSIC investigated the behavior of light in metal nanoparticles, seeking to develop systems that could simplify medical and biological analysis. * IberNet: let's research inside Ibercivis: with this project, researchers sought to study and represent the structure of Ibercivis as a social network and try to export their conclusions to other social networks, to help with the study and prediction of the dynamics of a mass social environment. *Amiloide: searching for drugs against neurodegenerative amyloid diseases:AMILOIDE, The Movie ‚Äî Inception Style Trailer, youtube.com the AMILOIDE project aims to search digital libraries of millions of compounds for potential drugs to interfere with the formation of aggregates and amyloid fibers, which can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, the main target diseases being studied are familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and Alzheimer's disease. This project is the responsibility of scientists of the Structural and Computational Biology Group at the Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology (CNC) of the University of Coimbra. *Neurosim: an immersion in the molecular structure of memory: scientists at the Institute of Matter Structure, CSIC use the results of the Neurosim application to analyze the structural properties of amino acids and small peptides (sequences of a few tens of amino acids) that act in the human brain and nervous system. By simulating the so-called energy landscape for each amino acid, key steps can be made in reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of proteins from the amino acid sequence, advancing the study of the structure and function of the human brain. *Adsorption: behaviour of confined fluids in limited spaces: the Adsorption application helps researchers from the Instituto de Qu√≠mica-F√≠sica Rocasolano from CSIC study the adsorption properties of the pillared clays that are widely used as industrial catalysers, materials for gas storage, and industrial separation agents. This kind of clay is used in industrial processes such as the production of biofuels from vegetable oils, the storage of natural gas at room temperature and the storage of greenhouse gases produced by industry. *Cuanticables: quantic wires simulations: scientists of the University of Buenos Aires use this application to study the degree to which the faults in the material of quantum wires has on their electric current. For this purpose, they develop a theoretical model which simulates the quantum wire, the impurities and the electrodes to which the quantum wire connects, and study the behaviour of the current that is generated across the wire when an external voltage is applied to it. *Sanidad: improved diagnostics: ionizing radiation is used in health applications ranging from basic diagnostic tests in a modern hospital (in radiology, nuclear medicine and laboratory tests) to the treatment of cancer by radiotherapy. For these purposes, both actual radioactive materials (in the form of seeds or injectable material) and complex equipment that generates photon beams and electrons can be utilised. Physicists from Andaluc√≠a use the Sanidad simulations to improve knowledge of the safe use of radiation in healthcare, and to explore potential new applications. *Criticalidad: electron transport in disordered systems with fractal properties: the Criticalidad project helps Mexican investigators understand the properties and effects of fractality in the transport of electrons through disordered systems in the Anderson transition.Ibercivis.pt - Criticalidad. Retrieved 2011-10-15. *Soluvel: researching solubility of toxic and pharmaceutical compounds: the aim of the Soluvel project is to calculate the solvation energies of certain soluble compounds, so as to identify through computation which compounds may prove toxic to humans, and which may serve as effective medical drugs. The project is being conducted by researchers from the Laboratory of Molecular Simulation of Separation and Reaction Engineering (LSRE), a division of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto.Ibercivis.pt - Soluvel.

Ninety six of them were procured for service on the stub lines running from Munich into the mountains, but in reality they were stationed in many large Bavarian locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerke or Bw). Two engines were transferred to the Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) in 1916, the remaining 94 later joined the Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet and were incorporated as DRG Class 73.0-1 with operating numbers 73 031‚Äì124. The Palatinate Railway procured the almost identical Palatine P 2.II class in 31 examples during the years 1900 to 1903. 28 engines were taken over as 73 001‚Äì028 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the remaining three were handed over to the Saar Railway (Saarbahn). Between 1903 and 1912, 37 engines went to the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine (Reichseisenbahnen in Elsa√ü-Lothringen) and were given the numbers T 5 6601‚Äì6637. One of these vehicles was taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn under operating number 73 125. The Bavarian Pt 2/5 H built in 1906 as a one-off, had shown that the use of a superheater brought no clear gains due to the low coupled axle load. As a result, in 1907 nine similar machines with saturated steam operation were built, as the Bavarian Pt 2/5 N class. These engines were incorporated into the Deutsche Reichsbahn as numbers 73 131 to 73 139. Most of the locomotives were retired by 1925; but several examples were still in the vehicle park until 1948.

Beginnings There had been occasional discussion about the viability of having a locally based radio station in the area, but nothing had ever eventuated. A Melbourne radio station executive, M. B. Duffy, became aware, through his involvement with 3KZ, that radio reception in the Colac-Otway area was generally very poor. Duffy took the initiative and went to Colac in an effort to interest local businessmen in his proposal to establish a radio station in the area. He was fortunate in finding some enthusiastic backers from within the town and, in 1938, they joined forces to form the Colac Broadcasting Company Pty Ltd.Peel, Geoff. 50 Golden Years, A history of 3CS. Associated Communication Enterprises, 1989, p.1, The most vital requirement in the preparatory stage was the granting of the all-important licence to broadcast, which was obtained on 27 January 1939. The need for a studio was quickly filled by director Malcolm Wallace, who undertook to provide a suitable site. The property at 241 Murray Street (where the station still stands) was selected, and construction work was soon under way.Peel, Geoff. 50 Golden Years, A history of 3CS. Associated Communication Enterprises, 1989, p.3, Opening night There was an air of excitement and \\"considerable interest\\" around the town in the lead-up to the Saturday night opening of 3CS on 7 October 1939. A large representation of local dignitaries arrived at the new station building for the 8pm opening of 3CS. Attendance was by invitation and the guest list read like a \\"Who's Who\\" of the Colac district. Local MLC Mr J. P. Jones; the Colac Shire President, Cr J. Miller; councillors L. Bayer, G. Howey and A. Bilson and the Town Clerk Mr A. N. Walls were all included in the official party. Appropriately, the Mayor of Colac at this time was Cr. Walter Selwood, the chairman of directors of the Colac Broadcasting Company.Peel, Geoff. 50 Golden Years, A history of 3CS. Associated Communication Enterprises, 1989, p.7, Cr Selwood invited the local Federal Member, the Hon. G. A. Street, Minister for Defence to open the station. Receiving an enthusiastic reception from the crowd, Street thanked the directors for their invitation to perform the happy duty. Referring to the recently-declared outbreak of World War II, he said it helped him forget, at least for a short time, some of the worries that now confronted him. Referring to 3CS, Street remarked on the efforts of those who had been behind establishing the station: \\"That showed there was a fine spirit of enterprise in the community, which was prepared to stand behind something new in the district\\", and he thought the broadcasting station would be a tremendous benefit. In officially declaring the station open, he \\"wished it every success and that the standard maintained, would be one of which the district would be proud.\\". With radio station 3CS officially on the air, the Revellers orchestra struck up, and an evening of varied entertainment launched the station for guests and listeners alike. Early Broadcasts Colac and district listeners seem to have quickly responded to this new medium, despite what would seem to listeners today as irregular hours of operation. Transmission commenced at 6.30am and continued until the station closed down at 9.30am each day. A further session would be held between noon and 4.00pm, with another break off air until 5.30pm. The station closed down at 10.30pm on weeknights, but continued until midnight on Saturdays. Provision was made to extend the times if necessary, to cover special functions. On Sundays, 3CS did not commence broadcasting until 11.00am. The first session lasted to 2.00pm, with the evening program running from 5.30pm to 10.30pm.Peel, Geoff. 50 Golden Years, A history of 3CS. Associated Communication Enterprises, 1989, pp. 94‚Äì96.

It is located in Quinta Normal Park. History The museum is one of the oldest natural history museums in South America. It was founded on September 14, 1830 by the French naturalist Claudio Gay, commissioned by the Chilean government. Its original mandate was the biology and geography of Chile, with a concentration on crops and mineral resources. The current building was constructed in 1875 as a palace, or pavilion, for the Chilean International Exhibition. In 1889 departments of botany, zoology, and mineralogy were established. The National Museum Bulletin (Bolet√≠n del Museo Nacional) was first published in 1908, and continues today under the title Bulletin of the National Museum of Natural History (Bolet√≠n del Museo Nacional de Historia Natural). Earthquakes in August 1906 and April 1927 have damaged the museum.A flyer handed out at the museum. Humberto Fuenzalida was director of the museum until Grete Mostny became director in 1964. She led the museum until 1982.Grete Mostny, Memorial for the victims of National Socialism, University of Vienna, Retrieved 9 November 2015 Exhibits and collections The central hall, with a sei whale skeleton The museum currently has twelve permanent exhibits: *Biogeography of Chile, a long tunnel that fills much of the first floor *Interactive children's games for terrestrial ecosystems *The Central Hall exhibits, including a 17-meter skeleton of a blue whale *Minerals, with an emphasis on the nitrate boom of the early twentieth century. *Insects, including large fossil dragonflies *Mollusks *Mesozoic era vertebrates, including a specimen of Carnotaurus sastrei *Chilean timber *Chilean archaeology *Juan Fern√°ndez Islands *Cultural anthropology, covering the Aymara, Mapuche, Selk'nam, Rapanui, Kaweskar, and Y√°mana. The museum houses the finest public collection of rongorongo artifacts in the world. *The uses of copper, a collection of Codelco, the state mining corporation The oldest mummies in the world are found in the museum, being around 7400 years old (2000 years older than their Egyptian counterparts). Fifteen of them were put into a CAT scan in late 2016. Scientists hope to learn more about the mummification process used by the Chinchorro people of Chile. The 15 mummies were women and children and scientists note that different preservation techniques were used. A collection of molluscs from Chile and other parts of the world is present in the museum. The collection has been assembled since the beginning of the study of the natural history of Chile. Juan I. Molina collected 11 species of molluscs in 1782. French zoologists published studies of the molluscs in Chile in the 1800s. In 1853, Rodulfo A. Philippi (a German doctor) was hired as a naturalist by the Chilean government and was appointed director and curator of the Museum. As of 2003, the mollusc collection was being organized and catalogued, taking into account various donations and exchanges made by Philippi until the end of his term in 1897. Philippi's son Federico Philippi served as director of the museum from 1897 to 1910. Medical doctor Eduardo Moore was director from 1910 to 1927. Civil engineer Ricardo Latcham served as director from 1928 to 1943. Naturalist Enrique Gigoux was director from 1943 to 1948. Geologist Humberto Fuenzalida was director from 1949 to 1963; his tenure was marked by a grand expansion at the museum, with the formation of the malacology laboratory under tutelage of professor Nibaldo Bahamonde. Marine fossils from the late Miocene and the early Pliocene were quarried from marine sandstone deposits on the north-central coast of Chile in the early 1990s and added to the museum's collection shortly thereafter. Departments and oversight The five departments are botany, zoology, entomology, anthropology, and paleontology. The department of botany includes a herbarium of 3700 species dating from 1830. 90% of the type specimens of Chilean species are housed here. The zoology department contains fourteen holotypes, mainly Chilean marine and freshwater fish. The anthropological department emphasizes the archeology of Central Chile through the Inca Empire and cultural artifacts of modern or recently extinct peoples of Chile and Easter Island. One of its duties is the caretaking of the Plomo Mummy. The Museum is overseen by the Director of the National Cultural Heritage Service, itself a division of the Chilean Ministry of Cultures, Arts and Heritage.

The song is a nostalgic first-person recollection of what is presented as a typical 1960s French adolescence. While the story is sung in French, several English-language hits of the 1960s are used to illustrate the memories. An English and Spanish version were made by Voulzy, adapting the lyrics.

The Sensation Lawn Mower Company was located in Ralston, Nebraska, USA.  History  Howard Phelps received patent number 2,265,545 on his mowing machine, which featured a rotary cutting blade directly driven by an industrial quality electric motor in 1941. This very prototype still exists and is on display at the Pioneer Village Museum in Minden, NE. The Sensation Lawn Mower Company was started by Howard and his wife Rosemary Rodman Phelps. Phelps designed a gasoline powered mower in 1944. Later during the 1950s a generation of snow blowers were developed under the name of Snow Blow. Phelps held patents on over 20 innovations in the lawn industry including the first for a rotary mower grass catcher U.S. patent number 2,855,744 in 1960. In 1966 Phelps sold the company to local real estate agent Frank Rogers who in turn sold it to a group of Chicago investors headed by Carl Johnson the plant was moved to 16th and Evans Streets in North Omaha, Nebraska.

Gilson Brothers' products were distinctive due to a bright orange and white color scheme. In 1988 Gilson was bought out by Lawnboy, which was acquired in 1989 by Toro. Sensation brand lawn mowers are no longer produced but are still in use today. Mowers were available with the Sensation brand into the 1980s. The Sensation brand was preferred by many landscapers because to their perceived high-quality and apparent longevity. The mower was considered unique because of features such as greaseable wheels, thick cast aluminum decks, and some unique innovations like a cone-shaped metal crankshaft support which was purported to help prevent bending of the crankshaft. = Brand timeline = * 1942 - Sensation Mower Inc. founded by Howard Phelps. * 1966 - Phelps sells the company to local real estate agent Frank Rogers. * 1967 - Rogers sells the company to a group of Chicago investors headed by Carl Johnson. * 1982 - Sensation Lawn Mower Company was bought by Gilson Brothers. * 1980s - Sensation Lawn Mowers cease to be sold.

First, Pluto tries to eat the cake, but is caught by his master, Mickey Mouse, when it is time for his bath. As soon as Pluto is looking more neat and tidy, he tries to eat the cake but then gets spotted by his master again. Then, Mickey's nephews barge the gate down and trample all over Pluto as they hurry to the party. The children give Pluto a small red wagon and treat him like a workhorse. They then all start to enjoy themselves at the party. They first take Pluto on the slide, then barge down the swing. Then, they play pin the tail on Pluto to see who can pin Pluto's tail. Soon it is time for lunch and Pluto wants to have a piece of his own cake, but Mickey's nephews prefer to amuse themselves by grabbing every slice of cake and eating it up, much to Pluto's horror. Eventually, they devour Pluto's birthday cake and leave. Pluto, understandably upset at the torture Mickey's nephews have given him and Mickey's unusual meanness, angrily throws a tantrum, knocking away all the dishes until Mickey passes him the last slice of the birthday cake he saved.

Political background  After the end of World War I, Poland re-obtained access to the Baltic Sea by the Polish Corridor; the territory had been an integral part of Poland prior to 1772, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the first partition of Poland. The corridor separated the Weimar Republic from the newly created territory of East Prussia. Because of this separation, the German Ministry for Transport established the Seedienst Ostpreu√üen to provide a ferry connection to the German exclave.  Ships and routes  A ship of the \\"Seedienst Ostpreussen\\" On 30 January 1920 the first HAPAG ship \\"H√∂rnum\\" travelled from Swinem√ºnde to Pillau on behalf of the German Government. Other ships were provided by North German Lloyd and the Shipping Company Braeunlich. At first these ships left Swinem√ºnde four times a week, later once a day in Summer and 4-5 times a week in Winter, also harbouring in Zoppot and Stolpm√ºnde. The route subsequently expanded to Memel (Klaipƒóda) (1927) and LiepƒÅja (1930) in Lithuania and Latvia respectively, and L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde (1933) and Kiel (1934) in Schleswig-Holstein. Due to the increasing distances the original ships were no longer able to meet the requirements of the route and in 1926 the \\"Preussen\\" (of Shipping Company Braeunlich) and the \\"Hansestadt Danzig\\" (of North German Lloyd) went into service, followed by \\"Tannenberg\\" (of HAPAG) in 1935. The projected \\"Marienburg\\" wasn't finished after the beginning of World War II, but completed in 1950 in Wismar as a reparation for the Soviet Union, later running as ‚Äû–õ–µ–Ω—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç\\" (Lensoviet) and ‚Äû–ê–±—Ö–∞–∑–∏—è\\" (Abchasia) on the Black Sea and ultimately scrapped in 1980 at Barcelona.

Common adjustments include inclining the upper body and raising the lower body independently of each other. Other common features include height adjustment and tilting the bed to raise the upper body or the lower body into the Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg positions. The market for motorized adjustable bed bases is expanding, as the mattress industry has begun to heavily promote them to consumers as a comfort and lifestyle choice.Best, Mary. \\"Dream machines: Adjustable bases charting big sales gains.\\" BedTimes Magazine. November 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-20.  Types and descriptions  Adjustable beds have been used in hospitals for a long time, but have become more commonly used in homecare over the past three decades, as they have been found to provide relief from various conditions. They can help provide a more comfortable sleep for those recovering from surgery, aiding circulation, breathing and swelling. Adjustable beds used in hospitals and homecare are similar in basic functionality. The four main options available in the homecare industry are: Standard ‚Äì Standard profiling beds can be lowered to around 40cm and raised to around 80cm and have a maximum user weight capacity of at least 28 stone (180kg). Low ‚Äì Similar to the standard profiling bed, however the low bed has a minimum platform height of 21cm. Ultra-Low ‚Äì Designed for use without side rails this bed can be lowered to just 67mm from the floor so that if the user falls from the bed, the impact is minimized, especially when used in conjunction with a crash mat. Bariatric ‚Äì These weight baring beds should have a weight capacity of no less than 45 stone (286kg) and be no less than 120cm wide. Hospital beds must be able to withstand more rigorous and regular cleaning in order to reduce contamination. Therefore, any electrical bed components used in the hospital environment need to meet minimum waterproofing standards in order to withstand the cleaning process. Homecare beds are less likely to be subjected to such intense cleaning, even if used within a care home, and this allows manufacturers to design beds whose aesthetics match home furnishings by using divan style beds or by using wooden veneer and laminates. The basic and most popular structure is of a slatted base with a twin drive or a triple drive motor. The support of the mattress comes from the flexibility of the slats and their elastic mountings on the frame. The slatted bases are economic price-wise and can be lifted with lightweight actuators. The more advanced structure is the fully flexible base; it provides support to the mattress in every pressure point. They also require more powerful motors due to their weight. Fully flexible bases are usually made of zoned fillings of HR or of cold foam, sometimes covered with either latex or 3D mesh (spacer fabric) layer. The fully flexible bases are more solid and many would say more comfortable in providing a better support to the mattress. Both slatted or fully flexible bases can consist of four joints (back/stable/leg/foot) or 5 joints (neck/back/stable/leg/foot), usually operated by twin drive motors that operate the back and leg joint, and the movement of the neck and foot joint is semi automatic (sometimes there are motors with three actuators - also for the neck, and even with four - one for every joint). Another structural difference is the sliding back mechanism (sometimes called wall hugger or wall climber) which allows to minimise the gap with the back wall when the bed is uplifted, keeps the bedside table within reach, and enables the partners using the bed (if split) to keep eye contact at all times. In the 90's the sliding back mechanism was found only in the elite luxury products but it is becoming more common with the popular models, even with those that use slatted bases. The increasing popularity of motorised adjustable beds for homecare is also partly due to the benefits provided to the caretaker, by allowing him or her to work at a comfortable height and reduce the risk of back injuries. Height adjustment and raising the upper body also assists users in getting out of bed with little or no assistance dependent on their condition. In Europe, all adjustable beds for use within healthcare must be CE marked and also be compliant with EN1970.

It is now an annex of the Hakone Fujiya Hotel. The Hayama Imperial Villa was acquired by the Imperial Household Agency in 1894. It is located on the east bank of Sagami Bay in central Miura Peninsula, just south of Kamakura. The villa was a favorite of Emperor Taish≈ç and he often visited to convalesce from his illnesses and to escape from the stresses of his official duties in Tokyo. Emperor Taish≈ç died at the Hayama Imperial Villa in December 1926. The villa was subsequently used by Emperor Sh≈çwa, who also built a marine biology laboratory on its grounds. Research from the laboratory has resulted in a number of technical monographs. The Imperial Family traditionally uses the Hayama residence in February‚ÄìMarch, the season when few tourists visit the area. The villa was burned down in 1971 in an act of arson and was rebuilt as a one-story building of western architectural design. A portion of the grounds was donated to the town of Hayama at that time, and is now the Hayama Shiosai Park, with a traditional Japanese garden and teahouse, and a small museum displaying part of Emperor Hirohito‚Äôs collection of marine specimens from Sagami Bay.

Wet Spiral Separators Spiral separators of the wet type, also called spiral concentrators, are devices to separate solid components in a slurry, based upon a combination of the solid particle density as well as the particle's hydrodynamic properties (e.g. drag). The device consists of a tower, around which is wound a sluice, from which slots or channels are placed in the base of the sluice to extract solid particles that have come out of suspension. As larger and heavier particles sink to the bottom of the sluice faster and experience more drag from the bottom, they travel slower, and so move towards the center of the spiral. Conversely, light particles stay towards the outside of the spiral, with the water, and quickly reach the bottom. At the bottom, a \\"cut\\" is made with a set of adjustable bars, channels, or slots, separating the low and high density parts. Many things can be done to improve the separation efficiency, including: * changing the rate of material feed *changing the grain size of the material *changing the slurry mass percentage *adjusting the cutter bar positions *running the output of one spiral separator (often, a third, intermediate, cut) through a second. *adding washwater inlets along the length of the spiral, to aid in separating light minerals *adding multiple outlets along the length, to improve the ability of the spiral to remove heavy contaminants *adding ridges on the sluice at an angle to the direction of flow. Typical spiral concentrators will use a slurry from about 20%-40% solids by weight, with a particle size somewhere between 1.5-.075 mm (17-340 mesh), though somewhat larger particle sizes are sometimes used. For good separation, the density difference between the heavy minerals and the light minerals in the feedstock should be at least 1 g/cm3; and because the separation is dependent upon size and density, spiral separators are most effective at purifying ore if its particles are of uniform size and shape. A spiral separator may process a couple tons per hour of ore, per flight, and multiple flights may be stacked in the same space as one, to improve capacity. Dry Spiral Separators Dry spiral separators, capable of distinguishing round particles from nonrounds, are used to sort the feed by shape. The device consists of a tower, around which is wound an inwardly inclined flight. A catchment funnel is placed around this inner flight. Round particles roll at a higher speed than other objects, and so are flung off the inner flight and into the collection funnel. Shapes which are not round enough are collected at the bottom of the flight. Separators of this type may be used for removing weed seeds from the intended harvest, or to remove deformed lead shot.

The original Mino captured video in 640x480 resolution at 30 frames per second with later models featuring HD recording. The Mino had many features that the Flip Video did not have, including an internal rechargeable battery (instead of 2 AA batteries) and touch-sensitive pause, fast forward, and rewind buttons. The Mino was almost 2 ounces lighter than the Flip and the arm with the USB plug changed positions. History The Flip Video Mino was released on June 4, 2008 by Pure Digital. On November 12, 2008, the Flip MinoHD was released. It had the same dimensions as the regular Mino, but with HD, 30 frames per second recording capabilities. Its internal storage was upgraded to 4 GB while maintaining about one hour of recording time due to the increased optical resolution. The battery life gave about 2 hours of recording time when fully charged. The original 4 GB MinoHD only had a 3.5mm headphone jack (4-way TRRS : Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve or A/V : audio-video) to composite (RCA) output for connecting to a television or input into other media viewing monitors. This was a major drawback to quick viewing of videos on a high definition television, considering that the output video was captured in 720p high definition and composite cables are unable to transmit HD resolution to HD capable televisions. This flaw was corrected in the later released 8 GB version that utilized a mini HDMI output port, which gave the option for Mini HDMI to composite (RCA) or component cables, as well as Mini HDMI to HDMI. This allowed videos to be viewed in full HD on an HD capable television. In moving to a higher HD resolution, the Flip MinoHD changed from the MPEG-4 Part 2 (.avi) file format to the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Part 10 (.mp4) format. Reception The Flip Mino received great praise from the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek. The Wall Street Journal concluded that: \\"If you're in the market for a simple camcorder that records high-quality video, the Flip MinoHD is definitely worth $50 more than the regular Flip Mino. But don't say I didn't warn you so when you're bummed out by the screen's still-small size and its inability to share true HD footage via the FlipShare software.\\" IT Reviews commented that the MinoHD was a \\"healthy evolution of a popular product, but like its predecessors it can suffer from being a bit too simplistic and omitting some key features that may still be helpful for beginners.\\" The review concluded: \\"As pocket camcorders go though, it's an impressive device.\\"http://www.itreviews.co.uk/hardware/h2271.htm IT Reviews MinoHD review The Flip Video MinoHD was the number one in \\"best budget camcorder\\" in Cnet's Editors' top camcorder choices.

It is located on the west bank of Sagami Bay at the southern tip of Izu Peninsula near where the waters of the bay mix with the Kuroshio Current offshore. The Villa was the location of a marine biology laboratory managed by Emperor Sh≈çwa, who used to visit it for some ten days in spring, summer and winter, and complemented the similar laboratory he operated at the Hayama Imperial Villa on the opposite side of the bay. Research from the laboratory has resulted in a number of technical monographs. The villa building itself is a one-story building of western architectural design and dates to 1971. The adjacent private beach is informally known as Tenno Beach, or Emperor Beach. The bay is not deep, providing safety for the Emperor's family. The beach is surrounded by beautiful rock formations, which further limits public access. References * Corner, E. J. H. His Majesty Emperor Hirohito of Japan, K.

Prut was awarded the title of Honoured Artist of the RSFSR (1983). Biography Iosif Prut was born on November 18, 1900 in the city of Taganrog, in the Don Host Oblast of the Russian Empire. In 1901 his immediate family were diagnosed with acute tuberculosis and they travelled to Leysin, Switzerland, for a treatment in a local clinic. His father soon died of complications and was buried in Gerbersdorf, Germany. Iosif stayed in Leysin for treatment until 1908. After returning several times to Taganrog and studying for a while at a Rostov on Don gymnasium, he moved to Switzerland for permanent residence with his aunt Anne Helghi and entered the √âcole Nouvelle, a private school in Chailly near Lausanne. Among his alumni and close friends were Edward \\"Donnie\\" Donegall (1915-1918), a well-known war journalist, Constantine \\"Costa\\" Gratsos, vice president of Onassis' Victory Carriers, and Fr√©d√©ric Siordet, lawyer, author and vice president of the International Red Cross. In 1918 he graduated from the √âcole Nouvelle and enlisted to the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris, but quit and volunteered to serve in the Russian expeditionary corps. Iosif Prut was decorated with a Transfiguration cross. After returning to Russia, he participated in the Russian Civil War within the 1st Cavalry Army (Soviet Union) under command of Semyon Budyonny, was in command of a platoon within the 36th regiment of the 6th Cavalry Caucasus division. Iosif Prut moved to Moscow in 1922. For the first time Prut wrote for a Red Army gazette in 1919. Most playwrights were dedicated to the Soviet Army and were staged at the Red Army Theater. Prut worked for the Mezhrabpom-Rus(–ú–µ–∂—Ä–∞–±–ø–æ–º-–†—É—Å—å) film studio in 1924-1928, and for Lenfilm in 1928-1932.

Wiser (October 4, 1825 ‚Äì April 30, 1911) was an American-born Canadian distiller, manufacturer, rancher and political figure. His whisky distillery was the third largest in Canada, and he served a term as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Grenville South, from 1878 to 1882. Early life Wiser was born in Oneida County, New York, the son of Isaac J. Wiser and Mary Egert. In 1856, he married Emily, the daughter of Harlow Godard. Distillery Wiser moved to Prescott, Ontario in 1857 to work for his maternal uncle, Charles Egert, who owned the local Charles Payne Distillery and Farm with business partner Amos Averell. Wiser started as manager of the distillery. Five years later he bought out Egert and Averell to become sole owner of the distillery and farm. At the time, the distiller was producing 116,500 gallons of whisky a year. By the time of the American Civil War, Wiser's Red Letter Rye was sold in Canada and Wiser's Canada Whisky was for export. Wiser introduced whisky in bottles at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Prior to this time, whisky was only sold in casks or barrels. Wiser's son, Harlow, operated the distillery to an output of 500,000 gallons a year, but he died in 1895 at the age of 36 from a heart attack. By the early 1900s, Wiser was exporting whisky around the world and his distillery in Prescott became the third largest in Canada behind Hiram Walker's in Windsor and Gooderham & Worts' in Toronto. By 1935, all three of these competitors operated under the same majority owner. Wiser's large farm raised cattle and racing horses. After Wiser's death, the distillery in Prescott was merged with Corby Distilleries. His name continues today on several brands of J.P. Wiser Whisky, including his original Red Letter Rye.

Life and career Walter Pfeiffer was born in Zurich, in 1946 and has been producing since the early 1970s. His portraits of friends, lovers and the youth surrounding him in cities such as Zurich, Paris and New York would link him to other photographers of that decade, such as Nan Goldin and Nobuyoshi Araki. His first book of photographs appeared in 1980, Walter Pfeiffer: 1970-1980 (Elke Betzel, 1980). The next two decades were spent in relative obscurity, while the photographer kept on producing his photography and a few videos, while at the same time returning to painting. The breakthrough and rediscovery of his work would have to wait until the beginning of the century, when Welcome Aboard, Photographs 1980-2000 (Edition Patrick Frey/Scab, 2001) was published. His work was then linked to the revival of realistic photography in the 1990s and early 2000s, with artists such as Wolfgang Tillmans, Ryan McGinley, Slava Mogutin, Heinz Peter Knes and Jack Pierson. His influence on the work of photographers like Juergen Teller has been noted. Since then, Walter Pfeiffer has collaborated with international magazines as diverse in style and audience as i-D, Butt and Vogue. Artist Rep agency Art + Commerce represents Walter Pfeiffer for image licensing and advertising. Publications His first book of photographs, Walter Pfeiffer: 1970-1980, was published in 1980, followed a few years later by The eyes, the thoughts, ceaselessly wandering (Nachbar der Welt, 1986), but raised little attention. His work would only garner an international audience after the publication of Welcome Aboard, Photographs 1980-2000, in 2001. Since then, three new books have followed, released by international publishing houses such as Hatje Cantz and Steidl, including Night and Day (Hatje Cantz, 2007), Walter Pfeiffer: In Love with Beauty (Steidl, 2009) and Cherchez la femme!, also in 2009. Exhibitions Exhibitions of Walter Pfeiffer's photography have multiplied considerably in the past decade, due in part to his collaborations with magazines such as i-D and Vogue, but also the publications of his books by Hatje Cantz and other international publishers. In the past few years, his most important shows were in New York City and Paris, in galleries such as Galerie Baumet Sultana (Paris), Team Gallery and Anna Kustera (New York). Models Walter Pfeiffer has stated in interviews that he prefers to work with non-professionals. His casting is usually done by himself, friends and a few assistants, often approaching subjects in the street. However, in the past few years, due to his work in the fashion industry, Pfeiffer has also photographed professional models such as Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Magdalena Frackowiak, Eva Herzigov√°, Francisco Lachowski and Lorcan Leather- Barrow.

He was admitted to Middle Temple on 8 November 1912, but withdrew in 1916 without being Called to the Bar. He joined the Royal Flying Corps during World War I and became an experienced pilot, but was badly injured after a forced landing. On behalf of the Air Ministry and War Office he returned to Cambridge to undertake research into acoustics, with special reference to psychological problems. At this time he devised some innovative methods for the mathematical assessment of feelings, which proved useful in his later work. He investigated the mediums Kathleen Goligher and Gladys Osborne Leonard and he set about studying psychical research in more detail. Between 1934 and 1936 Carington tested the trance mediumship of Eileen Garrett, Gladys Osborne Leonard and Rudi Schneider with psychogalvanic reflex and word association tests.Mauskopf, Seymour; McVaugh, Michael.

Vol. 28, No. 753. pp. 165‚Äì166. \\"Mr. Carington subjected a considerable number of mediums, both in their normal condition and in the trance state, to what psychologists call the word- association test. This consists in the examiner saying one word, and the subject answering with the first word that comes into his mind. The answer gives a picture of the mental state of the subject... In their normal state, they gave one set of reactions to test words. In their trance, their \\"controls\\" gave the opposite set of reactions. This led Mr. Carington to suspect that a medium's \\"control\\" is no messenger from the spirit world, but simply an ordinarily suppressed \\"other self\\" who gets leave to speak up during the trance condition.\\"Edmunds, Simeon. (1965) Miracles of the Mind: An Introduction to Parapsychology. Thomas. p. 77. \\"Drayton Thomas made the notes of his sittings with Mrs. Leonard available to W. Whately Carington when the latter carried out his noted quantitative study of mediumship, and collaborated closely with him in this work, although he disagreed strongly with Carington's conclusion that \\"Feda\\" was not a spirit entity, but merely a secondary personality of the medium. Carington's view, however, received formidable support from the results of his application of the psychological technique known as the word association test, which he made on Mrs. Leonard and a number of other trance mediums.\\"Douglas, Alfred. (1982). Extra-Sensory Powers: A Century of Psychical Research. Overlook Press. p. 159. \\"Carington was interested in the psychology of the trance state, and to investigate this further applied Word Association Tests to various mediums, including Mrs Leonard. The results were not conclusive, but in the case of Mrs Leonard Carington believed that they demonstrated a \\"counter-similarity\\" between the personalities of Mrs Leonard and Feda; an inverse relationship that tended to confirm Lady Troubridge's studies. Carington concluded that in his view Feda was a secondary personality of Mrs Leonard, probably formed round a nucleus of repressed material.\\"Franklyn, Julian. (2003). Dictionary of the Occult. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 230. \\"It was further shown by Mr. Whately Carington, using the psycho-galvanic-reflex, that the medium's spirit control \\"Olga\\", who claims to be the ghost of a Spanish dancing-girl, Lola Montez, is in reality indistinguishable in psychological make-up from Rudi himself.\\" Criticism of Carington's tests on mediums came from C. D. Broad and R. H. Thouless who wrote he had made statistical errors and misinterpreted numerical data.Broad, C. D. (2011). Lectures on Psychical Research. Routledge Reprint Edition. p. 200. The psychologist Donald West had praised the tests that Carington performed with Leonard.West, Donald. (1954). Psychical Research Today. Duckworth. p. 60. \\"Carington discovered that the results given by Feda and Mrs Leonard were neither what one would expect from testing two different persons nor what one would normally get from testing the same person twice. Superficially their patterns were grossly dissimilar, but they were related to each other ‚Äì that is, negatively correlated. Where the normal Mrs Leonard tended to give a long reaction time, the entranced Mrs Leonard gave a short one, and vice versa. In other words Feda and Mrs Leonard were not independent individuals; they were complementary characters. The result is in keeping with the theory that Feda is a dramatization of the medium's own subconscious trends. It is very difficult to reconcile these findings with a Spiritualistic interpretation.\\" Carington gave up all other work for his interest in psychical research. He lived on a small private income for a time in a remote village in the Netherlands. In 1938 he travelled to Germany, to rescue a woman from harassment by the Gestapo. They later married and set up home in Cornwall, where his wife collaborated in his experiments and nursed him as his health gradually failed. His early death at the age of fifty-four was due in part to his injury during World War I, and to overwork. The psychical researcher Ren√©e Haynes described Carington as a \\"shy, dedicated retiring man, whose services to psychical research have never been fully recognized.\\"Haynes, Ren√©e. (1982). The Society for Psychical Research, 1882‚Äì1982: A History. Macdonald. p. 92. Hypotheses Carington theorised that individual minds are less isolated from one another than is assumed. Carington's hypothesis of telepathy was to draw upon the association of ideas: in a mind, one idea yields to another through associative links. Carington hypothesized that telepathy depends upon an analogous type of linkage at a subconscious level. He suggested that such links could perhaps be reinforced by what he called 'K‚Äô ideas or objects. Carington speculated on the concept of a \\"group mind\\" and \\"psychons\\". He believed that minds which hold a great deal of their images in common may be favourable for telepathic communication.Telepathy and the Group Mind. (1945). The British Medical Journal. Vol. 2, No. 4433. p. 886Samuel, Lawrence. (2011). Supernatural America: A Cultural History: A Cultural History. Praeger. p. 61. \\"British author Whately Carington (no relation to the American writer Hereward Carrington) posited that ‚Äúmind-stuff‚Äù (composed of ‚Äúpsychons,‚Äù or ideas) was analogous to but completely distinct from matter in the physical world. Although their cognitive equivalent had yet to be discovered, dimensions of the physical world‚Äîtime and space‚Äîdid not apply to the mind, Carington argued, meaning people's mental processes could overlap. While our conscious minds were isolated units, our subconscious minds were not, he theorized, making an \\"association of ideas\\" possible between people who were acquainted with each other and, better yet, had common interests.\\"\\"Walter Whately Carington\\". Biographical Dictionary of Parapsychology. \\"Carington's best known and most controversial contribution to parapsychology is his \\"association theory\\" of telepathy, the basis of which is the concept that minds are systems of ideas and sensa (termed \\"psychons\\" by Carington). Such \\"psychon systems,\\" he held, are not wholly insulated from one another, and in telepathy interaction between psychons in different minds takes place according to the same laws of association as govern the interaction of psychons in a single mind.\\" Carington wrote about his hypothesis in his book Telepathy (1945). The book received a positive review in the British Medical Journal which described it as an \\"extremely interesting and, though often highly speculative, a thought-provoking book.\\" However Frank Finger gave the book a negative review in The Quarterly Review of Biology claiming Carington failed to present any scientific data that could be intelligently evaluated and concluded \\"it seems doubtful that this book will alter the scientific status of telepathic communication appreciably, and certainly it will cause no great upheaval in the field of biological science.\\"Finger, Frank. (1947). Thought Transference: An Outline of Facts, Theory and Implications of Telepathy by Whately Carington. The Quarterly Review of Biology. Vol. 22, No. 1. pp. 97‚Äì98. Carington's ideas about telepathy inspired the novelist Iris Murdoch who wrote \\"His theory, though wrong I've no doubt, is interesting.\\"\\"Iris Murdoch's early works and her struggle to 'write something good' revealed\\". The Telegraph. The philosopher Antony Flew wrote the verdict seemed to go against Carington's hypothesis because it \\"commits him to saying that the various sub-laws of association (those of Recency, Repetition, etc.) will apply to telepathic association also.\\"Flew, Antony. (1953). A New Approach To Psychical Research. Watts & Co. p. 132 Carington in his book Matter, Mind, and Meaning (1949) advocated a form of neutral monism.

The Mason Machine Works was a machinery manufacturing company located in Taunton, Massachusetts, between 1845 and 1944. The company became famous for an early invention by its creator, William Mason, the self-acting mule, first patented in 1840. The company also later produced locomotives, rifles during the American Civil War, and later printing presses. However, the production of textile machinery would remain the company's core business during the late 19th century, until its decline in the 1920s. Origins The son of a blacksmith born in 1808 at Mystic, Connecticut, William Mason became a skilled master mechanic while still in his teens, working for various companies in the Killingly, Connecticut, area that were involved with machinery for the growing textile industry. In 1835, Mason moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, to work for Crocker and Richmond, a company that made ring spinning frames for the cotton textile industry. While the firm failed in the financial crisis of 1837, it was soon taken over by Leach and Keith. Mason was made foreman. Textile Machinery By the time William Mason began his career, there had been a growing industry of machine building in the United States. It was a specialized art requiring tools, materials, skills and designs that had been gradually increasing through the early part of the 19th century. The ideas of early pioneers in the textile machine industry such as David Wilkinson at Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and Paul Moody at Waltham, Massachusetts, were constantly being tinkered with and improved upon during this time. On October 8, 1840, Mason's greatest invention, the \\"self-acting mule\\" was patented. Competition required improvements and on October 3, 1846, he received a patent for \\"Mason's Self-acting Mule.\\" The self-acting mule was a triumph of automation. This device would become the industry standard for years to come. With the failure of Leach and Keith in 1842, William Mason convinced investors to help him establish his own company, the Mason Machine Works. In 1845, new buildings were erected and the plant became the largest one devoted to the manufacture of machinery in the country. It made cotton machinery, woolen machinery, machinists' tools, blowers, cupola furnaces, gearing, shafting, and railroad car wheels made with spokes. The Mason Machine Works would become most important company in Taunton, Massachusetts, for much of the 19th century. Locomotives After 1852, the company expanded again, venturing into the locomotive business. Mason's innovative locomotive designs quickly drew praise from railroad engineers and operators, and were known to be the easiest engines to repair. His ideas and improvements would later be adopted by other locomotive builders. The company would construct 754 steam locomotives between 1853 and 1889. However, after William Mason's death in 1883, the firm would mostly concentrate on its core business of textile machinery. Two locomotives built by Mason have been preserved, one of which is operational. One is the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's number 25, a 4-4-0 type engine built in 1856, which was later named in honor of Mason. It is currently at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum. The other, operating locomotive is Hecla & Torch Lake Railroad Number 3, a 0-6-4 engine of the Mason Bogie design built in 1873, currently at the Henry Ford Museum. Also preserved is the tender that originally belonged to the Dalton locomotive, which the firm had built in 1864 for the United States Military Railroad. After the Civil War ended, the engine was sold, becoming the Western and Atlantic Railroad's William MacRae. When the engine was retired in 1890, its tender was salvaged and paired with the railroad's famed Texas locomotive, which had been built by Danforth, Cooke and Company.Atlanta History Center exhibit label Civil War Rifles and Printing Presses In 1861, with the start of the Civil War, Mason accepted a contract from the United States Government for the production of 100,000 Springfield model rifles. The company embarked on a large expansion to handle the new contract. However, the War Department eventually decided to cut the contract to only 30,000 rifles. After the war, the company again focused on producing high-quality textile machinery and locomotives. The factory expanded to more than near the western end of downtown Taunton. In 1879, Mason's reputation for quality workmanship let to a contract to manufacture of the Campbell printing press, originally patented and built in Brooklyn, New York. Decline and Legacy With the demise of the northern textile industry during the 1920s, Mason was reduced to producing mostly spare parts for the machines which it had sold previously to an ever-decreasing number of textile manufacturers. By the 1930s, portions of the site were occupied by Grossman's Lumber Company and the Southern New England Terminals trucking company.Sanborn Map, Taunton, Mass. 1937 The Mason Machine Works finally went out of business in 1944. Grossman's continued to occupy much of the former Mason property until the late 1960s, when the property became earmarked for demolition by the City of Taunton, as part of an urban renewal project. The site was vacated by October 1969. However, with demolition slated to begin, the complex was destroyed by fire on December 30, 1970. Today the site is occupied by a bus depot and garage, an apartment building and other businesses. A portion of the site remains open and has not been redeveloped, due to likely soil contamination issues associated with the Machine Works operations.

(10 to 18 cm) *Travel / Living Depth: 3‚Äì 35 ft. (1-12m). *Location and Distribution: Caribbean, The Bahamas, Florida, and Gulf of Mexico. Description The checkered puffer, Sphoeroides testudineus, is one of several fish species belonging to the family Tetradontidae, meaning ‚Äúfour teeth‚Äù. Puffers have four tooth plates arranged in quadrants, with two teeth on the bottom and two on the top (Carpenter 2002). These teeth form a strong, heavy beak capable of cracking through hard prey such as mollusks and crustaceans. Puffers are named for their ability to swell by swallowing water or air when threatened. They have no spinous dorsal fin, absent or reduced scales, sandpapery denticles on various areas of the body, and a reduced gill opening. Identification of species is determined in part through color, pattern, and the presence and number of spines and fleshy tabs, or lappets, on the skin (Robins & Ray 1986). The checkered puffer is pale tan to yellowish with a polygonal or square network of lines centered on a bulls-eye pattern on the midback in front of the dorsal fin. Lines are dark gray to olive, with small, dark brown spots on cheeks and lower sides. The abdomen is whitish and unmarked. Dark bands are present on the caudal fin. Potentially Misidentified Species Several species of puffers inhabit the waters of the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). In addition to S. testudineus, three other Florida puffer species belong to the genus Sphoeroides are found in the IRL. These include: the northern puffer, S. maculatus; the southern puffer, S. nephelus; and the bandtail puffer, S. spengleri. The northern puffer is olive-gray with many black spots and 6‚Äì7 vertical gray areas on the side (Robins & Ray 1986). It has a black bar between the eyes and prickles on the skin of the tail. S. maculatus grows to a maximum length of 36 cm, slightly larger than the checkered puffer. The southern puffer is similar to S. maculatus, but lacks the black spots on the sides and dorsal surface. Instead, pale tan rings or semicircles cover this area, and larger dark spots are variable on the sides. Dark slashes are sometimes present on the lower half of the cheek, and prickles are found on the posterior ventral surface near or at the anus. The bandtail puffer is usually dark brown above, with pale sides and white underneath. A row of large brownish black spots extends from the chin to the caudal-fin base on the lower sides, separate from the dark dorsal color. Many tan, fleshy tabs are present near the rear of the body. At only 18 cm, the reported maximum size for S. spengleri is much less than that of the checkered puffer. Habitat and distribution The checkered puffer ranges from Rhode Island to Florida, Bermuda, and the southeast Gulf of Mexico to the southeastern coasts of Brazil (Robins & Ray 1986). It is common in bays, seagrass beds, tidal creeks, mangrove swamps, and into freshwater areas (Figueiredo & Menezes 2000). The checkered puffer is distributed throughout the IRL. Most populations are found in association with seagrass beds and mangroves, although some individuals occur in rocky intertidal and hardbottom areas as well. Life history and population biology Age, Size, Lifespan: Information concerning the maximum age and average lifespan of S. testudineus is lacking. Growth rates vary with environmental conditions, food availability and other factors. The maximum reported size for the checkered puffer is 30 cm (Robins & Ray 1986), but most specimens are much smaller. Abundance: Little information is available on the abundance of S. testudineus. However, it is a common species found in many estuarine habitats. Juveniles are frequently caught in seagrass beds and around mangrove roots. The checkered puffer is listed as one of eight dominant fish species in coastal waters of Yucat√°n, Mexico (Vega-Cendejas & de Santillana 2004).

History Bnei Darom was established in 1949 by members of the gar'in group Netivot Kfar Darom who had been forced out of Kibbutz Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip when it was occupied by the Egyptian Army during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. They were joined by another gar'in group, Morasha from the United States, though most of its members were not prepared for the kibbutz-style life in a moshav shitufi and left, some of them to form Beit Hazon. Originally affiliated with Hapoel HaMizrachi, it joined the Religious Kibbutz Movement as a moshav shitufi in 2007. According to Walid Khalidi, Bnei Darom was founded on land belonging to Isdud.Khalidi, 1992, pp. 81, 112‚àí113 However, according to Andrew Petersen, it was on land belonging to the depopulated Palestinian village of Arab Suqrir,Petersen, 2001, p. 287 with the remains of a khan located in a wooded park next to the modern water tower. The khan ruins were first described by Victor Gu√©rin, who inspected them in 1863, and who wrote the following description: > This ruin is that of a Khan, now overthrown. It is 60 paces long by 37 > broad. It contains a cistern and a small vaulted magazine, as yet not > destroyed. Below the hillock covered by its ruins I remarked on the east a > reservoir and viaduct, a well partly fallen in, but well built.

Also cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 287 The site was registered as \\"an ancient monument\\" during the Mandate era, although the owners were permitted to build a reservoir 20m square within the khan.ATG/284 (=Antiquities Reports (held in the Palestine Archaeological Museum)), cited on Petersen, 2001, p. 287 Petersen, inspecting the place in 1994, found the place in much the same condition as during the Mandate period, except that the reservoir from the Mandate time had been now replaced with a water-tower. Petersen described the remains as comprising a nearly 40m long wall, running north-south, with an entrance near the north end. A barrel-vaulted chamber, with an interior measuring 8.3m long and 3.8m wide, is located inside the khan, just south of the entrance.Petersen, 2001, pp. 287-288 In 2002 excavations in the moshav found major remains from the Mamluk period.Barkan, 2006, Bene Darom Final Report References Bibliography  * (pp. 126-127 ) * * External links *Official website Category:Moshavim Category:Populated places established in 1949 Category:Populated places in Central District (Israel) Category:1949 establishments in Israel ","title":"Bnei Darom"},{"id":"18224461","text":"Sanogho is a town in the Garango Department of Boulgou Province in south- eastern Burkina Faso.

The RSC applied to all civil cases in the Supreme Court in England and Wales commenced after the merger of the courts of Common Law and Equity in 1883 by the Judicature Acts until they were superseded by the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) in 1999 on 26 April 1999. Civil proceedings in the county courts during this period were governed by the separate County Court Rules. The RSC were designed to replace the individual rules of the courts of Law and Equity which were subsumed into the Supreme Court providing one harmonised set of procedural rules for all civil cases. History =The original 1883 Rules= Beginning in 1873 the Judicature Acts merged the previously separate English courts of common law and equity into the new Supreme Court of Judicature made up of the Court of Appeal and High Court of Justice. The rules and procedures of the old courts and systems of law differed greatly. As common law and equity would now be applied in the same courts, the judiciary felt that there should be common procedural rules for both systems of law. The RSC were created in 1883 and were made up of Orders and Acts of Parliament. Over time the original orders and acts were supplemented by further of the same. By 1951 the RSC were made up of some 144 separate Orders and Rules and nine Acts of Parliament.The Supreme Court Practice 1967, Volume 1, Preface to the First Edition =The revised 1965 Rules= In 1951 the Evershed Committee on Supreme Court Practice and Procedure published its Second Interim Report in which it strongly recommended that \\"a complete revision of the Rules be immediately put in hand\\".Evershed Committee on Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Second Interim Report in 1951 (Cmd. 8176, para. 117) The process consisted of a Rule Committee of the Supreme Court revising and re-writing the entire body of rules governing civil procedure in the Supreme Court. The process was undertaken in two stages. First, around half of the Rules were revised and reintroduced on 1 January 1964 by R. S. C. (Revision) 1962 (SI 1962/2145). Second, the remaining original Rules were revised and reintroduced by R.S.C. (Revision) 1965 (SI 1965/1776) which also embodied the 1962 Revised Rules. This gave the Supreme Court, for the first time, one complete, integral body of procedural rules. The revised RSC came into force on 1 October 1966. Format The RSC consisted of Orders which concerned specific topics and paragraphs within each order on the specifics. For example, RSC Order 5 concerned the Mode of Beginning Proceedings in High Court, with paragraphs concerning when proceedings must be issued by writ, originating summons, originating motion or petition. Appendix A of the RSC contained Form Precedents which were compulsory in cases governed by the Rules. These included, inter alia, writs of summons, writs of subpoena, writs and notices for use in enforcement, judgements. Replacement The RSC are being gradually replaced by the CPR following the Woolf Reforms. Most of the procedural rules were replaced on 26 April 1999 when the CPR came into force. Some elements of the RSC, especially concerning enforcement of judgements, were integrated into Schedule 1 of the CPR. These are being slowly replaced by new CPR rules as the law in the areas covered by the RSC Orders is reformed. Only 11 RSC Orders now remain in CPR Schedule 1.

The band was called \\"Bee Palmer's New Orleans Rhythm Kings\\". With some personnel changes, the Rhythm Kings went on to even greater fame after parting ways with Palmer. In 1921, an alleged affair with boxing champ Jack Dempsey created a scandal and a lawsuit. Palmer is credited as co-composer of the pop song standard \\"Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone\\".

The Department of Defense Serum Repository (also referred to as the DoD Serum Repository or simply DoDSR) is a biological repository operated by the United States Department of Defense containing over 50,000,000 human serum specimens, collected primarily from applicants to and members of the United States Uniformed Services. The DoDSR is located in Silver Spring, Maryland and is operated by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC), a subordinate of the United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM), itself evolved from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. The DoDSR traces its origins to 1985 and the beginnings of the United States Armed Forces HIV screening program (originally referred to as the HTLV- III screening program), when serum remaining after periodic laboratory testing of service members was retained first by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), then later systematically archived in the Army/Navy Serum Repository, the precursor to the DoDSR. Today the DoDSR is among the largest serum repositories in the world, in terms of numbers of individuals represented, number of longitudinal specimens stored per individual, and total quantity of serum. The majority of specimens are linked to detailed medical and personnel data, creating a valuable resource for retrospective research and public health surveillance. The DoDSR's longitudinal serum, collected systematically from a large population, has enabled major contributions to understanding the etiology of many health conditions not otherwise amenable to prospective study, including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, autoimmune diseases and cancer. History The earliest serum housed in the DoDSR was collected through the Armed Forces' HLTV-III screening program, implemented in 1985 in response to the emergence of a new human virus, subsequently known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Early laboratory testing was performed via contracted private laboratories. Screening soon expanded to all civilian applicants processed at Military Entrance Processing Stations. A condition of some early laboratory testing contracts specified that remnant serum were to remain in frozen storage. In 1989, the Army's Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) awarded a contract to McKesson to consolidate and store accumulated residual serum specimens at a single facility, established in proximity to WRAIR in Rockville, Maryland. The HIV Research Program (established by Congressional Direction in 1986), under the WRAIR Division of Retrovirology, established the Walter Reed Army Serum Repository, which would evolve to become the Army/Navy Serum Repository in 1989. In 2001, the repository inventory was moved to its current location, a facility in Silver Spring, Maryland. In recent years, the DoDSR has grown by approximately 1.9RAND, p.44.-2.3 million specimens annually. By 2007, the DoDSR inventory had grown to over 44 million specimens, and by the end of 2009, over 50,000,000 specimens. =Growth of the DoDSR Inventory= HIV Seronegative Specimens The DoDSR, along with its precursor repositories, were designated as the ultimate storage facility for all serologically negative HIV specimens obtained through military HIV testing programs. Growing initially through the routine screening of all civilian applicants, and then through the continued screening of retained military personnel (at approximate two year intervals), by 1990 the DoDSR inventory had grown to contain over six million serum specimens, and by 1996 over 17 million specimens. Standardized processes in place at the contracted military HIV testing laboratories ensured efficient management of the growing inventory, permitting the DoDSR to enforce standards in specimen labelling, configuration, and shipment of specimens which facilitated their physical integration into the DoDSR inventory. Contracts for HIV testing, negotiated by the individual military services, covered all specimens shipped from Military Treatment Facilities for HIV testing within the United States; for this reason unless specifically removed, serum from military beneficiaries (i.e. spouses and children) would also find their way into the DoDSR inventory. Addition of Pre- and Post-Deployment Specimens Prompted by experiences in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, including claims by many service members of adverse health outcomes, the December, 1995 deployment of U.S. service members to Bosnia was accompanied by increased emphasis on health surveillance. A 1996 Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs memorandum mandated the collection of pre- and post-deployment serum specimens from deploying service members, and their integration into the DoDSR. The policy also directed that specimens collected for HIV surveillance could suffice. Although a small number of specimens were collected directly for health surveillance outside of existing HIV testing channels, specimens collected in this manner suffered from lack of standardization. By 1999, the Assistant Secretary of Defense issued modified instructions, which directed that the requirement for pre- and post-deployment specimens be satisfied by HIV testing. Initially, an HIV specimen was required to be collected prior to deployment if none had been collected in the year prior. Concerns over the adequacy of specimens collected for this purpose, including findings of the Rhode Island Gulf War Commission, contributed to public concern over the adequacy of existing serum collection practices. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Act called on the Department of Defense to perform > [a]n assessment of whether there is a need for changes to regulations and > standards for drawing blood samples for effective tracking and health > surveillance of the medical conditions of personnel before deployment, upon > the end of a deployment, and for a followup period of appropriate length. Additionally, this legislation required DoD to change its policies to require collection of an HIV specimen within 120 days pre-deployment and 30 days post- deployment. This change was later rescinded in conjunction with the later recommendations of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, to permit a sample collected within the year prior to deployment to meet requirements. Despite the many changes in policies, the large numbers of service members deploying in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom have led to a moderate increase in the rate of specimen acquisition and growth of the DoDSR inventory. =Evolution of the DoDSR Mission and Custody= The DoDSR has evolved from a research-affiliated repository limited to storing HIV seronegative specimens, to a repository serving a broad health surveillance mission for which it was not originally intended. The first officially articulated purpose of the DoDSR is found in a 1991 WRAIR solicitation for the management of the precursor to the DoDSR: > Sera repository operations are required for retrospective studies in support > of current and future retroviral research efforts ... Analysis of these sera > will be very important. The WRAIR solicitation anticipated as-needed specimen retrieval of up to 5,000 specimens per year. In 1995, responsibility and custody of the DoDSR inventory and its associated database was transferred from WRAIR to a newly formed subordinate command of the United States Army Medical Command, the United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM). USACHPPM, or simply CHPPM, itself evolved from the U.S. Army Industrial Hygiene Laboratory, which was initially established in 1942 at the beginning of World War II at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene, now the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The change in custody was accompanied by an increased emphasis on the epidemiologic, public health and health surveillance utility of DoDSR specimens. A DoD Instruction issued in 1997, since rescinded, described the purpose of the DoDSR as being for > medical surveillance for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological studies. The > repository shall be used exclusively for the identification, prevention, and > control of diseases associated with operational deployments of military > personnel. A subsequent DoD Directive, DoDD 6490.02E, expanded authorized uses of the DoDSR slightly: > There shall be a Department of Defense Serum Repository for medical > surveillance for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological studies. The > repository shall be used for the identification, prevention, and control of > diseases associated with military service. =Rationale for Current Practices= Responding to concerns outlined in the FY2005 Defense Authorization Act, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs requested the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB) address three questions related to the mission and operation of the DoDSR: > *Is there a sound basis for the continued routine collection of sera pre- > and post-deployment for clinical care reasons, public health surveillance or > research purposes in order to examine the effects of deployment on health? > *Should any other biological specimens be collected for clinical care > reasons, public health surveillance, or research purposes? *Are there any > valid reasons to change the time frames of specimens of collected biological > specimens either pre- or post-deployment for clinical care reasons, public > health surveillance, or research purposes? The AFEB study determined that there was sound basis for the continued collection of serum, but recommending the additional collection of white blood cells in addition to serum. The AFEB study also recommended that the DoD establish an oversight panel be created to govern access to the specimens. Neither recommendation has yet been acted on. Present DoDSR =Location= Exterior of the United States Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR), located at 11800 Tech Road, Silver Spring, MD. The DoDSR facility is located in of leased commercial space in a building located at 11800 Tech Road, Silver Spring, Maryland. The leased space was acquired through a ten-year lease managed by the General Services Administration (GSA) which expires October 1, 2010. The commercial facility is shared with two other major tenants: Holy Cross Hospital, and Comcast, whose continued occupancy precludes contiguous expansion of the DoDSR inventory. Due to space constraints at the existing facility, relocation of the DoDSR inventory to another location in the Baltimore - National Capital region (including Ft. Meade, Maryland) was considered as early as 2005.FedBizOpps.gov, 2005. Considerations under BRAC Although AFHCS maintains technical and computing facilities supporting the DoDSR at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Washington, D.C. and is subject to realignment under the recommendations of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission, published BRAC recommendations do not specify a location to which the facilities must relocate. Relocation of the WRAMC AFHSC facilities are necessary by September 15, 2011. =Contracted Operation= The DoDSR is operated by Thermo Fisher Scientific under a no-bid or \\"sole-source\\" contractFedBizOpps.gov, 2006. awarded in 2006. An earlier no-bid contract was awarded to Cryonix in 2005, although Cryonix was later incorporated under Thermo Electron Corporation's Biorepository Services division. Thermo Electron subsequently merged with Fisher Scientific in 2006. Thermo Fisher's Fisher BioServices business currently holds the contract. =Freezer Equipment= The DoDSR consists of 15 large walk-in freezers, each approximately x 30 feet x 10 high, whose interiors are maintained at -30 ¬∞C by pairs of compressors. =Serum Storage= Interior of one of 15 of the large walk-in freezers in the DoDSR. The majority of serum specimens are stored inside the walk-in freezers in cardboard boxes, approximately 6 x 18 x in size, each containing 308 specimens, and each consisting of approximately 2.5 mL of frozen serum The cardboard boxes are sequentially numbered and labeled, and stored on metal shelving units within the walk-in freezers for ready accessibility and retrieval. Due to storage constraints, approximately 5.5 million specimens from two walk-in freezers were placed into \\"high-density\\" configuration in 2006, and additional reconfiguration may be required. The current operations contract calls for the contractor to \\"adjust the storage configurations of specimens in one or more freezers to accommodate high-density, boxed specimen storage\\" as required. =Transportation of Specimens to the DoDSR= The majority of specimens are received quarterly in frozen form, following completion of all HIV testing.FedBizOpps, 2006. Shipments arrive in pallets transported in a freezer truck from the major contracted testing laboratory, ViroMed, which is located in Minnetonka, Minnesota. In 2008, the DoDSR procured a specialized freezer truck to transport specimens to the DoDSR, and solicited a bid for more frequent transport of specimens to the repository .FedBizOpps.gov, 2008. Data Linkages DoDSR inventory data and related information are stored in an Oracle database referred to as the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS),Rubertone & Brundage, p.1902. which serves as the \\"sole link\\" to the DoDSR inventory.US Medicine, 2003. Serum specimens are identified by a unique specimen identification number,AFHSC 2003, p.4. which for the majority of specimens are linked to the Social Security Number of the donor, and the date the specimen was obtained. In addition to inventory data, DMSS also integrates select medical outcomes data available through the Military Health System (MHS), including International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9CM) diagnosis codes, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, and other pertinent administrating data from inpatient and outpatient encountered provided directly by the MHS or through Tricare managed care services. Active duty component service members (unlike service members in the Reserve components), are entitled to free (or nearly free) health care for the duration of their military service, the details of which are captured electronically in DMSS. The active duty component thus constitutes a cohort where health events can be assessed longitudinally with minimal ascertainment bias. Over half of the specimens in the DoDSR are traceable to service members who have been on active duty, and 75% of active duty service members have provided three or more longitudinal specimens. Limited additional health and personnel data linked to DoDSR specimens include records of immunizations, overseas deployments, military assignment data, and records from pre- and post-deployment health assessments. =Links to Other Available Data= Significant additional MHS administrative and clinical data exist which are not integrated into DMSS. These include: *Records of pharmaceuticals dispensed at MHS outpatient pharmacies and through the outsourced civilian retail and mail-order pharmacy, available through the DoD Pharmacoeconomics Center's (PEC) Pharmacy Data Transaction Service (PDTS). *Records of Health Level 7 (HL7) coded results of microbiology, chemistry, and hematology laboratory tests, available through the MHS. * Family history, risk factor data, available through the MHS Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) Electronic Medical Record system. * Information on confirmed cancer diagnoses available in the Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR). Recent AFHSC solicitations have requested additional staff to address these data shortfalls. =Linkages to Other DoD Biological Repositories= The Department of Defense, through the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology operates the AFIP Tissue Repository, which contains approximately 3 million case files and associated paraffin blocks, microscopic glass slides, and formalin-fixed tissue specimens from pathologic examinations occurring throughout the Military Health System. Thousands of cases are added to the repository each year. With the disestablishment of the AFIP under Base Realignment and Closure, management of the Tissue Repository was to have been transferred to the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.GAO 2007, p.30. However, Public Law 110-181 Section 722DHB 2008, p.1. directed the President to establish a Joint Pathology Center, which would subsume responsibility for the AFIP Tissue Repository. A Joint Pathology Center Working Group Concept of Operations stated that: > The JPC ... will provide maintenance/modernization of the Tissue Repository > in support of the mission of the DoD and other federal agencies. In its review of the JPC Working Group Concept of Operations, the Defense Health Board emphasized that: > Every effort must be pursued to guarantee that the Tissue Repository is > preserved, implements world-class modernization, and is utilized > appropriately. A recent independent report by Asterand (Detroit, MI) > submitted to Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences found the > repository to have a commercial value of $3.0-$3.6 Billion ... Despite the utility of linking AFIP Tissue Repository specimens to longitudinal pre-diagnostic serum available in the DoDSR, no formal linkage of the AFIP Tissue Repository inventory has yet been made to DMSS or to the DoDSR. No estimate is yet available on the potential commercial value of such a formal linkage. Permitted Uses of DoDSR Specimens Requests for access to DoDSR specimens are governed by guidelines developed by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center. According to guidelines, \\" [t]he Director of the repository is solely responsible for authorizing releases of specimens from the repository.\\"AFHSC 2003, p.5. =Research= DoDSR specimens may only be released to principal investigators outside the Department of Defense for purposes of medical research if the proposed study has \\"a coinvestigator who is assigned to the Department of Defense and is knowledgeable, responsible, and accountable for all aspects of the study's design and execution (including data management, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results).\\"AFHSC 2003, p.9. =Clinical Care= Serum from the DoDSR may be requested by clinicians within the Military Health System to aid diagnosis and guide clinical management. Serum may also be released to clinicians outside the Military Health System provided a physician in the Military Health System in the same specialty as the requestor validates the clinical relevance of the requested use prior to the release of any serum.AFHSC 2003, p.10. =Criminal Investigations= Serum specimens from the DoDSR may be used for criminal investigations and prosecutions if directed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.AFHSC 2003, p.11. Other Issues =Informed Consent= DoDSR specimens are collected without informed consent, and specimen donors are not informed of the use of their specimens in subsequent studies. Specimens retrieved by the DoDSR for use in external research studies are, with rare exceptions, deidentified prior to being sent to outside investigators. =Genetic Testing= A 1996 memorandum specifically stated that DoDSR specimens collected for pre- and post-deployment health surveillance \\"will not be used for any genetics related testing\\". =Civilian and Beneficiary Serum= As a result of clinically indicated HIV testing performed on civilians and family beneficiaries at Military Treatment Facilities (eligible for health care within the Military Health System), approximately 900,000 serum specimens from individuals not directly affiliated with the Uniformed Services through application or service are also stored in the DoDSR.RAND 2008, p.44. In Privacy Act documentation, DoD acknowledges that the AFHSC maintains \\"...specimen collections (remaining serum from blood samples) from which serologic tests can be performed...\\" from categories of individuals which include \\"Department of Defense military personnel (active and reserve) and their family members...\\".Federal Register, 2009. =Destruction of Specimens= DoDSR guidelines are silent as to whether a mechanism exists for specimen donors to request destruction or removal of their specimens from the repository.AFHSC 2003. In Privacy Act documentation, DoD states that \\"[r]ecords are destroyed when no longer needed for reference and for conducting business\\", but no formal mechanism is articulated for the destruction or specimens. This is in contrast to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology DNA Repository (also known as the Repository of Specimen Samples for the Identification of Remains) which articulates a mechanism for donors to request the destruction of their specimens following separation from service. =RAND Study on the Role of the DoDSR in Pandemic Influenza Preparedness= On May 1, 2009, during the early stages of the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak, an unpublished RAND study, originally commissioned in 2006 by USACHPPM was published in its entirety on WikiLeaks. The leaked documents included a justification for the $500,000 contract cost, directly authorized by former Surgeon General of the United States Army Kevin C. Kiley on August 4, 2006, which stated the study and its 12-month timetable for delivery was necessary > ... to describe the current and future capabilities of the Department of > Defense Serum Repository to assist with the early identification and > response to an influenza pandemic. Adequate resources are not available in- > house to perform these analyses in sufficient time to prepare for a pandemic > ... Despite the leaked study draft's publication date of May 2008, at the time of the leak and outbreak in May 2009, RAND listed the study as a \\"current project\\", noting in its description that \\"the threat of an emerging human pandemic [has] highlighted the importance of a comprehensive U.S. Armed Forces health surveillance architecture\\". Around the time of the leaked documents' appearance on WikiLeaks, the lead author of the unpublished RAND study published an op-ed piece in The Baltimore Sun describing the control of the outbreak a concern of \\"national security\\", and highlighting the need to \\"marshal the best ... institutional strengths ... to prevent, detect and respond effectively to this latest infectious disease\\".

The name has two origins. In some cases it can originate from a nickname, derived from the Scottish Gaelic word creag, meaning \\"rock,\\" similar to Peter. In other cases, the given name originates from the Scottish surname Craig, which is also derived from the same Scottish Gaelic word. Cognate forms of creag include the Irish creig, Manx creg, and Welsh craig. The English word \\"crag\\" also shares an origin with these Celtic words. The given name Craig is popular in Scotland, and is used throughout the English speaking world, though in North America it is often pronounced with a short vowel sound, as in \\"egg\\", while the British pronunciation sounds like the diphthong in \\"brain\\".

He was a dedicated socialist and a man with a highly developed social conscience. Many of his later works depict the struggles and plight of ‚Äòthe man in the street‚Äô. In 1925, he decided to produce lithographs to make art available at a reasonable price to the working class. He also gave free private art and music lessons to gifted students who could not afford the tuition. His art oeuvre is varied, ranging from oil paintings, water colours, wood cuts and lithographs to political posters, ex-libris and magazine and book covers and illustrations. He also received regular commissions from the City of Amsterdam for monumental art. His music was at least as important to him as his art. His instrument was the clarinet but he also played the oboe. He regularly performed with Amsterdam‚Äôs Concertgebouw Orchestra but refused a permanent position. In his last years his music took precedence over his art. A major exhibition of his works in the Museum of Modern Art in Arnhem, The Netherlands, in 2005/06 (see 'Chronology') was accompanied by the publication of a book highlighting his life and his artistic career as well as his music career. The book also contained a catalogue of all his known oeuvre. A second edition of this book, revised, updated and much expanded, was published early in 2015 and is now available in the bookstores of various art museums in Holland. Its language is Dutch.

Both models featured a four-cylinder, two-valve air-cooled engine design with a capacity of 1,089 cc. This engine was an evolution of the powerplant used in the previous Kz1000 series, itself descended from the Z1. In 1983 the GPz1100 was completely revamped in both cosmetic styling, suspension and updated engine. The model number changed to ZX1100A1. Model differences Cosmetically, both the B1 and B2 were released in a bright red paint called \\"Firecracker Red\\", the B2 was also available in a gold colour called \\"Sonic Gold\\". The red colour theme was a departure from early colour schemes and started the marketing campaign called the \\"Red Revolution\\" featuring the 1100, 900, 750 and 550 models. =Handlebars= The B1 had conventional 7/8\\" handlebars as found on all earlier Kawasaki \\"Z\\" series bikes, the B2 had clip on style handlebars that mounted to the top of the fork tube above the top triple clamp, this style then featured on the later ZX1100A models. This style was to continue to be the norm for most sports bikes, especially the Kawasaki GPZ900R series released in 1984. =Instruments= The Instruments on the B1 used bulbs for all warning lights and featured a speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge and voltage meter. The B2 instrument panel feature the speedometer and tachometer but the fuel gauge and most of the warning indicators were replaced with an LCD. The design change also changed the wiring harness and a number of electrical connectors in the front of the motorcycle changed. The speedometer on the B1 is electronic while the B2 is cable driven. The transducer appears to generate a pulse train that is converted to a voltage to feed the speedo meter.z1100 Factory Service Manual 1981 =Brakes= The front disks of the B1 are 10 mm smaller in diameter and 1 mm thinner than the B2, the front calipers are also different but the disk brake pads are the same. The rear disks are identical in both models. The front forks are slightly different between the two models. Both models feature air assistance, but the B1 model uses an air valve located at the top of the fork leg while the B2 uses an equaliser tube linking the two tube with a single air valve. By using an equaliser tube, each inner fork tube requires a small hole to allow the air in. The lower legs are different as the different brake disk diameter used on the two models require the mounting points to be different. =Fuel injection system= The B1 and B2 models both featured Fuel Injection manufactured by Japan Electronic Control Systems (JECS). However the 2 systems are quite different in fuel system management. The B1 model used the EFI system, where the B2 model used the later DFI system, which is a fully digitised form of electronic fuel injection. The EFI system used on the B1 model was built under licence from Bosch and is essentially a copy of the Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection system used on many motor vehicles in the late 70's and early 80's including Nissan vehicles. The B1 model fuel injection system is very similar to the 1980 Z1000H (Limited Edition model, only 1000 made by the Kawasaki factory) and also used in the 1980 US-only Z1000G model). This fuel injection system is a very simple analogue design that uses an air flow meter to determine engine air flow. The ECU then controls the amount of time that the fuel injectors remain open based on the signal received from the air-flow meter. This style of analogue fuel injection only has a limited number of engine management sensors, including engine temperature, incoming air temperature, engine RPM, engine air-flow and throttle position. The B1 model uses an air-flow meter that is approximately 10% larger than the Z1000H air flow meter, to provide more air flow to the larger capacity motor. Later models (B2 and ZX1100A)featured DFI (digital) fuel injection - this style of DFI uses a variable TPS which more accurately represents the throttle position than the earlier EFI, for sending signals to the ECU. The algorithm used in the B2 and ZX1100A models is Alpha-N. The DFI models also used a limited number of engine inputs for fuel system management. While the DFI system used on the later models is tehcnically better than the earlier EFI system, the earlier fuel injection systems provide a more direct throttle response as the ECU is responding to actual air-flow through the motor, not to a pre-determined fuel map based mainly on throttle position alone. On the B1 model (as per the Z1000H and Z1000G models), the four fuel injectors are mounted directly into the cylinder head above the inlet ports (hence the EFI system was referred to as port injection), while the B2/A (DFI) model had the more common Throttle Body Injection (TBI) where the injectors are mounted into the throttle bodies. With different throttle bodies comes a very slight difference in the air box mounting. The intake rubbers on the B1 are smaller than the B2 but a throttle body swap is possible by simply replacing the inlet rubbers. =Fuel system= The fuel level sender units are physically different between the two models, this could be due to the different methods used to report the fuel level (B1‚Äìgauge, B2‚ÄìLCD). The B1 model has a fuel sender with a round tank mounting, the B2 has a rectangular mounting plate, therefore the tanks are different also. The DFI and EFI fuel delivery hardware is the same for all models from Z1000H through to ZX1100A models. The 1983 model also uses the same fuel pump and throttle bodies as the B2. The diameter of the throttle-bodies on all fuel-injected Kawasaki models is the same, at 36mm. =Body parts= The B2 model featured a bikini fairing. This resulted in a change in a number of cosmetic covers and the addition of extra mounting brackets. Because of the bikini fairing, the headlight assembly is slightly different between the two models. The frames are basically the same with a few subtle differences in the fasteners used. The tail light of the B2 features a reflector on each side of the rear lens. The internals of the lens are also different between the two models. The tail light lens feature identical mounting, so they can be interchanged. The B1 was only released in 1981 and the B2 in 1982, after that, the dual shock 1100 models ended and the monoshock GPz1100(ZX1100-A1) were released.

Authorities arrange for a psychologist to help her regain her memory of the delivery. Soon, Daniel bites Lenore when she feeds him, revealing his taste for blood. Daniel begins to attack small animals and progresses to killing adult humans. Lenore refuses to accept that her baby is a cannibalistic killer. Frank comes home from work to find Lenore sitting in the baby's room, but Daniel is not in his crib. The electricity goes off. Frank goes to check the fuse and at the same time searches for Daniel in the basement. Then he finds himself locked in. Daniel kills Marco, the police officer who came with Sergeant Perkins.

It is a tick-borne disease, caused by Theileria annulata. The vector ticks are of the genus Hyalomma. The most prominent symptoms are fever and lymph node enlargement. But there is a wide range of clinical manifestations, especially in enzootic areas. Among them, the Doukkala area of Morocco, where the epidemiology and symptomatology of the disease were minutely studied. N. EL HAJ, M. KACHANI, M. BOUSLIKHANE, H. OUHELLI, A.T. AHAMI, J. KATENDE et S.P. MORZARIA. S√©ro-√©pid√©miologie de la theil√©riose √† Theileria annulata et de la bab√©siose √† Babesia bigemina au Maroc. The disease was once considered as \\"benign\\" in the literature, in comparison to East Coast fever. With the introduction of European breeds into the region, however, it could become of major economic incidence. With mortalities up to 50 to 80 percent in the 1980s (L. Mahin). An efficient treatment with parvaquone, then buparvaquone became available in many countries from the mid-1990s. Animals native to endemic areas appear more tolerant to the disease, buffalos especially, appear less susceptible.Theileriosis - Cattle reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 11 October 2011.  Clinical signs  A high temperature (41.2¬∞C) is a common feature in acute cases. Body temperature is regularly higher than in any other cattle disease. Fever from 41 to 42¬∞C is common in acute stages. Later on (day 5 to day 10 from the clinical onset), temperature will lower to a normal range (38.0‚Äì39.5¬∞C), but the disease will continue to progress, despite a possible apparent clinical improvement (appetite comes back). Afterwards, from D10 to D15, there is a downfall stage, with hypothermia (37 to 38¬∞C), anemia, jaundice, and heart failure. Such animals rarely recover, even with intensive treatment. Lymph nodes are commonly enlarged and there may be episodes of blood from the nose, difficulty breathing and weight loss. Other signs, but not present in all cases are : * Blood-tinged diarrhea, or with obvious blood clots. * Bruxism(grinding of teeth) can be seen * Circular raised patches of hair all over the body * Haemorrhages in the ocular and vaginal mucous membranes * A degree of anaemia Diarrhea with blood clots in a calf  Diagnosis  Lymph node enlargement in six-months-old calves in asymptomatic infestation Lymph node enlargement and even hyperthermia can occur asymptomatically in enzootic area, during the disease season. Clinical signs, including lymph node enlargement, anaemia, hyperthermia and history of tick infestation can lead to a suspicion of theileriosis Definitive diagnosis relies on the observation of the pirolplasm stages of the organism in the erythrocytes in blood smears stained with Romanowsky stains. Lymph node aspirates can also be examined for the presence of 'Kock's Blue Bodies' which are schizont stages in lymphocytes. Necropsy reveals 'punched out ulcers' in the abomasum and greyish raised 'infarcts' on kidneys. Numerous serological tests like ELISA, and indirect immunofluorescence test and PCR can also help diagnosis. Theileria-annulata-piroplasms-cattle Treatment and control Buparvaquone, halofuginone and tetracycline and butalex and oxytetracycline have all shown to be effective. Tick control should be considered, but resistance to parasiticide products may be increasing. There are various options for controlling ticks of domestic animals, including: topical application of parasiticidal chemicals in dip baths or spray races or pour-on formulations, spraying parasiticides on walls of cattle pens, and rendering the walls of cattle pens smooth with mortar to stop ticks molting there. Selection of cattle for good ability to acquire immune resistance to ticks is potentially effective. Endemic stability is a state where animals are affected at a low levels or not as susceptible to the disease, and this may be encouraged in endemic areas. Vaccination is available and should be performed in breeds that are susceptible to infection. Live attenuated vaccine are being used in many countries like India, Iran, Turkey etc. Which is a basically a Lymphocyte infected with Theileria annulata schizont stage and passaged for attenuation.

Although said to have had the strength equal to that of ten elephants, in his younger days Nimala preferred to stay idle at home while his brothers worked in the family‚Äôs paddy fields. When an order was issued by the King to send one male to serve in his army, Nimala‚Äôs brothers picked him to be sent, feeling that he was no use to the family. After joining a company south of the Mahaweli River under a prince named Digabhaya, Nimala was sent on an errand to deliver a message to a Brahmin. Having set off at dawn, Nimala is said to have finished the journey in a few hours, covering a distance of thirty four leagues. Astounded at this feat, the Brahmin had him sent to King Kavantissa to serve directly under him. After meeting the king, Nimala was ordered to sharpen some swords as a test, which he performed extremely well. The king was impressed by his skills, and Nimala was taken to serve under the king, and became one of the ten giant warriors who were the chief commanders and champions of the king‚Äôs army. Being named as Suranimala After King Kavantissa‚Äôs death, his successor and son Dutugemunu began the war against the South Indian King Elara who was then in control of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Elara‚Äôs forces were gradually defeated and Dutugemunu‚Äôs forces approached Anuradhapura, where the final battle would take place. As a test before the final battle, the king addressed his men and asked them men to drink from a large vessel of toddy. Seeing that none accepted this challenge, Nimala drank all the toddy emptied the vessel. After this incident he was known as Suranimala, the word sura meaning liquor. Battle of Vijithapura Suranimala played a key role in the decisive battle for one of King Elara‚Äôs last strongholds, the fortress of Vijithapura. Along with Nandimitra and the King‚Äôs elephant, he attacked the southern gate of the fortress. Not desiring to enter the fortress from the opening the Elephant had made, he leaped over the wall.http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap025.html#24 Mahavamsa - CHAPTER XXV Once inside, he is said to have fought the enemy using a large sword. He also defeated king Elara‚Äôs champion Dighajantu, thus saving Dutugemunu whom Dighajantu was seeking to kill. This event ultimately led to the retreat of king Elara‚Äôs forces and Elara‚Äôs death at the hands of Dutugemunu. At this final battle, Suranimala stood on king Dutugemunu's left, protecting him.http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/kings/dutugemunu.htm King Dutugemunu Soon after the defeat of Elara, king Dutugemunu‚Äôs forces had to fight another battle against Bhalluka, a cousin of Elara. Suranimala along with the ten giants played a key part here as well.

The company operated throughout the Central Highlands of Vietnam during the war, from arrival in September 1962 until deactivation in November 1970. Originally designated the 81st Transportation Company (equipped with twin-rotor CH-21 \\"Flying Banana\\" piston-engined helicopters), the company was reorganized in 1963 as the 119th Assault Helicopter Company (Airmobile), re-equipped with turbine-powered single-rotor UH-1A and B model Hueys. Also known as the 119th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter), the company's area of operations included the entire Central Highlands of Vietnam, plus large portions of Laos and Cambodia. Eventually assigned to the 52nd Combat Aviation Battalion, 17th Combat Aviation Group, 1st Aviation Brigade and headquartered at Camp Holloway in Pleiku, the company was also based at Camp Radcliff for a short time from late in 1969 to 1970. The unit was attacked twice by People's Army of Vietnam sappers while at Camp Radcliff, once in each year. The Company was equipped with 16 to 20 lightly armed UH-1 \\"slick\\" troopships, and by 1969 all UH-1Ds were upgraded to more- powerful UH-1H models and approximately 8 Huey UH-1C model gunships. The \\"slick\\" troopships used the radio callsign \\"Alligator\\" or \\"Gator\\", the gunships used the callsign \\"Crocodiles\\" or \\"Crocs\\". The callsigns that the pilots used were atypical for US Army aviation units of the time, instead of standard callsigns such as \\"Blue four-one\\" or \\"Yellow six,\\" the pilots used nicknames. The company at one time also used the callsign called \\"Black Dragon,\\" from which the 52nd CABn \\"Flying Dragon\\" callsign evolved. The total company strength of approximately 225 included 50 to 60 pilots and an equal number of crewmembers, plus field maintenance and other critical support personnel. During over eight years in Vietnam, the 119th Assault Helicopter Company provided helicopter support for the US Army 4th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 173d Airborne Brigade, US Marine Corps, United States Army Special Forces and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

While many are also preserved in a similar fashion to the Burgess Shale, the term \\"Burgess Shale type fauna\\" covers assemblages based on taxonomic criteria only. Extent The fauna of the middle Cambrian has a cosmopolitan range. All assemblages preserving soft-part anatomy have a very similar fauna, even though they span almost every continent. The wide distribution has been attributed to the advent of pelagic larvae. Composition The fauna is composed of a range of soft bodied organisms; creatures with hard, mineralised skeletons are rare, although trilobites are quite commonly found. The major soft-bodied groups are sponges, palaeoscolecid worms, lobopods, arthropods and anomalocaridids. Assemblages are typically diverse, with the most famous localities each containing in the region of 150 described species. The fauna of the Burgess Shale lived in the photic zone, as bottom-dwelling photosynthesisers are present in the assemblage. Example faunas =Sirius Passet fauna= Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet, viewed from the top, with the head to the right. The shaded areas on the lobes are thought to have functioned as gills. Sirius Passet is a lagerst√§tte in Greenland which was formed about 527 million years ago. Its most common fossils are arthropods, but there is only a handful of trilobite species. There are also very few species with hard parts: trilobites, hyoliths, sponges, brachiopods, and no echinoderms or molluscs. Halkieria has features associated with more than one living phylum, and is discussed below. The strangest-looking animals from Sirius Passet are Pambdelurion and Kerygmachela. They are generally regarded as anomalocarids because they have long, soft, segmented bodies with a pair of broad fin-like flaps on most segments and a pair of segmented appendages at the rear. The outer parts of the top surfaces of the flaps have grooved areas which are thought to have acted as gills. Under each flap there is a short, fleshy leg. This arrangement suggests the animals are related to biramous arthropods. =Chengjiang fauna= There are several Cambrian fossil sites in the Chengjiang county of China's Yunnan province. The most significant is the Maotianshan shale, a lagerst√§tte which preserves soft tissues very well. The Chengjiang fauna date to between 525 million and 520 million years ago, about the middle of the early Cambrian epoch, a few million years after Sirius Passet and at least 10 million years earlier than the Burgess Shale. The Chengjiang sediments provide what are currently the oldest known chordates, the phylum to which all vertebrates belong. The 8 chordate species include Myllokunmingia, possibly a very primitive agnathid and Haikouichthys, which may be related to lampreys. Yunnanozoon may be the oldest known hemichordate. Anomalocaris was a mainly soft-bodied swimming predator which was gigantic for its time (up to 70 cm = 2 feet long; some later species were 3 times as long); the soft, segmented body had a pair of broad fin-like flaps along each side, except that the last 3 segments had a pair of fans arranged in a V shape. Unlike Kerygmachela and Pambdelurion (see above), Anomalocaris apparently had no legs, and the grooved patches which are thought to have acted as gills were at the bases of the flaps, or even overlapping on to its back. The two eyes were on relatively long horizontal stalks; the mouth lay under the head and was a round-cornered square of plates which could not close completely; and in front of the mouth were two jointed appendages which were shaped like a shrimp's body, curved backwards and with short spines on the inside of the curve. Amplectobelua, also found at Chengjiang, was similar, smaller than Anomalocaris but considerably larger than most other Chengjiang animals. Both are thought to have been powerful predators. Hallucigenia looks like a long-legged caterpillar with spines on its back, and almost certainly crawled on the seabed. Nearly half of the Chengjiang fossil species are arthropods, few of which had the hard, mineral-reinforced exoskeletons found in most later marine arthropods; only about 3% of the organisms known from Chengjiang have hard shells, and most of those are trilobites (although Misszhouia is a soft-bodied trilobite). Many other phyla are found there: Porifera (sponges) and Priapulida (burrowing \\"worms\\" which were ambush predators), Brachiopoda (these had bivalve-like shells, but fed by means of a lophophore, a fan-like filter which occupied about of half of the internal space), Chaetognatha (arrow worms), Cnidaria, Ctenophora (comb jellies), Echinodermata, Hyolitha (Lophophorata with small conical shells), Nematomorpha, Phoronida (horseshoe worms), and Protista. =Burgess Shale= Anomalocaridid \\"arm\\" from the Walcott Quarry, Burgess Shale, Middle Cambrian, British Columbia, Canada. The Burgess Shale was the first of the Cambrian lagerst√§tten to be discovered (by Walcott in 1909), and the re-analysis of the Burgess Shale by Whittington and others in the 1970s was the basis of Gould's book Wonderful Life, which was largely responsible for non-scientists' awareness of the Cambrian explosion. The fossils date from the mid Cambrian, about 515 million years ago and 10 million years later than the Chengjiang fauna. The shelled fossils in the Burgess Shale are similar in proportions to other shelly fossil deposits; however, they are a minor component of the biota, accounting for only 14% of the Burgess Shale fossils. When organisms that were not preserved are entered into the equation, the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Arthropods are the most abundant and diverse group of organisms in the Burgess Shale, followed closely by sponges. Many Burgess Shale fossils are unusual and difficult to classify, for example: *Marrella is the most common fossil, but Whittington's re-analysis showed that it belonged to none of the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans, chelicerates). *Yohoia was a tiny animal (7 mm to 23 mm long) with: a head shield; a slim, segmented body covered on top by armor plates; a paddle-like tail; 3 pairs of legs under the head shield; a single flap-like appendage fringed with setae under each body segment, probably used for swimming and/or respiration; a pair of relatively large appendages at the front of the head shield, each with a pronounced \\"elbow\\" and ending in four long spines which may have functioned as \\"fingers\\". Yohoia is assumed to have been a mainly benthic (bottom-dwelling) creature that swam just above the ocean floor and used its appendages to scavenge or capture prey. It may be a member of the arachnomorphs, a group of arthropods that includes the chelicerates and trilobites. *Naraoia was a soft-bodied animal which is classified as a trilobite because its appendages (legs, mouth-parts) are very similar. *Waptia, Canadaspis and Plenocaris had bivalve-like carapaces. It is uncertain whether these animals are related or acquired bivalve-like carapaces by convergent evolution. *Molaria was a chelicerate-like arthropod with a long, narrow tail. *Pikaia resembled the modern lancelet, and was the earliest known chordate until the discovery of the fish-like Myllokunmingia and Haikouichthys among the Chengjiang fauna. Reconstruction of Opabinia, one of the strangest animals from the Burgess Shale But the \\"weird wonders\\", creatures that resembled nothing known in the 1970s, attracted the most publicity, for example: *Whittington's first presentation about Opabinia made the audience laugh.Palaeontology‚Äôs hidden agenda The reconstruction showed a soft-bodied animal with: a slim, segmented body; a pair of flap-like appendages on each segment with gills above the flaps, except that the last 3 segments had no gills and the flaps formed a tail; five stalked eyes; a backward-facing mouth under the head; a long, flexible, hose-like proboscis which extended from under the front of the head and ended in a \\"claw\\" fringed with spines. Subsequent research has concluded that Opabinia is a lobopod, closely related to the arthropods and possibly even closer to ancestors of the arthropods. *Anomalocaris and Hallucigenia were first found in the Burgess Shale, but older specimens have been found in the Chengjiang fauna. They are now regarded as lobopods, and Anomalocaris is very similar to Opabinia in most respects (except the eyes and feeding mechanisms) ‚Äì see above. *Odontogriphus is currently regarded as either a mollusc or a lophotrochozoan, i.e. fairly closely related to the ancestors of molluscs (see above). =Other fauna= Other fauna include the Middle Cambrian Wheeler Shale Formation of Utah.  Ichnofauna  Trace fossils are associated with many Burgess Shale-type deposits. They are often associated with the innards of soft-bodied organisms,e.g. and are particularly prevalent under the carapaces of bivalved arthropods. Burrowing organisms seem to have used the high-sulfur decay fluids as a nutrient source when farming bacteria in the microenvironment under the carapaces, indicated by their repeated uses of individual burrows.

He was born and died in L√∂rrach, Baden-W√ºrttemberg.Opac; NDB Working initially in an Art Nouveau style, he was perhaps the most important figure in the relatively small German contribution to the art pottery movement, though he was a designer and decorator rather than a hands-on potter. As an architect he specialized in comfortable private houses, parks and public gardens, mostly in Germany. He was one of the founders of the Deutscher Werkbund in 1907.NDB; Junghanns, Kurt, Der Deutsche Werkbund. Sein erstes Jahrzehnt., p. 140, 1982, Berlin Life Tiles salvaged from his Het Kareol villa in Aerdenhout, Netherlands, 1911 From 1881 to 1884 he studied painting and interior design at the school of decorative arts in Karlsruhe, and was later professor of interior and garden design at the university there (now the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) from 1894 until 1933. In German sources he is often given his professorial title, in the German way. He travelled to Italy in 1891, and then lived in Paris, where he studied painting at the private Acad√©mie Julian in 1891‚Äì92. Other major travels were to Rome and North Africa in 1905, and Spain, studying Islamic ceramics there, in 1912.Opac; NDB Between 1937 and 1939 he published a history of art in three volumes.Opac Pottery Vase, Karlsruhe, 1921‚Äì25 He first became interested in pottery in 1885, visiting the Mayer pottery in Karlsruhe, and another, Manufakture Tonwerke, in Kandern in the Black Forest. He began to have his designs produced in Kandern from 1897, when Art Nouveau was already the dominant style trend, and continued to use the pottery there until 1914. By 1898 his pieces were on sale at the Paris shop of Siegfried Bing, \\"Maison de l'Art Nouveau\\" (\\"House of New Art\\"), which had given the movement its name. Later his works were sold at the German critic Julius Meier-Graefe's competitive gallery in Paris, La Maison Moderne (1897‚Äì1903).Opac His works won gold medals at both the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900) and the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904.Opac These and smaller events were important for raising the profile of potters, especially those working in backwoods locations. Much later, in 1928 he won a bronze medal in the art competitions of the Amsterdam Olympic Games for his Hamburg Stadtpark.Max Laeuger's profile at Sports Reference.com In 1916 he took over the former premises of the Staatliche Majolika Manufaktur Karlsruhe to create his own pottery atelier; this was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1944,Opac after which (at the age of 80) he returned to L√∂rrach for his remaining years.

Perhaps his major commission was for the huge villa Het Kareol, allegedly the largest private house built in the Netherlands in the 20th century, demolished in 1979, though some fragments survive. He started work there in 1907, and the project was completed in 1911. As well as the house, he designed the tiling which was a prominent feature of both the interior and exterior, and also the large gardens, now a public park. The Villa K√ºchlin in Horben in the Black Forest was another country house, still rather large, and he designed a number of other houses for the wealthy.NDB The Hamburg Stadtpark was a highly prestigious commission, designed to give Hamburg a large central park along the lines of Munich's Englischer Garten, Berlin's Tiergarten, London's Hyde Park and Regent's Park, or New York's Central Park. A contest was held in 1908 for designs, which became bedevilled by \\"conflicts and secret maneuvers\\", exposing differing views on park design, as well as personal rivalries. No first prize was given, but Laeuger's design was one of three second prizes. After a period of tussling between several figures, including some very underhand dealing by the young Leberecht Migge, a compromise scheme was adopted, which pleased nobody. Laeuger rather bitterly saw it as his scheme stripped of some of its more architectural and expensive elements.Haney, 55‚Äì60 Between 1909 and 1912 he worked on the G√∂nneranlage estate in Baden-Baden, whose gardens, filled with sculpture and roses, are now a public park.Herrmann, Barbara, Baden-Baden, deine Mystik ist die Eleganz: Ein lebendiger Spaziergang in die Gegenwart mit einem Blick in die Vergangenheit (in German), 2016, TWENTYSIX, , 9783740706173, google books; NDB From 1922 to 1925 he worked on the existing Wasserkunstanlage Paradies (\\"Paradise water- garden\\"), also in Baden-Baden, notably adding a sloping cascade of water in a sinuous Art Nouveau style. The Max-Laeuger Platz by the entrance is named in his honour.Park website In 1933 he designed a public memorial in Mannheim for Carl Benz (1844‚Äì1929), founder of Mercedes-Benz. Benz was an alumnus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology where Laeuger was a professor, and Laeuger also designed the architectural setting for a bust there of the former professor Heinrich Hertz, after whom the electrical unit is named. He designed stained-glass windows for St. Paul's Church, Basel.

He had an English public school education in Buenos Aires. After studying piano since the age of five, as well as theory and composition, he did further superior musical studies at the Juilliard School of New York. Although Peyronel grew up all over the World, including the United States, he considers London his home. Early years Danny Peyronel made his debut with the Heavy Metal Kids at London's Marquee Club in 1973. After recording two albums, followed by subsequent tours, Peyronel left the Kids in 1975 to join UFO, as their first keyboard player, where he also sang harmony vocals. Peyronel contributed to the songwriting as well, e.g. \\"Highway Lady\\" from the No Heavy Petting album. UFO later released a live album from the period when Danny Peyronel was in the band called On with the Action, which was recorded live at London's The Roundhouse. His songs from that period have been included in several UFO compilations and an EMI re-issue of No Heavy Petting, credited him as the initiator of a change in the band's direction, which continued after his departure. After leaving UFO in July 1976 following several tours on the US, Europe and the UK, Peyronel formed his own band, The Blue Max, and recorded their self titled album for Charisma Records alongside Murray Ward and Ross Elder though his main partner was Robin Millar on guitar and vocals. After a major tour of the UK, Peyronel left England and went off on a whirlwind of writing, producing and guest starring all over the world before returning to the UK. During this time he wrote the title track of Meat Loaf's \\"Midnight at the Lost and Found\\". He also guest starred on and co-produced a live album by Riff, South America's leading hard rock band, where he teamed up with guitarist Pappo and his older brother, drummer Michel Peyronel. The 1980s and 1990s Back in the UK, Peyronel wrote the words to \\"Fear\\", which was included in Sade's second, multi-platinum album, Promise. He participated on an album by Nick Mason from Pink Floyd and Rick Fenn from 10 CC ‚Äì the Mason-Fenn album Profiles; he co-wrote the only two songs with vocals and sang the lead vocal on one of them, \\"Israel\\", while David Gilmour from Pink Floyd sang \\"Lie for a Lie\\", a hit in many territories. Peyronel settled in Madrid, Spain, in 1984, where he guest-starred on an album by Banzai, a metal group led by Salvador Dom√≠nguez. Dominguez, Danny Peyronel and his brother Michel, started jamming together and out of this came Tarzen, a power-house hard rock band. They signed for ATCO Records and toured the US with Twisted Sister, and Europe and South America on their own. After two albums and nearly five years together, the group split up and Peyronel moved to Los Angeles where he dabbled at songwriting and collaborating with Desmond Child, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith and Cher. He also produced a demo for a young local band called Razzle, who later became well-known worldwide as Lit. Later years Peyronel relocated to Milan, Italy, and assembled a band to cut his debut solo album, Make the Monkey Dance, recorded and produced by Marco Barusso, and released in 2005. Musicians involved included Sinergia guitarist Luca Verde, bass player Max Zaccaro and drummer Mario Zapparoli. The album included re-workings of UFO's \\"Highway Lady\\" and Meat Loaf's \\"Midnight at the Lost and Found\\". Peyronel then put together a new line-up of the Heavy Metal Kids, singing lead vocals and writing. In 2003, they released Hit the Right Button again with the production of Marco Barusso who also joined the band . In early 2011, Peyronel undertook a tour of the US to coincide with a major re-issue of Make the Monkey Dance on Angel Air Records. X-UFO June 2011 was the launch date for X-UFO, a super-group formed entirely of UFO and UFO spin-off MSG members Laurence Archer on guitar and vocals, Danny Peyronel, Clive Edwards on drums and Rocky Newton on bass and vocals. Peyronel has taken the role of frontman/lead-singer, whilst still handling short keyboard parts. They played their debut concert as headliners at the 'Hard Rock Hell Road Trip Festival' in Ibiza, and are now embarking on several high profile appearances, such as the 'Aero Rock Starz Festival' in Bulgaria on 9 July 2011.

During her career Bampton won a treble at Arsenal and two doubles with Croydon. She also was capped a sum of 95 times for England, scoring seven goals all in all. Bampton was appointed an MBE in 1998 as a recognition of her services to women's football. She also went on to be inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005. Club career Bampton began her career at the age of 14. She played for Howbury Grange managed by her father Albert. She was a member of the side that won the Women's FA Cup in 1984. In 1987 she moved to Italy, playing for Despar Trani 80 as a full‚Äìtime professional alongside compatriot Kerry Davis. She spent just one season there, but won runners‚Äìup medals in both the Serie A and national Cup. She joined Arsenal Ladies in 1992. Bampton thereafter won with Arsenal the treble of League Cup, Premier League and FA Cup in that being her first season at the club. Her following 1993-94 season was without fruit in comparison to prior. With this being so, in 1994 Bampton left Highbury to become player-manager of Croydon Women. In 1995‚Äì96, Croydon won the League title and the FA Women's Cup. Despite leaving the field after eight minutes due to injury, Bampton won her fifth FA Cup winners' medal when Croydon beat Liverpool in the 1996 final at the New Den. She won the league with Croydon twice more before leaving to join Doncaster Belles as a player in 2000 after the Croydon club moved to Charlton. In 2004, she joined Eastbourne Borough Ladies FC, a team her father Albert was coaching. During their first season as a women's team they went on to win the Sussex County Cup and the League Cup, She joined the coaching staff of Whitehawk Ladies in the 2006 close season, along with former Arsenal and England player Angela Banks. In February 2008, she was manager of Whitehawk Ladies. Bampton joined the coaching staff of Lewes FC Ladies in January 2009. International career Bampton made her England debut whilst still at school, playing against the Netherlands in September 1978. Bampton hit the winning goal in Denmark as England qualified for the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football final. In the second leg of the final at Kenilworth Road, Bampton scored in England's penalty shootout defeat to Sweden. In 1985 she became the England captain following the retirement of Carol Thomas, then England's most capped player and still the second longest serving captain. In 1991 she was injured and replaced as captain by Gillian Coultard. In 1995 new manager Ted Copeland restored her as captain, and she led the Three Lionesses into their first ever FIFA Women's World Cup appearance that year. Bampton recalled: \\"It was difficult, especially as Gill and I were roommates and at that point the England squad was split. A lot of people wanted Clare Taylor to be captain, but it was something I'd always wanted to do and so I just enjoyed it.\\" She retained the captaincy for England's failed 1997 UEFA Women's Championship qualification campaign. In May 1997 Bampton made her final England appearance in a 6‚Äì0 friendly defeat to United States in Portland. She won 95 caps for England, scoring three goals altogether. Playing style Bampton was a tall, strong and industrious central midfielder. She characterised herself as \\"a box-to-box player\\" and said \\"I worked hard to win the ball, and I was always looking to make forward runs.

The diploma is designed for people who would like to study in higher education but who left school without attaining a Level 3 qualification, such as A-Levels. Once completed, the access diploma is held in the same standing as A-Levels, allowing holders to study for BA degrees, BSc degrees, HNCs, HNDs, LLBs and other undergraduate degrees. A national framework has been in existence since 1989. The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the Access to HE regulatory body, has been responsible for this framework in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since it was established in 1997. The first access courses were established in the 1970s. Many of these courses were set up to encourage entry to teacher training by people with a wider range of backgrounds than the traditional types of students who were attracted to teaching. Over the years, the success of these early courses led to the development of courses in other areas. In the 1987 white paper Higher Education: Meeting the Challenge, the government identified Access to HE as 'the third recognised route to higher education', and sought to extend Access to HE provision through a national framework for the recognition of Access to HE courses. Each year, around 20,000 Access to HE students apply to universities across the UK. There are over 1,000 different courses leading to the Access to HE Diploma and courses are available in most further education colleges in England and Wales. Access courses are generally tailored as pathways; that is, they prepare students with the necessary skills and imbue the appropriate knowledge required for a specific undergraduate career. For example, there are 'access to law', 'access to medicine' and 'access to nursing' pathways that prepare students to study law, medicine and nursing at undergraduate level, respectively.
