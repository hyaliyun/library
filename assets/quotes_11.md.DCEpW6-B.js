Often seen as a martyr of the Royalist cause, Favras was executed for his part in \\"planning against the people of France\\" under the Comte de Provence. He is known for his last words, \\"I see that you have made three spelling mistakes\\", upon the reading of his death sentence warrant. Career Born in Favras near Blois, he belonged to an impoverished family whose nobility dated from the 12th century. At seventeen he was a captain of dragoons, and saw some service in the closing campaign of the Seven Years' War. In 1772 he became a first lieutenant in the Swiss Guards of King Louis XVI's younger brother, the Comte de Provence. Unable to meet the expenses of his rank, which was equivalent to that of a colonel in the army, he retired in 1775. In 1776, Favras married Victoria Hedwig Karoline, Princess of Anhalt- Bernburg-Schaumburg, whose mother, after being deserted by her husband Karl Louis, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym in 1749, had found refuge with her daughter in the house of Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise. After his marriage, Favras went to Vienna to attempt the restitution of his wife's rights, and spent some time in Warsaw. In 1787 he was authorized to raise a \\"patriotic legion\\" to help the Dutch Republic against the Stadtholder William V and his Prussian allies. Returning to Paris in 1789, he became involved in Royalist plans initiated by his former employer, the Comte de Provence, to save the King and end the French Revolution. In order to finance this venture, Provence (using one of his gentlemen, the Comte de la Ch√¢tre, as an intermediary) commissioned Favras to negotiate a loan of 2,000,000 French francs from the bankers Schaumel and Sartorius. Arrest, trial, and execution It was stated in a leaflet circulated throughout Paris on 23 December 1789 that Favras had been hired by the Comte de Provence to organize an elaborate plot against the people of France. In this plot, the King, Queen and their children were to be rescued from the Tuileries Palace and spirited out of the country. Then the Comte de Provence was to be declared regent of the kingdom with absolute power. Simultaneously, a force of 30,000 soldiers was to encircle Paris. In the ensuing confusion, the city's three main liberal leaders (Jacques Necker, the popular Finance Minister of France, Jean Sylvain Bailly, the mayor of Paris, and the Marquis de La Fayette, the commander of the city's new National Guard) were to be assassinated. Afterwards, the revolutionary city was to be starved into submission by cutting off its food supplies. As a consequence of the leaflet, Favras and his wife were arrested the next day, and imprisoned in the Abbaye Prison. Terrified of the consequences of the arrest, the Comte de Provence hastened to publicly disavow Favras, in a speech delivered before the Commune of Paris, and in a letter to the National Constituent Assembly. A fortnight after the arrest, Favras and his wife were separated, and Favras was removed to the Grand Ch√¢telet. In the course of a trial that lasted nearly two months, witnesses disagreed about the facts concerning the case and evidence was lacking. Even Sylvain Mar√©chal, the anarchist editor of the republican newspaper R√©volutions de Paris, admitted that the evidence against Favras was insufficient. However, an armed attempt to free him by some Royalists on January 26, which was thwarted by La Fayette, aroused the suspicion of the Parisians, and on February 18, 1790, in spite of a notable defense plea, Favras was sentenced to be hanged. After he had previously implicated others in the conspiracy (most notably, the Comte d'Antraigues), Favras offered to give further information to the authorities on the plot's details and participants if reprieved but, denied that, refused to reveal more. His sentence was carried out in the Place de Gr√®ve the next day - a measure which was received with enthusiasm by members of the Parisian population, since it was the first instance when no distinction in the mode of execution was allowed between noble and commoner. Upon the reading of his death warrant, he remarked, \\"I see that you have made three spelling mistakes.\\" Legacy Favras was generally regarded as a martyr to the Royalist cause for his refusal to implicate the Comte de Provence, and Madame de Favras was given a pension by Louis XVI. She left France, and her son Charles de Favras served in the Habsburg and the Imperial Russian armies. Under the Bourbon Restoration, Charles received an allowance from Louis XVIII. Her daughter Caroline married Rudiger, Freiherr von Stillfried und Rathenitz in 1805. The official dossier of Favras' trial for high treason against the nation disappeared from the Ch√¢telet, but its substance is preserved in the papers of a clerk.

The park encompasses an area of approximately in the Bale Mountains and Sanetti Plateau of the Ethiopian Highlands. The park's Afromontane habitats have one of the highest incidences of animal endemicity of any terrestrial habitat in the world. The park was nominated to the World Heritage Tentative List in 2009. Geography Bale Mountains National Park is located in southeastern Ethiopia, 400 km southeast of Addis Ababa and 150 km east of Shashamene in the Oromia Region National State. The boundary of the BMNP lies within five woredas (districts): Adaba (west), Dinsho (north), Goba (northeast), Delo- Mena-Angetu and Harena-Buluk (southeast). The park area is encompassed within geographical coordinates of 6¬∫29' ‚Äì 7¬∫10'N and 39¬∫28' ‚Äì 39¬∫57'E. The Bale Mountains are part of the Bale-Arsi massif, which forms the western section of the southeastern Ethiopian Highlands. Bale Mountains and park landscape.  Geology and glaciation  The Bale Mountains were formed prior to the formation of the Great Rift Valley, from lava outpourings which covered all underlying rock formations between 38 and 7 million years ago. The rocks of the volcanic outpourings are predominantly trachytes, but also include rhyolites, basalts, and associated agglomerates and tuffs. The main Bale highlands consist of the vast lava Sanetti Plateau, with at least six volcanic cones, each more than 4,200 meters high and considerably flattened by repeated glaciations. There have been at least two glacial periods in the history of the mountains and they were glaciated as little as 2,000 years ago. During the Last ice age, the Bale Mountains were one of the most extensively glaciated areas in present-day Ethiopia, with a total area of ice in Bale of approximately 180 km2. There was a 30 km2 ice cap around the peak of Tulu Dimtu (the second highest mountain in Ethiopia) on the Sanetti Plateau and individual glaciers of considerable thickness reached down to 3,200 meters. As a consequence, the landscape as we see it today is the lava outpourings much modified by over 20 million years of erosion by water, wind and ice. There are certain geological features that remain an enigma to geologists and glaciologists such as the striations that appear on shallow hillsides on the Sanetti Plateau. Boulder grooves (large stone sorted stripes two to four meters wide and eighty meters long), till ridges and numerous glacial valleys, such as the Togona Valley on the northeast facing slopes of the Sanetti Plateau, provide evidence of the ice-age effects on the landscape of BMNP. Until the beginning of deglaciation (13,000 to 14,000 years ago) the snowline was at 3,700 meters and the upper tree limit in the Bale Mountains was well below 3,000 meters. Fluctuations in climate over the last historical period, including the last 3,000 years, have dramatically affected the vegetation and other biodiversity in the highlands. Stream in the park.  Hydrology  The Bale Mountains play a vital role in climate control of the region by attracting large amounts of orographic rainfall, which has obvious implications for livestock and agricultural production. Some 600 - 1,000 mm fall annually in the lower altitude areas, while 1,000 - 1,400 mm fall in areas of higher altitude, and over 12 million people from Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia are dependent on water from the Bale massif. A total of 40 rivers rise in the BMNP area, contributing to five major rivers: the Web, Wabe Shebele, Welmel, Dumal and Ganale. Additionally, the Bale massif is the source for many springs in the lowlands, which are of paramount importance as they are the only source of water year-round. People living south of the national park are completely dependent on good management of the water resources from the highland areas. If the flow of these rivers is altered in any way ‚Äì through deforestation, overgrazing of pastures and/or over abstraction for irrigation (all of which are occurring at present) ‚Äì a highland/lowland imbalance results with loss of perennial water in the lowlands. If such a situation arises, the dry season range of the people and their livestock reduces dramatically and they concentrate about whatever water source remains. It is widely recognized that such uneven distribution of people and livestock leads to rapid and lasting degradation. The people are, therefore, likely to become increasingly food-aid dependent if the water catchment areas of the Bale Mountains are insufficiently protected. There is already evidence that over abstraction of water in the Bale Mountains is occurring. Furthermore, two rivers emanating from Bale, the Wabe Shebele and Yadot, (tributary of the Ganale) have hydroelectric schemes. The dam on the Yadot River supplies electricity to Delo-Mena, while the dam on the Wabe Shebele provides electricity to the Bale area. Lastly, there are numerous natural mineral water springs, locally called horas, which provide an essential source of minerals for livestock. The mineral springs within the park are valued for their high mineral content (sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc and calcium), and local pastoralists believe that in order to maintain good health and milk production their livestock must be given hora water. They will drive their livestock for up to two days to reach the hora springs. It is increasingly apparent, however, that the hora springs have become an excuse for local people to enter the park to gain access to better grazing areas. Harenna Forest landscape in the park.  Climate  Temperatures vary widely throughout BMNP: on the plateau, daytime temperatures are usually around 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) with strong winds; in the Gaysay Valley average daytime temperatures are around 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F), and the Harenna Forest is around 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F). However, weather changes frequently and sometimes drastically. In elevations over 3,000 meters, night frosts are common. The rainy season is from May until November. Harenna Forest woodland in the park. Ecology = Habitats = The park is divided into five distinct and unique habitats: the Northern Grasslands (Gaysay Valley), Northern Woodlands (Park Headquarters), Afro-alpine Meadows (Sanetti Pleateau), Erica Moorlands, and the Harenna Forest. Habitats of the Bale Mountains National Park range from grassland areas around in elevation, to Mount Tullu Demtu, the second highest point in Ethiopia at above sea level. Surrounded by East African pencil juniper (Juniperus procera) trees and St. John‚Äôs wort, waist-high wildflowers and grasses grow in the Northern Grasslands and Woodlands. Tree heath (Erica arborea) is native to the Ethiopian montane moorlands ecoregion in the park. The Afro-alpine moorlands of the Sanetti Plateau is the largest continuous area of its altitude on the entire continent of Africa. Carpeted in lichen covered rocks, and punctuated by Giant lobelia (Lobelia rynchopatelum) that grow to heights of up to 12 meters. The Plateau is also dotted with alpine lakes and streams, providing important resident wildlife resources, as well as wintering and passage stations for rare and regionally endemic birds. The Harenna Forest plant community makes up about half of the park, a woodland of trees draped in moss and lichens that seem to drip off the branches. The area is frequently cloaked in fog, and wildlife is elusive. = Fauna = Ethiopian wolf Mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni). The Bale Mountains National Park is an important area for several threatened Ethiopian endemic species. Additionally, the park holds 26% of Ethiopia‚Äôs endemic species including one primate, one bovid, one hare, eight rodent species, and the entire global population of the big-headed African mole-rat. There are also several rare and endemic amphibians. Mammals Mammal species in the Bale Mountains National Park include Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), Mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), big- headed African mole-rat, bushbuck, common duiker, klipspringer, Bohor reedbuck, warthog, spotted hyaena, serval.Stephens, P.A., d'Sa, C.A., Sillero- Zubiri, C. and Leader-Williams, N.

Oryx 44(4): 558‚àí563 Other mammals of Bale Mountains National Park include the Cape bushbuck, African golden wolf, spotted hyena, colobus monkey, lion, African leopard, and African wild dog. Almost one third of the 47 mammals that live in BMNP are rodents. The rodent community, particularly of the Afro-alpine plateau are keystone species in the Bale Mountains National Park. They are the main prey for Ethiopian wolf, and natural grazers of the Afro-alpine areas where important cryoturbation processes happen. The Afro-alpine area is home to over half of the global population of the Ethiopian wolf, the rarest canid in the world with only 400 animals surviving. The northern juniper-hagenia woodlands harbor the largest population of the endemic and similarly endangered Mountain nyala, estimated to be approximately two-thirds of the global population. The Ethiopian wolf is restricted to just six isolated mountainous areas of the Ethiopian Highlands and is protected in the country from any activities that may threaten its survival. Habitat loss, caused by unsustainable and rapidly expanding cattle and crop farming is the most severe threat, but diseases like rabies and canine distemper transmitted from domestic dogs are a serious immediate threat and have recently caused population crashes in the Bale Mountains. = Flora = Bale Mountains National Park is home to 1,321 species of flowering plants, 163 of which are endemic to Ethiopia (12%), and 23 to Bale alone (14% of Ethiopia‚Äôs endemic plants). The forests of the Bale Mountains are important for genetic stocks of wild forest coffee (Coffea arabica) and for medicinal plants in Ethiopia. Three medicinal plant hotspots have been identified: two in the Gaysay area and one in the Angesu area, spanning the park boundary. The female flowers of hagenia contain anthelmintic, which is used to treat tapeworms among the local populations.https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-6-20 St. John‚Äôs wort is used to combat depression. A 2006 study estimated the value of the medicinal plants industry to be approximately two billion Ethiopian birr annually, some 8% of Ethiopia‚Äôs Federal budget at the time. = Avifauna = Rated by the African Bird Club as the number four birding site in Africa, the Bale Mountains are home to over 282 species of birds, including nine of the 16 species endemic to Ethiopia. Furthermore, over 170 migratory birds have been recorded within the park. Bale Mountains National Park is home to almost every highland Abyssinian and Ethiopian endemic. With over 863 species of birds recorded, representing approximately 9.5% of the world‚Äôs bird diversity and 39% of the bird species in Africa, Ethiopia is often considered one of the most avifaunal-rich countries in Africa. Sixteen of Bale‚Äôs bird species are endemic to Ethiopia. Due to the diversity and density of rodents, the Bale Mountains are also an extremely important area for resident as well as wintering and passing raptors. Ethiopian endemic birds found in the Bale Mountains include: blue-winged goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera), spot-breasted lapwing (Vanellus melanocephalus), yellow-fronted parrot (Poicephalus flavifrons), Abyssinian longclaw (Macronyx flavicollis), Abyssinian catbird (Parophasma galinieri), Bale parisoma (Parisoma griseiventris), Ethiopian siskin (Serinus nigriceps), fawn-breasted waxbill (Estrilda paludicola) and the Abyssinian owl (Asio abyssinicus).  People of Bale  The people of the region are dominantly Oromo-speaking farmers and cattle herders. The population of the entire Bale Zone is approximately 1.5 million. Afan Oromo is the official language of Oromia. It belongs to the Cushitic languages, and serves as a sort of lingua franca for over 25 million Oromos. However, most people in Bale Mountains speak some Amharic. The predominant religion in the Bale Mountains is Muslim (77%), followed by Orthodox Christian (20%) and Protestant (1%). The Bale Mountains are the true ancestral home of the Oromo, the largest single ethnic group in the Horn of Africa. Living as pastoralists and farmers, the population grew quite quickly and expanded to different corners of the country beginning in the 16th century. Little is known about the Oromo people of the area and how they came to be there. They are part of the eastern Cushitic people stemming from a branch of the Caucasoid race (which includes Western Asians, Arabs and Europeans), and are distributed from Wello in Ethiopia‚Äôs north, to Mombasa in Kenya to the south. Some 3,000 years ago, they passed on practices such as the initiation ceremony of circumcision and habit of not eating fish to Nilotic peoples in the West. Furthermore, they incorporated the ideas of the Gadaa system and cattle husbandry into their own society. The Gadaa system is based on the principles of classifying a society into 11 functional grades, each of which has its special roles and statuses. Currently people subsist mainly on agriculture. They follow a traditional transhumance system known as the Godantu system, a key feature of traditional human use of the Bale Mountains. In this system, livestock, particularly cattle, are sent to higher grazing grounds during the months when crops are growing in lower altitudes or into the forest for shade during the dry season. However this should not be confused with the cattle movements that are a consequence of the loss of grazing land outside of the park, thus forcing cattle into the park to graze. Bale houses are circular in shape and locally referred to as ‚Äúmana citaa‚Äù. Juniper and sometimes eucalyptus are used to make the walls and roof. The roof is covered with thatched grass cut from ‚Äúcitaa‚Äù (tussock grass) or stubble, especially barley, and supported by a wooden pillar, which stands in the middle of the floor. The house is divided into portions by walls made of bamboo or mud mixed with stubble of barley or grass.  History  In contrast to other parts of Ethiopia, very little was written about the Bale Mountains prior to the 1950s, despite the facts that Goba (a main town within the mountains) was connected to Addis Ababa by a telegraph line in 1931, was served with Ethiopian Airlines DC-3 aircraft prior to the 1950s, and that the brief period of Italian government (1935-1941) reached the region with stations in Goba, Dinsho and Delo-Mena. As records begin to appear at the beginning of the 20th century, the Bale Mountains were largely uninhabited. The first recorded visit was by the German naturalist and explorer Carlo Von Erlanger who reached the Bale Mountains between 1899 and 1901. During his time in the region, he documented the existence of the giant molerat. Thereafter, a Frenchman, the Vicomte du Bourg, spent two months in Goba in 1901 hunting elephant to the south and traveling around the mountains. He recorded the existence of elephant and buffalo in the Harenna Forest, and commented on the ivory hunting of the area - primarily by mounted horsemen using guns. Following these early records, there is no information until the late 1950s, when Finnish geographer, Helmer Smels, arrived in Bale. He made three journeys to Bale and crossed the area from Goba, through Rira to Delo- Mena. By the time of his visits, just 50 years after Vicomte du Bourg had noted the presence of elephants, they had disappeared from the Harenna Forest. Smels noted that although the Sanetti Plateau was uninhabited, people drove their cattle to the plateau for grazing during the dry season, sometimes for up to three months. Additionally, the mountains were used for their mineral springs or horas, to which the pastoral people also drove their cattle. People stayed overnight in simple, temporary shelters made of split bamboo. The Harenna Forest was uninhabited but for small groups of temporary huts in some of the clearings where people grazed their cattle for part of the year. Although not dwelling there permanently, honey gatherers have always been active in the Harenna Forest. During the same period, a British botanist, Herbert Mooney, visited the Harenna Forest and Sanetti Plateau. He noted the growing settlement of Rira within the Harenna Forest and other hamlets of honey gatherers and pastoral people. Although the Harenna Forest was probably quite populated towards the end of the 19th century, the area was depopulated again as a result of a rinderpest epidemic that killed most of the cattle in the early 1890s. The impetus for the present national park began with two visits to the area in 1963 and 1965 by the British naturalist, Dr. Leslie Brown who was in the area explicitly to assess the status of mountain Nyala. The major recommendation of his visits was that a national park should be established in the Bale Mountains to protect their habitat. John Blower, advisor to the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organization (now Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA)) and a Peace Corps volunteer, followed through with Dr. Brown‚Äôs recommendation by surveying the area and proposed boundaries of the park. In 1969 the Bale Mountains National Park was established.  Threats  Bale Mountains National Park is faced with many threats associated with an ever-developing and an increasingly populated Ethiopia. One of the biggest threats to the park is grazing. For example, within the Web Valley, a prime Ethiopian wolf habitat, cattle density is estimated at 250 per square kilometer. Other threats include increasing settlements within the park. Currently over 40,000 people live within the park‚Äôs boundaries, increasing pressure on the natural resources of the area and diminishing natural habitats of wild animals. With these settlements come domestic dogs, which pose a great threat to the Ethiopian wolf. Dogs transmit rabies and canine distemper, and in 2010 killed 106 individuals (approximately 40% of the Bale population). Other serious threats include the use of the wolf habitat by livestock for grazing which significantly reduces the availability of rodent prey. Over 12 million people, their livestock and the environment in the south of Ethiopia as well as neighboring Somalia and northern Kenya rely on the water that originates from the Bale massif. Unsustainable use and pollution are major threats. Conservationists suggest that if conservation efforts in the Bale Mountains are not successful and people continue to exploit the resources in an unsustainable way, more species of mammal would go extinct than any other area of equivalent size on the planet.  Activities  The Bale Mountains National Park is open year-round although the most popular time to visit is November through April when the rains have stopped. The park can be reached by private car or public transportation from Addis Ababa. Visitors may choose to trek throughout the park either by horseback or on foot, or alternatively to visit the park entirely by car. Treks range from one to 12 nights and travel through all the different ecosystems of the park.

The album was co-produced by Gerard Johnson and had arrangements by To Rococo Rot and Sean O'Hagan. It was recorded at To Rococo Rot's studio, Amber Sound, in Berlin, Germany. The band have described the recording sessions as 'working in an airless, windowless oven'. The album and singles artwork were all designed by Julian Opie an artist famed for his portraits of the band Blur. \\"The Place at Dawn\\" contains a sample of Magna Carta's \\"Medley\\", from the 1970 album Seasons. Reissue Sound Of Water was remastered and reissued as part of Heavenly Recordings/Universal's deluxe editions of the band's recordings on . The same deluxe edition was released in the United States on 30 June 2017 by PIAS Recordings. The new release features b-sides, unreleased tracks and the entire Places to Visit EP, which was previously only released in the United States and Germany. Track listing ;Notes Due to a mastering error on the 2009 deluxe edition of the album, the song \\"Blofeld Buildings\\" is longer than the original version featured on the fan-club compilation Built On Sand. The same song starts playing again at the 1:32 mark, which makes the whole track end at 6:11. The 2017 reissue of the release corrected this flaw.

History and organization Compassion & Choices is the successor to the Hemlock Society, and Compassion In Dying Federation; the organizations merged in 2007. The organization has a staff of 80 people located across the country. =Compassion & Choices of Oregon= was a US nonprofit organization launched in 1998 as a provider of services for persons eligible for the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, and their physicians and pharmacists. The organization recruited and trained volunteers to provide legal and medical consultation and direct service at no cost. It was a state affiliate of Compassion & Choices, and provides education, information and support to approximately 1000 Oregonians each year. The state affiliate ceased operations in 2015. The 2011 Sundance Film Festival winner, How to Die in Oregon, documented the work of Compassion & Choices of Oregon. In early Spring 2012 the organization's medical director emeritus, Peter Goodwin, M.D., announced he was dying of a neurological disorder and would end his life with medication and protection of Oregon's Death with Dignity law. Goodwin died at home, surrounded by friends, on March 11. End-of-life consultation program Compassion & Choices provides end-of-life consultation for dying patients and their families at no cost. Professional consultants and trained volunteers work by phone or in person to offer assistance in completing advance directives, make referrals to local services including hospice and illness-specific support groups, advice on adequate pain and symptom management, and information on safe, effective and legal methods for aid in dying. The organization's work is highlighted in the documentary film How to Die in Oregon which won the 2011 Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.

It is a parasitic organism whose adult form infects the intestine of carnivores, like canids. It is related to Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, and to Taenia saginata, the beef tapeworm. It is commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere, especially throughout Canada and the northern United States. Natural intermediate hosts of this organism are usually small rodents and moles. The larval stages of T. crassiceps develop subcutaneously or in their body cavities as cysticerci which are cyst-like structures. T. crassiceps begins its life in the intestines of wild canines, like a wolf. Inside the wolf, the tapeworm reproduces. Its eggs are passed in the wolf feces, and are eaten by a rat. When the rat is eaten by another wolf, the parasite's life cycle repeats. Taenia crassiceps rarely infect humans; however if they do, they often cause ocular larva migrans that can progress to blindness. An adult human's immune system typically removes the parasite before permanent damage is done. However juveniles are typically less defended.  Human Pathologies  Taenia crassiceps is described as an opportunistic infection in severe immunodeficiency, as in AIDS. But human infection are rare, with only eight cases reported and individuals who were infected tended to be immunosuppressed patients where parasites accumulated on skeletal muscles and subcutaneous tissue, and some with intraocular infections. Rodents are natural intermediate hosts, and they harbor the cyst-like larvae (metacestodes, cysticerci) in the peritoneal cavity, where they multiply by asexual budding. Humans serve as intermediate hosts when food or water contaminated with feces from infected canids or felids is consumed. Cranial MRI of the German woman as described. A- Transverse view, T1-weighted MR image. The 30 √ó 30 mm parasitic lesion with perifocal edema is located in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum and caused ataxia, headache, and nausea. The fourth ventricle is compressed. B- Coronal view, T2-weighted MR image. The cyst-like appearance of the parasitic tissue is clearly visible. This lesion can be misinterpreted as cerebral echinococcosis, racemose cysticercosis caused by a Taenia solium tapeworm, or coenurosis. C- Sagittal view, MR image with contrast enhancing agent. D- Transverse view, computed tomographic image after surgery. A case of intracranial T. crassiceps tapeworm cysticercosis with severe involvement of the cerebellum is described. A 51-year-old German woman was hospitalized because of progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting. The signs and symptoms had started 2 weeks before, and intensity had been increasing ever since. At the time of admission, the patient showed cerebellar ataxia but no further neurologic deficits. She did not have fever or other symptoms. She had no known chronic preconditions or recent hospital stays and had never taken immunosuppressant drugs. She had no family history of neurologic symptoms or malignant diseases. Combined surgical removal of the larvae and treatment with albendazole and praziquantel led to a complete cure in this nonimmunocompromised patient. The organism was unequivocally identified by molecular methods, thus avoiding a misdiagnosis of Taenia solium tapeworm cysticercosis.Ntoukas V, Tappe D, Pf√ºtze D, Simon M, Holzmann T. Cerebellar cysticercosis caused by larval Taenia crassiceps tapeworm in immunocompetent woman, Germany. Emerg Infect Dis [Internet]. 2013 Dec [December 16, 2013].  Symptoms  There may be no symptoms. Symptoms may include: Headaches, Nausea, and VomitingNtoukas V, Tappe D, Pf√ºtze D, Simon M, Holzmann T. Cerebellar cysticercosis caused by larval Taenia crassiceps tapeworm in immunocompetent woman, Germany. Emerg Infect Dis [Internet]. 2013 Dec [December 16, 2013].  Laboratory Studies  Positive test results from a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA for anticysticercal antibodies help confirm the diagnosis; however, negative test results do not exclude cysticercosis. A CBC count may reveal eosinophilia.  Treatments  Surgical removal is mandatory for individuals with intraoscular cysts. Oscular cysticercosis can be effectively treated with Anthelminthics such as Albendazole or Praziquantel, oral corticosteroids.  Immunoregulation  The immune response elicited by T. crassiceps and its antigens in human and mice cells were studied, suggesting that it had a strong capacity to induce chronic Th2-type responses that are primarily characterized by high levels of Th2 cytokines, low proliferative response in lymphocytic cells, immature and LPS-tolerogenic profile in dendritic cells, the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and activated macrophages.

The NTRA has offices in Lexington, Kentucky, and Rye Brook, New York. Historically, it is the marketing departments of the individual tracks, not the national marketing campaigns, which have attracted a fan base. In 2012, the radio campaign by advertising agency, DeVito/Verdi, led to an increase in a younger, more affluent fan base, and won the Mercury awards for the best radio campaign.http://devitoverdi.vzaar.me/1210369 History =Founding and early lobbying= The NTRA was formed in 1998 with startup funding provided by Breeders' Cup Limited, Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, The Jockey Club, Keeneland Association, Oak Tree Racing Association and the National Thoroughbred Association. It replaced the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America as the sponsor of the American Horse of the Year awards in 1998. Beginning in the late 1990s, the NTRA operated a number of lobbying campaigns in Washington, D.C. They NTRA registered a \\"hard money\\" political action committee with the Federal Election Commission on July 14, 2000, with the organization quoting that \\"a $1-million PAC is a necessary complement to the NTRA's federal lobbying efforts.\\" =Online wagering - Federal authorization= On December 15, 2000, the United States Congress passed a package of appropriations bills which included an amendment to the Interstate Horseracing Act (IHA), a bill first enacted in 1978. The NTRA had been a key lobbying team behind the new legislation, and the IHA Amendment was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 22 and clarified that the US horse racing industry could conduct interstate simulcasting and \\"commingling of pools and account wagering,\\" so long as the states where the activity occurred permitted such activity. This legislation confirmed that Internet- based wagering related to horse racing was legal, so long as the wagering business could confirm the identity and age via closed-loop authentication. Separate gambling legislation known as the Federal Wire Act that historically prohibited any betting over state lines via technology stayed intact, with horse racing becoming the sole exemption for federally recognized online gambling in states that authorized the activity. =Federal tax relief= Beginning in 2002 the NTRA lobbying team advocated for H.R. 4474, which gained bipartisan support for its proposal to eliminate the 30% tax that the U.S. government then placed on all international bets. This legislation was signed into law in by President George W. Bush October 22, 2004. In 2006 the NTRA lobbying team secured an additional exemption for horse racing in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, signed by President Bush on October 13, 2006.

NEL‚Äôs charter was ‚Äúto effectuate the solution of any problem in the field of electronics, in connection with the design, procurement, testing, installation and maintenance of electronic equipment for the U.S. Navy.‚Äù Its radio communications and sonar work was augmented with basic research in the propagation of electromagnetic energy in the atmosphere and of sound in the ocean. History In November 1945, the Navy Radio and Sound Lab was renamed as Navy Electronics Laboratory. 80% of the Point Loma Military Reservation evolved into the Naval Electronics Laboratory Center (NELC) at the end of World War II. In turn NELC was merged into the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) in 1977. This eventually was merged into the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in 1997. In the 1960s, NELC was tasked with 4C: Command, Control, Communications and Computers.  Projects  = Shipboard Antenna Model Range = Shipboard Antenna Model Range photograph showing location of model ship. As one of its first projects, NEL began building its Shipboard Antenna Model Range. The non- metallic arch of this structure supports a transmitting antenna which is positioned toward a brass model ship on a turntable. The ground plane under the arch simulates the electrical characteristics of the ocean, allowing research on the properties of shipboard antennas to be carried out. = Arctic submarine exploration = Battery Whistler facility, c. 1948. It also began conversion of a World War II mortar emplacement, Battery Whistler, into an Arctic Submarine Laboratory. Scientific exploration of the Arctic Basin, and particularly providing the capability to operate attack submarines in the Arctic under the ice canopy, would become a key NEL mission. USS Baya and research vessel USS Rexburg were part of a small but active fleet of ships used by NEL. World headlines came early in this program from several events‚Äîthe submerged voyage of USS Nautilus from the Pacific to the Atlantic, via the North Pole, in 1958, with NEL‚Äôs Dr. Waldo Lyon aboard as chief scientist and ice pilot. That same summer, the USS Skate cruised from the Atlantic to the North Pole and the central Arctic Ocean, surfacing 9 times through small holes in the ice cap. Dr. Eugene C. La Fond, head of NEL's Oceanography Branch, was chief scientist In March 1959, the Skate returned to the Arctic, under winter conditions, with Dr. Waldo Lyon as chief scientist, and for the first time, the nuclear submarine was able to surface exactly at the North Pole. = Bathyscaphe Trieste = The Bathyscaphe Trieste. NEL also plunged into the undersea environment, acquiring the Bathyscaphe Trieste and directing its 1960 dive over 35,000 feet (10.7 km) down into the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench near Guam. = Radio telescopes = La Posta Astro- Geophysical Observatory Interested in radio physics in general, the lab built a -diameter radio telescope on Point Loma, and in 1964, NEL began construction of the La Posta Astro-Geophysical Observatory on a site in the Laguna Mountains, east of San Diego. The observatory played a major role in solar radio mapping, studies of environmental disturbances, and development of a solar optical videometer for microwave research. Its dish, which could both transmit and receive, was used for important Center research programs in propagation and ionospheric forecasting which was used during a number of Apollo space launches to predict solar activity that might hamper communications from the ground to the space capsules. = Communications = In the area of communications, NEL developed Verdin, a low-frequency/very-low- frequency (LF/VLF) system to provide information to deeply submerged Polaris missile submarines, and began development of satellite communication capabilities. Requirements for handling the vast amount of shipboard communications during the intensifying Vietnam War led to tasking for an internal message handling system. In response, the lab developed the Message Processing and Distribution System (MPDS), installing it aboard the Seventh Fleet flagship USS Oklahoma City a month ahead of schedule. The lab improved substantially on that system later and installed it aboard Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. = Computer science = The programming language dialect NELIAC was developed by and named after the lab. NELIAC was the brainchild of Harry Huskey, at the time Chairman of the Association for Computing Machinery, who had suggested porting applications in a machine-independent form. ALGOL 58 gave NEL the framework for an implementation, and work commenced in 1958, but was not fully developed until 1961. NELIAC was used at NEL to support experimental anti-submarine systems and Command and Control Systems development, and later, at the Navy Command Systems and Support Activity (NAVCOSSACT) in Washington DC in support of the National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA) project which was installed on many large ships starting in 1966. This was the world's first self-compiling compiler and was ported to many other computers in the Department of Defense, it also included the NELOS operating system development used for large scale applications (unique to the AN/USQ-20 Navy shipboard computer and its commercial version, the UNIVAC 490). Many other versions existed for a variety of computers because the ease of portability and the rapid one-pass compile times.  Naval Command, Control and Communications Laboratory Center and beyond  In 1967, as part of the general Navy laboratory re-organization, NEL became the Naval Command, Control and Communications Laboratory Center. The name was never fully accepted, and in about six months it was changed to Naval Electronics Laboratory Center (NELC). In 1971, the Antisubmarine Forces Command and Control System (AFCCS) and Naval Ocean Surveillance System (NOSS) were software projects under development at NELC using an IBM 360/65 computer. AFCCS (later ASWCCCS) was re-written in 1972 for the Honeywell 6050 computer after DoD contracted with Honeywell to supply computers for the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS). On March 1, 1977, NELC and NUC were consolidated to form the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) (today the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific).\\"SSC Pacific Celebrating 70th Anniversary in 2010,\\" SSC Pacific Daily News Bulletin, Sept. 4, 2014.

Leggett William C. Leggett (born 1939) is a Canadian biologist who served as the 17th Principal of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario from 1994 to 2004. He was only the second scientist to hold the Principalship. Leggett's term as Principal was notable for his strong leadership and his insistence on measuring Queen's against the highest national and international standards. Dr. Leggett is currently Principal Emeritus and Professor Emeritus of Biology at Queen's. He is the author/co-author of over 170 peer reviewed scientific publications in the fields of Fish Ecology and Fisheries Oceanography. Biography Leggett was born in 1939 in Orangeville, Ontario, He received his high school education at Orangeville District High School and a B.A. from Waterloo University College (now Wilfrid Laurier University) in 1962. He then studied Zoology at the University of Waterloo, from which he obtained his M.Sc. in 1965, and McGill University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1969. Following several years as a research scientist at the Essex Marine Laboratory in Essex, Connecticut Leggett had a long and successful career at McGill: he was appointed an Assistant Professor in 1970, Associate Professor in 1974, full Professor in 1979, Chair of Biology in 1981, Dean of Science in 1986 and Vice-Principal Academic in 1991. He left McGill to become Principal of Queen's University in 1994. Leggett's tenure at Queen's saw the largest capital renewal program in the University's 160-year history, including the construction of Chernoff Hall, Goodes Hall, Beamish-Munro Hall, Leggett Hall and Watts Hall, the expansion of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre and the renovation/restoration of Gordon Hall. During his tenure Queen's moved to a clear leadership position in Canada in the participation of students in international study programs, completed the largest fund-raising campaign in its history, more than doubled its research funding, and strengthened its leadership position in Canadian post-secondary education. Leggett's work, both in biological science and as a leader in Canadian education, has resulted in numerous national and international awards, including membership in the Order of Canada, Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada, Paul Harris Fellow of Rotary International, honorary degrees from McGill, Queen's, McMaster, Laval, Wilfrid Laurier and Waterloo Universities, the Fry Medal of the Canadian Society of Zoologists and, from the American Fisheries Society, the Award of Excellence in Fisheries Education for his exceptional contributions to undergraduate and graduate level education in his discipline, and the Oscar E. Sette Award and the Award of Excellence for outstanding research contributions to fisheries and marine ecology. His research publications have been identified by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) as being among the most highly cited in his field worldwide.

They are a World Heritage Site and include the Simien Mountains National Park. The mountains consist of plateaus separated by valleys and rising to pinnacles. The tallest peak is Ras Dejen (4,550 m); other notable heights include Mounts Biuat (4,437 m) and Kidis Yared (4,453 m). Because of their geological origins, the mountains are almost unique, with only South Africa's Drakensberg having been formed in the same manner and thus appearing similar. Notable animals in the mountains include the walia ibex, gelada, and caracal. There are a few Ethiopian wolves.  Geology and landscape  The Semien Mountains were formed prior to the creation of the Rift Valley, from lava outpourings between 40 and 25 million years ago during the Oligocene period. The volcano is believed to have spread over more than 5000 m2 and resulted in a thick sequence of basaltic lava some 3,000-3,500 m thick that was deposited on Precambrian crystalline basement. The major part of the Semien Mountains consists of remnants of a Hawaiian-type shield volcano. The Kidus Yared peak is situated near the center of the shield volcano. Ras Dejen (4,533 m), Bwahit (4,430 m) and Silki (4,420 m) were formed from the outer core of this ancient volcano. The extreme escarpment in Semien appears to be a precondition for the formation of the extended uplift of the whole mountain massif 75 million years ago. The dramatic views are due to this volcanic activity. Especially of note is the 2,000 m high escarpment extending in a southwest-northeast direction. There are different types of soils as a result of the difference in geological formation, glaciations, topography, and climate. The Humic Andosol is the dominant soil type which is mainly found at an altitude of 3,000 m. The other types of soil are shallow Andosols, Lithosols, and Haplic Phaeozems that are mainly common in the area between 2,500 and 3,500 m. The Semien Mountains are highly eroded as a result of human land use practices and as a result of the topography of the area.  Human history  Although the word Semien means \\"north\\" in Amharic, according to Richard Pankhurst the ancestral form of the word actually meant \\"south\\" in Ge'ez, because the mountains lay to the south of Aksum, which was at the time the center of Ethiopian civilization. But as over the following centuries the center of Ethiopian civilization itself moved to the south, these mountains came to be thought of as lying to the north, and the meaning of the word likewise changed.\\"Historical Notes on Books: An Early Ethiopian Map\\" (Capital newspaper website) The Semiens are remarkable as being one of the few spots in Africa where snow regularly falls. Discussed further in Frederick J. Simoons, \\"Snow in Ethiopia: A Review of the Evidence\\", Geographical Review, 50 (1960), pp. 402-411. First mentioned in the Monumentum Adulitanum of the 4th century AD (which described them as \\"inaccessible mountains covered with snow\\" and where soldiers walked up to their knees in snow), the presence of snow was undeniably witnessed by the 17th century Jesuit priest Jer√≥nimo Lobo.Donald M. Lockhart (translator), The Itiner√°rio of Jer√≥nimo Lobo (London: Hakluyt Society, 1984), p. 240. Although the later traveler James Bruce claims that he had never witnessed snow in the Semien Mountains, the 19th century explorer Henry Salt not only recorded that he saw snow there (on 9 April 1814), but explained the reason for Bruce's failure to see snow in these mountains ‚Äì Bruce had ventured no further than the foothills into the Semiens.Henry Salt, A Voyage to Abyssinia and Travels into the Interior of that Country, 1814 (London: Frank Cass, 1967), p. 352. Despite their ruggedness and altitude, the mountains are dotted with villages linked by tracks. Historically they were inhabited by Ethiopian Jews (the Beta Israel), who after repeated attacks by the zealous Christian Emperors in the 15th century withdrew from the province of Dembiya into the more defensible Semien mountains.One account of this process is James Quirin, \\"Caste and Class in Historical North-West Ethiopia: The Beta Israel (Falasha) and Kemant, 1300-1900\\", Journal of African History, 39 (1998), pp. 195-220 Towards the end of the Zemene Mesafint, Dejazmach Wube Haile Mariam maintained his arsenal and treasury on Mount Hai.Henry A.

He was awarded the title Grandmaster by FIDE in 1977. Life and career Born in Tbilisi, Georgian SSR into a family of Georgian Jews, his older brother is Nodar Djin. Dzindzichashvili won the Junior Championship of the Soviet Union in 1962 and the University Championships in 1966 and 1968. In 1970, he was awarded the title of International Master by FIDE. He left the U.S.S.R. in 1976 for Israel and earned the Grandmaster title in 1977. In 1979, he settled in the United States, and he won the Lone Pine tournament the next year. He led the U.S.team at the Chess Olympiad in 1984. One of his best career performances was first place at the 53rd Hastings Chess Festival in 1977/1978. He scored 10¬Ω out of 14 points, a full point ahead of former World Champion Tigran Petrosian. He won the U.S. Chess Championship twice, in 1983 and again in 1989, sharing the title with two other players each time. He briefly took up residence in Washington Square Park in New York City, and hustled chess during the 1980s, making a living playing blitz for stakes, as is popular there. He had a cameo in the 1993 film Searching for Bobby Fischer. He also had a brief appearance in \\"Men Who Would Be Kings\\", a documentary about chess in Washington Square Park set in the 1980s. Dzindzichashvili is a well-known theoretician and a chess coach. Among his students are 5-time US Champion Gata Kamsky and Eugene Perelshteyn.

People on home hemodialysis are followed by a nephrologist who writes the dialysis prescription and they rely on the support of a dialysis unit for back-up treatments and case management. Studies show that HHD improves patients' sense of well-being; the more they know about and control their own treatment the better they are likely to do on dialysis.National Kidney Foundation: A to Z Health Guide Schedules There are three basic schedules of HHD and these are differentiated by the length and frequency of dialysis and the time of day the dialysis is carried out. They are as follows: * Conventional HHD - done three times a week for three to five hours. It is like in-centre hemodialysis (IHD), but done at home. Some patients utilize a modified conventional \\"EOD\\" (Every Other Day) strategy in which treatments are performed an average of 3.5 times a week. It is generally accepted that the \\"3 day gap\\" that occurs once a week in conventional HHD on the normal 3x/week schedule increases risk to the patient. * Short daily home hemodialysis (SDHHD) - done five to seven times a week for two to four hours per session. * Nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHHD) - done three to seven times per week at night during sleep, for six to ten hours. Thus an NHHD schedule results in a larger dose of hemodialysis per week, as do some SDHHD. More total time dialyzing, shorter periods between treatments and the fact that fluid removal speeds can be lower (thus reducing the symptoms resulting from rapid ultrafiltration), accounts for the advantages of these schedules over conventional ones. A frequent NHHD schedule has been shown to have better clinical outcomes than a conventional schedule and evidence is mounting that clinical outcomes are improved with each increase in treatment frequency. =Differences between home hemodialysis schedules= * When compared with the other schedules, nocturnal dialysis results in reduced strain on the heart during dialysis - the ultrafiltration rate (UFR) in nocturnal dialysis is lower than in CHD (and SDHHD) * Frequent nocturnal hemodialysis can improve left ventricular mass measures, reduce the need for blood pressure medications, improve some measures of mineral metabolism, and improve selected measures of quality of life. * When compared with other schedules, nocturnal dialysis results in higher clearance of large and medium-sized molecules (that are diffusion-limited). * Nocturnal dialysis and SDHHD treatment regimens provide a higher dialysis dose; they have a higher a std Kt/V and HDP than IHD treatment regimens. * Short dialysis (at home) five times a week is thought to reduce renal osteodystrophy. * SDHHD and nocturnal dialysis avoid large fluid shifts typical in IHD (that can cause nausea, cramping, and 'wash-out') after dialysis sessions. Advantages of nocturnal home hemodialysis Hemodialysis while sleeping * Better blood pressure management‚Äîless need for blood pressure medications. * Avoidance of intradialytic hypotension (i.e. low blood pressure during dialysis), something relatively common in IHD. * More energy and less 'wash-out' after treatment. * Decreased prevalence of sleep apnea or improvement in severe cases of sleep apnea - sleep better. * Less expensive overall for the health system due to lower rates of hospitalization and savings on nursing. * Less dietary restrictions‚Äîe.g., phosphate binders, kidney failure food restrictions. * More control over the dialysis treatment schedule and greater life satisfaction. * Live longer, according to a case-cohort study. *Cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients is the leading cause of mortality. Nocturnal hemodialysis is thought to improve ejection fraction (an important measure of cardiac function) and lead to a regression in left ventricular hypertrophy. A benefit of 6x/week nocturnal hemodialysis on left ventricular hypertrophy was demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial. Disadvantages of nocturnal home hemodialysis * Training is usually done during business hours, as often as five times a week. Training can take from 2 to 8 weeks at which time one is dialyzed incenter, often in a separate home hemodialysis training unit. * Introducing dialysis into the home will impact everyone in the home, for good and bad. * Space is needed for the dialysis machine and supplies. * One may face increased utility costs. (Some utilities have accommodations available) * Supply management may require time during business hours e.g. to receive deliveries, to drop off blood draws. * May require trip to center once a month for iron and case management. * If nocturnal dialysis is chosen some night's sleep can be disrupted due to machine alarms. Experience from LynchburgHome Dialysis Central, Types of Home Dialysis: Nocturnal Home Hemodialysis, URL: http://homedialysis.org/v1/types/nhh_01.shtml#10 , Accessed on July 15, 2005. suggests it happens once every 10 days for people using a fistula and 1-2 times per night if using a catheter. Barriers to home hemodialysis =Knowledge barriers= * Lack of awareness amongst patients - most patients with kidney disease in the USA are not informed of home hemodialysis as a treatment option for end-stage renal disease. One US study found that 36% of patients did not have contact with a nephrologist until less than 4 months prior to their first dialysis session and that only 12% of patients were offered home hemodialysis as a treatment option. * Lack of awareness for nephrologists. The lack of familiarity with home hemodialysis makes them less likely to offer it to suitable patients. =Patient factors:- in general= * Disability or frailty. * Patient fear of needles/self-cannulation. * Patient belief that they will get better care in hospital. * Lack of significant other to assist with HHD. Some clinics require a significant other and require that the significant other be trained. * Desire to compartmentalize disease - avoid creating a \\"sick home\\"; wish to think of illness only at treatment center. * Have suitable space and facilities or an area that could be adapted within their home environment * Have the ability and motivation to learn to carry out the process. * Commitment to maintain treatment. * Are stable on dialysis (see next section for further details on adherence issues) and free of complications and significant concomitant disease that would render home dialysis unsuitable or unsafe. =Patient factors:- barriers to home dialysis from non-adherence to regimes = * Fluid adherence is influenced by a heightened sense of thirst. * Possible cognitive executive functioning issues associated with uremia condition of end state kidney disease. This may affect memory, ability to plan effectively, and keeping to schedules. * High levels of depression and anxiety are also typically associated with end state kidney disease and the resulting life style changes, also contributing to reduced cognitive and behavioral functioning, and negative illness schemas. These factors may influence both motivation and capacity for adherence/compliance to regimes. =Patient factors:- addressing dialysis non-adherence= * Cognitive Behahavioural Therapy has been shown to be effective with dialysis patients to address levels of depression, specific phobias/fears, and to decrease levels of anxiety. * Use of psychoeducation to assist patient and carers understanding and insights into non-adherence issues. =Health care funding models= * Incenter dialysis and home hemodialysis are reimbursed to exactly the same amounts in the United States under the ESRD program. From CMS's point of view any form of dialysis is still more expensive than renal transplantation if looked at over a three-year period. A good kidney transplant (one that lasts five years) remains the cheapest long term renal replacement therapy. * In many jurisdictions doctors are not compensated to facilitate/encourage home dialysis; in the USA most kidney doctors are not paid for discussing different treatment options with their patients. In fact compared to the Medicare reimbursement if the doctor rounds incenter weekly, Medicare reimbursement to follow someone at home is less per month. * In the US to recoup the unreimbursed cost of training providers need people with Medicare as their primary insurer to dialyze at home for approximately one year. HHD requires a large initial capital expenditure, as each HHD patient requires their own dialysis machine and lengthy (expensive) training. Significant savings and benefits (for the society) from HHD are realized in the long term because of *# better health outcomes for patients and lower rates of hospitalization, *# higher productivity of ESRD patients (more can hold down steady jobs and contribute to society) and *# lower (nursing) labour costs. :Dialysis providers only stand to benefit from (3) (lower nursing costs) as the other costs (1) (poorer health) and (2) (lower productivity), as currently structured, are externalized to society. With the expensive training and hemodialysis equipment required, the return on investment is high only for long-term home hemodialysis patients. History of home hemodialysis Home hemodialysis started in the early 1960s. Who started it is in dispute. Groups in Boston, London, Seattle and Hokkaid≈ç all have a claim. The Hokkaid≈ç group was slightly ahead of the others, with Nos√©'s publication of his PhD thesis (in 1962), which described treating patients outside of the hospital for acute kidney injury due to drug overdoses. In 1963, he attempted to publish these cases in the ASAIO Journal but was unsuccessful, which was later described in the ASAIO Journal when people were invited to write about unconventional/crazy rejected papers. That these treatments took place in people's homes is hotly disputed by Shaldon and he has accused Nos√© of a faulty memory and not being completely honest, as allegedly revealed by some shared Polish Vodka, many years earlier. The Seattle group (originally the Seattle Artificial Kidney Center, later the Northwest Kidney Centers) started their home program in July 1964. It was inspired by the fifteen-year-old daughter of a collaborator's friend, who went into kidney failure due to lupus erythematosus, and had been denied access to dialysis by their patient selection committee. Dialysis treatment at home was the only alternative and managed to extend her life another four years. Dr. Chris Blagg has stated that the first training predated the establishment of the home program: the \\"first home patient wasn‚Äôt part of our program at all, he was president of a big Indian corporation, lived in Madras, and he came to Seattle just before I came in ‚Äô63. He came in early ‚Äô63, again, with his doctor and his wife and Dr. Scribner trained them to do dialysis at home and they went home to Madras.\\"Christopher Blagg, MD Transcript Voice Expeditions Oral History http://www.voiceexpeditions.com/index.php?id=287 In September 1964 the London group (led by Shaldon) started dialysis treatment at home. In the late 1960s, Shaldon introduced HHD in Germany. Home hemodialysis machines have changed considerably since the inception of the practice. Nos√©'s machine consisted of a coil (to transport the blood) placed in a household (electric) washing machine filled with dialysate. It did not have a pump and blood transport through the coil was dependent on the patient's heart. The dialysate was circulated by turning on the washing machine (which mixed the dialysate and resulted in some convection) and Nos√©'s experiments show that this indeed improved the clearance of toxins. In the USA there has been a large decline in home hemodialysis over the past 30 years. In the early 1970s, approximately 40% of patients used it. Today, it is used by approximately 0.4%. In other countries HNHD use is much higher. In Australia approximately 11% of ESRD patients use HNHD. The large decline in HHD seen in the 1970s and early 1980s is due to several factors. It coincides with the introduction and arise of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in the late 1970s, an increase in the age and the number of comorbidities (degree of \\"sickness\\") in the ESRD population, and, in some countries such USA, changes in how dialysis care is funded (which lead to more hospital-based hemodialysis). Home night- time (nocturnal) hemodialysis was first introduced by Baillod et al.Baillod R, Comty C Shaldon S. Overnight haemodialysis in the home. Proc. Eur. Dial. Transplant. Assoc. 1965; 2: 99-104. in the UK and grew popular in some centers, such as the Northwest Kidney Centers, but then declined in the 1970s (coinciding with the decline in HHD). Since the early 1990s, NHHD has become more popular again.

Equipment  NxStage System One cycler, being used for hemodialysis with bags of dialysate. Currently, three hemodialysis machines are used for home hemodialysis in the United States. They are made by B. Braun Melsungen, Fresenius and NxStage, a division of Fresenius Medical Care. The systems take different approaches to the process of dialysis. The B Braun is a standard hemodialysis machine is used incenter and at home. The Fresenius \\"Baby K\\" home machine is close to a standard hemodialysis machines, but somewhat more user friendly and smaller. Both the B Braun and the Fresenius Baby K requires a separate reverse osmosis water treatment system which allow dialysate flow rates generally from 300 to 800 ml/minute. The NxStage System One cycler uses far less dialysate per treatment with a maximum dialysate flow rate of 200 ml/minute but generally runs at rates less than 150 ml/minute. The NxStage System One can be used with bags of ultrapure dialysate - from 15 to 60 liters per treatment (see photo showing treatment in process). This allows the System One to be transportable; as of 2008 the company supports travel within the continental US and will assist travel to Alaska and Hawaii (travel to AK & HI will result in the patient having additional out of pocket costs). Generally, the supplies including the dialysate are delivered as they are scheduled to be used, either bimonthly or monthly but the amount of supplies can become a concern. The System One can also use a separate dialysate production device manufactured by NxStage - the PureFlow. The PureFlow uses a deionization process to create a 60, 50 or 40 liter batch of dialysate depending on the SAK (bag of dialysate concentrate) specified by the MD. A batch has a 96-hour shelf life and is usually used for two or three treatments, although some patients are using the entire 60, 50 or 40 liter batch for a single extended treatment. Frequency hemodialysis Patients on frequent daytime hemodialysis have done well on short sessions (1.5 hours) given 6 times per week, although this would total 9 hours per week, and is fewer hours per week than most patients being dialyzed 3x/week. When changing from a 3x/week to a 6x/week schedule, if total weekly time is left the same (each session length cut in half), patients typically will still remove a little bit more waste products initially than with conventional schedules, since the blood levels of toxins during the initial hour of dialysis are higher than in subsequent hours. Most patients treating themselves \\"daily\\" (6x/week) with daytime hemodialysis use session lengths of 2‚Äì3 hours. Longer session lengths give more benefit in terms of fluid and especially, phosphate removal. However, unless sessions are prolonged beyond 3‚Äì4 hours, almost all 6x/week patients will still require phosphate binders. Fluid and phosphate removal with \\"daily\\" dialysis are made more difficult because patients often feel better and increase protein (and thus also, phosphate) as well as fluid intake. When nocturnal dialysis is given 3 or 3.5 times (every other night) per week, the total weekly duration of dialysis is markedly prolonged, since each session typically lasts 6‚Äì8 hours, compared to 3‚Äì4 hours for conventional dialysis. This gives benefits in terms of fluid removal and phosphate removal, although about 1/2 to 2/3 of patients receiving this kind of treatment will still require phosphate binders. When such long nocturnal sessions are given 6x/week, in almost all patients phosphate binders can be stopped, and in a substantial number, phosphate needs to be added to the dialysate to prevent phosphate depletion. Because of the long weekly dialysis time, fluid removal is very well controlled, as the rate of ultrafiltration is quite low. Whereas adequacy of conventional dialysis is measured by urea reduction ratio URR or Kt/V, the question of adequacy of more frequent dialysis is based on opinion only and not on controlled trials. The KDOQI 2006 adequacy group, in their Clinical Practice Recommendations, suggested using the Standardized Kt/V as a minimum standard of adequacy for dialysis schedules other than 3x/week. A minimum standardized Kt/V value of 2.0 per week was suggested.

As a manager, he won two pennants and a world championship with the Milwaukee Braves. He later served as the first general manager of the expansion Los Angeles Angels in the American League. For years, Haney was one of the most popular baseball figures in Los Angeles. In 1974 he was presented with the King of Baseball award given by Minor League Baseball. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and raised in Los Angeles, Haney's major league playing career lasted all or part of seven seasons (1922‚Äì27, 1929). Primarily a third baseman‚Äîdespite his diminutive (5 feet, 6 inches/1.67 m) size‚ÄîHaney compiled a .275 batting average with 8 home runs and 229 RBI for the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. Much of his playing career was spent in his hometown with the city's two Pacific Coast League clubs, the original PCL Angels and the Hollywood Stars. He threw and batted right-handed. Manager and broadcaster Haney became a manager in 1936, piloting the Toledo Mud Hens of the AA American Association, the top farm team of the St. Louis Browns. In 1939, he took over the lowly Browns and the team lost 111 games. They improved by 24 games in 1940, but when the 1941 Brownies dropped 32 of their first 44 contests, Haney was replaced by Luke Sewell. After briefly returning to Toledo to manage through 1942, Haney went home to Los Angeles (and the Coast League) as the radio play-by-play broadcaster for the Hollywood Stars and Los Angeles Angels for six seasons, starting in 1943. In 1949, he moved back into the dugout as the manager of the Hollywood club. During his four years (1949‚Äì52) as manager, the Stars won two PCL pennants. As a reward, Haney was named manager of the Stars' parent club: the worst team in the National League, the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates rang up three last place finishes in Haney's 1953‚Äì55 tenure, losing 104, 101 and 94 games. Finally, he was given the pink slip by the Bucs, and he joined the Milwaukee Braves as a coach for 1956. Adversity turned into good fortune, however, when the Braves‚Äîslow out of the gate in '56‚Äîfired skipper Charlie Grimm on June 17 and turned to Haney. Milwaukee played at a .630 clip for the rest of the season and improved from fifth to second place, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers, securing Haney's tenure in the Beer City. Golden Era of Milwaukee Baseball During his tenure of a little more than 3 1/2 seasons, Haney led the Braves to their only two pennants and lone World Series championship in 13 years of existence (1953‚Äì65). Yet for all his managerial success in Milwaukee, Haney had more than his share of critics who believed it was largely the result of the immense talent around him. In 1957, with a lineup that included future Baseball Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Warren Spahn, and Red Schoendienst ‚Äì and stars such as Lew Burdette, Bob Buhl, Johnny Logan and Del Crandall ‚Äì the Braves won the National League pennant by eight games over the St. Louis Cardinals. During the regular season, Haney led the Braves in overcoming season-ending injuries to star first baseman Joe Adcock and fleet center fielder Bill Bruton, and slow starts to the season by their starting left fielder and second baseman, both of whom were traded in mid-June for Schoendienst. Then, led by Burdette's three complete-game victories in the World Series, the Braves defeated the New York Yankees in seven games ‚Äì including winning the crucial seventh game 5‚Äì0 at Yankee Stadium with Burdette pitching ‚Äì thus making him the World Series Most Valuable Player. Aaron received the National League Most Valuable Player award and Spahn won the lone Major League Cy Young Award (two Cy Young Awards were not given out per year until 1967). In 1958, the Milwaukee Braves repeated as champions in a league that was in transition, this time again by a margin of eight games. The core of the Braves team was once again Aaron, Matthews, Adcock, Spahn and Burdette. However, Buhl was limited to 11 appearances because of health issues, while Adcock played in only 105 games and Wes Covington in just 90 also because of injuries. Nonetheless, in Spahn and Burdette, the team had the best starter tandem in the majors. Spahn recorded a 22‚Äì11 record in 290 innings, while Burdette posted a 20‚Äì10 mark in 275 innings. The Braves finished first in the National League with a 92‚Äì62 record and returned to the World Series. The Yankees again won the American League, hence the two teams faced off against each other again in the World Series. The Braves roared ahead by winning three of the first four games in the series. The Yankees quickly regrouped, and they won Games 5, 6, 7 and the championship. The final two games were played at Milwaukee County Stadium. Many consider the turning point was Haney's controversial decision to start Burdette and Spahn on two days' rest each in the final two games, which had the appearance of a panic move, what with his team ahead 3-2 lead in the series. Some critics believe well-rested veteran Bob Rush would have been a wiser choice in Game 6, pointing to his effectiveness in the final two months of the regular season as well as in Game 3 of the series albeit it in a loss. That would have allowed Spahn, who had been victorious in his previous two starts, to open Game 7 if necessary on his accustomed three days' rest. At the same time, Burdette, who had struggled in his two starts, would have been available in the bullpen. Instead, Spahn pitched well in a 4-3, 10-inning loss in Game 6, then Burdette tired late in a 6-2 setback in the clincher. In 1959, the Braves were back in the thick of contention again, with the same core of regular players, and a stronger pitching staff, since Buhl came back to pitch 200 innings in 31 games, with a 15‚Äì9 record. Spahn and Burdette were brilliant, each with a 21‚Äì15 record in 290 innings pitched and a combined 41 complete games. Aaron and Matthews had prolific seasons. Aaron led the league with careers highs in 223 hits, .355 batting average and 400 total bases. He had 39 home runs, 123 RBI and led the league in slugging percentage. Matthews paced the team with 46 home runs and batted in 114 runs. The Braves finished in a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers for first place, both with records of 86 wins and 68 losses. This forced the two teams into a best-of-three-games playoff. Once again, Haney bypassed Rush and others in favor of inexperienced starter Carlton Willey in Game 1, a 3-2 loss in Milwaukee. The Dodgers completed the two-game sweep the next day, 6-5, to capture the pennant in Haney's hometown of Los Angeles. A short time later, Haney, approaching the age of 61, was dismissed as Braves manager, and he was replaced by the former Dodger coach Chuck Dressen. In his guide to baseball managers, author Bill James makes a detailed case for considering Haney's 1959 season at the helm of the Braves as the worst performance by an MLB manager. As he puts it: \\"Without exaggeration, the 1959 Dodgers shouldn't have been within 20 games of the Braves In reality, the two teams ended up playing a three-game playoff, which the Dodgers swept in two games. Among Haney's mistakes that season: riding his two top pitchers, Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette into the ground while ignoring a number of talented youngsters who were available to pitch; platooning Joe Adcock with the awful Frank Torre long after Torre had demonstrated he was in a year-long slump; failing to settle on a solution when second baseman Red Schoendienst was lost for the season; and loading his bench with a group of grumpy and over-the-hill veterans from which he failed to get any production.\\" With his other two \\"near misses\\", Haney stands as by far the most successful manager of the Braves' years in Milwaukee. His career managing record ‚Äî tarnished by poor teams in St. Louis and Pittsburgh ‚Äî was 629‚Äì757 (). He won 341 games and lost 231 () with the Braves. The Move West At right actor William Frawley receives from Haney a lifetime pass to Angels games during a January 1961 episode of This Is Your Life Haney was not out of work long. In 1960 he made a brief return to broadcasting, teaming with Lindsey Nelson to call weekend baseball for NBC television. The following year, the American League granted an expansion team to Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Angels, and its owner, Gene Autry, chose Haney to operate the team and its organization for him. While the Angels usually struggled on the playing field during Haney's tenure as GM from 1961 to 1968, they did finish a surprising third in 1962, and contended for the 1967 pennant as well. Haney made the team competitive in its early years by selecting future stars such as the shortstop Jim Fregosi and the pitcher Dean Chance in the expansion draft, and acquiring sluggers such as Leon Wagner and Lee Thomas. Haney also oversaw the Angels' relocation in 1966 from Chavez Ravine down the freeway to Anaheim Stadium in Orange County. Upon his retirement at the end of the 1968 baseball season, Haney became a part-time consultant for the California Angels, and he was succeeded as the team's general manager by Dick Walsh. Haney died of a heart attack on November 9, 1977, at age 81 in Beverly Hills, California. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Having devoted great attention to the study of botany, he went to Athens in 1835 as inspector of the court garden; and in April 1836 he became professor of botany at the university. In 1842 he returned to Germany and became teacher at the central agricultural school at Schlei√üheim. In 1847 he was appointed professor of agriculture at Munich, and in 1851 director of the central veterinary college.

The tube extends nearly all the way into the bottom bulb, and attaches to the top bulb but does not extend into it. The space inside the bird contains a fluid, usually colored. The fluid is typically dichloromethane, also known as methylene chloride. Earlier versions contained trichlorofluoromethane. Miles V.

The bird is typically decorated with paper eyes, a plastic top hat, and one or more tail feathers. The whole setup pivots on an adjustable crosspiece attached to the neck. Despite the drinking bird's appearance and classification as a toy there is a potential danger of thin shards of glass should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances, though the fluid in later versions is nonflammable. Dichloromethane can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs if inhaled. It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen. Heat engine steps right The drinking bird is a heat engine that exploits a temperature difference to convert heat energy to a pressure difference within the device, and performs mechanical work. Like all heat engines, the drinking bird works through a thermodynamic cycle. The initial state of the system is a bird with a wet head oriented vertically. The process operates as follows: # The water evaporates from the felt on the head. # Evaporation lowers the temperature of the glass head (heat of vaporization). # The temperature decrease causes some of the dichloromethane vapor in the head to condense. # The lower temperature and condensation together cause the pressure to drop in the head (governed by Equations of state). # The higher vapor pressure in the warmer base pushes the liquid up the neck. # As the liquid rises, the bird becomes top heavy and tips over. # When the bird tips over, the bottom end of the neck tube rises above the surface of the liquid in the bottom bulb. # A bubble of warm vapor rises up the tube through this gap, displacing liquid as it goes. # Liquid flows back to the bottom bulb (the toy is designed so that when it has tipped over the neck's tilt allows this). Pressure equalizes between top and bottom bulbs. # The weight of the liquid in the bottom bulb restores the bird to its vertical position # The liquid in the bottom bulb is heated by ambient air, which is at a temperature slightly higher than the temperature of the bird's head. If a glass of water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will continue to absorb water and the cycle will continue as long as there is enough water in the glass to keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head; for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine. The ultimate source of energy is the temperature gradient between the toy's head and base; the toy is not a perpetual motion machine. Physical and chemical principles Video The Engineering of the Drinking Bird The drinking bird is an exhibition of several physical laws and is therefore a staple of basic chemistry and physics education. These include: * The dichloromethane with a low boiling point (39.6 ¬∞C, 103.28 ¬∞F under standard pressure p ~~o~~ = 105 Pa - as the drinking bird is first evacuated, partially filled and sealed, the pressure and thus the boiling point in the drinking bird will be different), gives the heat engine the ability to extract motion from low temperatures. The drinking bird is a heat engine that works at room temperature. * The combined gas law, which establishes a proportional relationship between temperature and pressure exerted by a gas in a constant volume. * The ideal gas law, which establishes a proportional relationship between number of gas particles and pressure in a constant volume. * The Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, which establishes that molecules in a given space at a given temperature vary in energy level, and therefore can exist in multiple phases (solid/liquid/gas) at a single temperature. * Heat of vaporization (or condensation), which establishes that substances absorb (or give off) heat when changing state at a constant temperature. * Torque and center of mass. * Capillary action of the wicking felt. * Wet-bulb temperature: The temperature difference between the head and body depends on the relative humidity of the air. By considering the difference between the wet and dry bulb temperatures, it is possible to develop a mathematical expression to calculate the maximum work that can be produced from a given amount of water \\"drunk\\". Such analysis is based on the definition of the Carnot heat engine efficiency and the psychrometric concepts. History By the 1760s (or earlier) German artisans had invented a so-called \\"pulse hammer\\" (Pulshammer). In 1767 Benjamin Franklin visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it.See: * Benjamin Franklin's letter to John Winthrop of 2 July 1768 * * Franklin's pulse hammer consisted of two glass bulbs connected by a U-shaped tube; one of the bulbs was partially filled with water in equilibrium with its vapor. Holding the partially filled bulb in one's hand would cause the water to flow into the empty bulb.For videos of Franklin's pulse hammer in operation, see: * Pulse Glass * Franklin's pulse glass In 1872, the Italian physicist and engineer Enrico Bernardi combined three Franklin tubes to build a simple heat motor that was powered by evaporation in a way similar to the drinking bird.See:   In 1881 Israel L. Landis got a patent for a similar oscillating motor.US250821 A year later (1882), the Iske brothers got a patent for a similar motor.https://www.google.com/patents/US253868 Unlike the drinking bird, the lower tank was heated and the upper tank just air-cooled in this engine. Other than that, it used the same principle. The Iske brothers during that time got various patents on a related engine which is now known as Minto wheel. A Chinese drinking bird toy dating back to 1910s~1930s named insatiable birdie is described in Yakov Perelman's Physics for Entertainment. The book explained the \\"insatiable\\" mechanism: \\"Since the headtube's temperature becomes lower than that of the tail reservoir, this causes a drop in the pressure of the saturated vapours in the head-tube ...\\" It was said in Shanghai, China, that when Albert Einstein and his wife, Elsa, arrived in Shanghai in 1922, they were fascinated by the Chinese \\"insatiable birdie\\" toy.Alice Calaprice and Trevor Lipscombe, Albert Einstein: A Biography (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005):86‚Äì87. In addition, the Japanese professor of toys, Takao Sakai, from Tohoku University, also introduced this Chinese toy. Arthur M. Hillery got a patent in 1945. Arthur M. Hillery suggested the use of acetone as working fluid. This Chinese invention was again patented in the US by Miles V. Sullivan in 1946. He was a Ph.D. inventor-scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, USA.\\"Dr. Sullivan also holds patents on several novelty items such as the well-known drinking bird.\\" Electrochemical technology: Volume 6 1968\\"Miles V.

Sullivan 1945 Notable usage in popular culture The drinking bird has been used in many fictional contexts to automatically press buttons. In The Simpsons episode \\"King-Size Homer\\", Homer used one to repeatedly press a key on a computer keyboard. Herb Powell also showed one to Homer as part of a demonstration regarding inventions in the episode \\"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\\". Two of them were used in the 1990 film Darkman to set off explosions. Drinking birds have appeared as part of a Rube Goldberg machine in the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure (with video) and the Family Guy episode \\"8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter\\". Drinking birds have been featured as plot elements in the 1951 Merrie Melodies cartoon Putty Tat Trouble and the 1968 science fiction thriller The Power. They have also had minor appearances in several movies and TV shows, including mission briefings in two episodes of TV's original Mission: Impossible, the Woody Allen movie Sleeper, the 1979 science fiction film Alien (also referenced in Alien 3 and Alien: Covenant), the 1989 comedy When Harry Met Sally..., the 2008 film Max Payne, the 2010 film Megamind, and episodes of the American TV shows The Simpsons, Mad Men and Ed, Edd n Eddy. Episode 508 of Mystery Science Theater 3000 features a spoof of the drinking bird called the Bobbing Buzzard, which runs on carrion instead of water. Among video games, the drinking bird appeared as the \\"dunkin' dragon\\" in the Sierra game Quest for Glory (1989), in the Gremlin Interactive game Normality (1996), and as a \\"water bird\\" furniture item in the Animal Crossing games (2001). Porygon2, a Pok√©mon introduced in Generation II (Pok√©mon Gold and Silver), resembles a drinking bird, and in 3D Pok√©mon games, it moves its head in a \\"dipping\\" motion. More recently, in the game Quantum Conundrum (2012), one of the main gameplay mechanics is a drinking bird that is used as a timer to press buttons. In the 2014 Creative Assembly video game Alien: Isolation, drinking birds are frequently seen on desks across the game's main setting, Sevastopol Station. In Australian contemporary playwright John Romeril's play The Floating World, drinking birds are a symbolic prop which represent the progression of Les's insanity.https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/reading-australia/john- romeril/the-floating-world-by-john-romeriltitle=Reading Australia: 'The Floating World' by John Romeril They are referred to as \\"dippy birds\\" and are perhaps used to symbolize such a thing due to Romeril's opinion of drinking birds being that they are insane for their uselessness and repeatability.  Alternative design  In 2003 an alternative mechanism was devised by Nadine Abraham and Peter Palffy-Muhoray of Ohio, USA, that utilizes capillary action combined with evaporation to produce motion, but has no volatile working fluid. Their paper \\"A Dunking Bird of the Second Kind\\" , was submitted to the American Journal of Physics, and published in June 2004. It describes a mechanism which, while similar to the original drinking bird, operates without a temperature difference. Instead it utilizes a combination of capillary action, gravitational potential difference and the evaporation of water to power the device. This bird works as follows: it is balanced such that, when dry, it tips into a head-down position. The bird is placed next to a water source such that this position brings its beak into contact with water. Water is then lifted into the beak by capillary action (the authors used a triangular sponge) and carried by capillary action past the fulcrum to a larger sponge reservoir which they fashioned to resemble wings. When enough water has been absorbed by the reservoir, the now-heavy bottom causes the bird to tip into a head-up position. With the beak out of the water, eventually enough water evaporates from the sponge that the original balance is restored and the head tips down again. Although a small drop in temperature may occur due to evaporative cooling, this does not contribute to the motion of the bird. The device operates relatively slowly with 7 hours 22 minutes being the average cycle time measured.

It was published in May 2000 by Eos. Heavy on the physics information, Eater describes humankind's encounter with a cosmic intelligence that comes in the form of a small black hole. Plot summary In the early 21st century, astronomers detect what appears to be a distant gamma-ray burster, a black hole engulfing another star many light years away. The data is bizarre and troubling, because only 13 hours later, a second burster appears, which, given the great distance between stars, would be impossible. Eventually, the astronomers realize that the black hole, rather than being incredibly far from us, is actually heading towards the Solar System, and moving our way at considerable speed. Stranger still, it seems to be moving under its own will; it is an intelligent being itself. This age-old cosmic being reveals that it had been born seven billion years ago and had become a wandering entity, feeding on asteroids, planets and various space debris, projecting itself forward in space through the process. Through the billions of years of its existence across the expanse of time and space, this intelligent entity has learned of many ancient civilizations in the universe. The black hole eventually sends a message to the people of Earth; it \\"desires converse\\". The black hole is willing to share the knowledge it had gained throughout the ages in return for the chance to \\"chat\\" with the humans. But eventually, something about the nature of the life-form is revealed. It prefers to learn about people by having their minds uploaded to it and demands that the best and brightest of Earth be sent to it in this way. The three astronomer protagonists: Benjamin Knowlton; his cancer-stricken wife, Channing; and the British Astronomer Royal, Kingsley Dart, must save the Earth and all of humanity from annihilation at the hands of this entity that they dub the Eater.

SKS Biografiakeskus Biography Nordmann was a son of an officer of the Russian army at the Ruotsinsalmi fortress, SE Finland. He started academic studies at the Imperial Academy of Turku, and at that time also acted as a curator of the entomological collections. In 1827 he continued studies in Berlin with the famous parasitologist and anatomist Karl Rudolphi. His first major work was a microscopical description of tens of parasitic worms and crustaceans from the eyes and other organs of fishes and other animals, including man. These included the enigmatic monogenean Diplozoon paradoxum. In 1832 he was appointed a professor (teacher) at the Lyceum Richelieu in Odessa, Ukraine, and in 1834 also the director of the Odessa Botanical Garden and the associated Central Gardening School. He participated in several expeditions and collected natural history specimens in southern Russia and adjacent regions. Later, in 1849, he became professor of Zoology and Botany at the Imperial Alexander University in Finland (Helsinki). He died of heart failure on 25 June 1866. Taxa The cladoceran Evadne nordmanni, the Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana and at least seven other species and one genus (Nordmannia) have been named after him.

Procompsognathus was a small-sized, lightly built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore, that could grow up to 1 m (3.3 ft) long. Discovery and naming The fragmentary and poorly preserved skeleton of Procompsognathus was found in the Middle Stubensandstein member of the L√∂wenstein Formation at the Wei√üe Steinbruch, the quarry of Albert Burrer on the northern slopes of the Stromberg region near Pfaffenheim in W√ºrttemberg, Germany.E. Fraas. 1907. Aetosaurus crassicauda n. sp. nebst Beobachtungen √ºber das Becken der Aetosaurier [Aetosaurus crassicauda n. sp. together with observations on the pelvis of aetosaurs]. Mitteilungen aus dem K√∂niglichen Naturalien-Kabinett zu Stuttgart 42:101-109 The discovery was made by Albert Burrer in the spring of 1909 in white sandstone and gray/blue marl sediments that were deposited during the Norian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 210 million years ago. The holotype SMNS 12591, consisted of three blocks of sandstone: one showed a small, seven-centimetre-long, severely crushed skull with lower jaws. The second and third contained the partly articulated remains of a postcranial skeleton, including twenty-nine vertebrae of the neck, back and tail; ribs; elements of the shoulder girdle and a forelimb; an ilium; both pubis and the hindlimbs. It represents an adult individual. Burrer sent the specimen to Professor Eberhard Fraas of the k√∂nigliche Stuttgarter Naturalienkabinett. In a lecture on 9 October 1911, Fraas referred to it by the name \\"Hallopus celerrimus\\", considering it jumping form of dinosaur that was approximately long, and was associated with the origin of birds.Fraas, E., 1911, \\"Die schw√§bische Dinosaurier\\", Jahreshefte des Vereins f√ºr vaterl√§ndische Naturkunde in W√ºrttemberg 1912: LXVI-LXVII Later, Fraas decided to use a different name in the official publication.Pompeckj, J.F., 1915, \\"Zur Erinnerung an Eberhard Fraas und an sein Werk\\", Jahreshefte des Vereins f√ºr vaterl√§ndische Naturkunde in W√ºrttemberg 1924: XXXIII Fraas in 1913 named the genus Procompsognathus with as type species, Procompsognathus triassicus.Fraas, E., 1913, \\"Die neuesten Dinosaurierfunde in der schw√§bischen Trias\\", Naturwissenschaften 1(45): 1097-1100 The type specimen is housed in the collection of the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany. In 1921, Friedrich von Huene referred two more specimens, both also found in the Burrer quarry, in 1908, to Procompsognathus: SMNS 12352, a partial skull and lower jaws from a larger individual than the holotype, and SMNS 12352a, an isolated left hand.Von Huene, F., 1921, \\"Neue Pseudosuchier und Coelurosaurier aus dem w√ºrttembergischen Keuper\\", Acta Zoologica 2: 329-403 The genus name Procompsognathus, means \\"before elegant jaw\\", and is derived from the name of another dinosaur, Compsognathus. A later (Jurassic) small predatory dinosaur, Compsognathus takes its name from the Greek word kompsos (Œ∫ŒøŒºœàœåœÇ) which can be rendered as \\"elegant\\", \\"refined\\" or \\"dainty\\" and the Greek word gnathos (Œ≥ŒΩŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ) which means \\"jaw\\". The prefix Pro (œÄœÅŒø) implies \\"before\\" or \\"ancestor of\\", although this direct lineage was not supported by subsequent research. The specific name triassicus refers to the geologic time period to which this dinosaur belongs, the Triassic. Description Life restoration Procompsognathus may have been about long,Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. though Fraas in 1913 estimated a length of . In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave an estimate of for the weight with a length of .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 72 A biped, Procompsognathus had long hind legs, short arms, large clawed hands, a long slender snout with many small teeth, and a stiff tail. The femur discovered for the type specimen of this genus measures 93mm and the tibia, 112mm. The tibia is approximately 20% longer than the femur in Procompsognathus, an adaptation which has been strongly correlated with the development of cursorial habits in dinosaurs, suggesting that they were good runners.Coombs, W. P., Jr. 1978. Theoretical aspects of cursorial adaptations in dinosaurs. The Quarterly Review of Biology 53:393‚Äì418. =Distinguishing anatomical features= A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. In 2000, Rauhut noted that its scapula is more slender than that of Coelophysis bauri. In 1998 Chatterjee noted that the skull of Procompsognathus possesses a suite of theropod synapomorphies, which included: * the presence of an accessory maxillary fenestra * the vomers are fused rostrally and are extended considerably forward to the choana * the single quadrate head is received completely by squamosal without paroccipital contact * the lateroshenoid possesses a transverse postorbital process * the orbitosphenoids are fused Classification =Type specimen SMNS 12591= While it is undoubtedly a small, bipedal carnivore, the extremely poor preservation of the only known Procompsognathus fossil makes its exact identity difficult to determine. Fraas originally assigned it to the Dinosauria. In 1923 Franz Nopcsa coined a Procompsognathinae, and in 1929 von Huene created a Procompsognathidae, though these concepts are today rarely used. In 1932 von Huene saw it as a member of the non-dinosaurian Pseudosuchia.von Huene, F., 1932, Die fossile Reptil- Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte. Monographien f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie, 4, pp. 361 It has since then usually been considered a theropod dinosaur, with some exceptions. In 1992 Paul Sereno and Rupert Wild stated that the holotype specimen consisted of fossils from two separate animals: the postcranial skeleton would be a theropod, likely a coelophysoid related to Segisaurus, but the skull and the von Huene specimens they referred to the basal crocodylomorph Saltoposuchus connectens. However, in 1993 Sankar Chatterjee after further preparation refuted their assessment and regarded the skull as that of a theropod similar to Syntarsus, and demonstrated that it could not have been a crocodylomorph, as it lacks the landmark features of this group.Chatterjee, S., 1993, \\"Procompsognathus from the Triassic of Germany is not a crocodylomorph\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 13(3): 29AChatterjee, S., 1998, \\"Reassessment of the Procompsognathus skull\\", p. 6 in: Wolberg, D.L., Gittis, K., Miller, S., Carey, L., and A. Raynor (eds.), Dinofest International. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Sereno (1997) and Ezcurra and Novas (2007) conducted phylogenetic analysis that supported the placement of Procompsognathus in the taxon Coelophysidae.P.

Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 25(4): 835-849. =Referred specimens SMNS 12352 and SMNS 12352a= Much controversy has arisen however, about the association with the later material referred by von Huene. In 1982 John Ostrom claimed that SMNS 12352 and SMNS 12352a originated from a taxon different from the holotype. In 2006 and 2008 Fabien Knoll concluded that SMNS 12352 represented a crocodylomorph and SMNS 12352a a crocodylomorph or some other basal archosaur. The postcranial skeleton, for which he reserved the inventory number SMNS 12591, was a coelophysoid; and the skull, now indicated with the number SMNS 12591a, a perhaps more derived theropod, possibly a basal member of the Tetanurae.Knoll, F. & Schoch, R., 2006, \\"Does Procompsognathus have a head?

(2000). \\"A review of European Triassic theropods.\\" Gaia 15, 75-88 and Carrano et al.

Entrance to the College was through the churchyard, with no direct road access (although secondary access is now provided). The College has a central reception and bakehouse room, beyond which are six individual residences on two storeys (of the one-up, one-down style). Eyton specified that each of the six residences was to be occupied by the widow of a Clerk in holy orders, who must have been a clergyman of the Church of England (the Welsh Anglican church was not yet independent of England in 1750), who had been \\"in possession of a cure of souls\\" (in office) within the County of Merioneth at the time of his death. Today the original College building is in good order, and easily accessible by means of a path from the church or an independent access. It is in use as a retreat centre, and its original layout is largely intact. It is a grade II* listed building.Listing status.

Fall (November 19, 1926 ‚Äì February 21, 1967) was a prominent war correspondent, historian, political scientist, and expert on Indochina during the 1950s and 1960s. Born in Austria, he moved with his family to France as a child after Germany's annexation, where he started fighting for the French Resistance at the age of sixteen, and later the French Army during World War II. In 1950 he first came to the United States for graduate studies at Syracuse University and Johns Hopkins University, returning and making his residence there. He taught at Howard University for most of his career and made regular trips to Southeast Asia to learn about changes and the societies. He predicted the failures of France and the United States in the wars in Vietnam because of their tactics and lack of understanding of the societies. He was killed by a landmine while accompanying United States Marines on a patrol in 1967. Early life Bernard Fall was born in Vienna, Austria to Jewish parents Leo Fall and Anna Seligman. His family migrated in 1938 when he was a child to live in France, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. After France fell to Germany in 1940, his father Leo Fall aided the French Resistance. Leo Fall was captured, tortured and killed by the Gestapo. His mother was also captured and deported to Auschwitz, where she died. In 1942, at the age of sixteen, Bernard Fall followed in his father's footsteps and joined the French Resistance, after which time he fought the Germans in the Alps. As France was being liberated in 1944, Fall joined the French Army, in which he served until 1946. For his service, he was awarded the French Liberation Medal. Following World War II, Fall worked as an analyst for the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal, in which capacity he investigated Krupp Industries. Academic career Fall studied at the University of Paris from 1948 to 1949, and from 1949 to 1950 he attended the University of Munich. After completing his studies in Europe, Fall traveled to the United States in 1950 on a Fulbright Scholarship, where he studied at the University of Maryland for a time. In 1951, Fall enrolled at Syracuse University, where he received a masters degree in political science in 1952. Fall did post-graduate study at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, where he was encouraged to study Indochina. Fall took the idea to heart. Not content to study Indochina from afar, Fall traveled to Vietnam in 1953, when the First Indochina War was being waged between the Viet Minh and French Union forces. Due to his French citizenship, Fall was allowed to accompany French soldiers and pilots into enemy territory. From his observations, Fall predicted the French would fail in Vietnam. When the French were defeated in the critical Battle of Dien Bien Phu, Fall claimed the United States was partly responsible for France's loss. Fall believed that the United States had not supported France to a sufficient extent during the First Indochina War. In 1954, Fall returned to the United States and married Dorothy Winer. In 1955, he earned a doctorate from Syracuse University and became an assistant professor at American University in Washington, DC. In 1956, he began teaching international relations courses at Howard University, also in Washington. Fall became a full professor at Howard in 1962 and taught there intermittently until his death. Never losing his interest in Indochina, Fall returned to the region five more times (in 1957, 1962, 1965, 1966, and 1967) to study developments firsthand. Fall was given a grant by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to study the development of communism in Southeast Asia. He used it to document the rise of communist activity in Laos. Fall was particularly interested in the tensions between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. While teaching at the Royal Institute of Administration in Cambodia in 1962, Fall was invited to interview Ho Chi Minh and Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng in Hanoi. Ho Chi Minh told Fall his belief that communism would prevail in South Vietnam in about a decade's time. Fall was a political scientist, but one who had been a soldier and who spoke the soldier's language and lived the soldier's life at the front line. He obtained his data on the war while slogging through the mud of Vietnam with French colonial troops, with American infantry, and with South Vietnamese soldiers. He combined the usual academic analysis of Indochina with a perspective of the war from the soldier's point of view. Vietnam War Fall supported the American military presence in South Vietnam, believing it could stop the country from falling to Communism, but he strongly criticized Ngo Dinh Diem's American-backed regime and the tactics used by the United States military in Vietnam. As the conflict between the American forces and the Communists in Vietnam escalated throughout the 1960s, Fall became increasingly pessimistic about the U.S.'s chances of success. He predicted that if it did not learn from France's mistakes, it too would fail in Vietnam. Fall wrote extensive articles detailing his analysis of the situation in Vietnam, and lectured a great deal about his ideas on the Vietnam War. Fall's research was considered invaluable to many U.S. diplomats and military officials, but his negative opinions were often not taken seriously. By 1964, Fall concluded that the U.S. forces in Vietnam were losing. Fall's dire predictions caught the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which began to monitor his activities.Fall, Dorothy (2006). Bernard Fall : memories of a soldier-scholar. Washington, D.C.: Potomac Books. . OCLC 64442861. Many have noted Fall's accuracy and comprehension in his writing about the Vietnam War. In Colin Powell's 1995 autobiography, My American Journey, he wrote: Noam Chomsky has called Fall \\"the most respected analyst and commentator on the Vietnam War.\\" =Death= Towards the end of his life Fall suffered from retroperitoneal fibrosis which resulted in the loss of a kidney and a colon blockage. According to his wife, his condition engendered a sense of fatalism as he departed for what turned out to be his final trip to Vietnam. On 21 February 1967, while accompanying a company of the 1st Battalion 9th Marines on Operation Chinook II in the Street Without Joy, Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province, Fall stepped on a Bouncing Betty land mine which killed both him and Gunnery Sergeant Byron G. Highland, a U.S. Marine Corps combat photographer. He was dictating notes into a tape recorder, which captured his last words: \\"We've reached one of our phase lines after the firefight and it smells bad‚Äîmeaning it's a little bit suspicious... Could be an amb‚Äî\\". Fall was survived by his wife and three daughters. Legacy and honors The medical library at the main civilian hospital in Da Nang was named The Bernard B.

The sea near Point Lobos is considered one the best locations for scuba diving on the Monterey Peninsula and along the California coast. Point Lobos is just south of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, United States, and at the north end of the Big Sur coast of the Pacific Ocean. Point Lobos features a number of hiking trails, many alongside the ocean, and a smaller number of beaches. The historic Whalers Cabin, built by Chinese fishermen and later used by Japanese and Portuguese fishermen, is now a museum. Point Lobos nearly became the site of a town. In 1896, the Carmelo Land and Coal Company subdivided the land into 1,000 lots and named the new town \\"Carmelito\\". Engineer Alexander Allan purchased the land and over many years bought back the lots that had been sold and erased the subdivision from the county records. , more than one million annual visitors from around the world visited Point Lobos, which is restricted by only 150 on-site parking spaces.

Visitor levels are exceeding the capacity of the Reserve and the state is considering requiring reservations during peak hours.  Geography and natural features  thumb Rocky coast at low tide Wildflowers at Pt. Lobos, 2006 The Point Lobos area is geologically unique and contains a rich and diverse plant and animal life both on shore and in the water. Called the \\"greatest meeting of land and water in the world\\" by Australian-born artist landscape artist Francis McComas, Point Lobos is considered the \\"crown jewel\\" of the California state park system. The geological history of Point Lobos describes the rocks that create the headlands and inlets that make Point Lobos famous. The Carmel submarine canyon lies just north of Point Lobos. Like Monterey Canyon to the north the canyon provides cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface during upwelling events. These nutrient-rich waters fuel the high primary productivity seen in Carmel and Monterey Bays, which in turn support the high diversity of life observed in the water and on land at Point Lobos. Point Lobos is one of only two places where the Monterey Cypress are native.C.Michael Hogan and Michael P. Frankis. 2009. Monterey Cypress: Cupressus macrocarpa, GlobalTwitcher.com ed. N.

Gray, humpback, and blue whales are regular visitors to the area.  Recreation and visitor impact  The reserve has several miles of trails. Visitors can view the coastal scenery, explore the coast, and picnic. California's marine protected areas encourage recreational and educational uses of the ocean. The quality of the underwater environment in the adjacent marine protected areas draws a large number of scuba divers.

The Chinese used locally sourced pine and redwood for siding. The floor was originally dirt. The floor joists are supported by six whale vertebrae that rest on granite blocks quarried nearby. Originally, the floor was packed earth. There were originally about 10 cabins around the cove. The cabin may have been used by Portuguese whalers from the Azores, who harpooned whales off the coast and hauled their carcasses onshore at the cove. The Carmel Whaling Company operated from 1862 to 1879. From 1854 to the end of shore-based whaling in about 1900, there were only 16 shore whaling stations in California, with about 300 men involved. When kerosene oil was introduced in about 1880, whale oil became too expensive. Whaling was briefly reintroduced by the Japanese Whaling Company from 1898 to 1900. When the last resident moved out of the cabin in 1983, a park docent suggested turning the cabin into a museum. Improvements added after the Chinese era, like fiberboard walls and ceiling, wiring, and pipes were removed. Docents contacted descendants of the families who lived and worked at the cove to solicit contributions. California state parks exhibit specialists built displays around the artifacts. It is the only building of this era that has been preserved. It houses the Whaling Station Museum dedicated to the cultural history of the point. The museum also highlights the history of Point Lobos, including its cinematic appearances and plans at the turn of the 20th century to develop the area for densely packed suburban housing.Bertao, David. The Portuguese Shore Whalers of California, 1854-1904. San Jose, CA: Portuguese Heritage Publications, 2006. Page 106.  History  Plot map of planned Point Lobos City, September 1890 The Ohlone people harvested shellfish including abalone from the waters around Point Lobos. Evidence has been found of a long-term village named Ichxenta, in a meadow near San Jose Creek adjacent to Point Lobos, that indicates the natives inhabited the area for about 2,500 years. The village meadow is currently known as the Polo Field. There are 19 midden sites within Point Lobos and five sites containing mortar holes used by the natives for grinding acorns and seeds. It is likely that Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no or some of his soldiers, who camped near the mouth of the Carmel River in 1602‚Äì03, may have visited the area to the south. Gaspar de Portol√† and his exploring party camped at San Jose Creek in October 1769. Sergeant Jose Francisco Ortega conducted a study of the coast south of the Carmel River. In about 1770, Spanish vaqueros from nearby Carmel Mission ran large herds of cattle in the area near Point Lobos. Ichxenta was likely occupied until near the end of the Carmel Mission era, when the native population was decimated by disease, starvation, overwork, torture, and forced assimilation. = Spanish and Mexican era = Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado granted Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito, two square leagues of land, in 1839 to Marcelino Escobar, Alcalde (or mayor) of Monterey, Alta California. The grant was from the south side of Carmel River, including Point Lobos, south to Palo Colorado Canyon. Two of Escobar's sons, Juan and Agustin, obtained possession of the rancho shortly afterward, and sold it on August 26, 1841 to Do≈àa Maria Josefa de Abrego, who held power of attorney for her husband Jos√© Abrego to buy and sell land. She paid $250, one-half in silver, and one-half in gold, or about three cents per acre. Ownership of Point Lobos was later complicated by the fact that when Juan and Augustin Escobar sold the rancho to Josefa de Abrego in 1841, they didn't obtain permission from their multiple brothers and sisters. The siblings later contested the sale.Aubrey Drury, 1954, Point Lobos Reserve, California State Park, Department of Natural Resources, Sacramento, p. 78‚Äì85 Under somewhat mysterious circumstances, on January 16, 1843, Maria Abrego deeded the rancho to a group of about 10 soldiers from the Monterey Presidio. Records confirm the soldiers paid nothing, and a legend attached to the transfer says a gambler lost a rancho in a card game. Her husband was known for his gambling habit. On June 7, 1844, the soldiers turned the Rancho over to their superior officer, Colonel Jos√© Castro, former Governor Alvarado's brother-in-law. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Mexico ceded California to the United States. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. But the Land Act of 1851 required owners to prove their ownership. Castro filed a claim on February 2, 1853, but grew impatient with the outcome and sold the land in 1854 to Joseph S. Emery and Abner Bassett for $700, leaving to them the legal fight for ownership. The commission denied Castro's claim on August 28, 1855. Castro died in 1860. Emery and Bassett appealed the court's ruling. Bassett died in 1874, leaving his undivided one-half interest to his wife and eight children. Their half of the rancho was appraised at $15,000. In 1880, a lawsuit was filed in United States District Court to resolve the conflicting claims of more than two dozen putative property owners and squatters. On June 5, 1882, subject to confirmation of the original claim by Castro, the judges divided Escobar's original land grant into 34 parcels. Later that year, Castro's original claim was validated by the court. The title was confirmed on December 24, 1885, and President Grover Cleveland signed the land patent on May 4, 1888, 35 years after Castro's initial filing. All of the 34 claims from the 1880 lawsuit were invalidated as a result. = Industrial period = In 1851 a Chinese sailor, Quock Junk, ran aground at Point Lobos. He was rescued by members of the Ohlone tribe. He was later joined by four or five other Chinese families who built cottages at Whaler's Cove. They became the first commercial fishermen at the point. From 1854‚Äì1858, a granite quarry was operated at what was later named Whaler's Cove. The granite was used to build the Old Monterey Jail, San Francisco Mint, portions of Fort Point, and buildings on the Navy's installation at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. In 1862, Antonio Victorine, a Portuguese whaler from the Azores, arrived at Point Lobos, following the whale population. About fifty to seventy family members lived at Whaler's Cove. The men spotted whales from Whaler's Knoll and then rowed off shore about in 24-foot boats to harpoon the whales. They towed the whales back to Pt. Lobos to fleece and harvest the blubber. They then towed the carcasses back out to sea. Headstock of the Carmelo Land and Coal Company mine in upper Malpaso Canyon, south of Carmel, California, in 1895. In 1874, a seam of low grade bituminous coal was found in upper Malpaso Canyon, southeast of Pt Lobos. On September 6, 1888, shortly after the patent for Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito was approved, almost all of the owners banded together to form the Carmelo Land and Coal Company. In exchange for shares in the company, they sold their interest in the land for $1. A mine was dug into the mountain near Malpaso Creek, and the coal was transported on ore carts via a tramway to Coal Chute Point, opposite the Chinese settlement at Whaler's Cove. The deep water allowed the workers to use the chute to deliver the coal directly to coastal steamers. In 1890, Emory and Bassett's heirs subdivided Point Lobos into 1,000 parcels. They begin selling lots for $25 to $50 to a new town they initially called Point Lobos City, but later renamed Carmelito. The lack of a bridge across the Carmel River and two national economic recessions during the 1890s combined to severely restrict sales. The outer portion of the point was reserved as the Point Lobos Park. In 1897, Alexander MacMillan Allan, a successful engineer from Pennsylvania, was hired to improve the coal mine operation. When he found the coal mine could not produce a profit, he purchased of Point Lobos from the Carmelo Land and Coal Company in 1898. Marine biologist Gennosuke Kodani was already harvesting abalone from the area, a valuable delicacy in Japan. Allan partnered with him to build the Point Lobos Canning Company, which they operated until 1928. Allan decided to move the remainder of his family from Oakland to Point Lobos. Label from a can of abalone produced by the Point Lobos Canning Company in 1905. Allan added a sand and gravel mining operation to the Abalone cannery. In 1899 he had a narrow gauge railroad built from nearby San Jose Beach to Coal Chute Point to transport sand for shipment by sea to glass manufacturers in Alameda. Sand mining continued through 1954. Allan established the Point Lobos Dairy at the mouth of San Jose Creek which was operated from 1903 until 1954. He also became a successful race track architect and built the Santa Anita, Tanforan and Bay Meadows race tracks. One member of the family sold a portion they inherited to form the Carmel Meadows subdivision. = Tollgate installed = In 1899, Allan and his wife Satie, who grew to appreciate the natural beauty of the point, were concerned about the increasing number of visitors. People had been visiting the point for many years to see the rare Monterey Cypress trees and enjoy the scenic coastline. The Allan family put up toll gates, prohibited camping, and charged visitors 50 cents a vehicle (about $10 today) to enter the point. Allan bought many of the residential lots that had been subdivided and later got the entire subdivision removed from the county record. = State interest in land = Scientists reported to the government that the Carmel area including Point Lobos was the \\"most picturesque spot on the Pacific Coast.\\" In 1925, Point Lobos figured prominently in discussions for inclusion in the new state park system. Members of the Sierra Club and the Save the Redwoods League discussed preserving Point Lobos and Cypress Point as national parks or reserves. Duncan McDuffie of the Save the Redwoods League hired the internationally known landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to research Point Lobos and report on the areas most noteworthy of preservation. Olmstead's report described Point Lobos as \\"the most outstanding example on the coast of California of picturesque rock and surf scenery in combination with unique vegetation, including typical Monterey cypress.\\" Point Lobos gained the attention of the newly established California State Park system, who considered taking the land using eminent domain. Allan initially resisted the idea of making the land a public park. The family persuaded the state to wait until Allan died. = Land sold = On February 8, 1933, three years after Allan's death, the Allan family sold to the State of California for $631,000 (). The state promptly set about erasing evidence of human intrusion on the land, removing man-made structures like the abalone cannery, the railroad used to haul sand, and a number of homes and shacks, excepting a single Whalers Cabin. The Allan family donated an additional to the state of cypress-covered headlands at the western tip of the point as a memorial grove to Alexander and Satie Morgan Allan. The state added another later on, expanding the reserve to almost . = World War II use = At the beginning of World War II, a U.S. Army Coastal Defense Squad used the Whalers Cabin at Whaler's Cove for its headquarters. From 1942 to 1944, the cove was the site of a 4th Air Force Long-Range Radar site. Tents were set up to accommodate 90 men below Rat Hill. In July and August 1943, the U.S. Army established a training school for the 543rd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, 3rd Engineer Special Brigade, at Whaler's Cove at Point Lobos. The unit found that the cove was an ideal harbor for anchoring and maintaining their boats. The unit was later involved in 62 landings in the southwest Pacific. = Modern changes = The Allan family retained the land to the east of Highway 1. Eunice Allan Riley, one of Alexander's three daughters, repurchased the last subdivided lots in the 1950s. In 1960, underwater acres were added as the first marine reserve in the United States. The marine reserve was designated an ecological reserve in 1973, and in 1992, was added to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the largest in the nation.

Although the rebellion was successfully put down, his status and domain were stripped away for misruling in May 1638. After a dead peasant's body was found inside his residence, Katsuie was sent to Edo for further investigation by the government. He was beheaded in August 28, 1638, for his misruling and brutality. He was the only daimyo to be beheaded during the Edo period, rather than allowed the honourable suicide of seppuku, which suggests the severity of his misbehaviour.

Development The RWD 1 was the first aircraft constructed by the RWD team of Stanis≈Çaw Rogalski, Stanis≈Çaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki in the Aviation Section of Mechanic Students' Club of Warsaw University of Technology. It was designed in late 1927. The plane was built with a financial help of the LOPP organization. One prototype was built for static trials, and one flying prototype (registration SP-ACC), completed and flown by the designer Jerzy Drzewiecki in September 1928. Its unusual feature was a unique, fish-shaped fuselage, similar to early Messerschmitt's designs (M17). Two crewmen sat in tandem inside the fuselage and had only side openings in its upper part. In front of the pilot's head there was an upper part of the fuselage, supporting wings, limiting his view forward, though its profile was thin. This shape was repeated in following RWD designs. The aircraft was evaluated as a quite good design, with an original construction. It had high glide ratio of 12, and its payload was bigger than its empty weight. It was not built in any quantities, but gave a basis to further more successful RWD designs: RWD 2, RWD 3, RWD 4, RWD 7, and, partly RWD 5. The prototype took part in the 2nd Polish Light Aircraft Contest in 1928, but did not complete it due to engine breakdown. In 1929 it undertook a raid around Poland. It was scrapped in winter of 1929/1930. Description Wooden construction single-engine high-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout. The fuselage rectangular in cross-section, narrowing in upper part, plywood covered. Single-spar one-part trapezoid wings, covered with canvas and plywood in front. Cantilever empennage, covered with plywood (stabilizers) and canvas (rudder and elevators). The crew of two sat in tandem. The crew cockpits were open on the sides in upper part, and had individual doors (first cockpit on the right, second one on the left). A 2-cylinder air-cooled 40 hp ABC Scorpion II boxer engine (34 hp nominal power) was in front, driving two- blade wooden propeller Szoma≈Ñski (1.5 m diameter). Conventional fixed landing gear, sprung with a rubber rope, with a rear skid. Fuel tank in fuselage front (fuel consumption 9 l/h).

Glassbrenner was born in Berlin. After working for a short time in a merchant's office, he turned to journalism, and in 1831 edited Don Quixote, a periodical which was suppressed in 1833 owing to its revolutionary tendencies. He next, under the pseudonym Adolf Brennglas, published a series of pictures of Berlin life, under the titles Berlin wie es ist und trinkt (thirty parts, with illustrations, 1833‚Äì1849), and Buntes Berlin (fourteen parts, with illustrations, Berlin, 1837‚Äì1858), and thus became the founder of a popular satirical literature associated with modern Berlin. In 1840 he married the actress Adele Peroni (1813‚Äì1895), and removed in the following year to Neustrelitz, where his wife had obtained an engagement at the Grand Ducal theatre. In 1848 Glassbrenner entered the political arena and became the leader of the democratic party in Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Expelled from that country in 1850, he settled in Hamburg, where he remained until 1858; and then he became editor of the Montagszeitung Berlin, where he died in 1876. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. Among Glassbrenner's other humorous and satirical writings may be mentioned: * Leben und Treiben der feinen Welt (1834) * Bilder und Tr√§ume aus Wien (2 vols., 1836) * Gedichte (1851, 5th ed. 1870) * Neuer Reineke Fuchs (1846, 4th ed. 1870) * Die verkehrte Welt (1857, 6th ed. 1873) * Kaspar der Mensch (1850) * Berliner Volksleben (3 vols., illustrated; Leipzig, 1847-1851) * Lachende Kinder (14th ed., 1884) * Sprechende Tiere (20th ed., Hamburg, 1899).

Metro-2 () is the informal name for a purported secret underground metro system which parallels the public Moscow Metro (known as Metro-1 when in comparison with Metro-2). The system was supposedly built, or at least started, during the time of Joseph Stalin and was codenamed D-6 (–î-6) by the KGB. It is supposedly still operated by the Main Directorate of Special Programmes and Ministry of Defence.{{cite weburl=http://gusp.gov.ru title=–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏ lines, and to lie 50‚Äì200 meters (165-660 ft) deep. It is said to connect the Kremlin with the Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters, the government airport at Vnukovo-2, and an underground town at Ramenki, in addition to other locations of national importance. In 1994, the leader of an urban exploration group, the Diggers of the Underground Planet, claimed to have found an entrance to this underground system. Origin of the term Metro-1 from Metro-2, actually a switch at Troparovo to a buffer stop, on Metro-1. In the summer of 1992, the literary and journalistic magazine Yunost ('–Æ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å') published a novel by the author and screenwriter Vladimir Gonik entitled Preispodniaia ('–ü—Ä–µ–∏—Å–ø–æ–¥–Ω—è—è') (English: Abyss), set in an underground bunker in Moscow. Earlier, in the spring of that year, excerpts from the novel had been published in the weekly newspaper Sovershenno sekretno (ru). In an interview with both the newspaper's editor and Gonik in 1993, the author stated that the term \\"Metro-2\\" had been introduced to them, and that the novel had been written based on information collected over the previous 20 years by the two of them on things such as secret bunkers and the underground railways connecting them. Gonik admitted that he had worked on the book between 1973 and 1986, and that some of the more sensitive information had been purposefully misrepresented. In later years, Gonik has argued that the bunkers, and therefore the so-called \\"Metro-2\\", had been for use by the leadership of the Politburo and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), along with their families, in case of war. According to him, in the early 1970s the General Secretary of the CPSU, Leonid Brezhnev, personally visited the main bunker, and, in 1974, awarded the Chairman of the KGB at the time, Yuri Andropov, the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of Socialist Labour. Apparently, each member of the Central Committee had a apartment, with a study, lounge, kitchen and bathroom. Gonik claims to have gathered this information working as a doctor in the polyclinic of the Ministry of Defence. After the publication of the novel in 1992, the subject of a second, secret, underground railway has been raised many times, especially in the Russian media. In particular, the magazine Ogoniok has referred to a \\"Metro-2\\" several times. Confirmed information An underground service platform that is supposedly part of Metro-2 Russian journalists have reported that the existence of Metro-2 is neither confirmed nor denied by the FSB or the Moscow Metro administration. However, listed below is evidence for the Metro-2's existence. =Report from the U.S. Department of Defense= In 1991, the United States Department of Defense published a report entitled Military forces in transition, which devoted several pages to a secret government underground in Moscow. It also included a diagram of the system superimposed on a map of the city. > \\"The Soviets have constructed deep-underground both in urban Moscow and > outside the city. These facilities are interconnected by a network of deep > interconnected subway lines that provide a quick and secure means of > evacuation for the leadership.

According to Malashenko, the equipment was unusable due to age. He went on to say that the same fate befell many of the underground bomb shelters, and in particular a system of underground bunkers beneath the building of Moscow State University, which he said were flooded and had deteriorated. Vladimir Shevchenko In 2004, former advisor of Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Boris Yeltsin and then president Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Shevchenko (ru) confirmed the existence of a secret in the Moscow Metro. > \\"Reports on the number of underground communications are greatly > exaggerated.

I > will not deny anything. I would be surprised if they did not exist. You ask: > Can we use them to transport passengers?

Museum of the Cold War In 2006, the Museum of the Cold War (ru) was opened to the public, located in the old Tagansky Protected Command Point at a depth of . Initially it was a defence bunker (GO-42 or RFQ \\"Tagan\\").Underground Soviet shelters and the secret Metro-2, December 26 2013 Greorgy Manaev RBTH Its depth is significantly higher than that purported of the Metro-2 lines, and so it could not have been part of the Metro-2 system. \\"Underground City\\" in Ramenki In south-west Moscow, near the Ramenki District, there is a vacant lot to the south-west of the main building of Moscow State University. A complex of buildings of the research base of Association \\"Science\\" (NEBO \\"Nauka\\"), built to a depth of between and 200 m, is the largest underground bunker in Moscow. According to the same source, it is connected with other secret underground facilities, and appears to be able to house up to 15,000 people. A complex of surface buildings was built by architect Eugene Rozanov in 1975 by orders of Glavspetsstroy. One of the first times the facility was mentioned was in Time in 1992. Its article refers to a journalist named \\"KGB officer\\", who claims he took part in the construction of a large underground facility in Ramenki. It was claimed construction began in the mid-1960s and was complete by mid-1970. The facility was named by the journalist as the \\"Underground City\\", which was supposedly intended to give refuge to 15,000 people for 30 years in the event of a nuclear attack on Moscow. In the media, the \\"Underground City\\" is often referred to as \\"Ramenki-43\\", due to that being the address of one of the supposed entrances to the facility. Ostensibly, the address is home to Militarized Rescue Squad 21 and the 1st Paramilitary Rescue Squad. The video game Metro 2033 features the underground city and secret metro.

He is best known for his role as Tarzan in the 1960s trilogy. Football career Michael Henry's football career as a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers (1958‚Äì1961) and the Los Angeles Rams (1962‚Äì1964) led him to be noticed by Warner Bros. Acting career Henry's most prominent role was as Tarzan in three 1960s movies Tarzan and the Valley of Gold (1966), Tarzan and the Great River (1967), and Tarzan and the Jungle Boy (1968) that were all filmed back-to-back in 1965. At the time, critics said the dark-haired, square-jawed, muscular Henry resembled classic illustrations of the apeman more than any other actor who had taken on the role. Henry turned down the lead of the subsequent Tarzan television series, which then went to Ron Ely. Henry is probably best known to movie audiences for playing Jackie Gleason's character's dim-witted son \\"Junior\\" in the highly popular Smokey and the Bandit comedies, starring Burt Reynolds and Sally Field. Henry portrayed a corrupt prison guard in The Longest Yard (1974). Henry played Sergeant Kowalski in The Green Berets (1968), Luke Santee in More Dead Than Alive (1968), and corrupt Sheriff \\"Blue Tom\\" Hendricks in Rio Lobo (1970). He also acted with Charlton Heston in three films: the football movie Number One (1969), Skyjacked (1972), and Soylent Green (1973). Henry played Lt. Col. Donald Penobscot in an episode of the television series M*A*S*H. In another football-oriented role, he portrayed Tatashore, one of the members of the gang who kidnap Larry Bronco (Larry Csonka) in the \\"One of Our Running Backs Is Missing\\" episode of The Six Million Dollar Man. After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he retired from acting in 1988.

He also worked several dates for Scott D'Amore's Border City Wrestling promotion in Windsor, Ontario, using the name \\"Lucifer Love\\" (as AWF employees were not allowed to work for regional competitors, Cvjetkovich used a different ring name and gimmick so he would not be found out). In May and June 2001, Cvjetkovich toured England with Brian Dixon's All Star Wrestling promotion, where he teamed with fellow Canadian Joe E. Legend defeating top stars Tatanka, Joe Gomez, and Jake Roberts. Shortly after returning from England, Cvjetkovich began working for Northern Championship Wrestling in Montreal.

Debuting for WWE's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling in December 2006, Cvjetkovich wrestled a number of matches which continued into the summer of 2007, at the suggestion of Al Snow, in hopes of earning a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. Cvjetkovich was signed to a WWE developmental contract on July 12, 2007. With WWE starting to shift its developmental territory to the newly formed Florida Championship Wrestling, Cvjetkovich reported there instead of OVW. On October 13, 2007, Cvjetkovich made his Florida Championship Wrestling debut under the name Sinn Bowdee, losing to Mariousz Jablonski. While in FCW, Cvjetkovich wrestled and feuded with several wrestlers that later achieved success in WWE such as Evan Bourne, Jack Swagger, Justin Gabriel, Kofi Kingston and Sheamus to name only a few. Bodhi continued to wrestle in FCW even after his debut on the main roster. On the October 10, 2008 edition of SmackDown, vignettes promoting the debut of Cvjetkovich, now under the ring name Kizarny, began to air. He later described his character as being as \\"if Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts and Doink produced a lovechild.\\" During the vignettes, he spoke in carny talk, with additional vignettes airing during the next few weeks. He also competed in dark matches before SmackDown tapings, defeating Ryan Braddock and Curt Hawkins.

Cvjetkovich worked the appearance under a cloak and never revealed his true identity. During his second appearance at Chikara's season nine finale Reality is Relative on December 12, 2010, Cvjetkovich revealed his identity as Sinn Bodhi and demanded that UltraMantis Black hand him the Eye of Tyr. When UltraMantis was unable to produce the artifact, Bodhi led Obariyon, Kodama and a third masked man, who was later named Kobald, into an attack on UltraMantis, who was then saved by Hallowicked and Frightmare. UltraMantis later revealed that he had asked for Bodhi's help in training Obariyon, Kodama and Kobald for his battle against BDK, but never agreed to give him the Eye of Tyr. On January 23, 2011, at the season ten premiere, Bodhi wrestled his first Chikara match, losing to UltraMantis Black via disqualification, following interference from Kodama and Obariyon. On March 13 Bodhi defeated UltraMantis in a rematch. On April 15, Bodhi, Kodama and Obariyon entered the 2011 King of Trios, but were eliminated from the tournament in the first round by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). Bodhi was also involved in controversy at KOT due to comments he made during the pre-show which some took to be related to the recent death of Larry Sweeney. Bodhi later apologized for the promo. On September 18, Bodhi and his Dark Army (Kobald, Kodama and Obariyon) faced UltraMantis Black and his Spectral Envoy (Crossbones, Frightmare and Hallowicked) in an eight-man tag team match, which ended with UltraMantis pinning Bodhi for the win. Bodhi's feud with UltraMantis Black came to an end at the High Noon pay-per- view, where UltraMantis handed him the Eye of Tyr (which was later revealed to be a fake replica) and resulted in Bodhi proclaiming that he was now done with Chikara. In the wake of Chikara's destruction at Aniversario: Never Compromise, Sinn Bohdi and the Odditorium returned to destroy satellite promotion Wrestling is Art His group later joined with the Flood, an army of former Chikara rudos, to crush Chikara's final remnants at National Pro Wrestling Day 2014, only to be fought off.

Around 1905 he relocated to Southern California, eager to escape the \\"wild west\\" environment still present in Arizona while raising two daughters. There he became an active participant in the Pasadena, California business community, especially in the acquisition of citrus and other agricultural crops. Around this time he also became active in the establishment of the first California council of the Boy Scouts of America. He also donated $12,500 to Polytechnic School in 1907 to found the school. By the 1920s he had built up a considerable fortune, owned one of the largest lemon groves in the state, and served as the director of numerous banks, trusts companies, and corporations. While working in Pasadena he became acquainted with the biologist and eugenicist Paul B. Popenoe, and in 1925 Gosney financed Popenoe's collection of data on the implementation of California's eugenic compulsory sterilization laws. At the time, compulsory sterilization was seen by many as a way to reduce the incidence of mental illness and mental retardation in the population over time. Many states had legislation requiring the sterilization of patients at state-run psychiatric facilities, though only California executed the laws in earnest, as most other state officials were wary about the legal status of compulsory sterilization legislation. The result of Gosney and Popenoe's research was a co-authored volume, Sterilization for Human Betterment: A Summary of Results of 6,000 Operations in California, 1909‚Äì1929, completed and published in 1929. The book sought to argue that eugenic sterilization was scientifically supported, caused no harm to patients, and was legally sound. The book, distributed widely by Gosney, was used to promote compulsory sterilization legislation in other states and countries, and along with work by Harry H. Laughlin was one of the most influential texts on sterilization in the United States. Gosney and Popenoe's book was specifically referenced by officials in Nazi Germany in the creation of their own sterilization legislation in 1933 as having provided them with proof that sterilization programs could be safe and effective. According to a U.S. health official at the time who had just returned from a trip to Germany, \\"the leaders in the German sterilization movement state repeatedly that their legislation was formulated only after careful study of the California experiment.\\" (quoted in K√ºhl 1994, p. 42-43) Gosney and Popenoe believed the population of mentally ill in the United States could be reduced by half in \\"three or four generations.\\" The Sacramento philanthropist/eugenicist Charles Goethe wrote to Gosney in a letter from 1934: :You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind Hitler in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought and particularly by the work of the Human Betterment Foundation. I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people. (quoted in Black 2003) A follow-up study, Twenty-eight Years of Sterilization in California was published by the pair in 1938 (the American Journal of Sociology reviewed it with a single sentence: \\"An awkward attempt to popularize the practice of sterilizing defectives\\"). The state of California would eventually sterilize over 20,000 patients in state-run hospitals under its eugenic laws; Nazi Germany would sterilize over 400,000. In 1926, Gosney first began to organize what would by 1928 become chartered as the Human Betterment Foundation as a philanthropic foundation to promote research and advocacy of eugenics, especially by means of sterilization. As Gosney put it, the Foundation would work for: :the advancement and betterment of human life, character, and citizenship, particularly in the United States of America, in such manner as shall make for human progress in life. It is not the primary intention of to engage in the care of the unfortunate or in any form of relief work, but rather to foster and aid constructive and educational efforts for the protection and betterment of human family in body, mind, character, and citizenship in life. (Gosney and Popenoe 1929, p.192) The initial board of trustees was Gosney, Henry M. Robinson (a Los Angeles banker), George Dock (a Pasadena physician), David Starr Jordan (chancellor of Stanford University), Justin Miller (dean of the college of law at the University of Southern California), Otis Castle (a Los Angeles attorney), Joe G. Crick (a Pasadena horticulturist), Goethe, and Popenoe. Later members included Lewis Terman (a Stanford psychologist best known for creating the Stanford-Binet test of IQ), William B. Munro (a Harvard professor of political science), and University of California, Berkeley professors Herbert M. Evans (anatomy) and Samuel J. Holmes (zoology). The Foundation also established links with the California Institute of Technology, with Nobel Prize-winning Caltech physicist Robert Millikan joining the board of the HBF in 1937. The Foundation published a number of pamphlets and financed continued studies of the California sterilization program through the 1930s, and sent thousands of letters to teachers, libraries, and physicians advocating eugenic sterilization. It also underwrote a column in the Los Angeles Times on \\"social eugenics\\" and financed a radio program as well as hundreds of popular lectures around the country. Along with the American Eugenics Society, it was the most active and influential eugenics advocacy group in the country. Upon Gosney's death in 1942, his daughter liquidated the Foundation and donated its remaining assets to Caltech, which in 1943 established a Gosney research fund for biological research using the money. The archives of the Human Betterment Foundation are in Special Collections at Caltech in Pasadena.

IRC is particularly popular among programmers, hackers, and computer gamers. Overview Internet Relay Chat is an Internet-based chat system that has existed in one form or another since 1988. Networks are connected groups of IRC servers which share a common userbase. Channels are the \\"chat rooms\\" on said networks. IRC channel operators (commonly referred to as chops or chanops) are the individuals who run any given channel. While there are many different IRC networks, and across those networks there are usually large numbers of IRC channels, there are some unifying features common to the social structures of them all. Many of the features of the IRC subculture mesh with other Internet subcultures, such as various forum subcultures. This is especially prevalent in IRC channels or networks that are directly related to other Internet phenomena, such as an IRC channel created by and for the users of a particular Internet forum. Communication on IRC IRC has much in common with a regular in-person conversation. It is real-time many-on-many communication that is not logged by the server for posterity (many IRC clients do offer a logging feature, but the logs aren't generally publicly available then). Some bots may also feature logging facilities. Users on IRC usually identify users as ones \\"saying\\" something (instead of posting it) to reflect the similarity with face-to-face communication. Because IRC is a text-based communication medium, the obvious limitation of this metaphor is that the participants of a conversation on IRC do not actually see or hear each other, so alternative ways must be employed to convey the information that would otherwise be gained from facial expressions, tones of voice, and other audio-visual clues. It is common practice among IRC users to use emoticons, pseudo-XML tags (for example ...) or actions (such as *smile* or *grin*) to achieve this. Other notations common to text only media are common on IRC, such as using asterisks around *words or phrases to be emphasized*, /using slashes around words or phrases/ to simulate italics, and imparting PARTICULAR EMPHASIS to something by writing it in all capitals. Some clients also respond to \\"percent notations,\\" such as pairs of %B around bold text, %I surrounding italicized text, or %C to change the text color. In these cases, a graphical environment may be required (as text terminals typically don't have such rendering capabilities as italics and color). Orthographical and grammatical mistakes are generally not frowned upon as much on IRC as they are in other kinds of Internet forums, given the informal and temporary nature of them. If the conversation is going at a decent speed, it is not practical to correct every typo. It is similar to many instant messaging networks. Social structure Often users will visit the same channel regularly and form strong emotional ties to the other regulars of that channel. Having certain privileges on IRC is often considered a status symbol. The server administrators (those with administrative access to the IRC servers) and the IRC operators appointed by them thus have the highest status. Within the individual channels the channel operators then have a higher status than the regular users. Sometimes it is channel policy to \\"voice\\" users (add to the user's mode) in order to denote them as helpers or channel regulars, even though the channel is not in moderated mode. On many networks a channel service keeps a record of levels that operators on a given channel have, which imposes an even more differentiated structure. In certain cases, being given operator status on a channel, or being promoted to a higher level operator, is considered a social reward rather than for intent of functioning as a more privileged user. Being kicked (forcibly parted) or even banned from a channel is considered punishment. Kicks are a less serious punishment, and many clients have an auto-rejoin on kick feature. Variations While many aspects of IRC subculture are common across the entire community, many aspects are specific to particular networks, channels, or groups of channels. =Specific networks= Some networks have specific sets of etiquette, guidelines and quirks that vary from those of other networks. For example, atopical channels on general networks like EFnet tend to haze their new users more aggressively than topical channels on networks like freenode. =Specific channels= Some channels have specific sets of etiquette and guidelines that vary from those of other channels.

United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner directed the Bureau be combined with the Financial Management Service into the single Bureau of the Fiscal Service in 2012. Under authority derived from Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the Bureau of Public Debt was responsible for borrowing the money needed to operate the federal government, and is where donations to reduce the debt were made. It also accounted for the resulting debt and more recently, provides administrative and IT services to federal agencies. Principal operations were conducted in Washington, D.C. and Parkersburg, West Virginia. Additionally, Federal Reserve Banks, acting as Treasury's fiscal agents, operate critical systems in support of Public Debt Programs and perform a variety of processing and customer service functions in marketable and savings securities. The Bureau also provides reimbursable administrative and information technology services to other government agencies through the Administrative Resource Center (ARC). Public Debt fulfills its mission through five different programs: Wholesale Securities Services, Government Agency Investment Services, Retail Securities Services, Summary Debt Accounting, and Franchise Services.  History  While the public debt of the United States can be traced to the beginning of the nation itself in 1776, Public Debt, as it's known today, was officially created in 1940. The United States' government creates financial budgets through three methods: by printing money, collecting taxes, and by borrowing. The printing of money is costly and the introduction of money in the nation can create issues of inflation. Taxing the people requires the ability to incur the additional costs of their personal incomes to give to the urgent need of the debt. Borrowing is necessary to be able to finance deficits at times from those who can afford to supplement the debt in the belief that upon a time of surplus the debts would be paid back to those indebted to by the borrowers. Today, the Bureau of Public also make insurances and issues securities through the market.Cantor, Jefferey A. & Donald R. Stabile. A History of the Bureau of the Public Debt: 50th Anniversary. CH Associates. Danbury, Connecticut. 6 February 1989. pp. 261. The creation was part of a Treasury reorganization plan where the Public Debt Service was officially designated the Bureau of the Public Debt. Public Debt has had a presence in Parkersburg, WV since 1954, when the city was designated a relocation site for Public Debt in the event of a national emergency. In 1957, Parkersburg became the electronic processing center for savings bonds, and from 1993 to 1996, Public Debt consolidated and transferred the majority of its operations to Parkersburg. Today, over 95% of Public Debt employees work in Parkersburg. In October 2012, the Bureau of the Public Debt consolidated with the Financial Management Service to form the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.  Organizational structure  697px  Programs  Parkersburg. = Wholesale Securities Services = The Wholesale Securities Services program ensures the government's critical financing needs are met and administers Treasury's auction rules and government securities market regulations. Wholesale Securities Services is responsible for the sale and issuance of trillions of dollars in securities each year, and the operation of Treasury and Federal Reserve systems that support the issuance and redemption of Treasury securities. Another responsibility of the program is identifying which securities can be pledged to the government for collateral and determining how these securities are valued. This process ensures that both government funds on deposit at commercial banks and private-sector contracts with the government are secured. The Wholesale Securities Services program contributes to Treasury's priority of financing the debt at the lowest cost over time by guaranteeing operational readiness to meet the government's financing needs and protecting and strengthening Treasury's borrowing capabilities. It also educates and builds relationships with large investors and preserves confidence in Treasury auctions through the auction rule compliance program. = Government Agency Investment Services = The Government Agency Investment Services program is made up of three components: Federal Investments, Special Purpose Securities, and Federal Borrowings. The program offers specialized investments for government entities at the federal, state, and local levels. * The Federal Investments area issues, services, and redeems Government Account Series securities for federal agencies. The Federal Investments component handles the accounting and reporting on all receipts and disbursements for the 18 trust funds (such as Inland Waterways Trust Fund, Highway Trust Fund and Unemployment Fund) managed by the Treasury Department. * The Special Purpose Securities area issues, services and redeems special purpose securities, as well as serves as a fiscal agent for securities issued by other federal agencies. The State and Local Government Series (SLGS) is the largest of these securities. SLGS offer flexible investment alternatives for state and local governments to refinance outstanding, tax-exempt debt. * The Federal Borrowings area manages direct loans and loan guarantees to federal agencies operating loan programs. These loan programs support education, housing, veterans and small businesses. The Federal Borrowings area is also responsible for the accounting and reporting of all principal and interest amounts. = Retail Securities Services = The Retail Securities Services program serves millions of Treasury securities investors. Specifically, the program is responsible for the issuance, servicing and redemption of U.S. Savings Bonds and marketable Treasury securities. Additionally, the TreasuryDirect and Legacy Treasury Direct holding systems fall under the Retail Securities Services program. Legacy Treasury Direct and TreasuryDirect systems allow individuals and institutions set up accounts to purchase Treasury securities and hold them directly with Treasury, rather than with a financial institution. The program currently is focused on supporting Treasury's goal of effectively managing government finances by positioning Treasury to eliminate new issues of paper savings bonds and improving service quality and efficiency for customers. = Summary Debt Accounting = The Summary Debt Accounting program is responsible for accounting for the public debt of the United States and related interest expenses. The program controls and reconciles Treasury securities transactions and related cash flows. These cash flows represent funds received from the sale of securities and funds disbursed as interest and principal payments. Summary Debt Accounting also produces and publishes data and reports on the composition of the public debt as well as the balance of the debt to the penny. The program is focused on improving the clarity, usefulness and availability of federal debt information. = Franchise Services = Public Debt's Administrative Resource Center (ARC) provides reimbursable financial, administrative and IT services to a wide variety of federal agencies. Administrative services include financial accounting, travel and relocation services, human resources, procurement, and investment services. Information technology services include application development and hosting, website development, Internet services, network maintenance, security consulting, and encryption services. ARC was selected by the Office of Management and Budget as a Shared Service Provider for Financial Management as well as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) services, and as a Shared Service Center to perform Certification & Accreditation (C&A;) through the Information Systems Security Line of Business (ISSLOB). ARC allows customers to focus on their missions, not support functions; lowers customer administrative service costs; improves data quality through standardization; and strengthens controls and ensures audit compliance. = Do Not Pay Business Center = As of June 18, 2010, the Bureau of Public Debt assists other government agencies in the reduction and prevention of improper payments by federally funded programs being issued. With the establishment of a single point of entry for these government funded paying agencies, determining eligibility for a grant, benefit, or contract award can be done. As a result of this streamlining improper payments will no longer occur or be avoided completely. Funds will not go to the wrong recipient or be used by a recipient in an improper manner, recipients will not receive the incorrect amount of funds (including overpayments and underpayments), and documentation will be available to support a payment that should occur and will not be available to payments that should not occur.

(July 13, 1883‚ÄîDecember 21, 1938) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1932 to 1938, representing the Independent Labour Party. Biography Hyman was born to a Jewish family near Vilna, Poland. His father, the Rabbi Aaron Hyman, was the author of several works. The younger Hyman was educated at Worcester College, Oxford, and received five scholarships during his time in England. From 1910 to 1913, he worked as the private tutor to an India prince. He came to Canada in 1913, and worked as a barrister-at-law, also lecturing at the Manitoba Law School from 1915 to 1921 in international law and legal history. In 1914, he married Erna Ziembiska. During World War I, Hyman was president of the Western Canadian Relief Fund for the Relief of War Sufferers and, in 1917-18, chair of the Winnipeg Committee of the British and Canadian Recruiting Mission. The letter organization helped to raise men for combat in Egypt and Palestine. From 1923 to 1928, he was a member of the Winnipeg School Board. Hyman's political career effectively began with the Winnipeg General Strike. He acted as defense council for the strikers, and defended a number of east European strikers accused of \\"foreign agitation\\". He continued his practice as a labour lawyer in the 1920s, and was a supporter of the One Big Union. He first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1927 provincial election, but finished third in Manitoba riding. He ran for Mayor of Winnipeg in 1930 and 1931, but lost on both occasions. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1932 election, running as a candidate in the Winnipeg constituency. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members by preferential balloting. Hyman finished ninth on the first count, and was subsequently declared elected. He served with his ILP colleagues on the opposition benches throughout his time in the legislature. His re-election in the 1936 election was not guaranteed, as the ILP faced strong opposition from the Communist Party and independent leftist Lewis Stubbs. Hyman again finished ninth on the first count, but had to wait for the sixteenth count to be confirmed as successful. Hyman was one of the most respected members of the legislature, and spoke on subjects such as education, civil liberties and labour legislation. He was an early supporter of larger school units for the province, considering the local units to be ineffective. Hyman also endorsed the creation of Riding Mountain National Park. He is remembered particularly for having co-sponsored the province's Anti-Defamation Bill, which allowed members of a racial or religious group to sue for an injunction against a defaming publisher or author. Known as the \\"Hyman Act\\", this bill was supported the John Bracken government and given unanimous passage in 1934. He died in Winnipeg in 1938, while still a member of the legislature. Legacy The University of Manitoba offers a Marcus Hyman Memorial Scholarship. One past winner of the scholarship was Larry Zolf.

It is managed by Great Western Railway, the seventh company to be responsible for the station, and the third franchise since privatisation in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, the standard service being a train every 40 minutes along the Severn Beach Line, an hourly service to , and another hourly service to . The station was opened in 1863 by the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, with a single track and platform. The line was doubled in 1874 when the Clifton Extension Railway opened, then expanded to four tracks and platforms in 1888. There were buildings on all platforms and a goods yard to the north. Stapleton Road became one of Bristol's busiest stations, but service levels reduced significantly in the 1960s when reversing trains at Bristol Temple Meads became common. The goods facilities were closed in 1965, staff were withdrawn in 1967 and the line was reduced to two tracks in 1984. In 2018, two additional running lines were added to increase capacity as part of the 21st- century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line. The line was also due to be electrified, but this has now been deferred until the next control period, which runs from 2019 to 2024.https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the- railway/our-routes/western/great-western-mainline/bristol-upgrades/city-of- bristol/ Description The Eastside Roots community garden project was in the station's disused eastern trackbed. Stapleton Road railway station is in the Easton area of Bristol. The surrounding area is primarily residential, with the M32 motorway to the north of the station, and an industrial and commercial area north of that. The station is named after the A432 Stapleton Road just north of the station. The station can be accessed by Belmont Street to the west, an unnamed access road to the east, or by a set of steps from Stapleton Road. Access to the southbound platform is via a slope of gradient greater than 1 in 12. The station is on the Cross Country Route between and , and on the Severn Beach Line from Bristol Temple Meads to . It is from Bristol Temple Meads.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. Directly to the north of the station is a bridge over the A432, then a bridge over the M32, then Narroways Hill Junction, where the Severn Beach Line diverges from the Cross Country Route. The next station north along the Cross Country Route is , the next station north along the Severn Beach Line is , and the next station south is . The station is on an alignment of 150 degrees, curving towards the east. There are two active platforms: the western platform, platform 1, serves northbound trains; the eastern platform, platform 2, serves southbound trains. Platform 1 is in length, and platform 2 , but both have the southern fenced off. The southern end of the platforms bridge the residential street St Mark's Road. Platform 2 is part of an \\"island\\" platform, the other face of which served the northbound \\"up fast\\" line through the station, which was removed in 1984 along with the southbound \\"down fast\\" and fourth platform which served it. Access between the platforms is via an open, stepped footbridge. , facilities at the station are minimal ‚Äì there is a metal and glass shelter and a row of seats on the northbound platform. The station is completely unstaffed, and there are no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms. There is no car park or taxi rank, and the nearest bus stop is away on the A432 Stapleton Road. There are eight bicycle stands on the platform. A mural depicting local life and history is painted on the wall of platform 1. The line through Stapleton Road has a speed limit of northbound and southbound. The loading gauge is W8, and the line handles over 15 million train tonnes per year. Services Great Western Railway. A Express Sprinter DMU stands with a service for . Services at Stapleton Road are operated by Great Western Railway. , Monday to Friday, three trains every two hours run along the Severn Beach Line from to via , with one extended to and . Most services start at Bristol, but one evening service to Avonmouth begins at . On Saturdays there is a similar level of service, but more trains continue to Severn Beach. Sunday sees a roughly hourly service to and from Bristol, with only two services extending to Severn Beach, except during the May‚ÄìSeptember timetable period, when all services are extended. The first and last Sunday trains towards Bristol are extended to via , and there are similar workings in the other direction. Most trains call at all stations, but some services omit . Southbound services from and to and call at Stapleton road, with one train per hour. Hourly northbound services from to also call, as do some peak northbound services from to and two evening southbound services from Cardiff to Bristol. All trains southbound call at Bristol Temple Meads, although this requires Gloucester-Westbury trains to reverse. CrossCountry trains pass Stapleton Road non-stop throughout the day, operating two trains per hour each direction between the South West, Bristol, Manchester and Scotland. Services from Stapleton Road are operated using a mix of Sprinter, Super Sprinter, Express Sprinter and Turbo diesel multiple units. Until 2012, Pacer units were a regular sight, but these have mostly been moved south to work in Devon and Cornwall following a cascade of Class 150/1 units from London Midland and London Overground. The standard journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is 7 minutes, to Bristol Parkway 13 minutes, and to Avonmouth 23 minutes. History A southbound parcels train passes through Stapleton Road in 1958 Stapleton Road opened on 8 September 1863 when services began on the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (BSWUR), which ran from to , north of Bristol on the banks of the River Severn. At New Passage, passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross the Severn to continue on into Wales. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as single-track broad gauge, with a platform on the west side of the track. The BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway, which had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services, in 1868; and in 1873 the line was converted to standard gauge. In 1874, the Clifton Extension Railway opened, connecting the Bristol Port Railway and Pier to the Great Western Railway at Narroways Hill Junction, north of Stapleton Road. To cope with the expected increase in traffic, the line was doubled, and a second platform was added to the east of the two tracks. Two more tracks were added in 1888, giving a layout of two sets of two tracks, with platforms on the outside and on an island in the middle. Trains to and from and used the western platforms while trains to and from South Wales used the eastern platforms. There were buildings on all the platforms, with the booking office on the eastern outer platform, at the head of the access road. The refreshment room was on the island platform, and a covered footbridge connected the platforms. There was a yard to the north of the station, on the other side of Stapleton Road, which handled goods traffic including coal and other minerals. Stapleton Road railway station in 1972, showing the station with four platforms Stapleton Road became one of Bristol's busiest stations. The opening of the Clifton Extension Railway meant that Stapleton Road became a junction station, and when the Severn Tunnel was opened in 1886, replacing the ferry from New Passage, trains from London to Wales began to run via Bristol instead of . Many would call at Stapleton Road instead of Bristol Temple Meads because this avoided having to run the locomotive around the train. In 1886, the daily Great Western service along the Clifton Extension Railway was 6 trains each way between Avonmouth and Temple Meads, 24 trains from Clifton Down to Temple Meads and 26 the other direction. By 1910 there were 17 services daily from Avonmouth to Temple Meads and 15 the other way, a further 20 trains each day operating between Clifton Down and Temple Meads. For many passengers on the Clifton Extension Railway, Stapleton Road was where they would change for services to South Wales and the South Coast of England, and by 1912 the station name boards showed \\"Stapleton Road Junction for Clifton and Avonmouth\\", although the station was never officially renamed. But by this time the number of services to Wales had decreased owing to the opening of the \\"Badminton Line\\" from Wootton Bassett to , now part of the South Wales Main Line, which allowed trains from London to avoid central Bristol entirely. From 1924, many trains to Avonmouth were extended to , a growing seaside resort, and some on to , then back to Temple Meads via . Circular trips via were also common, and by 1930 a total of 350 trains would pass the station each day. The station was also used by excursion trains, and by trains of evacuees during the Second World War. By 1947, just before the start of the British Rail era, there were 33 daily services each direction between Avonmouth and Temple Meads, and 18 on Sundays. The station also saw the arrival of Prime Minister David Lloyd George in the 1920s. A goods train passes through Stapleton Road on the eastern \\"fast\\" line in 1981. The two tracks here would be removed in 1984, leaving only two tracks through the station. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, Stapleton Road came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. A gradual decline of services at Stapleton Road began. While as late as 1963 name boards at the station read \\"Bristol Stapleton Road\\", trains between South Wales and the South Coast were eventually re-routed via Bristol Temple Meads ‚Äì the introduction of diesel multiple units making it easier for the trains to reverse ‚Äì and no longer called at Stapleton Road. Passenger numbers along the Clifton Extension Railway, now known as the Severn Beach Line, also dropped, and in 1963 the Beeching report suggested that all services along the line be withdrawn. In the end, services continued to Severn Beach but were discontinued via Henbury and Pilning. The goods yard was closed on 29 November 1965, and staff were withdrawn from the station from 17 July 1967 as a cost- saving measure. In 1975 the M32 motorway was opened north of the station, passing through the southern end of the goods yard. The eastern tracks were removed in 1984, although the bridge which carried the line across the A432 and M32 was left intact. The remaining station buildings were demolished at the same time, the buildings on the island platform having already been removed by 1958. Plans to use the disused trackbed as part of a light rail scheme linking the city centre to the northern suburbs were formed in the late 1990s, with the aim of an operational scheme by 2008, but the plans had been shelved by 2004. It was suggested in 2008 that the trackbed could be used as a cycle path to join together communities which had been separated by the construction of the M32 motorway, however this was dropped due to Network Rail asserting that the trackbed might be necessary for future rail expansion. Like many stations in Bristol, large proportions of the platforms have been fenced off as the trains which call now are shorter than those which called in the station's heyday. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. Services at Stapleton Road were boosted due to the proximity of Eastville Stadium, but this use ended in 1986 when Bristol Rovers F.C. moved to Twerton Park in Bath. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The station was brightened in 1999 when a mural illustrating local life was painted on the wall of the western platform by Bill Guilding. Services along the Severn Beach Line were increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded in 2015 as Great Western Railway. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the Severn Beach Line. Passenger traffic increased significantly, and in 2010, Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored. Pacer trains used to operate services from Stapleton Road, until being moved to Devon and Cornwall in 2012. By 2005, the disused eastern trackbed was filled with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings and the use of illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward in 2009. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy. The station entrance, including walls and gates, were decorated in 2020 by local artists. Future First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped owing to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. The line through Stapleton Road was due to have been electrified by 2017 as part of the Great Western Main Line electrification project, however this has been postponed indefinitely. The Cross Country Route, the Severn Beach Line and the Heart of Wessex Line were not set to be electrified, therefore services at Stapleton Road would still have been provided by diesel trains, although \\"Sprinter\\" units are expected to be replaced by and \\"Turbo\\" units. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing beyond the main lines, as does MP for Weston-super-Mare John Penrose. The electrification scheme also includes the four-tracking of Filton Bank, including the reinstatement of the disused trackbed at Stapleton Road, to allow more services between Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads and separate fast inter-city services from local stopping services. The two eastern platforms at Stapleton Road will be demolished to allow trains to run faster, although it has been suggested that they be kept for use in case of service disruptions. Stapleton Road is on the / corridor, one of the main axes of the Greater Bristol Metro, a rail transport plan, which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area, including half-hourly services along the Severn Beach Line. The scheme could see the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line to passengers, with the possibility of services from Bristol Temple Meads to Bristol Parkway via and . Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board, but Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion.

For a full treatment of the fictional origin of the song, \\"wholly original with Stevenson\\", see sea song,Many sources call \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" a sea chanty, however Stevenson himself never called it that, rather the novel says it's a \\"sea-song\\" and a \\"sailor's song\\". Sea-song is described in the Oxford English Dictionary as \\"A song such as is sung by sailors.\\" (sea-song, n.; Second edition, 1989). The OED defines shanty as \\"A sailor's song, esp. one sung during heavy work.\\" The OED has no entry for sailor's song. Since the terms Stevenson used are oblique, it is a matter of interpretation if Stevenson meant it to be a shanty, or not. originally from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island (1883). It was expanded in a poem, titled \\"Derelict\\" by Young E. Allison, published in the Louisville Courier-Journal in 1891. It has since been used in many later works of art in various forms. Background Stevenson found the name \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" among a list of Virgin Island names in a book by Charles Kingsley, possibly in reference to the Dead Chest Island off Peter Island in the British Virgin Islands. Note: Hersey incorrectly says Stevenson derived the song from Billy Bones's Fancy, rather Billy Bones's Fancy is derived from Stevensons original chorus in Treasure Island.The relevant quote from At Last > the first of those numberless isles which Columbus, so goes the tale, > discovered on St. Ursula's day, and named them after the Saint and her > eleven thousand mythical virgins. Unfortunately, English buccaneers have > since then given to most of them less poetic names. The Dutchman's Cap, > Broken Jerusalem, The Dead Man's Chest, Rum Island, and so forth, mark a > time and a race more prosaic, but still more terrible, though not one whit > more wicked and brutal, than the Spanish Conquistadores There is also a Dead Man's Chest Island in Puerto Rico, not one of the Virgin Islands but close to them, and with the same name. As Stevenson once said, \\"Treasure Island came out of Kingsley's At Last: A Christmas in the West Indies (1871); where I got the 'Dead Man's Chest'‚Äîthat was the seed.\\" That is, Stevenson saw the three words \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" in Kingsley's book among a list of names, germinating in Stevenson's mind it was the \\"seed\\", which then grew into the novel. In Treasure Island Stevenson only wrote the chorus, leaving the remainder of the song unwritten, and to the reader's imagination: Another lyric in the novel, near its end: Stevenson does not make clear if this lyric is part of Dead Man's Chest or another fictional song entirely. Regardless, the words of the lyric help advance the storyline. Other variations of the poem were printed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that claimed to be folklore, but in reality were nothing more than new extensions from Stevenson's original. One appeared in the Chicago Times-Herald named \\"Stevenson's Sailor Song\\" by an anonymous author, who claimed to hear it being sung on the \\"wharfs of Chicago\\" by a group of \\"old time sailors\\", who when asked where they learned it, replied 'We never learned it nowhere, we allers knowed it.' The story was meant as a hoax but some took it seriously. Another appeared in print as \\"Billy Bones's Fancy\\", supposedly pieced together from various \\"fragments\\", suggesting an antiquated origin, but in fact it was an adaptation of the Times-Herald piece. As Stevenson's stepson Osbourne once said, \\"'Fifteen-Men' was wholly original with Stevenson,\\" and as Stevenson himself said, the book At Last by Kingsley was \\"the seed\\" of his invention. The song has been widely used in the arts for over a century. In 1901 music was added to the lyrics of \\"Derelict\\" by Henry Waller for a Broadway rendition of Treasure Island. In the 1954 film Return to Treasure Island, starring Robert Newton, the song was sung in the opening credits, and instrumentally as the thematic background to the action. In the 1959 television series The Adventures of Long John Silver‚Äîagain starring Robert Newton‚Äîit was, although only in instrumental version, the series' theme song played both at the beginning and the end of each episode. In 1967, writers for the Walt Disney film company found inspiration in \\"Derelict\\" for the sea-song \\"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\\", which was played in the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" theme ride at Disneyland. Astrid Lindgren expanded Stevenson's couplet differently in the script for the 1969 Pippi Longstocking TV series. Alan Moore made a play on the song in the 1986 graphic novel Watchmen; the chapter is called \\"One man on fifteen dead men's chests.\\" In 1993, the contemporary \\"pirate\\" vocal group, The Jolly Rogers, recorded Mark Stahl's arrangement of Young E. Allison's lyrics, re-released in 1997 on their CD titled \\"Pirate Gold\\". A rendition was recorded by the steampunk band Abney Park as \\"The Derelict\\". In the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, Joshamee Gibbs sang the original version from Treasure Island‚Äîa fourth wall joke, as the film was called Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. In German, the song is sometimes known as \\"17 Mann auf des toten Manns Kiste\\", so it mentions two more men, or sometimes as \\"13 Mann\\", mentioning two fewer, most prominently in Michael Ende's Jim Knopf stories. Likewise, in the Hungarian translation of Treasure Island, the phrase is \\"seven (men) on a dead man's chest\\"; apparently these numbers provided the closest effect to the original regarding rhyme and syllables in English. Many authors have written prequels and sequels to Treasure Island. One such example is R. F. Delderfield's The Adventures of Ben Gunn, in which Ben tells Jim Hawkins that the song is a reference to \\"an island of the Leewards\\" which \\"was little more than a long, high rock, shaped like a coffin\\" which was nicknamed \\"Dead Man's Chest\\". In Delderfield's story, the song is about 15 pirates who shipwrecked there who had salvaged many barrels of rum but almost no food, and were \\"all raving drunk\\" upon their rescue.

Jeff Thompson (January 22, 1826 - September 5, 1876), nicknamed \\"Swamp Fox,\\" was a senior officer of the Missouri State Guard who commanded cavalry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. The (ca. 1862) was named after him. Early life and career Meriwether Jefferson Thompson was born in Jefferson County, Virginia (present-day West Virginia),Filbert, Preston, The Half not Told; the Civil War in a Frontier Town, Stackpole Books, page 11 into a family with a strong military tradition on both sides. He received basic training in military tactics in Charleston, South Carolina, but was not appointed to a military academy. Following his education, he found employment as a store clerk in a few Virginia and Pennsylvania towns. He moved to Liberty, Missouri, in 1847 and St. Joseph the following year, beginning as a store clerk before taking up surveying and serving as the city engineer.Allardice, Bruce, More Generals in Gray, LSU Press, page 219 He later supervised the construction of the western branch of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad. He married Emma Catherine Hays in 1848. He served as the seventh Mayor of St. Joseph, Missouri from 1857‚Äì1860. He presided over the ceremony inaugurating the first ride of the Pony Express on April 3, 1860. He gained national attention in May, 1861, when he cut down a United States flag from the St. Joseph Post Office flag pole and threw it down to an angry crowd of southern sympathizers who shredded it to pieces. American Civil War Thompson in uniform, ca. 1862 Thompson was a lieutenant-colonel in the Missouri state militia at the outbreak of the Civil War. On July 25, 1861, he was appointed brigadier-general of the 1st Division, Missouri State Guard. He commanded the First Military District of Missouri, which covered the swampy southeastern quarter of the state from St. Louis to the Mississippi River. Thompson's battalion soon became known as the \\"Swamp Rats\\" for their exploits. He gained renown as the \\"Swamp Fox of the Confederacy.\\" Although Thompson frequently petitioned for the Confederate rank of brigadier-general it was never granted. His brigadier rank came from his Missouri State Guard service.Allardice, Bruce, More Generals in Gray, LSU Press, page 220 When Union Major-General John C. Fremont issued an emancipation proclamation purporting to free the slaves in Missouri, Thompson declared a counter-proclamation and his force of 3,000 soldiers began raiding Union positions near the border in October. On October 15, 1861, Thompson led a cavalry attack on the Iron Mountain Railroad bridge over the Big River near Blackwell in Jefferson County. After successfully burning the bridge, Thompson retreated to join his infantry in Fredericktown. Soon afterwards, he was defeated at the Battle of Fredericktown and withdrew, leaving southeastern Missouri in Union control. After briefly commanding rams in the Confederate riverine fleet in 1862, Thompson was reassigned to the Trans-Mississippi region. There, he engaged in a number of battles before returning to Arkansas in 1863 to accompany Gen. John S. Marmaduke on his raid into Missouri. Thompson was captured in August in Arkansas, and spent time in St. Louis' Gratiot Military Prison, as well as at the Fort Delaware and Johnson's Island prisoner-of-war camps (\\"Poor old Jeff, how my heart went out to him; he a prisoner and his devoted wife in a madhouse\\", Major Lamar Fontaine wrote later).Fontaine, Lamar. My Life and My Lectures. New York: The Neale Publishing Company, 1908, p. 238. Eventually, he was exchanged in 1864 for a Union general. Later that year, Thompson participated in Major-General Sterling Price's Missouri expedition, taking command of \\"Jo\\" Shelby's famed \\"Iron Brigade\\" when Shelby became division commander. He served competently in this role. In March 1865, Thompson was appointed commander of the Northern Sub-District of Arkansas. He agreed to surrender his command at Chalk Bluff, Arkansas on May 11, 1865, and agreed to have his men assemble at Wittsburg and Jacksonport, Arkansas to lay down their arms and receive their paroles. Thompson's command was widely dispersed throughout northeast Arkansas, more for reasons of available forage than anything else. About a third of his men refused to surrender. Shelby's Missouri Brigade, along with elements of Green's and Jackman's Missouri brigades, lit out for Mexico. Some Missouri units disbanded rather than surrender their colors. Many men simply went home.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Jacksonport 1865 surrender list?\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 1 January 2004, Accessed 1 January 2012, http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/archive_index.cgi?noframes;read=6006 While most the men on the Jacksonport parole lists actually served in the unit with which they surrendered, some men were attached themselves to various regiments solely for the purpose of surrendering. A few probably never saw any service except marching with their relatives and neighbors to Jacksonport to receive the paroles, which were thought to provide the former confederates with some degree of protection from later arrest or capture.A Brief History of the 45th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, C.S.A., by James Logan Morgan; The Stream of History, Volume 16, Part 4 (Oct. 1978).

He designed a program for improving the Louisiana swamps, a job that eventually destroyed his health. He returned to St. Joseph, Missouri in 1876 where he succumbed to tuberculosis.Filbert, Preston, The Half not Told; the Civil War in a Frontier Town, Stackpole Books, page 166 He is buried in Mount Mora Cemetery in St. Joseph, Missouri. Honors In early 1862 at New Orleans, a side-wheel river steamer was converted to a \\"Cottonclad\\" ram and named after Thompson. The CSS General M. Jeff. Thompson was sent up the Mississippi that April to join the River Defense Fleet in Tennessee waters, seeing its first action at Plum Point Bend. On June the 6th, after being set afire by gunfire at Memphis, the General M. Jeff. Thompson ran aground and soon blew up.

A similar standard is the European seasonal energy efficiency ratio (ESEER). The SEER rating of a unit is the cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. The higher the unit's SEER rating the more energy efficient it is. In the U.S., the SEER is the ratio of cooling in British thermal unit (BTU) to the energy consumed in watt-hours. The coefficient of performance (COP), a more universal unit-less measure of efficiency, is discussed in the following section. For example, consider a 5000 BTU/h (1465 watts cooling capacity) air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10 BTU/W¬∑h, operating for a total of 1000 hours during an annual cooling season (e.g., 8 hours per day for 125 days). The annual total cooling output would be: :5000 BTU/h √ó 8 h/day √ó 125 days/year = 5,000,000 BTU/year With a SEER of 10 BTU/W¬∑h, the annual electrical energy usage would be about: :5,000,000 BTU/year / 10 BTU/(W¬∑h) = 500,000 W¬∑h/year The average power usage may also be calculated more simply by: :Average power = (BTU/h) / (SEER) = 5000 / 10 = 500 W If your electricity cost is 20¬¢/kW¬∑h, then your cost per operating hour is: :0.5 kW * 20¬¢/kW¬∑h = 10¬¢/h Relationship of SEER to EER and COP The energy efficiency ratio (EER) of a particular cooling device is the ratio of output cooling energy (in BTU/hr) to input electrical energy (in Watts) at a given operating point. EER is generally calculated using a 95 ¬∞F outside temp and an inside (actually return air) temp of 80 ¬∞F and 50% relative humidity. The EER is related to the coefficient of performance (COP) commonly used in thermodynamics, with the primary difference being that the COP of a cooling device is unit-less, because the numerator and denominator are expressed in the same units. The EER uses mixed units, so it doesn't have an immediate physical sense and is obtained by multiplying the COP (or EER) by the conversion factor from BTU/h to Watts: EER = 3.41214 √ó COP (see British thermal unit). The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) is also the COP (or EER) expressed in BTU/hr/W, but instead of being evaluated at a single operating condition, it represents the expected overall performance for a typical year's weather in a given location. The SEER is thus calculated with the same indoor temperature, but over a range of outside temperatures from to , with a certain specified percentage of time in each of 8 bins spanning 5 ¬∞F (2.8 ¬∞C). There is no allowance for different climates in this rating, which is intended to give an indication of how the EER is affected by a range of outside temperatures over the course of a cooling season. Typical EER for residential central cooling units = 0.875 √ó SEER. SEER is a higher value than EER for the same equipment. A more detailed method for converting SEER to EER uses this formula: :EER = -0.02 √ó SEER¬≤ + 1.12 √ó SEER Note that this method is used for benchmark modeling only and is not appropriate for all climate conditions. A SEER of 13 is approximately equivalent to an EER of 11, and a COP of 3.2, which means that 3.2 units of heat are removed from indoors per unit of energy used to run the air conditioner. Theoretical maximum The SEER and EER of an air conditioner are limited by the laws of thermodynamics. The refrigeration process with the maximum possible efficiency is the Carnot cycle. The COP of an air conditioner using the Carnot cycle is: :COP_{Carnot}=\\\\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}-T_{C}} where T_C is the indoor temperature and T_H is the outdoor temperature. Both temperatures must be measured using a thermodynamic temperature scale based at absolute zero such as Kelvin or Rankine. The EER is calculated by multiplying the COP by 3.412 BTU/W‚ãÖh as described above: :EER_{Carnot}=3.412 \\\\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}-T_{C}} Assuming an outdoor temperature of and an indoor temperature of , the above equation gives (when temperatures are converted to Kelvin or Rankine) a COP of 36, or an EER of 120. This is about 10 times more efficient than a typical home air conditioner available today. The maximum EER decreases as the difference between the inside and outside air temperature increases, and vice versa. In a desert climate where the outdoor temperature is , the maximum COP drops to 13, or an EER of 46 (for an indoor temperature of ). The maximum SEER can be calculated by averaging the maximum EER over the range of expected temperatures for the season. US government SEER standards SEER rating reflects overall system efficiency on a seasonal basis and EER reflects the system's energy efficiency at one specific operating condition. Both ratings are useful when choosing products, but the same rating must be used for comparisons. Substantial energy savings can be obtained from more efficient systems. For example, by upgrading from SEER 9 to SEER 13, the power consumption is reduced by 30% (equal to 1 ‚àí 9/13). It is claimed that this can result in an energy savings valued at up to $300 per year depending on the usage rate and the cost of electricity. With existing units that are still functional and well-maintained, when the time value of money is considered, retaining existing units rather than proactively replacing them may be the most cost effective. However, the efficiency of air conditioners can degrade significantly over time.US Department of Energy Framework Public Meeting for Residential Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps (June 12, 2008) at 35‚Äì 36 (transcript) . But when either replacing equipment, or specifying new installations, a variety of SEERs are available. For most applications, the minimum or near-minimum SEER units are most cost effective, but the longer the cooling seasons, the higher the electricity costs, and the longer the purchasers will own the systems, the more that incrementally higher SEER units are justified. Residential split-system AC units of SEER 20 or more are now available. The higher SEER units typically have larger coils and multiple compressors, with some also having variable refrigerant flow and variable supply air flow. = 1992 = In 1987 legislation taking effect in 1992 was passed requiring a minimum SEER rating of 10.http://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-air-conditioner-efficiency- standards-seer-13-vs.-seer-12 It is rare to see systems rated below SEER 9 in the United States because aging, existing units are being replaced with new, higher efficiency units. = 2006 = Beginning in January 2006 a minimum SEER 13 was required.http://www.mikesheatingandairconditioning.com/13seermandate.htm The United States requires that residential systems manufactured after 2005 have a minimum SEER rating of 13. ENERGY STAR qualified Central Air Conditioners must have a SEER of at least 14.5. Window units are exempt from this law so their SEERs are still around 10. = 2015 = In 2011 the US Department of Energy (DOE) revised energy conservation rules to impose elevated minimum standards and regional standards for residential HVAC systems. The regional approach recognizes the differences in cost-optimization resulting from regional climate differences. For example, there is little cost benefit in having a very high SEER air conditioning unit in Maine, a state in the northeast US. Starting January 1, 2015, split-system central air conditioners installed in the Southeastern Region of the United States of America must be at least 14 SEER. The Southeastern Region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Similarly, split- system central air conditioners installed in the Southwestern Region must be a minimum 14 SEER and 12.2 EER beginning on January 1, 2015. The Southwestern Region consists of Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico. Split-system central air conditioners installed in all other states outside the Southeastern and Southwestern regions must continue to be a minimum of 13 SEER, which is the current national requirement. There have been many new advances in efficient technology over the past 10 years which have enabled manufacturers to increase their SEER ratings dramatically in order to stay above the required minimums set by the United States department of energy. Calculating the annual cost of electric energy for an air conditioner Electric power is usually measured in kilowatts (kW). Electric energy is usually measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). For example, if an electric load that draws 1.5 kW of electric power is operated for 8 hours, it uses 12 kWh of electric energy. In the United States, a residential electric customer is charged based on the amount of electric energy one uses. On the customer bill, the electric utility states the amount of electric energy, in kilowatt-hours (kWh), that the customer used since the last bill, and the cost of the energy per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Air conditioner sizes are often given as \\"tons\\" of cooling, where 1 ton of cooling equals . 1 ton of cooling equals the amount of power that needs to be applied continuously, over a 24-hour period, to melt 1 ton of ice. The annual cost of electric energy consumed by a (6 ton) air conditioning unit, operating for 1000 hours per year, with a SEER rating of 10, and an electric energy cost of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) is: : unit size, BTU/h √ó hours per year, h √ó energy cost, $/kWh √∑ SEER, BTU/Wh √∑ 1000, W/kW Example 1: : (72,000 BTU/h) √ó (1000 h/year) √ó ($0.12/kWh) √∑ (10 BTU/Wh) √∑ (1000 W/kW) = $860/year Example 2. A residence near Chicago has an air conditioner with a cooling capacity of 4 tons and an SEER rating of 10. The unit is operated 120 days each year for 8 hours per day (960 hours per year), and the electric energy cost is $0.10 per kilowatt-hour. What is the annual cost of the electric energy required to operate the air conditioner? First, we convert tons of cooling to BTU/h: : (4 tons) √ó (12,000 BTU/h/ton) = 48,000 Btu/h. The annual cost of the electric energy is: : (48,000 Btu/h) √ó (960 h/year) √ó ($0.10/kWh) √∑ (10 BTU/Wh) √∑ (1000 W/kW) = $460/year  Maximum SEER ratings  Today there are mini-split (ductless) air conditioner units available with SEER ratings up to 42. During the 2014 AHR Expo, Mitsubishi unveiled a new mini-split ductless AC unit with a SEER rating of 30.5.> GREE also released a 30.5 SEER rating mini split in 2015 as well.> Carrier launched a 42 SEER ductless air conditioner during 2018 Consumer electronic Show (CES), held in Las Vegas.https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8251451-carrier- most-efficient-air-conditioner-ces/ Carrier is part of UTC Climate, Controls & Security, a unit of United Technologies Corp. Traditional AC systems with ducts have maximum SEER ratings slightly below these levels. Also, practically, central systems will have an achieved energy efficiency ratio 10‚Äì20% lower than the nameplate rating due to the duct-related losses. Additionally, there are ground-source residential AC units with SEER ratings up to 75. However, ground source heat pump effective efficiency is reliant on the temperature of the ground or water source used. Hot climates have a much higher ground or surface water temperature than cold climates and therefore will not be able to achieve such efficiencies. Moreover, the ARI rating scheme for ground source heat pumps allows them to largely ignore required pump power in their ratings, making the achievable SEER values often practically lower than the highest efficiency air-source equipment‚Äîparticularly for air cooling. There are a variety of technologies that will allow SEER and EER ratings to increase further in the near future. Some of these technologies include rotary compressors, inverters, DC brushless motors, variable-speed drives and integrated systems.  Heat pumps  A refrigeration cycle can be operated as a heat pump to move heat from outdoors into a warmer house. A heat pump with a higher SEER rating for cooling mode would also usually be more efficient in heating mode, rated using HSPF. When operated in heating mode, a heat pump is typically more efficient than an electrical resistance heater. This is because a space heater can convert only the input electrical energy directly to output heat energy, while a heat pump also transfers heat from outdoors. In heating mode, the coefficient of performance is the ratio of heat provided to the energy used by the unit. An ideal resistance heater converting 100% of its input electricity to output heat would have COP = 1, equivalent to a 3.4 EER. The heat pump becomes less efficient as the outside temperature decreases, and its performance may become comparable to a resistance heater. For a heat pump with the minimum 13 SEER cooling efficiency, this is typically below .Goodman GSH13 Product Specifications Lower temperatures may cause a heat pump to operate below the efficiency of a resistance heater, so conventional heat pumps often include heater coils or auxiliary heating from LP or natural gas to prevent low efficiency operation of the refrigeration cycle. \\"Cold climate\\" heat pumps are designed to optimize efficiency below . In the case of cold climates, water or ground source heat pumps are the most efficient solution. They use the relatively constant temperature of ground water or of water in a large buried loop to moderate the temperature differences in summer and winter and improve performance year round. The heat pump cycle is reversed in the summer to act as an air conditioner.

Situated in the Afar Triangle, it stretches across of arid terrain. It is inhabited by a few Afar, who engage in salt mining. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daytime temperatures surpassing 50 ¬∞C (122 ¬∞F). Less than an inch of rainfall occurs each year. The Danakil Desert is one of the lowest and hottest places on Earth. Dallol (92 metres below sea level), has the hottest average temperature recorded on earth: Geology Danakil landscape Local geology is characterized by volcanic and tectonic activity, various climate cycles, and discontinuous erosion. The basic geological structure of this area was caused by the movement of tectonic plates as Africa moved away from Asia. Mountain chains formed and were eroded again during the Paleozoic. Inundations by the sea caused the formation of layers of sandstone, and limestone was deposited further offshore. As the land rose again, further sandstone formed above the limestone. Further tectonic shifts caused lava to pour out of cracks and cover the sedimentary deposits. The Danakil Desert has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among these is Lake Afrera, which has thick saline crusts on its banks. Other areas of the Danikil became sinks, dry endorheic basins as precipitation evaporates faster than it can collect in permanent lakes. The area is flanked toward the east by the Danakil Alps, a tabular mountain system that has a few volcanic cones which peak in height in Mount Ramlo (). A deposit of salt up to thick can also be found in the Salt Plain flatlands. Other local lakes include Lake Asale ( below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera ( below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the Danakil Depression. The Afrera contains many active volcanoes, including the Maraho, Dabbahu, Afdera and Erta Ale. Human presence The Afar people mine salt, loading each of their camels with up to thirty salt bricks weighing four kilograms each. It will then take two days to get to the nearest town, with guards watching the camels and guarding them from bandits.

In the past, they have sometimes been considered to belong in a separate family, Phlebotomidae, but this alternative classification has not gained wide acceptance.BDWD Family List Epidemiology Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease transmitted by Phlebotomus, in North Africa; Leishmania infantum = green, Leishmania major = blue, Leishmania tropica = red In the Old World, Phlebotomus sand flies are primarily responsible for the transmission of leishmaniasis, an important parasitic disease, while transmission in the New World, is generally via sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia. The protozoan parasite itself is a species of the genus Leishmania. Leishmaniasis normally finds a mammalian reservoir in rodents and other small animals such as canids (canine leishmaniasis) and hyraxes. The female sand fly carries the Leishmania protozoa from infected animals after feeding, thus transmitting the disease, while the male feeds on plant nectar. The parasite Leishmania donovani is the main causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, where it is transmitted by the sand flies of the species Phlebotomus argentipes. This species of sand flies was on the brink of elimination in India during the 1960s following the widespread use of DDT for malaria control. However, there was a resurgence in their population a decade later. Phlebotomus species are also vectors for bartonellosis, verruga peruana, and pappataci fever, an arboviral disease caused by sandfly fever viruses such as the Naples and Sicilian strains of the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), which also includes the closely related Toscana virus. In Egypt, two species of medical importance are Phlebotomus papatasii and P. langerni. These flies are short-lived. Females are bloodsuckers at night; males feed on plant juices. Adults are poor fliers, they usually hop for short distances.  Morphology  Pharynx of Phlebotomus mascittii Adults are about 1.5‚Äì3.0 mm long and yellowish in colour, with conspicuous black eyes, and hairy bodies, wings, and legs. The oval lanceolate wings are carried erect on the humped thorax. Males possess long prominent genital terminalia known as claspers. Females have a pair of anal recti.  Lifecycle  Batches of thirty to seventy eggs are laid in cracks and holes in the ground, in crevices in masonry and among leaf litter. The eggs require a humid environment to avoid desiccation, and hatch within about twenty days. The larvae are mainly scavengers, consuming fungi, leaf mould, rotting vegetation and detritus. The larvae are recognisable by their black heads, greyish twelve segmented bodies and conspicuous feathery, branching bristles on head and body, and two pairs of long hairs on the tip of the abdomen. The larvae pass through four instars over the course of three to four weeks, before selecting an upright position and pupating, with the final larval skin remaining attached to the pupa, the long hairs protruding. In cooler climates, the larvae may diapause over winter. Adults emerge from the pupae after about one to two weeks. The whole cycle takes thirty to sixty days unless the larvae diapause, when it may take four or five months. Laboratory colonies of several Phlebotomus species have been established for experimental study of their biology, behaviour, mutual relations with disease agents, and for testing methods of vector control. Behaviour The adult flies are nocturnal, spending the day sheltering in dark humid places such as on bark, among foliage, among leaf litter, in animal burrows, in termite mounds, and in cracks and crevices. At nightfall they emerge to feed on sugary secretions and plant sap. The female needs a blood meal before it can reproduce; some species feed on mammals including humans, while others also feed on birds, reptiles and amphibians. The fly is a weak flier and takes short flights to find a victim, adopting a \\"hopping\\" style of flight when close to a host. Some sandflies are \\"exophagic\\", living entirely out of doors, while others are \\"endophagic\\" and invade houses. In the tropics, adults may breed all year round, but in temperate climates the adults die off in the autumn and new adults emerge in the spring. The adults have short mouthparts and are unable to bite through clothing.

It was originally formed shortly after the United States' entry into World War II and was modeled after the British Commandos during the war. Members from the unit were the first American soldiers to see combat in the European theater when they participated in the failed raid on Dieppe in France in 1942, during which three Rangers were killed and several more were captured. Later, the 1st Ranger Battalion was sent to North Africa where they participated in the landings in Algeria and the fighting in Tunisia in 1943. Also in 1943 the unit provided cadre for two more Ranger battalions created between the campaigns in Sicily and Italy. After World War II, the 1st Ranger Battalion has gone through a number of changes of name and composition as it has been activated, deactivated and reorganized on a number of occasions. However, the unit has lived on in one form or another since then, serving in the Korean and Vietnam Wars before being consolidated into the 75th Ranger Regiment of which it is a part today. Deployments have included operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan as part of the wider global war on terrorism.  History  = Formation = Major General Lucian Truscott, U.S. Army, in liaison with the British General Staff, submitted proposals to General George Marshall that \\"we undertake immediately an American unit along the lines of the British Commandos\\" in 1942. A subsequent cable from the U.S. Department of War authorized the activation of the 1st U.S. Army Ranger Battalion. After much deliberation, Company A, 1st Ranger Battalion was constituted on 27 May 1942. Captain William Orlando Darby, 31-year-old graduate of West Point with amphibious training, was chosen as its commanding officer. Within weeks he was promoted to major for his efforts in organizing the unit. Of the 1,500 men to volunteer for the original Ranger Battalion, only 600 were chosen. Eighty percent of these original Rangers came from the Red Bulls U.S. 34th Infantry Division. On 19 June 1942, Company A, 1st Ranger Battalion, was officially activated in Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland. A select team of four officers toured the existing commando training camps and selected the center at Achnacarry, Scotland for the Rangers. Here they underwent intense training. Coached by the battle-seasoned commando instructors (commanded by Lt. Col. Charles Vaughan), the Rangers learned the basics of commando warfare. Five hundred of the 600 volunteers (83.33%) that Darby brought with him to Achnacarry completed the commando training. Many could not endure the exercises; one Ranger was killed, while several others were wounded in training so realistic that it was executed under live fire. = World War II =  1st Battalion goes active  The first Americans to see active combat in the European theater of World War II were forty-four enlisted men and five officers from the 1st Ranger Battalion. Dispersed among the Canadians and the British commandos, these men were the first American ground soldiers to see action against the Germans in the disastrous Dieppe Raid, officially known as Operation Jubilee. Three Rangers were killed and several captured. The first American soldier killed in Europe in World War II was part of the Dieppe Raid, Ranger Lieutenant E. V. Loustalot. During the mission, the British Captain leading the assault was killed. Loustalot took command and with his men attacked a clifftop machine gun nest. Scaling the steep cliff, Loustalot was wounded three times and then was killed by enemy crossfire.  North Africa  The first efforts to stop the German infiltration of Europe were by the 1st Ranger Battalion. Attempting to prevent German occupation of seaports in North Africa, the 1st Ranger Battalion spearheaded an invasion at the Port of Arzew in Algeria. This was accomplished by executing a surprise night landing, silencing two gun batteries, and opening the way for the capture of Oran. In Tunisia in 1943, the 1st Battalion executed the first Ranger behind-the-lines night raid for the purpose of gaining information and terrorizing the enemy. On 11 February the Rangers took a journey, 12 on foot, for their first raid on an Italian camp at Sened Station. Using the cloak of night, the Rangers slipped in of the Italian outpost and began their attack. It took the battalion only 20 minutes to achieve area control. Fifty enemy were killed and an additional 10 were taken prisoner. Darby, along with fellow commanders, was awarded the Silver Star for this victory and the battalion itself gained the nickname the \\"Black Death\\" by the Italians. Later, in March, American units were decimated time and again while trying to break through the critical mountain pass at Djbel Ank. Given this mission, the 1st Rangers undertook a twelve-mile (19 km) night march through rugged terrain to reach the heights of Djbel Ank where, at dawn, the Rangers surprised the enemy from the rear, capturing two hundred prisoners and giving General Patton an opening though which he began the final and victorious battle in North Africa. Rangers played a crucial role in the battle of El Guettar which immediately followed, for which the First Ranger Battalion won its first Presidential Unit Citation (US).  Sicily and Italy  The early success of the 1st Ranger Battalion brought about the creation of the 3rd and 4th Battalions. The original 1st Battalion was divided into thirds. One third of the headquarters and each company was placed in each of the Battalions 1-3-4. 3rd Ranger Battalion was Activated on 21 May 1943 at Nemours, Morocco, while 4th Ranger Battalion was activated on 29 May 1943 in Tunisia. To provide command and control for these three Ranger Battalions, the 6615th Ranger Force (Provisional) was established. This force was rounded out with the addition of the 83rd Chemical Mortar Battalion, and the 2/509th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The battle seasoned 1st Battalion moved into their newly assigned positions and trained their Ranger colleagues. The 1-3-4 Battalions were trained under Darby in Nemours, Morocco and prepared for the invasion of Sicily and Italy. Following the 1st Ranger Battalion success at the Amphibious Battle of Gela, all four of the initial Ranger Battalions were redesignated as Ranger Infantry Battalions on 1 August 1943 Had it not been for the accomplishments of the 1st Ranger Battalion in the early entry of WWII, there would be no Rangers today. Their successful invasions in North Africa opened the sea and its ports for the Allied forces. The Allies were now able to move ships and equipment to support subsequent campaigns, enabling the later forces to successfully infiltrate enemy lines along the African coast, in Sicily, and up into Italy. The Ranger Force targeted Salerno on 9 September 1943, and participated in the Naples-Foggia Campaign. Then they moved on to Anzio on 22 January 1944. The entire 6615th Ranger Force (Provisional) was destroyed behind enemy lines in a heavily outnumbered encounter at Cisterna, Italy on 30 January 1944, and was officially disbanded on 15 August 1944. The 4th Ranger Battalion suffered some casualties while attempting to break through enemy lines to rescue their comrades in the 1st and 3rd Battalions. The 1st, 3rd, and 4th Battalions were known as Darby's Rangers.  Postwar  The 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, in response to parallel missions in Berlin, was reconstituted on 1 September 1948 as Company A, 1st Infantry Battalion, and activated in the Canal Zone. It served there until it was inactivated on 4 January 1950. = Korea = The outbreak of hostilities in Korea in June 1950 again signaled the need for Rangers. Colonel John Gibson Van Houten was selected by the Army Chief of Staff to head the Ranger training program at Ft. Benning, Georgia. 1st Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) departed from Ft. Benning, Georgia on 15 November 1950, and arrived in Korea on 17 December 1950, where it was attached to the 2nd Infantry Division. The 1st Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) opened with an extraordinary example of land navigation, then executed a daring night raid behind enemy lines destroying an enemy complex. The enemy installation was later identified by a prisoner as the headquarters of the 12th North Korean Division. Caught by surprise and unaware of the size of the American force, two North Korean Regiments hastily withdrew from the area. The 1st Company was in the middle of the major battle of Chipyong-Ni and the \\"May Massacre.\\" It was awarded two Distinguished Unit Citations. As a result of budgetary considerations, the US Army spent much of the 1950s and 1960s consolidating and redesignating units that were on inactive status. This unit was redesignated 24 November 1952 as Company A, 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, in inactive status and was consolidated on 15 April 1960 with the A Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Regiment, 1st Special Service Force, and the consolidated unit was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 7th Special Forces Group(SFG), 1st Special Forces Group. The unit was further consolidated 6 June 1960 with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 77th Special Forces Group, and the consolidated unit was designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 7th SFG, 1st SFG (organic elements constituted 20 May 1960 and activated 6 June 1960). = Vietnam = On 1 January 1969, under the new U.S. Army Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS), U.S. Army Rangers were re-formed in South Vietnam as the 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger). Fifteen companies of Rangers, two of which (A-75 & B-75) were based in the US, were raised from units that had been performing missions in Europe since the late 1950s and in Vietnam since 1966 as Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol and Long Range Patrol companies. = Post- Vietnam = After the Vietnam War, division and brigade commanders determined that the U.S. Army needed an elite, rapid deployment, light infantry, so in 1974 General Creighton Abrams charged General Kenneth C. Leuer with the task of activating, organizing, training and leading the first battalion sized Ranger unit since World War II. Because of the success of the 1st Ranger Battalion; eight months later, the 2nd Ranger Battalion was constituted, and in 1984 the 3rd Ranger Battalion and their regimental headquarters were created. The 1st Ranger Battalion have participated in the following operations: the 1980 rescue attempt of American hostages, Tehran, Iran in (Operation Eagle Claw); Operation Urgent Fury on Grenada in 1983; the U.S. invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause) in 1989; Bravo Company, 1st Battalion was deployed in the First Persian Gulf War (Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield) in 1991; soldiers from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Ranger Battalions deployed to Haiti in 1994 (before operation's cancellation; recalled 5 miles (8.0 km) from the Haitian coast); the entire Ranger Regiment is on deployment since the start of the Iraq War, in 2003. = War on Terror = A Ranger from the 1st Ranger Battalion scans for insurgents during a combat operation in Afghanistan, 17 April 2013 Since December 2001, after the events of 9/11, elements of Headquarters Company and Company A deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In 2002, the entire battalion returned to Afghanistan to support the continuing Global War on Terrorism, in March 2002, during Operation Anaconda, 35 Rangers from the battalion had been assigned as QRF for all Task Force 11 operations, but only half of the platoon was available for the Battle of Takur Ghar.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp. 64‚Äì65, 67‚Äì69, In 2003, 1st Battalion participated in combat operations in support of Iraq War, conducting missions across the entire country of Iraq. 290 Rangers from the battalion and 2nd Battalion distinguished itself during the successful rescue of the prisoner-of-war, PFC Jessica Lynch.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 The battalion currently supports the Global War on Terrorism, regularly rotating elements to Afghanistan continuing to successfully dismantle terrorist networks; For actions between 14‚Äì16 November 2010, Charlie Company received the Valorous Unit Award for extraordinary heroism, combat achievement and conspicuous gallantry while executing combat operations in support of a named operation. With ISAFs surge in Afghanistan at its peak in summer 2011, for actions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom between 15 May ‚Äì 28 August 2011 that included: conducting continuous combat operations, including time sensitive raids and deliberate movement to contact operations while in enemy held terrain out of reach by other friendly forces, in places like Khost, Paktika and Nangarhar Province, the battalion received the Meritorious Unit Citation in particular its Bravo Company received the Valorous Unit Award; 2 Rangers from the battalion were killed during this time. Primary tasks include: direct action, national and international emergency crisis response, airfield seizure, airborne & air assault operations, special reconnaissance, intelligence & counter intelligence, combat search and rescue, personnel recovery & hostage rescue, joint special operations, and counter terrorism. Peter Kassig, a former Ranger who was with the 1st Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, later became an aid worker in Syria. He was taken hostage by The Islamic State, and ultimately beheaded. , the battalion has made 22 deployments during the Global War on Terrorism.

Founded in the 13th century by Saint Tekle Haymanot, he meditated in a cave for 29 years. The monastery's chief abbot, called the Ichege, was the second most powerful official in the Ethiopian Church after the Abuna. The monastery complex sits on a terrace between a cliff and the gorge of one of the tributaries of the Abbay River. None of the original buildings of Debre Libanos survive, although David Buxton suspected \\"there are interesting things still to be found among the neighbouring cliffs.\\"David Buxton, Travels in Ethiopia, second edition (London: Benn, 1957), p. 64 Current buildings include the church over Tekle Haymanot's tomb, which Emperor Haile Selassie ordered constructed in 1961; a slightly older Church of the Cross, where Buxton was told a fragment of the True Cross is preserved; and five religious schools. The cave where the saint lived is in the nearby cliffs, which one travel guide describes as a five-minute walk away.Matt Philips and Jean-Bernard Carillet, Ethiopia and Eritrea, third edition (n.p.: Lonely Planet, 2006), p. 111 This cave contains a spring, whose water is considered holy and is the object of pilgrimages. According to David Buxton, the original route to Debre Libanos was through a cleft in the cliffs that line the eastern side of the Abay.Buxton, Travels, p. 65 In the later 20th century a road was laid from the main Addis Ababa ‚Äì Debre Marqos highway to the monastery; it is a little more than four kilometers long.Philip Briggs, Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide, 3rd edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2002), p. 174  History  Debre Libanos is an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo monastery. Debre Libanos suffered great destruction during the invasion of Ahmad Gragn when one of his followers, Ura'i Abu Bakr, set it on fire 21 July 1531, despite the attempts of its community to ransom the church.Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), pp. 186‚Äì193. Although the Ichege intervened to protect the Gambos during the reign of Sarsa Dengel,Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 266 the buildings were not completely rebuilt until after the visit of Emperor Iyasu the Great in 1699.Pankhurst, Borderlands, p. 312 In the reign of Emperor Fasilides, after invading Oromos had ravaged the monastery's lands in Shewa the Emperor granted the Ichege his palace at Azazo, where the various Ichege lived.Richard Pankhurst, History of Ethiopian Towns (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), p. 111. From the 17th century until the matter was resolved in a synod convened by Emperor Yohannes II, the Ichege and the monks of Debre Libanos were the most important supporters of the Sost Lidet doctrine, in opposition to the House of Ewostatewos. Emperor Haile Selassie's interest in Debre Libanos dates to when he was governor of the district of Selale. The Emperor notes in his autobiography that during the reconstruction of the church at Debre Libanos, an inscribed gold ring was found in the excavations, which he personally delivered to then Emperor Menelik II.Haile Selassie, My Life and Ethiopia's Progress, 1974 (Chicago: Frontline Distribution International, 1997), p. 27. Following the attempted assassination on his life on 19 February 1937, governor Rodolfo Graziani believed the monastery's monks and novices were involved in this attack, and unwilling to wait for the results of the official investigation, ordered Italian colonialists to massacre the inhabitants of this monastery. On 21 May of that year, 297 monks and 23 laymen were killed.A more complete account of the events known in Ethiopia as \\"Yekatit 12\\" is chapter 14 of Anthony Mockler's Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003). Although when Buxton visited Debre Libanos in the mid-1940s, he found the remains of these victims were plainly visible (\\"Here were innumerable bones and skulls ‚Äì bones in bags and bones in boxes, bones lying in confused heaps, awaiting burial\\"); a cross-shaped tomb was afterwards built to contain their remains, which stands next to the parking lot.Philips and Carillet, Ethiopia and Eritrea, p. 111 Mosaics Mosaics and stained- glass for the monastery were made and exhibited in London at the Festival Hall by E.O.

The first Aqua Fest occurred Aug. 3-12, 1962. Art Linkletter was the headliner for the event. The festival offered many water related events such as a 150-mile canoe race, fishing contests, a sailing regatta and an illuminated night time parade on the lake. There were many land based events also including the Miss Austin Aqua Beauty contest, a twilight land parade, a daytime military parade, a rodeo, golf tournament, concerts, dances and fireworks. Patrons of the fest could purchase a book of discount tickets to get into the various venues. The tickets were called Skipper Script. The next year, the script gave way to the Skipper Pin, which was purchased and pinned on the goers clothing, letting the workers know that the wearer was eligible for discounts on tickets. The central location for many of the events was \\"Festival Beach,\\" a small park on Town Lake between the city-owned power plant and a residential neighborhood. The city had originally created Town Lake as a cooling pond for the power plant. In 1964, the festival added one of its most popular and controversial events, drag boat racing on Town Lake. It also added a water skiing championship, kite flying championship and an Austin Grand Prix - sports car racing on city streets. The 1966 Aqua Fest started out with the world premiere of Batman, with Adam West and other actors from the movie in attendance. 1966 also saw the start of the \\"Battle of the Bands\\", in which unknown rock and roll bands were judged for awards and recognition. Battle of the Bands would become the festival's top draw. The United States Air Force air demonstration squadron, the Thunderbirds first performed at the Fest the same year. By 1968, an estimated crowd of 150,000 watched the night lighted water parade, which had been renamed to Rio Noche parade in 1964. The crowds were starting to overwhelm Festival Beach causing traffic congestion, parking problems and security concerns for the residents plus the noise of the events, especially the drag boats. However, the mostly Hispanic community had very little political clout to get anything changed. =Theme nights= Theme nights began in 1969. Various nights of the festival would highlight different cultures of Texas. This first year there was Western, German, Czech and Jazz and Rhythm and Blues nights. Throughout the years the theme nights varied as new ones were tried and unpopular ones not repeated. These included Mexican, Black Heritage, Italian, American and International nights. Toward the end of the festival's life, the theme nights had settled to multiple nights with Western and Mexican themes. = Aero-Fest = Also in 1969, Bergstrom Air Force Base, on the southeast edge of Austin, began an open house in conjunction with Aqua Fest and titled it Aero-Fest. In addition to the Thunderbirds performing, the gathering showed off many military airplanes and other hardware. A crowd favorite was a C-5 Galaxy, which visitors would walk through to get to the main display area. Aero-Fest was an instant success and in just two years it was drawing 80,000 people to the base. Aero-Fest ceased when the base closed in 1993.  1970‚Äì1979  The new decade saw Aqua Fest's continued growth with the addition of more new events such as a photography contest and motocross in 1971 and the Pet Parade in 1972. But the growth of the event brought confrontation with the neighborhoods surrounding Festival Beach. Complaints had gone unheeded and people finally took to the streets in protest. The anti-Fest coalition was led by Paul Hernandez and a group calling itself the \\"Brown Berets.\\" Protesters were arrested and they in turn sued the City of Austin and Aqua Fest. By the end of the decade, the drag boat races were gone from Town Lake and pressure was on to find a new location to hold other Aqua Fest events. 1980‚Äì1989 Due to continued protest and growing crowds, Aqua Fest was moved from Festival Beach to Auditorium Shores, a larger park along Town Lake about a mile to the west of Festival Beach. This larger area meant the festival could now have multiple stages for entertainment. The festival organizers signed up corporate sponsors and local radio stations to co-sponsor the entertainment and began booking national acts. The City of Austin, which had subsidized Aqua Fest in its early years, now believed the Fest was self-sufficient and withdrew its financial support. The city began charging the festival for use of Auditorium Shores. In 1985, attendance at Aqua Fest peaked at 252,000. More criticism came at the festival for lack of parking, excessive noise and alcohol abuse issues. This time the rebuke was from residents of the Bouldin Creek neighborhood just south of Auditorium Shores. The opponents of the festival were able to force a non-binding referendum to move Aqua Fest to Lake Walter E. Long in far east Austin. The measure passed but promised corporate support to build a new facility went away as Texas entered an oil bust in the middle of the decade. Aqua Fest stayed at Auditorium Shores. 1990‚Äì1998 With its multiple stages for entertainment, Aqua Fest changed from a civic event to a live music event. The organizers began to book bigger and bigger acts, even paying premiums to get popular acts such as Dolly Parton in 1992. This drove ticket prices up and attendance down. By 1993, the festival only drew 44,000 people and as a result lost $722,000. The festival organization exhausted its cash reserves and asked its largest creditor, the City of Austin, for permission to pay off its debt in annual installments. In 1994, Aqua Fest returned to its roots with more local acts and an all volunteer staff and in 1995 brought back the popular theme nights. They also tried drag boat races again, this time at Lake Walter E. Long, but the races drew little interest. It was all too little, too late and the Austin Aqua Festival folded in 1998.

The mountain is a steeply rising plateau of trapezoidal shape, about 1000 by 400 m in dimension. It sits at an elevation of 2216 m above sea level. It is north-west of Adigrat, in the Mehakelegnaw Zone of the Tigray Region, close to the border with Eritrea. The monastery, accessible only by rope up a sheer cliff, 15 m high, is known for its collection of manuscripts and for having the earliest existing church building in Ethiopia that is still in its original style, and only men can visit it. Tradition claims the monastery was founded in the 6th century by Abuna Aregawi. Monastery The monastery received its first archeological examination by E.

Biography  Fresenius was born on 28 December 1818, in Frankfurt, Germany. After working for some time for a pharmacy in his native town, he entered Bonn University in 1840, and a year later migrated to Gie√üen, where he acted as assistant in Liebig's laboratory, and in 1843, became an assistant professor. In 1845, he was appointed to the chair of chemistry, physics and technology at the Wiesbaden Agricultural Institution, and three years later, he became the first director of the chemical laboratory which he induced the Nassau government to establish at that place. Under his leadership and direction, this laboratory continuously increased in size and popularity, a school of pharmacy being added in 1862 (though given up in 1877) and an agricultural research laboratory in 1868. Apart from his administrative duties, Fresenius occupied himself almost exclusively with analytical chemistry, and the fullness and accuracy of his textbooks on that subject (of which that on qualitative analysis first appeared in 1841 and that on quantitative in 1846) soon rendered them standard works. Many of Fresenius's original papers were published in the Zeitschrift f√ºr analytische Chemie, which he founded in 1862 and continued to edit until his death. Remarkably this journal (also known as Fresenius' Zeitschrift f√ºr Analytische Chemie or Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry and the world's first analytical chemistry journal) had produced 371 volumes, all but one of which had been edited or co-edited by a member of the Fresenius family. Spanning three centuries (1862‚Äì2001) the Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry as it was known came to an end when it became Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, which is still running as of 2014. In 1881, Fresenius handed over the directorship of the agricultural research station to his son, Remigius Heinrich Fresenius (1847‚Äì1920), who was trained under H. Kolbe at Leipzig. Another son, Theodor Wilhelm Fresenius (1856‚Äì1936), was educated at Strasbourg and occupied various positions in the Wiesbaden laboratory. Fresenius died suddenly at Wiesbaden at age 78, on 11 June 1897.

As a sociological term, the definition and description of cultural pluralism has evolved over time. It has been described as not only a fact but a societal goal.William R. Hazard and Madelon Stent, \\"Cultural Pluralism and Schooling: Some Preliminary Observations,\\" Cultural Pluralism in Education: A Mandate for Change, eds. Madelon Stent, William R. Hazard and Harry N. Revlin (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1973), p. 13.  Pluralist culture  In a pluralist culture, groups not only coexist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture. Pluralistic societies place strong expectations of integration on members, rather than expectations of assimilation. The existence of such institutions and practices is possible if the cultural communities are accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture and sometimes require the protection of the law. Often the acceptance of a culture may require that the new or minority culture remove some aspects of their culture which is incompatible with the laws or values of the dominant culture. Some pluralists such as Hamed Kazemzadeh argues that the concept of pluralist culture was prevalent since ancient times. Even the Achaemenid Empire which founded by Cyrus the Great successfully followed a policy of incorporating and tolerating various cultures.  Distinction from multiculturalism  Cultural pluralism is distinct from multiculturalism, which lacks the requirement of a dominant culture. If the dominant culture is weakened, societies can easily pass from cultural pluralism into multiculturalism without any intentional steps being taken by that society. If communities function separately from each other, or compete with one another, they are not considered culturally pluralistic. In 1971, the Canadian government referred to cultural pluralism, as opposed to multiculturalism, as the \\"very essence\\" of the nation's identity.House of Commons. 8 October 1971. Debates, 28th Parliament, 3rd Session, Volume 8. Ottawa: Library and Archives Canada. via \\"Canadian Multicultural Policy 1971.\\" Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21. Cultural pluralism can be practiced at varying degrees by a group or an individual.Haug, Marie R. 1967. \\"Social and Cultural Pluralism as a Concept in Social System Analysis.\\" American Journal of Sociology 73(3):294‚Äì304. . A prominent example of pluralism is 20th-century United States, in which a dominant culture with strong elements of nationalism, a sporting culture, and an artistic culture contained also smaller groups with their own ethnic, religious, and cultural norms.  History  The notion of cultural pluralism in the United States has its roots in the transcendentalist movement, and was developed by pragmatist philosophers such as Horace Kallen, William James, and John Dewey. Randolph Bourne, a later theorist, provided one of the most famous articulations of cultural pluralism through his 1916 essay, \\"Trans-National America\\".\\"Cultural Pluralism.\\" Science Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 31 May 2007. Kallen is widely credited as being the originator of the concept of cultural pluralism.Toll, William. 1997. \\"Horace M.

Associated University Presses. .Sanday, Peggy R. 1976. Anthropology and the Public Interest. New York: Academic Press. . His 1915 essay in The Nation, titled \\"Democracy versus the Melting Pot\\", was written as an argument against the concept of the 'Americanization' of European immigrants.Kallen, Horace. 18-25 February 1915. \\"Democracy Versus the Melting Pot.\\" The Nation 100(2590):190‚Äì94, 217‚Äì20. He coined the term cultural pluralism, itself, in 1924 through his Culture and Democracy in the United States.Kallen, Horace. 1924. Culture and Democracy in the United States. New York: Boni & Liveright. pp. 126‚Äì29. In 1976, the concept was further explored by Merwin Crawford Young in The Politics of Cultural Pluralism. Young's work, in African studies, emphasizes the flexibility of the definition of cultural pluralism within a society.Young, Merwin Crawford. 1976. The Politics of Cultural Pluralism. University of Wisconsin Press. More recent advocates include moral and cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder. A 1976 article in the Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare offered a redefinition of cultural pluralism, described as a social condition in which communities of different cultures live together and function in an open system.Pantoja, Antonia, Wilhelmina Perry, and Barbara Blourock. 1976. \\"Towards the Development of Theory: Cultural Pluralism Redefined.\\" The Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare 4(1):11. .

It received its concession on May 30, 1968, and came to air on June 3. Broadcasting on channel 10 with an effective radiated power of 8,200 watts, XHK was a sister to XENT- AM 790, also owned by Francisco King Rondero and the first radio station in the territory, and the two stations formed the Radio and Television Center (Centro de Radio y Televisi√≥n). XHK's local programs included news, sports, and lifestyle programs, as well as programming from Televisa (primarily through FOROtv and Gala TV) including international news and telenovelas. Local programming at the station's closure included its evening newscasts, El Pulso BCS, as well as A Medio D√≠a, a local newsmagazine aired at midday. Despite being authorized for digital television and obtaining technical approval to broadcast on channel 34 with 50 kilowatts,RPC: Final authorization for XHK-TDT the station went off air with the analog shutdown on December 31, 2015. An SCT representative noted that the station was lacking in administrative, financial and technical capacity, but that XHK could return to the air in digital. Another issue casting their ability to resume transmissions into doubt is that the station had not paid employees for several pay periods, failing to pay Christmas bonuses, social security or savings fund contributions, and the union representing 28 of XHK's 40 employees was considering going on strike. Later that month, electrical service was shut off to the Canal 10 studios for nonpayment. It would not be until September that XHK would go into liquidation, selling off embargoed assets in order to raise funds to pay the station's employees.

He attended the secret meetings organized by Josefa Ortiz de Dom√≠nguez, where the possibility of an independent New Spain was discussed. He fought along with Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in the first stage of the struggle, eventually succeeding him in leadership of the rebellion. Allende was captured by Spanish colonial authorities while he was in Coahuila and executed for treason in Chihuahua. Biography Allende statue in Chihuahua City, Chihuahua. Posthumous portrait of Ignacio Allende (1769-1811). Allende was born on January 21, 1769, to a wealthy Spanish criollo family in San Miguel el Grande in Guanajuato, Mexico. His father was Domingo Narciso de Allende, a wealthy trader. In 1802, he joined the army, serving under general F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja. In 1806, he started to favor the possibility of independence from Spain. His attendance at a conspiratorial meeting in Valladolid (today Morelia) was discovered, in 1809, by the Spanish and went unsanctioned. Regardless, Allende kept supporting the underground independence movement. He was eventually invited by the mayor of Quer√©taro, Miguel Dom√≠nguez and his wife Josefa Ort√≠z de Dom√≠nguez to discuss further plans for independence at their home. It was during one of these meetings where Allende met Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and his captain Juan Aldama. Originally, the independence movement was to be led jointly by Allende and Aldama. A change of plans prompted by the discovery of the conspiracy forced Hidalgo to start the rebellion earlier than agreed. The \\"Grito de Dolores\\" uttered by Hidalgo signaled the beginning of the revolution, after which the conspirators rallied behind him. The rebel army quickly captured the town of Dolores and marched towards San Miguel el Grande, where Allende obtained the support of his cavalry regiment. On September 22, 1810, Hidalgo y Costilla was officially made captain general of the Revolutionary army while Allende was made lieutenant general. After the famous capture of the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas, in Guanajuato, and his victory in the Battle of Monte de las Cruces Allende suggested Hidalgo march toward Mexico City and capture it. As a consequence of the rebels' defeat in the Battle of Calder√≥n Bridge, the leadership of the Revolutionary army demanded the replacement of Hidalgo as their leader. Allende took this new responsibility and, with a decimated army, he decided to march north to the United States, with the goal of making connections with those in the United States for support. The rebels, however, were ambushed at the Wells of Baj√°n due to the betrayal of Ignacio Elizondo, leading to the capture of Allende, Hidalgo, and several other commanders. Allende's illegitimate child Indalecio was killed during this ambush. Allende was taken to the city of Chihuahua where he was tried for insubordination and imprisoned. He was informed of 2,000 Americans located near San Antonio de Bexar and asked for a meeting with the viceroy in order to contemplate a joint solution in defending a potential American invasion. His requested was denied and was executed by firing squad on June 26, 1811. His body was decapitated and his head taken to the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas where it was shown to the public inside a cage hung from one corner of the building. In 1824 his remains were buried in the vault reserved for the viceroys and presidents in the cathedral of Mexico. His remains were moved in 1925 to the Independence Column in Mexico City.  Legacy  Allende is a national hero of Mexico. Places named in his honor include the municipal district and city of San Miguel de Allende in the state of Guanajuato, and the Chihuahua municipal district of Allende and its municipal seat, Valle de Allende.

The format is similar to the \\"Fish\\" branded stations Salem owns elsewhere and its slogan is: \\"Your Life...Inspired\\". The station is considered the number one Adult Contemporary Christian Music station in the country with the largest number of listeners. History KLTY began playing a mix of Adult Contemporary Christian music (CCM). KLTY lasted only from early August 1985 to late September 1986 when station owner Scott K. Ginsburg changed the call letters to KHYI and changed the format to Top 40 as \\"Y-95\\". The transmitter site was not at Cedar Hill the primary antenna farm for Dallas radio, but instead transmitted from Lillian, Texas with over 30,000 watts of effective radiated power. Marcos A. Rodriguez was a fan of the original KLTY and saw potential in the format - especially if a radio station could play it 24 hours a day. He purchased the music library from Ginsburg and began planning the conversion of 94.1 to all CCM. However, he was unable to make a deal for the KLTY call letters (because they were held by an FM station in Liberty, Missouri. Before it became 94.1 KOJO, the frequency was used by then-sister station KESS. Elfstrand now leads The Morning Ride team at WMBI Chicago. KOJO was notable for its commitment to being a \\"full service\\" radio station, including a solid news commitment. Morning and afternoon drive newscasts were anchored by former KVIL news director Bob Morrison and Calvin Whitman, and later, Dave Tucker. Morrison moved up to a national network news management position as News and Sports Director of the USA Radio Network, based in Dallas, for 8 1/2 years (until USA was sold and moved to Memphis). In the spring of 1989, with a free Michael W. Smith concert, Rodriguez created the first Celebrate Freedom-style event and relaunched the KLTY call letters. Marcos A. Rodriguez went on to produce Celebrate Freedom festivals at Southfork Ranch and build the event into one of the biggest Christian Music festivals in America. Rodriguez sold KLTY to Sunburst Media L.P. in 1999 for $63.3 million and retired. After the sale of KVIL it was the highest price ever paid for a Dallas FM. KLTY was on 100.7 MHz from January 2000 to December 2000, and was owned by Sunburst until it was sold to Salem. Salem swapped the Christian talk format that had been on 94.9 for nearly two and a half years known as \\"The Word\\", and placed the popular KLTY on a 94.9 signal while \\"The Word\\" went to 100.7. This placed the KLTY callsign back on its original frequency. KLTY now transmits with 100,000 watts ERP from Cedar Hill, Texas. While KLTY plays a Contemporary Christian music playlist, it has been classified as Adult Contemporary (AC) according to Mediabase.Maverick Dallas Outlet Achieves Benchmark KLTY served (and can still serve) as the de facto \\"AC\\" station for DFW from mid-2013 to late December 2016 due to CBS Radio-owned 103.7 KVIL contemporizing its playlist to focus on 1990s to current product (with an Adult Top 40 lean) before Mediabase moved the station to \\"Hot AC\\" a year later (from October 2016 until February 2017 KVIL was a CHR/Top 40 station. Since November 2017 KVIL broadcasts an Alternative Rock format using the moniker Alt 103.7). As of December 26, 2016, KDGE (102.1) in Fort Worth serves as the official \\"AC\\" station for DFW. KLAK (97.5) in Tom Bean, Texas was another \\"AC\\" station that served areas north and east of the metroplex until it migrated to a \\"Hot AC\\" fare themselves in November 2017. History of 94.9 FM The 94.9 frequency has a rich history, long predating the current format and ownership. KCLE was established in 1949 in Cleburne, Texas, by owners Jim Gordon and George Marti at 94.3 FM and 1120 AM. Marti was later the inventor of microwave transmitters (known as \\"Marti Units.\\") Employees included notables such as Russ Bloxom (later news anchor at WBAP/KXAS-TV,) Don Harris (personality at WBAP-AM) and Mike Ambrose (later with KLIF-AM, and a San Diego TV weatherman for 28 years.) The station moved to 94.9 in 1957. In 1969, Gordon and Marti ended their partnership; Marti took the AM station and Gordon, the FM. Gordon flipped the FM to KFAD, with an underground/progressive rock format. Notables included Jon Dillon (now at KZPS), writer Phillip Cook, Dave Thomas and Joe Nick Patoski (later the senior editor of Texas Monthly magazine. On January 1, 1972, Dick Osburn took ownership of the station, and reimaged it as KAMC (\\"K-Mac\\") while continuing the underground music format. By 1974, the format flipped to \\"Progressive Country\\" when former KFAD talent Biff Big Johnson convinced Dick Osburn and Program Director Ken Bateman to mix country and rock with a show called \\"The Country Sunday\\". It worked so well that the station dropped the underground rock and became the first 24-hour Progressive Country station in America. Biff had been the first jock when KSCS went Country the year before. KAMC was the only station in Dallas - Ft. Worth to play Outlaw Country artists like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. A notable employee of KAMC was Bill Merrill, who did play-by-play for the Texas Rangers. On June 19, 1976, with the station now licensed to Arlington, it was sold to Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and became KWJS (the Word of Jimmy Swaggart) and to new KJIM calls in 1984. (The KJIM calls were resurrected from KJIM-870 AM, who used them from 1957‚Äì1984.) KLTY logo from 2000 until mid-2017.

He is best remembered for introducing the motion of no confidence to the Greek constitution, proposing and funding such ambitious and modern projects as the construction of the Corinth Canal, but also eventually leading the country to bankruptcy. Nowadays, he is commonly considered one of the greatest Greek Prime Ministers to ever have served. Background Born in Nauplion in 1832, with family ties to Messolonghi, he was the son of Spiridon Trikoupis, a politician who was Prime Minister of Greece briefly in 1833, and Ekaterini Mavrokordatou, sister of Alexandros Mavrokordatos, who also served as a Prime Minister. After studying law and literature in University of Athens and in Paris, where he obtained his doctorate, he was sent to London in 1852 as an attach√© of the Greek legation. By 1863, he had risen to be charg√© d'affaires, but he aimed rather at a political not a diplomatic career. Trikoupis' family had been original supporters of the English Party; that and his reserved nature bestowed on him the nickname \\"the Englishman.\\" In 1865, after he had concluded the negotiations for the cession by United Kingdom to Greece of the Ionian Islands, he returned to Athens and in 1865 he was elected to the Hellenic Parliament, and in the following year was made Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the young age of thirty-four. \\"Who's to Blame?\\" In 1872 he created his own party, called the Fifth Party (Œ†Œ≠ŒºœÄœÑŒø ŒöœåŒºŒºŒ±) on a reformist agenda. On June 29, 1874 (Julian calendar) he published a manifesto in the Athens daily Kairoi entitled \\"Who's to blame?\\" (Œ§ŒπœÇ Œ†œÑŒ±ŒØŒµŒπ;), naming the King as the answer. Specifically, he condemned the king for bypassing public opinion expressed in elections in his selection of Prime Ministers. Trikoupis wrote that the political instability, which characterized the public life was due to the privilege of the crown as far as the appointment and ousting of governments was concerned. This privilege may have derived from the Greek Constitution of 1864, but it resulted in the formation of weak minority governments based exclusively on the royal favor. Moreover, it underlined that if \\"a remedy is not applied\\", the country will revolt. In order to prevent this, the writer suggested the restriction of the royal privileges with the introduction of the principle of the \\"declared confidence\\" which, as he supported, would bring about the harmonization of the political life via the formation of a basically two-party parliamentary system: \\"When it (the kingship) sincerely decides to accept that it invites to power only the majority, there is doubt that in Greece, as elsewhere, this enviable honour will not remain exposed for long. Therefore, it is not the fault of the regime, it is not the fault of the representatives of the Nation, it is not the fault of the Nation, if the Parliament is divided in many parties and has not the majority when demanded‚Ä¶ The vice lies elsewhere and it is there that a remedy should be sought\\". The article landed him briefly in jail but also boosted his popularity significantly. A year later, on May 8, 1875 he mustered a parliamentary plurality and King George I reluctantly named him as Prime Minister as the leader of a new Reformist party called the New (or Modernist) Party (ŒùŒµœâœÑŒµœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ ŒöœåŒºŒºŒ±). Political power and struggles Trikoupis at the podium of the Hellenic Parliament. Trikoupis played a major role in the evolution of a genuine parliamentary process in Greece through the adoption of the dedilomeni principle, but his reformist projects suffered because of frequent electoral upheavals. Among his first acts was the reform of election law and the establishment of the \\"dedilomeni principle\\" (Œ±œÅœáŒÆ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¥ŒµŒ¥Œ∑ŒªœâŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ): the \\"declared [confidence of Parliament]\\", obliging the king to appoint the leader of the party with a plurality of parliamentary votes as the Prime Minister. The dedilomeni principle may have contributed to Greece quickly becoming a two-party state as smaller parties merged in an effort to form a plurality. Initially observed by convention, the dedilomeni has been incorporated into all subsequent Greek constitutions and ushered Greece into modern parliamentary politics. The opposing party to Trikoupis's Modernist Party was the conservative Nationalist Party led by Alexandros Koumoundouros. With ever-changing alliances in parliament and fluctuating election results, Greece went through twelve prime ministers in the next six years. Trikoupis headed three of these short-lived governments. The 1875 general election on October 4 was considered the most honest election held to that date in Greece: Trikoupis lost. His short period in office meant he had no opportunity to begin carrying out the aggressive reform program which he had in mind. His foreign policy was to develop the resources of his country so as to create an army and a fleet, and thus to give Greece the power to acquire a leading place among the nations of Southeastern Europe. It was not until 1882 that he was able to take measures to this end. On March 15, 1882 he became prime minister for the third time (his second period of office, two years earlier, had lasted only for a few months), and at once set about the task of putting Greek finance upon a firmer basis, and of increasing the prosperity of the country by making roads, railways and harbours. Despite his vision of a progressive nation with modern infrastructure, Greece in the latter part of the 19th century was a poor and backwards country. Greek satirical poster of 1895 depicting Trikoupis and his main political opponent Theodoros Deligiannis. The flag reads: \\"down with the taxes, up with the loans!\\" His government was relatively stable and lasted for more than three years. During that time, he was able to push through an aggressive program of reforms. Trikoupis was a strong believer in the need to create an infrastructure to support the economy, and to attract foreign investment. A progressive program of road and railroad construction significantly improved internal communications. The most important of the works he campaigned for was the digging of the Corinth Canal. Another project that Trikoupis envisioned during that period was a bridge to connect the cities of Rion and Antirion across the Gulf of Corinth. The bridge was beyond the technical and financial abilities of the young Kingdom at that time; construction began more than a century later. The bridge, officially named the Charilaos Trikoupis Bridge in his honour, was completed in 2004. His difficulties, however, were now increased by the large expenditure that had been incurred for military preparations while he had been out of office as the result of the union effected between Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. The Greeks had demanded a compensation for this shifting of the balance of power from the Ottoman Empire and had prepared to enforce their demand by an appeal to arms. The Great Powers, however, interfered blockading the Piraeus to make Greece remain quiet. Trikoupis nevertheless believed that he could raise the value of Greek paper currency to par in a short time, and all his calculations were based upon that assumption. Unfortunately for him and his country, he was not able to make it happen. He was defeated at the 1885 general election, but in the following year he resumed office and again took up the cause of economic and financial reform. Anti-athletic Olympic Games Despite the Greek government receiving more than generous funding from Evangelis Zappas, back in 1856, for Athens to host athletic Olympic Games at the Panathinaiko Stadium, in perpetuity, members of the Greek government, notably Trikoupis and Stephanos Dragoumis, were resoundingly against them being athletic games. Trikoupis preferred an agro-industrial Olympics instead.Young, \\"The Modern Olympics - A Struggle for Revival\\", Chapter 5, p.63, The Johns Hopkins University Press (1996). The Zappeion, built to honor Zappas, was intended, by Trikoupis, to host agro-industrial competitions. Despite Trikoupis' anti- athletic politics, the Zappeion not only was the first indoor Olympic arena, hosting fencing in 1896, it also became the first Olympic Village in 1906. Coincidentally, Trikoupis died during the first week of the Athens 1896 Olympics. \\"Regretfully, we are bankrupt\\" His sixth turn in office (June 22, 1892 ‚Äì May 15, 1893) was a dramatic one. The country's treasury had been depleted by overspending and systemic corruption often caused by political campaigns in which parties promised massive spending programs. Trikoupis stood before parliament and made the most famous statement of his career: \\"Regretfully, we are bankrupt\\" (Greek: \\"ŒîœÖœÉœÑœÖœáœéœÇ ŒµœÄœÑœâœáŒµœçœÉŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩ\\"). The servicing of foreign loans was suspended, and all non-essential spending was cut. Trikoupis was again in power from November 11, 1893 until January 24, 1895. It was during that time that the planning for the 1896 Summer Olympics was begun. Trikoupis was skeptical about the games as he feared that the country could not shoulder the cost. He was convinced, eventually, to host them and made the needed arrangements. This would be his last term in office.  Resignation and death  Trikoupis tried to make terms with the creditors of his nation, but he failed in that too. The taxation measures he proposed to combat the country's bankruptcy aroused great hostility, and in January, 1895 he resigned. At the general election, four months later, he and his Modernist Party were astoundingly defeated by his main political rival, Theodoros Deligiannis, and Trikoupis did not even manage to win a seat in the parliament. This led to him resigning from politics and moving to Cannes.Old Parliament in Athens. In the 17 March 1896 elections, he was involuntarily nominated as an MP, and was elected back into Parliament, but Trikoupis never returned to Greece to assume his seat; he died in Cannes on 30 March 1896. He was buried in Athens. Legacy Trikoupis is considered as one of the greatest modern Greek politicians for his reformist and modernising programs as well as for the introduction of the dedilomeni principle. Roads in all major Greek cities, as well as the Rio‚ÄìAntirrio bridge, have been named after him. References Sources * Tsokapoulos, ŒíŒπŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± ŒßŒ±œÅŒπŒªŒ¨ŒøœÖ Œ§œÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÄŒ∑, Athens, 1896.

Joara is notable as a significant archaeological and historic site, where Mississippian and European artifacts have been found, in addition to an earthwork mound and remains of a 16th-century Spanish fort. The first European encounters came in the mid-16th century. In 1540 the party of Spanish conquistador Hernando De Soto recorded visiting this place. A later expedition in 1567 under Juan Pardo, another Spanish explorer, founded the first European settlement in the interior of the continent, establishing Fort San Juan at this site, followed by other forts to the west.David G. Moore, Robin A. Beck, Jr., and Christopher B. Rodning, \\"Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world\\" , Antiquity, Vol.78, No. 229, Mar. 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008 It is thought to be the first and the largest of the forts that Pardo established in an attempt to establish an overland road to the silver mines of Mexico, as the Spanish mistakenly believed the Appalachians were the same as mountains running through central Mexico. The Spanish survived here and at the other forts only about eighteen months before all but one man was killed by the Mississippians. Pardo made it back to Spain. British-related colonization did not begin here until the late 18th century. In the late 20th century, a Spanish account of the Pardo expedition was rediscovered and excavations were undertaken in this area beginning in the 1990s. After discovery of both European and Mississippian artifacts at this site in 2008, on July 22, 2013, archeologists announced having found evidence of the remains of Fort San Juan at Joara, including a moat that cut through an earthwork mound built by the Mississippians.John Noble Wilford, \\"Fort Tells of Spain‚Äôs Early Ambitions\\", New York Times, 22 July 2013, accessed 22 July 2013 History In the 21st century, archaeological finds from excavations have established evidence of both substantial Mississippian and briefly sustained Spanish 16th-century settlement in the interior of North Carolina. Joara was the site of Fort San Juan, established by the Juan Pardo expedition as the earliest Spanish outpost (1567-1568) in the interior of what is now North Carolina. This was 40 years before the English settlement at Jamestown and nearly 20 years before their \\"Lost Colony\\" at Roanoke Island. Located northwest of Morganton, the site has been excavated since the early 2000s in portions by the Upper Catawba Valley Archaeology Project. They hold regular open houses and educational events for the public during the summer excavation season. Established about AD 1000, Joara was the largest Mississippian-culture settlement within the current boundaries of North Carolina. In 1540 a party of Spanish conquistador Hernando De Soto encountered the people at this chiefdom site. It was still thriving in January 1567 when Spanish soldiers under command of Captain Juan Pardo arrived. Pardo established a base there for the winter, called the settlement Cuenca, and built Fort San Juan. After 18 months, the natives killed the soldiers at the fort and burned the structures down. That same year, 1568, the natives destroyed all six forts in the southeast interior and killed all but one of the 120 men Pardo had stationed in them. As a result, the Spanish ended their colonizing effort in the southeastern interior. Effects of European infectious diseases and conquest, and assimilation by larger native tribes, led to native abandonment of the settlement long before English explorers arrived in the region in the 17th century. De Soto's 1540 expedition noted the Chalaque already in the area at the time. According to some modern-day conjectures, the Cherokee, an Iroquoian-speaking people, migrated into western North Carolina from northern areas around the Great Lakes and used some of the former Mississippian village sites. English, Scots-Irish and German immigrants arrived in the 18th century. Settlement Joara is thought to have been settled some time after AD 1000 by the Mississippian culture, which built an earthwork mound at the site. It was a regional chiefdom, established on the west bank of Upper Creek and within sight of Table Rock, a dominant geographical feature of the area. The Joara natives comprised the eastern extent of Mississippian Mound Builder culture, which was centered in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. By the time of the first European contact by the Spanish with Native Americans in the foothills of the southern Appalachians, Joara had already grown to be the largest Mississippian-culture settlement in present-day North Carolina. The town served as the political center of a regional chiefdom that controlled many of the surrounding native settlements. Most contemporary scholars, following John Swanton, connect the various spellings of Joara with the Cheraw, a Siouan language-speaking people who later inhabited this region.Dr. Robin Beck, et al., \\"Joara and Fort San Juan: Colonialism and Household Practice at the Berry Site, North Carolina\\", Tulane University, National Science Foundation grant abstract, 7 Sept 2006 Cofitachequi and the neighboring Coosa chiefdoms were developed by ancestral Muskogean-speaking groups, who apparently claimed other areas as tributary. The Creek people are their descendants. The scholar T.H. Lewis at first associated the term Xualla with the modern Qualla Boundary and thought it was Cherokee. Most modern scholars no longer believe this because historically the French Broad is thought to be the boundary for the Cherokee. Charles Hudson alone argues that Joara may be a Cherokee name.Charles Hudson, 1998, Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun: Hernando De Soto... But the Cherokee were not moundbuilders and were not the first tribe to develop the site. Excavations have shown that the site was not Cherokee. Spanish exploration de Soto expedition route thru Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama. Based on Charles M. Hudson's map of 1997 =Hernando de Soto= In 1540, Hernando de Soto led a Spanish army up the eastern edge of the Appalachian mountains through present-day Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. This expedition recorded the first European contact with the people of Joara, which de Soto's chroniclers called Xuala.Charles Hudson, The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566-1568 (Tuscaloosa, Ala.: University of Alabama Press, 2005), 25. De Soto brought the queen of Cofitachequi province to Joara as an involuntary member of his entourage. The chroniclers also state that the queen claimed political dominion at this time over Joara province as well as the province of \\"Chalaque\\", and that the natives in both places respected her office. She managed to escape after reaching Joara. The Spanish departed to continue their exploration of Spanish Florida's interior, crossing westward over the Blue Ridge into present-day eastern Tennessee. They recorded visiting the Coosa chiefdom at Guasile. The Muskogee Creek people are considered descendants of the Coosa. =Captain Juan Pardo's first expedition= Detail of Joara (spelled Xuala) and neighboring villages on Chiaves's 1584 map of La Florida On December 1, 1566, Spanish Captain Juan Pardo and 125 men departed from Santa Elena, a center of Spanish Florida (located on present-day Parris Island, Beaufort County, South Carolina) under orders from Governor Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s to claim the interior for Spain. Pardo was to pacify the native inhabitants, convert them to Catholicism, and establish a route to Spanish silver mines near Zacatecas, Mexico. The Spanish thought Santa Elena was much closer to the mines than it actually was. To stay close to food sources on their journey through the foothills, the Spanish traveled northwest where there were friendly natives who would help to feed them. The small Spanish force stopped at Otari (near present-day Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina) and Yssa (near present-day Denver, Lincoln County), before arriving at Joara. Captain Pardo and his men arrived at Joara in January 1567. He renamed it Cuenca after his hometown of Cuenca, Spain. Snow in the Appalachian Mountains forced the Spanish to establish a winter base in the foothills at Joara. According to the records of the expedition, the explorers built a wooden fort at the north end of Joara and named it Fort San Juan. The fort became the first European settlement of present-day North Carolina, predating the first English colony at Roanoke Island by 18 years and Jamestown Virginia by 40 years. The Spanish kept a base in Fort San Juan and claimed sovereignty over several other settlements in the region, including Guaquiri (near present-day Hickory, Catawba County, North Carolina) and Quinahaqui (in present-day Catawba County, North Carolina). In February 1567, Captain Pardo established Fort Santiago at Guatari, a smaller town of Guatari (also called Wateree) natives located in present-day Rowan County, North Carolina. When Captain Pardo received word of a possible French invasion of Santa Elena (an early Spanish mission on the coast), he left a garrison of 30 soldiers to occupy Joara, and four soldiers and his chaplain, Sebasti√°n Montero, to occupy Guatari. He departed the area with the remainder of his force. Pardo appointed sergeant Hernando Moyano to command the force stationed at Fort San Juan. =Hernando Moyano's raids= During the spring of 1567, Hernando Moyano led a combined force of natives and Spanish north. The force attacked and burned the Chisca tribe's village of Maniateque (near present-day Saltville, Virginia) before returning to Joara. After resting and supplying his force, Moyano led his force to Guapere (thought to be on the upper Watauga River in present-day Tennessee). The Spanish and native force attacked and burned Guapere and marched west to Chiaha (also in present-day Tennessee). Moyano's force built a fort in Chiaha and waited for Captain Pardo to return. =Captain Juan Pardo's second expedition= Captain Juan Pardo returned to Fort San Juan in September 1567 to find the local inhabitants angered by the Spanish raids and demands for food, women, and canoes. The deaths from newly introduced infectious diseases was also destabilizing the community, causing resentment toward the Spanish. Instead of continuing his mission to Mexico, Captain Pardo left a garrison at Fort San Juan and marched the remainder of his troops westward to resupply Moyano's troops. Pardo first took his troops to the native village of Tocae (near present-day Asheville, North Carolina), then continued to Cauchi (near present-day Canton. The force continued on to Tanasqui and then to Chiaha, where they found Moyano's troops in need of supply. After aiding them, Pardo returned to Santa Elena. =Native uprising and end of Spanish colonization= Shortly after May 1568, news reached Santa Elena that the native population had burned the six Spanish forts established by Juan Pardo and killed all but one of the 120 Spanish men stationed in those garrisons. Pardo never returned to the area, and Spain ended all attempts to conquer and colonize the southeastern interior. Captain Pardo's narrative of his travels and settlement at Joara, written by his scribe Bandera, were discovered in the 1980s and translated into English. Together with the archeological evidence at Joara, they have contributed to a significant reassessment of the history of Spanish colonization in the interior of North America.Catherine Clabby, \\"Dig finds evidence of Spanish fort\\", News Observer, 1 Aug 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008 Abandonment At the time of the first Spanish contact, the native people of the area were identified by their villages of residence and were not part of large tribes but were part of regional cultures, in archeological terms. Mortality from European diseases and conquest and assimilation by large tribes, such as the Catawba and Cherokee, caused many of these smaller native bands to disappear as distinct groups. In 1670, English explorer John Lederer, departing from Fort Henry, explored deep into North Carolina. He described a large town he called \\"Sara\\", in the mountains that \\"received from the Spaniards the name of Suala\\". He said that the natives here mined cinnabar to make purple facepaint, and had cakes of salt. James Needham and Gabriel Archer also explored the entire area from Fort Henry in 1671, and described this town as \\"Sarrah\\". Scholars believe they were referring to a village likely several miles to the east of the original Joara. By the time most English, Moravian, Scots-Irish, and German settlers arrived in the area in the mid to late-18th century, Joara and many of the other ancient native towns in the region had been abandoned. The sites became overgrown and remains of structures and mounds were hidden. Although the sites of Joara and Fort San Juan were forgotten, local inhabitants found numerous native artifacts in certain areas of the upper Catawba River Valley. Unlike areas in which earthwork mounds were recognized and protected, during the early 1950s farmers bulldozed Joara's twelve-foot-high earthen platform mound to make way for cultivation. The location of the mound is now recognizable only as a two-foot rise in the field, but current owners vow to protect the site. Rediscovery at the Berry site During the 1960s and 1970s, several archaeological surveys were conducted in Burke County to determine possible locations of Joara and Fort San Juan. By the 1980s, archaeologists had reduced the number of possible locations and began limited excavations. These surveys and excavations showed that the upper Catawba River Valley did have a sizable native population during the 14th to 16th centuries. In 1986, a breakthrough occurred at the Berry excavation site (named for the family who own the property). Archaeologists discovered 16th-century Spanish artifacts. This evidence, supported by Bandera's recently rediscovered 16th-century narrative, caused a reevaluation of Pardo's route through the Upper Catawba Valley. The evidence suggested that the Berry Site is the location of Joara and Fort San Juan.Constance E. Richards, \\"Contact and Conflict\\", American Archaeologist, Spring 2008, p.14 The archaeological site has demonstrated the extent to which the Spanish attempted to establish a colonial foothold in the interior of the Southeast. Further excavations at the Berry site throughout the 1990s and 2000s yielded remains of native Joara settlement and burned Spanish huts, and more 16th-century Spanish artifacts. These included olive jar fragments, a spike, and a knife. In 2007, the team excavated Structure 5 and found a Spanish iron scale, as well as evidence of Spanish building techniques. These artifacts were not trade goods but objects used by the Spanish themselves in settlements. Joara is particularly interesting for revealing the interaction between Native Americans and Spanish, who were relatively few in number and depended on the natives for food.Martha Quillin, \\"Trove from Fort San Juan delights archaeologists\\" , The News Observer, 31 Jan 2008, accessed 26 Jun 2008 In 2009 archaeologists familiar with the area concluded this is definitely the site of Joara and Fort San Juan. Evidence supports documented Spanish settlement of 1567-1568, as well as the natives' burning of the fort. The materials found have required a reassessment of the history of European contact with Native Americans.David Moore, Robin Beck and Christopher Rodning, \\"In Search of Fort San Juan: Sixteenth Century Spanish and Native Interaction in the North Carolina Piedmont\\" , Warren Wilson College Archaeology Home Page, 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008, In July 2013, archeologists reported finding evidence of the remains of the fort itself at the site, including the remnants of burned palisades and what appeared to be the main structure within the fort.\\"First New World Fort Was Spain‚Äôs\\", John Wilford, New York Times, July 22, 2013 See also * Xualae * List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition * Southeastern Ceremonial Complex * List of Mississippian sites * Bussell Island Citations References  * Clabby, Catherine (Aug. 1, 2004). \\"Dig finds evidence of Spanish fort\\".

It is located 50 kilometers south of Addis Ababa by road, across the Awash River from the village of Melka Awash. Three waterfalls lie downstream of the bridge across the Awash here, which provides access south to Butajira.Philip Briggs, Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide, 3rd edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2002), p. 374  History of research  The site, discovered by Gerard Dekker in 1963, was surveyed by G√©rard Bailloud in 1964, and then systematically explored by a French mission directed by Jean Chavaillon (1965-1982 / 1993-1995). Since 1999, an Italian mission directed by Marcello Piperno for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the University of Rome ‚ÄúLa Sapienza‚Äù has worked at the site in agreement with the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage of the Ethiopian Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Oromia Culture and Tourism Bureau.  Archaeological sequences  Archaeologists have uncovered over 30 occupation sites at Melka Kunture. The finds are dated by volcanic depositions left by eruptions of Mount Zuqualla, northeast of Melka Kunture.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 8 The sequence begins with the Oldowan site of Karre, about 1.7 million years old, which can be correlated to level B of Gombore I, on the right bank of the Awash. A probably contemporaneous Oldowan site is documented at Garba IV. The magneto-stratigraphic sequence of Jaramillo lies between Tuff A, which overlies the Oldowan sites, and Tuff B, which is dated between 1.0 and 0.84 million years ago. Some important sites, such as Garba XII and Simbiro III, datable to a transitional phase from the late Oldowan to the Early Acheulean (Garba XII) or to an archaic phase of the Acheulean (Simbiro), also lie within this chronological span. A later phase of the African Acheulean is well represented by several sites in the area of Gombore II (dated to about 0.8 mya). The latest Acheulean site is Garba I, dated to ca. 0.5 mya, while the end of this long sequence is represented, at Melka Kunture, by the site of Garba III, approximately dated to 0.2 mya, which can be regarded as a transitional site towards the Middle Stone Age. Some of the above-listed levels yielded hominid remains: a humerus fragment of H. cf. erectus at Gombore I; a hemimandible of a H. cf. erectus child at Garba IV; two H. erectus skull fragments at Gombore II; and three archaic H. sapiens skull fragments at Garba III. The East African Later Stone Age is poorly documented at Melka Kunture, being represented so far by some finds at Wofi and Kella. A little less than 7 km from Melka Kunture, in a site known as Balchit, are imposing outcrops of obsidian. As recent analyses from samples from several sites in Melka Kunture bear out, these outcrops were used, ever since the earliest Oldowan phases, as an important source of raw material. The exploitation of obsidian in the Melka region went on until historical times, leaving numerous and extensive accumulations of tens of thousands of blades, cores, and scars of this volcanic rock.  Exhibits  A museum was built at the site by the Oromia Culture and Tourism Commission with financial assistance from the European Community, consisting of four buildings with exhibits‚Äîone on prehistoric Africa, another on geology and volcanology, a third on paleoanthropology, the fourth on the prehistory of Melka Kunture. There is also an \\"Open Air Museum,\\" which displays the excavation of two Acheulean sites that have been dated to 0.8 million years BP.\\"Melka Kunture - Home\\", University of Rome, \\"La Sapienza\\", Dipartimento di Scienze dell‚ÄôAntichit√†.

Etymology  The ideographs for mean \\"blind\\" and \\"woman.\\" The kanji are so because the individual ideograph for already existed. is most likely derived from , which also means \\"blind woman\\" ( is a formal second-person pronoun). Although the term can be found in medieval records, other terms such as , were also in use (especially in written records) until the modern era. In spoken language, the term is usually suffixed by an honorific: , , , etc.  Organizations  From the Edo period (1600‚Äì1868), goze organized themselves in a number of ways. Few large-scale organizations have been found in urban areas, though during the nineteenth century some documents speak of a goze association in the city of Edo. In Osaka and some regional towns, goze were sometimes informally linked to pleasure quarters, where they were called to perform their songs at parties. Goze organizations developed most in rural areas and continued to exist in Niigata (once known as Echigo) and Nagano prefectures well into the twentieth century (the last important active goze, , died in 2005 at age 105). From the Edo period onward, other goze groups were found from Kyushu in the south to the Yamagata and Fukushima prefectures in the north. Blind women farther north tended to become shamans (known as , , or ) rather than goze. Large and important groups were especially active in the Kant≈ç and surrounding areas, in what are today Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Shizuoka, Yamanashi, and Tokyo-to. Other groups were formed in the Nagano and Gifu prefectures, and the Aichi prefecture farther south. In addition to the well-known groups of Niigata prefecture, groups existed in other areas along the western seaboard, including Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui prefectures. Suzuki Sh≈çei (1996 and elsewhere) divides the organizations of Echigo goze into three main types: * goze organizations such as the one in Takada (today the city of J≈çetsu), in which a limited number of goze houses (17 in the early twentieth-century) were concentrated in the city and in which each house was led by a master teacher who passed on the rights to her position and property to her top (or favorite) student after her death. Girls who wished to become goze had to move to the city and enter the house (fictitious family) of the goze teacher. Sometimes they were adopted by the teacher as a daughter. * Organizations such as the one centered on Nagaoka, in which goze remained in the countryside and often their own home, after completing their apprenticeship with a goze elsewhere. These goze teachers were loosely linked to one another by their relation to the goze head in Nagaoka (a position assumed by a goze who, after becoming the head, assumed the name Yamamoto Goi). Once each year the goze of the Nagaoka group assembled at their headquarters, the house of Yamamoto Goi, to celebrate a ceremony known as in which their history and the rules of their organization were read out loud. They deliberated on what to do about members who had broken rules, ate a celebratory meal, and performed for one another. * Organizations such as the one found in Iida (Nagano prefecture), in which the position of head rotated among members. Rules Goze organizations existed to allow blind women a degree of independence in pursuing their careers as musicians (or in some cases, massage). The rules that governed Echigo goze were said to have been decreed by ancient emperors, but no copy of these rules earlier than the late seventeenth century have been found. The central rules governing goze behavior was to obey teachers, be humble towards donors, and not engage in activities that might contravene the morality of the feudal society in which goze operated. Although not stipulated in detail, perhaps the most important rule was celibacy. If such an offense was detected, it easily resulted in the expulsion of a goze from the group. These stipulations were made and enforced for several reasons: if a goze did have a lover or if she married, she would have financial support from an outside source, and thus needed no further charity. Furthermore, the stipulations were developed to protect the image of the goze group as a legitimate non-profit organization and protect it from the appearing to be, or devolving into, a prostitution ring. Rules were also necessary in part because many goze spent a good part of the year on the road, touring from village to village and depending on farmers to allow them to spend the night and use their houses as makeshift concert halls. Reputation and recognition as an officially sanctioned, upright occupation was thus of great importance in making the career of the goze possible. In addition, because Edo-period society was rife with discrimination against women, itinerants, musicians, and anyone with a visual disability, membership in an association that was recognized as legitimate and honorable was an important credential which allayed suspicions that the woman might be a wandering vagabond or prostitute. Honj≈ç Hidetar≈ç (born 1945) and Kosugi Makiko (born circa 1940) were two of many renowned professional folk song () performers who, in their childhoods, were criticized by their parents for \\"acting like goze\\". Songs The repertory of most goze has been lost, but songs of goze from the Niigata, Nagano, Saitama, and Kagoshima prefectures have been recorded. The vast majority of these recordings are from what is today Niigata prefecture. The repertory of Niigata (Echigo) goze can be divided into several distinct categories: * : Long strophic songs in a 7-5 syllable meter, often based on archaic tales and sometimes with a Buddhist message. The melody to which these texts were sung was most likely a variant of the Echigo folk song . These songs were probably created during the eighteenth century, though elements of the texts are far older. They were usually only transmitted from one goze to another. * : Long strophic songs in a 7-7- syllable meter. Texts usually feature double love-suicides or other melodramatic themes. The melody to which these texts were sung is a variant of the Echigo folk song . did not appear until the mid-nineteenth century. Although they were a highly typical goze song, they were sometimes also sung by other types of performers. * : A functional designation applying to any song used by goze as they made their way from door to door collecting donations. Goze usually sang whatever inhabitants of a given area wished to hear, but in the Niigata goze repertory, some unique songs were used exclusively for such purposes. * : Rural songs, usually with no known composer, learned by the populace informally. Many types of folk songs constituted an important part of the goze repertory, and were especially useful in livening up parties when goze were summoned to perform. * \\"Classical\\" or \\"semi-classical\\" songs: Most goze also knew songs belonging to genres such as , , , or . Such songs were often learned from professional musicians outside the goze community. * To please their customers, goze would also sing various popular songs. Sugimoto Kikue of Takada (1898‚Äì1983), who was designated a Living National Treasure in 1971, added to her repertoire in 1922 two recently composed popular songs (both using a folk-song-style pentatonic scale), and .

Rations had to be stout, durable, simple, sturdy and had to survive without refrigeration for long periods of time. Typically each ration was served in the field in tin boxes, and cooked near the battlefield. The mess tin was known as a han-gou. The rations issued by the Imperial Japanese Government, usually consisted of rice with barley, meat or fish, vegetables, pickled vegetables, umeboshi, shoyu sauce, miso or bean paste, and green tea.http://www.combinedfleet.com/guadoil1.htm A typical field ration would have 1¬Ω cups of rice, with barley. The reason why rice was issued with barley was to combat nutritional deficiencies such as beriberi. Often, soldiers would forage for fresh fruit to provide vitamins. Typically ¬º cup of canned tuna, or sausages, and/or squid would be cooked from either captured locations or hunting in the nearby area. Preserved foods from Japan typically were issued sparingly. Other foods issued: 1 ¬º cups of canned cabbage, coconut, sweet potato, burdock, lotus root, taro, bean sprouts, peaches, mandarin oranges, lychee or beans. 3 teaspoons of pickled radish (typically daikon), pickled cucumber, umeboshi, scallions and ginger added flavor to the rations. Sometimes less than an ounce of dried seaweed, was issued for making sushi in the field, or beer and/or sake was issued to help boost morale.  Field Rations  Two types of rations were issued, normal rations for use at mealtimes and special rations to be carried by the soldier  Normal Type Ration  A single ration of this type includes the following: 660 g (23.28 oz) of rice; 209 g (7.37 oz) of barley; 209 g (7.37 oz) of raw meat; 600 g (21.16 oz) of vegetables; 60 g (2.11 oz) of pickles small quantities of flavoring, salt, and sugar.  Special Type Ration  A single ration includes the following: 580 g (20.46 oz) of rice (probably polished); 230 g (8.113 oz) of biscuit; 150 g (5.3 oz) of canned meat (or 60 g (2.1 oz) of dried meat); 120 g (4.23 oz) of dried vegetables; 31 g (1.09 oz) of dried plums, and small quantities of salt, sugar, and sometimes a can of beer made from rice called sake.  Emergency Rations  Five days rations were issued to each soldier for emergency use The ration consisted of; a. Half a pound of hard candy. b. Can of tea. c. Package of compact food. d. Vitamin pills. e. Package of hardtack. f. Small sack of rice In Burma the Japanese used two types of emergency rations. One was known as the \\"A\\" scale and the other as the \\"B\\" scale. Each soldier carried rations for three days on the \\"A\\" scale and for one day on the \\"B\\" scale. Neither of the rations was to be eaten except on orders of the commanding officer when the unit was separated from its supply column. Each ration under the \\"A\\" scale consisted of about 1 pound and 3 ounces of rice (enough for two meals) and one small can of mixed beef and vegetables. The soldier usually cooked the rice in a small bucket which he carried for this purpose. The \\"B\\" scale ration consisted of three paper bags of hard biscuits (enough for three meals).

The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 3,197 of whom 1,582 were males and 1,615 were females. It is the main town in Wondo Genet woreda. Wondo Genet is known for its hot springs and is surrounded by primary Ethiopian forests. It is home to an arboretum and a College of Forestry which was founded in 1977 with Swedish assistance.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 4 June 2008) Also located in this resort town is the Essential Oils Research Sub Center, where spices, aromatic and medicinal plants are conserved and their qualities researched.  History  The Swedish Philadelphia Church Mission opened a mission in this town in 1961, which included a medical clinic. The Wondo Genet hotel was established in 1964, on land used as recreation site for the royal family until 1975. Emperor Haile Selassie bequeathed its name, meaning \\"Wondo Paradise\\", in reference to the beautiful panorama with a rich endowment of forests, wildlife and abundant water. Title to the hotel was transferred to the then Hotels Corporation, and currently it is a subsidiary of the Wabe Shebelle Hotels Enterprise. The hotel facilities include 54.4 ha area of land and possesses 40 bed rooms, restaurant and a bar, as well as swimming pools and access to the hot springs. The Wendo Genet earthquake of 1983 was among the most significant in Ethiopia in the 20th century. Its magnitude has not been determined, but was severe enough that the frightened inhabitants gathered at the Ethiopian Orthodox church below the hotel to sing and pray the whole day and the whole night. A later disaster was a complex of forest fires which erupted in 17 places in southern Ethiopia on 10 February 2000 including the vicinity of the College. On 3 April 2008, 18 people were killed in clashes near Wondo Genet between the Guji Oromo and Sidama people over ownership to grazing and farm land.\\"Land clashes kill 18 in Ethiopia\\" Australian Broadcasting Corporation website, posted 9 April 2008 (accessed 1 June 2008)  Notes  Category:Populated places in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region ","title":"Wondo Genet"},{"id":"2189825","text":"is a Japanese visual kei rock band formed in January 1997.

It was created by a succession of storm surges in the 14th and 15th centuries, including the St. Elizabeth's flood (1404) and the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421). For a long time the Braakman was a natural barrier between east and west Zeelandic Flanders, and also access to the ports of Boekhoute, Philippine, Axel and Sas van Gent. Over the centuries it steadily spread, drowning at least 15 villages between 1200 and 1601. Then, people fought back. Successive empolderings shrank the Braakman to a remnant, which was finally closed off from the sea in 1952. During the North Sea flood of 1953, this dam proved its worth: it resisted the flood and prevented flooding in the hinterland. The remaining body of water is used for recreation, and part of its seaward end was made into the Braakmanhaven port area.

A number of these miracles have been recorded in a hagiography published in Cairo in the 1920s, entitled Rabi\` al-Qulub. Although this town is now within the homelands of the Oromo people, it has continued to be the destination of approximately 50,000 pilgrims from Muslim Ethiopia twice a year during the Muslim months of Hajj and Rabi' al-Awwal.J. Spencer Trimingham, Islam in Ethiopia (Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, 1952), pp. 253-256. The first pilgrimage is to celebrate his birth, the second his death. They traditionally carry cleft sticks known as \\"Oulle Sheikh Hussein\\", which are too small to serve as walking sticks and are not utilized for any practical purpose. Once they arrive at the shrine, the pilgrims take their turns entering the saint's tomb by crawling through a small doorway.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 3 December 2007) The extensive religious complex dedicated to the saint includes the town and the nearby valley of Kachamsare. In the 18th century, Emir \`Abd al-Shakur ibn Yusuf of Harar constructed a shrine to the Baghdadi saint \`Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani near the tomb of Sheikh Hussein, inside the shrine compound. A graveyard has also been consecrated as part of the complex. Other landmarks of the complex include the pond of Dinkiro, 300 meters south of the mosque, built in dry stone masonry; associated with the pond is a spring with \\"miraculous\\" water. At the entrance of the holy area are two wild fig trees called kiltu (identified as Ficus sycomorus) in the Oromo language.

The paper is published Monday through Friday during the academic year and once during the summer. Available at newsstands across campus and downtown Madison, Wisconsin and published on the web, it has a print circulation of 6,000. The Badger Herald, Inc. is a nonprofit corporation run entirely by University of Wisconsin-Madison students and funded solely by advertising revenue. The Board of Directors, which operates the company, is composed of nine UW students and three non-voting advisers, including noted First Amendment expert Donald Downs and former Republican congressional candidate John Sharpless. The staff consists of nearly 100 students. The office is located off-campus at 152 W. Johnson St. Suite 202. The paper is printed by Capital Newspapers, Inc., home of the Wisconsin State Journal and The Capital Times. History First Badger Herald offices at 638 State St., second floor, in 1988 The Badger Herald was founded in 1969 by a group of four students seeking a conservative alternative to the UW‚ÄìMadison's primary student newspaper, The Daily Cardinal, which editorialized against the Vietnam War and had close ties to leaders of the radical campus protest movement. When anti-war activists detonated a truck bomb outside the University's Army Math Research Center on August 24, 1970, damaging several campus buildings and killing a post doc physics researcher, The Daily Cardinal editorially supported the bombers, saying \\"If Robert Fassnacht had died in Vietnam ... he would be a line in a news story ‚Äì a number. And that is the reality that some of us have already died to change will struggle to change.\\" While such attitudes were widespread on college campuses at the time, the Daily Cardinal‚Äîalong with other college newspapers‚Äîhelped coordinate and encourage activism against military research. The Daily Cardinal would later become more moderate in response to pressure from local media, the UW Board of Regents, staff members leaving, declining advertising revenue, and the radicalism of the 1960s and early 1970s dying down around the country. Still, The Badger Herald formed in direct response to the then-radicalism of The Daily Cardinal and the campus. After several months of fund-raising, scrounging for desks and typewriters, and renting a walk-up office two blocks from the University's Bascom Hill at 538 State Street, the first issue of The Badger Herald was published on September 10, 1969. In the late-1970s, the Herald moved to 550 State Street. When the Herald moved to its office at 326 W. Gorham Street in 1998, the editors kept much of the furniture, including the original desks and homemade light board. Their offices are currently located 152 W. Johnson St. Suite 202. Founding editor Patrick S. Korten received financial support for the new paper from nationally known conservative writer William F. Buckley after it ran into financial trouble in 1971. Buckley raised money for the struggling paper by giving a fund-raising dinner speech in Madison, with proceeds going to the paper. It is the only speech Buckley ever gave free of charge. During the 1970s the paper remained solvent through advertising sales to businesses on the populous UW campus. The Herald has consistently refused offers of a subsidy from the university in order to maintain its editorial independence. During that era, the paper maintained a consistently conservative editorial policy - one that has since been abandoned - on a campus that was considered so liberal that it was called \\"The Berkeley of the Midwest\\". The paper received regional attention and sparked a series of campus protests in 1976 and 1978 by publishing controversial opinion pieces titled, \\"Mao, Death of a Tyrant\\", \\"Top Commie Bites Dust\\", \\"Can Africans Rule Themselves?\\" and \\"Confronting the Lavender Menace or: The Case Against Homosexuality\\". The Herald was the first newspaper in the state of Wisconsin to publish the work of Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist, Jeff MacNelly, having signed the exclusive area rights from his syndicate in 1976. The Badger Herald was first published as a weekly newspaper, went twice-weekly in 1974 and went daily in 1987. When the paper moved from weekly to daily, \\"its executive board calmed the editorial page's conservative voice,\\" bringing it generally into line with the left-of-center political stance of The Daily Cardinal. In 2005, the short-lived Mendota Beacon attempted to fill the void left by the Herald's leftward shift by providing a conservative voice on campus. Early on it established itself as a serious presence on campus, and by the early 1990s, overtook the much-older Daily Cardinal, in circulation and advertising revenue. By 1992, the once upstart conservative alternative campus newspaper had become the dominant newspaper on the 40,000 student University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison campus. Today, the \\"Badger Herald\\" is still perceived as more conservative than the rival Daily Cardinal. In 2001 The Badger Herald published an advertisement by controversial conservative writer David Horowitz that argued against reparations for slavery. Weathering several protests and disruptions in circulation, the Herald refused to apologize for publishing the advertisement. After a flurry of national news coverage, the paper's status as an independent student newspaper stood firm. The Herald‚Äôs position was lauded in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and the Wisconsin State Journal. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel editorialized that the Herald is \\"living proof that the Constitution is a living document\\". On February 13, 2006 The Badger Herald editorial board published a controversial cartoon that depicted Muhammad. In the accompanying column titled \\"Sacred Images, Sacred Rights\\", the board said it considered the cartoon \\"offensive\\" but also deemed it \\"clearly newsworthy\\" and a \\"vehicle of facilitation in the grand marketplace of ideas\\".Badger Herald Editorial Board. \\"Sacred images, sacred rights.\\" The Badger Herald, February 13, 2006.http://badgerherald.com/oped/2006/02/13/sacred_images_sacred.php In May 2008, a controversial cartoon of David Horowitz, originally published in the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee school newspaper, the UW‚ÄìM Post, that depicted the conservative writer who is of Jewish-American heritage with a hooked nose, was republished on the front page of The Badger Herald. The coverage of this article, that was accompanied by the controversial cartoon, followed the pattern of The Herald's decision to reprint images considered taboo. In February 2010, the Herald accepted a text ad on its website from Bradley Smith with the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust, a Holocaust denial organization. The Herald Editor in Chief at the time, Jason Smathers, defended the decision based on the belief that the community was strong enough to see and reject the ad. After a strong push back from the university community, of which at least 25 percent is Jewish, the newspaper said it regretted the pain the decision caused but ultimately kept the ad up for the entirety of its month-long run. In March 2010,the United States Holocaust Museum used the newspaper's decision in a form letter soliciting donations from members. In 2013, The Badger Herald became an \\"online-first\\" publication, with print editions twice weekly.Dan Reimold. \\"Wisconsin‚Äôs Badger Herald Going Digital-First, Dropping to Twice a Week in Print\\". College Media Matters, April 3, 2013. In 2015, the paper announced it would cut down its print editions to a weekly tabloid product. Comics In 1976, when numerous newspapers nationally including the Madison Capital Times declined to run a series of Garry Trudeau's \\"Doonesbury\\" comic strips because of their controversial content, The Badger Herald negotiated with the syndicate and was the only paper regionally to print the cartoons. The Badger Herald today publishes a comics page one day a week in its print edition. Long-running comics include White Bread & Toast (since at least 2004) and Rocky the Herald Comics Raccoon, about a witty, whiskey-swilling roustabout known for his sarcastic observations.

The brand has been available intermittently through successive decades. Initially, the manufacturer was based in Cobham, Surrey, England, from 1925 to 1933, then in Chelsea, London, England, from 1933 to 1938 and finally in Virginia Water, Surrey, England, from 1946 to 1950. More recently, the name was revived for the Invicta S1 sports car produced between 2004 and 2012. First incarnation 4¬Ω litre long wheelbase NLC, 1932 4¬Ω litre Meadows engine in an S-type This manufacturer was founded by Noel Macklin with Oliver Lyle of the sugar family providing finance. Assembly took place in Macklin's garage at his home at Fairmile Cottage on the main London to Portsmouth road in Cobham, Surrey. Macklin had previously tried car making with Eric-Campbell & Co Limited and his own Silver Hawk Motor Company Limited The Invicta cars were designed to combine flexibility, the ability to accelerate from virtual standstill in top gear, with sporting performance. With the assistance of William (Willie) Watson, his mechanic from pre-World War I racing days, a prototype was built on a Bayliss-Thomas frame with Coventry Simplex engine in the stables of Macklin's house on the western side of Cobham. =SC and LC Chassis= The first production car, the 1925 2¬Ω litre used a Meadows straight six, overhead-valve engine and four-speed gearbox in a chassis with semi elliptical springs all round and cost from ¬£595. Two different chassis lengths were available, SC and LC to cater for the customer's choice of bodywork. As demand grew a lot of the construction work went to Lenaerts and Dolphens in Barnes, London but final assembly and test remained at Fairmile. The engine grew to 3 litres in 1926 and 4¬Ω litres in late 1928. =NLC and A Type Chassis= The larger engine was used in the William Watson designed 1929 4¬Ω litre NLC chassis available in short or long versions, but the less expensive A Type replaced the NLC in 1930. 4¬Ω litre S-type from 1931 =S-type= In 1930 the S-type was launched at the London Motor Show. Still using the 4¬Ω litre Meadows engine but in a low chassis slung under the rear axle. About 75 were made. =1¬Ω litre= In an attempt to widen the market appeal the 1¬Ω litre straight-six overhead-cam Blackburne engined 12/45 L-type was announced in 1932. It was a large car with its wheelbase and proved too heavy for the available power needing a 6:1 rear axle ratio. It was available with a preselector gearbox as an option and most had coachwork by Carbodies. The supercharged 12/90 of 1933 increased the available power from 45 to but few were made and a proposed twin-cam 12/100 never got beyond a prototype. =Success= Violete Cordery, July 1927 Sporting success for Invicta often came via Violette Cordery, who was Noel Macklin's sister-in-law. She won the half mile sprint at the West Kent Motor Club meeting at Brooklands in 1925 driving a 2.7 litre. In March 1926 Cordery was part of a team of six drivers that set multiple long distance records at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in Italy. They covered 10,000 miles at 56.47 mph, and 15,000 miles at 55.76 mph. In July 1926 at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlh√©ry track, Paris, they covered 5000 miles at 70.7 mph, taking over 70 hours of day and night driving, supervised by the Royal Automobile Club. Cordery was twice awarded the Dewar Trophy, latterly in 1929 for driving in 30,000 minutes (20.8 days) at Brooklands, averaging 61.57 mph.See: Motor Sport, November 1926, Page 168.See: Motor Sport, January 1952, Page 21. Between February and July 1927 Cordery drove an Invicta around the world, accompanied by a nurse, a mechanic, and an RAC observer. They covered 10,266 miles in five months at 24.6 mph, crossing Europe, Africa, India, Australia, the United States and Canada. In 1930 Donald Healey gained a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally, and won the event outright in 1931 with an S Type, having started from Stavanger. S. C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Davis had a spectacular accident in an S-type at Brooklands in 1931.See: Motor Sport, May 1931, Page 334. Raymond Mays held the Brooklands Mountain Circuit Class Record in 1931 and 1932, and the outright Shelsley Walsh Sports Car Record in the latter year. =End of production= Car production seems to have finished in 1935. Noel Macklin went on to found Railton, who used the Cobham buildings to make their cars after Invicta moved to Chelsea in 1933. An attempted revival using Delage and Darracq components failed to get off the ground. Following the collapse of an attempted sale the court made an order for the compulsory winding up of Invicta Cars Limited on 3 May 1938.News in Brief.

Company No. 02342199 was registered again in 1989 by Christopher Browning, an Invicta enthusiast who was involved in the restoration and running of Invicta cars designed between 1925 and 1935. The purpose of the company was ‚Äì and still is today ‚Äì to record and preserve the heritage of the company name and provide a reference point for all the Invicta cars that are either being restored or are running on the road today. 2004‚Äì12 Invicta S1 Invicta S1 silver In the early 2000s, the marque was resurrected yet again, producing the Invicta S1, at the Invicta Car Company factory in Chippenham, Wiltshire, England owned by Michael Bristow who acquired the brand in 1980. The S1 was launched at the 2002 British International Motor Show. The car, designed in cooperation with Chris Marsh & Leigh Adams, was powered by , producing and with a claimed top speed of and acceleration to 60mph in 5 seconds. A supercharged 5.0-litre V8 engines supplied by Ford's Special Vehicle Team (SVT) in America which can be tuned by Invicta to deliver up to at 6000 rpm and of torque at 4500 rpm, which has a claimed top speed of upwards of . The range prices started at ¬£106,000 and finished at ¬£160,000, or about $156,000 to $236,000 US dollars (December 2008). The car features AP Racing 6-pot (front) and 4-pot (rear) main braking system with cross drilled and race spec ventilated disc brakes, an independent hand brake system by Brembo, fully adjustable shock absorbers with race double wishbone suspension, a BTR Hydratrak race limited-slip differential, 50/50 weight distribution and a space frame tubular chassis and roll cage. In April 2012 Westpoint Car Company, formerly the Invicta Car Company, was wound-up by the court as a result of a ¬£40,000 unpaid debt following diminishing interest in expensive cars. Invicta Motors changed its name to Westpoint Car Company shortly before it was dissolved to save the Invicta brand being linked to yet another financial failure. The dispossessed owner, Michael Bristow, said it was the fourth financial collapse in the marque's history.

According to tradition Sof Omar was the name of a Muslim holy man who lived in the area and Ayiew the name of his daughter. Maco and Holuca are local names for 'name' and 'cave', respectively. Long a religious centre, it is sacred both to Islam and the local Oromo traditional religion. The caves are known for their many pillars, particularly in the 'Chamber of Columns'.  History of exploration  The explorer Arthur Donaldson Smith recorded his visit to the cave in 1894.Donaldson-Smith.

In 1967, Eric Robson, Chris Clapham and Kabir Ahmed explored and surveyed the cave, recording 8 km of passage.Robson, G.E. \\"Caves of Sof Omar\\", Geographical Journal, 133 (1967), p. 344-349 Following this the Ethiopian Tourist Board published a brochure about the cave.Robson, G.E. (1967)The Caves of Sof Omar, Ethiopian Tourist Organization, Addis Ababa Although the area was not easily accessible and the organized adventure tourist industry did not yet exist, a few intrepid visitors made the trip to the then remote cave. In February 1971 Professor Th√©odore Monod of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in France, Bill Morton (ex Manchester University Speleological Society caver), a geologist at Haile Selassie I University, and Ato Mezmure Hailemeskale recorded another 1 km new passages to the known cave.Monod, T and Morton, W.H. (1972) Annales de Speleologie, tome 27, fasc, 1 In the same year Dick Ashford and Malcolm Largen of Haile Selassie University made a study of some of the bats in the cave. In 1972, a British Expedition to Ethiopia arrived with a team which included Dick Ramsden and Tim Renvoize (Preston Caving Club), Simon Amatt (Birmingham Plytechnic Karabiner Club), Dave Catlin (University of Bradford Pothole Club), Paul Ramsden (Whernside Manor Scout Centre), Terry Raynor (9th and 12th Royal Lancers) and Steve Worthington (Sheffield University Speleological Society). With some initial help from Bill Morton the group made a systematic exploration and survey of the Sof Omar caves and published a full report of their findings in Transactions of the Cave Research Group of Great Britain.Catlin, D. (Compiler) (1973) The Caves of Ethiopia: Report of the 1972 British Speleological Expedition to Ethiopia, Cave Research Group of Great Britain Vol 15. No 3, pp 120-136 The team discovered of new passages, bringing the survey total to .  Topography  Approaching from Goro, at Sof Omar the scrubby bush steeply drops 90 m into a canyon. The Web river makes its way from the high Bale Mountains through a wide outcrop of Anatole limestone to the cave. In earlier times the river made a sharp left meander. At some point the limestone dissolved producing a series of phreatic passages, which became big enough to capture the whole flow of the Web river. Eventually the river abandoned the meander, creating a dry valley running from the cave sink at Ayiew Maco to the resurgence at Holuca. Sof Omar village is situated close to Ayiew Maco in the dry valley. Infill into the valley makes it rise to a high point of about 45 m above the Web, before it drops away to a pebble beach downstream of Holuca. The other dominant feature is a large shakehole wide and deep and found on the basalt plateau directly above the cave.  Description  The cave is formed along a network of joints: one set runs approximately north to south and the other east to west. This zig-zag of passages runs in an approximately southeasterly direction. Sof Omar has 42 entrances, but generally only four are useful for gaining entrance: *Two upstream Village Entrances (one to the east and one to the west of the village) *The Tourist Entrance downstream from the Holuca Resurgence at a point where the abandoned meander forming the dry valley rejoins the Web river *A right bank entrance downstream of Holuca accessing the Deep South part of the Clapham's Climb Series. Entering the cave via either of the Village Entrances the visitor passes a shrine used by the locals. The Ayiew Maco Series is a set of interconnecting passages of varying in width between 1 m and 10 m. Several can be passed through to the pebble beach on the left bank of the river. A less complex series of passages exists on the right bank. These probably connected to those on the left bank until severed by the vadose action of the Web cutting the river passage deeper. The Web river disappearing into the Ayiew Maco entrance of Sof Omar Caves. The dry valley, Sof Omar Village and Village Entrances are off to the left. Safari Straight looking across Ford 5, in the distance the river turns sharply right at the Great Dome. The boulder slope is the start of Molossadie passage. The passage at the pebble beach is about 40 m wide‚Äîthe widest passage in the cave. At the downstream end of the beach the river disappears between two columns. The continuation crosses the Web at Ford 1 and follows the figure-eight passage until the river is reached again at Ford 2. The river meanders down this 15 m wide, 20 m high rectangular passage for 300 m. The way onward involves crossing and re-crossing the river from cobble beach to cobble beach at Fords 2, 3, 4 and 5. Small passages exist on both sides. The beach ends after Ford 5 under the 50 m high Great Dome. On the opposite bank a steep rise leads to Molossadie Passage. The deep, short Ford 6, Ford 7 and Ford 8 lead to a cobble beach and the entrance into the Chamber of Columns. Exiting Ford 6 on the left bank it is possible to enter the Railway Tunnel passage, which offers an alternative route into the Molossadie passage and bypasses Fords 7 and 8 into the Chamber of Columns. Chamber of Columns: a series of interconnected phreatic arches; the mud marks indicate the level of flooding during the rainy season. Big Rapids: created by the shakehole collapse and subsequent erosion by the underground river. The Chamber of Columns is a unique feature in the world of caves. It looks like a wide passage leaving the Web before sweeping back to the river about 100 m downstream. The passage circumnavigates a cluster of thick columns densely packed in the centre of chamber. The Railway Tunnel and Molossadie Passage enter the chamber from the north. The river passage continues from the Chamber of Columns meandering for about 200 m to the Big Rapids. This striking feature is formed from a jumble of huge boulders, well worn by the actions of the river. The river passage continues around a curve for about 250 m before flowing around a massive boulder into the sunlight at the Holuca Resurgence. The Web continues running through a canyon. About 250 m downstream the dry valley appears on the left bank. The left side of the canyon from the resurgence to the dry valley is riddled with passages breaking out into the canyon walls, forming many of the unusable entrances to the cave. Most of these are small passages exposed as the river cut its way down. The exception is the 25 m wide Great Hall that follows the north ‚Äì south joint pattern breaking into the canyon at the resurgence. Hidden at the end of the Great Hall behind boulders is the hard-to-find Chameleon Passage. This runs along the east‚Äìwest joint pattern. Some small passages lead from Chameleon to Blank Passage and back to the Big Rapids. Several small passages run from Blank Passage to Boulder Chokes. The Holuca Resurgence: The fallen boulder is the size of a room. It shows the severity of the collapse in the cave. The lack of erosion indicates this was a relatively recent event. The area surrounded by the river, Great Hall, Chameleon and Blank Passage, contains a criss-cross labyrinth of passages. Two of the most significant, Bill's Passage and Tautology Passage, run between the river and the Great Hall. These are high rift passages, and climbing them gives access to the 35 m long Balcony that overlooks the Big Rapids 7 m below. Running parallel to the Great Hall and interconnected to it via several passages is Flintstone Passage. This splits into many different passages that break into the left bank of the canyon downstream of Holuca. Away from the river, Flintstone runs into another of the caves' unique passages, Mudwall Passage, which has filled with mud almost to the 3 m high roof. Following the infilling process a vadose trench has been cut the length of the passage revealing that the mud is formed of thin laminations. Mudwall Passage: the passage shows the mud strata caused by annual floods. After 200 m the Mudwall Passage enters into the small Mudwall Chamber. This has been formed by water coming from Link Passage on the west cutting across the line of the Mudwall Passage disappearing into Rimstone Passage to the east. It is this flow of water that formed the chamber. Climbing out of Mudwall Chamber leads to Batshit Passage, whose floor is knee deep in guano. This leads to the large chamber, the Astrodome, which houses a large colony of bats. Link Passage is a narrow rift passage that links back to the Chamber of Columns. A series of small passages at two levels leave Link Passage and heads towards the river passage. One of these leads into the wide Blind Passage, which also emerges into the Chamber of Columns. The upper passage is a tight crawl into the pretentiously named Wembley Stadium. This passage is formed in a fault. The survey of the British expedition in 1972 showed that the Wembley Fault extended from a right bank passage on the river to Wembley Stadium, Mudwall and Rimstone Passages. The shakehole on the plateau is centred on the Wembley Fault line. Obviously the fault played a significant role in the major collapse that created the shakehole. The underground debris from the collapse forms the Big Rapids and is responsible for the boulder chokes seen near Blank Passage.

Medical ethics CMF regularly contributes to debate on issues of medical ethics, such as making submissions to the UK House of Lords enquiry into physician-assisted suicide, and is opposed to legal access to abortion and euthanasia in the United Kingdom. In some of these activities, CMF works together with other faith-based and non- faith-based groups, such as the Care Not Killing Alliance and the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship. The position of the Christian Medical Fellowship has been to actively encourage doctors and medical students to use opportunities arising from the doctor-patient relationship to discuss faith with patients. Criticism The Christian Medical Fellowship has been the subject of complaint from several Hindu leaders to the House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences objecting to a claim that Hinduism was a 'false religion.'. In October 2007, the Christian Medical Fellowship was accused by The Guardian newspaper of attempting to skew the balance of evidence presented at the Parliamentary review of the UK's laws on abortion due to a number of its members presenting evidence at the Parliamentary Select Committee without revealing their membership and seniority within the organisation. The members concerned stated that they were submitting evidence as individuals, not as representatives of CMF, and they declared their affiliation when asked to do so in an unusual step by the Committee.

Located sixty miles from Manhattan in the Three Village area, Ward Melville High School is situated in East Setauket, New York. The school serves students from Setauket, East Setauket, South Setauket, Stony Brook, Old Field, Strongs Neck, and Poquott. As of the 2011‚Äì12 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,848 students and 140.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 13.2.Ward Melville High School, National Center for Education Statistics. Accessed May 9, 2020. The building was originally designed to have with capacity for 2,000 students, although it has been expanded several times since. Each of the three grades currently has approximately 600 students. The district provides for numerous clubs and activities after school, including a musical‚Äìtheater arts program and many sports teams. The school offers 25 different Advanced Placement courses and another 25 college courses that are offered credit through several colleges and universities. The school has been expanded several times to accommodate the growing number of students attending Ward Melville High School. In 2002, two extra wings were added to the northeastern and southeastern corners of the school. During the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, a new weight training facility was completed in the rear of the school while the music rooms were renovated. In the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, an additional wing was built to house the science department while the auditorium and the library was refurbished. Achievements Ward Melville High School has been recognized as a School of Excellence by the United States Department of Education and carries this designation on each student's transcript and diploma. It was ranked within the top 500 high schools in America in 2004 by MSNBC Newsweek. The proximity of Ward Melville to Stony Brook University has encouraged the school to house a very strong science research program. This program annually produces many winners in the Intel Science Talent Search, the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair and other science competitions. In 1998, Ward Melville had the highest number of Science Talent Search finalists in the United States (4 out of 40), and in 2006, it tied for the greatest number of semifinalists (12 out of 300). In 2008, Ward Melville achieved the highest number of Intel Semifinalists in the nation with 13 students. Over the past nine years, 2002‚Äì2010, Ward Melville has produced a total of 85 Intel semi-finalists and 11 finalists, the third-most of any secondary school in the United States. =Lacrosse= The school's lacrosse team won the 1999 New York State championship.

A micrograph of bronze revealing a cast dendritic structure Al-Si microstructure Microstructure is the very small scale structure of a material, defined as the structure of a prepared surface of material as revealed by an optical microscope above 25√ó magnification.Adapted from ASM Metals Handbook, Ninth Edition, v. 9, \\"Metallography and Microstructures\\", American Society for Metals, Metals Park, OH, 1985, p. 12. The microstructure of a material (such as metals, polymers, ceramics or composites) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behaviour or wear resistance. These properties in turn govern the application of these materials in industrial practice. Microstructure at scales smaller than that can be viewed with optical microscopes is often called nanostructure, while the structure in which individual atoms are arranged is known as crystal structure. The nanostructure of biological specimens is referred to as ultrastructure. A microstructure‚Äôs influence on the mechanical and physical properties of a material is primarily governed by the different defects present or absent of the structure. These defects can take many forms but the primary ones are the pores. Even if those pores play a very important role in the definition of the characteristics of a material, so does its composition. In fact, for many materials, different phases can exist at the same time. These phases have different properties and if managed correctly, can prevent the fracture of the material. Methods The concept of microstructure is observable in macrostructural features in commonplace objects. Galvanized steel, such as the casing of a lamp post or road divider, exhibits a non- uniformly colored patchwork of interlocking polygons of different shades of grey or silver. Each polygon is a single crystal of zinc adhering to the surface of the steel beneath. Zinc and lead are two common metals which form large crystals (grains) visible to the naked eye. The atoms in each grain are organized into one of seven 3d stacking arrangements or crystal lattices (cubic, tetrahedral, hexagonal, monoclinic, triclinic, rhombohedral and orthorhombic). The direction of alignment of the matrices differ between adjacent crystals, leading to variance in the reflectivity of each presented face of the interlocked grains on the galvanized surface. The average grain size can be controlled by processing conditions and composition, and most alloys consist of much smaller grains not visible to the naked eye. This is to increase the strength of the material (see Hall-Petch Strengthening). Microstructure Characterizations To quantify microstructural features, both morphological and material property must be characterized. Image processing is a robust technique for determination of morphological features such as volume fraction,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279771139_Uncorrelated_volume_element_for_stochastic_modeling_of_microstructures_based_on_local_fiber_volume_fraction_variation inclusion morphology,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305803249_Characterization_synthetic_generation_and_statistical_equivalence_of_composite_microstructures void and crystal orientations. To acquire micrographs, optical as well as electron microscopy are commonly used. To determine material property, Nanoindentation is a robust technique for determination of properties in micron and submicron level for which conventional testing are not feasible. Conventional mechanical testing such as tensile testing or dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) can only return macroscopic properties without any indication of microstructural properties. However, nanoindentation can be used for determination of local microstructural properties of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292208855_Length- scale_dependence_of_variability_in_epoxy_modulus_extracted_from_composite_prepreg Microstructures can also be characterized using high-order statistical models through which a set of complicated statistical properties are extracted from the images. Then, these properties can be used to produce various other stochastic models. Microstructure Generation Computer-simulated microstructures are generated to replicate the microstructural features of actual microstructures. Such microstructures are referred to as synthetic microstructures. Synthetic microstructures are used to investigate what microstructural feature is important for a given property. To ensure statistical equivalence between generated and actual microstructures, microstructures are modified after generation to match the statistics of an actual microstructure. Such procedure enables generation of theoretically infinite number of computer simulated microstructures that are statistically the same (have the same statistics) but stochastically different (have different configurations).https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305803249_Characterization_synthetic_generation_and_statistical_equivalence_of_composite_microstructures A computer simulated microstructure of composite materialshttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/305803249_Characterization_synthetic_generation_and_statistical_equivalence_of_composite_microstructures Influence of pores and composition A pore in a microstructure, unless desired, is a disadvantage for the properties. In fact, in nearly all of the materials, a pore will be the starting point for the rupture of the material. It is the initiation point for the cracks. Furthermore, a pore is usually quite hard to get rid of. Those techniques described later involve a high temperature process. However, even those processes can sometimes make the pore even bigger. Pores with large coordination number (surrounded by many particles) tend to grow during the thermal process. This is caused by the thermal energy being converted to a driving force for the growth of the particles which will induce the growth of the pore as the high coordination number prohibits the growth towards the pore. For many materials, it can be seen from their phase diagram that multiple phases can exist at the same time. Those different phases might exhibit different crystal structure, thus exhibiting different mechanical properties.Oberwinkler, B., Modeling the fatigue crack growth behavior of Ti-6Al-4V by considering grain size and stress ratio. Materials Science and Engineering: A 2011, 528 (18), 5983-5992. Furthermore, these different phases also exhibit a different microstructure (grain size, orientation).Sieniawski, J.; Ziaja, W.; Kubiak, K.; Motyka, M., Microstructure and mechanical properties of high strength two-phase titanium alloys. Titanium Alloys-Advances in Properties Control 2013, 69-80. This can also improve some mechanical properties as crack deflection can occur, thus pushing the ultimate breakdown further as it creates a more tortuous crack path in the coarser microstructure.Nalla, R.; Boyce, B.; Campbell, J.; Peters, J.; Ritchie, R., Influence of microstructure on high-cycle fatigue of Ti-6Al-4V: bimodal vs. lamellar structures. Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A 2002, 33 (13), 899-918. Improvement techniques In some cases, simply changing the way the material is processed can influence the microstructure. An example is the titanium alloy TiAl6V4.Henriques, V. A. R.; Campos, P. P. d.; Cairo, C. A. A.; Bressiani, J. C., Production of titanium alloys for advanced aerospace systems by powder metallurgy. Materials Research 2005, 8 (4), 443-446. Its microstructure and mechanical properties are enhanced using SLM (selective laser melting) which is a 3D printing technique using powder and melting the particles together using high powered laser.Kruth, J.-P.; Mercelis, P.; Van Vaerenbergh, J.; Froyen, L.; Rombouts, M., Binding mechanisms in selective laser sintering and selective laser melting. Rapid prototyping journal 2005, 11 (1), 26-36. Other conventional techniques for improving the microstructure are thermal processes.Murr, L.; Quinones, S.; Gaytan, S.; Lopez, M.; Rodela, A.; Martinez, E.; Hernandez, D.; Martinez, E.; Medina, F.; Wicker, R., Microstructure and mechanical behavior of Ti‚Äì6Al‚Äì4V produced by rapid-layer manufacturing, for biomedical applications. Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials 2009, 2 (1), 20-32. Those processes rely in the principle that an increase in temperature will induce the reduction or annihilation of pores.Kasperovich, G.; Hausmann, J., Improvement of fatigue resistance and ductility of TiAl6V4 processed by selective laser melting. Journal of Materials Processing Technology 2015, 220, 202-214. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is a manufacturing process, used to reduce the porosity of metals and increase the density of many ceramic materials. This improves the material's mechanical properties and workability.Lin, C. Y.; Wirtz, T.; LaMarca, F.; Hollister, S. J., Structural and mechanical evaluations of a topology optimized titanium interbody fusion cage fabricated by selective laser melting process. Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A 2007, 83 (2), 272-279. The HIP process exposes the desired material to an isostatic gas pressure as well as high temperature in a sealed vessel (high pressure). The gas used during this process is mostly Argon. The gas needs to be chemically inert so that no reaction occurs between it and the sample. The pressure is achieved by simply applying heat to the hermetically sealed vessel. However, some systems also associate gas pumping to the process to achieve the required pressure level. The pressure applied on the materials is equal and comes from all directions (hence the term ‚Äúisostatic‚Äù).Leuders, S.; Th√∂ne, M.; Riemer, A.; Niendorf, T.; Tr√∂ster, T.; Richard, H.; Maier, H., On the mechanical behaviour of titanium alloy TiAl6V4 manufactured by selective laser melting: Fatigue resistance and crack growth performance. International Journal of Fatigue 2013, 48, 300-307. When castings are treated with HIP, the simultaneous application of heat and pressure eliminates internal voids and microporosity through a combination of plastic deformation, creep, and diffusion bonding; this process improves fatigue resistance of the component.Larker, H. T.; Larker, R., Hot isostatic pressing. Materials Science and Technology 1991.

With a village atmosphere, the place is partly named after the River Trym, which flows through it. History The origins of Westbury on Trym predate those of Bristol itself. At the end of the 8th century, King Offa of Mercia granted land at Westbury to his minister, Aethelmund. Later there was a monastery at Westbury, probably initially a secular one, with married clergy. This changed towards the end of the 10th century when Oswald of Worcester, in whose diocese the monastery lay, sent a party of 12 monks to follow more stringent rules at the Westbury monastery.Victoria County History of Gloucestershire: The College of Westbury on Trym The architect Ednoth constructed a new church and other buildings. The monastery became a college with a dean and canons at the end of the 13th century. It was rebuilt in the mid-15th century to resemble a miniature castle with turrets and a gatehouse. The Royalist Prince Rupert of the Rhine used it as his quarters during the English Civil War. When he left, in 1643, he ordered it to be set on fire so that the Parliamentarians could not make use of it. In the 20th century some of the college buildings were restored. Westbury College Gatehouse passed into the hands of the National Trust and the grounds were adapted for housing elderly people. The current Church of the Holy Trinity dates from 1194 (although there has been a place of worship on the site since 717), with an early 13th century nave and aisles, and 15th century chancel, chapels and tower. It is a grade I listed building. The ancient parish of Westbury on Trym was a large one. It included Stoke Bishop, Redland, a large exclave comprising Shirehampton and Avonmouth, and several smaller exclaves in the parish of Henbury.Vision of Britain: Boundary map When the civil parish was created in 1866, Shirehampton was separated to form its own civil parish, and in 1894 Redland also became a separate civil parish. In 1904 the civil parish was abolished and absorbed into Bristol.Vision of Britain website Redland remained in the ecclesiastical parish of Westbury until 1942. Development of the village into a large suburb of Bristol was started in the 1920s and was well underway by the 30s. Many detached and semi- detached villas were built in this period. Apart from during WW2, major house building did not cease until the 60s. Falcondale Road was constructed during the 1930s to act as a bypass to the narrow twisting streets of the old village. With the opening of the Filton Bypass in the late 30s, Falcondale Road acted as a major conduit for A38 holiday traffic going to and from the South West. However, when the Filton Bypass was split into two by the construction of the Brabazon Runway in the late 40s, A38 traffic had to be directed to the original route through Filton. Amenities Westbury on Trym High Street has three Indian and one Thai restaurants. There is also the Villager Restaurant (Modern English) at the end of College Road, eight pubs and several caf√©s. The village centre is well-served for shoppers, containing banks and independent stores including book shops, craft stores, hardware shops, florists, and a number of charity shops. Two free car parks are available and a medium-sized supermarket, built on the site of the previous Carlton cinema, above which there is a ladies only gym. During 2001, a large Sainsbury's was proposed, but the opposition to the plan was so strong from local villagers that the supermarket construction was eventually scrapped. In November 2013 a Tesco Metro opened on the site of a closed pub (The Foresters Tavern) just off the central War Memorial in the Village, its coming had been the subject of much discussion in the village and had been strongly opposed by many. Schools within the area include Elmlea Infant School, Elmlea Junior School, Bristol Free School and Westbury on Trym Church of England Academy. Independent schools include the prestigious girls' schools Badminton, which has taught pupils such as Indira Gandhi, Princess Haya of Jordan and the daughter of the Sultan of Brunei; Red Maids', the oldest surviving girls' school in England. A new doctors' surgery has been constructed for Westbury near to the Holy Trinity Church and the Westbury Hill Car Park. This replaces the previous surgery which was housed in a building on Falcondale Road. Canford Cemetery opened in 1903, acquiring a crematorium in 1957. Transport Transport routes include the A4018, which runs from the city centre to Cribbs Causeway. Westbury is served by bus routes 1, 5, 20, 55, 501, 502, 508, 624, and service X14 also connects Westbury-on-Trym with Chepstow and Newport, South Wales. The nearest railway station is Sea Mills station at Sea Mills. Notable residents The wealthy Bristol merchant William Canynge was dean of Westbury College from 1469 to 1474.

The house, which had Gothic turrets and battlements, was demolished in 1925 to make way for retirement accommodation. The poet Robert Southey, who later in his life became one of the Lake poets and the Poet Laureate, lived in the village for a year in 1798‚Äì99, during which he wrote his Eclogues and much other poetry. His social circle at the time included the Wedgwoods of Cote House and chemist Humphry Davy, who was also living in Bristol then. Southey took part in Davy's experiments with laughing gas. William Pennefather (1816-1873), the Irish-born clergyman noted for his hymns and sermons, went to school here in the late 1820s. Amelia Edwards the traveller, novelist and Egyptologist lived in Eastfield, at the eastern end of the village, from c. 1864 to 1892.

Three people were killed and 30 were taken to hospital with injuries when one train rear-ended another train. The subway line was shut down for five days following the incident. Investigations found that human error and a design flaw in the mechanical safety devices caused this accident. It remains the deadliest accident in a rapid transit system in Canadian history.  Overview  At 6:02 p.m. on Friday, August 11, 1995, a subway train running southbound on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity ran into the rear of a stationary train halfway between St. Clair West and Dupont stations. There were between 200 and 300 passengers on the two trains, of whom three (Christina Munar Reyes, 33; Kinga Szabo, 43; and Xian Hui Lin, 23) were killed and 30 taken to hospital with injuries; about 100 more later filed injury claims against the TTC. Many of the seriously injured were extracted from the twisted remains of the most damaged subway cars by rescue workers who worked through the evening under extremely hot and humid conditions. Of the four crew members, three were taken to hospital with injuries.  Direct causes  The accident had two direct causes: first the inexperienced driver, Robert Jeffrey, who mistook the signals; and the train stop which failed to protect the train due to a design error. = Signals = Signal lightbox at a switch of the Toronto subway At the time of the accident, the TTC subway used conventional wayside signals without cab signalling. Thus drivers were expected to remember each signal aspect and act accordingly until they receive new information from the following signal. As of 2019, the TTC has converted some sections of the line, including the Russell Hill portion, to more modern automatic train control. The following description is limited to aspects relevant to the accident. Some signals are \\"automatic\\" and have a single head that shows one of the three basic colours. Red means stop and stay (until presented with a less restrictive signal aspect), yellow means that the next signal is red and the driver should prepare to stop, and green means that the next signal is not red and it is safe to proceed at normal speed. \\"Interlocking\\" or \\"home\\" signals have a double head and show two coloured lights. The top light has the same meaning as that of an automatic signal. The second light is red if the top light is red; otherwise it shows yellow if the switches are set for a secondary route, and green for the main route or if no relevant switches exist. Thus the combination yellow over green means the same as a single yellow. At locations such as downgrades, curves, and switches, the same signals additionally serve to enforce speed limits. A system called \\"grade timing\\" regulates speeds, and is indicated by an additional \\"lunar white\\" light below the one or two coloured lights previously mentioned. The white light means that the next signal is red (or double red) only because of grade timing, and if the train approaches at the proper speed, the signal will clear to a less restrictive aspect before the train gets there. If the train goes too fast, it will pass the red signal and be stopped by the train stop. In 1995 the second signal did not provide any confirmation that it was about to change and the operator was expected to remember the previous signal aspect correctly. With the tolerant attitudes of management, it had become common practice for operators to travel at the fastest speed that the system allowed, passing the signals at the same instant they were clearing. A long downgrade would therefore have several consecutive grade-timing sections. If all the signals were automatic and no trains were present, the first signal would be yellow over white, followed by a series of red over whites, and finally a red. When the train approaches each red over white signal, it would clear to yellow over white and the train stop would be lowered; and the final red signal would clear to green. Interlocking signals can also take part in grade timing, with aspects such as yellow over green over white (meaning the same as yellow over white). Looking south from St. Clair West station. Signal SP77/X38 can be seen showing red over red. From St. Clair West to Dupont the subway runs continuously downhill and grade timing is used. The signal at the end of St. Clair West station, SP77/X38, is an interlocking signal and therefore shows yellow over green over white whenever there is nothing to delay a train. As Jeffrey's train passed the signal, however, it was showing yellow over green. He should have stopped at the following signal, SP71, which was red because another train was occupying the block ahead. After the accident Jeffrey said he remembered SP77/X38 as yellow over white (actually an impossible aspect for that signal) therefore he must have either \\"misremembered\\" it at the time, or else have been fooled by some reflection off the signal head into thinking he had seen the usual yellow over green over white. In any case, he believed that grade timing was in use and so approached signal SP71 at the same speed as he would normally drive on this section. After this Jeffrey did not remember what he had seen, but it is easy to reconstruct the events. When the train passed SP71 without him seeing it change, he must have assumed that he had passed it just as it cleared. He continued coasting downhill, still thinking that he was under grade timing and violated the signal, without realizing that if this was true, the signal would have shown red over white as he approached. He must therefore have expected the third signal, (the SP65) to clear in the same way. Again it was showing red, not red over white, but Jeffrey repeated his mistake and violated the signal. He braked only when he actually saw the train just ahead (it was stopped at the next signal, SP53); by then, a collision was unavoidable. News media accounts of the accident often say that Jeffrey \\"passed three red lights.\\" This count includes the repeater signal provided in advance of SP65 because a curve in the tunnel interferes with sighting. Drivers are not expected to stop at the repeater even if it is red. = Train stop = The \\"trip\\" or \\"train stop\\" consists of a T-shaped arm placed just outside the right-hand rail near each signal (except a repeater). If the signal is red (or double red), with or without a lunar white, the trip arm rises enough for its crossbar to strike a \\"trip valve\\" or \\"tripcock\\" lever on the bottom of a train's first car as it passes; and by doing so triggers the emergency brakes of the train. On the relevant class of trains, the trip valve is located near the centre of the right side of the leading bogie, where its position in relation to the rail is well controlled. Wismer and Becker, Inc., the contractors who installed the signal system on the Spadina line portion of the subway, chose to use an Ericsson train stop that was designed to have the trip arm located in the middle of the track. A subcontractor, Gayle Manufacturing, designed a mechanical extension that would allow the device to drive a trip arm in its actual position outside of the rail. What was not realized was that the mechanism they designed (when the trip arm was raised) did not have the clearance specified for the train and therefore would not have the desired effect of activating the train's emergency braking system. When both the trip arm and trip valve were new, this did not matter; the train did not fill its entire clearance envelope, and the trip arm would contact the trip valve normally. However, with normal wear of the wheels and rails, and with the train rounding a curve at speed (and therefore riding off-centre) it was another matter. The first wheel on the right-hand side of the train hit a bolt in the mechanism attached to the trip arm and knocked the arm down. It would then rise again, but too late: with the train moving quickly, the trip valve, just a few feet behind the wheel, would already have gone past, thus making the train stop useless for ensuring signal compliance.  Inquest  The jury at the coroner's inquest produced 18 recommendations: #Reform of the Railways Act (1950) to provide oversight of the Toronto Transit Commission. #The TTC should submit to an independent safety audit every two years, beyond that done by APTA. This independent agency will be set up under the revised Railway Act. #Completion of the \\"Due Diligence Checklist\\" of deficiencies identified by the TTC. #The Province and Metro commit to a \\"State of Good Repair\\" funding policy; repair to take precedence over new works (see Line 4 Sheppard); future capital funding based on the State of Good Repair. The jury indicated that underfunding since the mid-1980s has contributed to the deterioration of the system and had jeopardized the safety of the Toronto Transit Commission. #Improvements to the Operations Training Centre starting with the hiring of an accredited adult training specialist. The updated training package should include at least: realistic pass / fail grading, annual refresher for all operators, emphasis on the meaning of the signal system, route supervisory accompaniment for at least one day of complete runs after training completion. #An updated Operations Training Centre to include a suitable subway simulator. #A comprehensive review of the signal system with emphasis in the following areas: Lunar Whites, removal of signal identification markers, consistent placement of signal aspects, progressive speed control, expansion of IPHC to identify headway and train separation, all trip valves activated and relocation of reset. #Elimination of auto key-by facility and implementation of raised trip arm immediately after train has passed. #Advanced implementation of the new subway communications system. #Improved communication within the organisation. #A new Transit Control Centre including the updating of the skills of TTC staff. #The current Transit Control Centre should only be responsible for Operations. Such things as intrusion alarms, facility maintenance, public information, media relations and other related concerns should be handled by an adjacent facility. #Emergency response exercise every five years with \\"everybody\\". Yearly reviews by the Safety department #Improved predictive and preventative maintenance with computer assist where applicable. #Review of equipment procurement with respect to quality control. The procurement of cheap equipment (the Ericsson train stops) is a misuse of resources and a serious safety issue. #Traceable design criteria and standards for track, signal and subway cars. No modifications without approval of design review authority. #Train operators and the TTC must identify signal malfunctions by signal identification numbers. Review of the discipline system to allow for signal malfunctions. Operators reporting for duty to meet an inspector so that \\"State of the road\\" information can be passed on. Rookie operators not to be scheduled together. #The office of the Chief Coroner is to convene a press conference one year hence to provide all parties with an update on the implementation of these recommendations. The 18 recommendations were taken by the TTC and turned into a 236-point \\"Due Diligence Checklist\\" of items to be addressed. Each year the Toronto Transit Commission receives a report on the outstanding items. By 2009, only 2 of the recommendations had yet to be completed.http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2009/August_26_2009/Reports/Russell_Hill_Subway_.pdf By 2015, all 236 recommendations had been implemented.  Aftermath  The TTC acted quickly following the accident to repair the defective modified Ericsson train stops. They also began requiring drivers to traverse grade-timing sections at a speed that would allow them to actually see the red signal change before they left the section. In 1997 and 1998, the behaviour of the signals themselves was changed. Now, when a signal is red (or double red) only because of grade timing, the (top) red light begins flashing once a train has passed the preceding signal that displayed the lunar white light. The trip arm remains up during this phase, but the flashing red confirms to the driver that there was a lunar white on entry to the section and that the signal can be expected to clear at any moment. Jeffrey's mistaken interpretation of the red signal SP71 would no longer be possible. The incident in the arts In 2003, Toronto's Tarragon Theatre produced a play by Chris Earle, called Russell Hill, about the incident.

He is an original member of Dexys Midnight Runners and played on the number one single \\"Geno\\". He has also written the single \\"Twist in the Dark\\" for Anni-Frid Lyngstad of Abba. His solo single \\"Say Something\\" reached the number 1 position in Lebanon during the civil war. Biography Leek began his musical career while still at school in the progressive punk band The Wailing Cocks. The band released two singles on independent label Birds Nest, recorded two sessions for John Peel's Radio 1 show, Kid Jensen Live and Radio 2's in Concert Live. However, the band's career was cut short by the tragic death of their guitarist and Leek's best friend Alan Boyle. At the age of 21, Leek joined Dexys Midnight Runners in late October 1979, playing on early recordings such as the hit single \\"Geno\\" and four other tracks on their debut album Searching for the Young Soul Rebels. Just before the band were at No. 1 in the charts with this track, Leek left to be a solo artist, saying that he \\"Really hating being famous all of a sudden ... Just because I've been on Top of the Pops doesn't mean I should get any more respect. I didn't want people asking for my autograph all of the time.\\"Record Mirror, 10 May 1980 Two earlier songs Leek had recorded with the Wailing Cocks were then licensed to Beggars Banquet Records for release as a double-A-sided solo single: \\"Move On (In Your Maserati)\\" / \\"Ruben Decides\\". These were both played on Radio One and were single of the week in Sounds. In early 1981, Leek teamed up with fellow ex-Dexys member Kevin \\"Al\\" Archer in his new band The Blue Ox Babes in which Leek played piano, harmonium, harmonica and sung backing vocals. Some months later, on the strength of a demo tape of 16 new songs, Beggars Banquet paid for an album's worth of new material but this lay dormant until their belated release as Midnight Music on Leek's own Undiscovered Classics label in 2009. One song from these sessions, \\"Twist in the Dark\\", was recorded by Frida from ABBA for her 1984 solo album Shine, via a recommendation from Leek's friend Kirsty MacColl. Frida's version was also issued as a single around the world and she described this song as \\"her favourite song she had recorded outside of Abba\\". For the rest of the 1980s, Leek pursued his own career as a musician, as well as writing a musical interpretation of a Dylan Thomas poem which was recorded and released by Tom Jones, and acting alongside Billie Whitelaw and David Van Day as an aspiring songwriter in the Tony Klinger-produced 1985 movie Promo-Man. A short-lived deal with indie label Fascination Records in 1984 led to two singles credited to Leek: \\"Soul Darling\\", with Specials producer Dave Jordan, and a version of ABBA's \\"Dancing Queen\\" produced by Tony Visconti . In 1988, after signing a publishing and management contract with Hit n Run music, Atlantic Records in New York. Leek was honoured that, after hearing five of his tracks, George Martin had considered three of the five tracks as potential number 1's and he agreed to produce his 1988 album, Say Something. It was recorded in Martin's A.I.R. Studios with such musicians as Steve Howe of Yes, Clem Clempson, Lu√≠s Jardim on percussion, Alan Murphy of Level 42 on guitar, Peter-John Vettese (keyboards, from Jethro Tull), and veteran bassist Mo Fostera 36 piece orchestra on various tracks and the London Community Gospel Choir on the Golden Doors. George Martin said that Andy \\"was one of the greatest artists he had ever produced\\". The first release from the album was Please Please. In 2007 a Lebanese DJ/Producer, called aXess, contacted Leek to request to do a Salsa remix of the track. Say Something which had reached the number 1 position in Lebanon during the civil war. Leek has since recorded three further albums, Eternity Beckons (including the single \\"All Around The World\\", which proved popular in Germany) the self-produced Sacrifice And Bliss (which yielded the single \\"Forgotten People\\") and Waking up the World (with the single of the same name) All of which are now being released on his own label. Eternity Beckons was also briefly available on a small Spanish label, Ouver Records. The song Forgotten people was also released on a compilation album which made it to number one in Spain. After a period studying musical composition at Cardiff University, Leek formed his own \\"party band\\" Andy Leek & The Blue Angels, Andy Leek & The Blue Angels website mostly at charity balls. Leek has also appeared on various TV shows: The James Whale Show, Never Mind The Buzzcocks, Later with Jools Holland and Children in Need three years running. In 2010, Leek remixed the album Say Something now entitled Say Something Revisited released with the single \\"What's the Problem?\\". 22 years on in May 2013 Leek released a 16-track double concept album Waking up the World For this album each song has a sister song which reflects and explores the other side of its counterpart. This results in seven themes which tell a story of youth, experience, realisation and return. In 2013 Leek started releasing his past music on YouTube with many lyric videos created.

Bloom founded and owns the Bloom Firm, a law firm that has represented clients including Kathy Griffin and Mischa Barton. Bloom was also the anchor of Lisa Bloom: Open Court (formerly Bloom and Politan: Open Court), a two-hour live legal news program on truTV's In Session, from 2006 to 2009. Bloom is the only child of civil rights attorney Gloria Allred and Peyton Huddleston Bray Jr. Early life and education Bloom was born Lisa Read Bray, the daughter of Gloria Bloom (later Allred) and father Peyton Huddleston Bray Jr. Her mother is of Jewish descent. Her parents' marriage was short-lived‚Äîthey had married and divorced while in college. Peyton Bray, who suffered from bipolar disorder, later killed himself, and Bloom subsequently took her mother's maiden name. When Bloom was seven, her mother married William C. Allred. Bloom received a bachelor's degree from UCLA, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was National College Debate Champion. She received her J.D. degree from Yale Law School in 1986. Career =Early career= After graduating from law school, Bloom began her career in New York and by 1991 worked at her mother‚Äôs law firm, Allred, Maroko & Goldberg, assisting in unsuccessfully suing the Boy Scouts of America for sex discrimination on behalf of Katrina Yeaw, a girl who wanted to join the organization. While at her mother‚Äôs firm, Bloom also filed a child sexual abuse suit against the Roman Catholic Church and sued the LAPD. =Later career= In 2001, Bloom left her mother‚Äôs firm, having developed a career in cable news punditry, eventually serving as a legal analyst on CBS News, CNN, HLN, and MSNBC, and appearing on The Early Show, The Insider, Dr. Phil, Dr. Drew, The Situation Room, Reliable Sources, The Joy Behar Show, Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell, and The Stephanie Miller Show. Bloom returned to practicing law in 2010 when she founded the Bloom Firm, a small, general- practice law firm that handles family, civil and criminal matters. She is licensed to practice law in both New York and California. At the Bloom Firm, Bloom has represented several notable clients, including model and actress Janice Dickinson in her defamation case against comedian Bill Cosby, as well as model and actress Mischa Barton in her revenge porn case. Model Blac Chyna later hired Bloom to obtain a temporary restraining order against socialite Rob Kardashian, with whom Chyna shares a daughter, Dream. Amid a series of sexual abuse allegations against powerful men in entertainment and media, and following a BuzzFeed report detailing a sexual harassment settlement paid out of Representative John Conyers‚Äô office budget, Bloom represented Marion Brown, who spoke to BuzzFeed off the record and later came forward publicly to allege harassment by Conyers. Bill O'Reilly sexual harassment allegations In 2017 Bloom represented three women accusing then-Fox News anchor Bill O‚ÄôReilly of sexual harassment. Jehmu Greene, a television commentator who had appeared on Fox News, also approached Bloom with sexual harassment allegations against O'Reilly, although she ultimately declined Bloom's services. One of Bloom's clients, Wendy Walsh, filed the complaint that led Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, to initiate an investigation that resulted in O'Reilly's dismissal and the end of his eponymous program. Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Bloom offered to represent four women who alleged sexual misconduct by then- presidential candidate Donald Trump. Two of these women came forward publicly with their allegations, including Jill Harth and Lisa Boyne, and two who did not, including a woman from Virginia and another woman who claimed Trump had raped her when she was thirteen years old. On November 2, 2016, Bloom canceled a press conference with the unnamed client, saying the client was scared because of death threats. According to Bloom, after this press conference, multiple donors contacted her with offers to cover accusers' relocation and security. Bloom felt an obligation to relay the offers to her clients. The Virginia woman said that donors had offered her as much as $750,000, but that she declined the offer. In a 2017 report, The New York Times identified the donors who contacted Bloom as David Brock's American Bridge 21st Century, which offered $200,000, and Susie Tompkins Buell, who offered $500,000. Harvey Weinstein and Roy Price sexual misconduct allegations Bloom received significant media attention after film producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual misconduct in October 2017. While noting that Weinstein \\"denies many of the accusations as patently false,\\" Bloom acknowledged advising Weinstein on power dynamics and harassment, calling him \\"an old dinosaur learning new ways.\\" Bloom's advisory role, which she assumed in late 2016, was pilloried for its dissonance with her prior representation of sexual assault victims, with some in the media calling her book adaptation deal with The Weinstein Company, signed during Weinstein's tenure as co-chairman, a conflict of interest. On October 7, 2017, two days after the initial article on sexual misconduct in The New York Times, Bloom stepped down from her advisory role amid mounting public criticism and friction with The Weinstein Company's board. According to emails obtained by The New York Times, Bloom had weighed responding to allegations against Weinstein with \\"photos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct.\\" Bloom denied plotting to undermine the accusers. The Daily Beast later reported that Bloom had offered journalist Ronan Farrow opposition research on one of Weinstein's accusers, Rose McGowan, during his own reporting on Weinstein. In Farrow's 2019 book, he further claims that Bloom would report any information gleaned about his investigation back to Weinstein, and that she admitted to being \\"his people\\". A 2019 book by reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey contains a 2016 memo from Bloom, as well as 2017 billing statements for services rendered on Weinstein's behalf. These documents show how Bloom would proactively assist Weinstein in undermining his accusers.'She Said' Reveals The People And Practices That Protected Weinstein : NPR Shortly after resigning from Weinstein's team, Bloom fell victim to \\"email prankster\\" James Linton masquerading as Weinstein. In reply to the prankster, Bloom wrote that \\"[t]he new round of far more serious allegations were not made known to me\\". Variety later reported that Bloom \\"was only aware of accusations of verbal remarks, behaviors, and temper tantrums\\" when she began advising Weinstein, and was unaware of more serious allegations of rape and sexual assault. Within weeks of the initial report in The New York Times, Bloom publicly apologized for her role advising Weinstein. Bloom also represented former Amazon Studios president Roy Price amid sexual harassment allegations, but said her representation of Price concluded before Price's accuser Isa Hackett \\"went public\\". The Daily Beast reported that Bloom, while representing Price, had attempted to disparage Kim Masters, The Hollywood Reporter's Editor-at-Large, to media outlets considering publishing Masters' report on the allegations against Price. Bloom had allegedly accused Masters of a conflict of interest for badgering Price to advertise on her KCRW show, a charge Masters denied. Kathy Griffin controversy and fallout Following a controversial 2017 photo shoot in which comedienne Kathy Griffin clenched a severed and bloodied mask that resembled the face of President Donald Trump, Bloom held a joint press conference with Griffin, then her client, to address the controversy. Their appearance was widely panned in the media for its self- victimization and lack of focus. Amid fallout over Bloom's role advising Harvey Weinstein, Griffin posted a Facebook video denouncing Bloom and her husband, Braden Pollock, for \\"exacerbat[ing] my personal situation\\". Griffin later publicly asked Bloom to stop calling her and denounced Bloom for \\"fame- whoring,\\" a criticism of Bloom's proposal for a joint media tour following their joint press conference. According to Griffin, Bloom also charged exorbitant legal fees, which Griffin estimated were $40,000 for two days' representation, including by defense attorney Dmitry Gorin, whom Bloom allegedly hired without Griffin's consent. In response to Griffin's comments, Bloom claimed she \\"had no idea there was a problem\\" and released a statement criticizing Griffin for speaking extemporaneously at their press conference. Bloom nevertheless wished Griffin well. Following Griffin's own comments on Bloom, Tamara Holder, a former Bloom client, and Jehmu Greene, who had considered hiring Bloom, came forward with their own criticisms. Holder had retained Bloom after accusing Fox News Latino Vice President Francisco Cortes of sexual assault. According to Holder, Bloom proposed an initial retainer agreement granting herself 40% of any settlement, as well as a $10,000 retainer fee and reimbursement for any relevant hotel and travel expenses. Although Holder ultimately negotiated a more favorable contract, she criticized Bloom for charging thousands of dollars in extraneous fees, as well as pushing Holder to accept a gag order in her settlement with Fox News. For her part, Greene called Bloom \\"deceptive\\" for presenting her with a contract for media representation after a meeting focused primarily on legal services. Bloom responded to both allegations by claiming that \\"the vast majority of [the Bloom Firm's] clients are delighted with our work\\". Martin Chitwood case In October 2014, Carol Swanson Chitwood (n/k/a Carol Swanson Smith) retained Lisa Bloom and the Bloom Firm to pursue domestic violence claims against her then-husband, Martin Chitwood, a prominent Atlanta attorney, who had sued her for divorce in Atlanta two months earlier. While the divorce was still pending, Bloom filed suit against Martin Chitwood in California asserting domestic violence claims on Carol Chitwood‚Äôs behalf. Martin Chitwood denied the allegations, claiming they were a tactic to prevent the enforcement of the parties' prenuptial agreement and force a settlement. Martin Chitwood refused to settle, and on August 31, 2017, after a five-week civil trial, a twelve-person jury found him not liable for the claim Bloom brought against him. Bloom did not appeal. =Other= Bloom and her firm are representing male model Jason Boyce in his lawsuit against fashion photographer Bruce Weber among other people in New York State Supreme Court in December 2017. On May 1st 2020, Bloom posted on Twitter that although she believed Tara Reade was assaulted by the former vice president Joe Biden, she would still support Biden. Personal life Bloom married her current husband, Braden Pollock, on December 5, 2014. Pollock is the founder of Legal Brand Marketing and now works as the Bloom Firm's manager; he is also on the board of Epik, a web services company known for providing services to far-right websites. Bloom lives with her husband and a foster son in Los Angeles. Bloom has two adult children, daughter Sarah Wong Bloom and son Samuel \\"Sam/Sammy\\" Wong, with her former husband Jim Wong, a LAUSD teacher. A vegetarian since 16, Bloom has been vegan since 2009. Although her father was not Jewish, Bloom is. Books Bloom has written three books, including Think: Straight Talk for Women to Stay Smart in a Dumbed-Down World, from 2011, and Swagger: 10 Urgent Rules for Raising Boys in an Era of Failing Schools, Mass Joblessness, and Thug Culture, from 2012. In early 2017, The Weinstein Company and Jay-Z announced plans to adapt Bloom's 2014 book, Suspicion Nation: The Inside Story of the Trayvon Martin Injustice and Why We Continue to Repeat It, into a six-part documentary series. The status of the project is unknown following turmoil at the Weinstein Company.

In non-technical terms, a corner solution is when the chooser is either unwilling or unable to make a tradeoff.  In economics  In economics when someone says \\"I wouldn't buy that at any price\\" or \\"I will do X no matter the cost\\", those are corner solutions. Another example is \\"zero-tolerance\\" policies, or parents who are unwilling to expose their children to any risk, no matter how small and no matter what the benefits of the activity might be. \\"Nothing is more important than my child's safety\\" is a corner solution in its refusal to admit there might be tradeoffs. The term \\"corner solution\\" is sometimes used by economists in a more colloquial fashion to refer to these sorts of situations. The word \\"corner\\" refers to the fact that if one graphs the maximization problem, the optimal point will occur at the \\"corner\\" created by the budget constraint and one axis.  In mathematics  A corner solution is an instance where the \\"best\\" solution (i.e. maximizing profit, or utility, or whatever value is sought) is achieved based not on the market-efficient maximization of related quantities, but rather based on brute-force boundary conditions. Such a solution lacks mathematical elegance, and most examples are characterized by externally forced conditions (such as \\"variables x and y cannot be negative\\") that put the actual local extrema outside the permitted values. Another technical way to state it is that a corner solution is a solution to a minimization or maximization problem where the non-corner solution is infeasible, that is, not in the domain. Instead, the solution is a corner solution on an axis where either x or y is equal to zero. For instance, from the example above in economics, if the maximal utility of two goods is achieved when the quantity of goods x and y are (‚àí2, 5), and the utility is subject to the constraint x and y are greater than or equal to 0 (one cannot consume a negative quantity of goods) as is usually the case, then the actual solution to the problem would be a corner solution where x = 0.  In consumer theory  The more usual solution will lie in the non-zero interior at the point of tangency between the objective function and the constraint. For example, in consumer theory the objective function is the indifference-curve map (the utility function) of the consumer. The budget line is the constraint. In the usual case, constrained utility is maximized on the budget constraint with strictly positive quantities consumed of both goods. For a corner solution, however, utility is maximized at a point on one axis where the budget constraint intersects the highest attainable indifference curve at zero consumption for one good with all income used for the other good. Furthermore, a range of lower prices for the good with initial zero consumption may leave quantity demanded unchanged at zero, rather than increasing it as in the more usual case.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Lesbos, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior It is located in the central part of the island, on the northeast shore of the Bay of Kalloni The village (ai vre kalp, diavol' pathimene) (pop. 2,195 at the 2011 census) is named after the Church of Agia Paraskevi, which is found in a cave in one of the highest points of the town. The town cemetery is also located here. Presumably built over an old pagan temple, there is a well in the cave, and drinking the water from this well has been said to have conferred the Virgin Mary's protection. Agia Paraskevi is an old village that is becoming a powerful cultural and economic center for the island. The village is known for its old mansions, unique architecture and for its festivals. It is often referred to as the ¬´ Little Paris of the Aegean ¬ª (ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœå Œ†Œ±œÅŒØœÉŒπ), due to its quaint agora and stunning architecture. Village layout Municipal school The village contains many traditional houses that shows the Venetian and Roman occupation of the island and is a rare, non-commercialized, non-tourist village -- locals sit at tavernas that line the main street and socialize. The people are quite friendly and get around on foot, moped, horse, mule, or donkey; however, the automobile has largely supplanted animals as the main mode of transportation of both people and farm produce. Near the village at Klopedi, are the remains of the ancient Aeolian temple of Napaios Apollo, while Messa, also nearby, boasts the ruins of a big Ionian temple (late 4th-early 3rd century BC), possibly dedicated to three Greek deities: Zeus, Hera and Dionysos. A monument from a later date, the Early Christian basilica of St. George, restored by the noted mediaevalist, Professor A. Orlandos, may be seen at Halinados, not far away. The school building of Agia Paraskevi is of neoclassical architecture of the early 20th century (1922-1930s), has a rectangular \\"U\\" ground-plan shape, and shows a perfect symmetry at its openings. The formation of the school-yard area is also very significant. The construction of the school building, one of the most attractive on the island, was financed by revenues from the town‚Äôs oil-press, which today has been transformed into a multi-cultural center. The oil press of Agia Paraskevi is a complex of stone-built buildings that serves as a characteristic sample of exceptional industrial architecture of the early 20th century (1910) on the island. Initially, it had been operating as an industrial complex (oil-press and corn-mill) and later on, until 1967, it ran as a community business. In 1984, with the support of the Prefecture of Lesbos, it was restored and transformed into a cultural center. The central building was turned into a multi-cultural hall with a 400-seat capacity, the oil storehouses were converted to a folk art museum while the 11 olives‚Äô storehouses were transformed into modern guest-houses. The only other significant town in the municipal unit of Ag√≠a Paraskev√≠ is N√°pi (pop. 263), about 3 km to the northeast. In the latest census in 2011 the municipal unit had 2,497 residents.

Some modern telephone systems (such as wireless and VoIP) use voice activity detection (VAD), a form of squelching where low volume levels are ignored by the transmitting device. In digital audio transmissions, this saves bandwidth of the communications channel by transmitting nothing when the source volume is under a certain threshold, leaving only louder sounds (such as the speaker's voice) to be sent. However, improvements in background noise reduction technologies can occasionally result in the complete removal of all noise. Although maximizing call quality is of primary importance, exhaustive removal of noise may not properly simulate the typical behavior of terminals on the PSTN system. The result of receiving total silence, especially for a prolonged period, has a number of unwanted effects on the listener, including the following: * the listener may believe that the transmission has been lost, and therefore hang up prematurely. * the speech may sound \\"choppy\\" (see noise gate) and difficult to understand. * the sudden change in sound level can be jarring to the listener. To counteract these effects, comfort noise is added, usually on the receiving end in wireless or VoIP systems, to fill in the silent portions of transmissions with artificial noise. The noise generated is at a low but audible volume level, and can vary based on the average volume level of received signals to minimize jarring transitions. In many VoIP products, users may control how VAD and comfort noise are configured, or disable the feature entirely. As part of the RTP audio video profile, RFC 3389 defines a standard for distributing comfort noise information in VoIP systems. A similar concept is that of sidetone, the effect of sound that is picked up by a telephone's mouthpiece and introduced (at low level) into the earpiece of the same handset, acting as feedback. During the siege of Leningrad, the beat of a metronome was used as comfort noise on the Leningrad radio network, indicating that the network was still functioning.Encyclopaedia of St. Petersburg Many radio stations broadcast birdsong, city-traffic or other atmospheric comfort noise during periods of deliberate silence. For example, in the UK, silence is observed on Remembrance Sunday, and London's quiet city ambiance is used. This is to reassure the listener that the station is on-air, but primarily to prevent silence detection systems at transmitters from automatically starting backup tapes of music (designed to be broadcast in the case of transmission link failure).

Here, goods are state-contingent; that is, a good includes the time and state of the world in which it is consumed. For instance, an umbrella tomorrow if it rains is a distinct good from an umbrella tomorrow if it is clear. The study of complete markets is central to state- preference theory. The theory can be traced to the work of Kenneth Arrow (1964), G√©rard Debreu (1959), Arrow & Debreu (1954) and Lionel McKenzie (1954). Arrow and Debreu were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics (Arrow in 1972, Debreu in 1983), largely for their work in developing the theory of complete markets and applying it to the problem of general equilibrium.  States of the world  A state of the world is a complete specification of the values of all relevant variables over the relevant time horizon. A state-contingent claim, or state claim, is a contract whose future payoffs depend on future states of the world. For example, suppose you can bet on the outcome of a coin toss. If you guess the outcome correctly, you will win one dollar, and otherwise you will lose one dollar. A bet on heads is a state claim, with payoff of one dollar if heads is the outcome, and payoff of negative one dollar if tails is the outcome. \\"Heads\\" and \\"tails\\" are the states of the world in this example. A state-contingent claim can be represented as a payoff vector with one element for each state of the world, e.g. (payoff if heads, payoff if tails). So a bet on heads can be represented as ($1, ‚àí$1) and a bet on tails can be represented as (‚àí$1, $1). Notice that by placing one bet on heads and one bet on tails, you have a state-contingent claim of ($0, $0); that is, the payoff is the same regardless of which state of the world occurs. The bet on a coin toss is a simplistic example but illustrates widely applicable concepts, especially in finance. If markets are complete, it is possible to arrange a portfolio with any conceivable payoff vector. That is, the state claims available for purchase, represented as payoff vectors, span the payoff space. A pure security or simple contingent claim is a state claim that pays off in only one state. Any state-contingent claim can be regarded as a collection of pure securities. A system of markets is complete if and only if the number of attainable pure securities equals the number of possible states. Formally, a market is complete with respect to a trading strategy, s, if there exists a self-financing trading strategy, s_0 such that at any time t, the returns of the two strategies, s and s_0 are equal. This is equivalent to stating that for a complete market, all cash flows for a trading strategy can be replicated using a similar synthetic trading strategy. Because a trading strategy can be simplified into a set of simple contingent claims (strategies paying 1 in one state and 0 in every other state), a complete market can be generalized as the ability to replicate cash flows of all simple contingent claims.  Dynamically complete market  In order for a market to be complete, it must be possible to instantaneously enter into any position regarding any future state of the market. In contrast, a market is called dynamically complete if it is possible to construct a self- financing trading strategy that will have the same cash-flow. In other words, a complete market allows you to place all of your bet at once, while a dynamically complete market may require that you execute subsequent trades after making your initial investment. The requirement that the strategy be self-financing means that subsequent trades must be cash-flow neutral (you cannot contribute or withdraw any additional funds). Any complete market is also dynamically complete.  See also  *Incomplete markets  References   Further reading  * Mark D.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 to 1941, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken. Major was born in Yeovil, Somerset, England, worked in the law office of Athelstan Rendall and migrated to Canada in 1901. He was educated in Manitoba, was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1913, and worked as a barrister- at-law. He also became active as a freemason. Major was chosen as a star candidate of the governing Progressive Party in the 1927 provincial election. In this period of Canadian history, newly appointed cabinet ministers were required to resign their seats and seek the renewed support of their electorate. This was inconvenient for most government leaders, who frequently circumvented the regulation by appointing or shuffling cabinet ministers just before general elections. Major, despite his lack of political experience, was named as Bracken's Attorney General on April 29, 1927, and fought the election in this capacity. He proved an effective campaigner and was elected for Winnipeg, which returned ten members through the single transferable ballot voting method. As Attorney General, Major oversaw construction of the Headingly jail and designed a liquor control act that lasted into the 1950s. He began an extensive revision project of the province's magisterial system in 1930, and was finally able to present his finished report to the legislature in 1940. In 1929, Major and fellow cabinet minister William Clubb became caught up in a conflict-of-interest controversy involving the Winnipeg Electric Company (WEC). Both ministers had purchased shares in the company while negotiations for a government lease were still pending. It may be noted that opposition legislators had also purchased WEC stock during this period, and that Clubb's shares were in fact purchased by prominent Conservative legislator John Thomas Haig. Bracken initially defended both ministers, but was forced to call for their resignations on February 22, 1929. Bracken did not judge the offence to be a serious transgression, and returned both Major and Clubb to their cabinet positions on May 18. On December 31, Major was also named as Minister of Telegraphs and Telephones. The Progressives and Liberals of Manitoba formed an alliance for the 1932 provincial election, after which time government members became known as \\"Liberal-Progressives\\". Major endorsed this alliance, and was handily re-elected in Winnipeg. He was retained in both portfolios after the election. Major emerged as a prominent Liberal- Progressive campaigner in the 1936 election, stressing the Bracken administration's record of fiscal prudence and successful management. He finished fourth on the first count in Winnipeg, and was re-elected on the sixteenth count. He again retained his previous portfolios, and also served as Manitoba's Municipal Commissioner from September 21, 1936 to November 22, 1939. On November 4, 1940, Bracken's Liberal-Progressives entered a four-party coalition government with the Conservatives, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the Social Credit League. Major continued to serve as Attorney- General and Minister of Telephones and Telegraphs, and was given additional responsibilities as Minister of Dominion-Provincial Relations. He was appointed to the Court of the King's Bench just prior to the 1941 provincial election, and resigned his cabinet positions on April 1, 1941. He also headed the Greater Winnipeg Co-ordinating War Services Board during World War II, and led Manitoba's Red Cross campaign in the same period. Major served as a member of the court until 1951, when he was forced to resign due to ill health. He died at home in Winnipeg two years later.

The lemma states that if indifference curves of the expenditure or cost function are convex, then the cost minimizing point of a given good (i) with price p_i is unique. The idea is that a consumer will buy a unique ideal amount of each item to minimize the price for obtaining a certain level of utility given the price of goods in the market. The lemma is named after Ronald Shephard who gave a proof using the distance formula in his book Theory of Cost and Production Functions (Princeton University Press, 1953). The equivalent result in the context of consumer theory was first derived by Lionel W. McKenzie in 1957. It states that the partial derivatives of the expenditure function with respect to the prices of goods equal the Hicksian demand functions for the relevant goods. Similar results had already been derived by John Hicks (1939) and Paul Samuelson (1947). Definition In consumer theory, Shephard's lemma states that the demand for a particular good i for a given level of utility u and given prices \\\\mathbf{p}, equals the derivative of the expenditure function with respect to the price of the relevant good: :h_i(\\\\mathbf{p}, u) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial e (\\\\mathbf{p}, u)}{ \\\\partial p_i} where h_i(\\\\mathbf{p}, u) is the Hicksian demand for good i, e (\\\\mathbf{p}, u) is the expenditure function, and both functions are in terms of prices (a vector \\\\mathbf{p}) and utility u. Likewise, in the theory of the firm, the lemma gives a similar formulation for the conditional factor demand for each input factor: the derivative of the cost function c (\\\\mathbf{w}, y) with respect to the factor price: :x_i(\\\\mathbf{w}, y) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial c (\\\\mathbf{w}, y)}{ \\\\partial w_i} where x_i(\\\\mathbf{w}, y) is the conditional factor demand for input i, c (\\\\mathbf{w}, y) is the cost function, and both functions are in terms of factor prices (a vector \\\\mathbf{w}) and output y. Although Shephard's original proof used the distance formula, modern proofs of the Shephard's lemma use the envelope theorem. Proof for the differentiable case The proof is stated for the two-good case for ease of notation. The expenditure function e(p_{1},p_{2},u) is the minimand of the constrained optimization problem characterized by the following Lagrangian: :\\\\mathcal{L}=p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} + \\\\lambda(u-U(x_{1},x_{2})) By the envelope theorem the derivatives of the minimand e(p_{1},p_{2},u) with respect to the parameter p_{1} can be computed as such: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial e}{\\\\partial p_{1}}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial p_{1}}=x_{1}^{h} where x_{1}^{h} is the minimizer (i.e. the Hicksian demand function for good 1). This completes the proof. Application Shephard's lemma gives a relationship between expenditure (or cost) functions and Hicksian demand. The lemma can be re-expressed as Roy's identity, which gives a relationship between an indirect utility function and a corresponding Marshallian demand function.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on June 19, 2005. It was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and directed by Seth Kearsley. In the episode Peter takes the MacArthur Fellows Program test to see if he is a genius. However, he performs so poorly that he is declared technically mentally retarded. Attempting to take advantage of the situation, he accidentally hospitalizes Lois while attempting to steal from a restaurant and loses custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. The episode's title is a double entendre, being both portmanteau between \\"Peter\\" and \\"Retarded\\" and also a reference to the Shakespeare-coined phrase \\"hoist with his own petard.\\" This title practice would later be used on a few more episodes, namely \\"Peterotica\\" and \\"Petergeist\\". \\"Timer\\", a character from 1970s Saturday morning public service announcements, made an appearance in the episode. Series producers tried to get Lennie Weinrib, the actor who had voiced him in the original cartoon segments, to make a guest appearance in the episode. However, Weinrib declined reprising the role as he could not accurately recall the character. \\"Petarded\\" gained a Nielsen rating of 4.4, making it the week's 42nd most-watched program. Critics and news sources responded with high praise and many regard this episode as Family Guys best. Various scenes in the episode were removed by broadcast censors, including one musical number (\\"Peter is Slow\\"). It features the guest performances of LeVar Burton, Gary Cole, Barclay DeVeau, Indigo, Phil LaMarr, Cloris Leachman, Len Maxwell, Natasha Melnick, Nicole Sullivan, and Lisa Wilhoit, as well as several recurring voice actors for the series. Plot The Griffins invite their neighbors over for game night. While playing Trivial Pursuit, Lois uses questions from the preschool edition for Peter in order to let him win. When Peter wins, he brags to everyone, believing himself to be smarter than everyone else. Irritated at Peter's arrogance, Brian challenges Peter to take the MacArthur Fellows Program test to prove he is a genius. The results of the test show that Peter is not a genius; in fact, the results show that, technically speaking, Peter is \\"mentally retarded.\\" Peter sinks into depression after being publicly labeled as retarded. While driving home with Lois, Peter accidentally knocks down Tom Tucker. Tucker, recognizing Peter as \\"the retarded fellow,\\" does not press charges, and Peter realizes his condition means he can get away with anything. While testing the limits of what he can get away with, such as interrupting church attendants by having a Bible fight, kicking open the stall doors in a girls' bathroom, and saying \\"testicles\\" through a microphone at a fast food restaurant, Peter goes behind the counter and sees a \\"Fryolator\\" and wants to take it home. However, he accidentally drenches Lois with hot grease, scalding her. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie on the grounds that Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks that the best way to do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland‚Äôs house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of his kids, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist. After returning home and accepting that the Griffins may never be together again, Lois walks in, revealing she has completely recovered and reobtained custody of the kids. Peter is overjoyed that everything is back to normal, as well as the fact that Lois will smell like French fries for the next six months. Production Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane came up with the idea for \\"Petarded\\". \\"Petarded\\" was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and directed by former The Goode Family director Seth Kearsley before the conclusion of the fourth production season. Despite Sulkin and Wild writing the episode, the idea for \\"Petarded\\" came from series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane. The episode featured an appearance by \\"Timer\\", a character from 1970s Time for Timer Saturday morning cartoon public service announcements. Seth MacFarlane attempted to hire Lennie Weinrib, the actor who provided his voice for the character to appear in \\"Petarded\\" but, as MacFarlane describes in the DVD commentary, \\"he was a little old ... and he didn't remember doing it\\". Weinrib died one year after the debut of \\"Petarded\\". In the original draft of the episode, Peter being asked easy questions during Trivial Pursuit was meant to be by chance, but executive producer David A. Goodman proposed the storyline of easy questions being given to Peter by Lois. Prior to the episode broadcast, several sequences were shown after Peter discovers he can get away with anything on the basis that he is mentally challenged including a \\"how loud can I yell\\" experiment, as well as tackling down an opponent going for a touchdown while attending a New England Patriots game, but they were not deemed funny enough and scrapped. Various scenes in the episode were changed or removed because of broadcast censors. Originally, just after Peter hands Brian his test results from the MacArthur Program, Peter was to ask \\"Would a retarded person have peed in their pants?\\", then urinate in his trousers. However, because broadcasting standards prohibited this, it was changed to \\"Well, would a mentally retarded guy have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to level half of his house in celebration of his fantastic test results?\\". Brian stating to Peter \\"In your fucking face, Fuckwad\\" after Peter performs poorly on the test was censored from television broadcasting and on the censored track on the DVD, but can be heard uncensored on the uncensored audio track. This marks the first time that the word \\"fuck\\" has been heard uncensored in a Family Guy episode. The Family Guy orchestra sung and recorded a song for a sequence which showed several Quahog citizens learning and talking about Peter being declared as retarded. However, this was removed from the episode because broadcasting standards believed it used the word \\"retarded\\" too many times. After Peter loses custody of the kids, Chris was originally to stay with Mort Goldman, Stewie with Cleveland and Meg with Quagmire. During this original sequence, Mort was to tell Chris that he has two anuses, causing Quagmire to force Meg to lock him in a safe room as he could not trust himself around Meg's friends, but the series was prohibited from broadcasting it by an unknown authority, presumably broadcasting standards. In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane addressed what viewers perceived to be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks through the front door, returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, \\"Some of the fans actually noticed, commented on the fact that this was a very abrupt resolution, but, to that I would say, you're not watching CSI ... wouldn't you rather we throw in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute?\\". In addition to the regular cast, actor LeVar Burton, voice actor Gary Cole, actress Barclay DeVeau, actress Indigo, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actress Cloris Leachman, actor Len Maxwell, actress Natasha Melnick, voice actress Nicole Sullivan, and actress Lisa Wilhoit guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Johnny Brennan, Ralph Garman, writer Mike Henry, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Recurring guest cast member Patrick Warburton reprised his role of Joe Swanson in the episode. Cultural references *The episode is based on the 1985 movie Mask, a film about Roy L. Dennis who suffered from a rare bone disorder. *Lois is seen having developed a tumor due to constantly repressing negative thoughts about having married a mentally retarded man. The tumor sings an altered version of the 1985 Falco song \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\". *Peter is shown taking the MacArthur Fellows Program (also known as the \\"MacArthur Genius Grant\\") in his attempt to prove to Brian that he is a genius. When Peter takes the test, he uses a See 'n' Say instead of a calculator. *The Time for Timer character shown singing and dancing is a reference to public service announcements broadcast in the 1970s on ABC on Saturday mornings (referencing in particular the well-known \\"I Hanker for a Hunk of Cheese\\" episode). When Peter thought what he would do with all his money from the MacArthur Genius Grant, he thought of legally buying Cloris Leachman, forcing her to juggle. Also on the Season 4 DVD commentary, Seth MacFarlane explained he wanted to hire Lennie Weinrib to reprise Timer for the gag, but Weinrib was suffering from failing health when \\"Petarded\\" was being produced and as MacFarlane explained, he \\"didn't remember doing it.\\" Indeed, Lennie Weinrib died about a year after \\"Petarded\\" first aired. *A deleted scene showing Quahog residents singing about Peter being retarded was a reference to music from Bye Bye Birdie. *When Peter is talking about how it was more out of place than when Stewie was in an iPod commercial, the song performed is \\"The Warrior\\" by Scandal. *While stalling in answering a Trivial Pursuit question, Peter arbitrarily mumbles the name of the superhero group The Fantastic Four. *Peter watches an episode of Jake and the Fatman where \\"Fatman\\" McCabe's fatness and laziness is exaggerated. *Vern, Peter's state- appointed inspiration counselor parodies a character of the same name in the movie Rain Man. His reference to Peter as his \\"main man\\" mirrors the movie in which Vern refers to Dustin Hoffman's autistic character in the same way. *When Quagmire complains after being shot by Peter, Peter replies \\"Relax, you're doing better than Peter Weller in the opening scene from RoboCop.\\" This a reference to a scene in the film RoboCop where Peter Weller is on his knees, wearing a police uniform, and is shot repeatedly. *When Cleveland sees the seven prostitutes in his house, Peter says, \\"Seven.

In 2014, to celebrate the show's 15th anniversary, IGN published a list of the 15 best Family Guy episodes, with \\"Petarded\\" ranked the best, saying: \\"The show is at its comedic best with this episode, with musical numbers and family drama to back up the offensive humor.\\" In his review of Family Guy, volume 3, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote \\"... I will say there are some very good episodes in this set, starting with 'Petarded', which sees Peter declared mentally retarded. The ways he takes advantage of this status is classic Family Guy material, while the musical montage here, involving phone calls all over town, is actually quite funny.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1936 to 1941 as a member of the Conservative Party. Barry was born in Winnipeg, the son of Michael Joseph Barry and Ellen Curless, who had come to Manitoba from New Brunswick in 1879. He was educated at St. Mary's and Immaculate Conception Schools. Barry worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway as head clerk of the superintendent's office in Winnipeg. He served on Winnipeg city council from 1921 to 1925. In 1927, he married Delmar Erickson. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1932 provincial election, in the constituency of Winnipeg. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Barry finished seventeenth on the first count, as was defeated on transfers. He fared better in the 1936 election, finishing sixth on the first count and securing election on the sixteenth. The Conservatives lost this election to the Liberal-Progressives, and Barry served on the opposition benches for the next four years. In 1940, the Conservatives joined with the Liberal-Progressives and two other parties in a wartime coalition government. Barry supported the coalition, and served as a government backbencher. Running for re-election in the 1941 election, Barry finished ninth on the first count but fared poorly on transfers. He was eliminated after the eighteenth tally.

He was the hitting coach for the Boston Red Sox in 2004 when they won their first World Series in 86 seasons. From 1975 through 1984, Jackson played first base and third base with the California Angels (1975‚Äì78, 1982‚Äì84), Minnesota Twins (1979‚Äì81), Detroit Tigers (1981) and Baltimore Orioles (1984). He batted and threw right-handed. Jackson was called up to the Angels after hitting .281 in 144 games for the Salt Lake City Gulls of the Pacific Coast League, and made his major league debut on September 12, 1975. In a 10-year career, Jackson compiled a .259 batting average with 56 home runs and 342 RBI in 926 games. Jackson played for managers Gene Mauch, Sparky Anderson, Dick Williams and Jim Fregosi. With the Angels, he hit a career-high .297 in 1978, and in 1979 posted personal highs in hits (158), doubles (40), home runs (14), RBI (68), runs (85) and games (153) for Minnesota. In that season, his .9943 fielding percentage at first base broke Rod Carew's Twins' record. Following his retirement as a player, Jackson coached for the Brewers, Dodgers and White Sox systems. The 2006 season marked his 18th year as a major league or minor league hitting coach, and his fourth with the Boston Red Sox. In his first two seasons with Boston, the Red Sox led the majors in runs, batting average, doubles, extra-base hits, total bases, on-base percentage and slugging average. In 2003 the Sox set ML records for extra-base hits, total bases and slugging, finishing one off the major league lead with 238 home runs. The Red Sox tied an ML record with 373 doubles in 2004. Jackson served as the hitting coach for the Round Rock Express, then the top affiliate of the Houston Astros from 2007 to 2009.

It was intended to inform people about the need to educate the mentally disabled (\\"trainables\\" as they are referred to in the film) about sex and sexuality. Reflecting the views held at the time, the film explains that \\"trainables\\" cannot learn in the same manner as those of normal intelligence, but must instead be trained through repetition. Background The 20 minute video places a high priority on teaching the intellectually disabled about sex so that they will not make inappropriate sexual comments, expose parts of their bodies, masturbate in public, be involved in unplanned pregnancies, or become victims of rape or molestation. It also notes that the goal of teachers should be to explain sexuality in a factual manner, and that views of sexual morality vary between families and should therefore be left for parents to teach. The movie is used in \\"Timmy and the Sex Lesson\\", an episode of The Residents' video series Timmy. Cast The onscreen credits acknowledge that narration was provided by Richard Dix and that dramatic sequences were provided by William Block, M.D., Beverly Camp, Rick Fullerton, Peter Green, Michael Kowalski, Ellen Moats, George Murray, Aaron Orenstein, Christopher Reidy, Murray Zeligman, and members and staff of the Ronald Bruce Nippon Assoc., and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania.  Scenes from the movie  *The opening sequence is of a girl (presumably a mentally disabled person) walking down the street. She is approached by a man in a car who leans out of his window and plays with her hair. She then gets in the back seat of his car and rides away. *A group of teachers are in a workshop together. The instructor encourages the teachers to yell out different slang terms for the penis while she writes them on a chalkboard. This is intended to make the teachers more comfortable with the words so that they will not be embarrassed to teach mentally disabled children about sex. *A man sits with a mentally disabled young man and explains to him about how penises become erect using several drawings. *A man comes into a boy's bedroom, asking him why he has not yet left his bed. The boy replies: \\"I'm all wet and sticky!\\". The man proceeds to explain to the boy what a wet dream is and says he will help him clean up. *A woman comes into her son's bedroom unannounced and discovers him masturbating. She then explains to him that it is good that he is doing it in private, that it feels good, and that someday she and he will have to talk about it and then leaves the room. Reception In 2001, DVD Talk reviewed the Fantoma Films \\"Educational Archives\\" series, Sex & Drugs, and noted The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables as among those included, writing the film had the \\"impact of Freaks\\" and that it was intended to \\"guide teachers in mental institutions, who must try to train (not teach) those patients considered 'trainable', to know enough about their bodies and sex to neither be anti-social nor victimized in public.\\" They commented upon the film addressing the issues directly by its showing \\"some very dedicated teachers taking on a really tough job.\\" When they reviewed the DVD compilation \\"Educational Archives\\" School Locker in 2006, they made note that collections of educational films from Fantoma \\"included the best of the best in educational films\\", and that it was \\"hard to top marvels like The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables,\\" and that while this later compilation was not without merit, \\"it pales in comparison with the earlier releases.\\" DVD Verdict wrote that the film was \\"the flip side of all those sex education films directed at children\\", in how the \\"well-meaning short teaches teachers how to handle sex education for \\"retardates,\\" or the developmentally disabled.\\" They noted that the film tended to be more graphic when compared to the other films included on the \\"Educational Archives\\" series, Sex & Drugs, and though it tried \\"very hard to take its subject seriously.

This parasite is the most frequent and widely distributed cause of recurring malaria. Although it is less virulent than Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of the five human malaria parasites, P. vivax malaria infections can lead to severe disease and death, often due to splenomegaly (a pathologically enlarged spleen). P. vivax is carried by the female Anopheles mosquito; the males do not bite.  Health  = Epidemiology = Plasmodium vivax is found mainly in Asia, Latin America, and in some parts of Africa. P. vivax is believed to have originated in Asia, but latest studies have shown that wild chimpanzees and gorillas throughout central Africa are endemically infected with parasites that are closely related to human P. vivax. These findings indicate that human P. vivax is of African origin. Plasmodium vivax accounts for 65% of malaria cases in Asia and South America. Unlike Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax is capable of undergoing sporogonic development in the mosquito at lower temperatures. It has been estimated that 2.5 billion people are at risk of infection with this organism. Although the Americas contribute 22% of the global area at risk, high endemic areas are generally sparsely populated and the region contributes only 6% to the total population at risk. In Africa, the widespread lack of the Duffy antigen in the population has ensured that stable transmission is constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn of Africa. It contributes 3.5% of global population at risk. Central Asia is responsible for 82% of global population at risk with high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations particularly in India and Myanmar. South East Asia has areas of high endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and overall contributes 9% of global population at risk. P. vivax is carried by at least 71 mosquito species. Many vivax vectors live happily in temperate climates‚Äîas far north as Finland. Some prefer to bite outdoors or during the daytime, hampering the effectiveness of indoor insecticide and bed nets. Several key vector species have yet to be grown in the lab for closer study, and insecticide resistance is unquantified. = Clinical presentation = Pathogenesis results from rupture of infected red blood cells, leading to fever. Infected red blood cells may also stick to each other and to walls of capillaries. Vessels plug up and deprive tissues of oxygen. Infection may also cause the spleen to enlarge. Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax can populate the bloodstream with sexual-stage parasites--the form picked up by mosquitoes on their way to the next victim--even before a patient shows symptoms. Consequently, prompt treatment of symptomatic patients doesn't necessarily help stop an outbreak, as it does with falciparum malaria, in which fevers occur as sexual stages develop. Even when symptoms appear, because they are usually not immediately fatal, the parasite continues to multiply. Plasmodium vivax can cause a more unusual form of malaria with atypical symptoms. It has been known to debut with hiccups, loss of taste, lack of fever, pain while swallowing, cough and urinary discomfort. The parasite can go dormant in the liver for days to years, causing no symptoms and remaining undetectable in blood tests. They form what are called hypnozoites, a small stage that nestles inside an individual liver cell. This name derives from ‚Äúsleeping organisms‚Äù. The hypnozoites allow the parasite to survive in more temperate zones, where mosquitoes bite only part of the year. A single infectious bite can trigger six or more relapses a year, leaving sufferers more vulnerable to other diseases. Other infectious diseases, including falciparum malaria, appear to trigger relapses. = Serious complications = Serious complications for malaria are dormant liver stage parasites, organ failures such as acute kidney failure. More complications of malaria can also be impairment of consciousness, neurological abnormalities, hypoglycemia and low blood pressures caused by cardiovascular collapse, clinical jaundice and or other vital organ dysfunctions and coagulation defects. The most serious complication ultimately being death. =Prevention= The main way to prevent malaria is through vector control. There are mostly three main forms that the vector can be controlled: (1) insecticide-treated mosquito nets, (2) indoor residual spraying and (3) antimalarial drugs. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLNs) are the preferred method of control because it is the most cost effective. The WHO is currently strategizing how to ensure that the net is properly maintained to protect people at risk. The second option is indoor residual spraying and has been proven effective if at least 80% of the homes are sprayed. However, such method is only effective for 3-6months. A drawback to these two methods, unfortunately, is that mosquito resistance against these insecticides has risen. National malaria control efforts are undergoing rapid changes to ensure the people are given the most effective method of vector control. Lastly, antimalarial drugs can also be used to prevent infection from developing into a clinical disease. However, there has also been an increase resistance to antimalarial medicine. In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) drew up a plan to address vivax malaria, as part of their Global Technical Strategy for Malaria. = Diagnosis = P. vivax and P. ovale that has been sitting in EDTA for more than 30 minutes before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to P. malariae, which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives. Blood films are preferably made within 30 minutes of the blood draw and must certainly be made within an hour of the blood being drawn. Diagnosis can be done with the strip fast test of antibodies. = Treatment = Chloroquine remains the treatment of choice for vivax malaria, except in Indonesia's Irian Jaya (Western New Guinea) region and the geographically contiguous Papua New Guinea, where chloroquine resistance is common (up to 20% resistance). Chloroquine resistance is an increasing problem in other parts of the world, such as Korea and India. When chloroquine resistance is common or when chloroquine is contraindicated, then artesunate is the drug of choice, except in the U.S., where it is not approved for use. Where an artemisinin-based combination therapy has been adopted as the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria, it may also be used for P. vivax malaria in combination with primaquine for radical cure. An exception is artesunate plus sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine (AS+SP), which is not effective against P. vivax in many places. Mefloquine is a good alternative and in some countries is more readily available. Atovaquone-proguanil is an effective alternative in patients unable to tolerate chloroquine. Quinine may be used to treat vivax malaria but is associated with inferior outcomes. 32-100% of patients will relapse following successful treatment of P. vivax infection if a radical cure (eradication of liver stages) is not given. Eradication of the liver stages is achieved by giving primaquine. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk haemolysis. G6PD is an enzyme important for blood chemistry. No field- ready test is available. Recently, this point has taken particular importance for the increased incidence of vivax malaria among travelers. At least a 14-day course of primaquine is required for the radical treatment of P. vivax.  Tafenoquine  In 2013 a Phase IIb trial was completed that studied a single-dose alternative drug named tafenoquine. It is an 8-aminoquinoline, of the same family as primaquine, developed by researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the 1970s and tested in safety trials. It languished, however, until the push for malaria elimination sparked new interest in primaquine alternatives. Among patients who received a 600-mg dose, 91% were relapse-free after 6 months. Among patients who received primaquine, 24% relapsed within 6 months. \\"The data are absolutely spectacular,\\" Wells says. Ideally, he says, researchers will be able to combine the safety data from the Army's earlier trials with the new study in a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval. Like primaquine, tafenoquine causes hemolysis in people who are G6PD deficient. In 2013 researchers produced cultured human \\"microlivers\\" that supported liver stages of both P. falciparum and P. vivax and may have also created hypnozoites. = Eradication = Mass-treating populations with a primaquine can kill the hypnozoites, exempting those with G6PD deficiency. However, the standard regimen requires a daily pill for 14 days across an asymptomatic population.  Korea  P. vivax is the only indigenous malaria parasite on the Korean peninsula. In the years following the Korean War (1950‚Äì53), malaria-eradication campaigns successfully reduced the number of new cases of the disease in North Korea and South Korea. In 1979, World Health Organization declared the Korean peninsula vivax malaria-free, but the disease unexpectedly re-emerged in the late 1990s and still persists today. Several factors contributed to the re-emergence of the disease, including reduced emphasis on malaria control after 1979, floods and famine in North Korea, emergence of drug resistance and possibly global warming. Most cases are identified along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. As such, vivax malaria offers the two Koreas an opportunity to work together on an important health problem that affects both countries. = Drug Targets = Given that drugs that target the various life stages of the parasite can sometimes have undesirable side effects, it is desirable to come up with drug molecules targeting specific proteins/enzymes that are essential for the parasite's survival or that can compromise the fitness of the organism. Enzymes in the Purine salvage pathway had been favorite targets to this end. However, given the high degree of conservation in purine metabolism across the parasite and its host, there could be potential cross-reactivity making it difficult to design selective drugs against the parasite. To overcome this, recent efforts have focused on deducing the function of orphan hypothetical proteins whose functions have been unknown. Though, a lot of the hypothetical proteins have role in secondary metabolism, targeting them will be beneficial from two perspectives, i.e., specificity and reducing the virulence of the pathogen with no or minimal undesirable cross-reactivities.  Biology  = Life cycle = Like all malaria parasites, P. vivax has a complex life cycle. It infects a definitive insect host, where sexual reproduction occurs, and an intermediate vertebrate host, where asexual amplification occurs. In P. vivax, the definitive hosts are Anopheles mosquitoes (also known as the vector), while humans are the intermediate asexual hosts. During its life cycle, P. vivax assumes many different physical forms. Asexual forms: * Sporozoite: Transfers infection from mosquito to human * Immature trophozoites (Ring or signet-ring shaped), about 1/3 of the diameter of a RBC. * Mature trophozoites: Very irregular and delicate (described as amoeboid); many pseudopodial processes seen. Presence of fine grains of brown pigment (malarial pigment) or hematin probably derived from the haemoglobin of the infected red blood cell. * Schizonts (also called meronts): As large as a normal red cell; thus the parasitized corpuscle becomes distended and larger than normal. There are about sixteen merozoites. Sexual forms: * Gametocytes: Round. P. vivax gametocytes are commonly found in human peripheral blood at about the end of the first week of parasitemia. * Gametes: Formed from gametocytes in mosquitoes. * Zygote: Formed from combination of gametes * Oocyst: Contains zygote, develops into sporozoites  Human infection  P. vivax human infection occurs when an infected mosquito feeds on a human. During feeding, the mosquito injects saliva to prevent blood clotting (along with sporozoites), thousands of sporozoites are inoculated into human blood; within a half-hour the sporozoites reach the liver. There they enter hepatic cells, transform into the trophozoite form and feed on hepatic cells, and reproduce asexually. This process gives rise to thousands of merozoites (plasmodium daughter cells) in the circulatory system and the liver. The incubation period of human infection usually ranges from ten to seventeen days and sometimes up to a year. Persistent liver stages allow relapse up to five years after elimination of red blood cell stages and clinical cure. = Liver stage = The P. vivax sporozoite enters a hepatocyte and begins its exoerythrocytic schizogony stage. This is characterized by multiple rounds of nuclear division without cellular segmentation. After a certain number of nuclear divisions, the parasite cell will segment and merozoites are formed. There are situations where some of the sporozoites do not immediately start to grow and divide after entering the hepatocyte, but remain in a dormant, hypnozoite stage for weeks or months. The duration of latency is thought to be variable from one hypnozoite to another and the factors that will eventually trigger growth are not known; this might explain how a single infection can be responsible for a series of waves of parasitaemia or \\"relapses\\". It has been assumed that different strains of P. vivax have their own characteristic relapse pattern and timing. However, such recurrent parasitaemia is probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation. One newly recognized, non- hypnozoite, possible contributing source to recurrent peripheral P. vivax parasitaemia is erythrocytic forms in bone marrow. = Erythrocytic cycle = P. vivax preferentially penetrates young red blood cells (reticulocytes), unlike Plasmodium falciparum which can invade erythrocytes. In order to achieve this, merozoites have two proteins at their apical pole (PvRBP-1 and PvRBP-2). The parasite uses the Duffy blood group antigens (Fy6) to penetrate red blood cells. This antigen does not occur in the majority of humans in West Africa [phenotype Fy (a-b-)]. As a result, P. vivax occurs less frequently in West Africa. The parasitised red blood cell is up to twice as large as a normal red cell and Sch√ºffner's dots (also known as Sch√ºffner's stippling or Sch√ºffner's granules) are seen on the infected cell's surface. Sch√ºffner's dots have a spotted appearance, varying in color from light pink, to red, to red-yellow, as coloured with Romanovsky stains. The parasite within it is often wildly irregular in shape (described as \\"amoeboid\\"). Schizonts of P. vivax have up to twenty merozoites within them. It is rare to see cells with more than one parasite within them. Merozoites will only attach to immature blood cell (reticulocytes) and therefore it is unusual to see more than 3% of all circulating erythrocytes parasitised.  Mosquito stage  Parasite life cycle in mosquitoes includes all stages of sexual reproduction: # Infection and Gametogenesis #* Microgametes #* Macrogametes # Fertilization # Ookinite # Oocyst # Sporogony = Mosquito Infection and Gamete Formation = When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes and other stages of the parasite are transferred to the mosquito stomach. Gametocytes ultimately develop into gametes, a process known as gametogony. Microgametocytes become very active, and their nuclei undergo fission (i.e. amitosis) to each give 6-8 daughter nuclei, which becomes arranged at the periphery. The cytoplasm develops long thin flagella like projections, then a nucleus enter into each one of these extensions. These cytoplasmic extensions later break off as mature male gametes (microgametes). This process of formation of flagella-like microgametes or male gametes is known as exflagellation. Macrogametocytes show very little change. They develop a cone of reception at one side and becomes mature as macrogametocytes (female gametes). = Fertilization = Male gametes move actively in the stomach of mosquitoes in search of female gametes. Male gametes then enter into female gametes through the cone of reception. The complete fusion of 2 gametes results in the formation of zygote. Here, fusion of 2 dissimilar gametes occurs, known as anisogamy. The zygote remains inactive for sometime but it soon elongates, becomes vermiform (worm-like) and motile. It is now known as ookinete. The pointed ends of ookinete penetrate the stomach wall and come to lie below its outer epithelial layer. Here the zygote becomes spherical and develops a cyst wall around itself. The cyst wall is derived partly from the stomach tissues and partly produced by the zygote itself. At this stage, the zygote is known as an oocyst. The oocyst absorbs nourishment and grows in size. Oocysts protrude from the surface of stomach, giving it a blistered appearance. In a highly infected mosquito, as many as 1000 oocysts may be seen. = Sporogony = The oocyst nucleus divides repeatedly to form large number of daughter nuclei. At the same time, the cytoplasm develops large vacuoles and forms numerous cytoplasmic masses. These cytoplasmic masses then elongate and a daughter nuclei migrates into each mass. The resulting sickle-shaped bodies are known as sporozoites. This phase of asexual multiplication is known as sporogony and is completed in about 10‚Äì21 days. The oocyst then bursts and sporozoites are released into the body cavity of mosquito. Sporozoites eventually reach the salivary glands of mosquito via its hemolymph. The mosquito now becomes infectious. Salivary glands of a single infected mosquito may contain as many as 200,000 sporozoites. When the mosquito bites a healthy person, thousands of sporozoites are infected into the blood along with the saliva and the cycle starts again. = Taxonomy = P. vivax can be divided into two clades one that appears to have origins in the Old World and a second that originated in the New World. The distinction can be made on the basis of the structure of the A and S forms of the rRNA. A rearrangement of these genes appears to have occurred in the New World strains. It appears that a gene conversion occurred in an Old World strain and this strain gave rise to the New World strains. The timing of this event has yet to be established. At present both types of P. vivax circulate in the Americas. The monkey parasite - Plasmodium simium - is related to the Old World strains rather than to the New World strains. A specific name - Plasmodium collinsi - has been proposed for the New World strains but this suggestion has not been accepted to date. = Miscellaneous = It has been suggested that P. vivax has horizontally acquired genetic material from humans. Plasmodium vivax is not known to have a particular gram stain (negative vs. positive) and may appear as either. There is evidence that P. vivax is itself infected by viruses.  Therapeutic use  P. vivax was used between 1917 and the 1940s for malariotherapy, that is, to create very high fevers to combat certain diseases such as tertiary syphilis. In 1917, the inventor of this technique, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries. However, the technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.

He is the 'IT Security Journalist of the Year (UK) 2010', an award he has won three times (2006, 2008, 2010). Biography After viral encephalitis left him severely disabled, he first got a computer to use video games to improve the coordination in the remaining arm in which he had the power of movement. He then used a word processor to learn how to read and write again, with the help of his late father and numerous Janet and John kids' books. The disease had also changed his personality, devastating his marriage and social life. After experiments with Prestel, he found an early British online community, CIX, in the late 1980s, before direct connections to the internet were cheaply available outside academia, and this provided him with a new social and business life. Winder was contacted through CIX email over the internet by technological culture writer Howard Rheingold, a habitu√© of The Well, another early online community-based in the United States, and eventually the two met in person at Winder's home; the meeting is described in Rheingold's book, The Virtual Community. A prolific author himself, Winder has had more than 20 books published. The most recent, Being Virtual, in conjunction with the Science Museum, in London which explores the realm of virtual identity and is part auto-biographical in nature. Winder is now fully recovered and no longer needs a wheelchair.

Playing career A native of Fort William, Ontario, Bodnar started his career with the local Fort William Rangers of the Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League. He played for the Rangers for three seasons from 1941‚Äì43 and competed for the Memorial Cup twice in 1941‚Äì42 and 1942‚Äì43. After leading the TBJHL in points in 1942‚Äì43, Bodnar joined the Toronto Maple Leafs. On October 30, 1943, Bodnar scored his first ever NHL goal 15 seconds in his first NHL game, setting the record for fastest goal by a player in his first NHL game. Bodnar scored 62 points during the regular season, a career best, and he beat Montreal Canadiens rookie goaltender Bill Durnan in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1943‚Äì44. He spent four more seasons with the Maple Leafs and won two Stanley Cups in 1944‚Äì45 and 1946‚Äì47. Bodnar had 40 assists in his rookie season in 1943‚Äì44, which would set a record for assists by a Maple Leafs rookie until surpassed by Mitch Marner in 2016‚Äì17. In 1947‚Äì48, Bodnar and fellow linemates Gaye Stewart, Ernie Dickens, Bud Poile and Bob Goldham were traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Max Bentley and Cy Thomas.

BICC signaling messages are nearly identical to those in ISDN User Part (ISUP); the main difference being that the narrowband circuit identification code (CIC) has been modified. The BICC architecture consists of interconnected serving nodes that provide the call service function and the bearer control function. The call service function uses BICC signaling for call setup and may also interwork with ISUP. The bearer control function receives directives from the call service function via BICC Bearer Control Protocol (ITU-T recommendation Q.1950) and is responsible for setup and teardown of bearer paths on a set of physical transport links. Transport links are most commonly Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Internet Protocol (IP). According to the ITU, the completion of the BICC protocols is a historic step toward broadband multimedia networks because it enables the seamless migration from circuit-switched TDM networks to high-capacity broadband multimedia networks.

The complex now houses the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). One component of the complex was originally called the New Post Office, and housed the headquarters of the Post Office Department until that department was replaced by the United States Postal Service in 1971 and which vacated the building. Subsequently, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) occupied this building, which Congress renamed as the Ariel Rios Federal Building in 1985. BATFE vacated the building in the early 1990s, and EPA moved in after a renovation. To consolidate its headquarters offices, EPA also took occupancy of two adjacent buildings beginning in the late 1990s: the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) building and the Department of Labor Building, on Constitution Avenue, NW. In 2013 Congress renamed the Ariel Rios Federal Building in honor of former President Bill Clinton, and the General Services Administration extended the designation to the former ICC and Labor buildings. (The new BATFE headquarters building received the name Ariel Rios Federal Building in 2016.) History In the early 1930s, the area that was to become the Federal Triangle was one of the city's most blighted neighborhoods, known as Murder Bay and was a center of crime and prostitution.\\"Ariel Rios Building, Washington, D.C.\\". (General Services Administration official site). Retrieved May 18, 2008. The plan for the area's redevelopment was laid out as part of the 1901 McMillan Plan, the first federally funded urban redevelopment plan, and the redevelopment of Federal Triangle began in earnest in the 1930s under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon. =Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium= The United States General Services Administration designates some historical events which occurred at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium as historical events which occurred at the Clinton Building. =New Post Office Building= Construction of the New Post Office Building was completed in 1934. The Post Office headquarters was a central feature of the redevelopment. The neoclassical building was designed by architects William Adams Delano and Chester Holmes Aldrich, who took as their inspiration the Place Vend√¥me in Paris. The central section of the tri-unit building consists of two huge, back to back, semicircular units with side wings. The semicircle formed by the building's curve on its eastern fa√ßade was to be mirrored by a similarly curved fa√ßade built across 12th Street on the site of the Old Post Office Building. Secretary Mellon's building commission actively sought the demolition of the Old Post Office to fulfill that plan, but preservation efforts‚Äîwhich continued over the course of 50 years‚Äîsaved the Old Post Office. The second half of the grand plaza was never finished as designed, save for a curve in the northwest corner of the headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service. (The nearby Ronald Reagan Building, completed in 1998, does mirror, to some degree, the semicircle of the west fa√ßade of the Clinton Building.) The exterior is decorated with bas relief panels, by Adolph Alexander Weinman. The original design of the headquarters building included a local branch post office, called Benjamin Franklin Station. This branch, with entrances on Pennsylvania Avenue, is extant as of 2018. In the 1990s, the General Services Administration (GSA) refurbished the former Post Office building with the architectural details of the hallways preserved in the style of the 1920s and 1930s. A seven-story marble spiral staircase is a prominent element of the building's interior. A chandelier hangs in the center of the staircase and has exposed bulbs to illuminate each floor. It terminates in a dramatic chrome and brass globe. =Department of Labor Building= Arthur Brown, Jr. designed the Labor building between 1928 and 1931, and construction was completed in 1934. The building entrance is at 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW. The Department of Labor was the original occupant of the building. It vacated the building in 1979 when its employees moved to the Frances Perkins Building. The Customs Service took occupancy in 1979 and remained until the late 1990s, when it moved to the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. In 2002 EPA moved in, and the building was designated as the \\"EPA West\\" building. =Interstate Commerce Commission Building= Arthur Brown, Jr. designed the ICC Building, completed in 1934, in a style similar to the Labor building.

Murals The Clinton Federal Building was one of the initial locations that integrated various Works Progress Administration (WPA) murals that were originally commissioned and displayed in federally constructed buildings during the 1930s and 1940s. 25 murals were chosen and six have been criticized by visitors and employees as to stereotyping American Indians and integrating inappropriate images. GSA addressed the controversy: > The U.S. Post Office headquarters murals embody many admirable qualities of > American art and culture in the 1930s: a range of visual styles, inventive > approaches to subject matter, commitment to bringing creativity and artistic > beauty to public spaces, and devotion to the development of American art as > a part of national identity.

This belief is held by proponents of free grace theology who believe that an individual will inherit the kingdom of heaven if they have been regenerated; while Reformed theology also teaches this doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, it holds that one's continued belief in Christ and good works are evidence of one's saving faith and that if one does not bear this fruit, he/she was never truly regenerated to begin with. Catholic, Methodist, and Eastern Orthodox theology hold to synergism with respect to salvation and view the doctrine of eternal security as heretical, instead teaching that one's one's salvation is conditional on one's continued faith, good works, sanctification, and avoidance of sin. Views =Theology affirming the doctrine of Eternal security= Reformed Christianity In Calvinism, eternal security is a logical consequence of the doctrine of perseverance of the saints, according to which true Christians will persevere in good works and faith. Because faith is God's perfect gift it will inevitably produce perseverance in faith and good works. Thus condemnation to hell because of sin, unbelief, or apostasy is not possible for true Christians. Free grace Free grace theology says that anyone who believes in Jesus Christ will go to heaven regardless of any future actions‚Äîincluding future sin, unbelief, or apostasy‚Äîthough Christians who sin or abandon the faith will face God's discipline. =Theology rejecting the doctrine of Eternal Security= Catholicism In Catholicism, Christians do not have eternal security because they can commit a mortal sin. The Church teach that Christians are subject to the cleansing torment of purgatory before entrance into heaven. Classical Arminianism and Wesleyan Arminianism The Arminian view, inclusive of the Classical Arminian position and Wesleyan- Arminian (Methodist) position, opposes any concept of eternal security, holding that a true Christian can fall from grace and be condemned to hell.

His television series debuted in January 1951 on WJZ-TV (later WABC-TV), moving to WOR-TV (later WWOR-TV) in 1962, remaining there until 1993, one of the longest running uninterrupted careers in broadcasting history. Early life Franklin was born Joseph Fortgang on March 9, 1926, in The Bronx, New York, the elder of two children, to Austrian Jewish parents, Anna (Heller) and Martin Fortgang. He acknowledged in his memoirs, Up Late With Joe Franklin, (which was written with R. J. Marx), that his press materials had long said, purposely, that he had been born in 1928, but he planned to come clean about his real birth date. As a teenager, Franklin \\"followed around\\" Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor, the latter of whom eventually began buying jokes from the young Franklin and whose Carnegie Hall show he later produced. At age 18, Franklin was drafted into the United States Army, serving in World War II.Joe Franklin dies at 88; interviewed 'plate twirlers' and stars. Los Angeles Times via Internet Archive. Retrieved August 13, 2020.Joe Franklin, NNDB Tracking the Entire World. NNDB. Retrieved August 13, 2020. Career At 14, Franklin began writing skits for The Kate Smith Hour; and at 16, Franklin officially began his entertainment career as a record picker on radio sensation Martin Block's Make Believe Ballroom where he became known as \\"The Young Wreck with the Old Records\\". By the time he was 21, he embarked on a radio career. He was also considered to be an authority on popular culture of the first half of the 20th century, including silent films. He was called \\"The King of Nostalgia\\" and \\"The Wizard of Was\\" for focusing on old-time show-business personalities. Franklin was also a pioneer in promoting products such as Hoffman Beverages and Canada Dry ginger ale on the air. A&E;'s documentary It's Only Talk, The Real Story Of America's Talk Shows credits Franklin as the creator of the television talk show. Franklin was listed in the Guinness World Records as the longest running continuous on-air TV talk show host, more than a decade longer than Johnny Carson's run. In 1999, Franklin partnered with Producer Steve Garrin and Restaurant Mogul Dennis Riese to open Joe Franklin's Memory Lane Restaurant at 45th Street and Eighth Avenue in New York City. The restaurant converted to become Joe Franklin's Comedy Club. The club ceased operations after losing its lease in 2003. After retiring from his television show, Franklin concentrated on his overnight radio show, playing old records on WOR- AM on Saturday evenings and mentoring thousands of aspiring entertainers who for decades sought an audience with him at his notoriously cluttered Times Square office. Franklin's celebrity interviews, known as \\"Nostalgia Moments\\", appeared daily on the Bloomberg Radio Network until mid-January 2015, shortly before his death. Famous guests Franklin's guests included an odd mix of actual celebrities and low level performers, sometimes on the same panel. He claimed to have had Charlie Chaplin on his program, a dubious statement since Chaplin left the United States in 1952, shortly after Franklin's TV debut. Other guest claims include John Wayne, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe (with whom Franklin co-authored \\"The Marilyn Monroe Story\\" in 1953), Jayne Mansfield, The Beastie Boys, Cary Grant, Sam Levene, Andy Warhol, Lena Horne, Tony Bennett, Salvador Dali, Rudy Vallee, Jimmy Durante, Madonna, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Bing Crosby, Jerry Lewis, Roger Williams, The Belmonts, Elvis Presley, The Ramones, Lou Albano and five US presidents (including John F.

As with the Chaplin claim, some of these appearances were unable to be independently confirmed based on a lack of evidence, since still pictures taken on the set do not exist for several of the people listed, and little video from before the 1970s survives. Bette Midler was the show's in-house singer for a time, and Elizabeth Joyce was his in-house psychic/astrologer. Franklin never employed a co-host, but his producer, Richie Ornstein, was a standard feature on the Joe Franklin Show who interacted with guests and discussed trivia. Woody Allen, Andy Kaufman, Liza Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, Julia Roberts, Bruce Springsteen, Robin Williams, John Belushi and Richard Pryor got their first television exposure on The Joe Franklin Show. Frank Sinatra reportedly appeared four times. In December 2000, Franklin partnered with producer Steve Garrin and restaurant mogul Dennis Riese to open \\"Joe Franklin's Memory Lane Restaurant\\" on West 45th Street in Broadway's theater district,\\"Joe Franklin's Memory Lane Bar & Restaurant is NOW OPEN...\\", JoeFranklin.com; accessed January 26, 2015. where Franklin appeared frequently and conducted live, in-person interviews with entertainers such as Carol Channing, Anita O'Day and Billy Crystal, who impersonated Franklin on Saturday Night Live. After the restaurant closed in 2004 it reopened the following year as \\"Joe Franklin's Comedy Club\\" on West 50th Street. Many name comedians came to the club and performed on stage to break in their new material, and many aspiring comics got their first stage time there. That venue closed in 2005. In media Franklin appeared as himself in such New York-based films as Ghostbusters, Broadway Danny Rose, and 29th Street. Franklin appeared on the first episode of This American Life giving host Ira Glass advice on how to have a successful show. He was also a guest on an early episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. He also made appearances in various works by New York low- budget film company Troma Entertainment, making a cameo as himself in their 1999 meta-fictional slasher film Terror Firmer, as well as the 1993 infomercial The Troma System as the result of the commercial's host transforming into \\"the ultimate talk show host\\". Franklin appeared as himself in comedian Tracey Ullman‚Äôs 1993 HBO comedy special Tracey Ullman Takes on New York, interviewing character Linda Granger on his talk show. Franklin's show was first parodied by Billy Crystal during the 1984‚Äì1985 season of Saturday Night Live. On the locally produced program The Uncle Floyd Show, host Floyd Vivino parodied Franklin as \\"Joe Frankfurter\\". In 1997, Franklin was profiled in the documentary film 50,000,000 Joe Franklin Fans Can't Be Wrong (1997), directed by Joshua Brown. Also in 1997, Franklin was satirized by Drew Friedman in * Any Similarity to Persons Living or Dead is Purely Coincidental (with Josh Alan Friedman) (Fantagraphics Books, 1997) In the 2005 film The Aristocrats, comedian Sarah Silverman tells a facetious story about Franklin raping her as a child.

It begins at an interchange with the Bronx River Parkway in the city of Yonkers, and ends at the former site of the Hawthorne Circle, where it merges into the Taconic State Parkway. The parkway serves an alternate to the Bronx River Parkway, boasting an interchange connection through western Westchester with Interstate 287\\\\. New York's Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) refers to it internally as New York State Route 987F (NY 987F), an unsigned reference route. The Sprain Brook was first proposed in the early 1920s as a parkway between the Bronx River Parkway and the Hawthorne Circle. The parkway sold a majority of its right-of-way in the 1920s, but the proposed parkway met strong opposition from the village of Bronxville and Yonkers. The Sprain Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on the Bronx River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the Sprain Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative to the Bronx River, and nearly a decade and a half after the parkway was deeded land. This time, Bronxville opposed the project rather than Yonkers, but an agreement was worked out in 1951. This new alignment would bypass the parts of Bronxville and Yonkers to construct the freeway. Construction of the alternative highway began in 1958, with the stretch from the Bronx River Parkway to Tuckahoe Road. This section was completed in 1961. The next piece, from Tuckahoe Road to Jackson Avenue, was constructed during 1962 and 1963, with it opening in the latter. Construction continued to the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287) and was completed in 1969. At this point, the last missing piece was between the Cross Westchester and the Hawthorne Circle. This piece was delayed until 1976, when construction began on the last of parkway. The last piece of the parkway was opened on October 28, 1980 at the cost of $25 million (1980 USD). From its opening in 1961 until 1979, the parkway was maintained by the East Hudson Parkway Authority, a commission created to maintain tolls on the Saw Mill River Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway and to provide general maintenance for the Taconic State Parkway. The authority was abolished in 1979, at which time, all maintenance of the Sprain Brook Parkway was turned over to NYSDOT. Route description Sprain Brook Parkway southbound lanes during the fork for the Grassy Sprain Reservoir The Sprain Brook Parkway, designated by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY 987F, a state reference route, begins at a fork from the Bronx River Parkway along the latter's right-of-way along the Bronx River in the city of Yonkers. Crossing through the Northeast Yonkers neighborhood as a six-lane freeway design, the Sprain Brook crosses an interchange with NY 100 (Central Park Avenue) south of Andrus Park. Bending to the north through Yonkers, the Sprain Brook reaches an interchange with Tuckahoe Road, with the northbound and southbound lanes splitting around the Grassy Sprain Reservoir. The two directions bend northeast along the reservoir. The southbound lanes cross Sprain Ridge Park, while the northbound lanes cross through a golf course. Leaving Yonkers for the town of Greenburgh, the lanes of the Sprain Brook come back together, reaching an interchange with Jackson Avenue. The six lane parkway continues northward and to the northeast through Greenburgh, crossing under Ardsley Road. After turning northward once again, the Sprain Brook crosses under a former alignment of NY 131 (Underhill Road) and passes by the Sunningdale Country Club. The Sprain Brook at the junction with NY 100 and NY 100C in Greenburgh Continuing its north/northeast winding, the Sprain Brook enters an interchange with NY 100B (Dobbs Ferry Road), passing by East Rumbrook Park. Crossing over NY 119 in Elmsford, the parkway enters an interchange with Interstate 287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). After crossing through the interchange, the Spain continues northward as a six-lane parkway back through the town of Greenburgh, entering an interchange with NY 100C (Grasslands Road). Paralleling NY 100 to the west, the parkway, bending northward into Mount Pleasant and an interchange with County Route 301 (Bradhurst Entrance North Road), which connects to NY 100 (Bradhurst Avenue). North of that junction, the southbound lanes of the Sprain Brook interchange with a crossing NY 100\\\\. After several bends to the north, the Sprain Brook enters the merging Taconic State Parkway and terminates as the right-of-way continues as the Taconic. The Sprain Brook Parkway sees an average of 95,442 vehicles per day throughout its entire length. The stretch between I-287 and NY 100C sees the highest amount, with 101,460 cars in a 2011 report. The stretch between NY 100 in Yonkers and Jackson Avenue in Greenburgh sees the second-highest, at 100,900, which is an upgrade of over 19,000 vehicles since the same report in 1997. History = Original proposal = What ultimately became the Sprain Brook Parkway began taking form in the 1920s, when the Westchester County Road Commission acquired the right-of-way for a planned extension of the Taconic State Parkway. The land, bought from 1925 to 1927 for $1.5 million ($ in modern dollars), was, however, not used as a parkway, and in 1938, was proposed to be used instead as an arterial state highway, rather than a parkway. The commission sent a request in April 1938 to the State Council of Parks to have the state take over the right-of-way after the state withdrew its support for the parkway extension. In April 1938, the county was approached by the Westchester County Park Commission to transfer the new project to the state for construction by the State Council of Parks. The project, which at the time would have cost $7 million ($ in modern dollars), was to connect to the Robert Moses-proposed highway between New York City and Albany. Opposition to this plan was immediate. Yonkers officials publicly disapproved, saying that the county would lose any hope for state aid. In January 1939, the village of Bronxville joined the opposition, deeming the new parkway as a \\"needless expenditure of public money\\" that would adversely affect local property values and cause flooding. At the same time, proposals in the state legislature provided a sum of $25,000 for the project. County executive William Bleakley said that a new parkway should be built, but not so close to the Saw Mill River and Bronx River parkways. He argued instead for the use of New York Central Railroad's right-of-way, or a parkway on the Hudson River. There were also fears a new parkway would siphon off toll-paying drivers who previously used the Cross County Parkway and its new Fleetwood Viaduct. Nor would it help the county's largest bottleneck, the Hawthorne Circle. The county's Board of Supervisors, however, disagreed with the executive. In April 1941, county officials admitted that it was likely that the $7 million appropriated would not be enough, and instead it would be better spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8 million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford. = Revival = In March 1949, the State Council of Parks, led by Robert Moses, recommended the development of a new state park in the Sprain Valley. This new state park, which would also have a parkway built through it, would intend to take traffic off the congested Bronx River Parkway. This new parkway would be one of the construction projects involved, which included rebuilding the Bronx River and the development of Ridge Road Park. The Moses-led committee also suggested that $25,000 be appropriated for a study, survey and report on the new parkway and possible expansion of the Ridge Road Park. The city of Yonkers also became involved in the proposal because a section of land needed between NY 100 (Central Park Avenue) and Palmer Road was deeded over to the state by Westchester County for the new $13 million (1949 USD) parkway. Residents in Yonkers protested that this December 1949 transfer would require the demolition or defacing of $1 million worth of homes in the city. In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville opposed the construction, claiming that there would be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue of what to do with truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission. = \\"Route A\\" = In February 1951, Westchester County started getting ready to approve the new parkway plans from the State of New York. The new $16-18 million (1950 USD) parkway still had a short section still in question, with various groups preferring two different alignments. The State Council of Parks wanted to use the alignment used by the Odell Parkway, which still would require demolition of thirty homes in the Cedar Knolls section of Yonkers, while other groups wanted the parkway to be aligned through Crestwood, which would cost 100 homes. Five different sites were proposed at the meeting with the Westchester County Board of Supervisors on February 15. However, an agreement could not be reached by the committee and it was delayed to the next week. On February 19, the county board gave approval to the state plans, at a vote of 32 to 9. The letters of discontent amounted to fifty-nine letters or telegrams. Chairman Jefferson Armstrong spoke that the new parkway would lead to the \\"planning for the destruction of Westchester.\\" He stated that the county was giving away $8 million in taxpayer funds to the state with a debt of $2.3 million after collecting tolls on the Saw Mill River and Hutchinson River parkways. Residents of the town of Greenburgh protested the county's decision to give the undeveloped Rochambeau Park for development into a state park. In July 1951, the county of Westchester approved \\"Route A\\", one of the proposed alignments for the Sprain Brook through the city of Yonkers. Costing $10.512 million (1951 USD), the route was approved by the state and the fact that the county still owned the right-of-way would determine whether the county would give it to the state. This section of parkway as part of Route A began at the Bronx River Parkway, extending to a point just north of Jackson Avenue. A hearing was held on June 18 that mentioned that only \\"Route F-1\\", which would cost $14.579 million, and was longer would be the only other acceptable proposal. People living along the \\"Route A\\" track preferred \\"Route F-1\\", which would take fifty-four homes, over the thirty from the accepted proposal. During the meeting of the Westchester County Board of Supervisors on August 6, two officials from Yonkers attempted to filibuster the meeting to avoid the transfer of the Sprain Brook right-of-way, along with the \\"Route A\\" proposal, to the state. This filibuster failed, as the board voted 39 to 2 to transfer the right-of- way. The Taconic State Parkway Commission, Westchester County Park Commission, and the Westchester County Planning Commission all endorsed \\"Route A\\" over \\"Route F-1\\". However, the Ridge Road picnic area in Greenburgh was not given to the state. Remaining opposition stated that the route would cut $517,000 from tax revenue, and damage now $3 million worth of homes in the \\"Route A\\" section, which included the house of Jefferson Armstrong. = Construction = In December 1953, the county executive for Westchester County, Herbert Gerlach, proposed that the now $22 million (1953 USD) parkway should be constructed with tolls to help pay for the new roadway. At this time, the southern of the Bronx River Parkway was being reconstructed for use in the new Sprain Brook Parkway, with funds received before the Korean War. Jefferson Armstrong declared the new plan as a scheme by Robert Moses to \\"spend beyond his pocketbook\\" and that Gerlach was \\"intolerant\\" for proposing this just before the start of the holiday season. At the same time, the proposal was made that the county could gain funds by re-appropriating usage of Westchester County Airport, which would cost the county $11 million a year, but would only gain the county $26,000 in revenue. The Sprain Brook Parkway southbound north of Tuckahoe Road in North Yonkers. That interchange served as the northern terminus of the parkway from 1961-1963 On September 30, 1958, the State Department of Public Works notified Westchester County that it would begin construction of the Sprain Brook Parkway. Bids on the new parkway through Yonkers, with of six-lane divided parkway plus of access roads to the new roadway, would be opened on October 30, estimating the cost at $11.116 million. Slated to open in August 1961, this first leg of the Sprain Brook Parkway would connect from the Bronx River Parkway near Bronxville to north of Tuckahoe Road in North Yonkers. At that point in North Yonkers, it would meet with a connector to the New York State Thruway, which could open doors to getting tolls on the new roadway. Overpasses would be constructed at Midland Avenue, DeWitt Avenue, Central Avenue, Tuckahoe Road, Palmer Road, Kimball Avenue and the Bronx River Parkway, with an exit at Central Avenue, along with overpasses over the Sprain Brook, Sunny Brook and Grassy Sprain Brook. The section of the Sprain Brook Parkway between Tuckahoe Road and Jackson Avenue in the town of Greenburgh was slated to cost $4.103 million (1961 USD), a stretch of with of access roads. This new portion would have six lanes, with three on each side of the Grassy Sprain Reservoir, which would split the parkway in each direction. Bids were expected to be opened on November 16, 1961 for the extension of the new parkway, maintained by the East Hudson Parkway Authority. The new stretch of parkway was constructed throughout 1962 and 1963, with the East Hudson Parkway Authority announcing the opening of the extension on December 23, 1963 at a cost of $3.6 million (1963 USD). The new interchange with Jackson Avenue would also serve Sprain Ridge Park, which was also being opened at the same time as the new parkway. The Sprain Brook Parkway southbound at the Cross Westchester Expressway in Elmsford, which served as the northern end of the parkway from 1971 to 1980 The long section of the Sprain Brook Parkway was opened on November 27, 1969 from Jackson Avenue in Greenburgh to the Cross Westchester Expressway in Elmsford. This new section of Sprain Brook Parkway cost $15.4 million, extending the parkway to a length of from the Bronx to Elmsford. This also included an interchange with NY-100B in Greenburgh. An additional exit was planned at Ardsley Road to provide access to Scarsdale, Ardsley, and Dobbs Ferry, but was never built. Then-Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller also noted that the extension of the parkway north from the Cross Westchester to the Hawthorne Traffic Circle was still in final design and would begin construction in 1971 with completion of a new interchange in Hawthorne. = Completion = The delay of the final long portion of the Sprain Brook from the Cross Westchester Expressway and the Taconic State Parkway near Hawthorne Circle spent multiple years without progress until demands were placed upon Governor Hugh Carey to get state funds attached to the project. The project had been delayed multiple times and local lobbying interests including Union Carbide threatened to back out of opening corporate locations in the area of the new extension, which in 1976 was slated to cost $20 million (1976 USD). The East Hudson Parkway Authority (EHPA) originally proposed raising the tolls on the Saw Mill River and Hutchinson River parkways and building new tolls on the Hutchinson, along with the Bronx River and Taconic parkways. However, NYSDOT reported during a meeting in Albany that contracts on the new extension would be given in 1978. However, the EHPA also wanted more monetary funds for the maintenance of the parkway system in Westchester and wanted to raise the tolls to help pay for that cost. Along the state funding from Albany, the rest of the money for the Sprain Brook extension was to be paid for through federal funds. The new parkway extension, which had a slated completion in December 1980, was bid on in 1978 and won by Yonkers Contracting Company for a total of $22.8 million (1978 USD). Various materials in the extension included of gravel, of concrete, of asphalt and of steel. While the project started under the eyes of NYSDOT and EPHA, when the new parkway was complete, the East Hudson Parkway Authority had been disestablished in 1979 and control of the Sprain Brook had been turned back to NYSDOT. The new parkway would lower traffic on NY 9A through Elmsford while also connecting to the Westchester County Medical Center, a local jail, and Westchester Community College. Economic improvements of the parkway extension would include nearly 6,000 new jobs and over $2 million (1978 USD) in tax rebates. The fourth and final section of the Sprain Brook Parkway was opened on October 28, 1980 at the cost of $25 million (1980 USD). The last section, deemed a long missing link, finished the parkway to its full length between the Bronx River Parkway and the traffic circle in Hawthorne. This new piece of the parkway was built with 70% of the required funds provided by the federal government, and was designed to redistribute traffic along different parkways, with NYSDOT estimating about 44,000 cars daily using the completed roadway. The effects of the completion of the parkway were nearly immediate. Traffic on the Saw Mill River Parkway lessened with the new parkway, along with a 20% reduction on the Taconic State Parkway. However, while the route south of the Sprain Brook was seeing less traffic, the portion north of Hawthorne to Campfire Road, a section, was seeing much more traffic with the new parkway. Proposals for solving this problem included a $50 million (1982 USD) proposal to widen the Taconic State Parkway to six lanes. NY 9A south of Hawthorne also saw a considerable reduction in traffic and an improvement in the corridor north of NY 100C, becoming more of a commercial center. New industrial parks and office parks were being constructed within a couple years of completion of the new parkway along NY 9A.

It is also known as the white-dotted prominent and the tawny prominent. The species was first described by James Edward Smith in 1797. This common moth is found across North America from the northern boreal forests to as far south as Florida. It is most common in deciduous forests at some elevation. It is nocturnal but attracted to lights. The moths start to fly soon after dusk and return to resting places some time before dawn breaks (Fullard & Napoleone 2001). The adults live through late spring and early summer, and larvae are active until fall. They then pupate until the following spring. The moth is tan or dull orange, with two small silver spots on each forewing. The wingspan is approximately 2 inches (5 cm). It sports a pointed thoracic tuft between its wings. Life cycle =Larva= The larva is blue green, turning bright green as it approaches pupation age. It has a large head capsule, yellow mandibles, and yellow longitudinal stripes down its body. It feeds on the leaves of oaks and other deciduous trees (see list below). The larva is sometimes called the green oak caterpillar.

It is serialized in the Japanese magazine Monthly Comic Zero Sum by Ichijinsha and collected in thirteen tank≈çbon as of July 2017. K≈çga plans to end the manga at fifteen volumes. A 12-episode anime television series adaptation was made by J.C. Staff, broadcast in a post-midnight slot on TV Asahi and ABC from April 2005 to June 2005. The anime series was licensed and released in the US by Media Blasters in a set of 3 DVDs in early 2006. The most immediately noticeable aspect of the story is that many characters are kemonomimi‚Äîcat-like features (in this case, ears and tails) are universal from birth, so there are as many catboys, including the protagonist, as there are catgirls. People in the Loveless universe lose their animal features when they lose their virginity. Those who no longer have animal features are differentiated by society as \\"adults\\". Plot In his first day at his new school, a then twelve-year-old Ritsuka Aoyagi meets a mysterious twenty-year-old male named Soubi Agatsuma. Soubi claims to be a good friend of Ritsuka's brother, Seimei, who was murdered 2 years earlier. Upon the inspection of Seimei's abandoned computer files, Ritsuka discovers that an organization called was responsible for Seimei's death. As Ritsuka quickly discovers, Seimei and Soubi acted as a pair involved in spell battles invoked by carefully selected words. Now Soubi is Ritsuka's 'sentouki', or Fighter Unit, and Ritsuka is his 'Sacrifice'. Together, they challenge Septimal Moon to find out the truth behind Seimei's murder and the reason for Ritsuka's amnesia, and form an intimate bond as they unravel the mystery. Characters =Main characters= Ritsuka Aoyagi as he appears in the manga ; : :Ritsuka is twelve years old and the protagonist of the story. He was named after the lunar day \\"Rikka,\\" which fell on May 5 in the year 2005. His \\"true name\\" is Loveless, although it is yet to be seen on his body as the other teams' names are. He enjoys taking photographs and \\"making memories.\\" :In the first volume, the story alludes to an abrupt change of personality occurring in Ritsuka two years prior. It is seen often through flashbacks, when his mother beats him and denies that he is truly Ritsuka and that he is actually someone else in his body. Before this change, he was a popular, yet academically average student; he doesn't get along with his classmates, and he purposely points out their faults. In contrast to this, he is the perfect student. In addition to the personality change, he suffers a loss in memory. The cause of these drastic changes is still unknown, although he has regular therapy sessions to determine why. :On his first day at his new school, Ritsuka meets Soubi Agatsuma. Soubi confuses him with his sudden intimacy and puzzling claims that he was Seimei's friend and Fighter Unit. As Ritsuka discovers, Seimei's impromptu will dictates that Soubi shall \\"become Ritsuka's\\" upon his death. :Ritsuka and Soubi's relationship is complex, but in many ways Ritsuka admires Soubi. However, Ritsuka has trouble trusting others, and Soubi's various secrets continue to have an adverse effect on this. :Despite his young age and inexperience, Ritsuka is very intelligent and approaches things with startling maturity. The circumstances of his life encourage his lack of innocence; however, there have been notable incidents that bare his na√Øvet√©, particularly in sexual love and healthy relationships. Despite this, he still has firm opinions and unrelenting ideas about those subjects. It is these opinions that clash dramatically with adults and authority figures around him, most notably Soubi. Ritsuka is a pacifist, and strongly opposes violence under any circumstance. :Love is an uncomfortable subject for Ritsuka. He is wary of compliments, and doesn't like affection. Ritsuka's inner conflict over believing Soubi's declarations of love becomes a source of great tension and bitterness in their relationship. Soubi Agatsuma as he appears in the manga ; : :Soubi is a twenty-year-old student, studying Japanese art. He is a former student of Shichisei Gakuen (\\"Seven Moons Academy\\"), a school for fighters, where Ritsu Minami was his teacher. He arrived at the school and became Ritsu's student after the death of his brother, who was Ritsu's former partner. Ritsu raised Soubi and, incidentally, was the person that took his ears. Whether it was a consensual act or not wasn't specified. It is hinted by another teacher at the school that Ritsu took Soubi's virginity because Soubi had his mother's face, which made Ritsu desire him. Ritsu explains to Soubi that he took his ears to make him a better fighter. :Soubi is later partnered with Seimei. He doesn't enjoy this, feeling attached to Ritsu and resenting that Seimei is younger than he is. Seimei notices this and mocks Soubi for feeling attached to Ritsu. He later carved the name 'Beloved' into Soubi's neck, making him his fighter unit. :As ordered, Soubi contacted Ritsuka after Seimei's death. He introduced Ritsuka to the world of fighters and sacrifices and told Ritsuka he would be his Fighter Unit. He fought beside Seimei for some time, and many people believe that he is Beloved's Fighter Unit. The appearance of Nisei in the manga, however, proves this to be false later in the manga. Soubi now fights for Ritsuka as Loveless, which is considered taboo because there is not a fighter- sacrifice bond between them. There is also a severe loss of strength, and in Soubi's case, his markings bleed in battle. Soubi was revealed to not have a true name at all‚Äîin fact, Ritsu comments that he is a blank slate, and whatever marking he is given becomes his name. Since Seimei carved Beloved into his skin, it became his name. When given a command to break the windows, courtesy of Seimei, in volume 8, it is shown that he cannot disobey, no matter how strongly he is against it. :Soubi appears to know much more about Seimei and his cause of death than he will divulge. Despite Ritsuka's insistence that he tell him everything he knows, Soubi refuses. In volume 5 of the manga, he even says, \\"Seimei is my God.\\" He openly declares that he lives his life by Seimei's orders, but still says he'll obey Ritsuka's every order, which is not necessarily true. Because Seimei told Soubi not to tell Ritsuka about the seven moons he cannot tell him. =Minor characters= ; : :Yuiko is Ritsuka's classmate. Despite her ditzy, bubbly exterior, she is sharp and goodhearted. Ritsuka at first thought her annoying. On Ritsuka's first day in school, she immediately is overcome with awe and a fascination for him, and has feelings for him. At the prodding of her mean-spirited classmates, she befriends him, although he is very reluctant to accept her because he thinks she is weird and unintelligent. As Ritsuka overcomes his initial impressions of her, they become good friends. :Yuiko and Ritsuka's friendship greatly irritates their classmate, Yayoi. He had been recently rejected by Yuiko, although rather sorrowfully, claiming she will only date boys taller than her. Much to Yuiko's dismay, Ritsuka insists their friendship is platonic and it, indeed, remains that way. However, in two separate confessions to Hitomi Shinonome, Yuiko professes her love and devotion to Ritsuka. Ritsuka seems to trust Yuiko, despite his own issues with that kind of bond. :As the series progresses, a rather unusual, yet harmonious, friendship is struck between Yuiko and Soubi. Although it seems their personalities would clash, they have a unique understanding of each other. :Yuiko is characterized by her large breasts and considerable height. At 168 cm tall, Yuiko is much taller than Ritsuka and her other classmates and is often mistaken for being older than she actually is. Kio Kaidou as he appears in the manga ; : :He is a good friend and current classmate of Soubi's. They are both art students. They study the Japanese art of flowers. He describes himself as Soubi's only friend. Most of his early dialogue is filled with flirtations and passes at Soubi, despite being gently ignored or indirectly rejected each time. :Despite his early presence as a character who exists solely to create a lighter atmosphere among a very dark story, he gradually gains depth as the story progresses. He becomes a loud voice that champions pacifism and self-worth. This contrasts strongly against Soubi's submissive nature that willingly accepts violent treatment and strongly desires to be completely controlled, albeit from only very certain people. More significantly, Kio's views are shared by Ritsuka. Together, they provide a very black-and-white atmosphere that allows only one line of thinking. :It was recently revealed that Soubi only became interested in Kio because of a tattoo on his back, and a vow that he took when he got it. :He has a daughter that looks to be around ten years old; she notably has no cat ears. A twin sister also appeared but he had no knowledge of her. ; : :She is Ritsuka, Yuiko and Yayoi's teacher. She is very naive and innocent, and painfully aware of these characteristics. At twenty-three years old, she is teased and ridiculed for retaining her ears (and therefore her virginity) to such an age. She is visibly embarrassed, but as the story progresses, she gains confidence and pride over making her own choices. :Hitomi is greatly troubled by Ritsuka's mother and the injuries he sustains from her, and greatly desires to involve herself in the situation to make a change, despite her fears and her colleagues' dissent. :Her very caring and naive nature clashes spectacularly when confronted with Soubi. He brusquely rejects her and says he doesn't care for older women, although she has never made a romantic move towards him and is no more than three years older than he is. Despite his cold treatment, Hitomi seems to have had some feelings for Soubi. His brash actions are mysterious‚Äîthe only discernible reason being a general hatred towards teachers as a result of his experiences with Ritsu Minami. :Although he has rejected her, it can be noted that Soubi enjoys tormenting her to some degree. :This kind of behavior towards Hitomi may have stemmed from jealousy. Soubi refers to Hitomi as 'childish', despite her being three years older than he is. Yet he still respectfully calls her \\"Shinonome-sensei.\\" The only way he degrades her is by her sexuality, possibly because Hitomi has remained a virgin while he lost his ‚Äòears‚Äô at a much earlier age. In comparison with his extreme dislike of his own teacher figure, Ritsu, Soubi still manages to treat Hitomi as a subordinate, constantly belittling her. ; : :She is the mother of Seimei and Ritsuka. She has an important influence over her sons. Being emotionally and mentally weak, Misaki has very little grip on reality, and often hallucinates, particularly after certain events in volume 5. She is abusive and violent and blames Ritsuka's personality change for the reason Seimei \\"left\\", demanding that she wants her former Ritsuka back when she beats him. To many, she is seen as a monster, but in volume 5, she has inner dialogues of her own, allowing the reader to witness a more human, fragile side to her behavior which she cannot control. ; : :Yayoi is another classmate of Ritsuka's. He is shown as being socially awkward and with low self-esteem, and feels great jealousy towards Ritsuka. Yayoi admits that he loves Yuiko, but when he confessed to her, he was rejected for being too short. Yuiko claims that she only dates boys taller than her, but the truthfulness of that statement is called into question when it is painfully obvious she loves Ritsuka, who is barely taller than Yayoi. :Despite his jealousy of Ritsuka's close friendship with Yuiko, he is encouraged by Ritsuka's adamant claims that their relationship is purely platonic. He makes a firm statement he will not give up on Yuiko, and spends more time with her than ever. :It is notable that in the manga, Yayoi has a rather small role. He is absent for large parts of the story, and has only a small amount of dialogue. In the anime, they utilized his character much more to enhance the would-be Yayoi-Yuiko-Ritsuka love triangle, and to inject comic relief into a dark story. ; : :She is an easily angered woman who conducts experiments and creates humans who cannot feel physical pain. Although Nagisa is very young in appearance, it is later revealed that Nagisa is over 30 years old.Loveless manga; chapter 63. Her background, and affiliation are unknown. She had a sister, but what has become of her has not yet been confirmed. She created Youji after the image of her younger sister, perhaps in remembrance or to ease the pain in her heart, but exact reasons are still unknown. Her over-the-top behavior and strange lifestyle leaves her alone and alienated. She befriends Nana, and shamefully confesses that she is her only friend. :Her relationship with Ritsu is an intriguing one. She puts up a front of hating him deeply, and wishing for nothing more than to see him fail. However, there are small moments that reveal possibly more intimate feelings, as she blushes deeply whenever he is near her or touches her, though she steadfastly denies caring for him. Starting in volume 3 and finishing in volume 4, she makes a bet with Ritsu that her older Zero pair, Yamato and Kouya, can beat Ritsuka's Soubi. Ultimately, Yamato and Kouya are defeated, and Nagisa's sibling rivalry-like attitude towards Ritsu continues. Also when Seimei gouges out Ritsu's eyes she goes crazy, showing more than she probably intended of her true feelings for him, but still denies it when her Zeros make fun of her over it. ; : :He is the fighter of the male Zero pair. He is one of Nagisa's experiments, and presumably the second generation of Zeros. He first makes an appearance in volume 2, when he and Youji corner Soubi when he's alone. When Soubi wins the battle, Natsuo tells him that he and Youji have no place to return to if they lose a battle. Soubi offers to let them live at his apartment, and Natsuo warily accepts. Natsuo seems to care for Soubi and Ritsuka, and in turn, does nothing to harm them. :In one of the Zero-sum chapters, they are told to defeat Seimei. But because of the other's unusual power with words, the Zero team was rendered practically useless. In the past Natsuo pulled his own eye out but he felt nothing, because the Zero pair feels no pain. ; : :He is the sacrifice of the male Zero pair. He is the more cruel and brutal of the two; however, they are both rather blunt and cold towards others. Like Natsuo, Youji seems to care for Soubi and Ritsuka, and in turn, does nothing to harm them. :Nagisa is unashamedly biased towards Youji, often ignoring Natsuo. According to Youji, this is because he bears a significant resemblance to Nagisa's younger sister. :In one of the Zero-sum chapters, they are told to defeat Seimei. But because of the other's unusual power with words, the Zero team was rendered practically useless. ; : :She is the fighter of the female Zero pair. Until they met, both pairs believed they were the only Zero pair to exist. Both teams are experiments created by Nagisa at different times, and the female pair is presumably the first generation. Despite their unusual background, both Kouya and Yamato attend high school, although different ones. :In an interesting demonstration of the series' fictional world's rules and expectations of society, Kouya wears fake cat ears despite not being a virgin. Yamato often teases her about it, particularly because Yamato doesn't try to hide her status. They lost their \\"ears\\" to each other. Shortly, after they first met, Kouya slit her wrists just to \\"know how it would feel\\", since Zeroes can't feel pain. ; : :She is the sacrifice of the female Zero pair. In contrast to Kouya's solemness, Yamato has an outgoing, vivacious personality. Their relationship is the focus of a mini-arc in volume 4. :The relationship Yamato has with Kouya is a passionate and dedicated one that becomes unexpectedly stressful for Yamato in volume 4. Her marking, which she interprets as physical proof of her relationship with Kouya, slowly fades without warning. In a blatant reference to the homosexual nature of their relationship, both girls' markings‚Äîa 0 with a line through the middle‚Äîare on the same place: their breast. She once invites Ritsuka to a coffee shop, and reminisces the first time she and Kouya met. When she saw what Kouya did to her wrists, she got the cutter and slit her wrists too, in which point Kouya apprehends her. She replies that whatever injury Kouya has, it will also appear on her. She holds her wounded hand to her heart, and says \\"it's beginning to hurt, here.\\" In the coffee shop, Ritsuka accidentally spilled some coffee on her blouse, a result of being surprised when she said she's going to show him her mark (her breast). She goes in the bathroom claiming it is in order to remove the stain since it's going to spread. Inside, she opens her blouse and stares at her mark, which is beginning to fade, meaning it won't be long before she is not going to be Kouya's sacrifice anymore. :During their fight with Loveless and Soubi, her mark has completely disappeared, so she had to endure all of Soubi's attack. Kouya doesn't know so she proceeds fighting. However, when Yamato is brought on her knees by the pain, Kouya begins suspecting, in which Yamato vehemently refuses and says \\"it doesn't hurt!\\" Kouya forcibly opens Yamato's blouse, and sees that the zero mark has completely disappeared. She withdraws from the fight, even if it means certain outcomes. They decide to die together and be reborn than to live separately. ; : :He is Soubi's former teacher, and held a very influential role in Soubi's life when he was still his teacher. The extent of their master/slave relationship is left unknown, but it is clear that Ritsu misses those days. In the few times they have made contact within the current timeline, Soubi acts very brusque and treats him with disgust. It is also revealed that he was the one who took away Soubi's virginity. Ritsu is said to have been the Sacrifice to Soubi's mother, which led to him and Soubi meeting. :In one of the Zero-sum chapters Ritsu has his eyes gouged out by Seimei, so he could write a message to Ritsuka on the wall in the man's blood. :In the latest chapter of Zero-Sum Monthly Comic (March 2008), the seven members of Septimal Moon were revealed. Included as members were Ritsu Minami, Nagisa Sagan, and Nana. Both Ritsu and Nagisa had previously denied any affiliation with the Septimal Moon. :Ritsu is the only blind character in the series. =Manga characters= ; : :He is Ritsuka's older brother. Born on November 14, his name comes from the lunar day \\"Seimei\\", which falls around April 4. He was seventeen when he was found murdered in Ritsuka's classroom, although he died under mysterious circumstances and could only be identified by his dental records. We later learn that Seimei had faked his death, but who the person was that died in his place has not yet been revealed. He is also the sacrifice of the Beloved pair. Soubi was given to Seimei (mostly at Seimei's request) as a fighter when Seimei was only fourteen years old. :When Ritsuka lost his memory, Seimei stepped in and became an extremely important figure in his life. He protected Ritsuka from their abusive mother, Misaki, and was a great source of comfort and trust. As a result, Ritsuka was hit hardest of all by the news of his brother's death. Ritsuka is very bitter and vengeful towards those who may have been involved in the murder of his brother. :His personality is subject of great debate, and many readers have very different interpretations of his actions. To make things more confusing, the characters in the story themselves clash with their different beliefs and experiences. Ritsuka claims Seimei was a kind, gentle, loving person that always protected him. Soubi, on the other hand, is almost afraid and spiteful of Seimei. He tells Youji he would have to wait a hundred years before Seimei would speak to him. Ritsuka believes Seimei protected him from his abusive mother, Misaki. Others, such as Nagisa and 7, think he was cruel, merciless, and hateful. They claim Seimei acted strangely and would be close to no one, and go so far as refusing to eat in the presence of anyone else. Soubi's friend Kio bitterly resents Seimei for the apparently abusive manner in which he treated Soubi, but Soubi refuses to back up Kio's accusations. Ritsuka denies all of this; however, he has some startling flashbacks that show a more disturbed, obsessive side of Seimei, and even sometimes borderline incestuous behavior towards Ritsuka. Seimei has said in Volume 7 that in his world, he and Ritsuka are the only two humans that exist and everyone else to him is an animal. He later states in volume 8 that Ritsuka is the only human alive that is exactly like him. When he meets Ritsuka again he asks Ritsuka if Ritsuka would still love him. He states that if Ritsuka loves him so much that Ritsuka would be able to give his whole being to him, his body, soul, love, and mind. :However, it has recently been rumored that Seimei does indeed have a violent personality, or destructive behavior at the very least. In volume eight, Seimei stabs the wary Ritsu in the eyes after the two have a short yet heated conversation about Soubi; the wounds leave Ritsu blind. Seimei then proceeded to write the haunting message \\"Ritsuka I'm Back,\\" on the wall in Ritsu's blood for his brother, Ritsuka, to later see. However, he does seem to care about Ritsuka.There are also suggestions in canon that Seimei possesses powers beyond that of a normal sacrifice. He has been described as inhuman by Soubi and others. ; :He first appeared in the manga in volume 5. Although his character is largely a mystery, he appears to be very devious. He is the real Fighter Unit of Beloved. :He helps keep track of Ritsuka by spying on him and reports the information back to a mysterious boss. He and Soubi meet in volume 6 and from then on, Nisei stops spying on Ritsuka, but his presence is still near. :His role in volume 5 was a pivotal one: he was first introduced as \\"Seimei,\\" although he was only masquerading as Seimei to gain the trust of Misaki. It is unknown if it was carried out by Seimei's orders, but Nisei ended up drugging Misaki and trying in vain to convince her to murder Ritsuka, on the promise that Seimei would come back for good. Due to his smug demeanor and malicious behaviour towards Ritsuka, Nisei and Soubi have great animosity between each other. In volume 6, Soubi expresses his deep desire to murder Nisei at any cost. Volume 8 shows that he was captured by security at the Seven Voices Academy, but despite his struggles to respond to Seimei's calling, it appears that he was successfully restrained. :There is a strong belief among fans that Nisei is a Sociopath, judging by his actions and the way he says he can't experience feelings such as love or desire. ; : :She first appeared in volume 3 of the manga and Episode 12 in the anime. The strange coded message that Ritsuka receives from SLEEPLESS is from her. Ritsuka meets her in a special area of an MMORPG called Wisdom Resurrection several times to discuss Septimal Moon and Seimei. Her mission as stated in volume 5 is to determine whether Seimei really faked his death. She is a member of Septimal Moon, although her role in the organization (outside of the previously described mission) is unclear. She has tell-tale signs of a hikikomori, leaving her computer rarely and has even admitted to Nagisa she has no other friends. ; :A young man who still retains his ears and who first appears in volume 6. Little is known about Nakahira, although he seems protective and respectful of Chaco. His distrust and annoyance of Seimei is both shown and spoken. Nakahira owns a cat, named , meaning white-black, who gives birth to four kittens. When told by Seimei that the cat would eat her young before allowing someone to take them away, Nakahira is plainly disgusted. Seimei usually refers to him as \\"Nakahira-san\\". ; :Ritsuka's friend from his previous school. Her only appearance is in a side story in volume 4. She allows only Ritsuka to call her Osamu, but after a while lets Yuiko use it too. At first, Yuiko sees her as a love rival, but gradually they become friends and Osamu even shares her photos of Ritsuka with Yuiko. Themes Loveless focuses on \\"the power of words in creating our reality, the meaning of memory, the strength of family, and the loss of innocence\\". Media =Manga= Written and illustrated by Yun K≈çga, Loveless appears as a serial in Japanese magazine Monthly Comic Zero Sum, where it has been serialized since May 2002. The chapters are collected into tank≈çbon and published by Ichijinsha. Thirteen tank≈çbon have been released so far, with the first being published on July 1, 2002, and the thirteenth released on July 25, 2017. Tokyopop licensed Loveless for an English-language release in North America. The first volume was published on February 7, 2006, and the eighth was released on September 1, 2008; Tokyopop then went out of business. In October 2011, Viz Media announced that they had acquired the license and would continue publishing the series from volume 9. Volume 13 is available for pre-orders online and is set for a June 12, 2018, release. The series is also licensed in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment, in France by Soleil Manga, in Germany by Egmont Manga & Anime, in Italy by J-POP, in Russia by Comics Factory, and in Brazil by NewPOP. =Volume list= =Light novel= A light novel Loveless ‚Äì Ephemeral Bonds written by Natsui Aya and illustrated by Yun K≈çga. It was published last July in Iris magazine, published by Ichijinsha, the original Loveless publisher. =Anime= A 12-episode anime adaptation was made by J.C.Staff, and first aired in Japan from April 2005 to June 2005. The episodes covered approximately volumes 1‚Äì4, due to production starting in August 2004‚Äîabout four months before volume 5 was published. Because the source material hadn't finished its serialization, and with a limit of 12 episodes, the anime adaptation has quite a few differences. The most notable is the series finale, which was written specifically for the anime and left the storyline open to the possibility of a future sequel. The opening theme music was \\"Tsuki no Curse\\" and the ending theme was \\"Michiyuki\\"; both were composed by Yuki Kajiura and arranged by Masayuki Sakamoto, and performed by Kaori Hikita. Media Blasters licensed and released an English subtitled version in early 2006. On April 26, 2011, Media Blasters re-released the series with an English dub titling it as \\"Loveless: Vocal Collection\\". The series is also licensed in German by Tokyopop. =CDs= Geneon Entertainment published multiple Loveless drama CDs.

Reception Some readers of Loveless regard the relationship between Soubi Agatsuma and Ritsuka Aoyagi as shotacon. IGN considers the relationship between Soubi and Ritsuka to be handled tastefully, despite their large age gap. Yun K≈çga stated that she doesn't \\"consider it as yaoi\\" manga, although her \\"fans do\\". Julie Rosato of Mania regards the art as beautiful, saying that she would read the story for the art alone, but fortunately the storyline is complex and dark. The Book Report's Robin Brenner liked the art, describing it as \\"breathtaking --- fluid, dark, and full of slicing edges\\". Brenner also commented that the series is \\"the kind of manga that startles a reader with just how close it treads to taboo lines without ever crossing over into true transgression.\\" T.A. Noonan describes the plot as \\"a nuanced tale of love, identity, self-discovery, and the power of language\\".

Once a ubiquitous form of mixed-use architecture in Hong Kong, such shophouses are now a rare sight. These particular shophouses were redeveloped by the Urban Renewal Authority in 2016. The architecture of Hong Kong features great emphasis on contemporary architecture, especially Modernism, Postmodernism, Functionalism, etc. Due to the lack of available land, few historical buildings remain in the urban areas of Hong Kong. Therefore, Hong Kong has become a centre for modern architecture as older buildings are cleared away to make space for newer, larger buildings. It has more buildings above 35m (or 100m) and more skyscrapers above 150m than any other city. Hong Kong's skyline is often considered to be the best in the world, with the mountains and Victoria Harbour complementing the skyscrapers. Pre-sincisation architecture Back in the day of the Nanyue kingdom, Hong Kong was already inhabited. Baiyue peoples in the area demonstrated some level of sophistication in architecture. An example is the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb. File:Model of the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb.jpgModel of Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb. File:Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb.jpgThe Han Tomb's burial chamber. Local and Lingnan architecture Prior to the British settlement of Hong Kong in 1841, architecture in Hong Kong was predominantly Cantonese. With the majority of the population being fishers at the mercy of typhoons and pirates, numerous Tin Hau temples were dedicated to their patron Goddess Mazu. Likewise farmers built fortified villages to defend themselves from bandits. After the British established the entrep√¥t of Victoria City (now Central and Western District on Hong Kong Island), the local population increased substantially, and as a result Tong Lau (tenement common in Southern China, especially Lingnan) began to appear. These were three-to-four-storey buildings, tightly packed in city blocks, and combining Southern Chinese and European architectural elements. The ground floor were typically shops, with apartments and small balconies upstairs. These buildings had stairs but no elevators, and sometimes had no toilet facility. These Tong Lau remained the mainstay of Hong Kong architecture until at least World War II; a number of these building survive to this day, albeit often in a derelict state. =Hong Kong walled villages= File:HK KamTin WingLungWai EntranceGate.JPG File:HK PingShan EntranceGate LamHauTsuen.JPG File:Kat hing wai kamtin.pngWalled villages are typically very orderly. =Pang uk= File:Tai O (8).JPGPang uk in Tai O; Pang uk were built by Tanka people due to their traditions of living above water.Â§ßÊæ≥Ê£öÂ±ã File:È¶¨ÁÅ£ - Rooms with a view (8084381914).jpgPang uk in Ma Wan. =Classical Lingnan architecture in Hong Kong= File:HK Shatin TsangTaiUk.JPGTsang Tai Uk; It is a distinctively Lingnan building, with the use of \\"wok yi uk\\" (walls protruding vertically from both ends of the roof).

Notable surviving examples include the Legislative Council Building, the Central Police Station and Murray House. One building that has since been demolished was the Hong Kong Club Building; it was built atop a smaller structure designed in Italian Renaissance Revival style in 1897. The building was the subject of a bitter heritage conservation struggle in the late 1970s, which ultimately failed to save the building. The first building in Hong Kong to be classified as the first high rise was constructed between June 1904 and December 1905. It consisted of 5 major buildings, each stacking 5 to 6 stories high. The structures were raised by the Hong Kong Land company under Catchick Paul Chater and James Johnstone Keswick.\\"Hong Kong Hongs with Long Histories and British Connections.\\" Retrieved on 3 January 2013. Most high rise buildings to be built afterwards were for business purposes; the first true skyscraper in Hong Kong was built for HongkongBank in 1935, which was also the first building in Hong Kong to have air conditioning; however this has since been replaced with the HSBC Main Building, Hong Kong of 1985. Likewise the few examples of 1930s Streamline Moderne and Bauhaus architecture in Hong Kong, such as the Central Market and the Wan Chai Market, are facing imminent demolitions despite protests from heritage conservation groups. In the residential sector, multi-story buildings did not appear until the Buildings Ordinance 1955 lifted the height limit of residential buildings. This change was necessitated by the massive influx of refugees into Hong Kong after the Communist revolution in China in 1949, and the subsequent Shek Kip Mei slum fire in 1953. Public housing estates, originally seven-storeys high with notoriously cramped conditions, public bathrooms and no kitchens, were hastily built to accommodate the homeless; meanwhile private apartments, still tightly packed into city blocks like the Tong Lau of old, had grown to over 20 stories high by the mid-1960s. The private housing estate began in 1965 with Mei Foo Sun Chuen. The first major private construction came from Swire properties in 1972 with the development of middle-class estate of Taikoo Shing. With little space wasted on statues or landmarks that consumed unnecessary real estate, Taikoo Shing's design was the new standard. =Gallery= File:Murray house beach.JPGMurray House File:Hkhighestcourt1915.jpgCourt of Final Appeal File:Main Building HKU 20100926 03.JPGMain building of University of Hong Kong File:Wanchai PoliceStation09.JPGOld Wan Chai Police Station File:HK OldBankOfChinaBuilding Queensway2.JPGOld Bank of China Building File:Hong Kong City Hall.jpgHong Kong City Hall Contemporary architecture The Hong Kong skyline in 1978 In the late 1990s, the primary demand for high-end buildings was in and around Central. The buildings of Central comprise the skyline along the coast of the Victoria Harbour, a famous tourist attraction in Hong Kong. But until Kai Tak Airport closed in 1998, strict height restrictions were in force in Kowloon so that aeroplanes could come in to land. These restrictions have now been lifted and many new skyscrapers in Kowloon have been constructed, including the International Commerce Centre at the West Kowloon reclamation, which has been the tallest building in Hong Kong since its completion in 2010. Many commercial and residential towers built in the past two decades are among the tallest in the world, including Highcliff, The Arch, and The Harbourside. Still, more towers are under construction, like One Island East. At present, Hong Kong has the world's biggest skyline with a total of 7,681 skyscrapers, placing it ahead of even New York City, despite the fact that New York is larger in area. Most of these were built in past two decades. Hong Kong's best-known building is probably I. M. Pei's Bank of China Tower. The building attracted heated controversy from the moment its design was released to the public, which continued for years after the building's completion in 1990. The building was said to cast negative feng shui energy into the heart of Hong Kong due to the building's sharp angles. One rumour even went so far as to say that the negative energy was concentrated on the Government House as a Chinese plot to foil any decisions taken there. The two white aerials on top on the building were deemed inauspicious as two sticks of incense are burned for the dead. One of the largest construction projects in Hong Kong has been the new Hong Kong International Airport on Chek Lap Kok near Lantau, which was the most extensive single civil engineering project ever undertaken. Designed by Sir Norman Foster, the huge land reclamation project is linked to the centre of Hong Kong by the Lantau Link, which features three new major bridges: the world's sixth largest suspension bridge, Tsing Ma, which was built in 1997, connecting the islands of Tsing Yi and Ma Wan; the world's longest cable-stayed bridge carrying both road and railway traffic, Kap Shui Mun, which links Ma Wan and Lantau; and the world's first major 4-span cable-stayed bridge, Ting Kau, which connects Tsing Yi and the mainland New Territories.  Recent trends  In recent years, the new architecture in Hong Kong tends to focus on providing more public green spaces that combine environmentally friendly concepts together with cultural exchanges, aiming to improve the quality of life for the city's people. Besides green space, there are also the developments of unused old spaces by turning them into cultural hubs that nurture creativities and innovations. Architects have also explored more energy-efficient design. = West Kowloon Cultural District = Located at the headland of Kowloon, the West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade is a quiet haven in the busy city. Stroll along the boardwalk and find yourself surrounded on all sides by Hong Kong's iconic waterfront scenes. The promenade includes an area for cultural exchanges, where live music is played during the weekends. A nice cycling and jogging path provide citizens an amazing harbour view while doing exercises. = PMQ = A design hub which utilises old, unused spaces to create platforms for a variety of start-ups to showcase their best innovations and products for the public to get access to. After two years of renovations, the former police married quarters in Aberdeen Street, Central, has been reborn as PMQ. Although studio spaces are small (about 450 sq ft), the hub is a great venue to foster a community. Spacious open-air corridors in front of each unit will be used for exhibitions and pop-up events; there will be a co-working space and units for overseas designers-in-residence. The PMQ's entrepreneurial focus is the best chance for young Hong Kong designers to become successful, since the hierarchical nature of most local companies stifles innovation. = Hong Kong Science Park = It is a project which set to promote high end technologies and innovation ideas exchange. The development is a key infrastructure projects that integrates with Hong Kong's advancement as a regional hub for high-tech innovation. The Hong Kong Science Park is located at Tolo Harbour and comprises three phases. Phase I site is divided into three zones: Core, Corporate and Campus. The Core Zone is centrally located and consists of communal and recreational facilities, meeting and conference rooms, exhibition halls, shops, dining areas as well as office spaces for small size companies. The Corporate Zone is located along the waterfront and is reserved for large size corporate companies who wish to operate in a building solely owned by them. The Campus Zone is situated by the Tolo Highway and is designed to accommodate medium size companies in multi-tenants buildings.

Changeover times can last from a few minutes to as much as several weeks in the case of automobile manufacturers retooling for new models. Reducing changeover times became a popular way to reduce waste in Lean manufacturing after Taiichi Ohno and Shingo Shigeo popularized the SMED (Single Minute Die Exchange) method in the, now famous, Toyota Production System (TPS). The terms set-up and changeover are sometimes used interchangeably however this usage is incorrect. Set-up is only one component of changeover. Example: A soft drink bottler may run 16oz glass bottles one day, perform a changeover on the line and then run 20oz plastic bottles the next day.  The 3 Ups  Changeover can be divided into the 3 Ups: =Clean-up= Clean-up product, materials and components from the line. It may range from minor, if only the label of a package is being changed (for example from an English to a Spanish label) to major, requiring complete disassembly of the equipment, cleaning and sterilizing of the line components in the case of an injectable pharmaceutical product. =Set-up= Set-up is the process of actually converting the equipment. This may be achieved by adjusting the equipment to correspond to the next product or by changing non- adjustable \\"change parts\\" to accommodate the product. Typically it will be a combination of both. =Start-up= Start-up is the time spent fine tuning the equipment after it has been restarted. It is characterized by frequent stoppages, jams, quality rejects and other problems. It is generally caused by variability in the clean-up and set-up or by variability in the product or its components.

O'Donnell and German journalist Uwe Bahnsen, of the history of the F√ºhrerbunker in early 1945, as well as the last days of German dictator Adolf Hitler. The English edition was first published in 1978. Unlike other accounts O'Donnell focused considerable time on other, less- famous, residents of the bunker complex. Additionally, unlike the more academic works by historians, the book takes a journalistic approach. The book was later used as the basis for a 1981 CBS television film with the same name. Creation During World War II, O'Donnell worked in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. On July 1, 1945, he was mustered out and immediately took a position as German bureau chief for Newsweek magazine. On July 4, he arrived in Berlin with instructions to get details on Hitler's last days, as well as information on Eva Braun. Soon after arriving, he traveled to the bunker complex, which was mainly overlooked by troops (who were more interested in the Reich Chancellory). He found it guarded by two Red Army soldiers, and for the price of two packs of cigarettes, he gained access to it. He found the bunker complex a flooded, cluttered, stinking mess. Ironically (and essential, given his later work), the bunker had not, even at this late point, been systematically investigated by the Russians. Lying around for anyone to pick up were such historic items as Hitler's appointment book, Martin Bormann's personal diary, the battle log for Berlin, and segments of Joseph Goebbels' diary. Right in front of O'Donnell, a British colonel took as a \\"war souvenir\\" a blueprint for a reconstruction of Hitler's hometown Linz, in Austria. This historic document (brooded over by Hitler during his last days) ended up over the colonel's fireplace in Kent. As the new bureau chief, O'Donnell wrote about developments, such as the Russian discovery and identification (after several mistakes) of Hitler's body in mid-May of the same year. In August, he came upon a strange sight - the Russians were apparently making a documentary reconstructing Hitler's final days. Although the bunker complex fell within the Soviet Union controlled sector of Berlin, and many of the survivors were captured by the Soviets, it was the Western powers who revealed the first accurate account of Hitler's death. The British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, on November 1, held a press conference (covered by O'Donnell) where he revealed the generally accepted theory of Hitler's death. While O'Donnell agreed with Trevor-Roper's account save for some minor details (and, in The Bunker, continues to agree with it), he was unsatisfied with this account. Some reasons he gave were: * Trevor-Roper only had access to two witnesses - Erich Kempka, Hitler's chauffeur, and Else Kr√ºger, Bormann's secretary. When he wrote The Last Days of Hitler the following year, he only had access to two more witnesses - Hitler secretary Gerda Christian and Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann. * The vast majority of the major witnesses were taken prisoner by the Soviets and, without being charged with any crimes, spent the next ten years in Soviet captivity. Because the Soviets kept denying that Hitler was really dead, they refused to release their interrogation notes to the other Allies. * Accounts of the bunker centered on major figures, such as Hitler and Goebbels, while paying scant attention to more minor figures. Usually, such accounts stopped after the death of Hitler (or Goebbels). Except for people looking for Bormann (who, for many years, was thought to have survived), nobody bothered writing an account of the \\"bunker breakout\\" after Goebbels' death. In 1969, O'Donnell met Albert Speer, who had just published his memoirs (he wrote an article on Speer for Life, published in 1970). At this point, O'Donnell realized that many of the aforementioned witnesses had long since been released by the Soviets. He began to track them down. Over the next six years, O'Donnell narrowed his list of witnesses to about 50, and embarked on a project to collate their stories. He usually had these witnesses read his work to verify its authenticity. The book was the result. Witnesses While O'Donnell had 50 witnesses, some saw more than others. Below is a rough list of his main sources. He singled out these sources by eliminating individuals who never saw Hitler after April 22, 1945. * Albert Speer, the Nazi Minister of Armaments * Gerda Christian, one of Hitler's secretaries * Traudl Junge, another of Hitler's secretaries * Else Kr√ºger, Bormann's secretary * Erich Kempka, chauffeur The following observers were captured by the Soviets and held for a decade, and were thus unavailable for many of the initial accounts of Hitler's death. * Dr. Ernst-G√ºnther Schenck, physician and operator of a casualty station in the Reich Chancellery * Hans Baur, Hitler's personal pilot * Johannes Hentschel, mechanic in charge of bunker's electricity and water supply * Wilhelm Mohnke, Waffen-SS general * Otto G√ºnsche, Hitler's personal SS adjutant * Rochus Misch, the F√ºhrerbunker telephone/radio operator While most people were cooperative, a few didn't speak to O'Donnell. Johanna Wolf, another Hitler secretary, declined to talk since she was a \\"private\\" secretary. Albert Bormann, Martin Bormann's brother, also refused to cooperate because of family connections. Other people who had been close to Hitler in the final days, most notably Ambassador Walther Hewel, committed suicide after the break-out attempt. More witnesses died in Soviet captivity, such as Dr. Werner Haase, the last physician to attend Hitler, who had already been gravely ill with tuberculosis in April 1945. Timeline and overview O'Donnell established the following timeline, which corresponds with most other accounts of the bunker. * January 16, 1945. Hitler returns to Berlin and enters the bunker. * March 19. Speer visits Hitler in an attempt to stop his \\"scorched earth\\" policy. He fails, but later goes on to sabotage the programme. * April 12. American and British troops stop marching towards Berlin, allowing the Soviets free rein, much to the horror of the bunker inhabitants. Also, Franklin D. Roosevelt dies, creating a short-lived euphoria among top Nazis. * April 15. Eva Braun arrives at the bunker. * April 20. Hitler's 56th birthday. In a short, one-hour ceremony, Nazi leaders such as Hermann G√∂ring and Heinrich Himmler, gather in Berlin to celebrate, then leave immediately afterwards, never to see Hitler again. * April 22. Hitler suffers a nervous breakdown and finally admits that Germany will lose the war. He transfers most of the bunker staff to Berchtesgaden, and allows the German High Military Command (under Wilhelm Keitel and Alfred Jodl) to leave, as well. He resolves to commit suicide, although a visit from Goebbels apparently causes him to hold off on this for a few days. Magda Goebbels brings all six of her children to live in the Vorbunker. * April 23. Hitler expels G√∂ring from the Nazi Party after an apparent misunderstanding. * April 24. Speer returns to say good-bye to Hitler, Braun, and the Goebbels. * April 28. Hitler learns (via a newswire) of Himmler's attempt to betray him and negotiate a separate peace treaty with the western Allies. Hitler expels Himmler from the Nazi Party and SS, and has his SS FHQ representative, Hermann Fegelein, shot. * April 29. Hitler marries Braun shortly after midnight. He dictates his last will and testament. * April 30. In the afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun hold a farewell ceremony and commit suicide together in the F√ºhrerbunker. Their bodies are burned outside in the Reich Chancellery garden. * May 1. Magda Goebbels drugs her six children, then kills them with cyanide. Afterwards, Joseph and Magda Goebbels commit suicide together outside the bunker complex. Their bodies are inexpertly burned. * May 1‚Äì2. The breakout. The remaining members of the bunker staff escape in separate groups, each to a different fate. * May 2. Around noon, Soviet troops first enter the bunker complex, finding Johannes Hentschel the sole remaining occupant. Some of the above dates can be confusing, as Hitler kept unusual hours - he typically slept until late in the morning, went to bed around dawn, and held his military conferences around midnight or later. Methodology and controversy O'Donnell based the book on interviews. When witnesses disagreed, he evaluated them based on the \\"reliability\\" of their other statements, the agreement/disagreement with other witnesses, and with his intuition. Many critics (especially those from academic backgrounds) have taken issue with this methodology. Anticipating this, O'Donnell wrote in the prologue: O'Donnell asserted that his method - interviewing the witnesses - is superior to the methods used by academics, noting that much of the written documentation was burned or otherwise destroyed in the final days of the war. Also, written accounts do not allow the writer to \\"read\\" a person's expression. O'Donnell even noted that many of the people he interviewed, to make a point, would literally \\"act out\\" scenes, a touch not found in historical archives. Furthermore, he disputed the reliability of the interrogations of witnesses in 1945, which are used as primary sources by most historians. He argued that these interrogations, because of the recent occurrence of the bunker events, the end of the war, and worries over possible criminal charges, were about as accurate as \\"asking the shell-shocked to describe exactly the burst of artillery.\\" Moreover, many witnesses admitted that they either lied or withheld information during their 1945 interviews, mainly due to pressure from their interrogators (this was especially true of those captured by the Soviets). O'Donnell argued that the witnesses needed time to \\"digest\\" their experiences. However, many critics dispute whether this method was the most reliable. The most cited example was O'Donnell's complete acceptance of Albert Speer's claim to have tried to assassinate Hitler. While many professional historians dispute this claim due to lack of evidence, O'Donnell wrote about it unquestioningly. It is arguable that, if one compares the accounts written in The Bunker with those in Inside the Third Reich, that O'Donnell presents the supposed assassination attempt as more dramatic and purposeful. Admittedly, O'Donnell befriended Speer, and interviewed him 17 times for the book, more than any other witness. O'Donnell also used hearsay evidence. He used Dr. Schenck for this on numerous occasions, first to discuss Hitler's health (since Hitler's personal SS physician, Haase, died in Russian captivity), and to discuss Hitler's final conversation with his friend Walther Hewel (who committed suicide right in front of Schenck). O'Donnell states other theories of the bunker events, some of which are criticized because of the above methodology. To name a few: * He held that the Soviets botched the investigation into Hitler's death. As he saw firsthand, the Soviets did not properly evaluate the \\"crime scene.\\" Also, in his capacity as a Berlin journalist, he argued that either paranoia or a desire to embarrass the West led Joseph Stalin to deny Hitler's death, and with it, to deny the May 15, 1945 autopsy of Hitler's corpse, which was verified by dental records. O'Donnell holds that whatever remains of Hitler still existed by this date were cremated and scattered, and that any parts of the corpse the Soviets claimed to have afterwards were fabricated to satisfy Stalin. According to contemporary historians, such as Ian Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were thoroughly burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.Kershaw, Ian (2008). Hitler: A Biography, W. W. Norton & Company, p. 958 * He holds that Magda Goebbels was alone responsible for the deaths of her children, although someone must have given her the cyanide, and her husband was supportive of the act. He bases this on Madga's personal correspondence, as well as interviews with the survivors. Some historians do not believe Magda Goebbels was capable of those actions alone. * From his interviews, he concludes that Hitler did indeed die from shooting himself in the head while simultaneously biting into a cyanide capsule. For the ones who claim this type of suicide was near impossible, he sardonically pointed to Walther Hewel's suicide a few days after Hitler's death. Hewel killed himself in the same way, after receiving the same instructions Dr. Haase gave Hitler.O'Donnell (2001) [1978], pp. 322‚Äì323 \\"... we have a fair answer...to the version of ...Russian author Lev Bezymenski...Hitler did shoot himself and did bite into the cyanide capsule, just as Professor Haase had clearly and repeatedly instructed (Hitler and Hewel) to do. Pistol and poison, Q.E.D...\\" * He claims that nobody heard the shot that killed Hitler. Whenever he asked witnesses who were standing by the double doors to Hitler's study, which were thick enough to muffle such a sound, they claimed they heard nothing. He put forth that ones who did make this claim in 1945 withdrew it, saying that Allied interrogators pressured them into saying it. He contends that some people who claim to have heard a shot were not even present at the scene. One of the most unusual claims made by O'Donnell involve the death of Hermann Fegelein. Witnesses claimed that he was killed partly because Hitler suspected his mistress at the time was a spy. O'Donnell created a theory out of this, and makes the claim that Fegelein's mistress actually was a spy, possibly a Hungarian working for British intelligence. However, he could not uncover evidence to support his theory. Breakout O'Donnell's main contribution to F√ºhrerbunker literature was his account of the \\"breakout\\" that occurred on the night of May 1‚Äì2, 1945 - no other historian (or writer) attempted to describe this event before him. He devotes two chapters to it. The survivors divided into groups (some men, including General Hans Krebs, stayed behind to commit suicide). The groups left on the evening of May 1, each waiting a period of time after the others left. Their plan was to head underground, in the city's subway line, to emerge to the northwest, outside of the Russian-occupied zone of Berlin. The three main groups were: * Group 1, led by Wilhelm Mohnke. This group awkwardly made its way north to a German army hold-out on the Prinzenallee, and included Dr. Schenck and the female secretaries. The secretaries, upon reaching the outpost, broke off with the help of a Luftwaffe lieutenant. While Junge was later held for several months as the \\"personal prisoner\\" of a high-ranking Russian officer,The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared For Stalin From The Interrogations of Hitler's Personal Aides, New York, 2005, Gerda Christian and Else Kr√ºger, smuggled across Soviet-occupied territory by sympathetic British soldiers, eventually made it to the British/American lines; Kr√ºger, questioned extensively about her then-\\"missing\\" boss, later married one of her interrogators. Mohnke and several other men stayed and were captured by the Russians, then treated to dinner with General Vladimir Alexei Belyavski, who tried to get them drunk with vodka to get information on Hitler's death. They didn't talk, and were shipped off to Moscow. * Group 2, led by Johann Rattenhuber. This group made it to Invalidenstra√üe northwest of the bunker, but many of its members were captured by the Russians. * Group 3, led by Werner Naumann, and is most notable for including Martin Bormann. This group completely missed a turn off Friedrichstra√üe and walked right into Russian gunfire. Bormann and his companion, Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger, were almost certainly intoxicated, and apparently committed suicide with cyanide capsules after realizing the group had run into trouble (this was confirmed by the 1972 discovery of their bodies, which was verified by DNA tests in 1998). Most surviving members of this group were captured by Soviet army troops. Hans Baur, Hitler's pilot, was severely wounded and almost committed suicide. Instead, he was captured, and the Russians put him through many brutal interrogations based on speculation that he might have flown Hitler or Bormann to safety at the last minute. Misch and Hentschel remained behind in the bunker. Misch left on the morning of May 2, but was soon captured by the Russians. Hentschel stayed in the bunker, while some female Soviet army officers looted Eva Braun's room around noon before he too was taken by the Russians and flown to Moscow.

It is one of the largest providers in the sector worldwide. The group operates through its core business brands Phonak, Unitron, Hansaton, Advanced Bionics and AudioNova. On August 1, 2007 Phonak AG officially changed its name to Sonova Holding AG. Sonova Group and its brands hold 24% of the global hearing aid market in sales. History A child wearing the company's Advanced Bionics cochlear implant with custom decorative covers. The group traces its roots back to the Zurich-based AG f√ºr Elektroakustik, which was founded in 1947. Ernst Rihs acquired a majority shareholding in 1965, renaming the company Phonak AG. His two sons, Hans-Ueli and Andy Rihs, also went on to join the firm, along with Beda Diethelm; after Ernst Rihs‚Äô death, the two sons took over his shares while Beda Diethelm became a shareholder with equal rights. Phonak Holding AG was founded in 1985 as a holding company for the Phonak Group. The company was floated on the SWX Swiss Exchange[2] in 1994 and renamed Sonova Holding AG on 1 August 2007, although this change applied only to the holding company; all the subsidiaries (including Phonak AG) and product names have remained unaffected. Company Sonova mainly develops and markets hearing aids, cochlear implants, and wireless communication devices compatible with their hearing devices. As of March 2018, the Sonova Group was present in more than 90 countries and employed 14,242 staff, and had sales of CHF 2,645.9 million the previous year. The group consists of more than 30 constituent companies. Annual Report Sonova 2012/2013 Its research facilities are located in Switzerland, Canada, and the USA, with manufacturing plants in Switzerland, China and Vietnam. Distribution is handled by its in-house wholesale network and independent sales partners. The group also owns retail outlets in selected countries. In November 2009, Sonova announced the takeover of the Advanced Bionics Corporation, a company based in California which specializes in developing and manufacturing cochlear implants. Media Release 11/09/2009 The purchase was successfully completed in January 2010. Sonova Media Release 01/04/2010 In March 2015, Sonova announced the takeover of Hansaton Akustik GmbH, a Hamburg-based, family-run wholesale hearing instrument company. Media Release 03/02/2015 The purchase was successfully completed in April 2015. Sonova Media Release 04/16/2016 In May 2016, Sonova announced agreement to acquire AudioNova International B.V., one of Europe‚Äôs largest hearing aid retailers, Media Release 05/04/2016 and successfully completed the acquisition of AudioNova in September 2016. The combination of AudioNova and Sonova creates one of the broadest hearing aid retail service networks in Europe. Media Release 09/15/2016 Social engagement and sponsoring The Phonak Group sponsored the Phonak Cycling Team for seven years between 2000 and 2006, although its involvement in competition cycling and the successes it achieved were somewhat eclipsed by several doping affairs in which top riders from the Phonak Cycling Team were repeatedly implicated. On July 28, 2006, Phonak announced it was discontinuing its sponsorship activities in competition cycling. In the fall of 2006, the Group‚Äôs Phonak AG subsidiary launched the Hear the World Foundation. The Foundation‚Äôs aim is to create a world in which each person has the chance of good hearing. The Foundation became a group-wide initiative of Sonova in October 2012. Hear The World Press Release 15.10.2012 Brands Sonova operates through its following core business brands: =Phonak= Phonak manufactures a wide range of digital hearing aids and integrated wireless communication systems. After the merger of Advanced Bionics into Sonova, Phonak started developing wireless technology for Advanced Bionics cochlear implants; notably the Roger receivers that connect to cochlear implant speech processors. In 2016, Phonak launched their first rechargeable hearing aid device. =Unitron= Unitron is another hearing aid producer owned by Sonova. Unitron was founded in 1964 and currently operates within 70 countries. =Advanced Bionics= Advanced Bionics was founded in 1993 and has been a subsidiary of the Sonova Group since 2009. Advanced Bionics develops cochlear implant technology designed to help children and adults with profound hearing loss receive greater access to sound. Upon the acquisition by Sonova, Advanced Bionics started integrating Phonak technology into their speech processors, starting with the Na√≠da series. Along with sound processors, the company utilizes Phonak technology for bluetooth streaming, Easycall, and FM systems. As of 2016, Advanced Bionics' primary competitors were MED-EL and Cochlear Limited in the cochlear implant market, in which those two companies held around 70% of the market; as percent of the market share Advanced Bionics holds less than Cochlear Limited and more than MED-EL.  HiRes90k injuries  In November 2010, Advanced Bionics voluntarily recalled a batch of its HiRes 90K implants after at least two pediatric patients - Grace Bagadiong and Breanna Sadler, experienced painful malfunctions that resulted in electric shocks, convulsing, and vomiting. In Sadler v. Advanced Bionics the company was found to have been negligent and forced to pay punitive damages as well as for the medical care needed by the victim of the faulty device, but the company announced it would appeal on the grounds of the punitive damages being too high. Years before two pediatric patients had experienced such drastic device failures, the company had been repeatedly warned of problems with the HiRes90k since 2004. Over 4000 devices were recalled, of which 1000 had failed.

The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are a useful convention for depicting the inner conflict of a character.  Iconography  After Guido Reni. The shoulder angel often uses the iconography of a traditional angel, with wings, a robe, a halo, and sometimes a harp. The shoulder devil likewise usually looks like a traditional devil with reddish skin, horns, barbed tail, a pitchfork or, more precisely, a trident and in some cases, cloven hooves. Often, both resemble their host, though sometimes they will resemble other characters in the story who are responsible or mischievous. In Western culture the idea develops the Christian concept of a personal guardian angel, who was sometimes considered to be matched by a personal devil who countered the angel's efforts, especially in popular medieval dramas like the 15th century The Castle of Perseverance. In both this and Christopher Marlowe's play The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, of about 1592, the \\"Good Angel\\" and \\"Bad Angel\\" offer competing advice (Act 2, scene 1, etc.) to the hero.  Origins  The non-canonical early Christian book, The Shepherd of Hermas, of around A.D. 140‚Äì150,Earlychristianwritings.com has a reference to the idea of two angels: \\"There are two angels with a man‚Äîone of righteousness, and the other of iniquity\\".Sixth commandment, chapter 2, The Shepherd of Hermas These angels in turn descend into a person's heart, and attempt to guide a person's emotions. Hermas is told to understand both angels, but to only trust the Angel of Righteousness. The concept is similar to ideas of personal tutelary spirits that are very common in many ancient and traditional cultures. In some Christian folklore, each person has a dedicated guardian angel whose task is to follow the person and try to prevent them from coming to harm, both physical and moral. At the same time each person is assailed by devils, not usually considered as single and dedicated to a single person in the same way as the guardian angel, who try to tempt the person into sin. Both angels and devils are often regarded as having the ability to access the person's thoughts, and introduce ideas.  Similar beliefs  There is a similar Islamic belief of Kiraman Katibin, two angels residing on either shoulder of humans which record their good and bad deeds. However, these angels do not have influence over the choices one makes, and only record one's deeds. However, there is a concept much similar to the shoulder angel and devil: the qareen, which, according to Islamic literature, is a personal companion, and there are two with each individual, one from the angels and another from the jinn. The word qarƒ´n literally means 'constant companion'. The angel pushes the individual to do good and obey God while that from the jinn does the opposite. In Japanese Buddhism, the Kushoujin are a pair of beings ‚Äì Domyo, meaning \\"same name\\" and Dosho, meaning \\"same birth\\" ‚Äì which sit on a person's shoulders, observing and reporting all his deeds. Domyo records good deeds, but Dosho reports bad ones.  Modern representations  Modern cartoon In several modern fictional stories, a character can be marked as especially evil or mischievous by receiving similarly bad advice from both shoulder figures, having a second shoulder devil instead of the angel, or being persuaded by the devil to kick the angel out. One may view this image in Freudian terms, with the Angel representing the Super-ego (the source of self-censorship), counterbalanced by the Devil representing the Id (the primal, instinctive desires of the individual), which leaves the individual in question as the Ego. The Disney animated film The Emperor's New Groove, its sequel Kronk's New Groove, and the animated series The Emperor's New School feature the concept of shoulder angels and devils, most notably in the character of Kronk. His appear at various points of moral crisis in the franchise for Kronk, but often spend more time antagonizing each other than actually trying to take Kronk down one path or another. The Oscar-winning Disney short Lend a Paw also featured Pluto being influenced by a shoulder angel and devil. In Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, a Disney animated series aimed at preschoolers, Pete has similar manifestations‚Äîthough simply colored white and red rather than depicted with wings and a halo/horns and a pitchfork, respectively. The film Cloud Atlas is an example of utilizing a shoulder angel plot device in feature film, in which the character played by Hugo Weaving whispers bad and good advice to the character played by Tom Hanks. Old Georgie (Hugo Weaving) appears only in critical points of the story, where Zachry's mind (Tom Hanks) is split between right and wrong choices. BYUtv's sketch comedy series Studio C makes use of the concept in several sketches, with the physical comedy aspect of the angel or devil-a full-sized being played by an actor-having to physically climb up onto the shoulder of the one they are attempting to influence for good or evil. It is speculated that the two main protagonists of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's Good Omens are supposed to represent the angel and demon on your shoulder as the Demon Anthony J. Crowley tempts people into sin/ baser nature while his counter figure the Angel Aziraphale encourages people to do good and rise above their baser instincts, however neither forces people into following their examples allowing free will to be exercised unimpeded. In The Simpsons episode \\"Whacking Day\\", Homer presents the concept that everyone has a good and a bad self to Lisa. A fantasy sequence set in Homer's imagination then begins, showing Homer's bad self, visually depicted as Homer in a devil costume, dancing on the grave of the good Homer while singing 'I am Evil Homer, I am Evil Homer', implying that within him the battle for good and evil has long ago been won by his bad angel.  In modern media  In the Discworld novel Nightwatch by Terry Pratchett the killer Carcer was considered by the hero Samuel Vimes to have a demon on each shoulder rather than an angel and a demon, but not opposing each other, just in competition to urge Carcer on to worse deeds. It was said that if Vimes looked deep into Carcer's eyes, he could see the demons looking back. The Adventures of Tintin comics used this concept in at least two stories. In The Red Sea Sharks, Captain Haddock's good and bad angels try to convince him to drink a bottle of whisky. The bad one is able to convince him, but the bottle smashes before he is able to drink it, leaving the good angel victorious. In Tintin in Tibet, Snowy is tempted by his demon to lap up Captain Haddock's whiskey leaking from his rucksack or enjoy a huge bone rather than deliver a vital message. His good angel loses the argument, leaving in tears, and he gnaws the bone while the message blows away. Realizing his mistake, Snowy makes amends by reaching a local monastery and brings the monks to help. In both examples, the angels resemble good or bad versions of their subject, with horns and angel wings. Sluggy Freelance comics has made use of this theme, with all three of the main characters: Riff, Torg and Zoe, who have been shown debating with their shoulder angels and demons.

It is a symbol which is shaped like a plus sign depicted with anchor-like fluke protrusions at its base. There are many variations on this symbol, but the most common form connects a ring with a bar, with a cross-bar, terminating on the other end with two curved branches or arrowheads. The anchor symbolizes hope, steadfastness, calm and composure. Background This cross may also be referred to has the \\"Cross of Hope,\\" dating back to its origins in the early Christian church. The anchor cross is used to signify 'fresh start' or 'hope,' as referenced in Hebrews 6.19: \\"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.\\" An anchor brings security, which was important in the uncertain times of the early church. Use of the anchor as a symbol has also been attributed to Seleucus I, which was then adopted by the Jews living in the Seleucid Empire on their coinage. Thus the anchor as symbol would have been familiar to early Christians. Inscriptions found in the catacomb of St. Domitilla dating back to the 1st century feature the use of the anchor as a symbol. The anchor is one of the oldest symbols used in Christianity, and in this instance it is combined with the cross, representing Jesus. Clement of Alexandria is said to have approved the use of the anchor as a symbol because of its use in scripture. Hebrews 6.19 ties the anchor to the concept of \\"hope,\\" and thus Christians hope of salvation through Christ. Missionaries of the United Methodist Church wear the anchor cross as a reminder that their work should always be anchored in \\"anchored in faith, hope and love\\" in their work. The region of Camargue in France created their own symbol, made to represent the \\"\\" of herdsmen and fishermen, and the three theological virtues of Christianity. It has the same elements as an anchored cross: *a cross anchory with the three fleur-de-lis replaced by camargue tridents representing Christian faith; *an anchor representing hope; along with * the heart of The Three Marys) representing charity St. Clement's Cross The anchored cross is also referred to as the mariner's cross or St. Clement's Cross in reference to the way he was martyred ‚Äì tied to an anchor and thrown from a boat into the Black Sea. Despite his untimely end at sea, Clement is considered a patron saint of sailors, and many wear his cross for protection. In heraldry The anchored cross is also a feature in coats of arms, and flags, in which context they are referred to by the heraldic terms \\"anchry\\" or \\"ancre.\\" Examples of this are found in the hooked anchor representing Vinnytsia, Ukraine; a three- leaf cross with and anchor on the coat of arms of Pyh√§ranta, Finnland; a patriarchal cross with an anchor in the coat of arms of Barkakra Municipality, Sweden, and , Germany; the coat of arms of Le√≥n, Spain and Tallinn, Estonia; and the personal shield of , the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Aix.

In 1908, he went to study violin at the Music Academy of Lausanne. He then studied economics and musicology at the University of Munich, graduating in both in 1913. In Munich, he acquired an excellent knowledge of the German language. Back in England, he went as a volunteer into the army. His first wife, Dorothy Stallwood Adams, died in 1918. First World War intelligence work Best served as a Captain in the First World War; first as a member of the Intelligence Corps- owing partially to his poor eyesight and his command of French, German and Flemish-Historical Dictionary of British Intelligence, Nigel West, Rowman & Littlefield, 2014, p. 64 and later as the second officer of the GHQ's Wallinger London bureau. In 1917, Major Ernest Wallinger sent him to Rotterdam, Netherlands to handle and set up intelligence networks in German-occupied Belgium. The Wallinger service was linked to several Belgian resistance groups. A well-known recruit of Wallinger was the Belgian resistance heroine Gabrielle Petit. In Rotterdam, Best came into conflict with Richard Tinsley, local station chief of MI6. In November 1917, he was recalled to London after he was caught sleeping with the wife of an influential Belgian resistance leader. He was replaced by Lieutenant Ivone Kirkpatrick. Best later accused Tinsley of scheming against him.Ruis, Edwin. Spynest: British and German Espionage from Neutral Holland 1914‚Äì1918. Briscombe: The History Press, 2016, p. 193. Captain Best was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Life in the Netherlands Nieuwe Uitleg: the street in The Hague where Best had his office in 1939 After his demobilisation in 1919, Best returned to the Netherlands, where he and his partner in business and intelligence, P.N. van der Willik, set up a British firm, called the Continental Trade Service, also called Pharmisan, a trading company, mainly in pharmaceutical products, and a consultancy agency for British businessmen. In 1919 he married Margaretha van Rees, a Dutch painter. Living in a prime residential location in The Hague, he was known as a serious British businessman.Sigismund Payne Best profile, venlo-zwischenfall.de; accessed 1 December 2015. Best's cover was a thin one. Although he was married to a Dutch wife, his tall figure, spats and monocle made him, in the eyes of many Dutchmen, the embodiment of a British spy. At times he would think it safe to confide that this presumption was wholly justified. From 1938, he was a member of Haag'schen Golf Club and had good relations with the Dutch royal family. On Friday afternoons he regularly played music with his 'neighbors' Prince Hendrik, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and husband of Queen Wilhelmina. His wife, whom he called \\"May\\", was a relatively well known artist, and portrayed Queen Wilhelmina. In December 1938, he undertook with his wife May and his foster son Enzo Bonopera an extended trip to Germany, Switzerland and France. Second World War intelligence work With war looming in 1938, Best was recruited into Claude Dansey's ‚ÄòZ‚Äô organization, a new branch of the SIS. Best already knew Dansey, having served with him in the Netherlands in 1917. The Hague was an important place in the Z-network, Dansey having established the regional headquarters of his network in the two neutral countries where he had worked during the First World War: Netherlands and Switzerland. Best's operations in the Netherlands stood at the crosswinds of a political storm. He had, on the orders of London but against all trade craft, combined his NOC operations with those of Major Richard Henry Stevens, a less-experienced operative who operated from the British Embassy as the head of a notional \\"Passport Control Office\\". The PCO (which, like Section Z, operated throughout Europe) was compromised before its operations were combined with those of Section Z, and thus it was a simple matter for the Germans to mount sting and counterintelligence operations against British agents throughout Europe. A young Nazi lawyer, Walter Schellenberg, joined the SS in 1933. He met Reinhard Heydrich and went to work in the counter-intelligence department of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). From 1939 to 1942, he was Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler's personal aide and a deputy chief in the Reich Main Security Office under Heydrich who answered only to Himmler. In that capacity, he played a major role in a 1939 false flag operation against Stevens and Best. Best, Stevens and Dutch Lieutenant Dirk Klop (pretending, for neutrality's sake, to be a British national) began a series of meetings, which, despite the Britons' misgivings about Fischer and his putative friends (who were in fact SD agents), culminated in what pretended to be an agreement to form, post-Hitler, a united German-British front against the Soviet Union. The agreement included a period in which Adolf Hitler would be kept as a figurehead, then a restoration of democracy and legal protection for Jewish citizens. In London, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, having seen Hitler violate the Munich agreement by seizing Czechoslovakia, was more than ready to foment a German coup. However, Best's suspicions that their German contacts might be double agents had been passed up the intelligence chain and the operatives were warned to stay away from the German border. In Britain, the top secret talks were seen by many ‚Äî including the new First Sea Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill ‚Äî as another Munich.Koblank, Peter. Geheimakte \\"Venlo Incident\\", mythoselser.de (2009); accessed 1 December 2015. Kidnapping In any case, not only were the talks a complicated German bluff, but the entire operation was brought to an abrupt end. Himmler had decided, over Schellenberg's objections, to have the British operatives abducted; the attempt by Georg Elser to assassinate Hitler at the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller, believed by Himmler to be the result of British machinations, forced the matter. The next day, in a daring and violent abduction, Best and Stevens were kidnapped from the Caf√© Backus on the outskirts of Venlo ‚Äî Klop was fatally wounded in the shootout with German agents ‚Äî and rushed to Berlin.\\"The Venlo Kidnapping\\", The Times, 19 February 1948. Under interrogation, Best and Stevens gave up detailed information on British espionage activities. Worse, Stevens was carrying on him a plain text list of SIS agents in Europe. Imprisonment Aerial view of Dachau concentration camp. Best was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen between 1940 and 1945, and for a few months of 1945, in the Dachau concentration camp. Fluent in German and having the protection of the Gestapo, he was able to make life in Sachsenhausen as palatable as he could, collecting a good wardrobe of clothes, a library of books and a radio to keep himself informed with the progress of the war.Payne Best, Sigismund. The Venlo Incident (London: Hutchison, 1950), p. 16 During his imprisonment, he came into contact with a number of famous figures, including not only Elser, but also the famed theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, whose last message he relayed to Bonhoeffer's friend, Bishop George Bell. Bell and Bonhoeffer's efforts to interest the British government in supporting German anti-Nazi forces failed in large part because of Churchill's distaste for Chamberlain's actions and the fear of another Venlo Incident. In late April 1945, Best was on the transport to Tyrol where he was liberated by regular German troops under the Command of Wichard von Alvensleben.Peter Koblank: Die Befreiung der Sonder- und Sippenh√§ftlinge in S√ºdtirol, Online-Edition Mythos Elser 2006 Life after World War II After the war, Best ran an import-export business in The Hague dealing in Humber bicycles.Historical Dictionary of British Intelligence, Nigel West, Rowman & Littlefield, 2014, p. 64 In 1953, his marriage to May ended. After marrying his third wife, Bridget, they moved to Calne, Wiltshire, England. In 1950, with permission from Stewart Graham Menzies, head of SIS ('C'), Best published his memoirs under the title The Venlo Incident that became a bestseller. He died in 1978, aged 93, in Calne. His ashes were scattered in the Garden of Remembrance of the crematorium in Swindon.Sigismund Payne Best obituary, The Times, 27 September 1978.

He has served as the general manager (or in an equivalent role) for three teams: the Seattle SuperSonics and Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA, and the Seattle Seahawks of the NFL. Whitsitt, commonly known as \\"Trader Bob\\" for his penchant for making blockbuster deals, has met with mixed success in both leagues.  Seattle SuperSonics  He was hailed as the architect of the 1995-1996 Sonics team that went to the NBA Finals (and lost to the Chicago Bulls); several years before that Whitsitt shocked many observers by drafting Shawn Kemp, a promising player who had never played a game of college ball. At the end of the 1993‚Äì94 NBA season, he was awarded the NBA Executive of the Year Award after the SuperSonics went from 55‚Äì27 (and third in the Western Conference) the previous season to a 63-19 record and the number 1 seed in the Western Conference. However, after a falling-out with then Sonics owner Barry Ackerley, Whitsitt resigned his position with the Sonics in 1994 and took an equivalent job with the Portland Trail Blazers, owned by Paul Allen. In the eight seasons he was the general manager of the SuperSonics, the team had a total record of 377‚Äì279.  Portland Trail Blazers During the first two years of his tenure, Whitsitt oversaw an aging roster that had been to the Finals earlier in the decade, but needed serious retooling. In the 1996 off- season, Whitsitt began to make his mark with several moves. He traded for guard Isaiah Rider and forward Rasheed Wallace, and signed guard Kenny Anderson to a free agent contract. He also drafted high-school player Jermaine O'Neal in the draft. These moves made the Blazers a better team in the short run (in 1999 and 2000 the Blazers advanced to the Western Conference finals), but criminal activity of some players Whitsitt acquired began to grate on the Portland fan base; many started to refer to the team as the \\"Jail Blazers\\". Whitsitt's reputation started to turn sour after the 2000 season, when the team executed several controversial moves. Popular player Brian Grant opted out of the final three years of his contract and was traded away in exchange for Shawn Kemp; and center-forward Jermaine O'Neal was traded for Dale Davis. Both players were unhappy with their roles and asked to be traded. These moves were made to push the team \\"over the hump\\" (the Blazers went to the Western Conference finals), but they backfired spectacularly‚ÄîKemp struggled with both on and off-court issues before being waived by the Blazers prior to the 2002-03 season, while O'Neal went on to become an All-Star for the Indiana Pacers. In addition, Whitsitt further alienated the Portland fan base by acquiring Seattle forward Ruben Patterson, a convicted sex offender, via free agency. Even before the disastrous 2000 off-season, many questioned Whitsitt's evaluation of basketball talent. For one thing, Whitsitt never shied away from players with checkered pasts; this often upset fans; it was also alleged that such players‚Äîwhile talented‚Äîlacked the emotional maturity necessary to be a \\"winner\\". For another thing, Whitsitt was accused of not paying attention to team \\"chemistry\\", or how the various players might interact on the floor (or in the locker room). Whitsitt himself was famously quoted as saying that he \\"never studied chemistry in college\\". The result of this, it is claimed, are teams that make inefficient use of the talents available; or which are \\"less than the sum of their parts\\". Whitsitt has also been criticized for attempting to stock teams with \\"All-Star\\" caliber players (including for bench roles), leading to conflicts over playing time and reduced team camaraderie.https://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/25/sports/sp-42619http://a.espncdn.com/nba/news/2003/0507/1550486.html Many other players acquired by Whitsitt have had significant off-court or legal issues (either with the Blazers or elsewhere); these include: * Gary Trent (drafted in 1995) * Jermaine O'Neal (drafted in 1996) * Rasheed Wallace (acquired by trade in 1996) * Isaiah Rider (acquired by trade in 1996) * Damon Stoudamire (acquired by trade in 1998) * Bonzi Wells (drafted in 1999) * Shawn Kemp (acquired by trade in 2000) * Rod Strickland (signed as free agent in 2001) * Zach Randolph (drafted in 2001) * Ruben Patterson (signed as free agent in 2001) * Qyntel Woods (drafted in 2002) After the 2003 season, Whitsitt resigned his position with the Trail Blazers and was replaced with Steve Patterson as the team president and John Nash as the general manager. In his 9 seasons, the Trail Blazers had gone 426-280 with postseason appearances in every season and one division title, but after two straight seasons of losing in the Conference Finals they failed to get past the first round in the following three seasons as GM, with the team falling to 10th place in the conference the season after his resignation.http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Blazers-Whitsitt-part- ways-1114204.php Seattle Seahawks Several years after hiring Whitsitt to run the Trail Blazers; Paul Allen gave him a second role as president of the Seattle Seahawks in 1997. Whitsitt is a self-proclaimed \\"basketball guy\\", being more knowledgeable about basketball than about football; for this reason his role with the Seahawks was primarily involved with business management. Decisions on players were generally left to others, until after his resignation in 2003 as GM of the Trail Blazers, when he installed himself as the ultimate decision maker of personnel in the Seahawks organization. This caused much friction due to his poor decision making and basketball background making him poorly suited as an NFL GM, especially with coach Mike Holmgren over the possibility of letting Matt Hasselbeck leave the team for free agency. The powerplay is generally viewed as the catalyst that ultimately lead to his firing after the 2004 season.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2006/01/10/AR2006011001864.html While president of the Seahawks, Whitsitt oversaw three major changes to the team. First, he helped negotiate the development of CenturyLink Field, the stadium the team plays its home games in (this facility replaced the aging Kingdome). Second, Whitsitt hired Mike Holmgren (formerly of the Green Bay Packers as coach of the Seahawks (and later as general manager), and third, the team moved from the American Football Conference (where it played from 1977-2001) back to the National Football Conference (where they played in their inaugural season of 1976) in 2002. In 2004, Whitsitt was diagnosed with a growth on his colon (which was surgically removed); he made a full recovery. After the 2004-2005 season, in a move which has been widely praised by both the Portland and Seattle sports media, Whitsitt was suddenly (and unexpectedly) fired as president of the Seahawks after losing a power struggle with Holmgren; he was replaced in that position by Tim Ruskell. The move paid dividends, as the following year the Seahawks won the NFC championship, advancing to Super Bowl XL.

The title uses a rhyming slang phrase used in Britain from the 1980s (Pete Tong = \\"wrong\\"), referring to the BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong. It won two awards at the US Comedy Arts Festival for Best Feature and Best Actor (Kaye) and swept the Gen Art Film Festival awards (Grand Jury and Audience). It was filmed on location in Ibiza and shot entirely in HD. Ibiza locations used in the movie include the music venues Pacha, Amnesia, Privilege, DC10 and the historic Pike's Hotel and Cala Llonga beach. Plot Frankie Wilde is a British music producer and a DJ based in Ibiza. After years of playing in night-clubs he loses his hearing, first apparent when he hears a high-pitched whine instead of an Arsenal football match on TV. At this time, Frankie is making his next album with his \\"two Austrian mates\\" Alfonse and Horst, who seem more suited for a rock band, but his hearing degrades rapidly and progress stagnates. Frankie refuses to acknowledge his problem until a gig in Amnesia, when he cannot hear the second channel in his headphones and must crossfade one song into the next without being able to beatmatch them. When the crowd boos him, he throws the turntable and the mixer onto the dance floor, and is forcibly removed from the club. Frankie agrees to see a doctor, who tells him he has lost hearing in one ear and has 20% left in the other. He warns Frankie that unless he stops abusing drugs and listening to loud noises, he will soon be completely deaf, and even the use of his hearing aid would only further degrade his hearing. During a recording session, Frankie confesses the full nature of his hearing loss to Alfonse. He inserts his hearing aid to demonstrate and, overwhelmed by the sudden sound exposure, leans close to one of the monitor speakers. Before he can react, a frustrated Horst smashes a guitar into an amplifier whose volume Frankie has maximized. The noise is excruciating and the feedback knocks Frankie unconscious. The damage leaves him permanently deaf. Without his hearing, Frankie cannot complete his album. He loses his recording contract and his manager Max abandons him. Soon after, his wife Sonya leaves him. Frankie shuts himself into his home, which he has \\"soundproofed\\" with pillows in a desperate bid to recover his hearing, and his drug use intensifies. He sinks into a heavy depression, repeatedly throwing his body against the walls, and wrapping Roman candles around his head, either an attempt at suicide or a drastic way to recover his hearing, but dives into the pool before they ignite. Frankie flushes all his drugs down a toilet, but is tormented by a vision of a menacing badger, and when he fights and kills it, he learns that the badger is, in fact, himself. Frankie finds a deaf organization and meets Penelope, who coaches him in lip-reading. They become close, and eventually intimate. He confides his unhappiness at losing music, and she helps him perceive sound through visual and tactile methods instead. Frankie manages to devise a system for mixing songs, in which he watches an oscilloscope trace while resting his feet on the pulsating speakers. Using this system, he manages to produce a new mix CD (Hear No Evil) entirely by himself. He delivers it to Max, who is wildly pleased ‚Äì particularly by the potential of exploiting Frankie's disability to increase record sales. He has Frankie take part in promotions that are increasingly offensive and insensitive to deaf people, of which Penelope disapproves. Max convinces Frankie to play live at Pacha as a career comeback, despite Frankie's insistence that he has nothing to prove to his critics. The gig goes exceedingly well, and many claim it shows even greater talent than his early work. After the show, Frankie and Penelope disappear from Max and the music scene altogether. In a talking heads sequence, characters speculate on where he is now, if alive. As the film ends, we see Frankie disguised as a homeless street musician, who is met by Penelope and a child, presumably their own. They affectionately walk together down a street unrecognised. Additionally, we see Frankie teaching a group of deaf children how to perceive sound like he does. Characters and cast * Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye) is the king of DJs, slowly losing his hearing, and soon to lose everything he thinks is important to him: his job, his fame and his trophy wife. * Penelope (Beatriz Batarda) is the deaf lip-reading instructor who gives Frankie the tough love he never had and always needed. * Sonya (Kate Magowan) is Frankie's supermodel wife. Her days are filled with deciding on what theme is more appropriate for their garden: Japanese or Spanish? * Max Haggar (Mike Wilmot) is Frankie's agent. Fat, balding and brash, Max is all about money and his mobile phone is his lifeline. * Jack Stoddart (Neil Maskell) is the ruthless CEO of Motor Records who has no sympathy for Frankie. He says, \\"I didn‚Äôt want a deaf DJ on the label. I didn‚Äôt want the company to be touched with the deaf stamp. Well, business is tough and sometimes you have to make awkward decisions and I‚Äôve made harder decisions than dropping the deaf DJ.\\" =Cameos= Several real world DJs appear in the film, lending the film a sense of authenticity, like Carl Cox, Fatboy Slim and Pete Tong himself, who also executive produced the film. Others include Ti√´sto, Sarah Main, Barry Ashworth, Paul van Dyk and Lol Hammond. Fubar rockers Paul Spence and David Lawrence, from Dowse's earlier film, also have cameos as Austrian hangers-on. Music =Soundtrack= The film's soundtrack was released by EMI on 4 October 2005 as a double disc soundtrack for the film. The 'Night' & 'Day' concept for the soundtrack album was conceived and compiled by Ben Cherrill, who was, at the time, A&R; manager for Positiva Records/EMI.

The U.S. version of the DVD includes 5.1 Dolby Digital, subtitles and several extras that were part of the online/web marketing campaign: Frankie Wilde: The Rise, Frankie Wilde: The Fall and Frankie Wilde: The Redemption. Reception =Commercial performance= The film made $2,226,603, a little under a quarter million above its $2 million budget. =Critical response= The film has a rating of 76% based on 71 reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the critical consensus stating, \\"Part raucous mockumentary, part drama-filled biopic, It's All Gone Pete Tong amuses and warms hearts with its touching, comic, and candid look at a musician faced with a career-ending handicap.\\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 56 based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Giving the film three stars, Roger Ebert says the film works because of its \\"heedless comic intensity\\", chronicling the rise and fall of Frankie Wilde in the film's first two acts \\"as other directors have dealt with emperors and kings\\". > Frankie may not be living the most significant life of our times, but tell > that to Frankie. There is a kind of desperation in any club scene (as > 24-Hour Party People memorably demonstrated); it can be exhausting, having a > good time, and the relentless pursuit of happiness becomes an effort to > recapture remembered bliss from the past. Melissa Mohaupt writing in Exclaim! noted \\"resemblances to various hipster films about music, drugs, excess and failure\\" such as Trainspotting, Boogie Nights, yet it \\"never feels stale\\". There are plenty of quotable quips, and even Frankie's attempted suicide is \\"high-larious\\". She says the film manages to be \\"uplifting without being preachy or cheesy. There are important life lessons to be learned here, or you could just ignore them and enjoy some clever comedy.\\" Ken Eisner of The Georgia Straight liked the film's \\"zippy visual style, with sun-dappled primary colours and whirlwind editing to go with the hip pop tunes and block-rockin' beats\\". He appreciated the fact that Dowse does not milk the many cameos, though the two Fubar actors may have been a bit much. Dennis Harvey, writing for Variety, found those first two acts depressing and decidedly not as advertized (the film was hyped as another This is Spinal Tap), but Michael Dowse rescues the film with \\"a particularly deft transitional montage that begins with Frankie discovering the musical properties of vibration... segues into lead duo's first lovemaking, and goes on as Frankie re-connects with the dance rhythms he‚Äôd thought were lost to him\\". Nick De Semlyen, writing for Empire, gave the film two stars, noting there were powerful moments in the film, but thought it was \\"too dark for casual viewers (or fans of Tong), too blunt to succeed as cult viewing\\". The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the film one star, panning it as \\"breathtakingly charmless and humourless\\", writing that \\"Paul Kaye gives a frazzled, one-note performance\\", while the \\"appearances by real-life DJs should tip you off that any satire involved is of an essentially celebratory and sycophantic sort; the comedy is leaden, the drama is flat and the attitude to deaf people is Neanderthal\\". =Accolades= Awards * Toronto International Film Festival, Best Canadian Feature ‚Äì 2004 * US Comedy Arts Festival, Best Feature, Best Actor (Paul Kaye) ‚Äì 2005 * Gen Art Film Festival, Grand Jury Award, Audience Award ‚Äì 2005 * Vancouver Film Critics Circle, Best British Columbian Film ‚Äì 2005 * Canadian Comedy Awards, Best Performance by a Male - Film (Mike Wilmot) ‚Äì 2005 * Leo Awards Best Overall Sound, Best Sound Editing, Best Feature-Length Drama ‚Äì 2005 Nominations * Method Fest, Best Actor, Best Feature * BIFA, Best Achievement in Production * Genie Awards (8) Adaptations The film was remade in Hindi by the Indian film director Neerav Ghosh, titled Soundtrack and was released in 2011.

It is an incomplete highway, with a 3.85-mile (6.20 km) western section and a 0.73-mile (1.17 km) eastern section; both sections comprise New York State Route 987H (NY 987H), the unsigned reference route assigned to the road by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Crompond Road (U.S. Route 202 and NY 35) provides a connection between the two sections. Collectively, the parkway extends from an intersection with US 6, US 9, and US 202 southeast of the Bear Mountain Bridge to an interchange with the Taconic State Parkway in Yorktown. The parkway was built in 1932 but, unlike most other parkways in Westchester County, it has barely been constructed upon since. The initial reason for the Bear Mountain Parkway was to connect the Taconic State Parkway (or then, the Bronx River Parkway Extension) to the Bear Mountain Bridge. The Tappan Zee Bridge became a more popular Hudson River crossing following its construction, and consequently, the Bear Mountain Parkway was never finished. Route description The parkway begins at an intersection with US 6, US 9 and US 202 south of Annsville Creek in Peekskill and proceeds eastward through the north side of Peekskill as a two-lane undivided roadway. During its first mile, the parkway intersects a street at- grade and connects to Highland Avenue by way of an interchange before widening to three divided lanes (two westbound, one eastbound) at an interchange with North Division Street. The parkway intersects another street at-grade prior to entering Cortlandt. In Cortlandt, the parkway meets US 6 at an interchange and becomes a two lane undivided roadway again and meets several surface roads ahead of an intersection with US 202 and NY 35\\\\. Here, the Bear Mountain Parkway merges with the two-lane US 202 and NY 35, creating a physical but not official concurrency extending eastward into neighboring Yorktown. Roughly one mile from the town line, the parkway separates from US 202 and NY 35 and progresses to the northeast as a four-lane undivided roadway. After a short distance, the parkway becomes separated by a median prior to merging with the southbound Taconic State Parkway. The northbound Taconic Parkway is accessed by way of US 202 and NY 35\\\\. NY 987H, the internal NYSDOT designation for the parkway, terminates at both ends of the physical overlap with US 202 and NY 35 and applies only to the segments of the road separate from US 202 and NY 35. The parkway was designated but not signed as NY 821 prior to the creation of the current reference route system. History Originally proposed by Robert Moses, the Bear Mountain State Parkway was built between 1929 and 1932 by the Westchester County Parks Commission as part of the Bronx River Parkway's extension into northern Westchester County. It was intended to provide a quick, scenic trip from the Bronx to the Bear Mountain Bridge and Harriman State Park. In 1941, the Taconic State Park Commission assumed control of the Bronx River extension. The commission subsequently combined the north‚Äìsouth portion of the extension with the then-Eastern State Parkway to create the Taconic State Parkway. The east‚Äìwest section of the extension between the Taconic Parkway and Annsville was renamed the Bear Mountain State Parkway. At the time of the parkway's construction, the Bear Mountain Bridge was an extremely important crossing of the Hudson River for Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, and Orange County residents. The construction of the Tappan Zee Bridge and the traffic issues caused by the two-lane roads descending to the Bear Mountain Bridge have diminished the bridge's popularity since then, and consequently, the Bear Mountain Parkway was never finished. In 2000, there was an initiative to complete the final missing piece of the Bear Mountain Parkway, since all of the right of way has already been acquired. However, this never came to fruition.

When his group's album failed to chart, they were dropped and Morgan was mentored by producer Robert Brookins. Morgan was also labelmates with singer Chant√© Moore at Warner Bros., but her album never saw the light of day due to Jay King losing the production deal over the failure of the second Club Nouveau album.

In the early 1990s, Morgan wrote and produced songs for Lalah Hathaway, Martha Wash, and Usher, among others. Outside of R&B;, Morgan also worked in house music in the mid 2000s. Around the early 2010s, he was summoned by DJ Khalil to work on a few projects with him. Khalil's desire to work with him caused Morgan to relocate from Sacramento back to Los Angeles.

Numerous lakes and farms are situated in and around the village and the lakes are popular fishing areas. There is a yearly firework display at the circuit which is well attended by residents and locals. History Kirkby was named after the Mallory family, most prominently Sir Anketil Malory (1341-1393), a knight and governor of the castle and town of Leicester in the time of Richard II. In 1564, the population consisted of 25 families. In 1675, Sir Thomas Neale (Noell, Noel, etc.) became 3rd Baronet of Kirkby Mallory and inherited Kirkby Manor from his father Baronet William Neale. In 1696, Thomas's brother, Sir John Neale (father of Clobery and William), left an interesting rent roll listing the tenants and their rents and referring to Sir John's mansion house or hall with attached woods worth 3,000 pounds and ‚Äúa large park, very well wooded, and stocked with deer‚Äù.

Moses Kimball (October 24, 1809 ‚Äì February 21, 1895) was a US politician and showman. Kimball was a close associate of P. T. Barnum, and public-spirited citizen of Boston, Massachusetts. Biography Kimball was descended from Richard and Ursula Kimball, who came from England to Massachusetts in 1634 and were among the founders of the town of Ipswich, Massachusetts. Kimball was born in Ipswich to David and Nancy (Stacy) Kimball, and raised in Rockport, Massachusetts but moved to Boston at 15 to seek his fortune. He was ruined first in the \\"Eastern Land\\" speculation, and then again in 1833 in his purchase of the New England Galaxy, one of the earliest weekly newspapers of Boston, which was sold after a few months at a serious loss. Kimball married Frances L. A. Hathaway on June 25, 1834, and in 1836 started the New England Printing Company but it collapsed in 1837. In 1838 Kimball purchased most of the New England Museum, added to it, made arrangements for a lease of the building on Tremont and Bromfield streets (later the site of the Horticultural Hall). In 1840, Kimball travelled just twenty miles northwest to the new mill city, Lowell, MA and founded the Lowell Museum. Then in 1841, Moses opened the Boston Museum. The museum, rebuilt in 1846 and 1880, displayed a large number of stuffed birds and animals (later owned by the Boston Society of Natural History), several remains of Greek sculpture (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), and several historical portraits by John Singleton Copley. The Museum was immediately successful. In the late spring of 1842, Kimball traveled to New York City to meet his rival, P. T. Barnum, in person. He brought with him a large oblong box containing a most unusual curiosity: an embalmed mermaid purchased at great price near Calcutta by a Boston sea captain in 1817. If it wasn't a real mermaid, it was a remarkable fraud: the head of a baboon and the upper half of an orangutan was attached to the lower half of a large fish. On June 18, Barnum and Kimball entered into a written agreement to exploit this \\"curiosity supposed to be a mermaid.\\" Kimball would remain the creature's sole owner and Barnum would lease it for $12.50 a week. Barnum christened his artifact \\"The Fejee Mermaid\\" and began to \\"puff\\" her to the skies. Boston Museum in 1851 By 1843, Kimball and P. T. Barnum were on the best of terms, and trading objects from their collections frequently. That same year they bought Charles Willson Peale's Museum in Philadelphia for $7,000 when it went out of business, and Barnum wrote to Kimball about the death of a prized live orangutan: Boston Museum advertisement from 1872 That same year, Kimball added a theater to his museum, although he called it a \\"lecture-room\\" in deference to the Puritan feeling in Boston. There he staged his own adaptations of Uncle Tom's Cabin among other productions. =Political life= As Kimball's fortune grew, he became an active public citizen. His first appearance in political life was in 1844, as a consequence of a speech by Daniel Webster, in which he urged the revision of the US naturalization laws in reaction to the Irish vote. As early as 1850, he offered a prize for the best essay on the treatment and prevention of croup. In 1849 and 1850 Kimball was elected as a member of the Common Council for Ward 10, he served as a city counciler in 1850 and 1851. In 1851 he was elected to the City Board of Aldermen serving as a member of the Board of Aldermen in 1852. While never elected to the office, Kimball ran three times for Mayor of the City of Boston. In 1858 he garnered 4,449 votes while losing to Frederic W. Lincoln, Jr. In 1860 Kimball ran as the Republican Party candidate, for Mayor of the city of Boston losing to Joseph Wightman. On that day, December 13, 1860, Kimball received 5,674 votes to Wightman's 8,834 votes. In 1868 he once again ran for Mayor, losing to Nathaniel Bradstreet Shurtleff, Sr. (Kimball received 9,156 votes to Shurtleff's 11,005 votes.) =Later years= Twenty years later, he established a prize for the best exhibit of shade trees set out in the streets of Rockport, Massachusetts, and for the best loaf of bread exhibited at the annual fair. Kimball made three journeys to Europe, in 1867, 1872 and 1877 to 1878. In 1879 Kimball donated to Boston a copy of Thomas Ball's sculpture Emancipation Group. Sited in Park Square it depicts an emancipated slave rising at the feet of Abraham Lincoln (Ball was a former employee of Kimball's.) In his will he left $5,000 for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Death Moses Kimball died in 1895, aged 85. In 1903 the famous Boston Museum was swept away.

Cabrera played 6 Major Leagues games batting .211. bunting for the New York Yankees in 2007 2006 season Cabrera saw a lot of time in spring training of 2006 with starting outfielders Johnny Damon and Bernie Williams playing in the World Baseball Classic. He impressed the Yankees by hitting .349 in 16 games, but was ultimately sent down to Triple-A Columbus at the start of the season. He started the season strongly at Triple-A Columbus, hitting .385 with 4 home runs and 24 RBIs in just 31 games before being called up on May 9, 2006 after left fielder Hideki Matsui broke his wrist and was on the disabled list until September 12, 2006. Cabrera replaced him in left field, and hit .318 in May with his first 10 career RBIs and two career stolen bases. On May 30, 2006, batting leadoff for only the second time in his career, he recorded his first career 4-hit game, going 4-for-6. He slumped in June, but hit his first major league home run on June 15. On June 6, 2006, in the 8th inning of a 2‚Äì1 game against the Red Sox, he made an outstanding catch in left-center, leaping over the wall to take a home run away from Boston slugger Manny Ram√≠rez. This play earned Cabrera a \\"This Year In Baseball\\" award (voted on by the fans) for the outstanding play of the 2006 season. Cabrera heated up again in July, hitting .313 with 14 RBIs. He had his first career five-RBI game on July 5, with his first career grand slam. On the 18th, he hit his first career walk-off home run. At 22, he was the second youngest Yankee ever to hit a walk-off home run, to the 21-year-old Mickey Mantle in 1953. He finished the 2006 season tied for second in the league with 12 outfield assists. In 130 games, Cabrera batted .280 with 7 home runs and 50 RBI. 2007 season Cabrera was slotted as fourth outfielder at the beginning of the 2007 season. He struggled, batting only .200 in April and .254 in May with limited playing time. He was batting .223 on the season when Jason Giambi went on the disabled list on June 1, 2007, giving him more playing time as Damon assumed Giambi's role of designated hitter and Cabrera took over center field from Damon. After this, he hit .320 with 3 of his 5 home runs and 21 of his 36 RBIs. He also had a 13-game hitting streak from July 1 to 17. While Bobby Abreu was struggling that month, Cabrera hit second to enable Derek Jeter to hit third and cemented himself as the Yankees' starting center fielder, causing Giambi to compete with Damon for DH at-bats after returning from the DL. Cabrera had a career-high hitting streak of 19 games, while continued to get his share of walks. Prior to the July 31 trade deadline, the Texas Rangers offered Yankee GM Brian Cashman their closer, √âric Gagn√©, in exchange for Cabrera, but Cashman declined and Cabrera went on to tie for third in outfield assists (16) for the season. In 150 games to finish 2007, Cabrera batted .273 with 8 home runs and 73 RBI. 2008 season New York Yankees in 2009 Cabrera was involved in a bench-clearing brawl against the Tampa Bay Rays in a 2008 spring training game. MLB claimed to have seen video showing Cabrera punching superstar Tampa third baseman Evan Longoria during the brawl, and suspended him for two games along with teammate Shelley Duncan. Third base coach Bobby Meacham and hitting coach Kevin Long were also fined an undisclosed amount for their actions in the brawl. Cabrera was a less-than-adequate hitter for the Yankees in 2008. His fielding and strong throwing arm in center field could not make up for his poor batting average. In early August, Yankee manager Joe Girardi demoted him to fourth outfielder, making Damon the everyday center fielder again. On August 15, 2008, Cabrera was demoted to Triple-A's Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, but recalled him on September 5. Playing 129 games in 2008, Cabrera finished with a .249 batting average, 8 home runs, and 37 RBI. 2009 season After the 2008 season, the Yankees came close to trading Cabrera to the Milwaukee Brewers for veteran outfielder, Mike Cameron. Remaining with the Yankees, Cabrera competed with Brett Gardner for the starting center field job which Gardner won, relegating Cabrera to a backup role by manager Girardi once again. On April 22, however, Cabrera hit the first walk-off hit in the New Yankee Stadium, a 2-run homer in the bottom of the 14th, for a 9‚Äì7 Yankee win. By late April, with Gardner slumping and Cabrera's streak of stellar play, Cabrera once again became the starting center fielder. He won the Major League Baseball Clutch Performer of the Month of May. On August 2, 2009, he became the first Yankee to hit for the cycle since Tony Fern√°ndez did on September 3, 1995. The home run was his 10th of the season, a new personal high. He also collected his 200th career RBI in the game, and finished the season with a .274 batting average, 13 home runs, and 68 RBI in 154 games. The Yankees finished the year with a 103-59 record and eventually won the World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies, giving Cabrera his first championship title and the Yankees their 27th title overall. Atlanta Braves in 2010 =Atlanta Braves= On December 22, 2009, the Yankees traded Cabrera to the Atlanta Braves with Mike Dunn and pitching prospect Arodys Vizcaino for Javier V√°zquez and Boone Logan, with whom he signed a one-year deal worth $3.1 million with the Braves, avoiding arbitration. Cabrera hit .255 with 4 home runs and 42 RBIs in 115 games for the 2010 Braves, and went 0-for-8 in the 2010 NLDS against the San Francisco Giants, who won the series three games to one. He batted eighth for the Braves and was described as \\"pudgy\\" and not diligent enough about his career to keep his weight down. The Braves released him on October 19. =Kansas City Royals= On December 9, 2010, Cabrera signed a one-year, $1.25 million contract with the Kansas City Royals, eager for an opportunity to start consistently and hit in the middle of the lineup. In his 2011 breakout season, he set career highs in RBIs (87), runs scored (102), stolen bases (20), home runs (18) and batting average (.305), while finishing fourth in the American League in hits with 201 and becoming the sixth Royal to record at least 200 hits in a season. =San Francisco Giants= On November 7, 2011, the Royals traded Cabrera to the San Francisco Giants for Jonathan S√°nchez and minor league pitcher Ryan Verdugo, seeking to bolster their starting rotation and free up center field for Lorenzo Cain. San Francisco Giants in 2012 Cabrera started 2012 with a .275 career average, but on May 29 he surpassed Willie Mays for most hits in the month of May in San Francisco Giants history with 50. The next night, he tied Randy Winn's San Francisco record for most hits in any month with 51. His hot hitting earned him one of the three starting outfielder positions for the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Kansas City with 7,521,784 votes, the highest number received by a National League (NL) outfielder that year. He singled in the first and hit a two-run homer in the fourth (the only round-tripper of the game) and was voted the All-Star Game MVP in the NL's 8‚Äì0 shutout win, going 2-for-3 with the two RBIs. He was the fifth Giant player to be honored as All-Star Game MVP. On August 15, 2012, Cabrera was suspended for 50 games without pay for testing positive for high levels of testosterone, suggesting usage of MLB-proscribed performance-enhancing drugs. He admitted using a banned substance and was forced to accept the suspension. The suspension was effective immediately, meaning that Cabrera would take no further part for the remainder of the 2012 season. The suspension would also rule him out to start the 2013 season or if the Giants play enough games in the postseason (if the team clinched). Prior to his suspension, he led the majors with 159 hits and was second in the NL with a .346 batting average. He ended his suspension-shortened season with 11 home runs, 10 triples, 60 RBI and 13 stolen bases in 18 opportunities. One of Cabrera's associates purchased a website for $10,000 and falsified its contents in a way that would have allowed Cabrera to challenge his suspension by claiming that the positive test was caused by a substance sold through that website, but MLB officials and federal investigators used forensics to trace the website back to Cabrera. At his own request, Cabrera was ruled ineligible to win the 2012 NL batting title. As the Giants clinched a postseason berth, Cabrera's suspension officially expired during the 2012 National League Championship Series. Although the suspension expired, the team decided to shut down Cabrera for the remainder of the postseason and revert him to the restricted list. The Giants would then go on to win the 2012 World Series over the Detroit Tigers. Despite his suspension, Cabrera received a 2012 World Series ring for his contributions to the team before his suspension. =Toronto Blue Jays= 2013 season Cabrera signed a two-year contract for $16 million with the Toronto Blue Jays on November 19, 2012. In a game against the Detroit Tigers on April 9, 2013, Cabrera recorded his 1,000th career hit, a single off starter An√≠bal S√°nchez. Cabrera battled a sore hamstring and quadriceps muscle through the first two months of the regular season, but the injuries did not warrant time on the disabled list. Cabrera was occasionally removed from games in the later innings to rest his legs. Toronto Blue Jays on 2013 Opening Day In early June, it was reported that Major League Baseball would be pursuing suspensions for players implicated in the Biogenesis scandal, including Cabrera. Cabrera could have faced supplemental discipline regardless of the fact that he served a 50-game suspension at the end of the 2012 regular season, as MLB planned to further suspend players involved in the scandal for trying to cover their use of banned substances by using pseudonyms to purchase Biogenesis products or for falsely denying any involvement whatsoever. Cabrera responded to the speculation about a second suspension, saying \\"If they suspend me again, I think that would be a harsh punishment because I already served my sentence. But it's up to them. I believe I've already served my sentence, especially missing the playoffs. That's what hurt me the most.\\" Cabrera was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 27 due to left knee tendinitis. Fan and player favorite Munenori Kawasaki was called up to take Cabrera's roster spot. Cabrera returned from the disabled list on July 21 and played in 10 games before going back on the 15-day DL with irritation in his left knee. Neil Wagner was recalled to take Cabrera's roster spot. On August 5, 2013, Cabrera was among several implicated players not suspended following the resolution of the Biogenesis investigation. It was reported on August 8 that Cabrera would be out of the lineup until at least September for a left knee injury. Manager John Gibbons told reporters on August 22 that Cabrera would not play for the rest of the season. On September 7, Toronto general manager Alex Anthopoulos told reporters that Cabrera had undergone a successful surgery to remove a benign tumor from his lower spine on August 30, and that a full recovery was expected. Shortened to 88 games in 2013, Cabrera batted .279 with 3 home runs and 30 RBI. 2014 season Having recovered from his offseason surgery, Cabrera played fully in 2014 spring training, and led the majors in hits and doubles during the spring with 30 and 10 respectively. He hit his only home run in the final game of spring training, a two-run shot to help the Blue Jays win 2‚Äì0 over the New York Mets on March 29 in Montreal. On April 4, 2014, Cabrera became the first MLB player to bat against Masahiro Tanaka, and hit a lead-off solo home run off of him. He would go on to record a four-game home run streak, besting his total of home runs from the previous season (3 in 88 games played). Cabrera broke a Blue Jays team record on April 13, by hitting in his 13th consecutive game to open the season. He would continue his hot hitting to open the season, setting another new Blue Jays franchise record for hits prior to May 1, when he recorded his 40th hit in a game against the Kansas City Royals on April 29. On May 1, he and teammate Mark Buehrle were named the co-winners of the Honda Player of the Month Award for April. Cabrera recorded his 500th career RBI on July 26, 2014, to aid the Blue Jays in breaking their 17-game losing streak at Yankee Stadium. On August 10, Cabrera drew a team-record 5 walks in a 6‚Äì5 win over the Detroit Tigers in 19 innings; the longest game in franchise history. He also became the first player to reach base 8 times in one game (the aforementioned 5 walks along with 3 hits) since Hall-of-Famer Rod Carew did so in 1972. In a game against the Boston Red Sox on September 5, Cabrera was injured while diving back to first base in the third inning and left the game. He remained in the game but came out during his next at-bat in the sixth inning and was taken for x-rays, where it was determined that he had broken his right little finger and would require surgery, ending his 2014 season. At the time of his injury, he had 171 hits, second in the league to Jos√© Altuve, and had a .301 batting average. Coming to the end of his two-year contract with the Blue Jays, Cabrera expressed a desire to re-sign with Toronto. On November 1, the Blue Jays extended a qualifying offer to Cabrera for $15.3 million, which he later rejected. =Chicago White Sox= After the 2014 season, Cabrera signed a three-year, $42 million contract with the Chicago White Sox. In his first season with the White Sox in 2015, Cabrera played 158 games batting .273 with 36 doubles, 12 home runs, and 77 RBIs. In his second season with the White Sox in 2016, Cabrera played 151 games batting .296 with 14 home runs. In his third year with the White Sox before being traded to the Kansas City Royals, Cabrera batted .295 with 13 home runs and 56 RBIs in 98 games. =Return to Kansas City= The White Sox traded Cabrera to the Royals for A. J. Puckett and Andre Davis on July 30, 2017. =Cleveland Indians= On April 25, 2018, Cabrera signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. On May 20, he was called up by the Indians. Cabrera was designated for assignment on June 14, cleared waivers on June 18, and elected free agency. He re-signed a minor league contract with the Indians on July 5, 2018. The Indians purchased Cabrera's contract for a second time on July 20, 2018. He elected free agency on October 29, 2018. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On February 10, 2019, Cabrera signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates that included an invitation to spring training. On March 23, the Pirates announced that Cabrera had made the opening day roster. In 2019, he batted .280/.313/.399. He had the slowest sprint speed of all National League right fielders, at 25.9 feet/second. He had the worst jump of all major league outfielders (-4.9 feet vs. average). =New York Mets= On June 29, 2020, the New York Mets signed Cabrera.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2898148-melky-cabrera-signs-mets- contract-won-world-series-with-yankees-in-2009 He was released on July 22. Personal life In the offseason, Cabrera lives in Miami. Cabrera and Robinson Can√≥ became close friends as teammates in the minor leagues. He has a son in the Dominican Republic named Melky Jr. and two daughters who live with their respective mothers in New York and Orlando. His nickname around the Yankee clubhouse was \\"Leche\\" which is Spanish for \\"milk.\\" While with the Giants, he had a cheering section called \\"The Melkmen\\" in the AT&T; Park stands during his record 51 hits in May 2012 although it disbanded after his 50-game suspension. Cabrera is involved in charity work in his native Dominican Republic.

Gecekondu (Turkish for put up overnight, plural gecekondular) is a Turkish word meaning a house put up quickly without proper permissions, a squatter's house, and by extension, a shanty or shack. Gecekondu b√∂lgesi is a neighborhood made of those gecekondular. Gecekondu neighborhoods offer an affordable alternative for shelter for many low-income households who can not afford to purchase or rent formal housing. Etymology A gecekondu neighbourhood. In Turkish, gece means \\"at night\\" and kondu means \\"placed\\" (from the verb konmak, \\"to settle\\" or \\"to be placed\\"); thus the term gecekondu comes to mean \\"placed (built) overnight\\". And b√∂lge means a \\"zone\\", \\"district\\" or even \\"region\\", so a gecekondu b√∂lgesi is a \\"suddenly built-up shanty-neighborhood.\\" Usage A gecekondu street in West Istanbul. In common usage, it refers to the low cost apartment buildings or houses that were constructed in a very short time by people migrating from rural areas to the outskirts of the large cities. Robert Neuwirth writes in his book Shadow Cities that these squatters are exploiting a legal loophole which states that if one starts building after dusk and moves into a completed house before dawn the next day without having been noticed by the authorities, then the next day the authorities are not permitted to tear the building down but instead must begin a legal proceeding in court (and thus it is more likely one can stay). Such buildings may be constructed without going through the necessary procedures required for construction, such as acquiring building permits, and can be very densely populated. Neuwirth stated in 2004 that \\"half the residents of Istanbul - perhaps six million people - dwell in gecekondu homes\\".Neuwirth, R (2004). Shadow Cities: A Billion Squatters, A New Urban World, Routledge , Page 8. Despite connotations of urban poverty and overcrowding, almost all gecekondu neighbourhoods are supplied with running water and electricity. The gecekondu phenomenon is directly linked with the problems of unemployment and poverty in the rural areas of Turkey, especially in the east of the country. In many instances entire villages have migrated to the outskirts of the large industrialized cities in order to seek a better standard of living. At present, some gecekondu areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass-housing compounds developed by the government's Mass Housing Development Administration (TOKƒ∞). Gecekondular are present both in small Turkish towns and in large cities such as Izmir, Ankara and Istanbul.

They broadcast at 88.7 MHz on the FM dial. History Prior to its switch to all-classical, it was a college rock station from 1988 until 1996. Billing itself as the \\"hundred-thousand milliwatt of the River City\\", KAGU broadcast a 100 watt signal throughout Spokane. Other slogans included \\"your only alternative\\" and \\"proletariat and bourgeoisie alike agree!\\" In its first year, KAGU was largely relegated to a radio format of Adult contemporary music with student reports of news and sports as live lab voice work. But in 1987‚Äì89 things changed with KAGU when Station Manager John Hipp developed radio shows that were cutting edge college radio. By year's end in 1988 there was a renaissance of student shows that stand as some of the station's most creative and exciting productions. Among the repertoire were live sports broadcasts, live speaker series, live theatre audiocasts, live weekly music shows, and student-sponsored music genre shows. Notable among the broadcasts at the time were the shows Folk Stew which showcased live Spokane, Washington regional folk and blues musicians, the Cork the Tuna's Skipped Grooves show on which Steve MacCorkle brought the edge of his bay area roots and love for alternative new wave and punk tunes, and John Hipp's show The Hippster Radio Identity Crisis which was a cornucopia of musical treasures & Dead Before Midnight featuring Live Grateful Dead bootlegs. These are notable examples of the early days of KAGU, but there were other student shows which also added to the vibe and fabric of the exciting first years of the station. A marketing high point was achieved when the infamous trailer \\"Fish For Breakfast\\" was broadcast in 1994. The concept was simple: the voiceover stated \\"Fish For Breakfast, and KAGU every night. That's the way it oughtta be!\\" Daily programming included alternative rock and specialty shows from 7 AM to midnight. In late 2004, the KAGU transmitter and antennae were moved from atop the GU Administration Building to the KHQ-TV tower site on Tower Mountain in southeast Spokane. Also, KAGU‚Äôs power was boosted from 100 watts to 5,000 watts. Currently, the KAGU signal reaches a 60-mile radius from Tower Mountain. The station currently follows a commercial-free, all-classical music format. It is the Spokane affiliate of the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts.

It appears in various forms in the 1987 series, the TMNT Adventures comics, the 2012 series, the IDW comics, and the UK Hero Turtles comics. Fictional history Dimension X is a parallel dimension that has various adaptions in each media appearance: =1987 cartoon= In the 1987 cartoon, Dimension X is the home of several characters, most notably Krang, one of the series' main antagonists. Krang typically uses the Dimensional Portal located inside the Technodrome for transportation between Dimension X and Earth, although other portals and means of travel are occasionally seen. It is depicted as a hostile, war torn kingdom with foreboding landscapes and many fierce monsters. Although it is also home to many peaceful species such as the Neutrinos. =Archie comics= In the Archie Comics, Dimension X is a spiral galaxy in which numerous inhabited (or habitable) worlds are located. It was originally governed by theocrats, banishing all warlords. Later, there's a conflict between the Imperial Aerwyl Fleet and the Nova Squadron. =IDW Comics= In the IDW Comics, Dimension X is depicted as a warzone controlled by Krang where the Utroms, the Triceratons, and the Neutrinos are fighting for their planets. =2012 TV series= In the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series, Dimension X is the home dimension of the Kraang and the Utrom. So far, it is known that the pink air of the Kraang's part of Dimension X is nitrogen mixed with sulfur and that it is very foggy. The water of Dimension X has hydrocarbon that can melt anything in the Dimension of Earth. For some reason, the water had no effect on April O'Neil when some of it was accidentally splashed on her (it was later revealed to be because she's a human/Kraang hybrid which also made her immune to the Mutagen's effects). In the episode \\"Into Dimension X,\\" it is revealed that time moves faster in Dimension X, with Leatherhead spending decades there within the period of a year passing on Earth. Dimension X is also home to the Triceratons in this series and has served as the battleground for a war between them and the Kraang. =2016 film= Dimension X was featured, unnamed, in the 2016 sequel film to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The filmmakers first expressed interest in featuring the Dimension X in the sequel in 2014. In the film, Shredder is transported from a police convoy to the Technodrome in Dimension X in which he agrees to help Krang conquer Earth. The Technodrome is later transported to Earth in the film's climax, though the Turtles manage to return it to Dimension X. The film never shows the Dimension X's exterior as the only scene taking place there is inside the Technodrome, while it appears off-screen in the climax. Natives/residents =Krang= Krang is a brain-like alien warlord exiled from Dimension X and has ever since been doing business with Shredder. =Utrom= The Utrom are the benevolent brain-like beings of Dimension X. In the 2003 series, the Utrom live on another planet. In the 2012 TV series, millions of Utrom residing in Dimension X were overpowered by Kraang's terribly powerful mental abilities and became enslaved copies of himself known as \\"the Kraang.\\" The few remaining Utrom are the Utrom Council, consisting of four members: Queen, Bishop, Rook and Pawn. Originally a fifth member was \\"Knight\\" but became known as Kraang Subprime since being brainwashed by the deranged Kraang Prime. =Lord Dregg= Lord Dregg is an alien warlord from Dimension X who replaced Shredder as the main antagonist in the last two seasons of the 1987 cartoon, voiced by Tony Jay. In his first appearances, he attempted to take over the world, but his plans were constantly foiled by the Turtles. Eventually, he started a smear campaign against them, which turned the citizens of New York against them and in favor of him. This all came to an end in the episode \\"Doomquest\\". He is unable to fight the titular villain, and when the Turtles do so, he flees in fear, and the populace finally discover that the Turtles were heroes and Dregg was the villain (after April showed them a tape of his true motives). His last attempt involved using a robotic suit to absorb the powers of several other aliens, and kill the Turtles. His plan failed after Donatello and Michelangelo used Krang's android body to shrink him down and banish him to Dimension X. It is presumed that Dregg had died after being banished into Dimension X, because according to Donatello, Krang's android body would explode a few seconds after it shrunk down. A new version of Dregg who's named Vringath appeared in the fourth season of the 2012 cartoon, voiced by Peter Stormare. He appears as an insectoid crime lord originating from the Planet Sectoid 1. When the Turtles incur his wrath while they were at a space port on a planet not being in the Federation, Dregg becomes one of their most dangerous enemies. He soon hires the bounty hunter Armaggon to hunt down the Turtles, later joining him in the Cosmic Ocean of Veruna in an effort to destroy the Turtles and claim a piece of the Black Hole Generator entrusted to the Daagon. Having been thwarted in this attempt, Dregg has Armaggon capture the Salamandrian G'Throkka/Sal Commander, and blackmails him and his comrade Mona Lisa/Y'gythgba into helping him capture the Turtles in exchange for sparing their world. However, after betraying them, Dregg is defeated by the Turtles and Salamandrians working together and apparently revealed to be a cyborg insect lifeform. Dregg then tracks the Turtles to Magdomar, home of the last Black Hole Generator fragment, in order to exact revenge for their destruction of his Scorpinoid. After failing to defeat them alone, Dregg contacted the Triceratons, offering to help them locate the generator fragment in exchange for a hefty bounty and the Turtles for his own vengeance. He then struck again, only to be apparently knocked into a sea of lava; however, he then swoops in during the confrontation between the Triceratons, Turtles, and Tokka and succeeds in stealing the fragment. Pursued by a flight-capable Tokka, he offers the Triceratons the fragment in exchange for saving him from her and an even larger bounty than earlier agreed upon. The Triceratons allow him on board their flagship but then jettison him into space. Dregg survived and teamed up with Newtrilizer in a plot to unleash the Vreen on New York City and take over Salamandria. Both of them are defeated by the Turtles, Sal Commander, and Mona Lisa. =Antrax= Antrax is a character from the 1987 animated series and toyline. He looks like a giant ant wearing the executioner's hood and outfit, and armed with an appropriate axe. In both the toy and the show, he's labeled as \\"Dimension X's executioner\\" which makes him an alien rather than another mutant. He appeared once in the 1987 cartoon series episode \\"Night of the Rogues\\" voiced by Pat Fraley. Shredder called some of the Turtles' past foes together consisting of Antrax, Rat King, Leatherhead, Slash, Tempestra, Chrome Dome, and Scumbug in hopes of defeating the turtles. This was the first appearance of Scumbug and Antrax. Antrax would later appear in the 2012 cartoon series as a mutant ant created by Stockman-Fly. He can reproduce by emitting his look-a-likes from his abdomen. =General Traag= General Traag is the leader of Krang's loyal Rock Soldiers from Dimension X. In the 1987 cartoon, Traag (voiced by Peter Renaday) came following the Neutrinos through the dimensional portal. After a small skirmish with the turtles, the Neutrinos teamed up with them and Michelangelo and Donatello sent both Traag and Granitor back through the portal and to their own dimension. Traag would make further appearances in the series until the eight season finale \\"Turtle Trek\\". As \\"Turtle Trek\\" ended with the Technodrome stranded in Dimension X it can be assumed Tragg is still in Dimension X somewhere. He appeared in Archie Comics arcade game, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers. In the IDW comics, he is called \\"Captain Tragg\\" and helped Krang in trying to conquer the home planet of the Neutrinos and completely escaped after the battle in which the END rocket from Professor Honeycutt put all of the weapons of Krang's forces out of action. In the 2012 cartoon, Traag is a 20 ft lava- spewing rock monster with regenerating abilities, who is in service to the Kraang. He first appeared in \\"TCRI,\\" where he was brought by the Kraang through a portal that connected TCRI to Dimension X. He proved to be a challenge to the Turtles, so Leatherhead ended up dragging him through the portal back to Dimension X. In \\"Showdown,\\" Traag was seen guarding the portal when the Kraang upgraded it with a force field. When the Turtles tried to destroy it, they drew the attention of him and the Kraang, so Leonardo used the laser to disintegrate Traag. In \\"Into Dimension X,\\" Traag teamed up with Granitor to attack the Turtles near the Kraang's facility in Dimension X. However, they were both defeated by Michelangelo in his \\"savage\\" suit when he used his voice to break apart the part of the cliff both rock monsters were on. Traag and Granitor alongside smaller Rock Soldiers were later summoned by the 80's Shredder and the 80's Kraang to attack New York where they fought the Ninja Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals. With help from the local Rocksteady and Bebop, the Ninja Turtles sent the Rock Soldiers back to Dimension X and defeated the 80's Shredder and the 80's Krang. =Sergeant Granitor= Sergeant Granitor is General Traag's right-hand man, and one of Krang's loyal Rock Soldiers from Dimension X. In the 1987 cartoon, Granitor (voiced by Pat Fraley) came to Earth following the Neutrinos through the dimensional portal, originally appearing inside the Technodrome. After a small skirmish with the turtles, where the turtles destroyed the rock warrior's weather-making machine, the Neutrinos teamed up with them and Michelangelo and Donatello sent both Granitor and General Tragg back through the portal and to Dimension X. He appeared in the arcade game as the 4th scene's (7th stage) boss, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers. In the IDW comics, he is called \\"Sergeant Granitor\\" and commanded an assault on a Neutrino resistance bunker, to capture the Fugitoid and bring him back to Krang. Due to Granitor's command, the Neutrino bunker was destroyed and many innocent Neutrinos killed along with Fugitoid's family. Later on he and several other Rock Soldiers was searching the demolished base for Fugitoid. Granitor realized that the Fugitoid was in fact Honeycutt and chased him through a portal to Earth. However, the Fugitoid used his morphing abilities to shapeshift himself into human form and get lost in the crowd. In the 2012 cartoon, Granitor is a 20 ft blue fire-spewing rock monster with regenerating abilities, who resembles Traag (but is pale-pink in color) and is in service to the Kraang. He first appeared in \\"Into Dimension X,\\" where he teamed up with Traag to attack the Turtles near the Kraang's facility in Dimension X. However, they were both defeated by Michelangelo in his \\"savage\\" suit when he used his voice to break apart the part of the cliff both rock monsters were on. Traag and Granitor alongside smaller Rock Soldiers were later summoned by the 80's Shredder and the 80's Kraang to attack New York where they fought the Ninja Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals. With help from the local Rocksteady and Bebop, the Ninja Turtles sent the Rock Soldiers back to Dimension X and defeated the 80's Shredder and the 80's Krang. =Bellybomb= Bellybomb is an alien outlaw with one eyestalk and a mouth on his stomach. In the Archie Comics, Bellybomb was sentenced to 17 life sentences on the toxic waste dump Morbus for extortion, armed robbery, man eating, brain poaching, soul thievery, and impersonating a deity named Bob. After Slash kills the guards on Morbus, Krang and Bellybomb escape with him. Upon the ship landing on an Eden World where Rocksteady and Bebop were on, the two of them accompanied the villains back to Earth. Once on Earth, Bellybomb grafts Krang to Shredder's body while the Turtles were busy fighting Rocksteady, Bebop, and Slash. After the Turtles freed Shredder from Krang's control, Bellybomb and Krang were sent back to Morbus while Slash escapes. In the 2012 cartoon, Vrax Belebome (voiced by Charlie Murphy) is a shady information dealer who the Fugitoid and the Ninja Turtles visit at Zayford's Cantina to get intel on the Triceraton mothership. After the Fugitoid's money was reclaimed by the Turtles following his claim of a down payment, Vrax contacted some Neutrino mercenaries to steal the information on the Black Hole Generator from Michelangelo's mind. Following the Neutrino mercenaries' defeat, Vrax was seen contacting Lord Dregg about the Neutrinos' mission and cuts him off when the Ninja Turtles return. Michelangelo intimidates Vrax to give them the plans for the Triceraton mothership which Vrax does. =Scale Tail= Scale Tail is a snake-like alien bounty hunter with snake-headed hands who first appeared in the 1993 video game Radical Rescue. In the 1992 toyline, Scale Tale is mentioned to be an ally of Krang. =Slash= Although Slash is technically an ordinary Earth turtle in the animated series, he is considered \\"native\\" to Dimension X since he was exposed to mutagen and took on his present form there. =Stump & Sling= Stump & Sling are two tree-like intergalactic wrestling promoters working on the Stump's Asteroid. =Wingnut and Screwloose= Locations =Balaraphon= Balaraphon is a planet inhabited by a peaceful species native to Dimension X. They were attacked unprovoked by an invasion fleet led by Krang and Shredder, but saved thanks to the interference of the TMNT (who had arrived on the planet). The TMNT's arrival on Balaraphon was the final phase of a plan by Shredder to exhaust and trap them after a period of exploration in Dimension X. It is also the scene of the Technodrome's final destruction as it was dragged down into the pit of a tentacled creature after its engines were blown out by the TMNT whilst escaping Shredder's trap. Balaraphon was seen in the original series episodes \\"Turtle Trek\\" and \\"Divide and Conquer.\\" The name Balaraphon was later used for a planet in the 2003 animated series, specifically it's \\"Fast Forward\\" season, in which it was apparently involved in an interplanetary war. Interstellar con man Torbin Zixx tricked the Turtles into helping him deliver medical supplies to the planet, unaware that the containers in which they were carried were in fact made of high-grade explosives. =Dimension X Penitentiary= Located on an unnamed planet or natural satellite, the Dimension X Penitentiary is where some of the worst criminals of Dimension X are being held. Convicts include Skaarg, Dementor, and the Dregma Brothers. Unfortunately, the penitentiary is not protected against dimensional portals, allowing Skarg, Dementor, and the Dregma Brothers to slip out while Irma and Vernon Fenwick slip through the portal from the Earth to Dimension X, ending up there inside one of the holding cells. It was seen in the episode \\"Convicts from Dimension X\\" of the 1987‚Äì1996 series. =Eden Worlds= The Eden Worlds appeared in the TMNT Adventures comics and are a group of planets reminiscent of the wildernesses of East Africa.

Cherubae sent Bebop and Rocksteady to an Eden World at the end of the \\"Turnstone\\" storyarc so that they could not do more \\"bad things.\\" The two of them are seen in leaf loincloths preparing to follow a herd of common warthogs and black rhinoceroses. With Krang and Bellybomb escaping in a spacecraft from Morbus, Bebop and Rocksteady hitched a ride with them when their ship stopped on their Eden World. While on Krang and Bellybomb's ship, Bebop and Rocksteady briefly returned to Earth in order to emigrate some local Central Park Zoo animals to their Eden World while picking up some clothes and weapons to use on the cages in the process. Once that was successful, Bebop and Rocksteady took Krang and Bellybomb back to Morbus before returning to their Eden World. Once the animals were released on their Eden World, Bebop and Rocksteady removed their clothes and went back to their simple life in the wilds. =Hirobyl= Hirobyl appeared in the TMNT Adventures comics and is a planet orbiting an aging and dying red giant star, located in a planetary system deep within Dimension X. But it was Krang who destroyed all life on the planet in its search for the Turnstone. The name of the planet is possibly a reference to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, since the planet is dying and the TMNT refer that a giant structure reminds much of the workers statues who can be seen in the former Soviet Union back in those days. =Huanu= Huanu was a planet that orbited a red star. It was the homeworld of Wingnut and Screwloose and their respective races, until Krang assaulted the world, destroying it and all its inhabitants, save the pair, who escaped and swore revenge on Krang. =Morbus= Morbus appeared in the TMNT Adventures comics and is a toxic waste dump and prison planet. Cherubae sent Krang to Morbus at the end of the \\"Turnstone\\" storyarc. It is on Morbus that Krang encounters Slash and Bellybomb.

The planet was deforested by the order of the Galactic President, who demanded all the palm trees to use as wood for his fireplace. =Serot= Serot is home to some slave pits and is run by Vorx.

From this asteroid, they host the Stump & Sling Intergalactic Wrestling, in the Stump Arena. Another alien, Cudley the Cowlick, is in charge of transporting the wrestlers to and from Stump Asteroid. In addition to the Turtles, who wrestled at Stump Asteroid twice, famous wrestlers include Ace Duck, Bloodbath, Cryin' Houn (who later changed his name to El Mysterio) and Leatherhead.

Career Cohen graduated with a political science degree in 1981 from Columbia University, where he began his broadcasting career with WKCR Sports. While at Columbia, he announced soccer games with future presidential adviser and Good Morning America host George Stephanopoulos.

Following WFAN's loss of the radio rights to St. John's games, Cohen began broadcasting Seton Hall games, which he continues to do to this day. He also served as a backup announcer on New York Rangers radio broadcasts, called Olympic hockey at the 1992, 1994, and 1998 Winter Olympics, and NCAA tournament games for Westwood One on multiple occasions. Cohen has called many notable moments in Mets history, such as Todd Pratt's walk-off home run in Game 4 of the 1999 NLDS that won the Mets the series, Robin Ventura's \\"grand slam single\\" in Game 5 of the 1999 NLCS, Benny Agbayani's walk off home run in Game 3 of the 2000 NLDS, the Mets winning the 2000 NLCS to advance to the World Series, Endy Chavez's home run robbing catch in Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS, Johan Santana's no-hitter on June 1, 2012, the first in Mets history, Wilmer Flores' walk-off home run against the Washington Nationals on July 31, 2015, the Mets' win against the Cincinnati Reds on September 26, 2015 to clinch the National League East, Bartolo Col√≥n's first Major League Baseball home run on May 7, 2016, at which he became the oldest MLB player in history to hit his first home run, Asdr√∫bal Cabrera winning an extra inning game for the Mets to keep them in an eventually successful playoff run, and Todd Frazier's ninth inning three run homer to tie the game in a successful ninth inning rally against the Washington Nationals on August 9, 2019.  Radio  Cohen's signature radio phrases, which he has carried over to television, include: *\\"And a pleasant good afternoon/evening everybody\\", used at the start of every game. *\\"Back to talk about it in a moment\\" at the conclusion of each half inning, pitcher change, or other reason for commercial break. *\\"Heeee struck him out!\\" after a meaningful strikeout. *\\"[Player name] would be next\\" when a player is on deck with two outs. *\\"The merry-go-round will be in motion\\" when the bases are loaded, two outs, with a 3-2 count, for the automatic start that the three runners take. *\\"[Player name] going back, to the track, at the wall and... It's outta here!\\" when a player hits a home run. *\\"...and the [team name] are down to their final strike.\\" counting down from last out, last strike at the end of the game. *\\"...and the ball game is OVER!\\" for the ending of the game by describing the final play and finishing it.

He is known for his vivid and succinct description of the game action, his smooth baritone voice, corny joking with former broadcast partner Howie Rose, and his sometimes biting, but always well-informed baseball commentary.

On June 1, 2012, Cohen called the first no-hitter in Mets history, thrown by Johan Santana. On July 31, 2015, two days after shortstop Wilmer Flores was nearly traded to the Brewers for Carlos G√≥mez, Flores hit a dramatic walk-off home run in the 12th inning against the first place Nationals. That game, and home run, were both widely considered to be the turning point of the 2015 season for the Mets as they went on to win their first National League East title since 2006. The Nationals, meanwhile, collapsed and finished in second place, 7 games behind New York. On September 26, 2015, Cohen called the Mets' 10-2 win against the Cincinnati Reds where the Mets clinched the National League East for the first time since 2006. On May 7, 2016, Cohen called Bartolo Col√≥n's first Major League home run to become the oldest player in MLB history to hit his first Major League home run. Col√≥n's previous at-bats with the Mets were extremely entertaining for the fans and announcers alike. He would regularly receive standing ovations from the fans in attendance when his name was announced to bat over the loud speaker. Whenever he swung the bat, he would swing with such force that his batting helmet would often fly off in the process. Finally, 17 days before his 43rd birthday, he hit his 1st Major League home run.  Personal life  He is married to Lynn Cohen, and lives in Connecticut. He has five children.

Ferenc Fricsay (; 9 August 1914 ‚Äì 20 February 1963) was a Hungarian conductor. From 1960 until his death, he was an Austrian citizen. Biography Fricsay was born in Budapest in 1914 and studied music under B√©la Bart√≥k, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Ernst von Dohn√°nyi, and Le√≥ Weiner. With these and other faculty at the Budapest Academy of Music he studied piano, violin, clarinet, trombone, percussion, composition and conducting. Fricsay made his first appearance as a conductor at age 15, substituting for his father at the podium of the Young Musicians Orchestra of Budapest. In 1930, at the age of 16, he succeeded his father as conductor of the Young Musicians Orchestra. On graduating in 1933, Fricsay became repetiteur for the chorus of the Budapest Opera; then, from 1933 to 1943, he was music director of the Szeged Philharmonic Orchestra in the third largest city in Hungary; he also served as director of its military band from 1933. In 1942, he was court- martialed by the government of Mikl√≥s Horthy for wanting to employ Jewish musicians, and for having \\"Jewish blood\\" himself (according to reliable reports, his mother was Jewish). When the Nazis occupied Hungary in 1944, the chief editor of the Szeged daily newspaper warned Fricsay that the Gestapo planned to arrest him; he and his wife, Marta (n√©e Telbisz) and three children Marta, Ferenc and Andras, avoided this fate by going underground in Budapest. In 1945, secret emissaries offered him the co-directorship of the Metropolitan Orchestra of Budapest (later Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra); he also became principal conductor of the Budapest Opera. He conducted opera at the Vienna Volksoper and at the Salzburg Festival in the late 1940s, including world premieres in Salzburg of operas by Gottfried von Einem (\\"Danton's Tod\\" in 1947) and by Frank Martin (\\"Zaubertrank\\" in 1948). The enthusiastic reception of Fricsay's work on this international stage led to his being appointed Chief Conductor of the Berlin RIAS Symphony Orchestra and General Music Director of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, from 1949‚Äì1952, performing then in the Theater des Westens. He made his United Kingdom debut at the 1950 Edinburgh Festival, leading the Glyndebourne Opera in Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro. He made his Buenos Aires debut that year with Carmina Burana. In 1951 he made his debuts in Italy and with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. In 1953 he made his debuts in Paris, Milan, Lucerne, and the US, where he conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He was appointed musical director of the Houston Symphony in 1954, but resigned halfway through the season over \\"disagreements on musical policy.\\" The true reason involved US tax policy. He discovered that under the Internal Revenue Code he would have to declare income earned throughout the world in his US tax return as long as he spent more than 6 months residing in the United States. His contract with the Houston Symphony would have resulted in having his income becoming subject to prohibitive US tax rates. When he became aware of this problem he abruptly left Houston for Switzerland. He made his debut with the Israel Philharmonic in 1954. He spent much of his time from the 1950s onward in Germany as music director of the Bavarian State Opera (1956‚Äì1958) and as conductor of the RIAS Symphony Orchestra, the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Berlin Philharmonic. Also in 1956, he was appointed General Music Director of the Munich Court Opera, a position he held until 1958. Fricsay gave his last concert on 7 December 1961 in London where he conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra in Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. He suffered from repeated illnesses throughout his life and finally succumbed to cancer of the stomach on 20 February 1963 at the age of 48 in Basel, Switzerland. Repertoire and recordings Fricsay was known for his interpretations of the music of Mozart and Beethoven, as well as that of his teachers B√©la Bart√≥k and Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. His 1958 recording of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 is featured in the movie A Clockwork Orange. He conducted without a baton, according to the entry in New Grove, but \\"confounded the adverse critics of this technique by the extreme clarity and precision of his performances,\\" to which it also ascribes \\"a dynamic spirit\\" and \\"vividness of character in familiar classics.\\" From the 1950s until his death, he recorded for the Deutsche Grammophon record label. He led the inauguration of the rebuilt Deutsche Oper Berlin with a performance of Don Giovanni on September 24, 1961. A video of this performance has been issued on DVD.

She played for the Italian national team and for various clubs in women's Serie A. She was the top scorer in Serie A in the 1984‚Äì85 season, and for 11 consecutive years from 1987‚Äì88 to 1997‚Äì98. She is also a registered Lawyer. After retiring as a player, she began a managing career with Lazio. She then managed the Italian women's national team from 2000 to 2005, and the Canadian national women's team from 2009 to 2011. In 2014, she was the first woman to be inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame. Playing career =International= Born in Venice, Morace debuted for the Italian women's national team in 1978, against Yugoslavia, at the age of 14. During her career, she made 153 appearances for Italy, scoring 105 goals. While playing in the Italian national women's league, she scored more than 550 goals. She took part in six European Championships as well as the inaugural FIFA Women's World Cup China 1991, where she scored four goals, including recording the first ever hat-trick to be scored at a World Cup in their 5‚Äì0 win against Chinese Taipei. As a curtain-raiser to the 1990 FA Charity Shield, Italy played the England women's national football team at Wembley Stadium. Morace scored all four goals in England's 4‚Äì1 defeat and was featured on the front page of the following day's La Gazzetta dello Sport, a record that has never been beaten by a male or female player since. Coaching career Morace holds a UEFA PRO License and is probably best known for having been the first woman to coach a professional men's football team, Viterbese of Italian Serie C1, a post she took in June 1999. She eventually resigned from her position after only two matches as the President interfered with management of the technical staff. For 5 years from 2000‚Äì2005, she was head coach for Italian women's national team, qualifying twice for the European Championships. In 2008‚Äì2009 Morace accepted a role as the head coach of a Men's Parliamentary Team preparing them for competition. In February 2009 she was announced as the new head coach of the Canadian national women's team. Under her guidance, Canada won the 2010 CONCACAF, 2010 and 2011 Cyprus Cups and 2010 Four Nations Tournament. At the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup the team's top goal scorer Christine Sinclair broke her nose in the opening match and subsequently the team did not progress to the next round as expected. In the first ever FIFA Physical Analysis at a Women's World Cup, Canada excelled in the distances covered at high speed in comparison to other teams reflecting in their quick tempo, short passing and high pressing game. Unexpectedly, she formally announced her resignation as the coach of the Canadian national women's team on Friday 22 July 2011 due to future budget disputes. Over her 2.5 years in charge Morace improved Canada's FIFA ranking from 11th to 6th position in the World. From 2011 Carolina Morace has been leading and conducting FIFA Coaching Courses around the world as a FIFA Ambassador and Instructor. Her experience as the CEO of Juventus Academy Roma prompted her to begin her own Football Academy, Pro Soccer Coaching. On 17 September 2015 it was announced that Morace had been appointed technical director of a Men's National Premier League Club Floreat Athena FC in Western Australia. In December 2016 she was appointed Head Coach of her third National Team Trinidad and Tobago Women's National Team. In 2017 she and her team terminated the contract because of payment issues and later won their case with Court of Arbitration for Sport and FIFA. In 2018 Morace returned to Italy as she became the first coach of A.C. Milan Women in Serie A finishing third in their inaugural season and the only team to defeat Juventus 3-0. Morace currently is the only female to commentate tactically on the Men's Serie A for Sky Sport in Italy. Personal life Morace gained a law degree in 1996 and practises at a legal studio in Rome. After featuring for 13 years on Italian television, Morace became a celebrity in Italy. Her role as a football commentator and analyst for the Men's Serie A Professional League saw her work across channels La7, Telemontecarlo, Rai 1 and Rai International and write weekly articles for La Gazzetta Dello Sport. In 2015 Morace featured in a comic book as a coach for a Professional Primavera football squad called \\"Elfio e i Satanelli!\\". On 11 October 2020, Morace came out as lesbian, recounting her life in her book Fuori dagli schemi. She married the former Australian footballer Nicola Williams, with whom she celebrated the wedding twice‚Äîfirst in Bristol, on the SS Great Britain, and the second in Australia.

He was elected to seven terms as a U.S. Representative from New Jersey as a Republican. He was later a convicted criminal who served nine months in federal prison for corruption. Early life and career Born as John Parnell Feeney Jr. in Jersey City, New Jersey, he changed his name in 1919 to John Parnell Thomas. Raised Catholic, he later became an Episcopalian. After graduating from high school, he studied at the University of Pennsylvania. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, he served overseas with the United States Army. Following his discharge from the military in 1919, Thomas worked in the investment securities and insurance business in New York City for the next eighteen years. He entered Allendale, New Jersey, municipal politics in 1925 and was elected councilman and then Mayor of Allendale, New Jersey from 1926 to 1930. He was elected to a two-year term to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1935. In 1936 Thomas was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican Party Representative from New Jersey's 7th congressional district, filling the vacancy left by the death of Randolph Perkins. He would be re-elected six times. Anti-communism As a U.S. Congressman, Thomas was a staunch conservative opponent of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, claiming the President's legislative agenda had \\"sabotaged the capitalist system.\\" Thomas opposed government support for the Federal Theatre Project declaring that \\"practically every play presented under the auspices of the Project is sheer propaganda for Communism or the New Deal.\\" In 1949 Thomas called the U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, \\"the most dangerous man in America\\" and claimed that if Forrestal were not removed from office he would \\"cause another world war.\\" Demobilization In the post-war period, Thomas called for a rapid demobilization of the American military. In 1946, he invited General Dwight Eisenhower to his office to discuss the issue. When he arrived, the general was faced with a table surrounded by soldier's wives, many holding babies. News photographers took photos of the furious Eisenhower. HUAC After the Republican Party gained control of the 80th Congress in the November 1946 elections, Thomas was appointed chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC)‚Äìduring that period, also called the \\"Thomas Committee.\\" In May 1947, Thomas traveled to Hollywood to meet with film industry executives with a view to exposing what he believed was Communist infiltration of motion pictures content by members of the Screen Writers Guild. Returning to Washington, D.C., he shifted the focus of the committee to what he called the \\"subversives\\" working in the film business. Under Thomas, in October 1947, HUAC summoned suspected Communists to appear for questioning. These summonses led to the conviction and imprisonment for contempt of Congress of the \\"Hollywood Ten\\" who had refused to answer the Committee's questions, citing the First Amendment. Corruption charges and imprisonment Prominent American columnists Jack Anderson and Drew Pearson were critical of Thomas and his committee's methods. Rumors about corrupt practices on the part of Thomas were confirmed when his secretary, Helen Campbell, sent documents to Pearson which he used to expose Thomas' corruption in an August 4, 1948, newspaper article. The fraud had begun on New Year's Day of 1940, when Thomas placed Campbell's niece, Myra Midkiff, and Campbell's maid, Arnette Minor on his payroll as clerks. Midkiff earned roughly $1,200 a year and was to kick back her entire salary to the Congressman. Through this practice, he would also evade a tax bracket increase. The arrangement lasted for four years. As a result, Thomas and Campbell were summoned to answer to charges of salary fraud before a grand jury.http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%2010/Yonkers%20NY%20Herald%20Statesman/Yonkers%20NY%20Herald%20Statesman%201949%20Grayscale/Yonkers%20NY%20Herald%20Statesman%201949%20Grayscale%20-%204088.pdf Thomas refused to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment rights, the most common stance for which he had criticized accused Communists. Indicted, Thomas was tried and convicted of fraud, fined and given an 18-month prison sentence. He resigned from Congress on January 2, 1950. In an ironic twist, he was imprisoned in Danbury Prison where Lester Cole and Ring Lardner Jr., both members of the \\"Hollywood Ten\\" were serving time because of Thomas' inquiries into the film industry. Post-prison After his release from prison, Thomas was an editor and publisher of three weekly newspapers in Bergen County, New Jersey. President Harry S. Truman pardoned Thomas on Christmas Eve of 1952. In 1954, Thomas tried to re-enter politics, but was defeated for the Republican Party nomination for Congress. Death Thomas died in 1970 in St. Petersburg, Florida, aged 75, of undisclosed causes. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the Elmgrove Cemetery in Mystic, Connecticut. Depictions In the 2015 film Trumbo, Thomas is portrayed by James Dumont.

Common names for this fish include salamanderfish and Shannon mudminnow. Although it is not a lungfish, it resembles lungfish in several respects, including its ability to survive dry seasons by burrowing into the sand. It is on the IUCN Red List as Endangered. Morphology Lepidogalaxias salamandroides is small with females measuring up to 7 cm in length. This species has a slender, elongate and cylindrical body. The colour is brownish- green on the upper parts, silver-speckled and blotched on the sides, very pale below, and the fin membranes are transparent. The reddish eyes are fixed, but the fish is able to move its neck in any direction. Biology The salamaderfish spawn in winter when water levels are highest. Females produce 100‚Äì400 eggs with a diameter of 1.1‚Äì1.3mm, which hatch into bottom-feeder larvae 5.5mm long. Larvae and juveniles grow rapidly to gain fat stores to survive the summer drought period. Individuals reach up to 5 years of age. The salamanderfish is carnivorous, mainly feeding on aquatic insect larvae. Range and habitat It has a limited distribution in acidic pools of water in heathland peat flats of southwest Australia, between the Blackwood and Kent Rivers. This range is across a distance of 180 kilometres, in an area of Northcliffe, they are common in this region. Its habitat is semi-permanent water, small pools and streams that may be high in tannins and acidity (pH 3.0‚Äì6.5). They experience a range of water temperatures, daily changes of 16 to 32 degrees Celsius, in pools no deeper than 0.1 metres. The species rests on the bottom of the water using elongated pelvic and rounded caudal fins. These small and shallow pools may contain a population of around 150 individuals, are generally no larger than 600 square metres, and evaporate in the dry seasons. It is also unusual for its ability to survive desiccation by burrowing into sand, a process of aestivation, when the pools it lives in periodically evaporate. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1961 by Gerlof Fokko Mees.Mees, G. F. 1961. Description of a new fish of the family Galaxiidae from Western Australia. J. Roy. Soc. West. Aust. 44: 33‚Äì38. This author identified the species as belonging to the Galaxiidae, but the relationship to those species was in doubt. Lepidogalaxias salamandroides was eventually placed among the Osmeriformes as a monotypic arrangement, Lepidogalaxias (Lepidogalaxiidae), in 1991. This placement has been also challenged, but remains current. The species is contained in the class Actinopterygii, ray-finned fish, and is sometimes given the taxonomic placements as Galaxiidae of the order Salmoniformes. It is sometimes named as the mud minnow, long-finned Galaxias, scaled galaxias, or dwarf pencilfish, however mud minnow usually refers to Galaxiella munda. A further list of names refer to L. salamandroides as salamanderfish of Western Australia, West Australian salamanderfish, salamander fish, salmanderfish, and Shannon mudminnow.

Newlands also founded the neighborhoods of Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C.; and Chevy Chase, Maryland. Early life Newlands was born in Natchez, Mississippi, on August 28, 1846 (or 1848; sources differ). He was the fourth of five children born to Jessie and James Newlands, immigrants from Scotland. His father, trained as a physician in Edinburgh, died in 1851. Newlands was raised in Illinois and Washington, D.C. In 1867, he went to Yale University. In 1869, he graduated from Columbian College, which is now George Washington University Law School, and was admitted to the bar in 1869.Atwood, Albert W. Francis G. Newlands: A Builder of the Nation. 1969 In 1901, he received an honorary M.A. degree. Career In 1870, Newlands moved to San Francisco, California. He married Clara Adelaide Sharon, the daughter of future Nevada senator William Sharon, in 1874. They had three daughters. Newlands helped William Sharon to reopen the Bank of California, and supervised the management of the Palace Hotel, San Francisco. When Newlands‚Äô wife died, he inherited the Sharon estate. Newlands married Edith McAllister and moved to Nevada in 1888.Daily Alta California, Volume 42, Number 14249, 9 September 1888 =Land developer= In the late 1880s, Newlands and his partners began to acquire farmland in northwestern Washington, D.C., and southern Montgomery County, Maryland, in order to develop a residential streetcar suburb for the nation's capital. On June 23, 1888, Newlands chartered the Rock Creek Railway for a single-track streetcar. Two years later, Newlands and his partners purchased more than 1,700 acres and formed the Chevy Chase Land Company. Between 1890 and 1892, the Land Company built two bridges, constructed five miles of road, and laid streetcar tracks along the road. The Rock Creek Railway opened in 1892. To supply the electricity to the streetcars, the company dammed Coquelin Run, a small tributary of Rock Creek, just east of Connecticut Avenue; the resulting Chevy Chase Lake supplied water for an electric generating plant. From 1894 to 1936, the Land Company operated an amusement park on the lake as a means to draw prospective buyers to the development and to keep the streetcars supplied with evening and weekend passengers. Newlands created the Chevy Chase Springs Hotel (later the Chevy Chase School for Girls, now the 4-H Youth Conference Center). Newlands ensured the community included schools, churches, country clubs, tree-lined streets, a water supply and a sewage system. Groceries and daily purchases were brought from Washington, D.C., on the railway at no charge to residents. In 1893, Newlands began to subdivide some property he inherited in Burlingame, California. He started with the Burlingame Country Club and five cottages. The following year, he added the Burlingame train station. =U.S. Representative= Newlands represented Nevada in the United States House of Representatives from 1893 to 1903 as a member of the Silver Party. In 1898, he created the Newlands Resolution, which annexed the Republic of Hawaii, creating a new territory. He supported a greater federal role in conservation and pushed for federal funding of western arid land irrigation projects. He helped pass the Reclamation Act of 1902, also called the Newlands Act, which created what would become the Bureau of Reclamation. =U.S. Senator= Newlands as a US Senator, c. 1914 Newlands entered the United States Senate in 1903 as a Democrat. He supported the protection of the National Forests under the United States Forest Service in 1905, and the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. He was a member of the Senate subcommittee that investigated the 1912 sinking of .Titanic Inquiry Project In 1916, he was the only Democratic senator to vote against the nomination of Louis Brandeis to the U.S. Supreme Court.Confirm Brandeis by Vote of 47 to 22, The New York Times, June 2, 1916 Newlands held white supremacist beliefs and spoke publicly in favor of restricting the rights of African-Americans.Fisher, Marc. \\"Chevy Chase, 1916: For Everyman, a New Lot in Life,\\" Washington Post, February 15, 1999 This pamphlet, consisting mostly of a transcript of a speech by Gary, includes an extract of a statement given by Newlands on February 7, 1909, to the Washington Post that includes the \\"race of children\\" assertion. He served until his death in Washington, D.C., on December 24, 1917. He died of heart failure in his home. Legacy The Francis Griffith Newlands Memorial Fountain is in Chevy Chase Circle, a federal park that divides D.C. and Maryland. In 2014, a member of the Chevy Chase advisory neighborhood commission proposed a resolution calling for the removal of Newlands‚Äô name from the fountain because of his white supremacist views on race, including his desire to remove the vote for African-Americans. Others believe that Chevy Chase should not alter the monument because the change would belittle Newlands' legislative accomplishments. Newlands' former mansion in Reno is one of six properties in Nevada designated as a National Historic Landmark. Many notable people, including Barbara Hutton in 1935, stayed at the house while waiting for their divorce paperwork to be finalized by George Thatcher, a local divorce lawyer who purchased the home in 1920.

Western television series Bronco. Early life Hardin was born in New York City, but reared in Texas, after his family moved to the capital city of Austin when he was six months old. His father, an acoustical engineer, left the family four years later. As a growing boy, his grandmother, with whom he lived part of the time after his parents divorced, nicknamed him \\"Ty\\" because he was as active as a \\"Texas typhoon\\". Hardin graduated in 1949 from Lamar High School in Houston. A football scholarship enabled him to attend Blinn College in Brenham, Texas for one year, and then he went to the Dallas Bible Institute for one semester. He served in the United States Army during the Korean War. He was commissioned after attending Officer Candidate School in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and he became a pilot of Forward Observer O-1 Bird Dog liaison aircraft. He attained the rank of first lieutenant. After his return from service, he began taking courses at Texas A&M; University in College Station on a scholarship under Coach Bear Bryant, for whom he played tight end. Acting career =Paramount ‚Äì \\"Ty Hungerford\\"= A Paramount Pictures talent scout discovered Hardin while Hardin attended a costume party. He had rented revolvers from a motion picture costume rental company. By 1957, Hardin acquired the services of agent Henry Willson and made his way to Hollywood, where he was put under contract by Paramount Pictures. Initially billed as \\"Ty Hungerford\\", he made various minor appearances in several Paramount films, such as The Space Children (1958), As Young as We Are (1958) I Married a Monster from Outer Space (1958), The Buccaneer (1958) and Last Train from Gun Hill (1959). =Warner Bros. years ‚Äì Bronco= Hardin with Yvette Dugay Hardin tried to obtain a support role in the 1959 film Rio Bravo that had been promised to singer Ricky Nelson. John Wayne reportedly saw Hardin while visiting a film set at Paramount and was impressed with Hardin's appearance. Wayne introduced him to Howard Hawks and William T. Orr at Warner Bros. Television; they bargained for his seven-year contract and he moved to Warner Bros., who changed his stage surname to \\"Hardin\\", reminiscent of the Texas gunfighter John Wesley Hardin. He attended actors' school at Warner Bros. and landed small parts in various Warner productions. When Clint Walker walked out on his ABC series Cheyenne in 1958 during a contract dispute with Warner Bros., Hardin got his big break. Warner bought out Hardin's contract from Paramount Studios and installed him into Cheyenne for the remainder of the season, as the country cousin \\"Bronco Layne\\". Walker and Warner Bros. came to terms after the season ended, but Hardin had made such a big hit on the show that Jack L. Warner gave him his own series, Bronco, under the Cheyenne title. Bronco alternated weeks with Sugarfoot, starring Will Hutchins, and Cheyenne for four years. The series ran from 1958 to 1962. Hardin guest starred on other Warners shows such as Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip. Warners cast Hardin in some films such as Merrill's Marauders (1962), where he was second billed to Jeff Chandler; The Chapman Report (1962); the spring break film Palm Springs Weekend (1963); PT 109; and Wall of Noise (1963). =International films= When his contract expired, Hardin did Guys and Dolls in stock. He then left Hollywood to seek opportunity overseas as his series aired all over the world. Like many other American actors, Hardin traveled to Europe, where he made several spaghetti Westerns, including Man of the Cursed Valley (1964). He appeared in the war film Battle of the Bulge (1965) shot in Spain, and the Western Savage Pampas (1966). He had the lead in Death on the Run (1967). He was reportedly the first choice to play the starring role in the television series Batman, which went instead to Adam West. Hardin turned down Batman because of film commitments overseas. Was offered the lead by Sergio Leone in A Fistful of Dollars but turned it down. He supported Joan Crawford in Berserk! (1967) and played Captain Reno in Custer of the West (1967) shot in Spain. He had the lead in Ragan (1968) and One Step to Hell (1968). =Riptide= Hardin starred in the 1968‚Äì1969 Australian television series Riptide, in which he played an American running a charter boat company along the eastern seaboard of Australia. He returned to Europe to star in The Last Rampage (1970), Quel maledetto giorno della resa dei conti (1971), and Drummer of Vengeance (1971). He was in a 1970 German television series called On the Trail of Johnny Hilling, Boor and Billy, shown in the former West Germany. Hadin was in The Last Rebel (1971) Acquasanta Joe (1971), and You're Jinxed, Friend You've Met Sacramento (1972) and a small role in Avanti! (1972). In 1974 he was arrested in Spain for drug trafficking and spent time in prison. =Later career= Hardin's later appearances included Rooster: Spurs of Death! (1977), Fire (1977), and Image of the Beast (1980) as well as episodes of TV shows such as The Love Boat. He was in The Zoo Gang (1985) and Red River (1988) and had a late lead in Born Killer (1989). Hardin could be seen in Bad Jim (1992), and Rescue Me (1992). Personal life John Beradino, Hardin, and Anne Helm in 1961 In 1958, Hardin had his name changed legally from Orison Whipple Hungerford Jr. to Ty Hardin. He ascribed the change to a matter of convenience. From 1962 to 1966, he was married to the 1961 Miss Universe, German beauty queen Marlene Schmidt, who later worked in the movie industry; they had one daughter. At the time of his death, Hardin lived with his eighth wife, Caroline, in Huntington Beach, California. Hardin died on August 3, 2017, aged 87. Arizona Patriots After difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service, Hardin founded an anti-tax movement in Prescott, Arizona. In 1982, the movement became known as the Arizona Patriots. The anti- Semitic group first gained public notice by its efforts to clog the Arizona court system with nuisance lawsuits in the 1980s, a tactic also employed by the violence-prone Posse Comitatus. The Patriots evolved from its anti-tax origins into a group described by the government and militia tracking groups as anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant and anti-black with a record of stockpiling weapons and threatening to assassinate Arizona state officials.https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/08/07/ty-hardin-star-tv- western-bronco-dies-87/546229001/ It eventually disappeared after being infiltrated by the FBI, and federal agents raided one of its camps in 1986. Three men (James Ellison, Kerrey Noble and William Thomas) were sentenced to prison, others to lesser sentences, and one remains a fugitive. Hardin eventually left Arizona for California.

Established in 1834, it is one of the oldest colleges of the University of Mumbai. Alumni include B. R. Ambedkar, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Virchand Gandhi, Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Nanabhai Haridas, Kashinath Trimbak Telang and Jamsetji Tata and teachers include Dadabhai Naoroji. It has played a key role in the spread of Western education in Mumbai. 2006 marked the sesquicentennial celebrations of the college (1856‚Äì2006). It offers undergraduate level courses in the arts, sciences and commerce and is under the governance of the Maharashtra Government.  History  Mountstuart Elphinstone Elphinstone College in the late 19th century By the 19th century Mumbai was a prosperous centre for maritime trade and commerce. In 1824 an English school was set up by the Bombay Native Education Society for Indian students. In 1827 a resolution was passed that an institution for promotion of education should be established under Bombay Native Education Society and be designated as \\"Elphinstone College\\" (distinct from High School). This is after Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone, the departing governor of Bombay who was responsible for beginning higher education in the city. Rs.2,29,636.00 was collected by public subscription to fund teaching professorships in the English language and the Arts, Science and Literature of Europe. The professorships were in honour of Mountstaurt Elphinstone. The college was formally constituted in 1835. The classes commenced in 1836, at Town Hall, with the first two professors: Arthur Bedford Orlebar (Natural Philosophy - i.e. Science) and John Harkness (General Literature). In 1840, the professors' classes were amalgamated with the Society's High School to form the Elphinstone Native Education Institution. In 1845, the name was shortened to Elphinstone Institution. Elphinstone College became a distinct institution, separated from the high school, on 1 April 1856. This year is officially considered to be the year of the establishment of Elphinstone College. The college was affiliated to the University of Mumbai in 1860. In 1871, Elphinstone College got it own building in Byculla. James Trubshawe, an architect who flourished in the early part of the 19th century, designed the structure, which was built by the engineer, John Adams. This older Elphinstone College building stands opposite the Jijamata Udyaan in Byculla, Mumbai. It is now a hospital, and a second Elphinstone College across the Jehangir Art Gallery was built a decade later. =Role in inception of University Of Mumbai and other colleges= The University Of Mumbai was established in 1857. Inception classes were held at Elphinstone College and were subsequently moved to the present Fort campus. To formalise legal education, a chair of Jurisprudence, the Perry Professorship, was set up at Elphinstone Institution in 1855. The same year, R. T. Reid (LL. B. Bar-at-Law) was appointed the first Perry Professor of Jurisprudence and the Government Law School as it was then called. This is taken as the inception of the Government Law College Mumbai. It was suggested that Elphinstone College premises be used (during morning hours) for initial classes of Jai Hind College. The proposal was accepted and admission started for the Arts Faculty in June 1948, with a formal inauguration in September 1948 at the Elphinstone College Library Hall. The Sir J. J. School of Arts was founded in 1857 and was instituted to offer drawing classes. Initial classes were held at Elphinstone Institution.  Academics  Elphinstone college Elphinstone College Mumbai Elphinstone College, c. 1905 Elphinstone College, like many other colleges of Mumbai, constitutes two academic entities: Senior and Junior colleges.

During British rule, it was most coveted among colleges, standing alongside Presidency Colleges of Calcutta and Madras. However, post independence its standards declined and more so in the recent times. This is generally attributed to government negligence and red tapism. The college was an important center of radical left sympathies during the 1970s decade: and produced leaders for this movement. = Heritage College building = The college building, with its Gothic architecture, has been classified as a grade 1 heritage structure. It is one of the most identified buildings of South Mumbai as a symbol British Raj heritage. Locally, the college is famous for its Romanesque Transitional style building that has been categorized as Grade I Heritage structure. The building was designed by Trubshaw, supervised by Khan Bahadur Muncherjee Murzban, and completed in 1888.

Members of this genus are often called trichinella or trichina worms. A characteristic of Nematoda is the one-way digestive tract, with a pseudocoelom (body cavity made up of only an ectoderm and endoderm). The genus was first recognised in a larval form in 1835. The L1 larvae live in a modified skeletal muscle cell. The adult worms occupy a membrane-bound portion of columnar epithelium, living as intramulticellular parasites of animals, including humans. Infections with this genus have been reported from more than 150 different naturally or experimentally infected hosts. It has been shown to have a worldwide distribution in domestic and/or sylvatic animals. Trichinella is the smallest human nematode parasite, yet it is also the largest of all intracellular parasites. Oral ingestion of larvae-contaminated tissue is the usual route of infection, but congenital and mammary transmission can occur in rats. Phylogenetics Eight species are currently recognized. Four additional genotypes require adequate description before they can be recognized as valid species. Two main clades are recognized in the genus: one group (T. britovi, T. murrelli, T. nativa, T. nelsoni, T. spiralis) that encapsulates in host muscle tissue and a second (T. papuae, T. pseudospiralis, T. zimbabwensis) that does not. The nonencapsulated group infects saurians, crocodilians, and other nonavian archosaurs (T. papuae, T. zimbabwensis) and birds (T. pseudospiralis). The encapsulated group infects synapsid and mammalian hosts. T. spiralis and T. nelsoni appear to be basal in the encapsulated group and T. murrelli and T. nativa the most recently evolved. Prevalence in animals and humans A microscope for Trichinella detection (from 1847). Trichinella species can infect swine, wild animals (foxes, wolves, bears, skunk, raccoons, rats, and other small mammals), and humans. In swine, the prevalence varies from country to country, and regionally. Long-standing meat inspection programs in some European countries have drastically lowered prevalence rates among domestic swine. Domestic swine can be exposed to the parasite by: * Feeding of animal waste products or other feed contaminated with Trichinella * Exposure to infected rodents or other infected wildlife * Cannibalism within an infected herd In wild animals, Trichinella infection rates vary from region to region and seem to increase in colder climates. Foxes, wolves, and bears have the highest infection rates, but small mammals, such as skunks, raccoons, and rats, provide the highest risk to infecting the domestic pig. In horses, natural infections are rare; however, horses from Mexico and Romania have been found to be infected. Human infection caused by the domestic pig varies from country to country. While some countries do not report any human infection, other countries in Eastern Europe and Asia report hundreds or thousands of cases annually. The United States reported 25 cases per year from 1991 to 1996, with few implicating raw or undercooked pork. Documented sources of human infection have also included game meats, such as wild boar, bear, walrus, fox, and cougar. From 1997 to 2001 meats other than pork were the most common source of infection, with more cases associated with home-raised pork than commercial. The decreased incidence of trichinellosis in the United States has resulted from changes in pork industry management standards and government regulations. In Finland, meat inspection revealed a small but worrisome number of swine infections in the early 1980s, peaking in 1996. However, due to the swine industry's modernization process, the number of cases decreased, with the last infected swine diagnosed in 2004. As of 2010 only eight known human infections had been reported in Finland since the 1800s, with the last one more than three decades before. A study of the sera from 197 wild boars from 25 farms slaughtered in Finland between 2007 and 2008 found four (2.0%) of the sera, originating from three (12.0%) farms, to be Trichinella-seropositive. Trichinosis is often diagnosed in humans once the larvae invade the muscle tissue. Some symptoms include fever, myalgia, malaise, and edema. Trichinosis treatment focuses on reducing inflammation, and corticosteroids are usually administered. This treatment often leads to complete recovery, but muscle pain and weakness may persist. Knowledge on the epidemiology, host range and transmission of Trichinella species occurring in wildlife in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. However, hypothetical transmission cycles have been proposed for Trichinella zimbabwensis, Trichinella T8 and Trichinella nelsoni; these cycles consider the role of Lions and Spotted Hyenas as apex predators. = Detection = Artificial digestion is used to detect the presence of encysted trichinella larvae in suspected muscle tissue. The meat sample is dissolved by a digestive solution and the remains are examined for the presence of larvae. = Treatment = Treatment is by either thiabendazole or mebendazole. = Prevention = Trichinella infection can be prevented by cooking pork meat properly, or by freezing pork. However, freezing pork is not an effective method for killing larvae. One way to prevent trichinellosis is to cook meat to a safe temperature (at least 145 ¬∞F, 63 ¬∞C internal temperature as measured by a food thermometer, followed by a three-minute rest for fresh pork). The meat is not safe until cooking is completed. To help prevent Trichinella infection in animal populations, pigs or wild animals should be prevented from eating uncooked meat, scraps, or carcasses of any animals, including rats, which may be infected with Trichinella, in order to break the oral ingestion cycle of infection.

Both are created using Adobe Photoshop or a similar application with the pen tool although the vector is made using the shape layer function of the pen tool whereas the vexel is based on raster layers. Vexel is a neologism for an entirely pixel-based form of raster art that imitates the visual appearance of vector graphics technique (i.e. sharp-edged lines and areas of flat colour or smooth gradient fills). The word itself is a portmanteau derived from a combination of \\"vector\\" and \\"pixel.\\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/03/50-beautiful-examples-of- vexel-artworks-and-tutorials/  Technique  There is no one defined way to create a vexel,News: Vexed over VexelsSeth Woolley's Blog - Occasional Musings however, one archetypal way to create a vexelPhotoshop, Illustrator, Vector Art and Vexel Tutorials - Vexels.net - Vexel and Vector Art Community follows. Instead of using vector-based lines, shapes, and polygons to create an image, a vexel is typically created using a raster program's support for transparent layers. Each transparent layer is given a solid (or sometimes gradientSeth Woolley's Blog - Occasional Musings) shape and a display ordering that when displayed together with other near shape layers appears to create a stepped- but-gradual color transition. In some cases, for more realism, gradients are used that remove the stepping in the color transitions to create a smoother, photo-realistic image. The different nature of raster programs over a vector- plotted approach gives some vexel images a unique appearance when compared with traditional rasterized vector graphics. However, the increased flexibility comes with a loss of image scalability for print media, which vector artwork retains. To compensate for this, most vexels are created at very high resolution. A vexel may even be composed using vector graphic techniques, however it becomes a vexel when the vector elements are rasterized and further manipulations to the image are done in raster. Sometimes true raster images are placed behind and/or in front of the original vector elements to emphasize the surrealism that the vector elements produce. A vexel is not essentially created with paintbrushes, airbrushes or a freehand tool such as pencil, although some may include these elements if they are not the primary medium. Ben Woolley says \\"[V]exels were originally meant to involve a vector technique, not any particular aesthetic style.\\"  Style and appearance  Vexels are commonly used to portray a sharpened look of a realistic object, such as a vehicle. Vexels are often characterized by crisp, clean color and lines (that look nearly vector-graphics style) but is entirely pixel-based, with a variety of color levels, from 2-color outlines to pseudo-realism.  Etymology  The term vexel was created by Seth Woolley while he was a technical contributor to the now defunct but once popular teen message board Nova Boards to give it a distinctive name from traditional vector graphics. Seth didn't approve of calling the raster images that looked like vectors the name of \\"vector\\". In response to a question of what they would be called, he coined the term \\"vexel\\" as a combination of vector and pixel since they were not simply rasters, and those asking needed a name for a new style. He at first suggested calling them rasterized or posterized vector images, but the community took the word \\"vexel\\" as an acceptable neologism. Ben Woolley has described its derivation.

Sessai aided his nephew in consolidating the Imagawa territories, and in a number of political maneuvers which gained Imagawa influence over the Matsudaira family. By 1548 he had secured a young Tokugawa Ieyasu (a member of the Matsudaira family) as a hostage. However, Yoshimoto soon came into conflict with the Oda clan, and faced defeat at the 1542 battle of Azukizaka. After this, he left Sessai in command of his armies. In 1545, Imagawa secured a treaty and alliance between his family and those of the H≈çj≈ç and Takeda Shingen. At some point after this, Sessai began to advise Tokugawa Ieyasu, though the extent of his role in Tokugawa's military exploits is unclear, and unlikely to be great.

The largest rainbowfish genus, Melanotaenia, derives from the ancient Greek melano (black) and taenia (banded). Translated, it means \\"black-banded\\", and is a reference to the often striking lateral black bands that run along the bodies of those in the genus Melanotaenia. Characteristics The Melanotaeniidae is characterised by having their distal premaxillary teeth enlarged. They have a compressed body with the two dorsal fins being separated but with only a small gap between them. There are 3-7 spines in the first dorsal fin while the second has 6-22 rays, with the first ray being a stout spine in some species, the anal fin has 10-30 rays and, again, the first may be a stout spine in some species. The lateral line is either weakly developed or absent. They have comparatively large scales and these number 28-60 in the lateral series. The pelvic fins are attached to the fish‚Äôs abdomen by a membrane which runs along the length of the innermost ray and this is a feature which can be used to separate rainbowfishes from silversides, although the membrane is easily torn. The majority of the species in this family demonstrate sexual dimorphism with the males usually being the more colourful sex and also showing an elongated median fin ray. Most species of rainbowfish are less than in length, with some species measuring less than , while one species, Melanotaenia vanheurni, reaches lengths of up to . They live in a wide range of freshwater habitats, including rivers, lakes, and swamps. Although they spawn all year round, they lay a particularly large number of eggs at the start of the local rainy season. The eggs are attached to aquatic vegetation, and hatch seven to 18 days later. Rainbowfish are omnivorous, feeding on small crustaceans, insect larvae, and algae. Rainbowfish are popular aquarium fish along with Pseudomugil blue-eyes, which are another small, colourful fish found in a similar range and habitats. In the wild, some rainbowfish populations have been severely affected by the aggressive introduced eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), tilapia cichlids, and pollution. Bedotia sp a Madagascar rainbowfish Classification Melanotaeniidae is divided into a number of subfamilies, these families have been considered by some authorities to separate families but the 5th Edition of Fishes of the World classifies these as subfamilies of a single family as they form a monophyletic group or clade. They are therefore classified as follows: * Subfamily Bedotiinae Jordan & Hubbs, 1919 Madagascar rainbowfishes ** Genus Bedotia Regan, 1903 ** Genus Rheocles Jordan & Hubbs, 1919 * Subfamily Melanotaeniinae Gill, 1894 Rainbowfishes ** Genus Chilatherina Regan, 1914 ** Genus Glossolepis M.

However, two males may sometimes fight at breeding season if there are not enough females. Rainbowfish usually eat floating flakes in captivity, because in the wild they will often eat insects floating on the surface.

It was founded by Steve Stavro, and operated from 1951 to 2001. Community grocery stores Stavro's father operated Louis Meat Market in Toronto from the 1930s to the 1950s. By 1954, Stavro had gone off on his own, managing outdoor markets and grocery stores under the Knob Hill Farms name. By the late 1950s, he was operating at nine sites in Toronto. Food terminals Promotional Knob Hill Farms / Canada Dry pin Knob Hill Farms mug In 1963, Stavro changed direction and opened his first \\"food terminal\\"‚Äîa forerunner of the big-box store with 65,000 square feet (6,000 square-metres) of space just north of Toronto at Woodbine Avenue and Highway 7 in Markham. Knob Hill Farms shopping basket In 1971, Knob Hill Farms expanded into Pickering with its second terminal. A third location ‚Äî the first within Toronto, at Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street West on the site previously occupied by a National Cash Register (NCR) plant ‚Äî followed in 1975. A second Toronto terminal opened in 1977 at Cherry Street and the Gardiner Expressway. The fifth store, billed as the largest food store in North America, opened in 1978 at Dixie Road and the Queen Elizabeth Way in Mississauga. This was the first store in the chain to sell some non-food products and was initially two storeys tall. The second storey was later closed to customers and used for storage. A restaurant, drug store, and wine shop all rented space within the building. In 1981, the opened a location in Oshawa, Ontario in the structure of the Ontario Malleable Iron Company Limited's factory. The building had been used as an iron foundry since 1898, although the company had operated at that site since 1872. The 226,000 square foot (21,000 square-metre) store opened in June 1983. It had spurs for both Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway lines running right to the store. A pharmacy, bakery (RH Bakery‚Äîthe RH stood for Richmond Hill), dentist's office, video rental store, as well as a wine store (Wine Rack), and a card shop were among the other businesses initially located within the terminal. The Ontario Municipal Board and the Ontario government approved a site in 1982 for the seventh Knob Hill Farms terminal, this one at Weston Road and Highway 401 in the Weston community of Toronto. The 325,000 square foot (7.45 acres, or 30,200 square-metre) store opened in the fall of 1985. Knob Hill Farms logo The company proposed to convert an abandoned Canadian General Electric plant in Scarborough, Ontario into a store, but Scarborough City Council voted against the project in 1985 and that decision was upheld by the Ontario Municipal Board in 1987. The older, red, version of the shopping basket In 1988, the Ontario Labor Relations Board found that Knob Hill Farms had acted improperly two years earlier when it fired 14 employees who were trying to organize workers in Oshawa under the United Food and Commercial Workers union. The Oshawa store became the first in the Knob Hill Farms chain to be unionized. The same year, construction began on a terminal in Cambridge, Ontario, the first outside the Greater Toronto Area. Construction was delayed repeatedly, resulting in penalties of about $2.4 million paid to the City of Cambridge. The 31,500 square-metre store finally opened in August 1991. The store began laying off workers less than two months after it opened. In 1999, the company proposed redeveloping the site into a convention centre. The 10,000 square-metre, two-storey Riverdale food terminal at Carlaw Avenue and Gerrard Street in Toronto opened in 1992 and was the company's ninth location. A wholesale warehouse opened in Scarborough the following year. In the 90's Knob Hill Farms was easily recognized in local newspapers with their one or two page ads printed in black and blue. Advertised on the air they used the jingle \\"You know you get good value when you shop, at Knob Hill Farms.\\" Weston store The store in Weston was considered the largest supermarket in the Greater Toronto Area for 15 years. The site was an industrial building dating back to the 1930s which was used for the construction and assembly of airplanes (de Havilland Mosquito) by Massey Harris during World War II. Features around the supermarket included a man-made waterfall with three structures to the northwest side which stopped running after its closing. This was featured at the end of its commercials. The area was about 250 to 300m (800 to 1,000 ft) from south to north and about 50 m (150 ft) from west to east, with an extra 50 m to the northern part featuring parking lots and another 50 m with shipping sectors. The south side featured several shops, rides and a photo shop near the west exit. A mural by artist John Richmond and a team of assistants depicted a history of food, from Prometheus stealing fire for cooking to Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau eating in space. Another mural facing the south side featuring Southern Ontario from downtown Toronto, with a street written as \\"Baloor\\" instead of Bloor Street and the Don Valley Parkway, the western suburbs, the Hamilton Mountain, Niagara Falls and near Fort Erie. The supermarket also featured two doorways in the east and the west sides. The walkway featured streetlights that looked liked a promenade or a walkway. Closure In August 2000, Stavro announced that all stores would close. At the time, the company had about 800 employees at 10 locations. Knob Hill Farms had lost market share to new competitors, including Costco and large Loblaws stores, and had racked up significant debts. The final store ‚Äî the Weston site ‚Äî closed in February 2001. The Markham site was sold for $11.5 million to Michael-Angelo's Market Place Incorporated (supermarket closed and now LA Fitness). Loblaw Companies paid $34.2 million for three properties (Lansdowne & Dundas, Mississauga, and Carlaw & Gerrard) and reopened as No Frills stores. It subsequently purchased the Weston site, demolished the Knob Hill site and redeveloped as a Real Canadian Superstore, which opened in 2006. The Cambridge site is now occupied by Home Depot and Canadian Tire. The site in Scarborough became a Wal-Mart Supercentre. The Pickering store at 1630 Kingston Road was occupied by DOT Patio and T-Phat Supermarket, but now lays abandoned as building was demolished. The Cherry Street site became a T & T Supermarket in 2007 and now part of Loblaws chain but Has since been torn down. The Knob Hill Farms building, at 500 Howard Street in Oshawa, became a discount/liquidation outlet and a flea market for a brief period of time before finally closing its doors and sealing off the property. In July 2014, the Oshawa location was expropriated for the new Oshawa Central GO Station.http://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/4725781-oshawa-knob-hill-farms- property-expropriated-for-new-go-station/ See also *List of Canadian supermarkets *Knob Hill Stable References Category:Companies based in Toronto Category:Retail companies established in 1951 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2001 Category:Defunct supermarkets of Canada Category:1951 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Knob Hill Farms"},{"id":"2190589","text":"Poecilanthrax willistoni, Williston's bee fly or sand dune bee fly, is a member of the Bombyliidae insect family. This family includes the bee flies, true flies that have developed Batesian mimicry characteristics to avoid predators. That is, they look like bees because that helps them avoid bee-wary predators, but they lack stingers. P. willistoni also has larvae that act as parasitoids on other insect species. They drop their eggs strategically so that when the larvae emerge they can easily locate and consume grubs and caterpillars. The bee fly sometimes propels its eggs into holes where beetles live, and when the bee fly's eggs hatch, the larvae attack and eat the beetles' offspring. This species of bee fly lives on sand dunes, and so parasitizes sand dune insect species. This species at a glance resembles a bee, fumbling flowers for nectar and sporting alternating orange and black bars down its abdomen. Unlike a bee, however, it has large red eyes and long, swept-back wings that it holds out from its body. Distribution In Canada, it is found in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; in the United States, it occurs in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming; in Mexico, it is only found in Baja California.

The term nurse cell is used in several unrelated ways in different scientific fields. Human physiology Nurse cells are specialized macrophages residing in the bone marrow that assist in the development of red blood cells. They absorb the nuclei of immature red blood cells and may provide growth factors to help the red blood cells mature. In the bone marrow, immature red blood cells (erythroblasts) can be seen grouped in a cluster around a nurse cell. The epithelial cell found in the cortex of the Thymus is also called a \\"nurse cell.\\" These cells produce Thymic hormones that cause T Lymphocytes to mature and differentiate.McKinley and O'Loughlin (2008) Human Anatomy. McGraw Hill, Boston MA Parasitology In parasitology, a nurse cell is an infected cell in the disease trichinosis discovered by Dickson Despommier. A trichinella larva enters a cell and develops there, probably as a way of concealing itself from the immune system. The parasite has evolved a way of stimulating blood vessel development around the cell, in order to receive the nutrients it needs. In trichinosis, nurse cells are invariably skeletal muscle cells; these are the only type of cell that can support the parasite. Mycology In mycology, a nurse cell is any hyphae that supplies food material to spores that have detached from the basidia; used especially in reference to taxa from the family Sclerodermataceae. Cell biology Ribonucleoprotein particles (GFP-Imp) in the Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber, being transported from the nurse cells to the oocyte In respect to invertebrates, nurse cells are polytenic germline cells that contribute to the development of the oocyte, producing multiple nuclei. In fruit flies (Drosophila), nurse cells surround the developing oocyte and synthesize proteins and RNAs that are to be deposited in it. Nurse cells are highly polyploid (up to 8000C). They dump their cytoplasm containing RNAs and proteins into the oocyte via ring canals. Due to their high metabolic activity, nurse cells likely experience the DNA damaging effect of oxidative free radicals produced as a byproduct of this metabolism. This damaging effect would otherwise befall the DNA of the egg cells if they were responsible for their own synthesis. The many genome copies in each nurse cell may provide redundancy of genetic information that would allow the nurse cell to carry out its provisioning function even in the face of considerable oxidative DNA damage.Bernstein C (1993).

It was written by W. W. Fosdick (lyrics) and George R. Poulton (music). The melody was used in Elvis Presley's 1956 hit song \\"Love Me Tender\\". History 450px Aura Lea was published by Poulton, an Englishman who had come to America with his family as a boy in 1838, and Fosdick in 1861. It was a sentimental ballad at a time when upbeat and cheerful songs were more popular in the music halls. It became popular as a minstrel song, and the tune was also taken up by the U.S. Military Academy as a graduating class song, called \\"Army Blue\\"; new lyrics by L. W. Becklaw were sung to the original melody. The Civil War began shortly after the song's release, \\"Aura Lea\\" was adopted by soldiers on both sides, and was often sung around campfires. The tune is familiar to modern audiences from the 1956 Elvis Presley #1 hit \\"Love Me Tender\\" with new lyrics by Ken Darby, a derivative adaptation of the original. A later Presley recording for the film The Trouble with Girls entitled \\"Violet (Flower of N.Y.U.)\\" also used the melody of \\"Aura Lea\\". Lyrics The lyrics as written by Fosdick: > When the blackbird in the Spring, On the willow tree, Sat and rocked, I > heard him sing, Singing Aura Lea. Aura Lea, Aura Lea, Maid with golden hair; > Sunshine came along with thee, And swallows in the air. :Chorus: :Aura Lea, > Aura Lea, :Maid with golden hair; :Sunshine came along with thee, :And > swallows in the air. In thy blush the rose was born, Music, when you spake, > Through thine azure eye the morn, Sparkling seemed to break. Aura Lea, Aura > Lea, Birds of crimson wing, Never song have sung to me, As in that sweet > spring. :(Chorus) Aura Lea! the bird may flee, The willow's golden hair > Swing through winter fitfully, On the stormy air. Yet if thy blue eyes I > see, Gloom will soon depart; For to me, sweet Aura Lea Is sunshine through > the heart. :(Chorus) When the mistletoe was green, Midst the winter's snows, > Sunshine in thy face was seen, Kissing lips of rose. Aura Lea, Aura Lea, > Take my golden ring; Love and light return with thee, And swallows with the > spring. :(Chorus) In popular culture \\"Aura Lee\\" was sung by Frances Farmer and a male chorus in the 1936 film Come and Get It, based on Edna Ferber's novel. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album Join Bing and Sing Along (1959) Diana Muldaur sings the song to David Carradine in the episode \\"The Elixir\\" of Kung Fu. Jerry Lanning performed the song in \\"Big Star\\", a 1962 episode of The Donna Reed Show. The television cavalry comedy F Troop used a variation of the song to welcome saloon singer Laura Lee in the episode \\"She's Only a Build in a Girdled Cage\\" (cf. \\"She's only a bird in a gilded cage\\"). The television western The Young Riders used the song in its series finale, which took place in 1861 and showed how the American Civil War was affecting its characters' lives. It is the running theme music in the background of the 1954 John Ford film The Long Gray Line. Allan Sherman topicalized the song with this polio- based version: > Every time you take vaccine, take it orally [a pun on \\"Aura Lea\\"] As you > know the other way is more painfully! An episode of The Rockford Files called \\"Aura Lee Farewell\\". However the few lyrics that are recited are actually from the poem \\"Annabel Lee\\" by Edgar Allan Poe. On the show Beverly Hills 90210 on the episode The Real McCoy (05/10/95), Dylan McKay Luke Perry was led into a past life in the wild wild west through hypnotic regression with his hypnotherapist. During his hypnosis session, he imagined that he walked into a saloon, where a hurdy gurdy girl was singing \\"Aura Lea.\\" The tune is used by the Cartoon Planet Band in the song \\"I Love Almost Everybody\\" which was also found on the associated album, Space Ghost's Musical Bar-B-Que. Caitl√≠n R. Kiernan's 2007 novel Daughter of Hounds has a character singing the winter verse of \\"Aura Lee\\" during a snowstorm. Oona Laurence sings the song in the Sofia Coppola film The Beguiled (2017). =Parody= The 1983 film Trading Places includes Ivy League stockbrokers at their racquet club singing a sexualized parody of this song about their college days and their fraternity's conquest of various women on locations at campus, with the refrain changed to \\"Constance Frye.\\" The television show How I Met Your Mother 2009 episode (season 5 episode 22) \\"Robots Versus Wrestlers\\" features Ted Mosby at an upper-class party singing the Trading Places \\"Constance Frye\\" version along with film director Peter Bogdanovich and The New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz.

The film unfolds in the real time narration method. It was Donner's last directorial credit for many years until it was announced in 2020 that he would direct a fifth Lethal Weapon film.  Plot  Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is an alcoholic, burned-out NYPD detective. Despite a late shift the night before, his lieutenant orders him to escort a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), from local custody to the courthouse 16 blocks away to testify on a police corruption case before a grand jury at 10 a.m. Bunker tries to be friendly with Mosley, telling him of his aspirations to move to Seattle to become a cake baker with his sister who he has never met, but Mosley is uninterested, and stops at a liquor store. They are suddenly ambushed by a gunman, and Mosley drags Bunker to a local bar to take shelter and call for backup. Mosley's former partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse), and several other officers arrive. Nugent and his men are part of the corruption scheme, and he tells Mosley that Bunker is not worth defending as his testimony will likely expose several corrupt officers, including Nugent. The corrupt cops try to frame Bunker for firing at an officer before they try to kill him. Mosley intervenes, rescuing Bunker and fleeing. Mosley briefly stops at his sister Diane's (Jenna Stern) apartment to retrieve guns and ammo, and learns the police have already approached her about his activities earlier that day. He and Bunker take steps to further elude the police, and Mosley is wounded in the process. They become cornered in a run-down apartment building as Nugent and his men search floor by floor. Mosley calls the district attorney to arrange for help, but purposely gives the wrong apartment number, suspecting there is a mole involved. Mosley and Bunker are able to escape onto a passenger bus, and as the police follow them, Mosley is forced to treat the passengers as hostages. The bus crashes into a construction site and is soon surrounded by the ESU. Aware that Nugent will likely order the ESU to raid the bus, risking the safety of the passengers, Mosley allows the passengers to go free, using their cover to allow Bunker to sneak off the bus in the confusion. Mosley finds a tape recorder in the discarded possessions on the bus, and prepares a farewell message to Diane. To his surprise, Bunker returns to the bus; while Nugent is ready to fire on him, Nugent is made to stand down by a superior officer. Bunker has come to see Mosley as his friend and wants to be there for him to see this through. Bunker's tenacity convinces Mosley to get to the courthouse, and he manages to drive the bus into an alley, temporarily blocking the police from following them. He finds that Bunker has been wounded, and calls Diane, a paramedic, to bring an ambulance around to help, despite knowing she will be followed. Diane cares for Mosley and Bunker's wounds, though Bunker still needs further treatment at a hospital. As Diane's ambulance drives away, the police stop her but discover the ambulance is empty; she had a second ambulance pick up Mosley and Bunker that would not be under similar surveillance. Meanwhile, Mosley reveals to Bunker that should he testify, not only will Nugent be convicted but so would Mosley as one of the corrupt cops. Mosley gets off a block from the courthouse and wishes Bunker luck with his bakery, instructing the paramedic to take Bunker to the Port Authority and put him on a bus for Seattle. Bunker promises to send him a cake on his birthday. Mosley continues to the courthouse, where the police and ESU are waiting for him, as well as the district attorney. Mosley enters the courthouse building through the underground garage, encountering Nugent alone, who tries unsuccessfully to dissuade him from testifying in Bunker's place. Mosley enters the courthouse proper, where one of Nugent's men (David Zayas) tries to shoot Mosley but is killed by one of the ESU snipers. Mosley informs the district attorney that he will testify in exchange for Bunker having his record expunged, also revealing that he had recorded the conversation with Nugent in the garage on the tape recorder, which he submits as evidence. Two years later, Mosley is freed from prison. He celebrates his birthday with Diane and other friends, and is surprised to find that the cake had indeed come from Bunker, who has been successful in starting \\"Eddie & Jack's Good Sign Bakery\\" in Seattle.

Alternate ending  The film was shot with the ending written for the screenplay (as described by Donner and writer Richard Wenk), but they realized during filming that there was \\"a better opportunity to have a little more empathy and wrap the picture up in a different way.\\" The ending written for the film changed the scenario for the last two scenes in that Mosley (Willis) was instead not shot and killed after meeting the ADA after Nugent (Morse) tried to stop the shooting, with Mosley dying in his arms and the recording playing out loud; the last scene still involves Bunker (Def) having a successful business and sending a cake, but the scene involves Mosley's sister having told him about Mosley's death while visiting Seattle.  Box office  The film, released by Warner Bros., opened in the United States on March 3, 2006. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $12.7 million, which was the second-highest grossing film of the weekend. As of its May 15, 2006 closing date, the film grossed a total of $36.895 million in the U.S. box office. It made $65.6 million worldwide. According to Box Office Mojo, production costs were around $55 million. The film made $51.53 million on rentals, and remained on the DVD top 50 charts for 17 consecutive weeks.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 56% approval rating from 162 critics, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Despite strong performances from Bruce Willis and Mos Def, 16 Blocks barely rises above being a shopworn entry in the buddy-action genre.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 34 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice commented that \\"the clich√©s come thick on the ground\\" and called it \\"a small movie trying to seem epic, or a bloated monster trying to seem lean.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars and called Willis and Mos Def \\"a terrific team,\\" concluding that \\"Until Richard Wenk's script drives the characters into a brick wall of pukey sentiment, it's a wild ride.\\" Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and commended Mos Def for his \\"character performance that's completely unexpected in an action movie,\\" while calling the film \\"a chase picture conducted at a velocity that is just about right for a middle-age alcoholic.\\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe described the film as admirably old fashioned, praising Donner for his direction, but criticized the film for lacking originality, saying it feels like a remake of The Gauntlet directed by Clint Eastwood. Remake In May 2013, Original Entertainment confirmed to have sealed a five-picture deal with Millennium Films to produce Bollywood remakes of Rambo, The Expendables, 16 Blocks, 88 Minutes, and Brooklyn's Finest, with the productions for Rambo and The Expendables expected to start at the end of that year.

It was only made available for sale at some concert venue merchandise stalls on tour in 1993, through Prince's 1-800-NEW-FUNK telephone retail outlet, and at Paisley Park during the 2001 Celebration. It was also sold in Prince's own, now defunct, retail outlets. It is long out of print, thus very scarce and can fetch high prices second-hand. The track \\"Guess Who's Knockin'\\" referenced Paul McCartney's \\"Let 'Em In\\" without credit. Probably to avoid any legal difficulties, the track was removed from second and subsequent pressings, making initial copies of the album even more highly sought after. The album presents hip hop in the setting of a live band. Vocalist Tony M. raps on most of the songs and a variety of segues throughout the album provide a humorous storyline about the recording of the album, as well as Tony M.'s sexual exploits. Many of the themes are about racism and other ills in the black community. Prince plays a background role in the album, though he sings in character on the songs \\"Black M.F. In the House\\" and \\"Johnny\\". Both songs were played live in concert by Prince several times during this time period. The track \\"Call the Law\\" is older than most of the songs, being considered for release on an early version of 1991's Diamonds and Pearls and later being released as a B-side for a track from that album, \\"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\\".

Sinegal (born January 1, 1936), also known as Jim Sinegal, is a retired American billionaire businessman who is the co-founder and former CEO of the Costco Wholesale Corporation,Allison, Melissa, \\"Costco's colorful CEO, co-founder Jim Sinegal to retire\\", The Seattle Times, August 31, 2011 an international retail chain. Early life and education He was born January 1, 1936, into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Lawrence O'Toole primary school, Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh), Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955. He attended San Diego State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959.Forbes: CEOs: James D. Sinegal. Career After Sinegal started as a grocery bagger at FedMart in 1955, he discovered that he loved the retail business, and was excited by the opportunities at this rapidly growing retailer. At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations. He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium from 1977 to 1978, an executive vice president for the Price Company from 1978 to 1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlin and Associates, a company that acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products. Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco. From 1983 until his December 31, 2011 retirement, Sinegal served as Costco's president and CEO. As CEO, Sinegal was well known for traveling to each location every year, to inspect them personally. Sinegal's innovations made Costco the first \\"warehouse club\\" to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations in its mix of goods and services. Sinegal was a prot√©g√© of Sol Price, widely considered to be the \\"father\\" of the \\"warehouse club\\" concept. Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management rooted in the belief that employees who are treated well, will in turn, treat/serve customers well. Sinegal, through Costco, provided his employees ‚Äî at every level of the company, including the stores ‚Äî compensation and benefits that are much higher than retail industry norms. For example, over 90% of Costco employees qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance; the U.S. retail industry average is just under sixty percent. As a result, Costco has the lowest employee turnover rate in retail. In 1993, when growing competition threatened both Price Club and Costco Wholesale, Sinegal was invited to a partial merger. The two companies entered into a partial merger just after Price's earnings dropped to 40%. The new company, named PriceCostco, Inc., focused heavily on international expansion, opening stores in Mexico, South Korea, and England. Despite best efforts to recover losses, sales continued to drop. Robert Price and Jim Sinegal had different opinions regarding company direction and recovery policies. The breakup was formally announced in 1994. Price's breakaway company was named as Price Enterprises. Sinegal still continued to manage PriceCostco, Inc. In 1997, the name of Sinegal's company was changed to Costco Wholesale. In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he did not care about Wall Street analysts who had criticized him for putting good treatment of employees and customers ahead of pleasing shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, \\"We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now.\\" A favorite quote attributed to Sinegal, in part about his philosophy on dealing with success, is, \\"You have to take the shit with the sugar.\\" Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later ‚Äî a return of 354% (15.855%, annually). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five thousand percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO. In 2009, Sinegal was considered one of \\"The TopGun CEOs\\" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.The Market's Best Managers - Forbes.com, Forbes.comBrendan Wood International Announces 24 TopGun CEOs in the US , Reuters.com Retirement On January 1, 2012, Sinegal retired as CEO of Costco Wholesale, continued to serve as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. Sinegal retired from the Board of Directors in January 2018. Personal life In 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co- owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise. The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).

Support for Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy  Ravi Grover is well known in India as a proponent of nuclear energy as can be seen from his publications related to nuclear energy. He is an editor of the International Journal of Nuclear Knowledge Management.Nuclear Knowledge Management Dr Grover along with his colleagues formulated a scenario for growth of electricity demand in India by taking into consideration economic growth, population growth, and improvement in energy intensity of GDP and formulating a possible supply mix considering India's fuel resource base to delineate niche area for nuclear energy. This was the first such long-term forecast of electricity demand in India and firmly established the role of nuclear energy in India's electricity mix. Based on a very simple logic, in an article published in The Hindu, he explains why India needs nuclear energy.The Hindu, 31 August 2017.

He became the first prime minister of Indonesia in 1945, after a career as a key Indonesian nationalist organizer in the 1930s and 1940s. From there, Sutan worked hard as Prime Minister to ensure Indonesia was living up to its name. He was considered an idealist and an intellectual who despite his political interest, put his country first before his own needs. Unlike some of his colleagues, he did not support the Japanese and worked to gain independence for Indonesia. Sjahrir was a close associate of the older statesman Mohammad Hatta, a key leader of the Indonesian revolution and leader of the Indonesian underground resistance during the Japanese occupation. Sutan Sjahrir was imprisoned by Sukarno, and then released by Sukarno in 1965 so he could seek medical treatment. Sjahrir went to Zurich Switzerland where he then died after a stroke at age 56. Early life Sjahrir was born in 1909 in Padang Panjang, West Sumatra. He was born to a Minangkabau family from Koto Gadang, Agam. His father was the chief public prosecutor in Medan and advisor to the Sultan of Deli. His eldest half-sister Siti Rohana (nicknamed the Minangkabau Kartini) was an advocate for women's education and a journalist with the first feminist newspaper of Sumatra. He studied (ELS and MULO) in Medan and in 1926 (AMS) in Bandung. During his school years in Medan, he was a violinist in Hotel de Boer at night. In Bandung he became co-founder of the 'People's University', battling illiteracy and raising funds for the performance of patriotic plays in the Priangan countryside. =Nationalist Student activist in the Netherlands= Sjahrir arrived in the Netherlands in 1929, enrolling first at the University of Amsterdam and later becoming a law student at Leiden University where he gained an appreciation for socialist principles. He was a part of several labor unions as he worked to support himself. He was briefly the secretary of the Perhimpoenan Indonesia (Indonesian Association), an organization of Indonesian students in the Netherlands. Sjahrir was also one of the co-founders of Jong Indonesie, an Indonesian youth association in lieu of the need of an association to assist in the development of Indonesian youth for further generations, only to change within a few years to Pemuda Indonesia. This, in particular, played an important role in the Youth Congress (Sumpah Pemuda), in which the association helped the congress itself to run. During his political activities as a student in the Netherlands he became a close associate of the older independence activist Mohammad Hatta, future vice-president of Indonesia. While he spent years in exile in the Banda Islands, he taught the local children to love their country and inspired them in many ways. The Perhimpoenan Indonesia came under increasing communist influence, and Hatta and Sjahrir were both expelled in 1931. In a reaction to the intrigue by communist cells in the PI against Hatta and himself Sjahrir stayed calm and in character. In his memoirs their Dutch associate Sol Tas recalls: \\"He was not intimidated for one minute by official or quasi-official declarations, by communiques or other formulae, not afraid for one second of the maneuvers directed against him, and still less concerned for his reputation. That mixture of self-confidence and realism, that courage based on the absence of any ambition or vanity, marked the man.\\" =Nationalist leader in the Dutch East Indies= Sjahrir had not finished his law degree, when Hatta sent Sjahrir ahead of him to the Dutch East Indies in 1931, to help set up the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Sjahrir was heavily involved in the Daulat Rajat, the newspaper of the new PNI. Within a relatively short time he developed from a representative of Hatta into a political and intellectual leader with his own standing. Both leaders were imprisoned in the Cipinang Penitentiary Institution by the Dutch in March 1934 and convicted for nationalist activities in November 1934, exiled to Boven Digul where they arrived March 1935, then to Banda a year later, and just before the Indies fell to the Japanese in 1941, to Sukabumi. =Resistance leader during the Japanese occupation= During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia he had little public role, apparently sick with tuberculosis, while he was actually one of the few independence leaders that was involved in the resistance movement against the Japanese occupation. Sukarno, Hatta and Sjahrir had in fact agreed that Sjahrir would go underground to organise the revolutionary resistance while the other 2 would continue their cooperation with the Japanese occupier.All 3 biographies (Sukarno, Hatta, Sjahrir) confirm this. See: Mrazek, Rudolf Sjahrir: politics in exile in Indonesia (SEAP Cornell South East Asia program, 1994) P.222 Prime minister Our Struggle book cover, 1945 At the height of chaos and violence during the early Bersiap period of the Indonesian revolution Sjahrir published an epoch-making pamphlet named 'Our Struggle'. Originally published in Dutch as 'Indonesische Overpeinzingen' ('Indonesian Musings'), it was soon thereafter translated into the Indonesian language as 'Perdjoeangan Kita' in 1945, and was then translated into the English language by Charles Wolf Jr. and named 'Out of Exile' published by John Day, New York, 1949. The English version contains a considerable amount of additional text. \\"Perhaps the high point of his career was the publication of his pamphlet 'Our Struggle'. Whoever reads that pamphlet today can scarcely comprehend what it demanded in insight and courage. For it appeared at a moment when the Indonesian masses, brought to the boiling point by the Japanese occupation and civil war, sought release in racist and other hysterical outbursts. Sjahrir's pamphlet went directly against this, and many must have felt his call for chivalry, for the understanding of other ethnic groups, as a personal attack.\\" Sol Tas. Sjahrir in 1946 After writing his pamphlet he was appointed Prime Minister by President Sukarno in November 1945 and served until June 1947. Professor Wertheim describes Sjahrir's early accomplishments as Prime minister as follows: \\"...Sjahrir knows what he wants and will not be distracted by popular sentiment or circumstantiality. He is able to overturn a ministry fabricated by the Japanese and establish a new ministry of honest, fairly capable, fairly democratic and social minded men under his leadership. No small feat in revolutionary circumstances...\\"Wertheim, W.F.\\"Nederland op de tweesprong.\\" (Publisher: Van Loghum Slaterus, Amsterdam, 1946) Due to his non-cooperative stance during the Japanese occupation he was one of the few Republican leaders acceptable to the Dutch government during the early independence negotiations. In 1946 Sjahrir played a crucial role in negotiating the Linggadjati Agreement. Because his thoughts were ahead of his time he was often misunderstood and started to acquire internal political adversaries.Anwar, Rosihan (2010) Sutan Sjahrir: Demokrat Sejati, Pejuang Kemanusiaan (‚ÄúSutan Sjahrir: True Democrat, Fighter for Humanity‚Äù), Jakarta : Penerbit Buku Kompas : KITLV Press, 2010 One of his opponents was Subandrio who became Sukarno's right hand man and was later on involved in Sjahrir's imprisonment.

In 'Perdjoeangan Kita' (Our Struggle), October 1945, > Sjahrir.Sjahrir (1945) Political leader Sjahrir speaking at a PSI election rally in Bali in 1955 Although Sjahrir was one of the most significant Indonesian politicians of his time, he did not engage in politics through a sense of vocation nor out of interest, but rather through a sense of duty to his country and compatriots and commitment to his democratic ideals. Described as an omnivorous intellectual Sjahrir had education at the heart of his passion. When he was appointed Prime Minister in 1945, he was the youngest prime minister in the world only being 36 years old. > \\"I really find teaching the greatest work there is, for helping young people > to shape themselves is one of the noblest tasks of society.\\" Sutan Sjahrir. Sjahrir founded the Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI) in 1948 to politically oppose the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Sutan's socialist party ultimately failed to win support and was later banned in 1960.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Already in the mid 1930s Sjahrir warned for the tendency of socialists to be dragged into the notions of the extreme political left. Sjahrir described his fear of the trend of socialists to adopt ideas of communist absolutism as follows: \\"Those socialist activists, with all good intentions, suddenly and unnoticed become 'absolute' thinkers, 'absolutely' discarding freedom, 'absolutely' spitting on humanity and the rights of the individual.[...]They envision the terminus of human development as one huge military complex of extreme order and discipline [...]\\"Sjahrir, Soetan \\"Indonesische overpeinzingen\\" (Publisher: Bezige Bij, Amsterdam, 1945) Although small, his party was very influential in the early post-independence years, because of the expertise and high education levels of its leaders. But the party performed poorly in the 1955 elections, partly due to the fact that the grassroots constituency at the time was unable to fully understand the concepts of social democracy Sjahrir was trying to convey.Anwar, Rosihan (2010) Sutan Sjahrir: Demokrat Sejati, Pejuang Kemanusiaan (‚ÄúSutan Sjahrir: True Democrat, Fighter for Humanity‚Äù) Jakarta : Penerbit Buku Kompas : KITLV Press, 2010 It was banned by President Sukarno in August 1960 because of its support for a rebellion in Sumatra and his oppostion to the president's policies. Final years In 1962 Sjahrir was jailed on alleged conspiracy charges for which he was never put on trial. Instead of fighting back and creating more conflicts, he choose to step back from politics and accept the consequences. During his imprisonment he suffered from high blood pressure and in 1965 had a stroke, losing his speech. He was sent to Z√ºrich, Switzerland for treatment and died there in exile in 1966. Legacy Although a revolutionary opponent of Dutch colonialism his intellectual prowess was recognised by his adversaries and he remained highly respected in the Netherlands.In the Netherlands there are even streets named after Sjahrir. See image of Sjahrirstraat in Leiden: After his death in 1966 the former Dutch Prime-Minister Professor Schermerhorn commemorated Sjahrir in a public broadcast on national radio, calling him a \\"noble political warrior\\" with \\"high ideals\\" and expressing the hope that he will be recognised as such by next generations in Indonesia.Historical Audio Archive: Schermerhorn, Willem In Memoriam: Soetan Sjahrir, (RNW, 1966).

Abies fraseri is closely related to balsam fir (Abies balsamea), of which it has occasionally been treated as a subspecies (as A. balsamea subsp. fraseri (Pursh) E.Murray) or a variety (as A. balsamea var. fraseri (Pursh) Spach).Farjon, A. (1990). Pinaceae. Drawings and Descriptions of the Genera. Koeltz Scientific Books .Liu, T.-S. (1971). A Monograph of the Genus Abies. National Taiwan University.Flora of North America: Abies fraseriGymnosperm Database: Abies fraseri Names Fraser fir on the slopes of Clingmans Dome The species Abies fraseri is named after the Scottish botanist John Fraser (1750‚Äì1811), who made numerous botanical collections in the region. It is sometimes misspelled \\"Frasier,\\" \\"Frazer\\" or \\"Frazier.\\" In the past, it was also sometimes known as \\"she-balsam\\" because resin could be \\"milked\\" from its bark blisters, p343 in contrast to the \\"he balsam\\" (red spruce) which could not be milked. It has also occasionally been called balsam fir, inviting confusion with A. balsamea. p363 Description Seedlings of Fraser fir (blue-green, longer needles) and red spruce (green, shorter needles) Close-up view of Fraser fir foliage Abies fraseri is a small evergreen coniferous tree typically growing between 30 and 50 feet (10‚Äì15 m) tall, but rarely to 80 ft (25 m), with a trunk diameter of 16 to 20 inches (40‚Äì50 cm), but rarely 30 in (75 cm). The crown is conical, with straight branches either horizontal or angled upward at 40¬∞ from the trunk; it is dense when the tree is young and more open in maturity. The bark is thin, smooth, grayish brown, and has numerous resinous blisters on juvenile trees, becoming fissured and scaly in maturity. The leaves are needle-like; arranged spirally on the twigs but twisted at their bases to form 2 rows on each twig; they are 0.4‚Äì0.9 inches (10‚Äì23 mm) long and 79‚Äì87 mil (2‚Äì2.2 mm) broad; flat; flexible; rounded or slightly notched at their apices (tips); dark to glaucous green adaxially (above); often having a small patch of stomata near their apices; and having two silvery white stomatal bands abaxially (on their undersides). Their strong fragrance resembles turpentine. The cones are erect; cylindrical; 1.4 to 2.75 inches (3.5‚Äì7 cm) long, rarely 3.2 in (8 cm), and 1‚Äì1.2 inches (2.5‚Äì3 cm) broad, rarely 1.5 in (4 cm) broad; dark purple, turning pale brown when mature; often resinous; and with long reflexed green, yellow, or pale purple bract scales. The cones disintegrate when mature at 4‚Äì6 months old to release the winged seeds. Some botanists regard the variety of Balsam fir named Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis as a natural hybrid with Fraser fir, denominated Abies √ó phanerolepis (Fernald) Liu. Ecology =Reproduction and growth= Fraser fir is monoecious, meaning that both male and female cones (strobili) occur on the same tree.Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir, Silviculture Manual, Volume 1, US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Retrieved 20 October 2014 Cone buds usually open from mid-May to early June. Female cones are borne mostly in the top few feet of the crown and on the distal ends of branches. Male cones are borne below female cones, but mostly in the upper half of the crown. Seed production may begin when trees are 15 years old. Seeds germinate well on mineral soil, moss, peat, decaying stumps and logs, and even on detritus or litter that is sufficiently moist.Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir. The National Christmas Tree Association, Retrieved 20 Oct 2014 =Distribution= Fraser fir forest, with many trees killed by balsam woolly adelgid Abies fraseri is restricted to the southeastern Appalachian Mountains in southwestern Virginia, western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, where it occurs at high elevations, from 3,900 feet to the summit of Mount Mitchell, the highest point in the region at 6,683 feet (1,200 m up to 2,037 m). It lives in acidic moist but well-drained sandy loam, and is usually mixed with Picea rubens (red spruce). Other trees it grows with include Tsuga caroliniana (Carolina hemlock), Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch), Betula papyrifera (paper birch), and Acer saccharum (sugar maple). The climate is cool and moist, with short, cool summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. =Pests= Abies fraseri is severely damaged by a non-native insect, the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae). The insect's introduction and spread led to a rapid decline in Fraser fir across its range, with over 80 percent of mature trees having been killed. The rapid regeneration of seedlings with lack of canopy has led to good regrowth of healthy young trees where the mature forests once stood. However, when these young trees get old enough for the bark to develop fissures, they may be attacked and killed by the adelgids as well. For this reason, the future of the species is still uncertain, though the Mount Rogers (Virginia) population has largely evaded adelgid mortality. The decline of the Fraser fir in the southern Appalachians has contributed to loss of moss habitat which supports the spruce-fir moss spider. By the late 1990s, the adelgid population was down. While two-thirds of adult trees had been killed by the 1980s, a study of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park showed that as of 2020, the number of adult trees had increased over the previous 30 years, with three times as many on Clingmans Dome. =Threats= The Fraser fir is an endangered species. Threats include climate change, balsam woolly adelgid and destruction of trees for Christmas trees and timber. Cultivation and uses Although not important as a source of timber, Fraser fir is widely used as a Christmas tree. Its mild fragrance, shape, strong limbs, and ability to retain its soft needles (which do not prick easily when hanging ornaments) for a long time when cut make it one of the best trees for this purpose.Hendrix, Steve, \\"A Christmas tree‚Äôs remarkable journey\\", The Washington Post, December 21, 2011. Fraser fir has been used more times as the White House Christmas tree (the official Christmas tree of the President of the United States's White House) than any other tree. It is grown in plantations in Scotland and sold by the thousands throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is also cultivated from seedlings in several northern states in the USA and adjacent parts of Quebec Province, especially for the Christmas tree trade. The combination of form, needle retention, dark blue-green color, pleasant scent and excellent shipping characteristics has led to Fraser fir being a most popular Christmas tree species. Growing and harvesting this species for Christmas trees and boughs is a multimillion- dollar business in the southern Appalachians. North Carolina produces the majority of Fraser fir Christmas trees.\\"Fraser Fir\\". North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Retrieved 24 November 2010. It requires from seven to ten years in the field to produce a high tree. In 2005, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation making the Fraser fir the official Christmas tree of North Carolina.

Origins and development The notion of citta-santƒÅna developed in later Yogacara-thought, where citta-santƒÅna replaced the notion of ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna, the store-house consciousness in which the karmic seeds were stored. It is not a \\"permanent, unchanging, transmigrating entity\\", like the atman, but a series of momentary consciousnesses.Davids, C.A.F. Rhys (1903). \\"The Soul-Theory in Buddhism\\" in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

To avoid reification of the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna, Dharmakƒ´rti (fl. 7th century) wrote a treatise on the nature of the mind stream in his Substantiation of Other mind streams (Sa·πÉt√£n√£ntarasiddhi).Source: (accessed: Wednesday 28 October 2009).

Definitions =Trees= The collection of all finite sequences of elements of a set X is denoted X^{<\\\\omega}. With this notation, a tree is a nonempty subset T of X^{<\\\\omega}, such that if \\\\langle x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{n-1}\\\\rangle is a sequence of length n in T, and if 0\\\\le m, then the shortened sequence \\\\langle x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{m-1}\\\\rangle also belongs to T. In particular, choosing m=0 shows that the empty sequence belongs to every tree. =Branches and bodies= A branch through a tree T is an infinite sequence of elements of X, each of whose finite prefixes belongs to T. The set of all branches through T is denoted [T] and called the body of the tree T. A tree that has no branches is called wellfounded; a tree with at least one branch is illfounded. By K≈ënig's lemma, a tree on a finite set with an infinite number of sequences must necessarily be illfounded. =Terminal nodes= A finite sequence that belongs to a tree T is called a terminal node if it is not a prefix of a longer sequence in T. Equivalently, \\\\langle x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{n-1}\\\\rangle \\\\in T is terminal if there is no element x of X such that that \\\\langle x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{n-1},x\\\\rangle \\\\in T. A tree that does not have any terminal nodes is called pruned. Relation to other types of trees In graph theory, a rooted tree is a directed graph in which every vertex except for a special root vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, and in which the path formed by following these edges from any vertex eventually leads to the root vertex. If T is a tree in the descriptive set theory sense, then it corresponds to a graph with one vertex for each sequence in T, and an outgoing edge from each nonempty sequence that connects it to the shorter sequence formed by removing its last element. This graph is a tree in the graph-theoretic sense. The root of the tree is the empty sequence. In order theory, a different notion of a tree is used: an order-theoretic tree is a partially ordered set with one minimal element in which each element has a well-ordered set of predecessors. Every tree in descriptive set theory is also an order-theoretic tree, using a partial ordering in which two sequences T and U are ordered by T if and only if T is a proper prefix of U. The empty sequence is the unique minimal element, and each element has a finite and well-ordered set of predecessors (the set of all of its prefixes). An order-theoretic tree may be represented by an isomorphic tree of sequences if and only if each of its elements has finite height (that is, a finite set of predecessors). Topology The set of infinite sequences over X (denoted as X^\\\\omega) may be given the product topology, treating X as a discrete space. In this topology, every closed subset C of X^\\\\omega is of the form [T] for some pruned tree T. Namely, let T consist of the set of finite prefixes of the infinite sequences in C. Conversely, the body [T] of every tree T forms a closed set in this topology. Frequently trees on Cartesian products X\\\\times Y are considered. In this case, by convention, we consider only the subset T of the product space, (X\\\\times Y)^{<\\\\omega}, containing only sequences whose even elements come from X and odd elements come from Y (e.g., \\\\langle x_0,y_1,x_2,y_3\\\\ldots,x_{2m}, y_{2m+1}\\\\rangle). Elements in this subspace are identified in the natural way with a subset of the product of two spaces of sequences, X^{<\\\\omega}\\\\times Y^{<\\\\omega} (the subset for which the length of the first sequence is equal to or 1 more than the length of the second sequence). In this way we may identify [X^{<\\\\omega}]\\\\times [Y^{<\\\\omega}] with [T] for over the product space. We may then form the projection of [T], : p[T]=\\\\\\\\{\\\\vec x\\\\in X^{\\\\omega}  (\\\\exists \\\\vec y\\\\in Y^{\\\\omega})\\\\langle \\\\vec x,\\\\vec y\\\\rangle \\\\in [T]\\\\\\\\}.

When he reappeared, he was able to steal absorb Hulk's shadow unto himself and gain a physical form that afforded him an intangible state and Hulk's strength, battling him in the Oklahoma plains until they reached the grid. However, due to him being nothing but a shadow, when more lights from the electric grid were activated by pure chance, his body was dissolved to dust and, before he had a chance to get his mind out of the shadow, his body was turned to dust.

FirstClass's primary markets are the higher-education and K-12 education sectors, including four of the top ten largest school districts in the United States (Las Vegas, NV's Clark County School District, Florida's Broward County Public Schools, Hillsborough County Public Schools, and Chicago Public Schools). The product is part of OpenText's Portfolio Group and runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms, for both client and server. iPhone and Android client applications are also available. According to the company, the product is used at over 3,000 organizations and has 9 million users worldwide. Early history FirstClass was originally a product of SoftArc, formed by three former members of Bell Northern Research, Nortel's research arm located in downtown Toronto. The team, consisting of two brothers and a friend, Steve Asbury, Jon Asbury and Scott Welch had been the primary developers of the successful Meridian Mail system, and styled themselves as the Toronto Ideas Group. After a run-in with management, the three left and formed SoftArc as a consulting firm. FirstClass was created in response to a request by a family friend who worked at the Scarborough Board of Education (now part of the Toronto District School Board). He asked them to find a reasonable Macintosh- based e-mail system that offered both LAN and modem support, a real GUI, and supported both private e-mail as well as public discussion areas (forums). He wanted a system that \\"even teachers could use\\". BBSes offered modem support and public forums, but typically had no LAN support and were character-based. Various LAN e-mail systems existed, those on the Mac had reasonable GUI's, but they tended to have poor modem support and few offered forums. The team found only one product, AppleLink, which came close to filling the requirements. However, it was run on a mainframe for Apple Computer and couldn't be purchased, so the team offered to build a system under contract for $85,000. Scarborough Board really liked the Hypercard prototype, but couldn't afford the price, so they offered to buy a system for $9000 and then help sell it to other boards. The proposal was accepted, and work on EduNet started some time in 1989, debuting in 1990 at the ECOO conference. The first implemented FirstClass system, operated by the Scarborough Board of Education and named \\"ScriBE\\", was administered by the Computers in Education department. It offered access to teachers, students, and parents. In the autumn of 1997, ScriBE was connected successfully to the internet. FCP, the FirstClass Protocol Key to FirstClass's operation was the underlying FCP (FirstClass Protocol). FCP was a transport layer networking protocol that all FirstClass communications used. The protocol guaranteed error-free communications for all activities, not just file transfers. FCP could run on several different physical layers, starting with modems and AppleTalk, and later adding Novell's IPX and TCP/IP. Both the client and server could communicate over any of these links, allowing a user to move from office to home and have access to the same server. FCP was based on a sliding window protocol, using a wide variety of packet sizes tuned to different networking protocols. Later versions of FCP could turn off their own error correction systems when running over error-free links like TCP/IP. FCP also implemented an optional encryption system based on the Blowfish cipher. With all of these features turned off, FCP still offered good performance even on the 2400 bit/s modems common in the era. Additionally, every FCP packet included a \\"task number\\" identifier, similar to the port identifier in TCP/IP. This allowed FCP to construct a number of \\"virtual links\\" between each client and server. The server implemented a multithreaded kernel and opened a new thread for every task requested by a client. Users could therefore upload and download files at the same time, while simultaneously reading and writing mail. The BBS era Basic FirstClass \\"desktop\\", circa 1993 After renaming the product to the more generic FirstClass, they started demonstrating early versions to Toronto-area Mac BBSes. An Apple Canada employee, Mark Windrim, set up a FirstClass BBS in Toronto called MAGIC (the Macintosh Awareness Group in Canada). Local Mac users heard of the system and established accounts, quickly turning it into the largest Mac-oriented BBS system in the area. Having started with a single phone line and a tiny user base, MAGIC became a commercial entity called \\"Magic\\", eventually reached 6,000 users, and had 48 phone lines. Due to the multithreaded nature of the FirstClass client software, the user could open multiple messages at the same time, while uploading and downloading in the background. Whereas most systems indirectly encouraged users to simply \\"leech\\" files and then leave, users waiting for downloads on FirstClass had an entire modem channel free for uploading or writing. SoftArc sought to take advantage of the growing interest by offering reduced prices to BBS operators. During this time, some FirstClass BBS systems mushroomed to thousands of users, including the Boston Computer Society (BCS), which was the largest computer club of that era; the Virginia-based DigitalNation, which had hoped to become an AOL competitor; the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group's Planet BMUG; the BendNet BBS in Bend, Oregon; and Virtual Valley services operated by Silicon Valley's Metro Newspapers group. Another notable system was the Great Lakes Free-Net, billed as \\"the world's first graphical Free-Net,\\" based in Battle Creek, Michigan. The FirstClass software later incorporated a feature that allowed individual FirstClass sites to share conference content and private mail by allowing the servers to link together. Originally this was accomplished via dialup connections, but eventually allowed sites to link via the internet using internet connections. Apple employee Scott Converse formed the first and probably the most extensive network of FirstClass-based sites in the world, known as OneNet.Scott Converse, How the OneNet Started , OneNet. Retrieved August 22, 2008. By 1994, the internet was becoming a major force, obsoleting most BBS systems on both Mac and Windows over the next year or so. Corporate e-mail and collaboration By the mid 1990s FirstClass had evolved into a small-to-medium-sized internal e-mail system,http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/bbsfaq05.txt but its BBS continued to receive attention.Nicholas Baran, Businesses Turn to BBSes , Byte, September 1994 A FirstClass client for Microsoft Windows was introduced, along with a Windows NT-based server. During the mid-1990s FirstClass evolved to compete in the groupware marketplace. The product was successful to some degree, besting Microsoft Exchange in number of installed users until 1997. FirstClass added internet functionality and a scripting method by 2000 but both Lotus and Microsoft had introduced these features earlier and FirstClass lost market share to them. The Mac market simultaneously declined through the mid to late 1990s, eroding the product's primary customer base. Even among those organizations that considered using the FirstClass system, the lack of a robust calendaring component during this time (until FirstClass version 6 in 2001) was an obvious flaw. Nevertheless, FirstClass was recognized as a notable (though not top) vendor of worldwide integrated collaborative environments by International Data Corporation in 2004.Mark Levitt and Robert P. Mahowald, Worldwide Integrated Collaborative Environments 2003. Vendor Analysis: How to Keep Moving When Surrounded by ICE , International Data Corporation, July 2004.(PDF) Retrieved August 22, 2008. During this period FirstClass added a voice mail solution integrated with the server. The feature, commonly known as unified messaging, allowed users to receive voice, fax and e-mail in their mailbox. In 2007 with the release of version 9, FirstClass redesigned its interface and introduced an automatic server-based and policy-driven archiving service for legal compliance purposes, and full Unicode support.http://www.firstclass.com/ResourcesFolder/ResourcesPDFs/Whats%20New%20in%20FirstClass%209.0.pdf By the end of 2010, version 11 was released, with mobile clients for Apple iOS, Android and Blackberry made available during 2011. IMAP mail and RSS support was added in version 11.1 in 2012. Tools FirstClass Application Services or \\"FCAS\\" (formerly called \\"RAD\\" for \\"Rapid Application Development\\") allows third-party developers to create tools and applications for use with FirstClass. The BASIC-like language is documented in the FirstClass client's online Help, under Customization Tools, FCAS, Language Reference. With the release of FirstClass 12, FirstClass introduces a fully supported and documented Application Programming Interface (API) that will allow web developers to retrieve authenticated secure information from their FirstClass Collaborative system, and display it within their own web site. FirstClass API Company history In 1999 the company arranged a reverse takeover by a company from Vancouver to become listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as Centrinity.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_August_22/ai_64453221/ In September 2002 OpenText bought Centrinity, for a reported C$1.26 per share or C$19 million. OpenText was developing a suite of online collaboration products through a series of mergers, and FirstClass's educational background seemed to fit particularly well with some of their other offerings. At the time OpenText stated their intention to integrate FirstClass into the \\"LiveLink\\" internet information collection engine, but this integration has not yet happened and is rumored to be not practical due to the architecture of LiveLink. As of March 31, 2010, the original founders of the FirstClass product and company (Steve Asbury, Jon Asbury, and Scott Welch) and two longtime employees (John Myers and Barry Carter) are no longer employed by OpenText; the only reason given was a difference of opinions in the future direction of the FirstClass product and other derivative products. They have since developed Edsby, a product that blends social media and classroom management tools. The next year would see many other key team members voluntarily move on to new challenges. Among those departing were the UX designers behind FirstClass' rebirth as OpenText Social Media: one for Research In Motion, the other to start his own company. In June and August 2011, there were two more rounds of layoffs. Long-time employees Paul Whittemore, Desmond Ong, and Julie Oke, along with several others, asked to be included. Senior managers Terry Whyte and Dave Wormald left over the course of the summer. OpenText continues to develop the FirstClass software suite which has been opened up to support external \\"Apps\\".  Market share challenges  As free offerings from Google Apps for Education and Office 365 for Education have become increasingly popular and functional, the traditional paid product that FirstClass offers has apparently become more difficult to justify in educational environments.

The concept of internal sets is a tool in formulating the transfer principle, which concerns the logical relation between the properties of the real numbers R, and the properties of a larger field denoted *R called the hyperreal numbers. The field *R includes, in particular, infinitesimal (\\"infinitely small\\") numbers, providing a rigorous mathematical justification for their use. Roughly speaking, the idea is to express analysis over R in a suitable language of mathematical logic, and then point out that this language applies equally well to *R. This turns out to be possible because at the set-theoretic level, the propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to internal sets rather than to all sets (note that the term \\"language\\" is used in a loose sense in the above). Edward Nelson's internal set theory is an axiomatic approach to nonstandard analysis (see also Palmgren at constructive nonstandard analysis). Conventional infinitary accounts of nonstandard analysis also use the concept of internal sets. Internal sets in the ultrapower construction Relative to the ultrapower construction of the hyperreal numbers as equivalence classes of sequences \\\\langle u_n\\\\rangle, an internal subset [An] of *R is one defined by a sequence of real sets \\\\langle A_n \\\\rangle, where a hyperreal [u_n] is said to belong to the set [A_n]\\\\subset \\\\; ^*\\\\\\\\!{\\\\mathbb R} if and only if the set of indices n such that u_n \\\\in A_n, is a member of the ultrafilter used in the construction of *R. More generally, an internal entity is a member of the natural extension of a real entity. Thus, every element of *R is internal; a subset of *R is internal if and only if it is a member of the natural extension ^* \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}) of the power set \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\mathbb{R}) of R; etc. Internal subsets of the reals Every internal subset of \\\\mathbb{R} is necessarily finite, (e.g. has no infinite elements, but can have infinitely many elements; see Theorem 3.9.1 Goldblatt, 1998). In other words, every internal infinite subset of the hyperreals necessarily contains nonstandard elements.

History KQCH's origins began on May 21, 1999, when it flipped from Adult Contemporary to Rhythmic Contemporary as \\"Channel 97.7\\". The station became a serious challenger to Top 40 Mainstream KQKQ-FM during its three years on the 97.7 frequency. The 94.1 frequency was originally KOAD, owned by the Omaha World-Herald, and launched on 94.3 FM in 1941. This lasted until 1949, when it moved to 94.1 and went silent. In 1959, it returned to the air as KMEO, where it had a MOR format until 1968, when it became AOR KOWH-FM. By 1979, KOWH-FM switched formats to R&B; as KYNN-FM under then-new owner Great Empire Broadcasting, lasting until 1982, when it flipped to country. In September 1983, it became WOW-FM and retained the country format, where it enjoyed a successful 17-year run. Journal Broadcasting would buy out Great Empire in 1999.

Biography  = Early life and education = Of rural origin, Mamadou Dia was born in Khombole, in the Thies Region of Senegal, on 18 July 1910. His father, a veteran turned into a policeman, played a key role in transmitting him faith to Sufi Islam and was an important example of rectitude. Former pupil of the Blanchot elementary school in Saint- Louis, began his education in a Quranic school to later move into western education at the √âcole William Ponty,principal training ground of the elite in French Africa in the 20s and 30s. Eventually, he persuaded graduate studies in economics at the University of Paris. Before entering politics (became motivated to so only after Vichy regime collapsed) in the early 1940s, he worked as journalist, teacher and school director. In his book ‚ÄúAfrica, the price of freedom‚Äù (2001, edited by L'Harmattan) he stated to believe to be actually born (according to some papers belonging to his father he had found) in July 1911. It has been a teacher who made him one year older on official documents to allow him to pass the competition for the William Ponty school, as otherwise he would have been too young to candidate. = Political career = Dia started life in politics in 1947 as a leader in the Grand Council of the Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise (AOF) and as Secretary General of the Senegalese Democratic Bloc (BDS) from the following year. He served in the French Senate from 1948 to 1956 and as deputy in the French National Assembly from 1956 to 1958, sitting with the parliamentary group of Overseas Independent (IOM). With Senghor, Dia formed the African Convention Party (PCA) in January 1957 from the BDS. When Charles de Gaulle proposed a referendum on the French community in 1958, the two leaders stand by two opposite positions: Dia is in favor of a break with France, while Senghor wants to keep Senegal in the community, During his two terms as a senator, Mamadou Dia voted for the ratification of the Atlantic Pact (July 28, 1949), voted for the law Marie favorable to private education (September 12), and declared himself in favor of the ratification of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (1 st April 1952). On March 26, 1955, he opposed plans relating to the WEU, the end of the occupation in Germany, its entry into NATO and the Saar Agreement. It approved the draft law on state of emergency in Algeria (1 st April) and abstained on the draft electoral reform restoring the district election (15 November). He was also an active member of parliament, being a frequent speaker and devoting himself to the problems of the overseas territories. Dia was one of the main figures (namely vice premier) of the abortive Mali Federation of Senegal and Sudanese Republic (later Mali) until its collapse.https://www.jstor.org/stable/158851?seq=1 Once independence has been proclaimed on August 20, 1960, he became Prime minister, in tandem with Senghor as President of the Republic of Senegal who, as a Catholic in a largely Islamic country, valued having a widely connected and able Muslim as his deputy. His time served as Prime Minister was often controversial and his radical socialist views often clashed with those of the more moderate Senghor. = Departure from Senghor and imprisonment = After slightly more than two years of legislature, Mamadou Dia was at the center of his country's first major post-independence crisis in December 1962, when he unsuccessfully attempted to stage a constitutional coup against Senghor. It was taken at the time as a classic example of the difficulties of power sharing in new-born states: Dia embodied the summit of the State in a two-headed parliamentary system (economic and internal policy for him, foreign policy for the President). However, different views with regards to the economy, played a major role: there was a serious liberal versus radical policy divide. In fact, Dia began to implement some of the radical ideas he had articulated in his book R√©flexions sur l'√âconomie de l'Afrique Noire (1960), which rose concern among the Marabouts, the powerful religious leaders who controlled the groundnut business, and runs counter to French interests. As result of the grave power struggle between the two former political allies, a group of dissident parliamentarians motivated by Senghor, tabled a motion of no confidence against the government, thus on Dia. He responded by invoking executive powers and ordering the army to lock the assembly building before the vote could be taken. Senghor charged it as an attempted coup, in turn calling out the army, which was in the majority loyal to him. Dia and several of his ministers were arrested and tried for treason. Eventually, he was forced to resign and subsequently imprisoned (initially sentenced to life in prison) in the eastern town of K√©dougou, until 1974, but later pardoned (1974) and given amnesty (1976). = Late life = His political power may have been broken but not his spirit. Dia attempted to restart his career in the early 1980s, once multiparty democracy had been introduced by Abdou Douf, but the small party he led (the People Democratic Movement) found little support. Thus, he never returned to a position of power; however, he remained an iconic figure in Senegalese politics, retaining an intellectual and moral place in the country. He accompanied the Senegalese state during the years of decolonization and remained one of the main figures in the construction of modern Senegal. He gradually acquired the role of national treasure, as he continued regularly to write diatribes in the local press well into his 90s. He was noted for his attacks on the neo-liberal economic policies of the current president, Abdoulaye Wade, who ironically had been one of the lawyers who defended Dia in 1963. After his death on the 25th January 2009 (at the age of 98, in Dakar), there was a massive outpouring of sentiment in national newspapers due to admiration for his obdurate attachment to principles. \\"Dia ne s‚Äôest jamais defait de son idealism pour devenir un homme d‚ÄôEtat\\"  Church and state relation  When Leopold Senghor (Catholic) and Mamadou Dia (Muslim) led Senegal to independence they had very clear ideas of what ideological and philosophical values would have formed the basis of the new State. African socialism, spirituality and secularisms were the concepts to guide the country towards modernity and development with a spirit of tolerance and pluralism to define their project. The two figures were both fundamentally convinced, on the one hand, of the necessity of a secular state, and on the other, that religious fervor is a cultural energy essential for achieving modernization. And that is why they charged themselves and their fellow nation builders, the institutions, the party and especially the political discourse with the mission of realizing the ideal of a nation uplifted by the spirit, committed to secularism and thus, ultimately, prosperous. Dia‚Äôs reflection on Islam (like those contained in his Islam, African Societies and Industrial Culture) are useful to understand the degree of faith he had in this spiritualist socialism as motivating force of development in Senegal. ‚ÄúIslam must remind the Muslim world [‚Ä¶] that if it is required to act, it is so that one may fulfill oneself, that one may achieve even richer being. For industrial development to be a boon and not the ruin of mankind, it is crucial that it retain a human dimension, that it not give rise to a new kind of slavery under the pretense of promoting productivity or efficacy, that it not create progress that is in reality perversion, desire of well-being and not of better-being [‚Ä¶]‚Äù It is the philosophy of a modern Islam actively participating in a process of transformation of itself and of the world in conformity with demands of justice. This interpretation of secularization put Senegal out of the heir of France (where takes the form of a permanent hostility to any manifestation of religion) and more in Anglo-Saxon model of relation between church and State: aim to guarantee the autonomy of religious communities. Unfortunately, the reality happened to be different from the initial project as Senghor and Dia had to partially renounce to their ideas and had to accept a compromise pact to assure the support, especially during elections, of the marabouts (which thus became an integral part of the political life). Eventually, the demarcation between religion and politics was more blurred than what they initially hoped.

The term \\"Independent Catholic\\" derives from the fact that \\"these denominations affirm both their belonging to the Catholic tradition as well as their independence from Rome.\\"Mauro Castagnaro, (foreword) in It is difficult to determine the number of jurisdictions, communities, clergy and members who make up Independent Catholicism, particularly since the movement \\"is growing and changing in every moment.\\" Some adherents choose Independent Catholicism as an alternative way to live and express their Catholic faith outside the Roman Catholic Church (with whose structures, beliefs and practices Independent Catholicism often closely aligns) while rejecting some traditional Catholic teachings. Independent Catholicism may be considered part of a larger Independent Sacramental Movement, in which clergy and laity of various faith traditions‚Äìincluding the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion and various non-Catholic Christian churches‚Äì have separated themselves from the institutions with which they previously identified. Within the Independent Sacramental Movement, various independent churches have sprung from the Eastern Orthodox Church, but the members of these independent Orthodox groups most often self-identify as Independent or Autocephalous Orthodox and not as Independent Catholic. History =Early episcopal consecrations without papal approval= Dominique Marie Varlet, Catholic Bishop of Babylon (1678‚Äì1742) Beginning in 1724, Dominique Marie Varlet (1678‚Äì1742), the Roman Catholic Bishop of Babylon, consecrated four successive men as Archbishop of Utrecht without papal approval. The cathedral chapter of Utrecht, which elected these men, had previously obtained an opinion from Zeger Bernhard van Espen (1646‚Äì1728) and two other doctors of canon law at the University of Louvain, which said that the chapter had the right, in special circumstances, to elect its own archbishop and have him consecrated without the consent of the pope, and that, in the case of necessity, one bishop alone might validly consecrate another. Nineteen doctors of the theological faculties at Paris, Nantes, Rheims and Padua approved of this opinion. This consecration by Varlet caused a theological controversy and schism within the Roman Church, which now possessed bishops who were validly consecrated without the permission of the pope. This schism marked the birth of the movement that would later be known as the Old Catholic Church (a term coined in 1853 for the Catholics of Utrecht), and it marked the beginning of an era in the Western Church, in which validly-consecrated bishops enjoyed apostolic succession but were not subject to the structures and strictures of the Roman Church. =First departure from the Roman Church= The sharing of apostolic succession in the west outside the Roman Church was largely confined to the Church of Utrecht for over a century. After the (First) Vatican Council in 1870, many Austro- Hungarian, German and Swiss Catholics rejected assertions of universal jurisdiction of the pope and the declaration of papal infallibility, and their bishops, inspired by earlier acts in Utrecht, decided to leave the Roman Catholic Church to form their own churches, independent of Rome. Now independent of the pope, these bishops were sometimes referred to as autocephalous (or self-governing) bishops or episcopi vaganti (wandering bishops). These validly-consecrated bishops enjoyed apostolic succession, and they continued to share valid lines of apostolic succession with the priests and deacons they ordained. In 1889, they formally united as part of the Utrecht Union of Churches (UU). =Episcopal consecrations by Arnold Harris Mathew= Bishop Arnold Harris Mathew (1852-1919) In 1908, the movement that would become Independent Catholicism left continental Europe when Arnold Harris Mathew (1852‚Äì1919), a former Catholic priest, was consecrated in Great Britain by Archbishop Gerardus Gul (1847‚Äì1920) of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands. Mathew believed that Old Catholicism might provide a home for disaffected Anglican clergy who reacted to Pope Leo XIII's declaration that Anglican orders were null and void, and Gul incorrectly believed that Mathew had a significant following in the United Kingdom. Two years later, in 1910, Mathew consecrated two priests to the episcopate, without clear reasons and without consulting the Archbishop of Utrecht, and, in response to the ensuing protest, declared his autonomy from the Old Catholic Church.Moss, pp. 301‚Äì4. Anson, pp. 180‚Äì81. Mathew later consecrated several other bishops who spread through England and North America. Plummer writes that, as a result, \\"we begin to see the small, endlessly multiplying groups, with a high percentage of the membership in holy orders, which came to characterize the independent movement.\\" From a historical perspective, one of Mathew's most important consecrations was of Frederick Samuel Willoughby, who in turn consecrated James Wedgwood, the co-founder in 1918 of the Liberal Catholic Church, an esoteric community closely aligned with the Theosophical Society and allowing complete freedom of belief. =Episcopal consecrations by Joseph Ren√© Vilatte= Joseph Ren√© Vilatte (1854‚Äì1929), an Old Catholic priest ordained by Bishop Eduard Herzog (1841-1924) of the Old Catholic Church in Switzerland,Old Catholic SourceBook - General info is credited with being the first person to bring to North America the movement that would result in Independent Catholicism. In 1892, Vilatte traveled to India, where he was consecrated, as Mar Timotheos, by Mar Julius I (1836-1923) of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. In 1915, Vilatte founded the American Catholic Church which still exists. During the following 28 years, Vilatte consecrated \\"a number of men who are the episcopal ancestors of an enormous variety of descendants\\" in North America. =Subsequent departures from the Roman Church= The 20th century has seen a number of clergy and laity move into the Independent Catholic movement, from the Roman Catholic Church. Czechoslovak Hussite Church Perhaps the largest departure from the Roman Church was the Czechoslovak Hussite Church (CHC), which organized on 8 January 1920, when several thousand priests and laypeople formed an independent church in response to their deep concerns over the Roman Church's opposition to modernism. The church's first patriarch was Karel Farsk√Ω (1880‚Äì1927), a modernist and former Catholic priest. The first bishops of the CHC were consecrated by priests through the laying on of hands. In 1931, Louis-Charles Winnaert (1880‚Äì1937), who was consecrated by Liberal Catholic bishop James Wedgwood (1883‚Äì1951), consecrated two CHC bishops, Gustav Proch√°zka (1872‚Äì1942) and Rostislav Stejskal (1894‚Äì1946), thus sharing apostolic succession with the CHC. The CHC ordained its first woman priest in 1947, and it consecrated its first woman bishop in 1999. According to the 2011 Czech Republic census, 39,276 people at that time self-identified as members of the CHC. Episcopal consecrations by Carlos Duarte Costa Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Duarte (left) at the episcopal consecration of Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez, at the Panama Canal Carlos Duarte Costa (1888-1961) was a Roman Catholic bishop in Brazil for twenty years before distancing himself, and being excommunicated by the Roman Church over his opposition to its position on clerical celibacy, divorce, vernacular liturgy, and his suspicions of the Roman Church's fascist sympathies during World War II. In 1945, Duarte Costa founded the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church and began consecrating numerous bishops in the apostolic succession. He is known as \\"St. Charles of Brazil\\" by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, which had grown to 560,781 members by 2010.\\"Tabela 2103 ‚Äì Popula√ß√£o residente, por situa√ß√£o do domic√≠lio, sexo, grupos de idade e religi√£o: Religi√£o = Cat√≥lica Apost√≥lica Brasileira\\".

Episcopal consecrations by Pierre Martin Ngo Dinh Thuc From 1975 until his death in 1984, exiled Roman Catholic Archbishop Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c (1897‚Äì1984) of Hu·∫ø, Vietnam, an older brother of Ngo Dinh Diem, the first president of South Vietnam, consecrated a number of bishops, first for the Palmarian Catholic Church, then for the sedevacantists of the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church. Th·ª•c also consecrated individuals unaffiliated to either of these groups such as Jean Laborie. In 1999, pop star Sin√©ad O'Connor was ordained a priest by Bishop Michael Cox (b. 1945) of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, whose lines of apostolic succession came through Archbishop Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c. Episcopal consecrations by Emmanuel Milingo Emmanuel Milingo (b. 1930) served as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lusaka, Zambia from 1969 to 1983. As such, he enjoyed valid lines of apostolic succession from the Roman Catholic Church, and, after departing from the Roman Church in 1983 over the issues of faith healing and clerical celibacy, he formed Married Priests Now! and consecrated four married priests as bishops: George Stallings of Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation, Peter Paul Brennan of the Old Catholic Confederation, Archbishop Patrick Trujillo of the Old Catholic Church in America, and Archbishop Joseph Gouthro of the Catholic Apostolic Church International. Since 2006, Milingo has performed at least four other consecrations. In 2013, Milingo, who still considers himself Catholic, retired from active ministry in the Ecumenical Catholic Apostolic Church of Peace. Appeal of Independent Catholicism to Catholic and Christian tradition Upon encountering Independent Catholicism for the first time, the questions of many individuals \\"are often historical: 'Where did this come from? Who ordained you? Did you invent this?'\\" Many Independent Catholics respond by emphasizing their tie to the larger Christian tradition of which they form part, the heritage they have received from larger, historic, mainstream churches, like the Roman Catholic Church, and their continuity of faith and ministry with those churches. Like Christians of the early Church, many see their efforts as \\"the seeds of a new kind of ministry that can adapt itself to the time and place of its exercise, the needs of the moment, and the people who are actually present in that particular place at that particular time. And yet is it so new? Is it not perhaps the very way that St. Paul set about spreading the Gospel and building the Church?\\"Bain, p. 16. Many Independent Catholic communities look to the past, seeking to create communities according to models provided by the New Testament (e.g., home- based fellowships led by volunteer clergy) and restoring various practices of the primitive Church,Plummer, p. 70. including the creation of an inclusive community and the honoring of the place of women and other marginalized persons within those communities. Many also find benchmarks for their current work in the annals of Christian history (e.g., the living of religious life, the sharing of various spiritual traditions, or the celebration of the Tridentine liturgy). Scams There have been situations of clergy claiming to be \\"Independent Catholic\\" practicing scams against unwary persons. They use a victim's Catholic faith to assert they are legitimate priests who can counsel and perform sacraments. The Catholic and Old Catholic churches frequently find themselves in a position of having to warn parishioners of these scams.https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/scammers-pose-pastors-email- ask-faithful-buy-gift-cardshttps://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/father- fraud/article_2ceb80ba-d256-55ca-97dd-054d3dc786e0.htmlhttps://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Gay- Priest-Convicted-of-Fraud-in-1992-117405433.html Independent Catholic beliefs and practices Virtually all members of the Independent Catholic movement possess \\"a deep commitment to the catholic (in the broadest possible sense) sacramental tradition\\"Plummer, p. 37. and worship according to a prescribed liturgy, usually derived from a mainstream Christian rite (like the Roman rite). Plummer suggests that \\"the most critical factor for independent sacramental identity is the single-minded focus on sacramental activity...[and that] very few independent communities offer coffee hour, Sunday School, and the array of other social programs which have come to characterize many mainstream churches.\\" Like the liturgies of early Christian community, the liturgies of Independent Catholic communities often vary widely, with each cleric or community making \\"its own choices of emphasis in terms of doctrine, liturgy, and other matters.\\" In practice, Independent Catholic polity is often essentially congregational. For the most part, Independent Catholic communities possess a sacramental and eucharistic spirituality, often mirroring the sacramental life and theology of the Roman Catholic Church. Most possess a mediatory priesthood and an historic episcopate, which are often the only constants amid diversity that ranges from extreme traditionalism to radical experimentation.Plummer, p. 128. Julie Byrne comments: \\"Independents vary widely, ranging from right to left in the political spectrum. On the right traditionalist churches practice versions of Catholicism more conservative than Rome. These include the Society of St. Pius X, founded by Marcel Lefebvre, as well as the Mount St. Michael's community in Spokane, Washington, and actor Mel Gibson's church in Malibu, California, which made headlines when he directed the movie, The Passion of the Christ in 2004. On the left stand groups such as the Church of Antioch, the Ecumenical Catholic Communion, and the White-Robed Monks of St. Benedict.\\"Julie Byrne, The Other Catholics: Remaking America's Largest Religion (Columbia University Press 2016), p. 4 While the Western Church and its theology have remained constant, despite changing clergy, Independent Catholicism often possesses another model in which \\"the priesthood remains constant, while the church it serves and the theology it teaches are often in a state of flux. While some western Christians may see this state of affairs as a distortion, it is nonetheless the centerpiece of the independent sacramental inheritance from the west.\\"Plummer, p. 25. Plummer says: \\"Independent sacramental Christians have given a unique primacy to the priesthood, carrying the 'priesthood of all believers' to an extent never before envisioned. In many such churches, most or all of the members are ordained, with ordination functioning more like [the sacrament of confirmation], rather than a professional credential. For better or worse, there is great freedom to create new church structures, new forms for the sacraments, and new theologies, or at least a new synthesis of inherited elements.\\" Many Independent Catholic communities are small, are led by an unpaid clergy, and lack a stable schedule or location. Larger Independent Catholic communities have often resulted from schism within the Roman Catholic Church or are often led by clergy who were formed by and formerly ministered to the Roman church; these communities often resemble mainstream churches with a larger population of laity and a small number of paid clergy. In Independent Catholicism, freelance ministries meeting the needs of a small number of persons are far more common than large parishes. While many Independent Catholic clergy and communities affirm the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed, with or without the filioque and with varying interpretations, they espouse a variety of doctrines and beliefs, ranging from neo-gnostic and theosophical beliefs allowing for \\"freedom in the interpretation of scriptures, creeds, and liturgies,\\"The Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church, p. 196. or the belief in no creed at all, to extremely traditional orthodox Catholic positions. Plummer says: \\"The nature of the movement makes it virtually impossible for there to ever be a unified theology\\" among Independent Catholics. Within the movement of Independent Catholicism, views vary widely on such issues as the ordination of women, homosexuality, divorce, issues of conscience, and other issues that are also controversial in other mainstream Catholic and Christian churches. Drawing from the ecumenical Christian tradition and other religious traditions, a growing number of Independent Catholic clergy and communities espouse a certain universalism, believing that God's loving embrace and forgiveness might be extended to all. Sometimes reaching beyond the bounds of the Christian tradition, some Independent Catholic clergy and communities feel greater liberty to incorporate into their lives and their worship a wide ranges of elements from other spiritual and religious traditions. Independent Catholic communities, often being quite small, tend to be internally fairly homogeneous on these and other issues, which means that divisions more often exist between different Independent Catholic communities, rather than within specific Independent Catholic communities. Plummer suggests the following categories for Independent Catholic communities: clergy who primarily celebrate alone, traditionalists with conservative theological commitments, churches maintaining traditional liturgy but with a different social or theological vision (e.g., full inclusion), groups with a particular focus on women's issues (e.g., the ordination of women) or the recovery of the Divine Feminine in worship, groups seeking liberal, non-dogmatic approaches to being church with little, if any, standards of dogmatic beliefs, and fellowships with an esoteric spirituality. Hundreds of websites are devoted to Independent Catholic jurisdictions and communities, some of which \\"seem to exist primarily in cyberspace\\". Others have no web presence at all.extract Autocephalous nature of Independent Catholicism Independent Catholic clergy do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church. Rather, the bishops of the Independent Catholic movement are autocephalous or self-governing. At present, there is no single unifying structure for the many clergy and laity who make up Independent Catholicism, and no reliable, centralized record- keeping. Independent Catholic communities are often small and extremely fluid.Plummer, p. 14. Various directories of Independent Catholic clergy have been attempted through the years, much of the information is provided by subjects, often with little verification, and most such directories contain hardly more than the quickly-outdated contact information of individual clerics, with little information on jurisdictions, communities, apostolic succession, and forms of worship. Importance of apostolic succession in Independent Catholicism The notion of apostolic succession (i.e., the ability of a bishop to trace spiritual ancestry through a purportedly unbroken line of bishops back to the original faith established by Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles) has played an important role in the history of the western Church since the Donatist controversy in the fourth and fifth centuries AD. The traditional Catholic position holds that a validly consecrated bishop shares apostolic succession with the bishops he consecrates and the priests and deacons he ordains regardless of any heresy or schism he may have committed. Some theologians argue that this view is mechanical and reductionist, and that episcopal consecration is for service within a specific Christian community; in this view, consecration or ordination of an individual with no reference to a community is without effect. Independent Catholic clergy reject this view, arguing that bishops are consecrated and priests and deacons ordained for the service of others, whether of a defined community or jurisdiction, or of a more broadly defined group. Independent Catholics tend to share the view that, \\"whatever else we may disagree about, we all believe earnestly in apostolic succession!\\" Many in the Independent Catholic movement who say they possess valid lines of apostolic succession received them from lines derived from Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Duarte Costa, Roman Catholic Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngo Dihn Thuc or Roman Catholic Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, who are seen within the movement as having validly, even if illicitly, consecrated and ordained individuals outside the Roman Catholic Church. While making no explicit statement about the validity or invalidity of consecrations and ordinations carried out in the Independent Catholic movement, the Roman Catholic Church suspended Roman Catholic Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngo Dihn Thuc, who had purportedly excommunicated himself by his latae sententiae act of consecrating other bishops and ordaining priests whom the Roman Church will not recognize. English translation: Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, \\"Decree concerning certain unlawful priestly and episcopal ordinations\\", 17 September 1976. The statement was repeated in a Notification of 12 March 1983. =Conditional consecrations and ordinations= Because the claim of apostolic succession has traditionally been viewed as a primary determinant of the validity of certain sacraments, some Independent Catholic clergy, particularly in the early days of the movement, underwent more than one ordination or consecration in order to be certain of having valid lines of apostolic succession. According to liturgical theology, these lines of apostolic succession are shared by bishops with the persons consecrated or ordained by them and, due to the indelible nature of the sacrament of holy orders, once ordained or consecrated, a person can never be ordained or consecrated again; nor can the orders be taken away. Subsequent ordinations and consecrations are considered \\"conditional\\" and without effect unless the recipient has previously received no valid ordination or consecration. These conditional consecrations and ordinations complicate conversations on the historical origins of the Independent Catholic movement and its communities. Plummer writes: \\"Many independent bishops have been consecrated multiple times, in an effort to ensure sacramental validity and consolidate claims to the historic episcopate. Such consecrations, in which literally dozens of 'lineages' can be transmitted from one bishop to another, only increase the difficulty of accurately describing the ancestry of any given group.\\" He says that this \\"crossbreeding of ecclesiastical lineage\\" has reached such a point that most Independent Catholic clergy share most or all of their heritage in common, even if this shared heritage has not contributed in any way toward jurisdictional unity. Independent Catholic clergy Independent Catholicism comprises a wide variety of clergy, many of whom are \\"primarily ritually focused\\"Plummer, p. 67. and possess \\"a particularly strong attachment to the liturgical aspect of being Christian.\\" Many Independent Catholic clergy and their communities are \\"those who have felt themselves excluded from the mainstream liturgical churches due to gender, sexuality, race, culture, style of worship...or theology.\\" Plummer says that within the Independent Sacramental Movement, which includes Independent Catholicism, \\"ordination is often open to a much larger percentage of the membership than in mainstream churches. Thus, those who want to become priests can generally do so. In the case of women and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons, there is a redemptive reversal in which those who were denied a public role in the church's sacramental life have assumed the previously forbidden place at the altar. Persons from ethnic or cultural minority groups who have been denied leadership positions, or who feel that their culture has been stifled, can work to more fully integrate their cultural identity and their faith....Thus, we have those who have been excluded from the church's sacramental life, for whatever reasons, taking ownership of the liturgical traditions, and creatively innovating to form new communities.\\". Outside of mainstream churches, Plummer says, such clergy \\"have often been accused of 'playing church.' Perhaps there is a grain of truth in that barb, as there is a touch of a playful attitude, when all these unlikely folks process into the church's sanctuary.\\" Independent Catholic clergy have been described as \\"often very attached to their individual views of theology, liturgy, and other matters...and would rather belong to minuscule groups which more closely approximate their vision of Christianity.\\" Plummer shares: \\"Many independent clergy, perhaps a majority, at least theoretically subscribe to fairly standard Catholic/Orthodox/Anglican theology, with few distinctive beyond, for instance, the rejection of papal infallibility. Most spent many years within those mainstream jurisdictions...[and now as independent Catholic clergy] they have often expended great energy in appearing 'real,' and 'just like' the larger liturgical churches, with only one or two adjustments.\\"Plummer, p. 69. Many Independent Catholic clergy are \\"essentially alone in their priestly practice\\" and exercise a primarily solitary vocation, with many of their family members and friends not even knowing of their clerical status. In line with Jesus' command to pray to God in secretMatthew 6:6. and with the monastic tradition of hermit priests (e.g., Catholic Carthusians) praying alone but in mystical union with the entire church and interceding for the entire world, much of their worship is performed in private. Plummer suggests: \\"A growing number of clergy are comfortable with private celebration, when a community is not available, or if they have discerned that their vocation is largely a hidden one....Private celebration is often grounded in a deep conviction of the objective reality and efficacy of the sacraments. From such a perspective, even a mass said in one's living room unknown to any other soul, is still a radiant gift to the world, and a powerful prayer for those held in mind and heart. On a less exalted level, private masses for those without a community enforce one's priestly identity, which may be outwardly expressed in less obvious ways.\\" Practically speaking, Plummer says, \\"viable independent communities are not always easily created, and these clergy would deprive themselves of the benefits of communion, and of the joining of themselves to Christ in his sacrifice, if they waited for the presence of others in order to approach the altar.\\" When engaged in ministry with others, Independent Catholic priests often see themselves as missionaries, freely sharing the grace of the Church's sacraments with those who may not regularly participate in a church community. Often volunteering their time in ministry, many Independent Catholic bishops, priests and deacons are a \\"working clergy\\" who support themselves and their ministries with jobs outside their ministries. As such, many often struggle to integrate their secular jobs and \\"ordinary\\" lives with their vocations and ministries. While all religious traditions contain examples of unhealthy individuals and of clergy misconduct,Plummer, p. 3. critics often draw attention to the personalities and idiosyncrasies of Independent Catholic clergy. Religious orders Similar to the Catholic Church, which possesses a rich tradition of varied religious orders, Independent Catholicism also consists of a diversity of religious communities. Most often, these communities and their jurisdictions resemble their Catholic counterparts. Some Independent Catholic religious communities are founded by and are exclusively for the members of particular jurisdictions; others are open to all who wish to live and grow in the spirituality of the religious community. Many religious communities within the Independent Catholic tradition are less structured than Catholic religious orders, with their members making certain vows (that may be interpreted differently than the traditional evangelical counsels), living a lifestyle in line with the spirituality of the tradition, and sharing the charism of their religious order with the world. Formation of clergy Apart from those members of the clergy who were formed within the seminary system of the Catholic Church or of a similar mainstream church, very few Independent Catholic clergy have received a formal theological education. Independent Catholic clergy \\"are not usually specialized professionals, but volunteers who hopefully know at least enough to celebrate the sacraments for themselves and those around them....Such radically different models of Christian priesthood raise questions of what sort of clergy training is needed, and offered within these communities.\\"Plummer, pp. 104-105. Plummer shares interviewee feedback suggesting that \\"the challenge of clergy training...was cited as the most important challenge facing the movement.\\"Plummer, p. 105. Resources for the formation and education of Independent Catholic clergy and seminarians are sparse, many Independent Catholic seminarians lack the financial and personal resources to be full-time seminarians, and many are not \\"willing to go to such lengths, and incur such debt [for a graduate degree], with no prospect of paid ministry.\\" Instead, many Independent Catholic seminarians work full-time at secular jobs and do not have the leisure to pursue full-time studies. Independent Catholic clergy have established a number of seminaries, most featuring distance learning or mentoring programs that vary considerably in quality, but very few of which grant legitimate degrees possess meaningful accreditation or could lead to a paycheck or a reasonably well-assured career path.Plummer, p. 120. More common is the mentoring and training of candidates by bishops and priests who have few if any clear guidelines or expectations for ordinands and instead adjust training requirements to meet the needs of the ordinand's vocation. Plummer concludes: \\"Mentoring will likely continue to be the primary means of clergy training in the Independent Sacramental Movement, due in part to the extremely flexible, anarchic nature of the movement, which works against the creation of formalized seminary programs.\\" The grace of God in the sacrament of Holy Orders is often freely shared within Independent Catholicism, thus leading to such characterizations as that of the young and ministerially-unprepared teenager whom poet Robert Kelly (b. 1935) says he once was: \\"A Unitarian I came into the world in Pride's Crossing, Massachusetts, and a Unitarian I shall leave it, notwithstanding my daily practice of certain Vedic sacrifices, my twenty-year long pursuit of ritual magic, the fact that I am technically a Muslim, and the more resplendent fact that I awoke from a teenage binge one day to find myself consecrated bishop of the Primitive Restored Old Catholic Church of North America.\\"http://www.lumen.org/intros/intro37.html, as cited in Plummer, p. 106. Plummer concludes: \\"It is very difficult to know what to do about such untrained clergy. Some provide themselves the training they did not receive from their bishop, and serve admirably well, perhaps better than some of their formally educated peers. Others are walking disasters, spiraling into psychological distortions that injure themselves and others, or ignoring their ordained status altogether.\\" Literature It has been pointed out that much of the writing (and liturgical books) concerning the Independent Catholic movement are self-published at best, and that they are often directed by Independent Catholic clergy toward other Independent Catholic clergy. It has been suggested that sustained theological reflection might one day come forward from clergy and communities with greater theological formation or from larger, more stable communities that have survived into their second or third generation. In the meantime, \\"as Independent clergy are most often volunteers with secular jobs, and little formal theological training, they lack both the time and the tools helpful to the development of a fully imagined theology.\\" Academic literature on Independent Catholicism has historically been relatively sparse and often not sympathetic to the movement.

Salt also co- starred in the 1993 motion picture Who's the Man?. In 1997, she recorded the song \\"Stomp\\" with gospel artists Kirk Franklin and God's Property for their album God's Property, one of the best-selling albums in gospel music history. They were the first female rap act to have gold, platinum, and multi-platinum albums, and the first female rap act to win a Grammy. The group disbanded in 2002 but reformed in 2008. James appeared on VH1's inaugural Hip Hop Honors program in November 2004, along with Pepa, but they did not perform. Salt, Pepa, and Spinderella, however, did perform on the second Hip Hop Honors on September 22, 2005, performing their hit \\"Whatta Man\\". This was the trio's first performance as Salt-N-Pepa since 1999. On October 23, 2008, Salt-N-Pepa performed \\"Shoop\\", \\"Push It\\", and \\"Whatta Man\\" at the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards.

James and her daughter are referenced in Tupac's song \\"Keep Ya Head Up.\\" In an interview James stated she considers herself a feminist \\"in a way,\\" emphasizing the need for women to avoid complete emotional and financial dependence on men. Songs like \\"Tramp\\" and \\"Shake Your Thang\\" by Salt-N-Pepa express such feminist themes as female autonomy. She was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church on a mission trip in Ethiopia with Oakwood College.

The two radio stations, and Channel 6 KHQ-TV, were owned by The Spokesman-Review, a daily newspaper in Spokane. At first, KHQ-FM simulcast the AM station, but it soon switched to an automated beautiful music format. In the early 1970s, KHQ-FM flipped to a Top 40 format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1975 page C-205 At first, the contemporary version of KHQ-FM was also largely automated, but over time, DJs were added. In the 1970s, most radios were still not able to receive FM signals, and Spokane already had two popular Top 40 stations, AM 790 KJRB and AM 970 KREM (now KTTO). At first, KHQ-FM was not much of a factor in the ratings. But as more listeners acquired FM radios, the station's ratings improved. Eventually, the AM stations switched to other formats. =KISC Debuts= In 1985, KHQ Incorporated decided to keep its TV station but sold off the radio stations to Lilac City Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-334 In those days, call signs could not be shared if the different stations were not co-owned. KHQ-TV kept its call letters, while the radio stations switched. The AM station became KLSN and the FM station became KISC, known as \\"Kiss-FM 98.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1986 page B-306 In 1984, former album rock station 92.9 KREM-FM became Top 40 KZZU. KISC and KZZU were locked in a battle as Spokane's two big Top 40 outlets on FM. As hard rock and rap music began to dominate the Top 40 charts, KISC shifted to Adult Top 40 and eventually to an upbeat Adult Contemporary format. KISC aired a popular locally based Love Notes request show like the Delilah love songs program they air today. In the 1990s, KISC would take pot shots at 99.9 KXLY-FM, which had made the transition from easy listening to soft adult contemporary. KISC accused KXLY-FM of playing too much \\"soft sleepy music.\\" When KXLY-FM flipped to Adult Alternative and then to Country music, KISC became Spokane's only mainstream adult contemporary station. In March 2020, KISC's HD2 sub-channel dropped \\"UP! 98.1 HD2\\" and adopted the country format of KZFS and the \\"Kix 99.3\\" branding (the frequency being in reference to FM translator 99.3 K257FX, with KISC-HD2 now being the primary relay station for it).

Released on their 1979 debut album, Unknown Pleasures, \\"She's Lost Control\\" was first performed live by the band in June 1978 and draws primary lyrical inspiration from a young woman experiencing a violent epileptic seizure.songfacts.com Two separate recordings of the song have been released: the version appearing on the band's debut album, and an extended, more electronic version was released in 1980 as a 12\\" single. This 12\\" single version contains an additional verse not present on the initial version of the song, and was recorded in March 1980 at Strawberry Studios, Stockport, making this song one of the last studio recordings recorded by the band prior to the May 1980 suicide of their lead singer, Ian Curtis. On the US release of the 12\\" single, \\"She's Lost Control\\" appeared as the A-side (with \\"Atmosphere\\" as the B-side), as opposed the UK version, where the song appeared as the B-side to \\"Atmosphere\\".joydivisiondata.co.uk Lyrical inspiration Curtis primarily drew the lyrical inspiration for \\"She's Lost Control\\" from a young woman with whom he had become acquainted through his employment as an Assistant Disablement Resettlement Officer at a Macclesfield occupational rehabilitation centre between 1978 and 1979.So This is Permanence: Joy Division Lyrics and Notebooks Ian Curtis, Deborah Curtis, Jon Savage (2014) p. xxii The woman had epilepsy and had been desperate to find employment, yet she suffered seizures whenever she came to the exchange, which would greatly disturb Curtis. At one stage, this young woman ceased attending her appointments at the occupational rehabilitation centre.Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures p. 70 Initially, Curtis assumed she had found a job, but he would later discover she had died of an epileptic seizure.A Smell of Burning: The Story of Epilepsy p. 63 Her unexpected death and Curtis's subsequent awareness and experiences of the stigma endured by individuals suffering from neurological impairments formed the lyrical inspiration for the song.Shakin' All Over: Popular Music and Disability p. 111The Oxford Handbook of Music and Disability Studies p. 238 Composition The composition of \\"She's Lost Control\\" centres upon Peter Hook's bassline, played high up on the neck, and a mechanistic drum beat played by Stephen Morris. For the song's recording, each drum was recorded completely separately, as producer Martin Hannett obsessively pursued clean drum sounds with no \\"bleed through\\" (when one drum's sound is added to the signal of another drum unintentionally) on songs he considered potential singles. Live, this song would be played at a faster pace than that upon the album, and much more aggressively, with Curtis often shouting the lyrics before the bridge sections. The syndrum used upon live performances of this song would often be more abrasive and louder in the mix than that used upon the studio recordings. On later live recordings, Curtis would play a keyboard line during the coda, one of only a few songs on which he would play an instrument.Shadowplayers: The Rise and Fall of Factory Records James Nice, Jon Savage (2011) p. 31 Live versions A number of live versions of the song appear on re-issues of the band's albums. In addition, the 2008 compilation release, The Best of Joy Division, includes the Peel session the band had recorded of this song in January 1979. Cover versions Many indie bands and artists have since covered \\"She's Lost Control\\". These artists include Girls Against Boys, Siobhan Fahey, Grace Jones and Spoek Mathambo. The guitar riff for \\"She's Lost Control\\" was also sampled in 1993 by the Manchester electronic music group 808 State for their single \\"Contrique\\". In popular culture A very loose cover version of the song, recorded by the Greek minimal wave band Alive She Died, featured prominently in a 2015 advertising campaign for the cruise/resort collection of the Italian fashion house, Gucci. The 2002 film 24 Hour Party People includes a scene dramatizing the recording of the song, and suggests that Morris recorded the drum beat on the roof of the studio, as well as continuing to play the beat long after the other band members had left the studio. The name of the song is referenced in the title of the 2007 Ian Curtis biopic Control, which includes the incident which inspired the song, and also the actual recording of the song. This later scene depicts drummer Stephen Morris using an aerosol can sprayed into a microphone as percussion. Notes References Further reading *Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division.

Prenatal development starts with fertilization, in the germinal stage of embryonic development, and continues in fetal development until birth. In human pregnancy, prenatal development is also called antenatal development. The development of the human embryo follows fertilization, and continues as fetal development. By the end of the tenth week of gestational age the embryo has acquired its basic form and is referred to as a fetus. The next period is that of fetal development where many organs become fully developed. This fetal period is described both topically (by organ) and chronologically (by time) with major occurrences being listed by gestational age. The very early stages of embryonic development are the same in all mammals. Later stages of development across all taxa of animals and the length of gestation vary. Terminology In the human: Stages during pregnancy. Embryonic development is marked in green. Weeks and months are numbered by gestation. Different terms are used to describe prenatal development, meaning development before birth. A term with the same meaning is the \\"antepartum\\" (from Latin ante \\"before\\" and parere \\"to give birth\\") Sometimes \\"antepartum\\" is however used to denote the period between the 24th/26th week of gestational age until birth, for example in antepartum hemorrhage.patient.info ¬ª PatientPlus ¬ª Antepartum Haemorrhage Last Updated: 5 May 2009The Royal Women‚Äôs Hospital > antepartum haemorrhage Retrieved on 13 Jan 2009 The perinatal period (from Greek peri, \\"about, around\\" and Latin nasci \\"to be born\\") is \\"around the time of birth\\".

Care of the Newborn. p. 7. Edition 7. Fertilization sperm cell fertilizing an egg cell. Fertilization marks the first germinal stage of embryonic development. When semen is released into the vagina, the spermatozoa travel through the cervix and body of the uterus and into the fallopian tubes where fertilization usually takes place. Many sperm cells are released with the possibility of just one managing to adhere to and enter the thick protective layer surrounding the egg cell (ovum). The first sperm cell to successfully penetrate the egg cell donates its genetic material (DNA) to combine with the DNA of the egg cell resulting in a new organism called the zygote. The term \\"conception\\" refers variably to either fertilization or to formation of the conceptus after its implantation in the uterus, and this terminology is controversial. The zygote will develop into a male if the egg is fertilized by a sperm that carries a Y chromosome, or a female if the sperm carries an X chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a gene, SRY, which will switch on androgen production at a later stage leading to the development of a male body type. In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA of the zygote comes entirely from the egg cell. Development of the embryo The initial stages of human embryogenesis. Following fertilization the embryonic stage of development continues until the end of the 10th week (gestational age) (8th week fertilization age). The first two weeks from fertilization is also referred to as the germinal stage or preembryonic stage. The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube dividing several times to form a ball of cells called a morula. Further cellular division is accompanied by the formation of a small cavity between the cells. This stage is called a blastocyst. Up to this point there is no growth in the overall size of the embryo, as it is confined within a glycoprotein shell, known as the zona pellucida. Instead, each division produces successively smaller cells. The blastocyst reaches the uterus at roughly the fifth day after fertilization. It is here that lysis of the zona pellucida occurs. This process is analogous to zona hatching, a term that refers to the emergence of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida, when incubated in vitro. This allows the trophectoderm cells of the blastocyst to come into contact with, and adhere to, the endometrial cells of the uterus. The trophectoderm will eventually give rise to extra- embryonic structures, such as the placenta and the membranes. The embryo becomes embedded in the endometrium in a process called implantation. In most successful pregnancies, the embryo implants 8 to 10 days after ovulation. The embryo, the extra-embryonic membranes, and the placenta are collectively referred to as a conceptus, or the \\"products of conception\\". Rapid growth occurs and the embryo's main features begin to take form. This process is called differentiation, which produces the varied cell types (such as blood cells, kidney cells, and nerve cells). A spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, in the first trimester of pregnancy is usually due to major genetic mistakes or abnormalities in the developing embryo. During this critical period (most of the first trimester), the developing embryo is also susceptible to toxic exposures, such as: * Alcohol, certain drugs, and other toxins that cause birth defects, such as fetal alcohol syndrome * Infection (such as rubella or cytomegalovirus) * Radiation from x-rays or radiation therapy * Nutritional deficiencies such as lack of folate which contributes to spina bifida =Nutrition= The embryo passes through 3 phases of acquisition of nutrition from the mother:Daftary, Shirish; Chakravarti, Sudip (2011). Manual of Obstetrics, 3rd Edition. Elsevier. pp. 1‚Äì16. . # Absorption phase: Zygote is nourished by cellular cytoplasm and secretions in fallopian tubes and uterine cavity. # Histoplasmic transfer: After nidation and before establishment of uteroplacental circulation, embryonic nutrition is derived from decidual cells and maternal blood pools that open up as a result of eroding activity of trophoblasts. # Hematotrophic phase: After third week of gestation, substances are transported passively via intervillous space. Development of the fetus Fetal development is the third of the three stages of prenatal development, following from the initial germinal stage (preembryonic stage), and stage of embryonic development. These stages are also referred to in pregnancy as terms or trimesters. From the 10th week of gestation (8th week of development), the developing organism is called a fetus. All major structures are already formed in the fetus, but they continue to grow and develop. Since the precursors of all the major organs are created by this time, the fetal period is described both by organ and by a list of changes by weeks of gestational age. Because the precursors of the organs are now formed, the fetus is not as sensitive to damage from environmental exposure as the embryo was. Instead, toxic exposure often causes physiological abnormalities or minor congenital malformation. =Development of organ systems= Development continues throughout the life of the fetus and through into life after birth. Significant changes occur to many systems in the period after birth as they adapt to life outside the uterus. Fetal blood Hematopoiesis first takes place in the yolk sac. The function is transferred to the liver by the 10th week of gestation and to the spleen and bone marrow beyond that. The total blood volume is about 125 ml/kg of fetal body weight near term. Red blood cells Megaloblastic red blood cells are produced early in development, which become normoblastic near term. Life span of prenatal RBCs is 80 days. Rh antigen appears at about 40 days of gestation. White blood cells The fetus starts producing leukocytes at 2 months gestational age, mainly from the thymus and the spleen. Lymphocytes derived from the thymus are called T lymphocytes (T cells), whereas those derived from bone marrow are called B lymphocytes (B cells). Both of these populations of lymphocytes have short-lived and long-lived groups. Short-lived T cells usually reside in thymus, bone marrow and spleen; whereas long-lived T cells reside in the blood stream. Plasma cells are derived from B cells and their life in fetal blood is 0.5 to 2 days. Glands The thyroid is the first gland to develop in the embryo at the 4th week of gestation. Insulin secretion in the fetus starts around the 12th week of gestation. Cognitive development Initial knowledge of the effects of prenatal experience on later neuropsychological development originates from the Dutch Famine Study, which researched the cognitive development of individuals born after the Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì45.Henrichs, J. (2010). Prenatal determinants of early behavioral and cognitive development: The generation R study. Rotteram: Erasmus Universiteit. The first studies focused on the consequences of the famine to cognitive development, including the prevalence of intellectual disability.Stein, Z., Susser, M., Saenger, G., & Marolla, F. (1972). Nutrition and mental performance. Science, 178(62),708-713. Such studies predate David Barker's hypothesis about the association between the prenatal environment and the development of chronic conditions later in life.Barker, D. J., Winter, P. D., Osmond, C., Margetts, B., & Simmonds, S. J. (1989). Weight in infancy and death from ischaemic heart disease. Lancet, 2(8663), 577-580. The initial studies found no association between malnourishment and cognitive development, but later studies found associations between malnourishment and increased risk for schizophrenia,Brown, A., Susser, E., Hoek, H., Neugebauer, R., Lin, S., & Gorman, J. (1996). Schizophrenia and affective disorders after prenatal famine. Biological Psychiatry, 39(7), 551. doi:10.1016/0006-3223(96)84122-9 antisocial disorders,Neugebauer, R., Hoek, H. W., & Susser, E. (1999). Prenatal exposure to wartime famine and development of antisocial personality disorder in early adulthood. Jama, 282(5), 455-462. and affective disorders.Brown, A. S., van Os, J., Driessens, C., Hoek, H. W., & Susser, E. S. (2000). Further evidence of relation between prenatal famine and major affective disorder. American Journal of Psychiatry, 157(2), 190-195. There is evidence that the acquisition of language begins in the prenatal stage. After 26 weeks of gestation, the peripheral auditory system is already fully formed.Eisenberg, R. B. (1976). Auditory Competence in Early Life: The Roots of Communicate Behavior Baltimore: University Park Press. Also, most low- frequency sounds (less than 300 Hz) can reach the fetal inner ear in the womb of mammals.Gerhardt, K. J., Otto, R., Abrams, R. M., Colle, J. J., Burchfield, D. J., and Peters, A. J. M. (1992). Cochlear microphones recorded from fetal and newborn sheep. Am. J. Otolaryngol. 13, 226‚Äì233. Those low-frequency sounds include pitch, rhythm, and phonetic information related to language.Lecaneut, J. P., and Granier-Deferre, C. (1993). \\"Speech stimuli in the fetal environment\\", in Developmental Neurocognition: Speech and Face Processing in the First Year of Life, eds B. De Boysson-Bardies, S. de Schonen, P. Jusczyk, P. MacNeilage, and J. Morton (Norwell, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishing), 237‚Äì248. Studies have indicated that fetuses react to and recognize differences between sounds.Kisilevsky, B. S., Hains, S. M. J., Lee, K., Xie, X., Ye, H. H., Zhang, K., and Wang, Z. (2003). Effects of experience on fetal voice recognition. Psychol. Sci. 14, 220‚Äì224. Such ideas are further reinforced by the fact that newborns present a preference for their mother's voice,DeCasper, A. J., and Fifer, W. P. (1980). Of human bonding: newborns prefer their mother's voices. Science 208, 1174‚Äì1176. present behavioral recognition of stories only heard during gestation,DeCasper, A. J., and Spence, M. J. (1986). Prenatal maternal speech influences newborns' perception of speech sounds. Infant Behav. Dev. 9, 133‚Äì150. and (in monolingual mothers) present preference for their native language.Moon, C., Cooper, R. P., and Fifer, W. P. (1993). Two-day-olds prefer their native language. Infant Behav. Dev. 16, 495‚Äì500. A more recent study with EEG demonstrated different brain activation in newborns hearing their native language compared to when they were presented with a different language, further supporting the idea that language learning starts while in gestation.May, L., Byers-Heinlein, K., Gervain, J., & Werker, J. F. (2011). Language and the Newborn Brain: Does Prenatal Language Experience Shape the Neonate Neural Response to Speech? Frontiers in Psychology, 2. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00222 Growth rate Growth rate of fetus is linear up to 37 weeks of gestation, after which it plateaus. The growth rate of an embryo and infant can be reflected as the weight per gestational age, and is often given as the weight put in relation to what would be expected by the gestational age. A baby born within the normal range of weight for that gestational age is known as appropriate for gestational age (AGA). An abnormally slow growth rate results in the infant being small for gestational age, and, on the other hand, an abnormally large growth rate results in the infant being large for gestational age. A slow growth rate and preterm birth are the two factors that can cause a low birth weight. Low birth weight (below 2000 grams) can slightly increase the likelihood of schizophrenia. The growth rate can be roughly correlated with the fundal height which can be estimated by abdominal palpation. More exact measurements can be performed with obstetric ultrasonography. Factors influencing development Intrauterine growth restriction is one of the causes of low birth weight associated with over half of neonatal deaths. = Poverty = Poverty has been linked to poor prenatal care and has been an influence on prenatal development. Women in poverty are more likely to have children at a younger age, which results in low birth weight. Many of these expecting mothers have little education and are therefore less aware of the risks of smoking, drinking alcohol, and drug use other factors that influence the growth rate of a fetus. = Mother's age = Women between the ages of 16 and 35 have a healthier environment for a fetus than women under 16 or over 35. Women between this age gap are more likely to have fewer complications. Women over 35 are more inclined to have a longer labor period, which could potentially result in death of the mother or fetus. Women under 16 and over 35 have a higher risk of preterm labor (premature baby), and this risk increases for women in poverty, women who take drugs, and women who smoke. Young mothers are more likely to engage in high risk behaviors, such as using alcohol, drugs, or smoking, resulting in negative consequences for the fetus. Premature babies from young mothers are more likely to have neurological defects that will influence their coping capabilities irritability, trouble sleeping, constant crying for example. There is a risk of Down syndrome for infants born to those aged over 40 years. Young teenaged mothers (younger than 16) and mothers over 35 are more exposed to the risks of miscarriages, premature births, and birth defects. = Drug use = An estimated 5 percent of fetuses in the United States are exposed to illicit drug use during pregnancy. Maternal drug use occurs when drugs ingested by the pregnant woman are metabolized in the placenta and then transmitted to the fetus. Cannabis When using cannabis, there is a greater risk of birth defects, low birth weight, and a higher rate of death in infants or stillbirths. Drug use will influence extreme irritability, crying, and risk for SIDS once the fetus is born. Marijuana will slow the fetal growth rate and can result in premature delivery. It can also lead to low birth weight, a shortened gestational period and complications in delivery. Opioids Opioids including heroin will cause interrupted fetal development, stillbirths, and can lead to numerous birth defects. Heroin can also result in premature delivery, creates a higher risk of miscarriages, result in facial abnormalities and head size, and create gastrointestinal abnormalities in the fetus. There is an increased risk for SIDS, dysfunction in the central nervous system, and neurological dysfunctions including tremors, sleep problems, and seizures. The fetus is also put at a great risk for low birth weight and respiratory problems. Cocaine Cocaine use results in a smaller brain, which results in learning disabilities for the fetus. Cocaine puts the fetus at a higher risk of being stillborn or premature. Cocaine use also results in low birthweight, damage to the central nervous system, and motor dysfunction. Methamphetamine Prenatal methamphetamine exposure has shown to negatively impact brain development and behavioral functioning. A 2019 study further investigated neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure. This study had two groups, one containing children who were prenatally exposed to methamphetamine but no other illicit drugs and one containing children who met diagnosis criteria for ADHD but were not prenatally exposed to any illicit substance. Both groups of children completed intelligence measures to compute an IQ. Study results showed that the prenatally exposed children performed lower on the intelligence measures than their non-exposed peers with ADHD. The study results also suggest that prenatal exposure to methamphetamine may negatively impact processing speed as children develop.Brinker, M. J., Cohen, J. G., Sharrette, J. A., & Hall, T. A. (2019). Neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal methamphetamine exposure: A comparison study of prenatally exposed children with nonexposed ADHD peers. Applied Neuropsychology: Child, 8(2), 132-139. doi:10.1080/21622965.2017.1401479 = Alcohol = Maternal alcohol use leads to disruptions of the fetus's brain development, interferes with the fetus's cell development and organization, and affects the maturation of the central nervous system. Even small amounts of alcohol use can cause lower height, weight and head size at birth and higher aggressiveness and lower intelligence during childhood. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that is a consequence of heavy alcohol intake by the mother during pregnancy. Children with FASD have a variety of distinctive facial features, heart problems, and cognitive problems such as developmental disabilities, attention difficulties, and memory deficits. =Tobacco use= Tobacco smoking during pregnancy exposes the fetus to nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide. Nicotine results in less blood flow to the fetus because it constricts the blood vessels. Carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen flow to the fetus. The reduction of blood and oxygen flow may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, and premature births. Exposure to secondhand smoke leads to higher risks of low birth weight and childhood cancer. = Infections = If a mother is infected with a disease, the placenta cannot always filter out the pathogens. Viruses such as rubella, chicken pox, mumps, herpes, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, prematurity, physical malformations, and intellectual disabilities. HIV can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Untreated HIV carries a risk of between 10 and 20 per cent of being passed on to the fetus. Bacterial or parasitic diseases may also be passed on to the fetus, and include chlamydia, syphilis, tuberculosis, malaria, and commonly toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis can be acquired through eating infected undercooked meat or contaminated food, and by drinking contaminated water. The risk of fetal infection is lowest during early pregnancy, and highest during the third trimester. However, in early pregnancy the outcome is worse, and can be fatal. = Maternal nutrition = Adequate nutrition is needed for a healthy fetus. Mothers who gain less than 20 pounds during pregnancy are at increased risk for having a preterm or low birth weight infant. Iron and iodine are especially important during prenatal development. Mothers who are deficient in iron are at risk for having a preterm or low birth weight infant. Iodine deficiencies increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and fetal brain abnormalities Adequate prenatal care gives an improved result in the newborn. = Low birth weight = Low birth weight increases an infants risk of long-term growth and cognitive and language deficits. It also results in a shortened gestational period and can lead to prenatal complications. = Stress = Stress during pregnancy can impact the development of the embryo. Reilly (2017) states that stress can come from many forms of life events such as community, family, financial issues, and natural causes. While a woman is pregnant, stress from outside sources can take a toll on the growth in the womb that may affect the child's learning and relationships when born. For instance, they may have behavioral problems and might be antisocial. The stress that the mother experiences affects the fetus and the fetus' growth which can include the fetus' nervous system (Reilly, 2017). Stress can also lead to low birth weight. Even after avoiding other factors like alcohol, drugs, and being healthy, stress can have its impacts whether families know it or not. Many women who deal with maternal stress do not seek treatment. Similar to stress, Reilly stated that in recent studies, researchers have found that pregnant women who show depressive symptoms are not as attached and bonded to their child while it is in the womb (2017). = Environmental toxins = Exposure to environmental toxins in pregnancy lead to higher rates of miscarriage, sterility, and birth defects. Toxins include fetal exposure to lead, mercury, and ethanol or hazardous environments. Prenatal exposure to mercury may lead to physical deformation, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and poor motoric coordination. Exposure to high levels of lead prenatally is related to prematurity, low birth weight, brain damage, and a variety of physical defects. Exposure to persistent air pollution from traffic and smog may lead to reduced infant head size, low birth weight, increased infant death rates, impaired lung and immune system development.

In May 2011, Ameglio helped to organize demonstrations in support of survivor and victim rights related to ongoing violence in Mexico following the death of Juan Francisco Sicilia Ortega, the son of Javier Sicilia, bringing hundreds of thousands of people together across Mexico and in 17 countries around the world. A practitioner of Gandhian methodology, Ameglio's philosophy is to tap the positive values and moral sensibilities of Mexican culture which can be marshaled to oppose war and to change the model of \\"Armed Peace\\" to a model of \\"Peace with Justice.\\" This combination of practical and formal peace work has led Pietro Ameglio to be described as \\"one of the most important teachers and practitioners of active nonviolence in Latin America today.\\" Pietro Ameglio has been selected as the 2014 winner of the El-Hibri Peace Education Prize, the eighth annual Laureate to be selected. Civil Resistance and Nonviolent Activism Over the last 25 years, Ameglio has facilitated peace education and promoted nonviolent direct action strategies in Mexico and Latin America. In 1987, Ameglio co- founded the Mexican chapter of the Peace and Justice Service (Servicio Paz y Justicia, or SERPAJ), a Latin American peace network spanning 12 countries and established by Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel. Ameglio has worked with poor communities throughout Mexico to promote nonviolent culture, human rights, and peace education. Some of his work includes organizing a number of vehicles for peace in Mexico; including Thinking Out Loud (Pensar en Voz Alta, 1995), a Gandhian-inspired nonviolent action collective; and the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity (MPJD, 2011), founded by the poet Javier Sicilia and the families of dead and missing persons.\\"Mexico Nonviolence Movement.\\" Integrities. Apr. 11, 2014. http://www.integrities.org/pietro-ameglios-letter-august-2012.html May 2011 National March for Peace with Justice and Dignity Drawing on Gandhian strategy, Ameglio helped organize some of the largest mass civic actions against violence and war in Mexico. Ameglio, along with close collaborator Javier Sicilia, served as a main organizer of the National March for Peace with Justice and Dignity in May 2011.\\"Mexico Nonviolence Movement.\\" Integrities. May 18, 2014. http://www.integrities.org/nonviolence-in- mexico.html After the death of Sicilia's son on March 28, a cry for social justice was launched under the slogan \\"We've had it up to here!\\" ( \\"¬°Estoy hasta la madre!\\"), demanding an end to violence and state complicity in escalating militarism.\\"Mexico Nonviolence Movement.\\" Integrities. http://www.integrities.org/nonviolence-in-mexico.html. Ameglio organized an 85-kilometer \\"Silent March\\" for survivors and victims of drug-related violence whose suffering had largely been ignored by the public. Between 15,000 and 25,000 protesters joined this four-day march from Cuernavaca to Z√≥calo (the main plaza in Mexico City) where 200,000 people gathered to listen to their testimony. The protestors also called for an alternative approach to Mexico‚Äôs ‚Äúwar strategy‚Äù in the escalating war on drugs. Over the four day march for peace with justice, thousands of protestors signed a ‚ÄúSocial Pact‚Äù calling for the government to enact reforms to bring truth and justice, end the war on drugs, fight corruption and impunity, combat poverty and the crime-based economy, implement economic policies to help the youth, and democratize politics and the media. The movement called for autonomous bodies of peace rather than just a call for dialogue with the government, and represented a radical change from a ‚Äúwar strategy‚Äù to one of citizen security with respect for human rights. The agreement was signed by civil society organizations on June 10 in Ciudad Juarez.\\"MEXICO: Four-Day March for 'Peace with Justice' Calls for Social Pact.\\" Global Issues. May 9, 2011. http://www.globalissues.org/news/2011/05/09/9575. The movement spurred related protests in 31 Mexican cities and 17 cities across the globe to oppose violence and recognize the dignity of survivors and victims. The largest protest took place in San Cristobal de Las Casas, in the southern State of Chiapas, where 5,000 members of the left-wing Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) expressed support for the movement, solidarity with victims, and opposition to the armed forces fighting the war on drugs. Following up on the May 2011 protests, Ameglio worked with the MPJD to create the ‚ÄúCaravan of Consolation‚Äù (June 2011) and the ‚ÄúCaravan to the South‚Äù (September 2011), which traveled through the areas of northern and southern of Mexico, the hardest hit by the violence. The caravans provided a platform for victims‚Äô families to speak out, to connect with the Movement of Peace and human rights groups, and to become active in the struggle for victims‚Äô rights, and to stop terror. In 2011, he played a key role in organizing a two-day public fast and bi-national encounter in Juarez on the US-Texas border when it was the epicenter of the violence. Prior to this, Ameglio had organized nonviolent direct action outside of military bases (the first of their kind in Mexico) and civil disobedience in defense of the rights of street vendors in Cuernavaca. As a member of SERPAJ-Morelos and the Latin American Council of Peace Research (CLAIP), Ameglio defended the rights of environmentalists, helping to organize a national ecological civil resistance struggle to save the Casino de la Selva park space in Cuernavaca in the face of a Costco construction project (2001-2004), resulting in his arrest and incarceration as a prisoner of conscience. He has extensive experience in practicing nonviolence with direct actions in Bosnia with ‚ÄúMir Sada‚Äù (1993) and in Chiapas conflict zones (1994-2006) working with peace camps, solidarity caravans, and human rights denunciations.\\"Mexico Nonviolence Movement.\\" Integrities. April 11, 2014. http://www.integrities.org/pietro-ameglios- letter-august-2012.html. Peace Education Born in Uruguay and educated in M√©xico, Ameglio completed his undergraduate studies in History at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and earned a Master‚Äôs in Contemporary History at the Autonomous University of Morelos (UAEM). Ameglio served 18 years as Chair of the Humanities Department at La Salle University in Cuernavaca. Ameglio has held both the Henry D. Thoreau Special Chair and the Spanish Exile Masters ‚Äì Due Disobedience Special Chair (2008-2014) within the School of Philosophy and Literature at National Autonomous University (UNAM) in Mexico City. He teaches classes on ‚ÄúPeace Pedagogy‚Äù, ‚ÄúCivil Resistance‚Äù and ‚ÄúTechniques of Nonviolence‚Äù at the UNAM and the Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana. These courses combine peace and nonviolence culture from Gandhi, Thich Nhat Hanh, Donald Hessler, Nelson Mandela, and the Zapatistas. Ameglio uses a methodology of constructing knowledge that draws on Jean Piaget and Juan Carlos Mar√≠n. In the spirit of Gandhi‚Äôs ‚Äúconstruction program,‚Äù Ameglio has collaborated with indigenous education promoters in the autonomous territories of Chiapas to develop curricula that include their cultural and artistic expressions, as well as their history of social and political struggle. This curriculum is now taught within the Zapatista autonomous school system. Ameglio is the founder and member of ‚ÄúThinking Out loud‚Äù, or Pensar en Voz Alta (SERPAJ-PICASO), a Gandhian research collaborative that compiles, analyzes and publicizes statistical information on the nature of social conflict in Mexico. SERPAJ-PICASO also promotes nonviolent direct actions through peace camps and anti-militarism protests, and engages the public through expositions about Gandhi and militarism in Mexico. The expositions cover different forms of exclusion, discrimination, violence, and repression of social movements that affect society, especially indigenous groups. Ameglio also co-founded, with an ecumenical community in 1991, an alternative school called Walking Together in Cuernavaca for children who live or work on the streets to build community solidarity and study to create more human alternatives for their future lives. Ameglio is committed to engaging youth more directly in peace education and nonviolent activism. In 2014, he co- founded the Peace and Nonviolence Team with students in the Philosophy Department at the UNAM. Pietro is a frequent contributor to conferences, newspapers and magazines, and is author of Gandhi y la desobediencia civil: Mexico hoy (Gandhi and civil disobedience.

The area is roughly bounded by the Dallow Downs to the north and north-east, Stockwood Park to the south, the M1 to the west, and Wilsden Avenue and Bolingbroke Road to the east. History In the late 12th century a 'hospital' was built on the Stockwood Estate in Farley Hill. This old hospital was partly renovated and extended to house a museum that holds the 'Mossman Collection', a large collection of horsedrawn carriages and other vehicles, along with locally found artifacts, a historical garden and a craft center. The estate was constructed after World War II to replace houses destroyed by German bombers. The design of the estate primarily consists of residential housing, which was considered advanced at the time of its construction, incorporating a shopping precinct in the centre of a large roundabout and a wide avenue stretching from the centre to the edge of Stockwood Park. Farley Hill is served by two Junior schools, St Margaret Of Scotland Roman Catholic which opened in 1960 to serve the large, mainly Irish, Roman Catholic population and Farley Juniors which opened in 1952. A single secondary school, Rotheram Senior School existed until 1988 but dwindling numbers and government funding restrictions led to its amalgamation with Stockwood High School into South Luton High School on Cutenhoe Road. The school then converted to academy status in 2007, and it was renamed Barnfield South Academy as part of the Barnfield Federation. In 2011, the school moved to a new ¬£30 million building situated on the old playing field of the former Rotheram High School site. In 2015 the school changed its name to South Academy and became part of The Shared Learning Trust. In 2016 it was renamed as Stockwood Park Academy. A view of Luton can be seen from the top of the Dallow Hills which are situated on the outskirts of the estate. The area is next to Stockwood Park, which contains the Mossman Collection, Stockwood Museum, gardens, playing fields and 3 par golf course.  Politics  The Farley ward is represented by Cllr Paul Castleman (Labour), Cllr Mahmood Hussain (Labour) and Cllr Sian Timoney (Labour). The ward forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Luton South, and the MP is Rachel Hopkins.

Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. He was a veteran of the Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. Almonte was also a leader of Mexico's Conservatives in the 1860s and served as regent after the Second Mexican Empire was established by Napoleon III of France. Early life Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, the father of Almonte. Almonte was born in the town of Car√°cuaro in the state of Michoac√°n. He was the son of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, a Roman Catholic priest who led the insurgents in the Mexican War of Independence from 1811 to 1815, and Br√≠gida Almonte.Virginia Guedea, \\"Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p. 948.Todish et al. (1998), p. 113. His mother, Br√≠gida Almonte, was said to be of pure Amerindian ancestry. In 1815 Morelos sent Almonte to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was educated and learned fluent English. At his trial, Morelos was accused by the Mexican Inquisition following his capture that he had sent his son there to learn the doctrines of \\"heretical maxims of Protestantism,\\" to which Morelos responded he sent his son there because of his concern about his son's safety in Mexico.Christon I. Archer, \\"Death's Patriots--Celebration, Denunciation, and Memories of Mexico's Independence Heroes\\" in Death, Dismemberment, and Memory: Body Politics in Latin America, Lyman L. Johnson, ed. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2004, p. 78. While in New Orleans, Almonte worked as a clerk for hardware merchant Puech & Bein. His time in the United States was cut short when his father was executed on December 22, 1815 in the village of San Crist√≥bal Ecatepec. Between 1822 and 1824, Almonte was on the staff of insurgent rebel leader Jos√© F√©lix Trespalacios in Texas and then was sent as a part of the Mexican delegation to London. Almonte assisted Ambassador Jos√© Mariano Michelena in negotiating a commercial and amity treaty with England. This was Mexico's first treaty as a new nation. In 1830, while serving in Mexican Congress, Almonte became an object of government attention as editor of \\"El Atleta\\". He accused President Anastasio Bustamante of allowing foreign intervention in national affairs. Because of his stance, Almonte's arrest was ordered on April 16, 1830. He was forced to seek refuge in New Orleans due to government pressure, and the paper collapsed due to heavy fines levied by Bustamante‚Äôs government. Later, Bustamante relented and appointed Almonte secretary of the Mexican Legation Extraordinary in 1831. His new job was to represent Mexico in the Republics of South America and the Empire of Brazil. Almonte married Mar√≠a Dolores Quesada on March 1, 1840 in Mexico City and they had a daughter named Mar√≠a de Guadalupe Anastacia Aleja Br√≠gida Saturnina. Texas Revolution Mexican General Juan Nepomuceno Almonte. In 1834 Vice President Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as appointed Almonte and Col. Jos√© Mar√≠a D√≠az Noriega to make an inspection tour of Texas and write a status report on what they witnessed. In late January 1836 Almonte was appointed aide-de-camp to Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna and accompanied him to Texas in an attempt to quell the rebellion there. Santa Anna led his army directly for San Antonio de Bexar, where a small group of Texians was garrisoned at the former Alamo Mission. As the Mexican army occupied the city, Texian co-commander James Bowie sent Green B. Jameson to speak with Santa Anna. Instead, Jameson met with Almonte. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional.Todish et al. (1998), pp. 40‚Äì41. In his March 6 journal entry after the battle, Mexican Almonte listed the Texian casualty toll as 250, with the survivors being five women, one Mexican soldier and one slave. Almonte did not record the names of either the defenders or the survivors, and his count was based solely on who was there during the final assault.Almonte, Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 374,377 Almonte is said to have had the role in saving Susannah Dickinson. According to some interviews she gave, a Mexican officer intervened to spare her and her daughter's life. This officer was presumed to be either an English mercenary named Black, or Almonte. Then, she said she was taken before Santa Anna, who was talked out of imprisoning her by Almonte. On April 21, 1836, Almonte, at the head of part of the Guerrero battalion, surrendered to Texian Thomas J. Rusk at the Battle of San Jacinto. Almonte led the last organized resistance of the panicked army. On the following day Santa Anna also was taken prisoner. Almonte stayed with Santa Anna during his imprisonment acting as interpreter and negotiator. Almonte accompanied Santa Anna during his incarceration on Galveston Island. Then they were taken up the Brazos river to the Phelps plantation, about 30 miles from Velasco, and kept there during the summer and autumn of 1836. While staying there the rumors spread that there were plans to rescue the prisoners. When an escape plot was later discovered, Almonte and Santa Anna were each forced to wear a heavy ball and chain for 52 and 53 days respectively. Finally, through the efforts of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston, Almonte, accompanied by Texas Vice-President Lorenzo de Zavala and Bailey Hardeman was sent along with Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., where they had several meetings with U.S. President Andrew Jackson. After eight days in Washington, they left the U.S. on January 31, 1837. The party returned to Mexico in February. By then, Santa Anna had been replaced as President of Mexico and went into retirement. Almonte, though, continued his diplomatic and military career and eventually rose to the rank of major general. He published a book on geography in late 1837. Political life =Service in the government of Santa Anna= Juan Almonte in full military regalia. In January 1838, Almonte became a member of the Junta Directiva, which governed the Normal School of the Army. In March 1838 he was appointed secretary of the Mexican legation to London. In June 1839 Almonte headed the Mexican legation to Belgium. From July 1839 to October 1841, he was secretary of war and marine under President Bustamante. Almonte was later appointed minister plenipotentiary to Washington in 1841-1845 under President Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera. With the annexation of the Republic of Texas to the United States, Almonte packed his bags on March 6 and returned to Mexico via Veracruz. Almonte favored the installation of Gen. Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga at this time. But while stopping in Havana as minister to France, Almonte re-joined forces with the exiled former president and general Santa Anna and together they traveled back to Mexico. When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, Jos√© Mariano Salas was ad interim president for Santa Anna and Almonte served as Secretary of War until he was replaced with Valent√≠n Canalizo. In February 1847 Almonte and a few other Mexican generals tried to oust G√≥mez Far√≠as from power, but failed. They were arrested and jailed for a time in the convent of Santiago Tlatelolco. After the war, Almonte served as senator from Oaxaca for four years, then served as Mexico's representative to the U.S. under President Santa Anna (his last time as president). =Opposition to liberal reform, promotion of monarchy= Miramar Castle in Trieste, Italy. After the ouster of Santa Anna in 1855, Mexican liberals came to power and began to implement their vision of Mexico through changes in law and ultimately the writing of a new constitution in 1857. The Constitution of 1857, established February 5, 1857, codified major changes, especially the separation of church and state. Mexican conservatives refused to swear fealty to the new constitution and set up a parallel government under general F√©lix Zuloaga and precipitated the War of the Reform (or Three Years' War). During this period, General Almonte was named special emissary to Spain to deal with outstanding bilateral issues between the two countries. While in Europe, he sought European powers' intervention in Mexico, concerned that the turmoil would be disastrous for the country. \\"Unless we can persuade some European power to aid us in establishing some stable government, it is inevitable that the whole of Mexico must be swallowed up by the United States.\\"Almonte quoted in Carl H. Bock, Prelude to Tragedy: The Negotiation and Breakdown of the Tripartite Convention of London, October 31, 1861. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press 1966, p. 41. Almonte was a signatory of the Mon-Almonte Treaty with Spain in 1859, which ended a period of suspension of diplomatic relations between Spain and Mexico over a debt dispute.Ralph Roeder, Ju√°rez and His Mexico. New York: The Viking Press 1947, pp. 220-221. The treaty saw Mexico pay debts to the Spaniards in exchange for economic aid against the Mexican Liberals. Once overseas, Almonte became involved in the promotion of foreign intervention and monarchical plans for Mexico. His machinations culminated in the French intervention in Mexico. In Paris, with Jos√© Hidalgo and Jos√© Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez de Estrada, an expatriate expelled from Mexico for advocating monarchy, Almonte sought supporters for a new monarchy in Mexico.Roeder, Ju√°rez and his Mexico, p. 329. He was also appointed lieutenant of the empire by Maximilian in April 1864, and some weeks later marshal of the empire. He adhered to the fortunes of his imperial patron throughout his short reign, and, when Maximilian was executed, he fled to Europe, spending his last days in exile. Honours The town of Almonte, Ontario was named for General Almonte when Canada as well as Mexico were concerned with United States expansionism.Cosentino, Frank.

She gained considerable popularity in the late 1990s for playing Mimi Bobeck, the outrageously made-up, flamboyantly vulgar, and vindictive nemesis of Drew Carey on the sitcom The Drew Carey Show. She had been involved in television, feature film, and stage work for years. Biography =Early life= Kinney was born in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, the daughter of Irish American parents Marian and Harold Kinney, an automobile dealer.Kathy Kinney Biography, filmreference.com; accessed January 5,m 2018.Kathy Kinney: See About Mimi, tripod.com; accessed January 5, 2018. Her father died when she was 15 years old. After high school, Kathy Kinney worked for the California Conservation Corps between 1972 and 1974. After completing a six-month Back Country season in Kings Canyon, she left the program with thousands of dollars in scholarships. She attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point in the 70‚Äôs and officially received her degree in 2016. Kathy Kinney Biography - Yahoo! Movies In 1976 she moved to New York City, where she found work as a secretary at WCBS-TV. Her boss enjoyed hunting, and sometimes she chatted with him about his hunting trips, occasionally quipping, \\"So, did you kill anything this week?\\" She used this experience to inspire herself for the role of Mimi. During this time at WCBS she worked nights at New York comedy clubs to improve her improvisational comedy skills. This led to a job teaching improv classes. Bill Sherwood, a director, attended. He later wrote a part for her in his 1986 film, Parting Glances. =Career= Armed with the success of Parting Glances, Kinney visited friends in Los Angeles, and decided to permanently move there to pursue a career in acting. In L.A., Kinney worked hard as a character actress, getting small roles in various TV series such as Seinfeld (Season 4, Episode 22, \\"The Handicap Spot),\\" Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (with Drew Carey, contemporaneous with The Drew Carey Shows second season), Grace Under Fire, Full House, Boy Meets World, The Larry Sanders Show, and My Name Is Earl. Her first memorable television role is generally considered her regular stint on Newhart as Miss Goddard, the town librarian (1989‚Äì1990). Kinney has avoided auditions for what she calls \\"the heavy-girl roles\\". Critics occasionally grumble that Mimi, her character on The Drew Carey Show, is a waddling fat joke, but her weight has never seemed to be the point of a fat joke. \\"One time I had to say to Drew, 'Aw, you're just fat,' as the ultimate put-down. I personally don't like it, but if fat jokes slip in because they're funny, I don't care.\\" She is, however, less comfortable about being typecast because of her weight. \\"Once in a while I would lose some weight, just by accident, and someone would say to me, 'You're going to diet yourself out of a career,'\\" she says. \\"And I tell them, 'I'm losing weight, not my talent.' Why is it the first thing [some people] look at is the shape? It points up to me the prejudice that still exists.\\" The Mimi Bobeck character was written only into the pilot of The Drew Carey Show. The character interviewed for a cosmetics job at Winfred-Louder and when not hired, because of her garish makeup, raised a big fuss and threatened to sue. Positive public reaction prompted the Mimi storyline to continue, as the store hired her as a secretary to prevent her from suing. The show aired from 1995 to 2004. Kinney has also appeared in the American version of Whose Line Is It Anyway?, again working with Drew Carey. In addition to her television roles, Kinney has appeared in several movies, including Arachnophobia, Stanley & Iris, Scrooged, Three Fugitives, Lenny the Wonder Dog, and This Boy's Life. In 2006 she visited Iraq with former co-star Drew Carey and his Improv All-Star Team, a series of USO performance for American troops; film of her appearance appears in the documentary Patriot Act: A Jeffrey Ross Home Movie. In 2008, Kinney became the co-creator and star of MrsP.com, an entertainment website for children. Kinney portrays Mrs. P, an eccentric redhead who loves books and reads classic children's stories from her magical library. After nearly two years in development, the site launched in beta on November 10, 2008. On March 24, 2009, Kinney appeared in character as Mimi in the beginning of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. A week later (April Fools' Day), Kinney reprised her role as Mimi during that day's The Price Is Right, hosted by Carey, appearing as a guest model. She repeated the role on April Fool's Day 2010, this time usurping the post of executive producer. She replaced the show's announcer with a man in a monkey suit along with using 4 male models. She guest starred on The Penguins of Madagascar as Rhonda the walrus, Marlene's disgusting roommate, in the 2009 episode \\"Roomies.\\" Rhonda made a second appearance in the episode \\"The Hoboken Surprise\\" in 2011. In March 2010, Kinney co-authored with Cindy Ratzlaff a book entitled Queen of Your Own Life: The Grown-up Woman's Guide to Claiming Happiness and Getting the Life You Deserve, published by Harlequin. Kinney also guest-starred on The Secret Life of the American Teenager. Beginning in March 2011, Kinney appeared in Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza. In September 2019, Kinney appeared on American Housewife. She played the lunch lady in the episode \\"Bigger Kids, Bigger Problems\\" and she reunites with former co-stars Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles and Diedrich Bader as part of ABC's Cast from the Past Week.

Hosni Mubarak, the former President of Egypt, won a fifth consecutive six-year term in office, with official results showing he won 88.6% of the vote. Mubarak's opponent, Ayman Nour, of the Tomorrow Party, is estimated to have received 7.3% of the vote and Numan Gumaa received 2.8%, however, Nour claimed that prior polling results showed over 30%. Criticism of the election process has centred on the process of selecting the eligible candidates, and on alleged election-law violations during voting. Mubarak was sworn in for his new term on September 27. Candidates The election was the first-ever multi-party election in the history of Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian rule. Ten parties were set to take part; the leading candidates were: *Hosni Mubarak of the National Democratic Party *Numan Gumaa of the New Wafd Party *Ayman Nour of the Tomorrow Party Also contending were: *Osama Shaltut of the Solidarity Party *Ibrahim Turk of the Democratic Union Party *Ahmad al-Sabahi of the Umma Party *Rifaat al-Agrudi of the National Conciliation Party *Fawzi Ghaza of the Egypt 2000 Party *Mamduh Qinawi of the Constitutional Party *Wahid al-Uqsuri of the Egyptian Arab Socialist Party (disqualified on September 3) Change from referendum on Mubarak's rule Until recently, Egyptians have only been able to approve or reject a candidate appointed by parliament, which is dominated by Hosni Mubarak's NDP. Mubarak had been re-elected four times during his 24-year rule by such a referendum. Mubarak won the 1999 referendum with almost 94% of the vote, though turnout was probably around 10%.Opposition claims massive fraud in Egypt electoral poll - Forbes.com A constitutional amendment approved in a referendum in May 2005 opened the way for multi- candidate presidential elections. 2005 presidential election process Under Egyptian election law, all Egyptians over age eighteen are required to vote. However, out of a population of approximately 77,500,000 (the largest in the Arab world), only about 32 million voters were registered (approximately 40% of the total population). Under the election law, parties proposed candidates for the election, which were reviewed by the Presidential Election Commission. Of the 30 proposed candidates, only 10 were allowed to participate in the presidential election by the Presidential Election Commission. One prominent candidate not allowed to run was Talaat Sadat, the nephew of former President Anwar Sadat, who appealed his disqualification unsuccessfully. Egypt's largest Islamic group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was not permitted to field a candidate for the election because the organization is banned by the government, which prohibits political parties with a stated religious agenda. The Brotherhood did not back any of the other candidates, but they encouraged Egyptians to go to the polls and vote for anyone other than Mubarak. The election campaign kicked off on August 17, 2005 and lasted until September 4, 2005.BBC NEWS  Middle East  Egypt election campaigning begins While many believed Hosni Mubarak's re-election a foregone conclusion, he campaigned seriously, trying to win votes across Egypt. 9,865 polling places were open until 10:00 p.m. Wednesday, September 7, so that voters could cast their ballots. Full results were not expected until at least Thursday September 8. The election was overseen by Egyptian judges. No international monitors were allowed to oversee the election. According to a late August report by the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, media coverage was biased in favour of Hosni Mubarak. If no candidate had received 50% of the vote, the top two candidates would have contested a second election scheduled for September 17. Criticisms of the 2005 presidential election arrangements Some of the main legal opposition parties, including the leftist Tagammu Party and the Nasserist Party, boycotted the election, saying it was unlikely to be free or fair. Those opposing the election said the electoral reforms had not gone far enough because the election regulations severely restricted independent candidates and overwhelmingly favoured the NDP. Secondly, the Muslim Brotherhood, believed to be the most popular opposition group in Egypt, was excluded from running in the elections because Mubarak's government had made it officially illegal and barred from major political processes. Supporters of the Brotherhood and other opposition parties stated that this undermined the credibility of the election. In addition, there appeared to be official harassment of the leading opposition candidate Nour, who was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested on January 2005, on what many observers regarded as trumped-up charges. He was imprisoned for a short time that year before public and international outcry resulted in his release before trial. The New Wafd Party and the Tomorrow (Ghad) Party contested the election even though they had opposed the May 2005 constitutional referendum, and their respective candidates, Numan Gumaa and Ayman Nour, drew significant support‚ÄîNour won 12% and Gumaa won 5-7%. Results Media reports on September 8, based on anonymous statements from election commission officials, stated that preliminary results showed President Hosni Mubarak winning 78% - 80%Mubarak Wins Egypt Vote - CBS News of the vote and Ayman Nour winning 12%.This page is available to GlobePlus subscribers Gumaa was reported as receiving 5-7%.Panel Rejects Nour‚Äôs Charge of Vote Fraud Late reports from September 8 placed Mubarak's numbers at approximately 72%, based once again on anonymous sources. The official result, that Mubarak won the election with 88.6% of the vote, was announced on September 9, 2005. Detailed results, with results and voting breakdowns by province for 15 of the 26 provinces (not including the largest provinces), were published in Al-Ahram, a state newspaper. The same source states that Nour won 6.2% in the 15 provinces, 20% in the Nile delta province of Buheira, and 16% in Alexandria. =Nour demands rerun of election= Following widespread reports of election law violations, Nour immediately demanded a rerun of the election. However, the Presidential Election Commission rejected his request as baseless on September 8, 2005, a decision that cannot be appealed. Nour's campaign manager, Wael Nawara, noted the Nour camp's surprise that the Presidential Election Commission would reject Nour's claims \\"despite the coverage from the media and the repetitive nature of these complaints.\\" =International reactions= Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal stated that the elections show that Mubarak has democratic intentions and that elections can take place there without harming stability: \\"The poll that took place in Egypt refutes the case made by those who claim Egypt is unstable and question its march toward the future.\\" United States State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that the United States saw this election as a \\"historic departure\\" and the debate during the election process would \\"enrich the Egyptian political dialogue, certainly for years to come.\\" McCormack also stated that \\"the Egyptian security services showed discipline in ensuring safety and security\\" and praised the \\"relative calm\\" of Election Day. However, McCormack criticized the lack of international monitors and the late decision to allow monitors, as well as the lack of media access that prevented opposition candidates from getting their message out. As for election day itself, he stated that \\"there were reports of some irregularities at polling places in terms of campaign posters or t-shirts being seen at the actual polling place and a variety of other issues.\\" The United States expressed its hope that \\"the Egyptian Government and the Egyptian people can build upon this positive first step in holding this multi-candidate presidential election and build on the positive experiences, the positive actions in this election, as they look towards parliamentary elections in the fall time and look to addressing some of those issues that I mentioned that were less positive.\\" Election day events Though support for Mubarak is significant and he was expected to win by a wide margin, charges of widespread confusion, ballot stuffing, vote-buying, intimidation, and other forms of voter fraud marred the election on September 7, 2005. =Low turnout= The Mubarak government initially stated that turnout was high, though numbers varied. Surprisingly, on September 9, the government released results and turnout figures that were low and may have been accurate, as low in some places as 19%. On September 8, however, an election official and Mubarak's campaign both stated that it was around 30%.Controversy Swirls Over Egypt Vote Both on election day and afterwards, election monitoring groups stated that turnout was low, reportedly because ordinary Egyptians thought the outcome a foregone conclusion. On September 8, anonymous sources stated turnout in Alexandria, the second-largest city in Egypt, was 17%, and turnout in Isma√Ølia (a city of about 750,000) was about 24%, with Mubarak taking more than 80% of the vote. Wael Namara, a spokesman for Ayman Nour of the Tomorrow Party, estimated turnout to be between 10 and 15% in the countryside and from 3 to 5% in the cities.Breaking News, Business News, Financial and Investing News & More  Reuters.co.uk In previous elections, voter turnout has run at less than 10 percent. Voter turnout in the May 2005 referendum that allowed the presidential election was officially reported as 54%, but judges monitoring the elections said it was more like 3%. =Alleged irregularities= Allegations of election law violations surfaced during the voting. News media reported that Mubarak's National Democratic Party transported voters to the polls by bus,SignOnSanDiego.com > News > World - Egyptians vote in first contested presidential election and allegedly did not allow voters to mark their choices behind a curtain, an essential requirement of a secret ballot. Polling stations in Cairo were plastered with Mubarak posters and members of the NDP hovered over voters, taking ballots from voters and handing them to polling station officials.Activists defy protest ban as Egypt votes in 'false' election - Middle East, World - The Independent Ayman Nour of the Tomorrow Party, one of the most prominent opposition candidates, along with others, has accused the government of not using truly indelible ink on the hands of voters, allowing voters favoring Hosni Mubarak to remove stamps indicating they had voted and return to vote again. Indelible ink was used only in major boxes, while non-permanent ink was used in many other boxes. There were rumors of certain voters that had no ink at all which would make voter fraud even less difficult.Metro News Nour also alleged that there was widespread vote- buying, a charge supported by the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights, though not otherwise corroborated.Egytians vote for president - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights, while supporting Nour's claims, has stated that the irregularities were insufficient to require a rerun of the election. =Protests by Kefaya movement= On September 7, men in plainclothes broke up a Cairo protest by the Kefaya movement calling for Egyptians to boycott the elections, beating some of the protesters. Media sources state that as many as three thousand Kifaya protesters illegally marched on central Cairo, possibly the largest crowd ever drawn by that protest movement, while armed soldiers and police watched.Scotsman.com News =Election monitoring= At 10:00 a.m. on September 7, two hours after the start of the election, Egypt's Presidential Election Commission unexpectedly stated that it would allow civil society groups to monitor the election. However, in many cases they were not allowed into polling places and were beaten and interrogated, especially in Southern Egypt. These citizen monitors were in addition to the Egyptian judges who have been allowed to independently monitor the elections.http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/12577556.htm =More protests= A larger protest of around 10,000 people was organized by Kifaya on September 10, 2005, to contest the election results and the mass rigging activities and cheating that occurred on the election day. It was reported by independent observers, reporters and candidate representatives that the NDP (Mubarak's Party) used government resources to change the election results. In some cases, citizens were beaten or forced to vote for Mubarak. In other cases, the boxes were already filled with marked ballots. However, the most explicit action that provoked the protest was allowing pro-Mubarak voters only to vote without being previously registered in the voter lists, giving Mubarak between 20 and 30 extra illegal points in the results.Bot generated title -->  See also  * 2012 Egyptian presidential election References External links *BBC: Guide to Egypt's election *BBC: Egypt votes in landmark election *Washington Post: Mubarak Wins Egypt's First Open Vote *IFEX: Election coverage favours Mubarak Category:2005 elections in Africa Presidential election 2005 ","title":"2005 Egyptian presidential election"},{"id":"2191010","text":"Access Communications was a major Canadian cable television provider, particularly in parts of Nova Scotia, until its acquisition by Shaw Communications in 1999.

Headquartered in Regina, the co-operative provides internet, cable television, telephone and security services to residential and business customers. Its primary competitor is Saskatchewan's government-owned SaskTel. History Access Communications was established in 1974 as the Regina Cablevision Co-operative. After a prolonged legal and constitutional dispute between the federal and the provincial governments, which had differing visions of how cable television should be delivered in the province, the co-operative was granted a Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licence for broadcast in 1976 and began providing cable television services as Cable Regina on February 14, 1978. More than 24,000 households in Regina signed up for cable services in its first years of operations. After nearly two decades focusing solely on cable television and local broadcasting, the co-operative launched dial-up internet service in September 1995 and cable modem broadband service followed in 1997. Cable Regina diversified and extended its reach into other areas of the province in the 1990s through the acquisition of other cable television providers in Regina Beach, White City, Weyburn, Estevan and Yorkton. On April 17, 2000, the co-operative's name changed to Access Communications. In the early 2000s, Access Communications merged with the Battlefords Community Cablevision. Primary line telephone services were launched in 2007. Looking to further expand its presence in smaller communities, Access Communications purchased Persona's cable operations in Saskatchewan from Halifax-based Eastlink in 2009, becoming the largest cable television provider in the province. In 2015, Access Communications acquired Askivision and Saskatoon- based Little Loon Wireless; the purchase of the latter allowed the co- operative to deliver fixed-wireless broadband high-speed internet to rural areas in Saskatchewan. Services Access Communications offers cable modem and fixed-wireless broadband internet, cable television (digital and analog), telephone, home security and home automation. =Internet= Access Communications uses a hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) network infrastructure to deliver its internet services. In March 2019, it announced that it is one of the internet service providers participating in the federal government's Connecting Families Program. =Cable television= Access Communications distributes standard definition and high-definition cable television programming, including digital cable. It offers digital video recorders such as TiVo, video-on-demand services and has implemented switched digital video (SDV) technology in many markets. =Telephone= Access Communications' digital phone service was launched in February 2007 and utilizes IP technology instead of a traditional landline. Such a system operates on an ATA (Analog Telephony Adapter) device with a built-in cable modem. The modem communicates over cable lines to a private IP network. In this sense, it can be considered VoIP, in that it is voice delivered over an IP network. However, because it travels over dedicated lines, it is still designed to be usable in a power outage scenario. =Home security= The co-operative offers home security and home automation services. In 2016, an Alarm.com-based home automation monitored service was introduced. Subscribers can secure and monitor their property through web-based and mobile applications, as well as through Apple, Amazon and Google devices. =Access7= Access Communications broadcasts the Access7 community channel in 100 communities and airs a variety of locally produced shows and events, including shows highlighting multicultural, Indigenous and LGBTQ2S+ perspectives in Saskatchewan. Its sports coverage includes broadcasts of the Regina Pats and other Western Hockey League games. Its first agreement with the Western Hockey League was signed in 1993. Structure Access Communications operates as a not-for-profit co-operative and its brand focuses on its community-based ownership, reinvesting its revenues on service improvements, as well as promoting and supporting local events and community organizations. It has a charity, the Access Communications Children's Fund, as well as a scholarship program. In 2019, the co-operative supported close to 2,000 community groups and was recognized as one of Canada's Best Diversity Employers, one of Saskatchewan Top 100 Companies and was named a Caring Company by Imagine Canada in 2017.

It is approximately halfway between the major Australian cities of Sydney and Brisbane. It is the seat of Bellingen Shire and has a mixture of valley, plateau and coastal environments. Etymology The township lies on the Bellinger River. In 1841, Government surveyor Clement Hodgkinson visited the area. When naming newly discovered places, he preferred to use existing native place names rather than foreign ones, so he used the Gumbaynggir name for river, \\"Billingen\\" as the name of the area. The name has also been reported as meaning \\"clean water\\", \\"winding river\\", \\"quoll\\" and \\"cheeky fellow\\". Originally, Bellingen was pronounced \\"Billingen\\", where the \\"ng\\" was pronounced as in \\"sing\\". When it came time to write the word, the Aboriginal voice and the European ear combined to give a spelling of \\"Billingen\\", \\"Billengen\\", \\"Bellengen\\" or \\"Bellingen\\". European usage has altered the original pronunciation to the current \\"Bellin-jen\\". To further confuse the issue, a draughtsman who was compiling the Colony map from original documents misread Hodgkinson's final handwritten \\"n\\" as an \\"r\\"; meaning that the Bellingen River officially became the \\"Bellinger\\", while the town retained the correct name of \\"Bellingen\\". History The Bellinger Valley including Bellingen was first settled by Kooris ‚Äì the Gumbaynggir people ‚Äì long before European settlement. The first European into the Bellinger Valley was the stockman William Myles who arrived in 1840 looking for new valleys north of Kempsey and the Macleay River. The following year Myles, accompanied by Surveyor Clement Hodgkinson explored the valley and by 1842 there were cedar cutters at the mouth of the Bellinger River and sheep grazing in the valley. In July 1843 the first cargo of red cedar from the Bellinger valley was transported to Sydney. So determined were the local Aborigines to keep the cedar cutters and explorers off their land that they regularly attacked the cedar cutters camps and when Hodgkinson returned to the valley he was accompanied by members of the Yarrahappinni group who he hoped would explain his 'innocent' intentions to the locals. In 1845 it was estimated that there were 300 Aborigines living in the Bellinger Valley. The growth of cedar cutting throughout the 1840s was dramatic with 20 pit sawers operating along the river by 1843 and, by 1849, the first timber vessel, the 'Minerva', being built by a shipwright named William Darbyshire. The cedar was hauled down to the river by teams of bullocks or horses. So rich was the area in cedar that it was estimated that over 2 million feet of cedar were being extracted each year. In 1864 a site was set apart and reserved for the village of Bellingen. The town allotments were surveyed in 1869 and were sold by public auction at West Kempsey Court House on Sep 14 1870, the deeds in every case describing the land as in the village of Bellingen. In the 1890s, Bellingen was selected as the government centre of the valley, due to its location at the tidal limit of the Bellinger River and the availability of fresh water. A period of rapid growth ensued. By the early 1900s, red cedar supplies were virtually depleted, except for those that survived in the inaccessible upper reaches of the Bellinger Valley. The cleared areas were turned into prime farming land and the valley became a dairying centre. The indigenous population had been decimated by disease and inability to move across the land to locate traditional food supplies, and many were killed in their bid to drive away the cedar getters and new settlers from traditional Gumbaynggir land. 'Black Jimmy' is reported to be the last full-blood member of the Bellinger Gumbaynggir People. Black Jimmy died in 1922 and is buried in Bellingen Cemetery. The Gumbaynggir People still live in the area of Bellingen. The dairy industry crashed in the 1960s with the rise of the European Common Market, when export prices fell (with Britain no longer relying on Australian dairy products) and the margarine industry finally overcame laws restricting its production levels. Dairy farming still continues to a lesser extent. Rainforest logging ceased altogether in 1975. Sclerophyll forest logging is still carried out, but to a much lesser extent than in the past. In 1950, Bellingen came to national fame with the birth of the Sara Quads (Sara family quadruplets). From the 1970s until the present, alternative life-stylers purchased land in the area and built owner-built homes. Numerous intentional communities were established, many of which are still in existence. The rural lifestyle of Bellingen and surrounds has consequently diverged and is now a mix of traditional and non-traditional farming. Many of today's residents, such as artists, craftspeople, writers, musicians and horticulturalists, have established home-based activities.  Heritage listings  Bellingen has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 69-75 Hyde Street: Hammond and Wheatley Commercial Emporium Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,074 people in Bellingen. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.0% of the population. * 78.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.2%. * 89.8% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 46.9%, Catholic 13.1% and Anglican 12.5%. Climate Owing to high rainfall and its proximity to the valleys of the Bellinger and Kalang rivers, Bellingen is known for its frequent flooding. Tallowood Point near Bellingen often has the State's highest annual rainfall. the Bellingens Lavender Bridge also gets flooded often Culture Bellingen was one of the filming locations for the 2003 comedy film Danny Deckchair, written and directed by Jeff Balsmeyer. Bellingen was also the notional setting of the book Oscar and Lucinda written by Booker Prize winning author Peter Carey. The film version of the novel Eucalyptus was scheduled to be filmed in Bellingen as well before it fell through. Bellingen has a strong affinity with the arts and is home to numerous festivals: historically the popular Global Carnival (often known simply as \\" The Global\\"), the Bellingen Jazz and Blues Festival, and the current Camp Creative, the Bellingen Music Festival (classical music), Bello Winter Music Festival and the Bellingen Readers and Writers Festival, held for the first time in 2011. The first and original festival, an annual event, was the Azalea Festival, which included a procession of floats, the local brass band and pipeband, and various community organisations marching down Hyde Street to the cheers and applause of the spectators. Bellingen also hosts the twice yearly Plant Fairs as a fundraiser for the Bellingen Environment Centre. These fairs attract thousands of visitors to the town and the 70+ stall-holders provide information and sell bushland-friendly Australian native, food-bearing and landscape plants and heirloom seeds, garden equipment, furniture and supplies to provide local food, and habitat for native birds and animals. Tourism has been encouraged in recent years by the cafe, market, festival and motorcycling culture. More recently, there has been an annual meet for Harley Davidson enthusiasts riding from Queensland and regional NSW. This annual meet has been organised by a local motorcycling enthusiast which sees riders converging at the Diggers Tavern for accommodation and then riding the scenic roads in the region.

It was commanded by Paul Hausser during the Third Battle of Kharkov and the Battle of Kursk in 1943 and by Wilhelm Bittrich on the Western Front in 1944. World War II =1942-1943= The II SS Panzer Corps was formed from SS Division Leibstandarte, SS Division Das Reich and SS Division Totenkopf in July 1942 as the SS Panzer Corps. In August, it was sent to northern France before taking part in the Case Anton, the occupation of Vichy France in November, during which it captured Toulon. In early February 1943, the corps, under the command of SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Paul Hausser, was attached to Army Group South in Ukraine and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov. The corps was renamed II SS Panzer Corps in June 1943, after the I SS Panzer Corps was created during that same month. In July 1943, the corps took part in the failed Operation Citadel, spearheading 4th Panzer Army's attack in the southern sector. The corps' three SS divisions were involved in the Battle of Prokhorovka at the edge of the German penetration into the salient. After the operation was canceled in light of its failure, the corps was ordered to the Italian front in August. Only one division, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ended up being transferred, along with the corps personnel. The remaining combat divisions remained on the Eastern Front to deal with the developing threats from the Soviet Belgorod- Khar'kov Offensive Operation. Leibstandarte took part in operations to disarm Italian troops. Between 20 September and 20 of November 1943 the corps conducted operations against Yugoslav Partisans in order to establish a connection with Army Group F in the Balkans and to secure communications east and northwards from Trieste and Rijeka. In these operations, according to the Corps Headquarters' Medical Department, the corps suffered total losses of 936 men.NAW, T354, roll 606, frames 321-410 According to Croat authors, in the first phase against partisans on Istrian peninsula (Unternehmen Istrien), some 2000 partisans and 2000 civilians were killed by German forces, and additional 1200 were arrested, with some 400 transported to concentration camps.Istrapedia (Croat.)

Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 228., was sent from France to the Eastern Front, where it played the main role in de-blockading the encircled 1st Panzer Army in the Kamenets-Podolsky Pocket, also known as Hube Pocket. It was the first major transfer of forces from France to the East since the creation of the F√ºhrer Directive 51, which no longer allowed any transfers from the West to the East. After rescuing the better part of the 1st Panzer Army, the corps then participated in the attempt to de-blockade the trapped German garrison of the 4th Panzer Army in the town of Tarnopol, which was declared to be fortress (Festung) by the Germans. However, the Red Army had prepared defenses there and the relief operation ultimately failed. After this, the corps was moved into the reserve of the newly created Army Group North Ukraine. In mid-June 1944, the corps was ordered west to take part in the Battle of Normandy, arriving to the invasion front in late June 1944.Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 235. The corps was involved in heavy fighting against the British 21st Army Group in the Battle of Caen. During this period, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Wilhelm Bittrich was placed in command of the corps. In August 1944, the corps participated in the battles in and around the Falaise Pocket. The corps then retreated across France. On 17 September 1944, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden, an airborne offensive aimed at capturing the Rhine bridge at Arnhem. The corps was involved in fighting against the British 1st Airborne Division in the Battle of Arnhem and also against the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and British XXX Corps in Nijmegen. In preparation for the Ardennes Offensive, the corps was placed in reserve of 6th SS Panzer Army and committed on 21 December 1944 near St. Vith. After the northern assault stalled, the corps was transferred south to take part in the attack on Bastogne. The corps' divisions suffered heavy losses in the battles against the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. After the operation's failure, the corps returned to the defensive, seeing action against American forces in the Eifel region. In February 1945, the corps was ordered to Hungary to take part in an offensive to recapture Budapest and the Hungarian oilfields. The corps took part in Operation Spring Awakening, launched near Lake Balaton on 6 March 1945. After the failure of the offensive, the corps retreated, alongside the I SS and IV SS Panzer Corps, towards Vienna. After the Soviet forces captured the city, individual units attempted to break out to the west. The elements of the corps surrendered to the U.S. Army on 8 May 1945.

In this comedy, a 12th-century knight and his squire travel in time to the end of the 20th century and find themselves adrift in modern society. Les Visiteurs was the highest-grossing film in France in 1993 and remains the fifth highest grossing French film ever. The publicity for the film used the tagline Ils ne sont pas n√©s d'hier (\\"They weren't born yesterday\\"). Reno and Clavier reprised their roles in a sequel in 1998, the American remake Just Visiting in 2001 and a second sequel in 2016. The castle of Ermenonville, in Oise d√©partement, served as decoration for the castle of Montmirail in the current time and the Cit√© de Carcassonne for medieval period.  Plot  In the year 1123, Godefroy Amaury de Malf√™te, Count of Apremont and Papincourt, saves the life of his beloved sovereign, King Louis VI \\"Le Gros\\" (\\"The Fat\\") from the sword of a \\"horribilis\\" Englishman. For this action of bravery, the King makes him Count of Montmirail and promises him the woman he loves, the beautiful Fr√©n√©gonde de Pouille. On his way to the castle to marry Fr√©n√©gonde, Godefroy takes a witch prisoner, and she drugs his drinking flask. Hallucinating, he believes the Duke of Pouille, father of his future wife, is a ferocious bear, and kills him with a crossbow bolt. During the Duke's funeral, Fr√©n√©gonde refuses to marry Godefroy because of the tragedy; meanwhile, Godefroy's servant, the disreputable Jacquouille la Fripouille, steals the Duke's jewels at end of the funeral. In an attempt to repair his mistake, Godefroy asks the wizard Eusebius to send him back in time to a moment before he shot the Duke. The old wizard muddles his magical spell, accidentally sending Godefroy and Jacquouille to the year 1992. There, they immediately run into trouble. Godefroy attacks a postman driving his car, mistaking him for a Moor in a devil's chariot; when he meets his descendant, B√©atrice de Montmirail, an aristocrat who looks exactly like Fr√©n√©gonde, she calls the Gendarmerie, who first imprison him, then as B√©atrice thinks Godefroy is her distant cousin suffering from amnesia, take him to a mental hospital. Jacquouille, meanwhile, is befriended by Ginette la Clocharde (\\"Ginette the Tramp\\" in French), an attractive vagrant they meet early in their adventure. B√©atrice, thinking Godefroy to be her long-lost stuntman cousin Hubert, gets Godefroy out of the mental hospital and takes them back to her home, much to her husband (who greatly dislikes the fact of the two being in their home) Jean-Pierre's dismay. There, various culture- shock comedy ensues as Godefroy and Jacquouille attempt to fathom modern household appliances, such as flooding the bathroom by leaving the tap open, using an umbrella as a pike to roast a leg of lamb and setting it on fire, washing their hands in the toilet, trashing the bathroom during their baths and wasting all of the family's 6,000 FF Chanel No. 5, greatly angering Jean- Pierre. Seeing the family seal on Godefroy's hand, Beatrice assumes he stole the jewel from the castle de Montmirail, now renovated into an expensive hotel. They go there and meet the owner of the castle, the effete Jacques- Henri Jacquard, the unwitting descendant and close likeness of Jacquouille (they react to each other with mutual disgust). The jewel on Godefroy's hand starts to burn as they get closer to the castle, where the present-day version of the seal is. The two seals explode and destroy Jacquard's brand new Range Rover. Godefroy books a room for the night and reopens a secret passage known only to him. There he finds a letter telling him to go to a certain address, where an aged Monsieur Ferdinand, the last descendant of the wizard Eusebius, gives him the potion that will return him to the year 1123. Jacquouille, however, wants to stay, enjoying Ginette's company and having proved more adaptable than Godefroy in discovering toothpaste, modern clothing and other amenities of the future. Furious at his behavior, Godefroy finally brings him to the hotel room by force. While Godefroy is talking with B√©atrice, Jacquouille swaps jackets with his descendant, closes the curtains, dims the lights, drugs Jacquard and puts him on the bed in his place. In the dark, Godefroy gives Jacquard (thinking it is Jacquouille) the potion which then sends him back to the year 1123. Godefroy equally comes back just in time to stop himself from shooting Fr√©n√©gonde's father, and the deflected crossbow bolt kills the witch who caused the whole misadventure by drugging Godefroy's flask. The bewildered Jacquard finds himself stranded in the past in the role of Godefroy's servant as Godefroy leaves on horseback with Fr√©n√©gonde.

The Stephens Media Group station broadcasts at 103.9 MHz with an effective radiated power of 39,000 watts. History \\"BOB-FM\\" was originally signed on the air in 2004 by Citadel with high acceptance by the Spokane market. It quickly became a low rated station until Mapleton bought it in 2007. In the Summer 2011 Arbitron ratings survey, BOB-FM rated #1 12+. KBBD was previously known as KYWL (\\"Wild 103.9\\"), which played hip hop and R&B; and called itself \\"Spokane's party station\\". Before Wild started in 2001, ‚Äú103.9 The Hawk‚Äù KWHK played classic rock, and before that, active rock (when the station was known as \\"Z-Rock\\"). In the late 90s, KNJY ‚ÄúZ-Rock‚Äù was up against stiff competition with Rock 94 1/2. 103.9 started out in the 80s playing an adult contemporary leaning pop format as KVXO. During the period from approximately 1985‚Äì1988, KVXO was known as \\"Power 104\\", a Mainstream CHR of the same ilk as \\"Zoo FM\\", KZZU, its main format competitor. Notable personalities on \\"Power 104\\" included Lee St. Michaels and Rob Fisher (Leroy & the Pepper); Tracie Lee; Jeff Melton; Jim \\"The Bod\\" Larsin; Greg \\"The Blade\\" Young; and TJ Colllins. In 1986, Collins began a show called \\"The Power Switch\\" where he \\"switched\\" the format and played hip hop and R&B; not played on other radio stations in Spokane at the time; thus, becoming the first DJ to play hip-hop on commercial radio in Spokane. Collins also featured local and regional unsigned rap artists and began airing mixes by local DJ, GrandMixer GMS. The Power Switch was a very popular show that originally aired for two hours every Sunday night. Conflict over the show developed due to the dislike of rap music by another employee so in the fall of 1987, the show was moved to 11:30 p.m. to midnight, Monday through Friday. Given the demographic of the majority of The Power Switch listeners, who were mostly high school and college students, the popularity declined and the show was cancelled in early 1988. Success in the ratings does not always equal revenue success, so \\"Power 104\\" went dark on December 24, 1988, as then Program Director Ed Donohue pulled the plug on the transmitter.

He is remembered today for his taxonomic work on the fauna of Siberia and for his attempts to establish relations between Imperial Russia and Tokugawa Japan. In 1757, Laxmann started his studies at the Academy of √Öbo and was subsequently ordained a Lutheran priest in St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia. In 1764, he was appointed as a preacher in a small parish in Barnaul in central Siberia, whence he undertook a number of exploratory journeys, reaching Irkutsk, Baikal, Kiakhta and the border to China. His collection of material on the fauna of Siberia made him famous in scientific circles and in 1770, he was appointed professor of chemistry and economy at the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1769, Laxmann was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  Irkutsk  In 1780, Laxmann settled in Irkutsk, where he would spend much of the rest of his life.Biographical entry in Nordisk familjebok (in Swedish) In 1782, Laxmann founded a museum in Irkutsk, which is the oldest in Siberia.The irkutsk's museum of regional studies Laxmann also ran a glass factory in a suburb of Irkutsk, around 6 versts (~6 kilometers) away from the center of the city with a famous merchant Alexander Andreyevich Baranov as a business partner;Openair Museum of Taltsy viewed 2009-05-13 the factory was roughly 36 metres (20 ken) square. Products were not only sold domestically, but also to northeastern China. Although he had many connections to local people of importance, Laxmann developed an antagonistic relationship with Grigory Shelikhov, a seafarer and merchant. Laxmann noticed that Shelikhov, along with the Irkutsk Governor-General's Office had tried to pressure Daikokuya K≈çday≈´, a Japanese castaway, into staying in Russia and serving as a translator for the merchant. The fact that Shelikhov also had strong connections with some Russian bureaucrats made the situation more complex. After Laxmann went to St.Petersburg on Kodayu's behalf, he began to send letters directly to Grand Chancellor Alexander Bezborodko (due to the Chancellor's high position, the use of intermediaries was normally required).  Japan  =Carl Peter Thunberg= Laxmann already had some knowledge about Japan before he met Japanese castaways, reading books written by Carl Peter Thunberg, with whom Laxmann had some communication. =Daikokuya Kodayu= In 1789, while doing research in Irkutsk, Laxmann came across six Japanese who had been found in Amchitka, one of the Aleutian Islands, by Russian furriers whose leader was a person called Nivizimov. Laxmann escorted the castaways to St. Petersburg, where Daikokuya K≈çday≈´, their nominal leader, pleaded with Empress Catherine the Great to be allowed to return to Japan. During this stay in the capital, Laxmann began discussions on various matters with Alexander Bezborodko, but succumbed to a bout of typhoid fever which left him incapacitated for three months. Laxmann recovered consciousness in early May when Catherine had just moved to Tsarskoye Selo for the summer. Laxmann sent Kodayu to Tsarskoye Selo ahead of him, and Kodayu was able to meet with the Empress several times over six months, as a result of Laxman's dedicated efforts among the Russian bureaucracy, especially with Alexander Bezborodko and chancellor Alexander Vorontsov. At each presentation at Tsarskoye Selo, Laxmann walked along with Kodayu in order to assist him in the proper etiquette required in the Empress' presence. In 1791, Catherine agreed to a plan conceived by Laxman, under which Laxman's son, Lt. Adam Laxman would command a voyage to Japan, where he would exchange the castaways for economic agreements and concessions. Grigory Shelikhov had proposed another plan that would make the Japanese castaways Russian citizens so that they would be Japanese teachers and translators, but Catherine chose Laxmann and Bezborodko's plan. The elder Laxmann remained in Russia while his son traveled with the castaways. =Letters to Japanese scholars= Laxmann wrote letters to two Japanese scholars, Nakagawa Junan and Katsuragawa Hosh≈´, at the recommendation of Carl Peter Thunberg, their teacher. There is no record that the letters ever reached the scholars, even though Adam Laxmann handed the letters to Ishikawa Tadafusa, a staff member of Tokugawa Shogunate, in Matsumae, Hokkaid≈ç. Erik Laxmann had showed Kodayu the letters before Kodayu left Okhotsk. Katsuragawa Hoshu had lots of communication with Kodayu after Kodayu lived in Yedo so Hoshu edited some books on Russia and Kodayu's experience. It would be possible to think that Hoshu may have known that Laxmann had sent him a letter.  His family  Laxmann had a wife, Yekaterina Ivanovna, five sons, Gustav, Adam, one who died young, Afernaci and Martin and a daughter Mariya. He also lived with his younger brother, his wife and their two daughters, Anna and Elizabeta. Laxmann also had another younger brother, who lived in St. Petersburg.

It is composed of the prime oxide constituents of the Earth's rocky mantle (MgO and SiO2), and its pressure and temperature for stability imply that it is likely to occur in portions of the lowermost few hundred km of Earth's mantle. The post-perovskite phase has implications for the D‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ layer, which influences the convective mixing in the mantle responsible for plate tectonics. Post-perovskite has the same crystal structure as the synthetic solid compound CaIrO3, and is often referred to as the \\"CaIrO3-type phase of MgSiO3\\" in the literature. The crystal system of post-perovskite is orthorhombic, its space group is Cmcm, and its structure is a stacked SiO6-octahedral sheet along the b axis. The name \\"post-perovskite\\" derives from silicate perovskite, the stable phase of MgSiO3 throughout most of Earth's mantle, which has the perovskite structure. The prefix \\"post-\\" refers to the fact that it occurs after perovskite structured MgSiO3 as pressure increases (and historically, the progression of high pressure mineral physics). At upper mantle pressures, nearest Earth's surface, MgSiO3 persists as the silicate mineral enstatite, a pyroxene rock forming mineral found in igneous and metamorphic rocks of the crust. History The CaIrO3-type phase of MgSiO3 phase was discovered in 2004 using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC) technique by a group at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and, independently, by researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology who used a combination of quantum-mechanical simulations and LHDAC experiments. The TIT group's paper appeared in the journal Science. The ETH/JAM-EST collaborative paper and TIT group's second paper appeared two months later in the journal Nature. This simultaneous discovery was preceded by S. Ono's experimental discovery of a similar phase, possessing exactly the same structure, in Fe2O3. Importance in Earth's mantle Post-perovskite phase is stable above 120 GPa at 2500 K, and exhibits a positive Clapeyron slope such that the transformation pressure increases with temperature. Because these conditions correspond to a depth of about 2600 km and the D\\" seismic discontinuity occurs at similar depths, the perovskite to post-perovskite phase change is considered to be the origin of such seismic discontinuities in this region. Post-perovskite also holds great promise for mapping experimentally determined information regarding the temperatures and pressures of its transformation into direct information regarding temperature variations in the D\\" layer once the seismic discontinuities attributed to this transformation have been sufficiently mapped out. Such information can be used, for example, to: :1) better constrain the amount of heat leaving Earth's core :2) determine whether or not subducted slabs of oceanic lithosphere reach the base of the mantle :3) help delineate the degree of chemical heterogeneity in the lower mantle :4) find out whether or not the lowermost mantle is unstable to convective instabilities that result in upwelling hot thermal plumes of rock which rise up and possibly trace out volcanic hot spot tracks at Earth's surface. For these reasons the finding of the MgSiO3-post-perovskite phase transition is considered by many geophysicists to be the most important discovery in deep Earth science in several decades, and was only made possible by the concerted efforts of mineral physics scientists around the world as they sought to increase the range and quality of LHDAC experiments and as ab initio calculations attained predictive power. Physical properties The sheet structure of post-perovskite makes the compressibility of the b axis higher than that of the a or c axis. This anisotropy may yield the morphology of a platy crystal habit parallel to the (010) plane; the seismic anisotropy observed in the D\\" region might qualitatively (but not quantitatively) be explained by this characteristic. Theory predicted the (110) slip associated with particularly favorable stacking faults and confirmed by later experiments. Some theorists predicted other slip systems, which await experimental confirmation. In 2005 and 2006 Ono and Oganov published two papers predicting that post-perovskite should have high electrical conductivity, perhaps two orders of magnitude higher than perovskite's conductivity. In 2008 Hirose's group published an experimental report confirming this prediction. A highly conductive post-perovskite layer provides an explanation for the observed decadal variations of the length of day. Chemical properties Another potentially important effect that needs to be better characterized for the post-perovskite phase transition is the influence of other chemical components that are known to be present to some degree in Earth's lowermost mantle. The phase transition pressure (characterized by a two-phase loop in this system), was initially thought to decrease as the FeO content increases, but some recent experiments suggest the opposite. However, it is possible that the effect of Fe2O3 is more relevant as most of iron in post-perovskite is likely to be trivalent (ferric). Such components as Al2O3 or the more oxidized Fe2O3 also affect the phase transition pressure, and might have strong mutual interactions with one another. The influence of variable chemistry present in the Earth's lowermost mantle upon the post- perovskite phase transition raises the issue of both thermal and chemical modulation of its possible appearance (along with any associated discontinuities) in the D\\" layer. Summary Experimental and theoretical work on the perovskite/post-perovskite phase transition continues, while many important features of this phase transition remain ill-constrained. For example, the Clapeyron slope (characterized by the Clausius‚ÄìClapeyron relation) describing the increase in the pressure of the phase transition with increasing temperature is known to be relatively high in comparison to other solid-solid phase transitions in the Earth's mantle, however, the experimentally determined value varies from about 5 MPa/K to as high as 13 MPa/K. Ab initio calculations give a tighter range, between 7.5 MPa/K and 9.6 MPa/K, and are probably the most reliable estimates available today. The difference between experimental estimates arises primarily because different materials were used as pressure standards in Diamond Anvil Cell experiments. A well-characterized equation of state for the pressure standard, when combined with high energy synchrotron generated X-ray diffraction patterns of the pressure standard (which is mixed in with the experimental sample material), yields information on the pressure-temperature conditions of the experiment. However, as these extreme pressures and temperatures have not been sufficiently explored in experiments, the equations of state for many popular pressure standards are not yet well characterized and often yield different results. Another source of uncertainty in LHDAC experiments is the measurement of temperature from a sample's thermal radiation, which is required to obtain the pressure from the equation of state of the pressure standard. In laser- heated experiments at such high pressures (over 1 million atmospheres), the samples are necessarily small and numerous approximations (e.g., gray body) are required to obtain estimates of the temperature.

Since the decision to enter the dauer stage is dependent on environmental cues, it represents a classic and well studied example of polyphenism. The dauer state is given other names in the various types of nematodes such as ‚Äòdiapause‚Äô or ‚Äòhypobiosis‚Äô, but since the C. elegans nematode has become the most studied nematode, the term ‚Äòdauer stage‚Äô or 'dauer larvae' is becoming universally recognised when referring to this state in other free-living nematodes. The dauer stage is also considered to be equivalent to the infective stage of parasitic nematode larvae. As E. Maupas first proposed in 1899-1900, all nematodes have five stages separated by four moults. Under environmental conditions that are favorable for reproduction, C. elegans larvae develop through four stages or moults which are designated as L1, L2, L3 and L4. After L4, animals moult to the reproductive adult stage. However, when the environment is unfavorable, L1 and L2 animals have the option to divert their development from reproduction to dauer formation. Signals such as temperature, food supply, and levels of a dauer-inducing pheromone, a population density cue, influence this dauer decision. Dauer larvae are thus considered an alternative L3 stage larva, and this stage is sometimes preceded by L2d. L2d animals are considered pre-dauer and are characterised by delayed development and dark intestines produced by storage of fat. L2d larvae can either continue normal development or enter dauer stage depending on whether the conditions that triggered their formation persist. Dauer is not, however, a permanent condition. In fact, if the food supply and the population density become optimal for growth the dauer larvae can exit this stage and become L4s and then adults.RIDDLE, D.. 12 The Dauer Larva. Cold Spring Harbor Monograph Archive, North America, 17 January 1988. Available at: https://cshmonographs.org/index.php/monographs/article/view/5027/4126. Date accessed: 14 July 2016. Dauer larvae are extensively studied by biologists because of their ability to survive harsh environments and live for extended periods of time. For example, C. elegans dauer larvae can survive up to four months, much longer than their average lifespan of about three weeks during normal reproductive development. Two genes that are essential for dauer formation are daf-2 and daf-23. Dauer formation in C. elegans requires a nuclear receptor DAF-12 and a forkhead transcription factor DAF-16. In favorable environments, DAF-12 is activated by a steroid hormone, called dafachronic acid, produced by the cytochrome p450, DAF-9. DAF-9 and DAF-12 have been implicated by Cynthia Kenyon and colleagues as being required for extended longevity seen in animals that lack germlines. Kenyon showed that, although the daf-16 gene is required for life extension in C. elegans, the life extension effect can be uncoupled from dauer growth arrest. The lifespan increase was shown to be associated with an increase in stress resistance. A characteristic of the dauer stage is the pronounced alae which may be implicated in the entering (L1) and exiting (pre adult or L4 in C. elegans) of the dauer stage. Dauer larvae generally remain motionless, but can react to touch or vibrations. They can stand on their tails, waving their bodies in the air, and attach themselves to any passing animals, particularly insects, enabling them to travel to new food sources. For example, dauer larvae of rhabditids are often found in parallel rows under the elytra of dung beetles, which transport them to fresh supplies of dung. C. elegans strains lacking polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) undergo increased dauer arrest when grown without cholesterol. A study found endocannabinoids inhibit the dauer formation caused by PUFA deficiency or impaired cholesterol trafficking.

Early career =High school and college= Street attended Westlake High School in Austin, Texas, from 1997 to 2001, where he lettered in both football and baseball, winning all-state and all-district honors in both sports. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin from 2001‚Äì2004, where he pitched for the school's baseball team. Statistically one of the best collegiate closers of all time, Street is in the top 20 for career saves (41) and fewest hits allowed per nine innings (5.46).2018 NCAA Baseball Records Books; Division I Records http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/baseball_RB/2018/D1.pdf Street received All- American honors at Texas every season he was there, and helped his team win the College World Series of collegiate baseball in 2002. In that season, he set a CWS record for the most saves and was named Most Outstanding Player. He won the USA Baseball Richard W. \\"Dick\\" Case Award in 2003. A year later, Street led the Longhorns to the Series semifinals, and in 2004, he helped his team to the finals, only to lose in two games to Cal State Fullerton. In 2010, Street was named to the NCAA College World Series Legends Team.Landon Powell named to NCAA College World Series Legends Team  oaklandathletics.com: Official Info. Oakland.athletics.mlb.com. Retrieved on May 8, 2011. Professional career =Oakland Athletics= Drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the first round, 40th overall, of the 2004 MLB draft, Street spent a few months in the minor leagues, spending no more than a month at each level. He then was invited to the Arizona Fall League where his team took the championship. Street during his tenure with the Oakland Athletics Street was called up to the MLB at the start of the 2005 season. He became Oakland's closer when incumbent Octavio Dotel went down in May with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. Street saved 23 games in 27 chances to go along with a 5‚Äì1 record, 72 strikeouts, and a 1.72 ERA. Only Mariano Rivera's 1.38 ERA for the Yankees was better among American League relievers. Street had 72 strikeouts in 78 innings pitched, and opposing hitters batted only .194 against him. He was rewarded for his effort by being named Rookie of the Year, as the third player in a row who had spent some time in the Athletics organization (after √Ångel Berroa in 2003, and Bobby Crosby in 2004). Street continued to serve as the closer for the A's in 2006. He finished the season with a 4-4 record, 37 saves, 67 strikeouts, a 3.31 ERA in 70.2 innings pitched, and 11 blown saves. On October 14, Street gave up a walk-off three- run home run to Magglio Ord√≥√±ez of the Detroit Tigers in Game 4 of the 2006 ALCS that ended the A's postseason. Street had a solid season in 2007, despite missing time with an injury. He went 5‚Äì2 with a 2.88 ERA, with 16 saves and 62 strikeouts in 50 innings. Street struggled somewhat with a nagging injury in 2008. After a rough stretch in July and August, he lost his closer position to rookie Brad Ziegler. Street's health and pitching improved, although Ziegler continued to close. =Colorado Rockies= On November 12, 2008, Street was traded to the Colorado Rockies with outfielder Carlos Gonz√°lez and pitcher Greg Smith for outfielder Matt Holliday. He beat out Manny Corpas to earn the role of the Rockies' closing pitcher for the 2009 season.Street Beats Out Corpas for Closing Spot SI.com, April 3, 2009 After poor performances by Street, Corpas was renamed the closer on April 17;Corpas to take over closing duties, Colorado Rockies. Published April 17, 2009. Retrieved April 22, 2009. however, Corpas also pitched poorly, and the closer job was given back to Street on May 1.Harding, Thomas. Let's play musical closers , Colorado Rockies. Published May 1, 2009. Retrieved May 3, 2009. Since that time, Street excelled in the closer role and was a key cog in the Rockies' mid-season run back into the race (16‚Äì1 from June 4 to 22). He finished 2009 with 35 saves in 37 opportunities, a 3.06 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 61.2 innings. After a 2009 season in which he blew only two saves, Street struggled during the playoffs for the Rockies. In Game 4 of the 2009 National League Division Series, Street entered the ninth inning with the Rockies leading 4‚Äì2. He was able to record the first two outs before allowing three runs that gave the Phillies a 5‚Äì4 win and a series victory. Before the 2010 season, Street and the Rockies agreed on a three-year $22.5 million contract with an option for 2013. Street missed the first two-and-a-half months of the season of the 2010 season with shoulder soreness, but on returning to the team he assumed the role of closer. Prior to a game on July 26, 2010, Street was struck in the midsection by a line drive during batting practice. He fainted several times from the pain and needed to be taken off the field in an ambulance, but he avoided the disabled list. Street finished 2010 with 20 saves in 25 opportunities and a 3.61 ERA. Street opened 2011 as the Rockies closer, saving 29 games in 32 opportunities through early August. He suffered a right triceps strain and was sent to the 15-day disabled list on August 12. When he returned, he worked in the role of set-up man while Rafael Betancourt remained as closer. Street finished 2011 with a 3.86 ERA and 55 strike-outs versus 9 walks in 58.1 innings. =San Diego Padres= San Diego Padres in 2013 Street was traded by the Rockies to the San Diego Padres for left hander Nick Schmidt on December 7, 2011. The Padres picked up all but $500,000 of Street's remaining contract, and he moved immediately into the closer role vacated by Heath Bell. Street missed a month with a right shoulder strain, but otherwise had an excellent first half with the Padres. He compiled a 1.13 ERA, was 13 for 13 in converting save opportunities, and did not allow a home run in his 25 games, earning a selection to his first All-Star Game. On July 29, 2012, the Padres and Street agreed to terms on a two-year contract extension with a club option for the 2015 season. On August 10, 2012, Street suffered a strained left calf while fielding the final out of the game and missed the next six weeks. At the time of the injury, he had not allowed a run since June 17. He returned to pitch in three more games at the end of the season, earning his 200th career save in his first game back. His only blown save, loss, and home runs given up for the season (two) all occurred in his final appearance of the year against the San Francisco Giants. Street finished the 2012 season with 23 saves in 24 chances and a 1.85 ERA in 39 innings pitched, striking out 47 against 11 walks. Street had difficulties in the first half of the 2013 season, giving up 10 home runs in 26 innings through June 23. But he followed that with a streak of 20 scoreless innings from June 26 through September 3, earning the National League Player of the Week honor for the week ending September 8. Street appeared in 58 games in 2013, missing only a couple weeks in early June with a calf strain. He converted 33 of 35 save opportunities and posted a 2.70 ERA, striking out 46 and walking 14 in 56 innings. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels= On July 19, 2014, Street was traded to the Los Angeles Angels with Trevor Gott in exchange for Taylor Lindsey, Jos√© Rond√≥n, R. J. Alvarez, and Elliot Morris. After joining the Angels, Street recorded 10 saves in a row without allowing any runs, providing a huge upgrade for the struggling Angels bullpen. In May 2015, Street signed a two-year contract extension with the Angels worth $18 million. On July 22, 2015, Street recorded his 300th career save in a victory over the Minnesota Twins, becoming the 27th pitcher all time to reach the 300 saves milestone. After struggling for most of the 2016 season, Street was ruled out for the remainder of the year after undergoing right knee surgery on August 24. Street was activated from the disabled list on June 22, 2017 to play for the first time since 2016. He made his season debut on June 23, pitching a scoreless inning with one strikeout. He went back on the disabled list and was ruled out for the season, only pitching in 4 games. On March 29, 2018, Street announced his retirement from Major League Baseball on Twitter after battling injuries for the previous two seasons. Scouting As opposed to many other closers who are power pitchers, Street was a finesse pitcher. Street's fastball usually hovered in the 88-92 mph range, but it had exceptional tailing movement. He also featured a sharp slider at 84‚Äì86 mph that he used frequently against righties, as well as a good circle changeup at around the 82‚Äì84 mph range with splitter-like movement that he used effectively against lefties. Personal life Street's father was former University of Texas quarterback James Street, and his brother Juston Street was previously a pitcher for the minor league Vancouver Canadians. Street and his wife, Lacey, have three sons named Ripken Rae Street, Ryder James Street, and Rafe William Street.

DeCarava received early critical acclaim for his photography, initially engaging and imaging the lives of African Americans and jazz musicians in the communities where he lived and worked. Over a career that spanned nearly six decades, DeCarava came to be known as a founder in the field of black and white fine art photography, advocating for an approach to the medium based on the core value of an individual, subjective creative sensibility, which was separate and distinct from the \\"social documentary\\" style of many predecessors.  Early life and education  Roy DeCarava was born in Harlem, New York on December 9, 1919. DeCarava came of age during the Harlem Renaissance, when artistic activity and achievement among African Americans flourished across the literary, musical, dramatic, and visual arts. After graduating from Textile High School in New York City in 1938, DeCarava independently began working as a visual artist. He continued his formal education at Cooper Union (1938‚Äì1940), where he studied painting, architecture, and sculpture. DeCarava expanded upon this early training at the Harlem Art Center (1940‚Äì1942) as well as the George Washington Carver Art School, where in addition to painting he began to experiment with printmaking. DeCarava first began to use photography as a means to record and as reference for his paintings, but was so enthralled by the medium that he began devoting all of his time to it and championed black and white silver gelatin photography as an art form of its own. He used his camera to produce striking studies of everyday black life in Harlem, capturing the varied textures of the neighborhood and the creative efflorescence of the Harlem Renaissance. Resisting explicit politicization, DeCarava used photography to counter what he described as ‚Äúblack people...not being portrayed in a serious and artistic way.‚Äù DeCavara was drafted in the Army in 1942, where he would first be sent to Virginia, and then stationed in Fort Claiborne, Louisiana, in the Jim Crow South. There, DeCarava experienced racism so intense that he broke down. In Peter Galassi's biographical essay for the MoMA show, the artist recalled: \\"The only place that wasn‚Äôt segregated in the army was the psychiatric ward of the hospital. I was there for about a month. I was in the army for about six or seven months altogether, but I had nightmares about it for twenty years.\\" Career in fine art photography DeCarava produced five published art books, including The Sound I Saw and The Sweet Flypaper of Life, as well as landmark museum catalogs and retrospective surveys from the Friends of Photography and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes, The Sweet Flypaper of Life. Washington DC: Howard University Press, 1984 (reprint).\\"Museum of Modern Art\\", American Visions, December 1999. Accessed August 23, 2009. The subject of at least 15 solo art exhibitions, DeCarava was the first African-American photographer to win a Guggenheim Fellowship and as a result of the fellowship, was able to photograph his community and New York City for one year; expressing early creative impressions through the black and white silver gelatin process. His first photo exhibit was in 1950, at the Forty-Fourth Street Gallery in New York City, and he soon found a mentor in Edward Steichen, director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art. Gradually, DeCarava became known for his dedication to the field of visual art and for his own work within it, including many distinctive black and white, silver gelatin photographs of great American musicians. His work also appeared on several record album covers, such as Porgy and Bess, by Miles Davis, Bless this House, by Mahalia Jackson, Flamenco Fire by Carlos Montoya, and Big Bill's Blues, by Big Bill Broonzy. DeCarava received honorary degrees from Rhode Island School of Design, the Maryland Institute of Art, Wesleyan University, The New School for Social Research, The Parsons School of Design and the Art Institute of Boston for contributions to American art. In 2006, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts from the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest award given to artists by the United States Government.National Endowment for the Arts. 2006 National Medal of Arts. Roy DeCarava. Photographer, New York . Accessed August 23, 2009. DeCarava encouraged other fine art photographers and believed in the accessibility of the medium. From 1955 to 1957, at his own expense, he established and supported A Photographer's Gallery in his apartment in a brownstone block at 48 West 85th Street, New York, in which was shown artwork by the great names of American photography of the period. In 1963, he co-founded and became the first director of the Kamoinge Workshop, a Harlem-Based collective that supported the work of black photographers through exhibitions, public programs, group critiques, and published portfolios. In 1972 DeCarava received the Benin Creative Photography Award for his contributions to the black community as a creative photographer. DeCarava died in New York City, on October 27, 2009.Abbie Fentress Swanson, \\"Photographer Roy DeCarava Dies at 89\\", WQXR News, October 30, 2009.  Art historical context and commentary  Coming of age in the 1940s, DeCarava appears nothing short of iconoclastic in both his approach to photography, a medium strenuously identified with evidentiary truth, and in his aesthetic ambitions to, as he said, ‚Äúbreak through a kind of literalness,‚Äù and ‚Äúexpress some things I felt.‚Äù Maintaining his quest to create a visually autonomous photographic subject of color, DeCarava endured decades of embittering misunderstanding. He has pointed out over and over that despite his ‚Äúreputation as a documentar[y] photographer, ‚Ä¶ I really never was,‚Äù and reiterated his steadfastly modernist concern to achieve ‚Äúa creative expression,‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúdocumentary or sociological statement.‚Äù While DeCarava never worked in the field of cinema himself, he grew up in the era of black-and-white filmmaking and, in an interview much later in his career, noted, ‚ÄúI think I absorbed the visual aesthetic of black- and-white films, so that when I started taking pictures, it was natural.‚Äù His largest work is Roy DeCarava: A Retrospective, over 200 black and white photos spanning the late 1940s to the 1990s. Another work is The Sweet Flypaper of Life. Published in 1955, it is a pictorial narrative of family life in Harlem with photographs by DeCarava and text by Langston Hughes. DeCarava wrote ‚Äùin spite of poverty, you see people with dignity and a certain quality that contrasts with where they live and what they‚Äôre doing.‚ÄùRobinson, Fern. \\"MASTERFUL AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER ROY DECARAVA.\\" American Visions, vol. 14, no. 6, 1999, p. 20.

Characteristics  NGC 1365 is barred spiral galaxy in the Fornax cluster. Within the larger long bar stretching across the center of the galaxy appears to be a smaller bar that comprises the core, with an apparent size of about 50‚Ä≥ √ó 40‚Ä≥. This second bar is more prominent in infrared images of the central region of the galaxy, and likely arises from a combination of dynamical instabilities of stellar orbits in the region, along with gravity, density waves, and the overall rotation of the disc. The inner bar structure likely rotates as a whole more rapidly than the larger long bar, creating the diagonal shape seen in images. The spiral arms extend in a wide curve north and south from the ends of the east-west bar and form an almost ring like Z-shaped halo. Astronomers think NGC 1365's prominent bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution, drawing gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom and ultimately feeding material into the central black hole. NGC 1365, including its two outer spiral arms, spreads over around 200,000 light-years. Different parts of the galaxy take different times to make a full rotation around the core of the galaxy, with the outer parts of the bar completing one circuit in about 350 million years. NGC 1365 and other galaxies of its type have come to more prominence in recent years with new observations indicating that the Milky Way could also be a barred spiral galaxy. Such galaxies are quite common ‚Äî two thirds of spiral galaxies are barred according to recent estimates, and studying others can help astronomers understand our own galactic home. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The value of forward secrecy is that it protects past communication. This reduces the motivation for attackers to compromise keys. For instance, if an attacker learns a long-term key, but the compromise is detected and the long-term key is revoked and updated, relatively little information is leaked in a forward secure system. The value of forward secrecy depends on the assumed capabilities of an adversary. Forward secrecy has value if an adversary is assumed to be able to obtain secret keys from a device (read access) but is either detected or unable to modify the way session keys are generated in the device (full compromise). In some cases an adversary who can read long-term keys from a device may also be able to modify the functioning of the session key generator, as in the backdoored Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator. If an adversay can make the random number generator predictable past traffic will be protected but all future traffic will be compromised. The value of forward secrecy is limited not only by the assumption that an adversary will attack a server by only stealing keys and not modifying the random number generator used by the server but it is also limited by the assumption that the adversary will only passively collect traffic on the communications link and not be active using a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Forward secrecy typically uses an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to prevent reading past traffic. The ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange is often signed by the server using a static signing key. If an adversary can steal (or obtain through a court order) this static (long term) signing key, the adverary can masqerade as the server to the client and as the client to the server and implement a classic Man-in-the-Middle attack. History The term \\"perfect forward secrecy\\" was coined by C. G. G√ºnther in 1990 and further discussed by Whitfield Diffie, Paul van Oorschot, and Michael James Wiener in 1992 where it was used to describe a property of the Station- to-Station protocol. Forward secrecy has also been used to describe the analogous property of password-authenticated key agreement protocols where the long-term secret is a (shared) password. In 2000 the IEEE first ratified IEEE 1363, which establishes the related one-party and two-party forward secrecy properties of various standard key agreement schemes. Definition An encryption system has the property of forward secrecy if plain-text (decrypted) inspection of the data exchange that occurs during key agreement phase of session initiation does not reveal the key that was used to encrypt the remainder of the session. Example The following is a hypothetical example of a simple instant messaging protocol that employs forward secrecy: # Alice and Bob each generate a pair of long-term, asymmetric public and private keys, then verify public-key fingerprints in person or over an already- authenticated channel. Verification establishes with confidence that the claimed owner of a public key is the actual owner. # Alice and Bob use a key exchange algorithm such as Diffie‚ÄìHellman, to securely agree on an ephemeral session key. They use the keys from step 1 only to authenticate one another during this process. # Alice sends Bob a message, encrypting it with a symmetric cipher using the session key negotiated in step 2. # Bob decrypts Alice's message using the key negotiated in step 2. # The process repeats for each new message sent, starting from step 2 (and switching Alice and Bob's roles as sender/receiver as appropriate). Step 1 is never repeated. Forward secrecy (achieved by generating new session keys for each message) ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if one of the keys generated in an iteration of step 2 is compromised, since such a key is only used to encrypt a single message. Forward secrecy also ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if the long-term private keys from step 1 are compromised. However, masquerading as Alice or Bob would be possible going forward if this occurred, possibly compromising all future messages. Attacks Forward secrecy is designed to prevent the compromise of a long- term secret key from affecting the confidentiality of past conversations. However, forward secrecy cannot defend against a successful cryptanalysis of the underlying ciphers being used, since a cryptanalysis consists of finding a way to decrypt an encrypted message without the key, and forward secrecy only protects keys, not the ciphers themselves. A patient attacker can capture a conversation whose confidentiality is protected through the use of public-key cryptography and wait until the underlying cipher is broken (e.g. large quantum computers could be created which allow the discrete logarithm problem to be computed quickly). This would allow the recovery of old plaintexts even in a system employing forward secrecy.  Weak perfect forward secrecy  Weak perfect forward secrecy (wPFS) is the weaker property whereby when agents' long-term keys are compromised, the secrecy of previously established session- keys is guaranteed, but only for sessions in which the adversary did not actively interfere. This new notion, and the distinction between this and forward secrecy was introduced by Hugo Krawczyk in 2005. This weaker definition implicitly requires that full (perfect) forward secrecy maintains the secrecy of previously established session keys even in sessions where the adversary did actively interfere, or attempted to act as a man in the middle. Protocols Forward secrecy is present in several major protocol implementations, such as SSH and as an optional feature in IPsec (RFC 2412). Off-the-Record Messaging, a cryptography protocol and library for many instant messaging clients, provides forward secrecy as well as deniable encryption. In Transport Layer Security (TLS), cipher suites based on Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange (DHE-RSA, DHE-DSA) and elliptic curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange (ECDHE-RSA, ECDHE-ECDSA) are available. In theory, TLS can choose appropriate ciphers since SSLv3, but in everyday practice many implementations have refused to offer forward secrecy or only provide it with very low encryption grade.Discussion on the TLS mailing list in October 2007 TLS 1.3 leaves ephemeral Diffie‚ÄìHellman as the only key exchange mechanism to provide forward secrecy. OpenSSL supports forward secrecy using elliptic curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman since version 1.0, with a computational overhead of approximately 15% for the initial handshake. The Signal Protocol uses the Double Ratchet Algorithm to provide forward secrecy. On the other hand, among popular protocols currently in use, WPA does not support forward secrecy. Use Forward secrecy is seen as an important security feature by several large Internet information providers. Since late 2011, Google provided forward secrecy with TLS by default to users of its Gmail service, Google Docs service, and encrypted search services. Since November 2013, Twitter provided forward secrecy with TLS to its users. Wikis hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation have all provided forward secrecy to users since July 2014 and are requiring the use of forward secrecy since August 2018. Facebook reported as part of an investigation into email encryption that, as of May 2014, 74% of hosts that support STARTTLS also provide forward secrecy. TLS 1.3, published in August 2018, dropped support for ciphers without forward secrecy. , 96.6% of web servers surveyed support some form of forward secrecy, and 52.1% will use forward secrecy with most browsers. At WWDC 2016, Apple announced that all iOS apps would need to use App Transport Security (ATS), a feature which enforces the use of HTTPS transmission. Specifically, ATS requires the use of an encryption cipher that provides forward secrecy.https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016198-SW14 ATS became mandatory for apps on January 1, 2017. The Signal messaging application employs forward secrecy in its protocol, notably differentiating it from messaging protocols based on PGP. German security-focused email provider Mailbox.org uses PFS and HSTS for messages in transit.

In the 1820s, Black Rock was the rival of Buffalo for the terminus of the Erie Canal, but Buffalo, with its larger harbor capacity and greater distance from the shores of Canada, a recent antagonist during the War of 1812, won the competition. Black Rock took its name from a large outcropping of black limestone along the Niagara River, which was blasted away in the early 1820s to make way for the canal. History In spite of losing the Erie Canal terminus to Buffalo and twice being burned to the ground by the British during the War of 1812, Black Rock continued to prosper. In 1814, a small group of American riflemen defended Black Rock and neighboring Buffalo from a British assault and, in 1839, it was incorporated as a town. In 1853, the City of Buffalo annexed the town of Black Rock. Because of its strategic position across the Niagara River from Canada, Black Rock was an important crossing place for African-Americans escaping slavery via the Underground Railroad. This heritage is celebrated with an annual Underground Railroad Re-Enactment at Broderick Park on Unity Island at Niagara and West Ferry Streets, the site of a ferry crossing prior to the construction of passenger bridges. The area's first industry was shipbuilding, later supplanted by foundries, manufacturing, and canal commerce. Today Black Rock boasts some pre-annexation houses and many excellent, often vacant examples of early 20th century brick and masonry industrial architecture. Black Rock's history is amply documented in the library collections of the Buffalo History Museum. The Market Square Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. =Railroad link= In the 1870s, the International Railway Bridge connected the two nations at Black Rock, an engineering marvel at the time. The Black Rock Rail Yard handled both passenger service and commercial transport of goods into and out of Canada. Following the completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the construction of the United States's Interstate Highway system, Canada's Queen Elizabeth Highway, and the increase of commercial air travel, the Black Rock Rail Yard lost its passenger service and later most of its commercial freight service. The railroad bridge, however, remains in heavy usage and is one of the most important rail crossings between the United States and Canada. =Prominent residents= Black Rock's best-known resident was American poet Robert Creeley, who lived with his family in a converted firehouse at the corner of Amherst and East Streets from 1990 to 2003. Another prominent resident was US Secretary of War Peter Buell Porter. Current residents include prominent Buffalo architect Max Willig who lives in the historic Amherst National Bank Building at the corner of Amherst and Germain Streets. Former US Congressman John M. Holley lived in Black Rock.

The original series was first published for arcades in January 1996. The game features fast, action- oriented gameplay requiring quick reflexes. It has seen four iterations to date and has been ported to several video game consoles. The mecha designs for all installments of the series were created by robot designer Hajime Katoki. Related merchandise released for sale include plastic models, original soundtracks, trading figurines, light novels and audio drama CDs.  Games  The games in the series are as follows. ;Virtual On: Cyber Troopers (Virtual- On: Operation Moongate) :Released between 1995 and 1996 for arcades, Sega Saturn, and PC. The Saturn version of the game is one of few games that supports the SEGA Net on the console. It also features the Sega Twin Stick Peripheral. The game features M.S.B.S. v3.3 (Arcade), v3.3s (Sega Saturn) and v.3.3w (Windows PC), among others. ;Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram :Released between 1998 and 2000 for arcades and Sega Dreamcast, with special peripheral device, the Twin Sticks, and in 2009 for Microsoft Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service. Very few VOOT arcade units made it outside Japan. The US release of VOOT on Dreamcast had many features locked for unknown reasons, such as Cable Versus and Custom Virtuaroid, and the game was not released in Europe. Later versions for the arcade incorporated a VMU slot for imported colours created on the Japanese version of VOOT on Sega Dreamcast. The game features M.S.B.S. v5.2 (Early Arcade), v5.4 (Arcade), v.5.45 (Sega Dreamcast), v5.6 (Rare Bonus disc addon) and 5.66 (Late Arcade and Xbox 360 XBLA). ;Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Force :Released exclusively in Japanese arcades in 2001. It was the first game in the series to be released after AM3 was renamed to Hitmaker, and features a new system of gameplay where players are teamed up in pairs to oppose another pair, with a leader/subordinate ruleset. The machines use a card system found in other arcade machines to keep player data. The game features M.S.B.S. v7.5, v7.6 and v7.7. The game is later released on the Xbox 360 on December 22, 2010. ;Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Marz :First released in Japan and the United States in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, and was rereleased on PlayStation 3 in Japan in 2013. It uses the VO: Force rules for gameplay and graphics, and is the first Virtual On game to have a single player story mode, which follows on with the Virtual-On universe. As the PlayStation 2 has no official Twin Sticks, the game's controls rely on the DualShock controllers (this was corrected in PS3 rerelease with twin-stick peripheral configuration). As inclusion of story mode, this game is regarded more as an action-adventure game than simply an action game. The game features M.S.B.S. v8.5. ;A Certain Magical Virtual-On :First released in Japan for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in 2018. The game is a collaboration between Sega and Dengeki Bunko, featuring characters from Kazuma Kamachi's light novel series A Certain Magical Index. The game features M.S.B.S. v55.55.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-03-12/sega-dengeki-bunko- develop-a-certain-magical-virtual-on-collaboration-game-for-ps4-ps- vita/.113324 It was released on February 15, 2018.  Overview  Virtual-On features mecha called Virtuaroids, or VRs, that are large robots the player controls in battles against enemy VRs, and its twin-stick control, in which two joysticks, complemented by an array of controls, are used by players. Additionally, in the plot of the first game, Virtual On: Cyber Troopers, the Virtual-On's arcade machine is actually a remote operation device sent from the future in search of \\"Virtual-On Positive\\" (VO+) pilots.  Plastic models  The first plastic model series based on Virtuaroid was released shortly before Japanese release of Oratorio Tangram, and were made by Wave Corporation. These Virtuaroid models are borrowed from Operation Moongate as well as Oratorio Tangram, One Man Rescue and Fragmentary Passage. These models were also made by Kotobukiya, which is well known for making plastic models of Medabots anime and manga series. Hasegawa Corporation also manufactures the plastic model kits of Virtuaroids from Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Force and Marz video games. Some Virtuaroids, which were originally available only in a few version, were expanded to including spinoffs, such as Virtuaroid Guarayakha with special equipment, and more alternate-colored versions of some Virtuaroids. As of 2014, plastic models of Virtual On franchise are still in production.  Appearances in other media  The Virtuaroids Temjin 747J, Ahparmd the HA-T and Fei-Yen the Knight from the Virtual-On series appeared in the Japanese, turn-based strategy game Super Robot Wars Alpha 3. This was the first occasion of characters from a video game series, owned neither by Banpresto nor their parent company Namco Bandai, appearing in a Super Robot Wars game. Of note about the game is that if the other pilots in the game remove their suits, approach the Virtuaroids and try to speak to their pilots, the Virtuaroids would say that they were being remote-piloted by pilots in another plane or dimension. In the PSP rhythm-action game Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Extend, the third game in the Project DIVA series, one of the available outfits for Miku to wear was based on Fei-Yen. The special outfit was later made into plastic model figure. A reference to Virtual On can be found in 21st episode of Hy≈çka anime, where H≈çtar≈ç and Satoshi play the Operation Moongate with the Virtuaroids Raiden and Viper II respectively. Temjin and Fei-Yen appeared in Senko No Ronde 2 as selectable characters via downloadable content. An emulated version of the original Virtual On arcade game can be played at the in-game arcade in Yakuza Kiwami 2.

Species have been described from all groups of tetrapod vertebrates, as well as a wide range of haematophagous arthropods, which serve as both the vectors and definitive hosts of the parasite. By far the most biodiverse and prevalent of all haemogregarines, the genus is distinguished by its unique reciprocal trophic lifecycle which lacks the salivary transmission between hosts commonly associated with other apicomplexans. While particularly prevalent in amphibians and reptiles, the genus is more well known in veterinary circles for causing a tick-borne disease called hepatozoonosis in some mammals.  Lifecycle  Hepatozoon species in the blood of reptiles Members of the genus Hepatozoon possess particularly complex lifecycles which vary considerably among species. Sexual reproduction and sporogenic development occur within the haemocoel of the invertebrate host, which is subsequently consumed by the vertebrate host. The sporozoites then migrate to the liver of the vertebrate, where they undergo multiple fission (asexual reproduction) to produce merozoites. The meronts are released into the bloodstream where they form gametocytes, the final stage of development within the vertebrate host. The gamonts are large, conspicuous organisms which occupy a significant portion of the erythrocyte, and are easily visible on simple blood films. When the invertebrate vector feeds on the blood of the infected vertebrate, the gamonts are taken up into the gut once more, where they undergo gametogenesis and the cycle begins once more. This simplified lifecycle is, of course, insufficient for species which infect vertebrate and invertebrate hosts which do not directly feed on one another, necessitating an even more complex cycle. For instance, Hepatozoon sipedon infects mosquitoes and snakes, but since snakes do not typically feed on mosquitoes, a third, intermediate host is required, in this case a frog. The frog ingests the infected mosquito, and the snake acquires the infection by feeding on the now-infected frog. Another mosquito can then feed on the snake, thus continuing the lifecycle. Hepatozoonosis, therefore, results when an animal eats an infected tick - the disease is not spread by tick bites. Species include Hepatozoon muris and Hepatozoon canis, which typically infects mice and dogs, respectively, and Hepatozoon atticorae, which is found in birds.

History In September 1983, the station first signed on as KNOI.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page D-273 It was owned by Tri-County Broadcasting and aired an adult contemporary music format. The power at first was only 3,000 watts, so it did not reach most of the Spokane radio market from its Deer Park location. KAZZ logo until 2009 On April 1, 1986, the station was assigned the KAZZ call sign by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The station featured veteran 1970s WHYI Miami DJs Mark In The Dark and Big Al, and also included local radio veterans JP Bzet and Dean Jaxson. The station for a time aired a children's radio format, as a Radio AAHS Network affiliate, the only FM station on the network. According to the FCC records, the station went dark on June 4, 2008. On June 16, 2008, it applied for special temporary authority (STA) to \\"remain silent\\" which was granted on July 9, 2008. The reason given in the application was \\"a secured creditor has seized transmitting equipment necessary to the operation of the station.\\" Per the FCC notification, KAZZ's license would automatically expire as a matter of law if broadcast operations did not resume by 12:01 a.m. on June 5, 2009. KAZZ stayed off the air for almost a year. In May 2009, an application was filed with the FCC for the involuntary assignment of the KAZZ broadcast license from Proactive Communications, Inc., to Nancy L. Isserlis, acting as receiver for KAZZ.

It was known as Clayton County Airport ‚Äì Tara Field, which was the name still used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) until 2011. The airport was renamed Atlanta South Regional Airport, which was approved by the airport board of commissioners in December 2011, and was approved by the GDOT and the FAA before it went into effect. It was also known as Henry County Airport from 2013 to 2017. Although the airport is located in Henry County, it was owned and operated by Clayton County to the north from 1992 until 2011. It is not near most of that county, except for its very small southern tip. The north end of Clayton County has part of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, thus Tara Field served general aviation, especially for the Atlanta Motor Speedway immediately next to it. At its July 12, 2011 meeting, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners voted to sell the airport to Henry County in a deal worth $17.7 million. The Henry County Board of Commissioners agreed to the purchase at a meeting on July 13, 2011, and the sale was completed in August 2011. Henry County paid just $2.7 million toward the purchase price, with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Georgia Department of Transportation funding the balance of $15 million. The Henry County Board of Commissioners voted Tuesday, December 4, 2012 to move forward with the runway expansion project, which extended the runway to 5,500 feet and widened it by 25 feet. The project was complete in time for the Labor Day race at Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. There is no weather station or FAA flight info reported for this airport. On April 15 2013, the airport runway was closed for 2 months to allow for construction on widening of the runway. Phase I of the Airport Expansion began in February 2013 and was completed for the 2013 NASCAR weekend at the nearby Speedway. Expansion consisted of adding 1,000 feet to the 24 end and widening the existing runway 25 feet. At the completion of Phase I, the new runway will be 5,503 feet long by 100 feet wide.  History  The airport was originally named Bear Creek Airport and was built in the late 60's and operated by a Mr. Morris. In July 2005, the airport and the adjacent speedway were hit by an F2 tornado on the evening of July 6. Millions of dollars in damage was done to the airport, in addition to the tens of millions at the speedway. Four airplanes were flipped over, hangars were torn apart, and fiberglass insulation and sheet metal were plastered into iron fences, along with another plane. The storm was a result of Hurricane Cindy, after it had already been downgraded to a tropical depression after landfall. Another severe thunderstorm struck in 2014, causing a downburst with winds at minimal hurricane strength on the evening of September 7th. Planes were again flipped over, destroying six of them and damaging another 15, in addition to relatively minor damage to some hangar doors and other airport facilities. The airport has changed its ID from 4A7 to KHMP. In 2013 the county changed the facility‚Äôs name from Atlanta South Regional Airport to Henry County Airport, and again in 2017 to Atlanta Speedway Airport, owing it to be across the street from Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Turns 1 and 2 are overlook the runway. Speedway Motorsports officials have indicated that they will allow the county to use the new name which identifies the airport more closely with the race track facility (aircraft used by teams will fly into the airport), and it will also help increase visibility around the United States for economic development purposes.  Facilities and aircraft  The airport covers an area of 160 acres (65 ha) at an elevation of 874 feet (266 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 6/24 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,500 by 75 feet (1,676 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending June 9, 2011, the airport had 42,000 aircraft operations, an average of 115 per day: 96% general aviation and 4% air taxi. At that time there were 93 aircraft based at this airport: 63% single-engine, 15% multi-engine, 4% jet, 14% helicopter, and 3% ultralight.

Forward air control is the provision of guidance to close air support (CAS) aircraft intended to ensure that their attack hits the intended target and does not injure friendly troops. This task is carried out by a forward air controller (FAC). A primary forward air control function is ensuring the safety of friendly troops during close air support. Enemy targets in the front line (\\"Forward Edge of the Battle Area\\" in US terminology) are often close to friendly forces and therefore friendly forces are at risk of friendly fire through proximity during air attack. The danger is twofold: the bombing pilot cannot identify the target clearly, and is not aware of the locations of friendly forces. Camouflage, a constantly changing situation and the fog of war all increase the risk. Present day doctrine holds that Forward Air Controllers (FACs) are not needed for air interdiction, although there has been such use of FACs in the past. An additional concern of forward air controllers is the avoidance of harm to noncombatants in the strike area. Early air ground support efforts Even as close air support began during World War I, there were pioneer attempts to direct the trench strafing by the ground troops marking their positions by laying out signal panels on the ground, firing flares, or lighting smoke signals. Aircrews had difficulty communicating with the ground troops; they would drop messages or use messenger pigeons.Hallion, pp. 20 - 21, 38 - 40. Benno Fiala von Fernbrugg, an Austro-Hungarian pilot, pioneered the use of radio for fire control; at the Battle of Gorlice he used a radio transmitter in his airplane to send changes via morse code to an artillery battery on the ground.Chant, p. 86. Colonel Billy Mitchell also equipped his Spad XVI command airplane with a radio, and the Germans experimented with radios in their Junkers J.I all-metal-structure, armored-fuselage sesquiplanes.Hallion, p. 21. The Marines in the so-called Banana wars of the 1920s and 1930s used Curtiss Falcons and Vought Corsairs that were equipped with radios powered by airstream-driven generators, with a range of up to 50 miles. Another method of communication was for the pilot to drop messages in a weighted container, and to swoop in and pick up messages hung out by ground troops on a \\"clothesline\\" between poles. The objective was aerial reconnaissance and air attack. Using these various methods, the Marine pilots combined the functions of both FAC and strike aircraft, as they carried out their own air attacks on the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in 1927. The commonality of pilots and ground troops belonging to the same service led to a close air support role similar to that sought by use of FACs, without the actual use of a FAC.Hallion, pp. 70 - 74. On 27 October 1927, a Marine patrol used cloth panels to direct an air strike‚Äîarguably the first forward air control mission.Churchill, p. 2. This distinctive U.S. Marine doctrine of interaction between Marine infantry and aviation would persist, recurring in the Korean War and the Vietnam War.Lester, p. 7. French colonial operations in the Rif War from 1920‚Äì1926 used air power similarly to the Marines in Nicaragua against the Sandinistas but in a different environment, the desert. The French Mobile Groups of combined arms not only used aircraft for scouting and air attack; the airplanes carried trained artillery officers as observers. These aerial observers called in artillery fire via radio.Hallion, pp. 69 - 70. The German military noted close air support operations in the Spanish Civil War and decided to develop its forward air control capability. By 1939, they had forward air control teams called Ground Attack Teams attached to every headquarters from regiment level upwards. These Teams directed air strikes flown by Luftwaffe close air support units. Extensive coordinated training by air and ground troops had raised this system to state of the art by the beginning of World War II.Shlight, pp. 29, 32. When the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was founded on 20 June 1941, it included provisions for Air Ground Control Parties to serve with the United States Army at the division, corps, and Army headquarters. The Air Ground Control Parties functions were to regulate bombing and artillery in close conjunction with the ground troops, as well as assess bomb damage. They were thus the first of similar units to try to fulfill the functions of the FAC without being airborne.Churchill, pp. 1 - 2. However, these units were often plagued by turf wars and cumbersome communications between the respective armies and air forces involved. As a result, it could take hours for an air strike requested by ground troops to actually show up.Hallion, pp. 149 - 150. World War II However, forward air control during World War II came into existence as a result of exigency, and was used in several theaters of World War II. Its reincarnation in action was a result of field expedience rather than planned operations.Churchill, p. 5. British Mobile Fighter Controllers operating in North Africa during World War II In the Pacific Theater, 4 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force began forward air control at the Battle of Buna-Gona, New Guinea in November 1942. The RAAF continued forward air control in the Pacific for the rest of the war. By November 1943, the U.S. Marines were using forward air control during the Battle of Bougainville. On the Allied side in the European Theater, British forces in North Africa campaign began using the Forward Air Support Links, a \\"tentacle\\" system that used radio links from front line units to the rear requesting close air support from the next \\"cab rank\\" of on-call airborne fighter-bombers. The requesting unit would direct the air strikes. The U.S. Army would not copy the British system until the Allied invasion of Italy, but adapted it for use there and in France after the Invasion of Normandy of 6 June 1944.Gooderson, p. 26. The United States would end World War II still without an air control doctrine. When the U.S. Air Force split from the U.S. Army in 1947, neither took on the responsibility for forward air control; the U.S. military thus had no functional forward air control when the Korean War broke out. Post World War II =British Commonwealth operations= The United Kingdom and Commonwealth continued to build on their experience in the Second World War in various campaigns around the world in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Malayan Emergency, the Suez Crisis,Cossey, page not given. the Indonesian Confrontation and operations in Aden and Oman., Colin Richardson, Mapping the coast of Mahra, The British- Yemeni Society, The British-Yemeni Society, 2005. Retrieved 1 October 2015. With the re-formation of the Army Air Corps in 1957 this new corps's functions included airborne forward air control. Korean War Although the United States, as part of the United Nations Command (UNC) in the Korean War, entered the war on 26 June 1950 with no forward air controllers, it rapidly improvised close air support procedures for UNC forces. By 20 July, jury-rigged systems were not only controlling air strikes against the communist foe, but also occasionally directing aerial interceptions of opposing aircraft.Futrell, pp. 98 - 102, 425 - 426. Both the U.S. high command and North Korean General Nam Il agreed that only tactical air power saved United Nation forces from defeat during the mobile warfare stage of the war.Schlight, p. 122.Futrell, pp. 148 - 152, 371 - 372. When the front lines bogged down into static trench warfare in Summer 1951, forward air control diminished in importance. To cope with the communist switch to night operations, both radar and Shoran bombing techniques were developed. However, close air support continued, and sometimes used to direct interdiction missions against the communist lines of communications.Futrell, pp. 332 - 333. By this time, Allied air forces were contributing a considerable portion of the tactical air strikes.Futrell, pp. 4, 232, 258, 461 - 462, 517, 538 - 539, 561. By the cessation of hostilities, airborne forward air controllers alone were credited with flying 40,354 forward air control sorties, and directing air strikes that killed an estimated 184,808 communist troops.Futrell, p. 692. At times, tactical air was credited with inflicting about half of all communist casualties.Futrell, pp. 168 - 175. Despite having agreed on a common forward air control doctrine as embodied in Field Manual 31 - 35 Air-Ground Operations,Schlight, pp. 71 - 105. a turf war over doctrine raged between the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army for the entire war. Additionally, the U.S. Marine Corps maintained its own FAC operation during the war. Also, U.S. Navy carrier aviation would not completely coordinate its operations with the Air Force/Army system until the final month of the war. With no common doctrine agreed upon during the war, forward air control systems were shut down postwar in 1956.Churchill, pp. 6 - 9.Schlight, pp. 174 -177.Lester, pp. 74 - 77. Vietnam War L-19/O-1 Bird Dog, used by Forward Air Controllers during the Vietnam War. Forward air controllers played a major part in the largest bombing campaign in history during the Vietnam War. While World War II had featured indiscriminate mass air raids on major cities worldwide, bombing during the Vietnam War was aimed at smaller targets in a country the size of New Mexico. Unless bombs were dropped in a free fire zone, or on a pre-briefed target, the bombing in Vietnam was directed by FACs. Also unlike World War II, serious efforts were made to avoid hitting the civilian populace, which also called for FAC intervention.Dunnigan, Nofi, pp. 106 - 107.CIA World Factbook Retrieved 17 September 2015. =Reinvention of forward air control= In 1961, when forward air control was revived, it promptly ran into the recurring problems of unreliable radios, a shortage of supplies, lack of suitable aircraft, differing concepts of close air support,Rowley (1972), pp. 37 - 50, 62, 64, 66, 72 - 84. and unfavorable terrain.Churchill, pp. 15 - 16, 24.Walton, p. 31. The first manning requirement for FACs, levied in 1962, amounted to 32 slots in Vietnam. Even as the slots slowly filled, the requirement proved inadequate.Rowley (1972), pp. 25 - 26. The 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron was then assigned in-country in mid-1963 to augment the FAC force.Rowley (1972), p. 30. By January 1965, there were still only 144 USAF FACs in Southeast Asia.Walton, p. 36. While the U.S. Air Force would continue to add more FACs, projecting a need for 831 FACs, and stationing four more Tactical Air Support Squadrons in Southeast Asia by April 1965, the manning levels of assigned FACs would run about 70% of need until December 1969.Churchill, p. 36.Rowley (1975), p. 10. Other branches of the U.S. military also had FACs; the U.S. Army had at least two aviation companies of FACs,Hooper, p. 2.Rowley (1972), pp. 45 - 46. the U.S. Marine Corps had an organic FAC squadron within its forces, and the U.S. Navy established its own FAC squadron in the Mekong Delta.Walton, pp. 44 - 47. U.S. involvement had begun with a South Vietnamese FAC training program;Rowley (1972), pp. 21 - 27.Walton, pp. 27 - 28. later in the war, Laotians and Hmong were also trained as FACs.Churchill, p. 12. =Technological developments= There was a great deal of technical innovation in forward air control operations during the course of the Vietnam War. The United States came up with a number of ways to make its forward air control system more effective. As early as 1962, Douglas C-47 flareship FACs began the forward air control mission in South Vietnam, mostly on night missions.Anthony, p. 6. In September 1965, another C-47 went into action as the first Airborne Command and Control Center. As additional ABCCC aircraft were added, they would constantly govern the air war in Southeast Asia.Project CHECO ABCCC Report, pp. 2, 11. Retrieved 20 September 2015. By early 1966, a rising level of communist anti-aircraft fire against propeller-driven FAC aircraft necessitated the use of jet aircraft for FACs in high-risk areas in North Vietnam. The Fast FAC mission would supplement the FAC mission in Southeast Asia until war's end.Churchill, pp. 134 - 135. In July 1966, night FAC operations began against the Ho Chi Minh Trail; A-26 Invaders began a dual FAC/strike mission under call sign \\"Nimrod\\".Anthony, p. 100. The U.S. Air Force began Operation Shed Light as a test of night time battlefield illumination.Anthony, pp. 115 - 118. In response to increasing pressure from air strikes, the communists turned entirely to night operations in Vietnam by 1968.Churchill, pp. 15 - 16, 70. C-123 Provider cargo aircraft were used as flareships to light up the Trail and direct air strikes, under the call sign \\"Candlestick\\", until late 1969. Withdrawn in the face of mounting opposition, the flareships would still serve elsewhere in theater until 30 June 1971.Anthony, pp. 134 - 139. In a similar role, Lockheed AC-130 gunships, call sign \\"Blindbat\\", not only lit the Trail and directed air strikes, but used its own copious firepower on enemy trucks.Churchill, pp. 80 - 83. The gunships carried both electronic sensors tied into Operation Igloo White and night observation devices for spotting enemy trucks, as well as a computerized fire control system.Nalty, pp. 54 - 56. On 1 November 1968, President Lyndon Johnson declared a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam. With that act, the focus of the contending forces became the Ho Chi Minh Trail. As the U.S. more than quadrupled the number of airstrikes aimed at interdiction, North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns and gunners transferred south to the Trail to match this new onslaught. Both sides realized that the supply of military necessities being moved south to insurgents would be crucial to a communist victory.Nalty, pp. 6, 98 - 99. At about this time, the Raven FACs began supporting Vang Pao's Central Intelligence Agency-supported guerrilla army on the Plain of Jars in northern Laos with air strikes serving as aerial artillery blasting the way clear for offensive sweeps by the partisans.Anthony, Sexton, p. 271, 298, 301.Robbins, entirety. In early 1970, in an attempt to improve bombing accuracy, the USAF began using laser guided ordnance.Anthony, pp. 147 - 148.Nalty, pp. 57 - 58, 236. =Results= By May 1971, U.S. Air Force intelligence concluded that air strikes had wiped out all the North Vietnamese trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This was a demonstrably untrue conclusion, as trucks still traversed the Trail until the communist victory in 1975.Zeybel, October 1995, \\"Night Spectre Haunts the Ho Chi Minh Trail\\", Vietnam, pp. 38 - 45.Nalty, pp. 300 - 304. After war's end, the U.S. Air Force ended the forward air control mission, just as they had following World War II and Korea.Robbins, p. 411.Lester, p. 194. Indo-Pakistani War Major Atma Singh, of the Indian Army, flying a HAL Krishak, played a crucial part in a close air support defense against steep odds. The Pakistani loss of armor in December 1971 was one of the most severe since the great armored clashes of World War II. Major Singh won the Maha Vir Chakra for his performance under heavy ground fire. Portuguese Overseas War During the Portuguese Overseas War, the Portuguese Air Force used mainly Dornier Do 27 and OGMA/Auster D.5 light aircraft in the forward air control role, in the several theatres of operation: Angola, Portuguese Guinea and Mozambique.

FACs may form part of a Fire Support Team or Tactical Air Control Party, they may be ground based, airborne FACs in fixed- wing aircraft (FAC-A) or in helicopters (ABFAC). Since 2003 the United States Armed Forces have used the term joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) for some of their ground based FACs.Caroline Wyatt, 14 February 2009, \\"Training the RAF's eyes and ears\\", BBC NEWS Retrieved 3 October 2015. NATO is making efforts to increase the safety and reduce the risk of fratricide in air to ground operations. Co-operation between different NATO agencies such as the NATO Standardization Agency and the JAPCC resulted in the development of common standards for Forward Air Controllers and these are now set out in STANAG 3797 (Minimum Qualifications for Forward Air Controllers). NATO FACs are trained to request, plan, brief and execute CAS operations both for Low Level and Medium/High Level operations and their training NATO FACs includes electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defences, enemy air defence, air command and control, attack methods and tactics and weaponeering.

The group was active until Eyedea's death in October 2010. Over the course of just over a decade, the duo had collaborated with many well-known hip hop groups and artists such as Aesop Rock and Sage Francis, playing a prominent role in the emerging underground rap movement. Eyedea's highly successful background work in rap battles, along with his greatly introspective, complex and poetic sense of lyrical integrity heavily influenced E&A;'s distinctive musical output and largely defined the group as a unique and stylistically independent presence within alternative hip hop.  Early beginnings  Eyedea first became known around the local midwest hip hop circuit for his battling and freestyle skills. Eyedea was best known for his victory at the Blaze Battle, which was aired on HBO and hosted by KRS-One. Afterwards, Eyedea went on to tour as Atmosphere with Slug and other Rhymesayers crew. DJ Abilities was known for winning two DMC awards and for his work on his mixtapes and 1200 Hobos.  Musical career  Eyedea & Abilities made their jump from the battle scene with the release of their debut album First Born. Following a solo effort by Eyedea in 2002 under the name Oliver Hart, Eyedea and Abilities released E&A; in 2004, which returned Eyedea back to his battle rapper roots, with Vish Khanna from Exclaim! giving it a favorable review, saying: \\"Eyedea is a pesky braggadocio, spitting out disses like a mouthy schoolyard bully cracking his crew up at your expense.\\" Following E&A;, the duo went on an unannounced hiatus, bringing speculation that Eyedea & Abilities were no longer together. However, in August 2007, the duo announced via their MySpace that they would be at the Twin Cities Celebration of Hip Hop performing old songs, as well as new material. Eyedea & Abilities returned to the road in the Winter of 2007 with their 'Appetite For Distraction Tour'. Accompanied by fellow Minnesota artists Kristoff Krane and Sector7G, the tour was mainly on the west coast until the Spring of 2008 when the duo brought the 'Appetite For Distraction Tour' to listeners in east coast cities. The tour has garnered excitement from fans, as E&A; had taken a four- year hiatus, and the duo's next album was one of the most anticipated among the independent hip hop scene. The album By the Throat was released through Rhymesayers Entertainment on July 21, 2009. In 2007, Eyedea created a book of poetry and art with painter Louis N. LaPierre, who is also responsible for Face Candy's 'This Is Where We Were' album art. The book was titled 'Once A Queen... Always A Creep'. Only 80 copies were made. It was on sale during Eyedea & Abilities 'Appetite For Distraction' Tour. On October 16, 2010, Micheal Larsen's mother found him dead in his home as a result of an opiate toxicity.

The contributions of phenomenology in architecture are among the most significant and lasting in architecture, due to architecture's direct involvement with experience. Overview The phenomenology of architecture is the philosophical study of architecture. In contrast, architectural phenomenology is a movement within architecture beginning in the 1950s, reaching a wide audience in the late 1970s and 1980s, and continuing until today. Architectural phenomenology, with its emphasis on human experience, background, intention and historical reflection, interpretation and poetic and ethical considerations stood in sharp contrast to the anti-historicism of postwar modernism and the pastiche of postmodernism. It was never a movement proper because it did not have an immediate aesthetic associated with it, thus is should be understood as more of an orientation to thinking and making. Historical development American architects first started seriously studying phenomenology at Princeton University in the 1950s under Prof. Jean Labatut, whose student Charles W. Moore was the first to write a PhD dissertation, titled Water and Architecture (1958), that drew heavily on the philosophy of Gaston Bachelard. In Europe, Milanese architect Ernesto Nathan Rogers, through his influential editorship of the journal Casabella Continuit√† helped to advance architectural phenomenology in Europe.Jorge Otero-Pailos, Theorizing the Anti-Avant-Garde: Invocations of Phenomenology in Architectural Discourse, 1945-1989, (Ph.D. Dissertation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2001) He collaborated with philosopher Enzo Paci, and influenced a generation of young architects including Vittorio Gregotti and Aldo Rossi.Vittorio Gregotti and Jorge Otero-Pailos, \\"Interview with Vittorio Gregotti: The Role of Phenomenology in the Formation of the Italian Neo-Avant- Garde,\\" in Thresholds, n. 21 (Fall 2000), 40-46 By the 1970s, the Norwegian architect, theorist and historian Christian Norberg-Schulz achieved international acclaim with his book \\"Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture\\" (1979), which was markedly influenced by Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic ontology.Mark Jarzombek‚ÄîThe Psychologizing of Modernity (Cambridge University Press, 2000).He also wrote Intentions in Architecture (1963)For example, Martin Heidegger's essay \\"Building Dwelling Thinking\\", 1951 Christian Norberg-Schulz was, for many architecture students of the 1980s, an important reference in architectural phenomenology,A Norwegian, he graduated from the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich in 1949 and eventually became Dean of the Oslo School of Architecture. especially because the combination of texts and images in his books provided readily accessible explanations for how a phenomenological approach to architecture could be translated into designs. Norberg-Schulz spawned a wide following, including his successor at the Oslo School of Architecture, Thomas Thiis-Evensen.see Thomas Thiis-Evensen, Archetypes in Architecture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987) In the 1970s, the School of Comparative Studies at the University of Essex, under the direction of Dalibor Vesely and Joseph Rykwert, was the breeding ground for a generation of architectural phenomenologists, which included David Leatherbarrow, professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, Alberto P√©rez-G√≥mez, professor of architectural history and theory at McGill University, the architect Daniel Libeskind. In the 1980s, the phenomenological approach to architecture was continued and further developed by Vesely and his colleague Peter Carl in their research and teaching at the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge. As architectural phenomenology became established in academia, professors developed theory seminars that tried to expand the movement's range of ideas beyond Gaston Bachelard,Gaston Bachelard The Poetics of Space (1958) and Martin Heidegger, to include Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception (English version 1962) Hans-Georg Gadamer Hannah Arendt and an ever wider group of theorists whose modes of thinking bordered on phenomenology, such as Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson, Paul Virilio, Charles Taylor, Hubert Dreyfus and Edward S. Casey. The phenomenon of dwelling was one research theme in architectural phenomenology. Much of the way it was understood in architecture was shaped by the later thought of Martin Heidegger as set in his influential essay: \\"Building Dwelling Thinking.\\" He links dwelling to what he refers as the \\"gathering of the fourfold,\\" namely the regions of being as entailed by the phenomena of: \\"the saving of earth, the reception of sky (heavens), the initiation of mortals into their death, and the awaiting/remembering of divinities.\\" The essence of dwelling is not architectural, per se, in the same manner that the essence of technology for him is not technological per se\\"Building, Dwelling, Thinking\\" translated by Hofstadter, published in \\"poetry, Language, Thought\\", Harper Colophon Books, 1971.

Determination of the SRM value involves measuring the attenuation of light of a particular wavelength (430 nm) in passing through 1 cm of the beer, expressing the attenuation as an absorption and scaling the absorption by a constant (12.7 for SRM; 25 for EBC). The SRM (or EBC) number represents a single point in the absorption spectrum of beer. As such it cannot convey full color information which would require 81 points, but it does remarkably well in this regard (it conveys 92% of spectral information) even when fruit beers are considered. Auxiliary \\"deviation coefficients\\" (see Augmented SRM below) can pick up the remainder and are necessary for fruit beers and when subtle color differences in malt beers are to be characterized. Measurement method The ASBC and EBC measurements are now identical (both done at the same wavelength and in the same size cuvette) but the scaling is different. A photometer or spectrophotometer is used to measure the attenuation of deep blue (violet) light at 430 nm, as it passes through 1 cm of beer contained in a standard 1 cm by 1 cm cuvette. The absorption is the log of the ratio of the intensity of the light beam entering the sample to the intensity leaving. This difference is multiplied by 12.7 in the SRM system and 25 in the EBC (see below). For example, if the light intensity leaving is one one-hundredth the light intensity entering the ratio is 100, the absorption is 2 and the SRM is 25.4. The scale factor derives from the original definition of SRM discussed in the next paragraph. The SRM number was originally, and still is, defined by \\"Beer color intensity on a sample free of turbidity and having the spectral characteristics of an average beer is 10 times the absorbance of the beer measured in a 1/2-inch cell with monochromatic light at 430 nanometers.\\"[1] Modern spectrophotometers use 1 cm cuvettes rather than 1/2 inch ones. When a 1 cm cuvette is used, application of the Bouguer-Beer- Lambert law shows that the multiplier should be 12.7 rather than 10. When the SRM value for a beer or wort is larger than about 30 the log linear limit of some instruments using 1 cm cuvettes is approached. In such cases the sample is diluted with deionized water. Using Beer-Lambert again gives the mathematical definition of SRM in the general case as: :SRM=12.7\\\\times D \\\\times A_{430} where D is the dilution factor (D=1 for undiluted samples, D=2 for 1:1 dilution etc.) and A_{430} the absorbance at 430 nm in 1 cm. The 430-nanometer wavelength corresponds to a deep blue (violet) light, and was chosen, as was the multiplier, to make values determined in the SRM system comparable to those determined using the Lovibond system in use at the time the SRM was adopted.Irwin Stone, Miller, M.C. \\"The Standardization of Methods for the Determination of Color in Beer\\"ASBC Proceedings 1949 The SRM was adopted in 1950 by the American Society of Brewing Chemists which had recognized the need for an instrument based measurement of color unburdened by the difficulties of the Lovibond system which relies (it is still in use in many industries including brewing malts are often labeled with the Lovibond color of laboratory worts prepared from them) on visual comparison of the sample to tinted glass discs. Beer colors measured in SRM and degrees Lovibond were, as noted above, approximately equal at the time of adoption of the SRM. However, modern analytical methods show that SRM and Lovibond diverge for darker colors. Comparison of EBC and Lovibond data published by modern malsters shows that the relationship between SRM and Lovibond (¬∫L) is: :SRM = 1.3546 \\\\times {^\\\\circ L} - 0.76. EBC The EBC system of color measurement is similar to the SRM. Measurements are taken at 430 nm in a 1 cm cell but the unit of color is 25 times2.13.2 Spektralphotometrisch (EBC-Methode), Brautechnische Analysenmethoden Band II, MEBAK 2002 the dilution factor times A430 as opposed to 12.7 times the dilution factor times A430 so that :\\\\mbox{EBC} = \\\\mbox{SRM} \\\\times 1.97 :\\\\mbox{SRM} = \\\\mbox{EBC} \\\\times .508 Thus EBC is approximately twice SRM and this applies at any color depth. The agreement between SRM and Lovibond is fair for pale beers (10 ¬∞L ~ 12.7 SRM) but worsens for darker beers or worts (40 ¬∞L ~ 53.4 SRM). Both systems demand that the beer be free of turbidity prior to the measurement at 430 nm. In the SRM a second measurement is taken at 700 nm. If the absorption at this wavelength is less than 0.039 (this number comes from [2]) times the absorption at 430 nm the beer is considered turbidity free. If not, it is to be filtered or centrifuged and the reading repeated. If the ratio test is not passed after clarification then the beer does not have \\"average spectral characteristics\\" and, technically, is not qualified to be characterized by the SRM method. The augmented SRM method described below removes this difficulty. In the EBC system the beer is required to be filtered if its turbidity is more than 1 EBC turbidity unit (equivalent to 1 FTU). No absorption measurement is made other than at 430 nm. (the turbidimeter measures scattering at 650 nm). Note that an earlier version of EBC color was based on absorption at 530 nanometers, which permitted no direct conversion between the two systems. However, if one assumes a linear log absorption spectrum (the Linner hypothesis from the realm of caramel color), and knows the Linner Hue Index,R T Linner, \\"Caramel color: a new method of determining its color hue and tinctorial power.\\" Proceedings of the Society of Soft Drink Technologists Annual Meeting, 1970, p 63-72. H_L, the absorptions are related by: :A_{430} = A_{530} \\\\times 10^{H_{L}/10} A formula for converting between the old EBC color value and SRM sometimes continues to appear in literature. It should not be used, as it is flawed and based on measurements which are no longer taken. Part of the problem with this formula is that beer spectra are not log linear. The absorption of 1 cm of a beer with \\"average spectral characteristics\\" (average here means the average of the absorption spectra of the ensemble of 99 beers as described in[7]) at wavelength \\\\lambda is well described by :A(\\\\lambda) = {SRM\\\\over 12.7}(0.018747e^{-{(\\\\lambda - 430)\\\\over 13.374}} + 0.98226e^{-{(\\\\lambda - 430)\\\\over 80.514}}) While it is clear that one could use this formula to compute A530 from the SRM measured at 430 nm and thus interconvert between SRM and old EBC this is not where its value lies. Because it represents, at least approximately, the full absorption spectrum of the beer it can be used to calculate the tristimulus color (three color coordinates in a chosen color space which describes the color an observer actually sees) of a beer of known SRM by following the prescription of ASTM E-308.ASTM E-308-96 \\"Standard Practices for Computing the Colors of Objects by Using the CIE System\\", ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA 1996 Tristimulus color  There has been interest in tristimulus reporting in the brewing community in recent years and the ASBC has an approved Method of Analysis [MOA] for tristimulus characterization.\\"Beer 10-C Tristimulus Analysis\\", ASBC Methods of Analysis The absorption of the sample is measured in 1 cm at 81 wavelengths separated by 5 nm starting at 380 nm and extending to 780 nm. These are converted to transmission values (by taking the antilogarithm of each absorption) and inserting the results into ASTM E-308. The reported tristimulus values are in L*a*b* color space and describe what is seen under Illuminant C (daylight) by a 10¬∞ observer when the path is 1 cm. The choice of path, illuminant, observer and color space does not represent a limitation of E-308 but rather the ASBC's need to standardize reporting. If we are given only the SRM value for a beer we can compute the approximate transmission spectrum if the beer has average spectral characteristics simply by taking the antilog of A(\\\\lambda): :T(\\\\lambda) = log^{-1}(-{SRM\\\\over 12.7}(0.018747e^{-{(\\\\lambda - 430)\\\\over 13.374}} + 0.98226e^{-{(\\\\lambda - 430)\\\\over 80.514}})) This can be used with E-308 to calculate tristimulus color in any path, for any illuminant, for either observer in any colorspace derivable from CIE XYZ space. This formula could, for example, be used to compute color patches to be printed on transparency or card stock for use in evaluating the SRM of actual beers but color swatches prepared in this way are only valid for the illuminant, observer and path used in the E-308 calculation. The BJCP color guide was prepared in this way. This illustrates that the SRM does convey full color information if the beer has average spectral characteristics. If it does not then we need more information than just the SRM provides. Augmented SRM Recent researchA.J. deLange,\\"The Standard Reference Method of Beer Color Specification as the Basis for a New Method of Beer Color Reporting\\", J.Am.Soc. Brew. Chem 66(3) 143-150, 2008 has shown that the transmission spectrum of a beer (with no restriction on its spectral characteristics) can be represented by: T(\\\\lambda) = log^{-1}(-{SRM\\\\over 12.7}(0.018747e^{-{(\\\\lambda - 430)\\\\over 13.374}} + 0.98226e^{-{(\\\\lambda - 430)\\\\over 80.514}} +c_1 \\\\xi_1 + c_2 \\\\xi_2 + ...)) where the \\\\xi_i are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the normalized transmission spectra of the ensemble of beers from which the average normalized spectrum (the sum of the two exponential terms in parentheses in the A(\\\\lambda) formula) was determined and c_1, c_2 etc. are obtained as the dot products of the eigenvectors with the normalized transmission spectrum of the beer being characterized. This formula is identical to the one given previously with the exception that it has been augmented by the c_i coefficients which encode the deviation of the sample normalized spectrum from the average normalized spectrum. Where the sample beer has a normalized spectrum close to the average the c's are small and it is remarkable how often this is the case. Typically one or two augmentation coefficients are sufficient and they are frequently small enough that one or more can be neglected. For example, an imported ale with SRM equal to 6.8 has coefficients -0.07 and -0.1. Using both these coefficients one obtains color accuracy of less than one L*a*b* space unit (the limit of perception) in up to a 10 cm path under Illuminant C. Using just the SRM for this beer gives a reasonably good description of its color with error of about 4 L*a*b* units. Beers which deviate dramatically from the \\"average\\" spectrum are easily accommodated. Thus a sample of Kriek Lambic (Belgian cherry beer), has an SRM of 15.27. Were its color to be reconstructed from just the SRM it would be the color of an \\"average\\" beer which will be dark amber not the red of a Kriek. Including 3 coeffiecents (1.8, 0.8 and -0.1) yields color accuracy of less than 1 L*a*b* unit in paths up to 8 cm again under Illuminant C. Augmented SRM is advantageous relative to the ASBC tristimulus method in that color under any viewing circumstances can be computed in addition to which the familiar SRM rating is retained. Because of metamerism one cannot, in the general case of non zero deviation coefficients, estimate the original spectrum from the L*a*b* values reported by the ASBC method.

The events used the newly built Cesana Pariol track measuring 1435 metres with 19 curves, a vertical change of 114 metres, and an approximate top speed of 130 kilometres per hour. Competitions comprised four heats. Teams raced in the first and third heats in the order of the draw. The second heat was raced in order of ranking after the first heat, and the fourth heat is raced in order of the ranking after the first three heats. Total time for the four heats determined the final rank. Qualification The qualification was based on the results of pilots, with other members of a bobsleigh crew being selected by their National Olympic Committees. In the two man event, the top 22 pilots from the World Cup 2005-2006 season, the top four from the European Challenge Cup, and the top two from the North American Challenge Cup all qualified, subject to limits on number of crews per NOC. The four man event qualification was identical except that the World Cup season qualifies only 20 pilots. The two-woman event allowed the top 15 pilots from the World Cup 2005-2006 season. NOCs may not have selected other pilots than those who were within the qualifying limits, though if more than two pilots have qualified the selection was made by each individual NOC. The host nation is guaranteed at least one crew in each event. In addition, all five of the Olympic continents must be represented, with at least one crew in a men's event and one crew in the two woman event.

It was historically considered the third largest and most prominent town in the Tibet region (after Lhasa, and Shigatse), but there are now at least ten larger Tibetan cities.Dorje (1999), p. 254. Location The town is strategically located in the Nyang Chu valley on the ancient trade routes from the Chumbi Valley, Yatung and Sikkim, which met here. From Gyantse, routes led to Shigatse downstream and also over the Kora La (Pass) to Central Tibet.Dowman (1988), p. 269 The fortress (constructed in 1390)Vitali (1990), p. 30. guarded the southern approaches to the Yarlung Tsangpo Valley and Lhasa.Allen (2004), p. 30. The town was surrounded by a wall 3 km long.Buckley, Michael and Strauss, Robert (1986), p. 158.

Gyantse was the third largest city in Tibet before being overtaken by Qamdo. British military garrison Gyantse (labeled GYANGTSE) (1954) A British military garrison, consisting mainly of Indian soldiers, was stationed at Gyantse in the first half of the 20th century.

The Kumbum was commissioned by a Gyantse prince in 1427 and was an important centre of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. This religious structure contains 77 chapels in its six floors, and is illustrated with over 10,000 murals, many showing a strong Nepali influence, which have survived almost entirely intact. They are the last of its kind to be found in Tibet. Many of the restored clay statues are of less artistry than the destroyed originals - but they are still spectacular.Dowman (1988), p. 270.Mayhew (2005), p. 167.

After rioting in 1959, local industries were dismantled and artisans fled while others were placed in workcamps. Some 400 monks and laypeople were imprisoned in the monastery. During the Cultural Revolution, the fort, the monastery and Kumbum were ransacked. Precious objects were destroyed or sent out of Tibet. The chorten was spared. The main building of the Pelkor Chode or Palcho Monastery and the Kumbum have been largely restored but the dzong or fort is still largely in ruins. There is an \\"Anti-British Imperialism Museum\\" there which gives the PRC version of the 1904 British invasion.Mayhew (2005), p. 168. The sculpture that forms the centerpiece of the museum are two \\"Tibetan\\" warriors, but they were based on photos taken by Lt. G. J.

Although early maps show it as a lake surrounded by land, coastal erosion has made it an arm of the Gulf of Mexico. Its name comes from the French word borgne, which means \\"one-eyed.\\" Geography In southern Louisiana, three large lakes‚ÄîMaurepas, Pontchartrain, and Borgne‚Äîcover 55% of the Pontchartrain Basin. A brackish marsh land bridge and Lake St. Catherine separate Lake Pontchartrain from Lake Borgne. The Rigolets and Chef Menteur Pass are the two open water connections between Pontchartrain and Borgne. Lake Borgne [right center] is southeast of Lake Pontchartrain and east of New Orleans, Louisiana. Due to coastal erosion, Borgne is now a lagoon connecting to the Gulf of Mexico. Early 18th-century maps show Borgne as a true lake, largely separated from the Gulf by a considerable extent of wetlands that have since disappeared. In a 1902 case before the United States Supreme Court over the oyster banks at the boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi, the State of Mississippi argued that at the time of Louisiana's admission into the Union, there probably was no such \\"Lake Borgne\\" or \\"Mississippi Sound\\".Brief for Mississippi on her Demurrer to the Bill of Complaint. Supreme Court of the U.S. October term, 1902. No. 12 Original. State of Louisiana, complainant v State of Mississippi, defendant. Official Records. Miss. Dept. of Archives and History. Microfilm reel 3401. p.7. The basin contains 483,390 acres (1956 km¬≤) of wetlands, consisting of nearly 38,500 acres (156 km¬≤) of fresh marsh, 28,600 acres (116 km¬≤) of intermediate marsh, 116,800 acres (473 km¬≤) of brackish marsh, 83,900 acres (340 km¬≤) of saline marsh, and 215,600 acres (873 km¬≤) of cypress swamp. Since 1932, more than 66,000 acres (267 km¬≤) of marsh have converted to water in the Pontchartrain Basin‚Äîover 22% of the marsh that existed in 1932. The primary causes of wetland loss in the basin are the interrelated effects of human activities and the estuarine processes that began to predominate many hundreds of years ago. The Mississippi River delta was abandoned by natural changes in the river. In response to the extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed the 1.8-mile-long (2.9 km) IHNC Lake Borgne Surge Barrier, as part of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) for southeast Louisiana. The project cost approximately $1.1 billion and was built at the confluence of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO). It is the largest design-build civil works project in the history of the Corps. It was first used in 2012 to protect against storm surge from Hurricane Isaac, and was fully completed in 2013. Ecology de la Tour survey shows Lake Borne separated from the Gulf of Mexico by \\"Low and Marshy Meadows\\" (wetlands). The Mississippi River levees significantly limit the input of fresh water, sediment, and nutrients into the Pontchartrain basin. This reduction in freshwater input plays a role in the critical problem of the Pontchartrain Basin‚Äîincreased salinity. The construction of the Mississippi River‚ÄìGulf Outlet Canal (MRGO), which breaches the natural barrier of the Bayou La Loutre ridge and the Borgne land bridge, has allowed sea water to push farther into the basin. Relative sea level rise of up to 0.96 feet per century also gives saltier waters greater access to surrounding wetlands. As a result, mean monthly salinities have increased since the construction of the MRGO and other canals. In recent years, salinities have stabilized. The heightened salinity has stressed wetlands, especially freshwater marshes and swamps. Since 1932, approximately 24% of the Borgne Land Bridge has been lost to severe shoreline retreat and rapid tidal fluctuations, and the loss rate is increasing. During the same time, 17% of the Maurepas Land Bridge marshes disappeared due to subsidence and spikes in lake salinity. These land bridges prevent estuarine processes, such as increased salinity and tidal scour, from pushing further into the middle and upper basins. Additionally, from 1968 to 1988, 32% of the cypress swamp on the land bridge had either converted to marsh or became open water. If these buffers are not preserved, the land loss rates around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas will increase dramatically. Several marshes in the basin are vulnerable to rapid loss if adequate protection is not quickly provided.

It premiered on June 26, 2000 and ended on July 13, 2002. Spy Groove was created by Michael Gans, Richard Register and Kevin Thomsen, who also wrote and performed the voices for the show. The general plot is about two suave yet cocky secret agents, Agent Number One and Agent Number Two, and their boss, Helena Troy, who assigned them their missions. Like the tone of MTV's animated programs, Spy Groove is consistently tongue-in-cheek and often employs fast-paced banter between the protagonists. It also features a number of pop songs in some episodes at the time of its broadcast. Background and artistic style Co-creators Michael Gans and Richard Register were comedy duo performers before becoming writers and utilized their fast-paced rapport in the show based on their acts. The end credits sequence shows the protagonists (voiced by Gans and Register) chat and bicker together on topics irrelevant to the events of each episode, which was the only use of improvisation from the voice actors. The \\"Spy Groove\\" aesthetic is based on artist Glen Hanson's style, who designed the characters and settings. It is basic and shiny, with brilliant colours and dark lines. Because of Hanson's caricature work, many characters are modelled after celebrities including Agent Number One and Agent Number Two, who were modelled after Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, respectively. As a homage to classic cartoons, most of the animation is limited to lip- synching, facial expressions, some movements and action scenes, as characters are often still in most scenes of each episode.

However, keeping with the tone of the series the gadgets often contained various features, functions, and stylish trademarks that often ranged from convenient to the ridiculously useless (at least until the story-line made the item useful). Some examples include: *A pane of windshield glass that collapses down into a book of matches. *A corkscrew bottle-opener/thermo-coil/hummingbird feeder. *Digital, MP3 downloading divining rod (from the Sharper Image) *Cocktail drink coaster/two-way communicator with digital holographic projection capability. *Inflatable Life- sized Ricky Martin decoy. *\\"Dry-Spy\\" optional car modification. Converts a lime green convertible into a lime green submarine. Villains The majority of the Spy Groove villains are of the sort found in most secret agent fare. However very few were interested in global domination, but instead obsessed with some little slice of modern culture. For example, a plan to get all top 10 of the most eligible Hollywood bachelors (as defined by Blather magazine) married so that poor #11 would finally get noticed. Or to get every coffee drinker in the world addicted to the villains' own special blend. Some of the Spy Grove villains include: *Mr. Fish: a former hypnotist who did guest spots on the old Sonny and Cher Show, now obsessed with becoming the absolute creator of the fad of the week. He once tried to destroy Miami by causing a tidal wave, then donating some nearby swampland he had bought to the dispossessed citizens to make New Miami, and then using their gratitude towards him to let him hypnotize them with Bavarian Slap-dancing to a salsa beat. Once hypnotized the people of the international fad capital would adopt whatever fad he told them to, and thus... so would the world. *Rock Debris: a tacturn and irritable mercenary for hire for several of the Spy Groove villains. He specialized in blowing things up and looking cranky. He's memorable because he was probably the most often seen rogue in the gallery. *Sierra Nevada: daughter of a wealthy casino tycoon, and herself a robotics genius. She and Agent Number One are star-crossed lovers a la Batman and Catwoman as they both possess intellects that the other can respect. Her robots are often lifelike and are mistaken for the people they resemble. *The Marquis de Guy: the other Prince of Perve (wrestler Goldust being the first one), this Champagne Magnate has an affection for S and M and a few other letters best not considered. He schemed with Mimi Laverve to unleash genetically engineered butterflies to destroy the grape crops of the world's sparkling white wine giants so that whenever anyone toasts the new year, they must toast with him (or at least with his champagne).

It honors Leif Erikson (Old Norse: Leifr Eir√≠ksson, , ), the Norse explorer who led the first Europeans thought to have set foot in continental North America (other than Greenland). History The 1874 book America Not Discovered by Columbus by Norwegian-American Rasmus B. Anderson helped popularize the idea that Vikings were the first Europeans in the New World, an idea that was all but verified in 1960. During his appearance at the Norse-American Centennial at the Minnesota State Fair in 1925, President Calvin Coolidge gave recognition to Leif Erikson as the discoverer of America due to research by Norwegian- American scholars such as Knut Gjerset and Ludvig Hektoen. In 1929, Wisconsin became the first U.S. state to officially adopt Leif Erikson Day as a state holiday, thanks in large part to efforts by Rasmus Anderson. In 1931, Minnesota did also. Thanks to the efforts of the Leif Erikson Memorial Association of Saskatchewan, the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan proclaimed‚Äîthrough an order-in-council in 1936‚Äîthat Leif Ericsson Day would be observed on October 9. By 1956, Leif Erikson Day had been made an official observance in seven states (Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois, Colorado, Washington, and California) and one Canadian province (Saskatchewan). In 1963, Senator Hubert Humphrey and Representative John Blatnik, both from Minnesota, introduced bills to observe Leif Erikson Day nationwide. On September 2, 1964, Congress unanimously authorized and requested the President to create the observance through an annual proclamation. Full Text Lyndon B. Johnson did so that year, as has each president in the years since, often using the proclamation to praise the contributions of Americans of Nordic descent generally and the spirit of discovery. Bills have been introduced in the Parliament of Canada to observe Leif Erikson Day. Date October 9 is not associated with any particular event in Leif Erikson's life. The date was chosen because the ship Restauration coming from Stavanger, Norway, arrived in New York Harbor on October 9, 1825, beginning a wave of immigration from Norway to America. Observance The federal government of the United States observes the holiday and some U.S. states officially commemorate Leif Erikson Day. It is celebrated in many communities, particularly in the Upper Midwest and other places where large numbers of people from the Nordic countries settled. It has long been observed in Seattle, Washington. In 2012, the day was made official in Las Vegas, Nevada. Westby, Wisconsin and Norway, Michigan have held festivals near the day. There have been Canadian commemorations, including in Edmonton, Alberta and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The day is also celebrated in Iceland.

Creator of the Flower Fairies Flower Fairies are the product of English illustrator Cicely Mary Barker.http://www.flowerfairies.com Unable to go to school as a child because of her epilepsy, she was home-schooled and spent much of her time drawing and painting. Her artwork was influenced by illustrator Kate Greenaway and even more so by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and she developed her talent as a member of the Croydon Art Society. Her flower fairy paintings, in particular, were driven by the Victorian popularity of fairies and fairy stories. Cicely Mary Barker published her first Flower Fairies book in 1923; she received ¬£25 for Flower Fairies of the Spring, a collection of twenty-four paintings and illustrations. The books enjoyed huge popularity due to Queen Mary‚Äôs well- known interest in fairy art. She later published seven more volumes of Flower Fairies. Following the publication of Cicely Mary Barker's original Flower Fairy paintings and verses, two series of fairy stories featuring original Flower Fairies characters, Flower Fairies Friends and, more recently, Secret Stories, have also been published. The Flower Fairies were Cicely Mary Barker's most well-known creations. They are notable in particular because of the sweet, realistic depiction of the children, modelled on children enrolled in her sister Dorothy's kindergarten. She has also been likened to Beatrix Potter in the botanical accuracy of the plants and flowers amidst which the fairies dwell. The Flower Fairies and all related publications are licensed properties of Frederick Warne & Co and the Estate of Cicely Mary Barker. Original Flower Fairies books Below are the eight original Flower Fairies books and the dates they were published by Cicely Mary Barker's original publisher, Blackie. *Flower Fairies of the Spring (1923) *Flower Fairies of the Summer (1925) *Flower Fairies of the Autumn (1926) *A Flower Fairy Alphabet (1934) *Flower Fairies of the Trees (1940) *Flower Fairies of the Garden (1944) *Flower Fairies of the Wayside (1948) *Flower Fairies of the Winter (1985) Though first published in the first half of the century, Cicely Mary Barker's original eight volumes were re-launched in 2002 with slightly contemporary jackets, while maintaining their classic artwork. In addition, Frederick Warne & Co has published the following compilations of Cicely Mary Barker's Flower Fairy artwork and poetry. *The Complete Book of the Flower Fairies (1996) *Flower Fairies: The Meaning of Flowers (1996) *A Treasury of the Flower Fairies (1997) *Cicely Mary Barker and Her Art (1995) Flower Fairies today Frederick Warne & Co have published two other series of fairy stories based on Cicely Mary Barker's original characters and incorporating her original artwork. =Flower Fairies Friends= Flower Fairies Friends are books for younger readers, each telling the story of a particular fairy and her friends, and were first published in 2003. =Flower Fairies Secret Stories= Secret Stories is a new departure for the Flower Fairies.

It provides viewers with information on current and forecasted weather conditions for their respective area; a version of this segment is also available on the channel's national satellite feed that features forecasts for each region of the United States. The name \\"Local on the 8s\\" comes from the timing of the segment, as airs at timeslots that end in \\"8\\" (examples: 9:18 and 12:48); because of this manner of scheduling, the forecast segments air on the channel in ten-minute intervals. From 2006-2013, each forecast segment had usually been preceded by a promo for one of The Weather Channel's programs or services, leading into the segment with the announcer stating \\"And now, your Local on the 8s\\". On November 12, 2013 the promo segment was replaced by an intro that was built into the Local on the 8s segment. As of April 2018, the segments air in 30-minute intervals, usually at approximately :18 and :48 past each hour. History Of Local on the 8s The Weather Channel has carried a local weather forecast segment since the network was launched on May 2, 1982. The segments were originally seen either every five minutes or eight times an hour at various times (airing more frequently in the morning and less frequently at night). The structure of scheduling the segments six times an hour at times ending in \\"8\\" was implemented in mid-1995. The \\"Local on the 8s\\" name was first used on April 21, 1996 to coincide with a sweeping revamp of the channel's on-air presentation;USPTO filing (serial number 2183850) First Use in Commerce date The Weather Channel filed for a trademark on the name on June 24, 1997.USPTO filing (serial number 2183850) The name has caused confusion in the New York City market, as CBS Corporation's television and radio combination of WCBS-TV and WCBS (AM) use \\"traffic and weather on the 8s\\" to refer to the combined traffic and weather segments featured on those stations (which appear on WCBS-TV only during its morning newscasts and on WCBS radio at all hours). Forecasts are generated by a WeatherStar machine, a proprietary hardware system in the form of a computerized unit that is installed in a headend at the facilities of local pay television providers that carry the channel. Weather information is received from the vertical blanking interval of the TWC video feed and from data transmitted via satellite, which is then sent to the WeatherStar unit that inserts the localized data over the TWC feed. The WeatherStar systems are capable of adding or removing segments shown within the main local forecast segment, with the common exception of the extended forecast; these customized segments are referred to as \\"flavors,\\" which allow variabilities in the weather graphics displayed during each local forecast segment, resulting in certain types of specialized weather data appearing only at specific times or lengths. , the length of these flavors is uniformally one minute; flavor lengths previously varied between 30 seconds and two minutes prior to April 2013 and extended flavors of three to six minutes were previously included between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. Despite the name, the segment occasionally airs at times that do not end in \\"8\\" (such as 9:27, 9:57, 10:09, etc., usually no more than two minutes before the \\"8\\"s in an hour), particularly during original long-form programming and weekday morning forecast programs, such as AMHQ and the now-defunct Wake Up With Al. As of April 2018, the segment airs, regardless of programming, every 30 minutes ‚Äì at approximately :18 and :48 past each hour. Weather Star systems The majority of cable operators () use the IntelliStar, the sixth-generation and second-most recent STAR model, which was released in 2002. The IntelliStar platform can also generate graphics for Weatherscan, The Weather Channel's 24-hour localized weather network that is available on select cable and satellite systems. With an IntelliStar, in addition to current weather conditions for a given area, surrounding areas, and a specific region; 24- and 36-hour, daypart, and seven- day forecasts; and almanacs (products that are largely also available on older STAR systems that remain in use); cable viewers can also see air quality and health reports; specialized school day and activity forecasts; in coastal areas, tides and marine forecasts; and, in the past in certain large media markets, traffic conditions supplied by Traffic Pulse (which gathered the information in real time from intelligent transportation systems operated by state departments of transportation). The most recent STAR model, the IntelliStar 2, which was released in 2010 and is the seventh-generation model, generates weather data for The Weather Channel HD, the channel's high definition simulcast feed (the IntelliStar 2 is available in participating markets, with some cable and IPTV providers that use the SD-only IntelliStar system opting to transmit the national LDL/sidebar instead if the head-end does not have an IntelliStar 2 installed). Both the IntelliStar and IntelliStar 2 (and from 2000 to late 2000s/early 2010s even for the WeatherSTAR XL) have an audio feature, known as Vocal Local ‚Äì a function that assembles pre-recorded tracks for narration of the current temperature and sky conditions, descriptive forecasts and introductions to certain forecast products (the tracks are narrated by Allen Jackson and TWC meteorologist/storm tracker Jim Cantore for the respective systems). This function is similar to a narration feature in the WeatherSTAR 4000 that was used from 1990 to 1995; the narration, voiced by Dan Chandler, was used only to introduce products in the forecast segment. The IntelliSTAR 2 and the IntelliSTAR 2 Jr are the only STAR models that are currently in operation. Three other STAR systems were used sporadically until June 2014: the WeatherSTAR 4000 is the oldest (having first been introduced in 1989/1990) and was the first in the series to be capable of producing graphical local forecasts and radar images. The Weather Star Jr. is a budget model introduced in 1994 that was very uncommon from its introduction, and is similar to the now-discontinued WeatherSTAR III (known as WeatherSTAR 3000) in terms of products and appearance, although it uses the typeface of the 4000. The WeatherSTAR XL, introduced in the fall of 1998, is an IRIX-based machine, a major leap from the 4000 systems in terms of capabilities and graphic generation; it was used for Weatherscan until 2003 (the first use of the IntelliSTAR occurred that year on Weatherscan). All STAR systems are capable of generating a crawl, which runs a series of scrolling text advertisements that appear at the bottom of the screen during each forecast segment. As satellite television is broadcast to a large area, this localized weather model must be adapted for its viewers. The satellite forecast segment includes national weather headlines, daily forecasts and composite satellite/radar loops for the respective regions of the Northeastern, Southeastern, Central and Western United States. Until 2008, the satellite forecasts also featured four-day forecasts for 30 U.S. cities, regardless of region (similar to the former \\"Travel Cities Forecast\\" product used by STAR models from the WeatherStar 4000 and earlier). IntelliSTARs are installed at the primary uplink sites respectively used by DirecTV and Dish Network, but they run a different lower display line graphic and sidebar (the latter is seen only on the channel's HD feed) at all times even during commercial breaks. This cycles through current conditions (only denoting the sky condition, temperature, wind data and if applicable, apparent temperature) and daypart forecasts for major U.S. cities. The current time, based on time zone, and a news ticker displaying weather-related headlines appear above the LDL (while the IntelliSTAR models key the local time over the national LDL's time bar, the ticker, as with the segment rundown in the upper portion of the sidebar, is visible to all viewers). On November 8, 2006, Dish Network viewers began to be able to view local weather conditions and radar on The Weather Channel on DISH HOME Channel 100, based on their billing ZIP code, along with access to weather information in other cities. DirecTV viewers can receive local forecasts by ZIP code, which works through the \\"interactive\\" function of later receiver models (this function was temporarily suspended on January 14, 2014 due to the channel's carriage dispute with the satellite provider, and was restored when the channel was restored in April 2014 following the reach of a new carriage agreement). Although IPTV services are wired services (in a similar vein to cable television systems), allowing for the use of WeatherStar systems, AT&T; U-verse also does not provide localized forecasts through the aid of an IntelliStar computer (AT&T; U-verse does provide a dedicated Weather on Demand channel with forecasts provided by AccuWeather); as such, U-verse subscribers also see the satellite forecast segment during the \\"Local on the 8s\\" segments. During The Weather Channel's \\"Storm Alert\\" mode (which was introduced in 2005), specifically when a dangerous hurricane prepares to make landfall, the segment's :08 and :38 updates are dropped in favor of extended coverage. As of April 2018, the number of local forecasts seen each hour throughout the day, regardless of programming, has been reduced to two times ‚Äì at approximately :18 and :48 past each hour. =Lower Display Line (LDL) and sidebar= The Weather Star systems also utilize weather information in the form of a Lower Display Line (LDL); the LDL displayed by Weather Star systems from Weather Star Jr. and earlier were strictly text-based, and therefore contained no graphical background, and also only included current weather observations and monthly precipitation totals. The Weather Star XL included a semi-translucent background for the LDL and added local weather forecasts, while the IntelliStar system includes current conditions and forecasts for four (originally, three) nearby areas and until March 11, 2010, included air quality indexes, travel forecasts for three cities in the region, traffic information and almanac data. Time data was included on the LDLs as well as the full-screen local forecast graphics since the initial Weather Star system (this function was dropped on March 11, 2010 on the IntelliSTAR, though it returned to the LDL six days later on March 16) and the current date was also included on systems from Weather Star XL and earlier. With the addition of a national LDL during national programming on March 11, 2010, cable headends still using the Weather Star 4000 and Weather Star Jr. now overlay the text- only LDL over the national LDL due to the lack of a background on the 4000 and Jr.'s LDLs; the XL's LDL stopped receiving a signal to cue as well after this update. However, on extreme, rare conditions, the 4000 and/or Jr.'s LDLs will cue and remain on for a period during the day it gets cued. In recent years with the inclusion of original programming such as Storm Stories and Full Force Nature to The Weather Channel, the local forecasts began airing only for four times an hour during long-form entertainment-based programs and some forecast programming on the channel. Local weather information was provided during the other \\"8\\"s on the Lower Display Line during these programs. The standard \\"Local on the 8s\\" segment airs during non-forecast programming once every half-hour; until November 11, 2013, at about :18 and :48 minutes of each hour, an L-bar displaying localized weather observations and forecasts aired during a live national forecast update performed by one of the channel's on- camera meteorologists, running in a simultaneous picture-in-picture format. On November 12, 2013, The Weather Channel began to display the Lower Display Line full-time, throughout commercial breaks and telecasts of its long-form programs (prior to the change, commercials were broadcast full-screen and the LDL appeared during long-form programs on an intermittent basis). The graphical revamp resulted in other changes to the on-air display; the LDL was replaced on the \\"Local on the 8s\\" segments by a combined segment rundown/progress bar display, with time data being moved to an upper-third graphic. A sidebar was introduced, appearing on the right third of the screen (outside of the 4:3 safe area for standard definition viewers) on The Weather Channel HD, which unlike the LDL, is removed during commercial breaks and is only shown during the channel's forecast programming; the satellite version of the sidebar displays major airport delays, temperature and precipitation extremes for the current or previous day around the U.S., snowfall reports for major ski resorts (during the winter months only), as well as a rundown of the segments within the program (at the top of the screen) and weather information to be featured in the center portion of the sidebar (at the bottom-right corner, which is covered by the supplementary localized weather data on providers using the IntelliStar 2). For cable and IPTV subscribers, the IntelliStar 2 generates arrival and departure delays for area airports; visibility, dew point and barometric pressure data not included within the current observations featured on the LDL; almanac data (showing average and record minimum and maximum temperatures; sunrise and sunset, and in coastal areas, high and low tide times; and moon phase data for the current date); and air quality forecasts on the center of the sidebar. Music on Local on the 8s Pop and smooth jazz music is regularly played during the \\"Local on the 8s\\" segments; the music that is heard over the national feed's forecast segments is also transmitted over the localized segments generated by the STAR headend units. The Weather Channel released its own Smooth Jazz CD in 2007, The Weather Channel Presents: The Best of Smooth Jazz, based on collections of popular music played during the \\"Local On the 8s\\" segments. It peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top Contemporary Jazz charts that year. Artists included on this CD are Joyce Cooling, Dave Koz, Paprika Soul, Four 80 East, Jeff Lorber, Pieces of a Dream, Chick Corea, Jeanne Ricks, Ryan Farish, Mark Krurnowski, Najee and 3rd Force. In 2008, a second compilation CD containing the channel's most requested music was released, titled The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II. Artists on this CD include Russ Freeman & The Rippingtons, Jeff Lorber, Ramsey Lewis Trio, Bradley Joseph, Bernie Williams, David Benoit, Spyro Gyra, Norman Brown, Chris Geith, Joe Sample, Charlie Parker Quartet and Eric Marienthal. Other songs that can be heard during this segment include production music from the Network Music stock music service, and music from artists such as Trammell Starks (who composed 40 tracks specifically for The Weather Channel), The Rippingtons, Moby, EKO, Pat Metheny Group, Shadowfax, Roberto Tola, Chris Camozzi, Scott Ward, Miles Davis, Robert A. Wolf, David Becker and Kent Marcum. Instrumentals performed by bands such as The B-52's (\\"Follow Your Bliss\\"), Derek and the Dominos (the \\"Layla\\" piano exit), Devo (\\"Gut Feeling\\"), The Who (the beginning intro of \\"Eminence Front\\"), the Allman Brothers Band (\\"Jessica\\"), parts of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", \\"Terminal Frost\\" and Run Like Hell by Pink Floyd, and \\"Divided Sky\\" by Phish have also been heard during this segment. When Wake Up With Al premiered in July 2009, music from 3 Doors Down including \\"Here Without You\\" was added to the lineup, marking the first time the broadcast played music that contained lyrics. Most recently, much of the solo piano music was provided by new age pianist, Matthew C. Shuman, with his original pieces (\\"Chasing the Wind\\", \\"Stormy Sea\\", \\"Finding Freedom\\", \\"Frosty Sunrise\\", \\"Fallen Snow\\", \\"Falling Rain\\", \\"Night Storm\\", \\"Mixed Emotions\\", \\"White Water\\", \\"Running Out of Time\\", \\"Ocean Journey\\" and \\"Into the East\\").The Music of Matthew C. Shuman Official Website Other songs containing lyrics from artists such as Taylor Swift and Vanessa Carlton have been rotated into the local forecast cycle since then, though the inclusion of lyrical songs poses a problem as the ducking feature of the IntelliStar's Vocal Local function causes both the music and lyrics to be nearly muted (this is not the case with the IntelliStar 2) as the narration track is played in a nearly continuous manner until the end of the 24- to 48-hour forecast segment. This is in addition to the fact that the songs will not be played in their entirety due to the variable and often limited local forecast lengths. The Weather Channel suspends the music playlist regularly used during the forecast segments at other times (which is rotated on a seasonal basis) when a tropical storm or hurricane approaches coastal areas of the United States, during which time it is substituted with the \\"Storm Alert\\" music. During the holiday season, the normal music is replaced with appropriately-themed music such as instrumental versions of popular Christmas carols and music from A Charlie Brown Christmas is often played during the \\"Local on the 8s\\". Music and scores from various films including Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, Home Alone, Shaft, St. Elmo's Fire, and Tron: Legacy have also been played.The Weather Channel Music On July 7, 2009, into the early morning of July 8, The Weather Channel played the hit Michael Jackson song \\"Billie Jean\\", to commemorate the memorial service held in honor of Jackson that day in Los Angeles, two weeks after his June 25 death. It was also played during the Wake Up with Al playlists in the months that followed. Since November 12, 2013, the new music package introduced to The Weather Channel on that day also began to be played during the local forecasts, replacing the other music. Three songs from that package are being used for the local forecasts, with a fourth being used during the segments when the channel's \\"Red Alert\\" mode (which replaced the \\"Storm Alert\\" mode in 2012) is ongoing, which also suspends all music during very frequent weather situations. It also used vocal music from February to May 2014 along with the music package. In September 2014, a new song was added to the package; with seven more songs added in November 2014. The channel returned Christmas songs in December 2014. Smooth jazz music returned in 2016 on pre-determined days, usually four or five days per month. In September 2016, four new Storm Alert songs were added during coverage of Hurricane Hermine, replacing the one used since 2013. However, the original track returned during coverage of Hurricane Matthew and subsequent events (including Winter Storm Jupiter and the tornado outbreak of January 21‚Äì23, 2017) the following month. In March 2017, during coverage of Winter Storm Stella, another new storm alert theme was added. On July 4, 2017, and again on August 18, 2017, Weezer's newest song \\"Feels Like Summer\\" was played. On the day of the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, music containing the words \\"sun\\", \\"sunshine\\" or \\"eclipse\\" in the songs' title were played, including \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\", \\"Walking on the Sun\\", \\"Let the Sunshine In\\"; \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\" by Stevie Wonder, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" by the Beatles, and \\"Eclipse\\" by Pink Floyd. Three new songs from Extreme Music were added to the package in August 2018.

Biography Born in Hungary, as a child, Hetzron received both a general and religious Jewish education. He attended the University of Budapest, where he studied the Hungarian language and Hebrew as major subjects and started attending courses in the Department of Semitic Philology and Arabic. However, a few months later, he fled Budapest on a train following the 1956 Uprising in Hungary. He briefly stayed in Vienna and studied for a time in Strasbourg, before finally settling in Paris, where he studied linguistics with Andr√© Martinet and Joseph Tubiana. In 1960/61 he studied Finnish at Jyv√§skyl√§, Somali in London, and Italian at Perugia. He received his M.A. degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1961-1964 under the supervision of Hans Jakob Polotsky, and his Ph.D. at the University of California, Los Angeles, 1964-1966 under the supervision of Wolf Leslau. From 1966 and until his death he was professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Hetzron offered original ideas; first of all, about lingusitic subgrouping in diachrony. According to his explicit and theoretically grounded classification of Semitic, Arabic was grouped in Central rather than South Semitic. He demonstrated that in Ethiopian Semitic, the Gurage group is not genetically valid. His attempt to integrate the description of stress and intonation into syntax is unique (see his Hungarian publications). Selected publications =Hungarian Language= * Hetzron, R.

It replaced the Corona and Carina wagons, and was sold at Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations in Japan. While the Caldina has never been officially exported by Toyota, its All-Trac 4WD capability and large capacity have made it a popular grey import in Australia, New Zealand, Russia and many South American countries. When it was discontinued in 2007, the T270 series Avensis wagon/estate assumed its market position. According to Toyota, the name \\"Caldina\\" is inspired by the Italian (and English) adjective \\"cardinal\\", meaning \\"essential\\" or \\"fundamental\\". __TOC__  First generation (T190; 1992‚Äì2002)  The first generation Caldina is a 5-door wagon and commercial van version (1992‚Äì2002) of the Corona/Carina sedan in Japan. The wagon has independent strut rear suspension while the commercial wagon has semi- independent leaf springs.

The four-wheel drive models are coded ST215, and were also offered as Active Sports GT models with the 3S-GE engine. The top- of-the-line GT-T came with the turbocharged fourth generation 3S-GTE engine, and included a four-wheel drive system similar to the Celica GT-Four. The GT-T also came with optional electronic stability control (standard on Active Sports versions). The Aerial version features a large sunroof and contoured roof racks as standard. Weighing , the manual Caldina GT-T has a time of 6.4 seconds, with the automatic version only 0.1 seconds slower. A refresh was given in 2000 with new plastic bumpers and plastic headlights. The mostly- plastic interior was also updated. In 2001, an extra lug was added to the turbo manifold to prevent the manifold from warping which had been a common issue on GT-T models. Reliability of the GT-T engines proved to be a concern throughout the lifespan of the 3S powered GT-Ts, with spun main bearings and shattered oil pump gears being common issues amongst owners. Engines for lesser models are the 1.8 L 7A-FE petrol, the 2.0 L 3S-FE petrol and the 2.2 L 3C-TE diesel. Reliability and maintenance issues combined with relative obscurity, hampered perceived resale values of the GT-T in countries outside Japan, making the GT-T a very cheap people carrier in grey markets like Australia.

Engines for the Caldina are 1.8 L 1ZZ- FE, 2.0 L 1AZ-FSE and 2.0 L turbocharged 3S-GTE. Trim levels are 1.8 X, 1.8 Z, 2.0 Z, 2.0 ZT and GT-Four (the latter is coded ST246). All models have an automatic transmission and the GT-Four model only comes in a tiptronic transmission. As a tribute to Toyota's motorsports development guru and the creator of the first GT-Four, Hiromu Naruse, a special edition Caldina GT-Four was produced, the Caldina GT-Four \\"N\\" edition (N for Naruse). This model was equipped with several performance enhancements specified by Naruse: * Sports ABS * Improved shocks and altered spring ratings * Front upper strut bar * Torsen rear LSD * Recaro front seats and interior trim Production of the third generation Caldina ended in mid-2007 without a direct successor, but is indirectly replaced with the T270 series Avensis wagon/estate imported from UK.

Classification  Today's botanists consider the rhodora to be a distant relative of the other North American members of its genus, but the difference in floral structure did lead 19th century taxonomists to assign the plant its own genus Rhodora. Its closest relative is Rhododendron vaseyi from the Appalachian Mountains, which differs in having seven stamens. DNA sequencing shows that R. vaseyi is not related to R. canadense, but more to R. albrechtii.(Hans Eiberg)  Description  It reaches a mature height of 0.5‚Äì1.2 m (approximately 1‚Äì3 feet). In early spring, it produces pinkish- purple flowers in clusters of 2‚Äì6 together; each flower is 2‚Äì3 cm (approximately 1 inch) in diameter, with a five-lobed purple corolla. The flowers are unusual in comparison with other species of the genus Rhododendron found in northeastern North America. Most rhododendrons of the region have tubular flowers with 5 stamens each, while R. canadense has 10 stamens housed inside a zygomorphic corolla. The leaves open only after the flowers have bloomed and wilted; they are narrow oval, 2‚Äì6 cm long and 1‚Äì2 cm broad. When not in flower, it can still be identified by its peculiar, orange-brown seed cases, 1‚Äì1.2 cm long.  Distribution and habitat  The wild distribution of the rhodora begins at its easternmost extreme in Canada in Newfoundland and extends into eastern Ontario and the United States, where it has its most famous home in New England and also occurs naturally in New York, New Jersey, and at high altitudes in the Appalachian Mountains further south to Pennsylvania. It thrives in the moist, acidic soils of bogs, swamps, and clearings in woodlands.  Culture  For a long time, the species was regarded as a botanical icon of New England. The Transcendentalist writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, who spent his life in Concord, Massachusetts, paid homage to it in his poem \\"The Rhodora: On Being Asked Whence Is the Flower\\" (1834, pub. 1847). In this reflective lyric, the poet arrives at the epiphany that the beauty of the rhodora exists not only for its own sake but also discloses the mystical unity of all creation under God. The poet embraces this unity in his parting words to the rhodora: \\"The self-same Power that brought me there brought you\\". The composer Mary Lynn Lightfoot later set the poem to music in a song of the same name for a women's choir. Rhodora is also the name of the journal of the Harvard-affiliated New England Botanical Club, which is a peer reviewed scientific publication dedicated to the flora of North America.

Description Organisms in this class bear a tip at one end of their outer membrane. This apical complex includes vesicles called rhoptries and micronemes, which open at the anterior of the cell. These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells. The tip is surrounded by a band of microtubules, called the polar ring. As the name indicates, Aconoidasida (from Greek: negative prefix a- = \\"lacking\\") lack a conoid (they do have one only during the ookinete stage) in contrast to the class Conoidasida which have one throughout their life cycle.

This family was erected in 1903 by Mesnil and is one of the four families in the order Haemospororida.  Diagnostic criteria  The diagnostic criteria of the Plasmodiidae are: * Macrogametes and microgamonts develop independently * Meiosis is absent * Microgametocyte produces eight flagellated microgametes * Zygote is motile (known as an ookinete) * Conoid present in ookinete stage only * Sporozoites naked in oocyst (that is without a sporocyst) * Sporozoites have three walls * Heteroxenous: merogony and gamogony occur in vertebrate host, and fertilization and sporogony in definitive host (a blood-sucking insect) * Hemozoin pigment is produced Taxonomy The family Plasmodiidae has three sister taxa in the order Haemospororida: the families Garniidae, Haemoproteidae, and Leucocytozoidae. The Haemoproteidae and the Plasmodiidae both produce pigment, and these have been placed in the suborder Laveraniina. Neither the Haemoproteidae nor the Leucocytozoidae have an asexual cycle in the peripheral blood. The Garniidae do not produce pigment, but do have an asexual cycle in the blood.

As mobile phone use has grown since the mid-1990s, the significance of the devices in everyday life has grown accordingly. Owners of mobile phones can now use their devices to make calendar appointments, send and receive text messages (SMS), listen to music, watch videos, shoot videos, redeem coupons for purchases, view office documents, get driving instructions on a map, and so forth. The use of mobile content has grown accordingly. Camera phones not only present but produce media, for example photographs with a few million pixels, and can act as pocket video cameras.Nokia N93 datasheet www.nokia.com, 2006, retrieved 15 August 2006 Mobile content can also refer to text or multimedia hosted on websites, which may either be standard Internet pages, or else specific mobile pages.  Transmission  Mobile content via SMS is still the main technology for communication used to send mobile consumers messages, especially simple content such as ringtones and wallpapers. Because SMS is the main messaging technology used by young people, it is still the most effective way of reaching this target market. SMS is also ubiquitous, reaching a wider audience than any other technology available in the mobile space (MMS, bluetooth, mobile e-mail or WAP). More important than anything else, SMS is extremely easy to use, which makes adoption increase day by day. Although SMS is an old technology that may someday be replaced by the likes of Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) or WAP, SMS frequently gains new powers. One example is the introduction of applications whereby mobile tickets are sent to consumers via SMS, which contains a WAP-push that contains a link where a barcode is placed. This clearly substitutes MMS, which has a limited reach and still suffers from interoperability problems. It is important to keep enhancing the consumer confidence in using SMS for mobile content applications. This means, if a consumer has ordered a new wallpaper or ringtone, this has to work properly, in a speedy and reliable way. Therefore, it is important to choose the right SMS gateway provider in order to ensure quality-of-service along the whole path of the content SMS until reaching the consumer's mobile. Modern phones come with Bluetooth and Near field communication. This allows video to be sent from phone to phone over Bluetooth, which has the advantages that there is no data charge.Bluetooth video www.esato.com 5 August 2004, retrieved 15 August 2006 Content types = Apps = Mobile application development, also known as mobile apps, has become a significant mobile content market since the release of the first iPhone from Apple in 2007. Prior to the release of Apple's phone product, the market for mobile applications (outside of games) had been quite limited. The bundling of the iPhone with an app store, as well as the iPhone's unique design and user interface, helped bring a large surge in mobile application use. It also enabled additional competition from other players. For example, Google's Android platform for mobile content has further increased the amount of app content available to mobile phone subscribers. Some examples of mobile apps would be applications to manage travel schedules, buy movie tickets, preview video content, manage RSS news feeds, read digital version of popular newspapers, identify music, look at star constellations, view Wikipedia, and much more. Many television networks have their own app to promote and present their content. iTyphoon is an example of a mobile application used to provide information about typhoons in the Philippines. = Games = Mobile games are applications that allow people to play a game on a mobile handset. The main categories of mobile games include Puzzle/Strategy, Retro/Arcade, Action/Adventure, Card/Casino, Trivia/Word, Sports/Racing, given in approximate order of their popularity.\\"Puzzle/Strategy and Retro/Arcade Mobile Games Are the Most Popular Among U.K. 3G Subscribers, According to Telephia\\" Telephia, July 12, 2006, retrieved August 15, 2006 Several studies have shown that the majority of mobile games are bought and played by women. Sixty-five percent of mobile game revenue is driven by female wireless subscribers. They are the biggest driver of revenue for the Puzzle/Strategy category; comprising 72 percent of the total share of revenue, while men made up 28 percent (see Table 2). Women dominate revenue generation for all mobile game categories, with the exception of Action/Adventure mobile games, in which men drive 60 percent of the revenue for that category. It's also said that teens are three times as likely as those over twenty to play cell phone games. = Images = Mobile images are used as the wallpaper to a mobile phone, and are also available as screensavers. On some handsets, images can also be set to display when a particular person calls the users. Sites like adg.ms allow users to download free content, however service operators such as Telus Mobility blocks non Telus website downloads. = Music = Mobile music is any audio file that is played on a mobile phone. Mobile music is normally formatted as an AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) file or an MP3, and comes in several different formats. Monophonic ringtones were the earliest form of ringtone, and played one tone at a time. This was improved upon with polyphonic ringtones, which played several tones at the same time so a more convincing melody could be created. The next step was to play clips of actual songs, which were dubbed Realtones. These are preferred by record labels as this evolution of the ringtone has allowed them to gain a cut of lucurative ringtone market. In short Realtones generate royalties for record labels (the master recording owners) as well as publishers (the writers), however, when Monophonic or Polyphonic ringtones are sold only publishing or \\"mechanical\\" royalties are incurred as no master recording has been exploited.\\"Mobile Music Royalty Explained\\" MocoNews, June 22nd, 2005, retrieved August 15, 2006 Some companies promote covertones, which are ringtones that are recorded by cover bands to sound like a famous song. Recently Ringback tones have become available, which are played to the person calling the owner of the ringback tone. Voicetones are ringtones that play someone talking or shouting rather than music, and there are various of ringtones of natural and everyday sounds. Realtones are the most popular form of ringtones. As an example, they captures 76.4% of the US ringtone market in the second quarter of 2006, followed by monophonic and polyphonic ringtones at 12% and ringback tones and 11.5% - but monophonic and polyphonic ringtones are falling in popularity while ringback tones are growing.\\"Realtones Account for More Than 76 Percent of Mobile Consumer Spending on Music Personalization, According to Telephia\\" Telephia, August 7, 2006, retrieved August 15, 2006 This trend is common around the globe. A recent innovation is the singtone, whereby \\"the user‚Äôs voice is recorded singing to a popular music track and then ‚Äútuned-up‚Äù automatically to sound good. This can then be downloaded as a ringtone or sent to another user's mobile phone\\" said the director of Synchro Arts, the developers. As well as mobile music there are full track downloads, which are an entire song encoded to play on a mobile phone. These can be purchased and bought over the mobile network, but data charges can make this prohibitive.\\"Mobile Data Charges A Key Enabler of D2C Mobile Music\\" Research and Markets, July 2006, retrieved August 15, 2006 The other way to get a song onto a mobile phone is by \\"side loading\\" it, which normally involves downloading the song onto a computer and then transferring it to the mobile phone via Bluetooth, infra-red or cable connections. It is possible to use a full track as a ringtone. In recent years, websites have sprung that allow users to upload audio files and customize them into ringtones using specialized applications, including Myxer, MobilesRingtones, Bongotones, Ringtoneslab and Zedge. Mobile music is becoming an integral part of the music industry as a whole. In 2005, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI) said it expects mobile music to generate more revenues that online music before the end of that year.\\"Mobile downloads to overtake the net\\" by Cosima Marriner, Guardian Unlimited, August 3rd 2005, retrieved August 15th 2006 In the first half of 2005, the digital music market grew enough to offset the fall in the traditional music market - without including the sale of ringtones, which still makes up the majority of mobile music sales around the globe.\\"Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9%\\" IFPI, October 3rd, 2005, retrieved August 15th, 2006 = Video = Mobile video comes in several forms including 3GPP, MPEG-4, RTSP, and Flash Lite. = Mobishows and cellsodes = A Mobishow or a cellsode are terms to describe a broadcast quality programme / series which has been produced, directed, edited and encoded for the mobile phone. Mobishows and Cellsodes can range from short video clips such as betting advice or the latest celebrity gossip, through to half-hour drama serials. Examples include The Ashes and Mr Paparazzi Show which both were created for mobile viewing. Streaming = Radio = Mobile streaming radio is an application that streams on-demand audio channels or live radio stations to the mobile phone. In the U.S., mSpot was the first company to develop and commercialize streaming radio which went live in March 2005 on Sprint. Today, all major carriers offer some sort streaming radio service featuring programmed stations based on popular genres and live stations which included both music and talk. = TV = Mobile video also comes in the form of streaming TV over the mobile network, which must be a 2.5G or 3G network. This mimics a television station in that the user cannot elect to see what they wish but must watch whatever is on the channel at the time. There is also mobile broadcast TV, which operates like a traditional television station and broadcasts the content over a different spectrum. This frees up the mobile network to handle calls and other data usage, and because of the \\"one-to-many\\" nature of mobile broadcast TV the video quality is a lot better than that streamed over the mobile networks, which is a \\"one-to-one\\" system. The problem is that broadcast technologies don't have a natural up link, so for users to interact with the TV stream the service has to be closely integrated to the carriers mobile network. The main technologies for broadcast TV are DVB-H, Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), and MediaFLO. =Live video= Live video can also be streamed and shared from a cell phone through applications like Qik and InstaLively. The uploaded video can be shared to friends through emails or social networking sites. Most Live video streaming application works over the cell network or through Wi-Fi. They also require most users to have a dataplan from their cell phone carriers.  International trends  Since the late 1990s, mobile content has become an increasingly important market worldwide. The South Koreans are the world leaders in Mobile Content and 3-G mobile networks, then the Japanese, followed closely by the Europeans, are heavy users of their mobile phones and have been attaining custom mobile content for their devices for years. In fact, mobile phone use has begun to exceed the use of PCs in some countries. In the United States and Canada, mobile phone use and the accompanying use of mobile content has been slower to gain traction because of political issues and because open networks do not exist in America. On current trends, mobile phone content will play an increasing role in the lives of millions across the globe in the years ahead, as users will depend on their mobile phones to keep in touch not only with their friends but with world news, sports scores, the latest movies and music, and more. Mobile content is usually downloaded through WAP sites, but new methods are on the rise. In Italy, 800,000 people are registered users to Passa Parola, an application that allows users to browse a big database for mobile content and directly download it to their handsets. This tool can also be used to recommend content to others, or send content as a gift.Mobile Entertainment news article www.mobile-ent.biz, 2007, retrieved 19 September 2007 An increasing number of people are also beginning to use applications like Qik to upload and share their videos from their cell phone to the internet. Mobile phone software like Qik allows user to share their videos to their friends through emails, SMS, and even social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook. A 2016 Pew Research report \\"The Modem News Consumer\\" said 70 percent of those ages 18‚Äì29 preferred getting news from mobile devices rather than desktops, while the number was 53 percent for persons 30 to 49.

Zero The number 0 (Èõ∂, ) is the beginning of all things One The number 1 (‰∏Ä, ) is neither auspicious nor inauspicious. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. But it can also symbolize loneliness or being single. For example: November 11th is the Singles' Day in China, as the date has four ‚Äò1‚Äô which stand for singles. Two The number 2 (‰∫å or ÂÖ©, ) is most often considered a good number in Chinese culture. There is a Chinese saying: \\"good things come in pairs\\". It is common to repeat characters in product brand names, such as the character Âñú (), can be repeated to form the character Âõç (). In Cantonese, 2 (‰∫å or ÂÖ©, ) is homophone with the characters for \\"easy\\" (Êòì, ) and \\"bright\\" (‰∫Æ, ). * 24 () in Cantonese sounds like \\"easy die\\" (ÊòìÊ≠ª, ). * 28 () in Cantonese sounds like \\"easy prosper\\" (ÊòìÁôº, ). Three The number 3 (‰∏â, ) sounds like Áîü (), which means \\"to live\\" or \\"life\\" so it's considered a good number. It's significant since it is one of three important stages in a person‚Äôs life (birth, marriage, and death). On the other hand, number 3 (‰∏â,) sounds like Êï£ () which means \\"to split\\" or \\"to separate\\" or \\"to part ways\\" or \\"to break up with\\" so it's a bad number too. Four Numbers 4, 13 and 14 are omitted in some Chinese buildings. The number 4 (Âõõ, ) is considered an unlucky number in Chinese because it is nearly homophonous to the word \\"death\\" (Ê≠ª ). Thus, some buildings in East Asia omit floors and room numbers containing 4, similar to the Western practice of some buildings not having a 13th floor because 13 is considered unlucky. Where East Asian and Western cultures blend, such as in Hong Kong, it is possible in some buildings that the thirteenth floor along with all the floors with 4s to be omitted. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would in fact have just eighty one floors.

Most of these interludes range from ten seconds to a minute in length (with the exception of \\"vi. Drifting Patterns\\" which is over two and a half minutes long). The result length is 27 minutes. Critical response to the album was varied. A common criticism was that the album contained too many interludes. (In fact, there are more musical interludes on the album than there are songs.) Pitchfork Media, for instance, stated that many of these interludes were \\"annoying\\" . The psychedelic production of the album led critics to make comparisons to popular albums by The Beatles and The Beach Boys.

With a landmass of 531 square kilometres and a year-round population of 882 in the Canada 2016 Census, Kearney claims to be the \\"Biggest Little Town in Ontario.\\" History Kearney town centre Perry Township was opened to settlement in 1873 and the first two Post Offices in the township were established at Scotia and Emsdale, on the Muskoka Road. In 1879, in the north-east corner of the township, settlers Arthur J. O'Neil and his partner William Kearney opened a store on the 12th Concession, near what is now Cherry Hill Road, (west of Beaver Lake). In the following year a post office was opened in \\"Kearney Store\\" and inherited the name. In those days the closest railway was the Northern at Gravenhurst from which all supplies were brought up the Muskoka Road. Kearney prospered as a logging town with many sawmills and lumber camps. The logs were floated down the Magnetawan River, some as far as Byng Inlet. With the arrival of the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway in 1895, a siding was built at the foot of what was known as Long Lake (now Perry Lake). The commerce of the village shifted to the east side of the lake, near the railway station, where logs would be loaded onto the train after only a few days drive. In 1908, Kearney separated from the township of Perry, and it was incorporated as a town. The original parcel of land included 600 acres (2.4 km¬≤). The Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway was absorbed into the Canada Atlantic Railway, which was sold to the Grand Trunk Railway in 1905. In 1923 the Grand Trunk became part of the Canadian National Railways. The track from Kearney into Algonquin Park was abandoned in 1959. The rail bed was converted into a road to allow continued access to the now ghost towns of Ryan and Ravensworth, and Rain Lake in Algonquin Park. Sections of the original frontier roads around Ryan and Ravensworth now serve as snow-mobile trails, while others have been completely abandoned and allowed to grow wild. Through the 1970s Kearney claimed to be \\"The Smallest Town in Ontario.\\" On December 1, 1979, legislation was passed to amalgamate the town of Kearney, with the geographic townships of Proudfoot and Bethune, as well as the portions of Butt and McCraney townships in Nipissing District that were not part of Algonquin Provincial Park. In the mid 90s, a town councillor and Kearney Youth Group founder, Dale Louise Germaney, coined the name \\"Ontario's 'Biggest Little Town'\\" which is still used to this day. Community Kearney is a gateway to Algonquin Park wilderness with three access points - one at Tim Lake, one at Magnetawan Lake and most popular, at Rain Lake. Both canoe and hiking routes can be accessed from these park entry points. In the early years, the train took visitors right into the park, with many side trips available from there. Today the roads run right back into the park's three access points. Kearney is well known as a tourist centre, and has a seasonal population of over 2500 people. Kearney's popularity is not only because of its proximity to Algonquin Park, but for its swimming, water sports, camping and fishing. Lakes within the town boundaries, including Clam, Beaver, Fisher, Grass, Island, Loon and Sand Lakes, are vacation destinations for many visitors - boasting cottages, resorts, and campgrounds. Bear, moose and deer hunting provides sport for hunters coming to the area. The Kearney Community Centre, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2000, houses the municipal offices, library, and seniors room and banquet facilities. The centre offers indoor activities during the weekdays such as card parties and special interest classes. Kearney also has a number of groups including the Royal Canadian Legion, the Lions Club, and various church and other groups. =Events= Dog Sled Races on Main Street (Feb, 2006) Annual events include the Blackfly Festival, Lions Club Lobsterfest, Creative Changes Art Show, Sand Lake Regatta, Kearney Regatta, Kearney Lions Club Pancake Breakfast, Christmas Fun Fair and Craft Sale, the \\"Kearney Dog Sled Races\\", and Sand Lake Thanksgiving Sunday Turkey Shoot. Kearney is also well known for its grand and impressive firework show that is held every July. Visits can be made to the restored pioneer log church at Sand Lake as well as many other points of interest along the way. Kearney's history of logging also helped create the trails for their dog sled races in the winter. The races, which are organized by the Kearney Dog Sled Race Committee, have grown in popularity with both spectators and racers since its inception in 1995. The mushers can choose from a number of scenic trails used for four, six, and forty mile races, and as of February 2010, a 120-mile overnight race. In addition to the races, the weekend has a full roster of family events, including cross-country skiing and ice fishing. The local postal code of Kearney is P0A 1M0. The post office services the town with lock boxes and a rural route. Kearney is located 43 km north of Huntsville, Ontario. From Huntsville, follow Hwy 11 north until exit 244 (Emsdale), then Hwy 518 east to Kearney.

By 2022, the station will be open as part of the Big Ring Metro Line with name Stromynka (). History The northeastern end of the line, including Sokolniki, was built using the cut and cover method. The tunnels from Krasnoselskaya to Sokolniki were under construction as early as the summer of 1933, but work did not begin on the station itself until March 1934. The concrete shell of the station was completed in just five months, and Sokolniki opened along with the rest of the line on 15 May 1935. The first test run of the Metro took place in 1934 between Sokolniki and Komsomolskaya stations. Sokolniki was the eastern terminus of the line for 30 years until the 1965 extension to Preobrazhenskaya Ploshchad was completed. The reversal sidings are still used for maintenance and overnight storage of trains.

However, despite the advice of Ras Wolde Leul, one of Iyoas' senior counselors, envoys from Sennar convinced Badi to return to Sennar where he was quietly murdered after an imprisonment of two years.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 4 pp. 155f The Scots explorer James Bruce adds that Badi was killed by Welled Hassan, the governor of Atbara; because Welled Hassan had killed the king \\"with a lance, whereas the only lawful instrument was a sword\\", the governor was afterwards put to death.Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, selected and edited with an introduction by C.F.

Early life  Peter Nikolaevich Mamonov was born on 14 April 1951 to an engineer and a Norwegian translator. During his childhood, he lived on Bolshoi Karetny Lane. During his teens, he would dress as a stilyaga and often got into fights, one such incident resulting in a scar across his stomach (which can be seen in the film Igla, which he starred in over 20 years later). Mamonov's parents separated in the mid 1950s and his mother began a relationship with Nikolai Bortnichuk, also an engineer. This relationship resulted in the birth of Mamonov's half-brother, Aleksei Bortnichuk, on 13 July 1958. His first band were a covers band called Express, who were active in the mid-to-late 1960s and early 1970s, playing covers of popular rock bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, although Mamonov himself preferred black R&B;, soul and rock 'n roll music. During the 1970s, he suffered from depression and worked various jobs, including boiler operator and Norwegian translator (he learned the language from his mother). He lived with the artist Olga Gorokhova between 1979 and 1981. Gorokhova stated that Mamonov would listen to a lot of Weather Report during this period.  Zvuki Mu  In 1982, he began Zvuki Mu. The name originates from a series of affectionate names beginning with the syllable mu that Mamonov and Gorokhova would call each other, though the earliest occurrence of the name Zvuki Mu occurs in some of Mamonov's poetry from the late 1960s. Between 1986 and late 1987, he wore a moustache ‚Äì it can be seen in images of Mamonov from that period, such as the images inside the booklet of the compilation Mamonov '84‚Äì'87. Mamonov was one of the few rock musicians from former USSR who managed to achieve recognition abroad, through his collaboration with Brian Eno in the late 1980s. Around the same period he started acting in films, and over the next decade wrote, produced and acted in several one-man theatrical performances establishing himself as a cult figure in Russia. Zvuki Mu initially performed between 1982 and 1990, after which Mamonov started a new band called Mamonov and Aleksei with his half-brother Aleksei Bortnichuk. The new band performed music of a similar style to Zvuki Mu, using backing tracks instead of live drums, but in 1993-4, they acquired a live drummer and developed a new, back-to-basics hard rock sound, with Mamonov rewriting some older Zvuki Mu songs to fit in with this style. They released one album in 1992 and were recording a second one when Mamonov decided to rename the group to Zvuki Mu, resulting in the release of Zvuki Mu's Gruby zakat album in 1995.  Post-Zvuki Mu  In 1996, after disagreements between Mamonov and the other Zvuki Mu members, the band broke up again, with Zvuki Mu becoming just a pseudonym for Mamonov's solo work. He switched to using his own name for music in 2005, but in 2015, he formed a new band, Sovershenno novye Zvuki Mu (Brand New Zvuki Mu) with musicians from the indie band Stoneberry. In August 2019, Mamonov suffered a heart attack, necessitating the cancellation of his concerts for two and a half months while he had surgery.https://newinform.com/187139-akter-petr-mamonov-popal-s- infarktom-v-reanimaciyu  Acting career  One of Mamonov's best-known film appearances is in the leading role in Pavel Lungin's 1990 Taxi Blues. His theatre creations include Is There Life on Mars?, an absurdist take on Anton Chekhov's A Marriage Proposal, and Chocolate Pushkin, which makes a comical reference to (but doesn't cite) the Russian national poet Alexander Pushkin. Piotr explains the name for the album as his own comparison to a popular DJ who calls himself \\"Black Elvis\\" and also describes the genre on this record as \\"lit-hop\\" (literature hip-hop). In 2001 he appeared in a short but characteristic role in Serguei Loban's \\"Dust\\" () that was released only 4 years later and became a cult film. He returned to play the lead role in Pavel Lungin's religious film The Island (Russian: –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤), which closed the 2006 Venice Film Festival. His acting in the film was praised by Alexis II, Patriarch of Moscow, and won him a Best Actor Nika Award. In 2009 Pavel Lungin invited him again to appear in his new production entitled Tsar (Russian –¶–∞—Ä—å). Mamonov plays the title hero, tsar Ivan the Terrible, a character torn between passionate faith and cruelty.  Personal life  In 1995, he stated in an interview that he enjoyed listening to alternative rock, heavy metal and grunge, naming Nine Inch Nails, Jane's Addiction, the Butthole Surfers, White Zombie and Pantera as examples. In the 1990s, Mamonov converted to Orthodox Christianity, left the capital, and settled in a village.

It started out as a small theater called the Gem, which showed silent movies with a piano for music. It was later closed down and demolished, but rebuilt and expanded into the Iris Theater by owner Tony Duvall. After his retirement, the Iris changed hands several times before being renamed the Vista. The National Register of Historic Places, notes Iris Theater, Apartments and Commercial Building, built in 1930, is significant for its role in the urbanization of Murray City. With its combination of entertainment, retail, and residential space, the building represents an elaborate example of the multi-use commercial block common during the early twentieth-century development of the city's commercial business district. The building was owned by the Duvall family who managed the theater while living in the apartments above the storefronts. The Iris building is also significant as the only commercial building in Murray built in the Art Deco style. Though not a particularly ornate example of the style, the building makes a distinctive contribution to the State Street frontage of the Murray Downtown Historic District. The building is in good condition and is a contributing historic resource of the city.Brosschinsky, Karol; National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Nomination, 1999. Utah State Historic Preservation Office. The Iris was considered state-of-the-art at the time. The theater showed both blockbusters (e.g. \\"Gone with the Wind\\"), and more obscure fare (e.g. some Thursday nights were reserved for Swedish films shown especially for Swedish immigrants brought to Murray by the smelters). The theater had a stage where local groups could mount theatrical productions. The Iris Theater was a community place. Murray firemen sometimes held conventions there. Many of Murray's youths, including the Duvall children, worked in the theater. During the Great Depression, Tony Duvall would sometimes let children see a movie in exchange for scrap metal, or sometimes simply for free. Tony Duvall, with partner Joe Lawrence, later built the Murray Theater at 4961 South State. In the 1940s, the Iris would close during the summer while movies were shown in the larger (and cooler) Murray Theater. The theater first became Desert Star when Mike and Alyce Todd attempted to produce a play near This Is The Place Heritage Park. This play was the first to exhibit the common traits found today in Desert Star plays. After the summer ended, they attempted to find an indoor location for their plays. They considered the closed down Vista, and eventually took it and renamed it the Desert Star Playhouse. In 2000, after several successful plays, the city of Murray said that the building had to be brought up to code or torn down. The owner wanted to go with the latter, but the Todds decided to buy the theater and renovate. Today, the playhouse features Dinner and Cabaret theaters, as well as performing two shows in different theaters. Desert Star is known for parody plays, doing comedic spoofs of classic movies and stories. They are also known for political jokes, and their themes tend to revolve around Utah. Each show also ends with a musical olio, in which the performers dress up in various costumes and do musical numbers.

Johnson hides motionless behind some eucalyptus branches and waits for unsuspecting people to wander by. When they approach, he shakes the bush towards the unsuspecting tourists and startles them, sometimes making gruff \\"oogah-boogah\\" noises, while in-the-know observers giggle. Crowds gather to watch him work, often including those he has previously scared. The Bushman typically operates toward the western end of the Wharf (at Jefferson and Hyde Streets or thereabouts), well to the west of the Grotto. Johnson used to work with or, at different points in time, as a rival to a second Bushman, Gregory Jacobs, until the death of Jacobs in 2014. Crowds usually watch Johnson across the street from where he usually sits, to see him entertain people. In a \\"good year\\", Johnson claims to earn $60,000. However, he cited the same figure to one of his victims (after said victim chided him) in 1992. At one point, he employed a bodyguard to protect himself against attacks by the unamused, distract his targets, and to alert him to the approach of elderly people so he could avoid scaring them. The police have received a number of complaints about the Bushman, and Fisherman's Wharf merchants have tried to shut him down. In 2004, he was charged with four misdemeanors, but a jury cleared him. The District Attorney subsequently dropped several remaining public nuisance complaints. Although engaging in his street performance utilizing the bush as a prop, as of the mid 1990s, Johnson did not formally refer to himself as \\"The Bushman\\" until he was befriended by then Alameda residents John and daughter Alison Nowakowski, who would refer to him as such. Eventually, the name stuck and Johnson adopted the name as his formal street performing moniker. Two Bushmen While it is clear that from the 1990s until the death of Gregory Jacobs in 2014, two World Famous Bushmen operated on Fisherman's Wharf both as a team and as separate acts, sources differ as to whether Jacobs or Johnson was first to come up with the act. A 2009 article in SFSU's Xpress Magazine says: > Many people are unaware that there are, in fact, two Bushmen. When Gregory > Jacobs first came up with this gig, he recruited David Johnson, a man he met > at Fisherman's Wharf. As they worked together they developed a close > friendship. Johnson's deep voice scares those who unknowingly pass by the > man-made bush. Back then, Johnson would hold the bush and Jacobs would tell > the jokes, entertain those watching the action, and collect the tips. It has > been about fifteen years, and now they are complete enemies. Jacobs accuses > Johnson of running off with their money. Jacobs tries to avoid any conflicts > with Johnson by not working where and when he is.\\" However, the San Francisco Chronicle reports that Johnson was the original Bushman, joined by Jacobs in the 1990s. An article from 1999 suggests that Jacobs joined Johnson in a bodyguard role as well as to help with the act: \\"'I look after him,' says Gregory Jacobs, who recently joined the act as a full partner. 'I watch his back.' Greg Jacobs was featured in the video \\"Act (Diogenes)\\" by the artist Whitney Lynn. Jacobs is also the subject of a short film, The Bush Man. Gregory Jacobs died February 23, 2014 due to heart failure at the age of 60 years old, whilst Johnson remains active.

It is one of several species of Plasmodium parasites that infect humans including Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax which are responsible for most malarial infection. It is rare compared to these two parasites, and substantially less dangerous than P. falciparum. P. ovale has recently been shown by genetic methods to consist of two subspecies, P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. History This species was first described in 1914 by Stephens in a blood sample taken in the autumn of 1913 from a patient in the sanitarium of Pachmari in central India and sent by Major W. H. Kenrick to Stephens (who was working in Liverpool). Epidemiology P. ovale is primarily concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and islands in the western Pacific. However P. ovale has also been reported in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, as well as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam In several studies, the reported prevalence of P. ovale was low relative to other malaria parasites, with fewer than 5% of malaria cases being associated with P. ovale infection. Higher prevalences of P. ovale are possible under certain conditions, as at least one study in Cameroon found the prevalence of P. ovale infection to be greater than 10%. It has been estimated that there are about 15 million cases of infection each year with this parasite. While similar to P. vivax, P. ovale is able to infect individuals who are negative for the Duffy blood group, which is the case for many residents of sub Saharan Africa. This explains the greater prevalence of P. ovale (rather than P. vivax) in most of Africa. Clinical features In humans, symptoms generally appear 12 to 20 days after the parasite has entered the blood. In the blood, the parasite's replication cycle lasts approximately 49 hours, causing tertian fever which spikes approximately every 49 hours as newly replicated parasites erupt out of red blood cells. Mean maximum parasite levels have been found to be 6,944/microl for sporozoite-induced infections and 7,310/microl for trophozoite-induced infections. In some cases, relapse may occur up to 4 years after infection. =Diagnosis= The microscopic appearance of P. ovale is very similar to that of P. vivax and if there are only a small number of parasites seen, it may be impossible to distinguish the two species on morphological grounds alone. There is no difference between the medical treatment of P. ovale and P. vivax, and therefore some laboratory diagnoses report \\"P. vivax/ovale\\", which is perfectly acceptable as treatment for the two are very similar. Sch√ºffner's dots are seen on the surface of the parasitised red blood cell, but these are larger and darker than in P. vivax and are sometimes called James' dots or James' stippling. About twenty percent of the parasitised cells are oval in shape (hence the species name) and some of the oval cells also have fimbriated edges (the so-called \\"comet cell\\"). The mature schizonts of P. ovale never have more than twelve nuclei within them and this is the only reliable way of distinguishing between the two species. P. vivax and P. ovale that has been sitting in EDTA for more than half-an-hour before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to P. malariae, which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives. Molecular tests (tests that look for DNA material from P. ovale in blood) must take into account the fact that there are two subspecies of ovale and tests designed for one subspecies may not necessarily detect the other. =Treatment= Standard treatment is concurrent treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. The combination atovaquone-proguanil may be used in those patients who are unable to take chloroquine for whatever reason. An overdose on Chloroquine can be very dangerous and can result in death. Phylogenetics Among the species infecting the great apes, Plasmodium schwetzi morphologically appears to be the closest relation to P.ovale. this had not been confirmed by DNA studies. The original species has been shown to be two morphologically identical forms ‚Äì Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri ‚Äì which can be differentiated only by genetic means. Both species have been identified in Ghana, Myanmar, Nigeria, S√£o Tom√©, Sierra Leone and Uganda. The separation of the lineages is estimated to have occurred between 1.0 and 3.5 million years ago in hominid hosts. A second analysis suggests that these species separated (95% confidence interval 0.5 ‚Äì 7.7 Mya). A third worked sequenced the whole genome of both species, confirmed the differences and dated the split at around million years. Although dating is always difficult, the authors date that split to be 5 times older than the P. falciparum and P. reichenowi split. These species appear to be more closely related to Plasmodium malariae than to Plasmodium vivax. The two species appear to differ in their biology with P. ovale wallikeri having a shorter latency period than P. ovale curtisi. Life cycle P. ovale is introduced into the human host by the bite of an infected mosquito, in a motile form called a sporozoite. The sporozoites are carried by the blood to the liver, where they replicate asexually by merogony into non-motile merozoites. Several hundred merozoites are produced and released into the blood stream where they infect erythrocytes. Inside the erythrocyte, the parasite's replication cycle takes approximately 49 hours, after which the erythrocyte ruptures and between 8 and 20 merozoites are released to infect other erythrocytes. Some of these merozoites will instead form gametocytes which remain in the blood and are ingested by a mosquito. When gametocytes are ingested by a mosquito, the gametocytes enter the mosquito gut where fertilisation occurs forming a zygote known as an ookinete. The ookinete moves to the outer wall of the mosquito midgut where it develops over the course of several weeks. This developing stage is called an oocyst. After the oocyst develops, it ruptures releasing several hundred sporozoites. The sporozoites are carried by the mosquito's circulation to the mosquito salivary glands. When the mosquito feeds again, the sporozoites enter through the salivary duct and are injected into a new host, starting the life cycle again. There are situations where some of the sporozoites do not immediately start to grow and divide after entering the hepatocyte, but remain in a dormant, hypnozoite stage for weeks or months. The duration of latency is variable from one hypnozoite to another and the factors that will eventually trigger growth are not known; this explains how a single infection can be responsible for a series of waves of parasitaemia or \\"relapses\\". Hosts While humans appear to be the natural mammalian host of P. ovale, chimpanzees and Saimiri monkeys have also been experimentally infected. Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus are likely the natural mosquito hosts of P. ovale. Experimentally, several other mosquito species have been shown to be capable of transmitting P. ovale to humans, including: *Anopheles albimanus *Anopheles atroparvus *Anopheles dirus *Anopheles farauti *Anopheles freeborni *Anopheles maculatus *Anopheles quadrimaculatus *Anopheles stephensi *Anopheles subpictus  Genomes  The full genomes of the two P. ovale species can be seen on geneDB.org ‚Äì P. ovali curtisi P. ovale wallikeri and plasmoDB.org, published 2017.

It was first published in 1959 in the United Kingdom as The Minnipins and in the United States as The Gammage Cup. It was later republished by Scholastic in November 1991 and by Harcourt in 2000. It tells the story of a race of little people called the Minnipins who, despite inner divisions, must unite to defend their village and the valley in which they live against an evil race of humanoid creatures called the Mushrooms or Hairless Ones. The sequel, The Whisper of Glocken, was published in 1965. Themes in the book include conformity and individualism. The book also includes several references to the real world including the poem Mary Had a Little Lamb and several common abbreviations such as ltd., co., bros., etc. It was highly praised and became a Newbery Honor book and an ALA Notable Children's Book. Audiobook and cartoon versions of the book were also created. Background and publication history Caroll Kendall became interested in writing for children when her first novel The Black Seven was published in 1946. She enjoyed writing about children and eventually decided to write children's stories. Of her first forays into fantasy writing she says, \\"I thought I didn't know enough to write fantasy, and then suddenly I had a theme to work on and gradually the characters became real\\". Kendall's main character Muggles was inspired by a friend who often joked about being in a muddle. an article in Child Life inspired her to write about the dangers of conformity. She said: > It was about a costume party, and went something like this: 'Everybody' was > having costume birthday parties that yearit was the very latest fad and the > mothers met in protest to plan an end to their children's obsessive copy- > catism. When the day of the party finally came and the children began to > arrive at the birthday house, they found that their secret costumes were > exactly like all the other secret costumes.

Summary Map of the Land Between the Mountains by Erik Blegvad. =Setting= The story starts in a fictional valley named the Land Between the Mountains. It is surrounded by four mountain ranges: Snowdrift to the north, Frostbite to the south, the Sunrise Mountains to the east and the Sunset Mountains to the west. This valley is populated by twelve villages of Minnipins, a race of industrious \\"little people\\" rather like hobbits.Carol Kendall Biography and Book Review from School Library Journal \\"Carol Kendall.\\" St. James Guide to Young Adult Writers. Gale, 1999. Gale Biography In Context. Web. 11 July 2013. The novel takes place in a village called Slipper-on-the- Water, in and around the gold mines in the Sunset Mountains and on a nearby knoll where the outlaws live. The date of the story is given as the year of Gammage =Plot= Slipper-on-the-Water is home to a clan known as the Periods, who are descendants of Fooley the Magnificent or the Great Fooley, who 440 years before the book opens constructed a balloon, flew to the land beyond the mountains and returned with a case of curiosities. They hold high offices in Slipper-on-the-Water, have very high opinions of themselves and have a \\"Council of Periods\\" that rules the village. Also living in the village are a group of Minnipins referred to as \\"Them\\" by the other villagers. These include Gummy, Walter the Earl and Curley Green. \\"Them\\" shun the tradition- based existence of the other Minnipins. One night, a Minnipin named Muggles wakes up and sees fires in the Sunset Mountains in the West. While digging for treasure, Walter the Earl discovers a vault under his house and finds iron chests that contain ancient scrolls, swords, armor and military trumpets. The scrolls reveal that Fooley the Magnificent's story and contain ominous warnings from Walter the Earl's forebear Walter the Obtuse saying that the vault will be found when it is needed for the protection of the Minnipins. The mayor returns from the annual meeting of village mayors with news that there will be a contest to find the finest village in the Land Between the Mountains. The winning village will win the legendary and sacred Gammage Cup. The villagers are excited but the Periods convince the villagers that \\"Them\\" will ruin their chances of winning the cup. During a town meeting, the Periods outlaw \\"Them\\". Mingy, the curmudgeonly money-keeper who resists spending money for \\"fancying up the village\\" is also outlawed. Along with Muggles who has become involved with \\"Them\\" because of her seeing the fires on the Sunset Mountains. The \\"Outlaws\\" paddle up the river to Gummy's stone cabin on The Knoll. They move in but the cabin is too small for all of them and decide to sleep outside until a new house is built. Muggles organizes their working efforts and after much progress is made, they explore the Old Mines in the Sunset Mountains. Walter the Earl brings an iron sword from the vault. Inside the mines the sword glows as a warning, and they hear tapping sounds. After this phenomenon occurs again, they assume that the legendary enemies of the Minnipins known as The Mushrooms have returned and are preparing to attack, and they hold a council of war. Muggles decides that Mingy should reconnoiter the Old Mines while the rest of the \\"Outlaws\\" wait behind. In the mines, Mingy sees several hairless creatures with mushroom-colored skin round bellies and big ears and wearing tight, brownish-white clothes. Over 200 of them emerge from the mines. Mingy concludes that these must be the Mushrooms and tries to return to the others, but his is foot is trapped in the rocks. The rest of the Outlaws rush to save Mingy as the Mushrooms swarm to capture him. They chase most of the Mushrooms away but four of them capture Mingy and carry him into the mountain. Gummy chases them into the Old Mines and returns after he is hit by a poisonous spear. The group return to Gummy's cabin to tend to his worsening wound. Curly Green and Muggles stay and defend Gummy while Walter the Earl returns to Slipper-on-the-Water to raise an army to fight the Mushrooms. Walter the Earl tries to tell the Periods mayor and council about the coming Mushroom army but they will not listen. He decides to raise the village without the help of the Periods. He is successful, but the Periods tell the villagers the Walter is deranged and the villagers are uncertain what to do. An eerie chanting is heard from the mountains. In the Old Mines, the Mushroom chief refuses to kill Mingy. One of the Mushrooms is scratched by a poison spear and Mingy watches as a white substance is used on the scratch, and thinks this may help his foot. After the Mushrooms leave to fight, he puts some on his foot, which feels better. The Mushroom army attacks the cabin where Gummy, Curly Green and Muggles are hiding. Gummy becomes weak because of the poison from the spear and Curly Green is knocked out while Muggles wards off the Mushrooms. The Minnipin army attacks and a fierce battle ensues. As the Mushrooms flee back into the Old Mines, Mingy sets a heap of mats on fire, making it impossible for the Mushrooms to escape. They rush out to escape the flames and are defeated by the Minnipin army. Mingy emerges from the cave holding the pot of white substance which is used cure Gummy and the injured Minnipins soldiers. The Period village council regrets expelling the Outlaws and no longer cares about winning the Gammage Cup. The villagers celebrate the return of the soldiers and the five Outlaws. The three judges of the contest arrive. Witnessing the happy scene, they decide that Slipper-on-the-Water is the most deserving village and leave the Gammage Cup in the town square.

A reviewer from the Black Gate said the book is \\"a warning against 1950's conformist tendencies\\". Another theme used in the book is uniting against a common foe. Although the Periods and the outcasts are initially in opposition to one another, they are forced to reconcile their differences when they are all threatened by the Mushrooms. The theme of individualism are prevalent throughout the book. When Muggles is invited to return to the village by Ltd., she tells him she is no longer \\"poor simple Muggles\\" (184) and has gained individuality in her life at the knoll.

However, when it comes to battle, the Mushrooms are treated like non-humans or animals‚Äîalien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises no questions of conscience. The Minnipins feel no pity for their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from the Mushrooms as they are killed.

It is one of several species of Plasmodium parasites that infect other organisms as pathogens, also including Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, responsible for most malarial infection. Found worldwide, it causes a so- called \\"benign malaria\\", not nearly as dangerous as that produced by P. falciparum or P. vivax. The signs include fevers that recur at approximately three-day intervals ‚Äì a quartan fever or quartan malaria ‚Äì longer than the two-day (tertian) intervals of the other malarial parasites. History Malaria has been recognized since the Greek and Roman civilizations over 2,000 years ago, with different patterns of fever described by the early Greeks. In 1880, Alphonse Laveran discovered that the causative agent of malaria is a parasite. Detailed work of Golgi in 1886 demonstrated that in some patients there was a relationship between the 72-hour life cycle of the parasite and the chill and fever patterns in the patient. The same observation was found for parasites with 48-hour cycles. Golgi concluded that there must be more than one species of malaria parasite responsible for these different patterns of infection. Epidemiology Each year, approximately 500 million people will be infected with malaria worldwide Of those infected, roughly two million will die from the disease. Malaria is caused by six Plasmodium species: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale curtisi, Plasmodium ovale wallikeri, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi. At any one time, an estimated 300 million people are said to be infected with at least one of these Plasmodium species and so there is a great need for the development of effective treatments for decreasing the yearly mortality and morbidity rates. Geographical areas of malaria transmission P. malariae is the one of the least studied of the six species that infect humans, in part because of its low prevalence and milder clinical manifestations compared to the other species. It is widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, much of southeast Asia, Indonesia, on many of the islands of the western Pacific and in areas of the Amazon Basin of South America. In endemic regions, prevalence ranges from less than 4% to more than 20%, but there is evidence that P. malariae infections are vastly underreported. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has an application that allows people to view specific parts of the world and how they are affected by Plasmodium vivax, and other types of the Plasmodium parasite. It can be found at the following link: http://cdc.gov/malaria/map/index.html. Role in disease P. malariae can infect several species of mosquito and can cause malaria in humans. P. malariae can be maintained at very low infection rates among a sparse and mobile population because unlike the other Plasmodium parasites, it can remain in a human host for an extended period of time and still remain infectious to mosquitoes. =Vector= The vector of transmission of the parasite is the female Anopheles mosquito, but many different species have been shown to transmit the parasite at least experimentally. Collins and Jeffrey report over thirty different types of species, which vary by geographic region. =Incubation period= Information about the prepatent period, or the period of time between the infection of the parasite and demonstration of that parasite within the body, of P. malariae associated malaria is limited, but the data suggests that there is great variation, often the length of time depending on the strain of P. malariae parasite. Usually, the prepatent period ranges from 16 to 59 days. =Infection in humans= Plasmodium malariae causes a chronic infection that in some cases can last a lifetime. The P. malariae parasite has several differences between it and the other Plasmodium parasites, one being that maximum parasite counts are usually low compared to those in patients infected with P. falciparum or P. vivax. The reason for this can be accounted for by the lower number of merozoites produced per erythrocytic cycle, the longer 72-hour developmental cycle (compared to the 48-hour cycle of P. vivax and P. falciparum), the preference for development in older erythrocytes and the resulting earlier development of immunity by the human host. Another defining feature of P. malariae is that the fever manifestations of the parasite are more moderate relative to those of P. falciparum and P. vivax and fevers show quartan periodicity. Along with bouts of fever and more general clinical symptoms such as chills and nausea, the presence of edema and the nephrotic syndrome has been documented with some P. malariae infections. It has been suggested that immune complexes may cause structural glomerular damage and that renal disease may also occur. Although P. malariae alone has a low morbidity rate, it does contribute to the total morbidity caused by all Plasmodium species, as manifested in the incidences of anemia, low birth rate and reduced resistance to other infections. Due to a similarity in the appearances of the pathogens, P. knowlesi infections are often misdiagnosed as P. malariae infections. Molecular analysis is usually required for an accurate diagnosis. =Diagnostics= The preferable method for diagnosis of P. malariae is through the examination of peripheral blood films stained with Giemsa stain. PCR techniques are also commonly used for diagnoses confirmation as well as to separate mixed Plasmodium infections. Even with these techniques, however, it may still be impossible to differentiate infections, as is the case in areas of South America where humans and monkeys coexist and P. malariae and P. brasilianum are not easily distinguishable. Biology As a protist, the plasmodium is a eukaryote of the phylum Apicomplexa. Unusual characteristics of this organism in comparison to general eukaryotes include the rhoptry, micronemes, and polar rings near the apical end. The plasmodium is known best for the infection it causes, malaria. =Life cycle= Plasmodium malariae wiki P. malariae is the only human malaria parasite that causes fevers that recur at approximately three- day intervals (therefore occurring every fourth day, a quartan fever), longer than the two-day (tertian) intervals of the other malarial parasites. =Human infection= Liver stage In this stage, many thousands of merozoites are produced in each schizont. As the merozoites are released, they invade erythrocytes and initiate the erythrocytic cycle, where the parasite digests hemoglobin to obtain amino acids for protein synthesis. The total length of the intraerythrocytic development, is roughly 72 hours for P. malariae. At the schizont stage, after schizogonic division, there are roughly 6-8 parasite cells in the erythrocyte. Following the erythrocytic cycle, which lasts for seventy two hours on average, six to fourteen merozoites are released to reinvade other erythrocytes. Finally, some of the merozoites develop into either micro- or macrogametocytes. The two types of gametocytes are taken into the mosquito during feeding and the cycle is repeated. There are no animal reservoirs for P. malariae. Mosquito stage Similar to the other human- infecting Plasmodium parasites, Plasmodium malariae has distinct developmental cycles in the Anopheles mosquito and in the human host. The mosquito serves as the definitive host and the human host is the intermediate. When the Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected individual, gametocytes are ingested from the infected person. A process known as exflagellation of the microgametocyte soon ensues and up to eight mobile microgametes are formed. Sexual stage Following fertilization of the macrogamete, a mobile ookinete is formed, which penetrates the peritropic membrane surrounding the blood meal and travels to the outer wall of the mid-gut of the mosquito. The oocyst then develops under the basal membrane and after a period of two to three weeks a variable amount of sporozoites are produced within each oocyst. The number of sporozoites that are produced varies with temperature and can range from anywhere between many hundreds to a few thousand. Eventually, the oocyst ruptures and the sporozoites are released into the hemocoel of the mosquito. The sporozoites are then carried by the circulation of the hemolymph to the salivary glands, where they become concentrated in the acinal cells. A small number of sporozoites are introduced into the salivary duct and injected into the venules of the bitten human. This initiates the cycle in the human liver. =Morphology= The ring stages that are formed by the invasion of merozoites released by rupturing liver stage schizonts are the first stages that appear in the blood. The ring stages grow slowly but soon fill one-fourth to one-third of the parasitized cell. Pigment increases rapidly and the half- grown parasite may have from 30 to 50 jet-black granules. The parasite changes various shapes as it grows and stretches across the host cell to form the band form. Laboratory considerations P. vivax and P. ovale sitting in EDTA for more than 30 minutes before the blood film is made will look very similar in appearance to P. malariae, which is an important reason to warn the laboratory immediately when the blood sample is drawn so they can process the sample as soon as it arrives. Microscopically, the parasitised red blood cell (erythrocyte) is never enlarged and may even appear smaller than that of normal red blood cells. The cytoplasm is not decolorized and no dots are visible on the cell surface. The food vacuole is small and the parasite is compact. Cells seldom host more than one parasite. Band forms, where the parasite forms a thick band across the width of the infected cell, are characteristic of this species (and some would say is diagnostic). Large grains of malarial pigment are often seen in these parasites: more so than any other Plasmodium species, 8 merozoites. Management and therapy Failure to detect some P. malariae infections has led to modifications of the species- specific primers and to efforts towards the development of real-time PCR assays. The development of such an assay has included the use of generic primers that target a highly conserved region of the 18S rRNA genes of the four human-infecting species of Plasmodium. This assay was found to be highly specific and sensitive. Although serologic tests are not specific enough for diagnostic purposes, they can be used as basic epidemiologic tools. The immunofluorescent-antibody (IFA) technique can be used to measure the presence of antibodies to P. malariae.. A pattern has emerged in which an infection of short duration causes a rapidly declining immune response, but upon re- infection or recrudescence, the IFA level rises significantly and remains present for many months or years. The increasing need to correctly identify P. malariae infection is underscored by its possible anti-malarial resistance. In a study by M√ºller-St√∂ver et al., the researchers presented three patients who were found to be infected with the parasite after taking anti-malarial medications. Given the slower pre-erythrocytic development and longer incubation period compared to the other malaria causing Plasmodium species, the researchers hypothesized that the anti-malarials may not be effective enough against the pre-erythrocytic stages of P. malariae. They thought that further development of P. malariae can occur when plasma concentrations of the anti-malarials gradually decrease after the anti-malarial medications are taken. According to Dr. William E. Collins from the Center of Disease Control (CDC), chloroquine is most commonly used for treatment and no evidence of resistance to this drug has been found.Collins, William. \\"RE: Current research on Plasmodium malariae.\\" Email to Chibuzo Eke. 18 February 2009. In that event, it is possible that the results from M√ºller-St√∂ver et al. provided isolated incidences. Public health, prevention strategies and vaccines The food vacuole is the specialized compartment that degrades hemoglobin during the asexual erythrocytic stage of the parasite. It is implied that effective drug treatments can be developed by targeting the proteolytic enzymes of the food vacuole. In a paper published in 1997, Westling et al. focused their attention on the aspartic endopeptidase class of enzymes, simply called plasmepsins. They sought to characterize the specificity for the enzymes cloned from P. vivax and P. malariae. Using substrate specificity studies and inhibitor analysis, it was found that the plasmepsins for P. malariae and P. vivax showed less specificity than that for P. falciparum. Unfortunately, this means that the development of a selective inhibitor for P. malariae may prove more challenging than the development of one for P. falciparum. Another study by Bruce et al. presented evidence that there may be regular genetic exchange within P. malariae populations. Six polymorphic genetic markers from P. malariae were isolated and analyzed in 70 samples of naturally acquired P. malariae infections from different parts of the world. The data showed a high level of multi-genotypic carriage in humans. Both of these experiments illustrate that development of vaccine options will prove challenging, if not impossible. Dr. William Collins doubts that anyone is currently looking for possible vaccines for P. malariae and given the complexity of the parasite it can be inferred why. He states that very few studies are conducted with this parasite, perhaps as a result of its perceived low morbidity and prevalence. Collins cites the great restrictions of studies with chimpanzees and monkeys as a sizeable barrier. Since the Plasmodium brasilianium parasite that infects South American monkeys is thought to be an adapted form of P. malariae, more research with P. brasilianium may hold valuable insight into P. malariae. The continuing work with the plasmepsin associated with P. malariae, plasmepsin 4, by Professor Ben Dunn and his research team from the University of Florida may provide hope for long term malaria control in the near future.Dunn, Ben.\\"RE:Current research on Plasmodium malariae.\\" Email to Chibuzo Eke. 18 February 2009.

It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Namangan Region. Namangan is located in the northern edge of the Fergana Valley, less than 30 km from the Kyrgyzstan border. The city is served by Namangan Airport. Namangan has been an important craft and trade center in the Fergana Valley since the 17th century. Many factories were built in the city during Soviet times. During World War II, industrial production in Namangan increased fivefold compared with that of 1926‚Äì1927. Currently, Namangan is mainly a center for light industry, especially in food. The officially registered population of the city was 475,700 in 2014. Uzbeks are the largest ethnic group.  History  The city takes its name from the local salt mines (in Persian ŸÜŸÖ⁄©‚Äå⁄©ÿßŸÜ (namak kan) ‚Äî \\"a salt mine\\"). Babur mentioned the village of Namangan in his memoirs Baburnama. In his book A brief History of the Khanate of Kokand () (Kazan, 1886), the Russian ethnographer Vladimir Petrovich Nalivkin wrote that Namangan is mentioned in legal documents dating back to 1643. Namangan, like many other cities in the Fergana valley, was originally populated by Sogdian people, although it later became a Persian speaking city; the local variety of Persian became known as the Tajik language. An influx of Turkic-speaking people into the region, starting in late medieval times, led to turkification. While Namangan still had a Tajik majority until the middle of the 19th century, identification of its residents with Turkic rather than Iranian cultures has increased. By the late 20th century, most residents of Namangan speak Uzbek, albeit with a significant Tajik-speaking minority. Politically, Namangan became a part of the Uyghur Empire of the Karakhanid State and was known to have been a settlement in the 15th century. The residents of the ancient city of Akhsikat, which was severely damaged by an earthquake, moved to the then- village of Namangan in 1610. Namangan became a city afterward. On the eve of the Russian invasion in 1867, the town had been a part of the Khanate of Kokand since the middle of the 18th century. Namangan was hit by a destructive earthquake in 1926 which killed 34 people, injured 72, and destroyed 4,850 houses. Since Uzbekistan's independence in 1991, Namangan has gained a reputation for Islamic revivalism, with many mosques and schools funded by organizations from Middle Eastern countries, including the extremist Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia that produced jihadist terrorists like Juma Namangani who fought and died in support of the Afghan Taliban and the Al Qaeda. This has also translated into political opposition against the secular government of Uzbekistan. Some women have discarded traditional colorful scarves for large white veils or even the black paranja.  Geography  Namangan is located above sea level. The Qoradaryo and Naryn Rivers join together to form the Syr Darya just outside the southern edge of the city. By road Namangan is east of Tashkent, west of Andijan, and east of Chust. = Climate = Namangan has a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: BSk) with cold winters and hot summers. The average July temperature is . The mean temperature in January is .  Demographics  Namangan is Uzbekistan's third- largest city by population. The population of Namangan was 475,700 in 2014. Uzbeks and Tajiks are the largest ethnic groups.  Economy  Namangan has been an important craft and trade center in the Fergana Valley since the 17th century. After annexation by the Russians in 1867, cotton production and food processing became the dominant economic activity, as it did in many other places in the country. Many factories were built in the city during Soviet times. During World War II, industrial production in Namangan increased fivefold compared with that of 1926‚Äì1927. After the war both light and heavy industries increased significantly. Currently Namangan is mainly a center for light industry, especially in food. There are 36 joint companies and over 400 small and medium enterprises in the city.  Education  There are three higher education institutions in Namangan city ‚Äî Namangan State University, Namangan Engineering Pedagogical Institute, and Namangan Engineering Technological Institute. Namangan State University is the largest, oldest and highest ranked of the three. The city is also home to ten colleges, two vocational schools, four academic lyceums (the best one is Lola academic lyceum under Namangan State University), and 51 general education schools.  Landmarks  The Mulla Kyrgyz Madrasa () was built in 1912 by a local cotton magnate. The Mosque of Ota Valikhan Tura (), built in 1918, is one of the largest in Central Asia, now home to a local branch of the Wahabi sect. Olmos city is counted among the landmarks of Namangan city. The Namangan Natural History Museum houses local archaeological finds. The Hadja Amin Kabri Architectural Complex () has an ornate terra-cotta fa√ßade dating from the 18th or 19th century. About west of Namangan are the Akhsikat ruins, a 1st-century settlement on the Syr-Darya River. The former capital of the Fergana Valley was destroyed by the Mongols and rebuilt by the Timurids. It was abandoned in 1620 after an earthquake.  Transportation  Namangan is served by Namangan Airport which is located 12 km from the city center. The city is also served by a railway station which was built in 1912. Trolleybuses and buses operated in Namangan from 1973 until 2010. They have largely been replaced by public vans (known in Russian as marshrutkas).  Notable people  *Mashrab (1640‚Äì1711) ‚Äî an influential Sufi poet. Boborahim Mashrab was born in 1657. He went to Qashqar and increased his knowledge under supervision of Ofoq Hoja. From 1673 up to the end of his life he lived as a travelling mystic.

Landini, Giancarlo Olivero, Maria Maddalena, detta Magda, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani (2017). Olivero performed widely and increasingly successfully until 1941, when she married and retired from the stage, only taking part thereafter in sporadic charity events. Not having had children as she would have liked to, however, she resumed her career ten years later, at the request of Francesco Cilea, who asked her to sing again the title role in his opera Adriana Lecouvreur.Rosenthal, H. and Warrack, J., \\"Olivero, Magda\\", The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1979, pp. 358‚Äì359; Hastings, Stephen, \\"Magnificent Obsession: Why Magda Olivero Adriana Lecouvreur\\", Opera News, Vol. 58, No. 13, March 1994.

She had already made her second debut on 20 January as Mim√¨, at the same Teatro Grande. From 1951 until her final retirement, Olivero appeared in opera houses throughout Italy and, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, all around the world (Europe, Egypt, U.S., Latin America), but never in such premier venues as the Royal Opera House or the Paris Opera. Olivero performed just once at the Vienna State Opera, and exceedingly rarely at La Scala.Cf Royal Opera House Collections Online, Les Archives du Spectacle , Wiener Staatsoper Archives (in German), and Archivio La Scala. Throughout the second part of her career she appeared at La Scala only 20 times overall, in just three productions. Among her most renowned interpretations were those of the leading roles in Adriana Lecouvreur, Iris, Fedora, Tosca, La Boh√®me, La Fanciulla del West, La Traviata, La Wally, Madama Butterfly, Manon Lescaut, Mefistofele, Turandot (as Li√π) and La Voix Humaine, the Italian version of which she premiered in Trieste in 1968.

The role of Medea, belonging to an eighteenth-century repertoire that was quite alien to her ordinary interests, was again taken at the Music Hall Theater in Kansas City in 1968, as well as, three years later, at Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, in concert, and eventually at Mantua's Teatro Sociale.Quattrocchi, Vincenzo, Magda Olivero: Una voce per tre generazioni, Turin, Italgrafica, 1984, p. 113.

There exist only two studio recordings of complete operas featuring Olivero: Turandot (as Li√π, with Gina Cigna, for Cetra Records, 1938) and Fedora (with Mario Del Monaco and Tito Gobbi, conducted by Lamberto Gardelli, for Decca, 1969). There exists a film, too, drawn from a 1960 RAI-television broadcast of Tosca. Studio recordings of individual pieces are also rare. Between 1939 and 1953 Olivero was called upon by Cetra to record arias by Puccini, Cilea, Boito, Verdi and others,ArkivMusic. including the finale of Act 1 of La Traviata, which Rodolfo Celletti described as \\"the most fascinating performance of this scene and aria ever committed to the phonograph.\\"Moritz, Charles (editor-in-chief), Current Biography Yearbook 1980, Volume 41, New York, H. W. Wilson Company, 1981, p. 295. In 1964 Celletti had written Olivero's version was \\"almost certainly the most heart-felt and quivering rendition of this aria ever given on record\\" (Le grandi voci, Rome, Istituto per la Collaborazione Culturale, 1964, p. 589). Apart from these pieces, there are only two other official records: a sacred music recital entitled Quando il Canto Diventa Preghiera, performed at the Angelicum Theatre in Milan (Ariston Records, no longer available at present), and the highlights from Francesca da Rimini (with Del Monaco, conducted by Nicola Rescigno, for Decca, 1969). In 1993, when her stage career had been over for many years, Olivero recorded, with piano accompaniment, Adriana Lecouvreur (with Marta Moretto as the Princesse de Bouillon): excerpts from this recording were published on the Bongiovanni label. At age 86, she performed Adriana's monologue in Jan Schmidt-Garre's film Opera Fanatic. In spite of the scanty interest shown by the official record industry, live recordings exist of many of her performances that are fully able to document her great artistic skills. The extent of Olivero's ability was identified by her great admirer Marilyn Horne, who, in 1975, firmly insisted that the Met should at last engage Olivero: \\"she practically gave acting and singing lessons while onstage; honestly, you could learn more from watching an Olivero performance than from reading most books on those very subjects.\\"Horne, Marilyn and Scovell, Jane, Marilyn Horne: The Song Continues, Fort Worth, Baskerville, 2004, p. 184. On the occasion of her death, sympathetic obituaries appeared in the press around the world. In his TheaterJones article musician and critic Gregory Sullivan Isaacs reported the following opinion expressed by Emmanuel Villaume, the Dallas Opera's music director, as \\"one of the best summaries\\" of Olivero's artistry: > Magda Olivero was a unique artist. People generally praise her mostly for > her dramatic stage presence. What always impressed me in her interpretations > was the ability, beyond her stagecraft, to use her God given natural voice > and unsurpassed technique, as well as superior and cultured musicianship, to > put all these components at the service of a controlled and unified > performance. > Drama, magic and music just fed each other perfectly.Magda Olivero, > 1910-2014, \\"TheaterJones\\", 15 September 2014.

Biography Carol Kendall was born in Bucyrus, Ohio, and was a graduate of Ohio University. Some of her first books were directed at adults such as \\"The Black Seven\\" (1946) and \\"The Baby Snatcher\\" (1952). It was her travels across the world that inspired her folk tale stories.

She was survived by two daughters and three grandchildren. Writing career Commenting on her career Kendall once said: :People ask me \\"What made you decide to be a writer?\\" and laugh knowingly when I answer \\"Six older brothers.\\" Those six brothers were as fine a set of boys and young men as one could want, but they did talk a lot. By the time I made my belated appearance into the family, they were so well gifted in the flow of conversation that there were few pauses for the addition of one small female voice. So I grew up listening. Family recollections would indicate that I was just one sentence short of being completely mute‚Äîmy single comment of record (at age four) was \\"Thank goodness that noisy thing is gone.\\" The noisy thing was my brother Arden, whose goings and comings were as turbulent as a high wind gusting through the house. But then came school! I loved school. The teachers also talked a lot, but they did it to me instead of to each other, and their words were about reading and writing‚Äîworth all the missed conversations in the world. My voice could be heard at last! Before the year was out, I started to write a \\"diary-book\\" with my new power. The opening line was \\"I saw my first robin today.\\" It was also the last line, for clearly I had run out of words I knew how to write. The rest of my thoughts would have to wait a spell. I am still not adept at entering conversations when there are more than three competing talkers, but I don't mind much because I know I can put my own offerings into the computer and fish them out when the time is ripe.

The citizens are being forced off their land to make way for a new super highway. Faced with saying goodbye to their friends and their way of life, the boys rally the townspeople to fight back against the rich and powerful Indians.  Plot  The boys and their parents go to an Indian casino on a Native American reservation. Kyle's father ends up losing his house betting on blackjack, due to him having a gambling problem. The entire town is bought out by the Native Americans, who plan to tear it down so that they can build a superhighway connecting their casino to Denver. The inhabitants are forced to leave their homes unless they can come up with $300,000 by the next day. The boys meet with some of the other children in town to come up with an idea. An unfamiliar new boy named Alex points out that they have to save the town. The boys advise their parents to get all the money they have, and then go bet it at the casino. If they win a round of roulette, they would have enough money to buy back the town, plus $50,000. They miraculously win, but as expected from avid gamblers, bet all their winnings again (on the hopes of winning $12,250,000) and lose. When they are selling their homes, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny try to get them to stand up for the town, as does Alex. Initially the adults say they will move to Middle Park instead, to which the boys say \\"...until the Native Americans come to take Middle Park too.\\" While the adults remain naive, the four main characters run outside and stand in front of the Native Americans' bulldozers, blocking their path. The townspeople soon join the boys, whilst singing \\"Love Is a Battlefield\\" by Pat Benatar. The casino's owner, Chief Runs With Premise, plots another way to get rid of the townspeople. The Chief decides to give blankets to the townspeople as a peace offering, after infecting the blankets with SARS (mirroring the events of the siege of Fort Pitt). The whole town gets sick, except for Stan, and Stan's father tells Stan he must cure SARS, or \\"only 98%\\" of the town would be left. At the same time, however, the casino owner's son, Premise Running Thin, gets infected with SARS accidentally because he had shared a drink with one of the Chinese men, and none of the Native Americans' herbs are able to cure him. The owner decides to take out his anger on the townspeople with Operation Shock and awe. Stan goes to a wise old man in a trailer in another town, who gives him an \\"inward journey\\" brought on by sniffing paint thinner. He discovers the trailer-living white man's way to cure the illness is Campbell's chicken noodle soup, DayQuil, and Sprite, and hands the mixture to the people of South Park, who all recover. The casino chief arrives and is shocked to find the people are healthy and not half-dead. He begs them for the cure to SARS for his son, offering them a $5 coupon. The chief's wife gives him a disapproving look and a nudge, so he instead gives the titles back to the South Park residents. Alex notes the lesson that South Park is more than just a town, but a community of people that cannot easily be split up.

He was born and raised in Mexico City. While he took art classes at the Academy of San Carlos, his photography is self-taught. His career spanned from the late 1920s to the 1990s with its artistic peak between the 1920s and 1950s. His hallmark as a photographer was to capture images of the ordinary but in ironic or Surrealistic ways. His early work was based on European influences, but he was soon influenced by the Mexican muralism movement and the general cultural and political push at the time to redefine Mexican identity. He rejected the picturesque, employing elements to avoid stereotyping. He had numerous exhibitions of his work, worked in the Mexican cinema and established Fondo Editorial de la Pl√°stica Mexicana publishing house. He won numerous awards for his work, mostly after 1970. His work was recognized by the UNESCO Memory of the World registry in 2017.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the- world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage- page-1/the-archives-of-negatives-publications-and-documents-of-manuel-alvarez- bravo/ accessed 7 Feb 2020 Life √Ålvarez Bravo was born in Mexico City on February 4, 1902. His father was a teacher but pursued painting, photography and writing, producing several plays and his grandfather was a professional portrait maker. Because of this, Alvarez Bravo had early exposure to the medium. He grew up in the historic center of Mexico City behind the Cathedral, in one of the many former colonial buildings converted into apartments for the city's middle and lower classes.Tejada, p. 114 He was eight years old when the Mexican Revolution began. He could hear gunfire and came across dead bodies as a child. This would have an effect on his photography later. From 1908 to 1914 Alvarez Bravo attended elementary at the Patricio Sa√©nz boarding school in Tlalpan, but he had to leave school at the age of twelve when his father died. He worked as a clerk at a French textile factory for some time, and later at the Mexican Treasury Department. He studied accounting at night for a while but then switched to classes in art at the Academy of San Carlos. Alvarez Bravo met Hugo Brehme in 1923 and bought his first camera in 1924. He began experimenting with it, with some advice from Brehme and subscriptions to photography magazines. In 1927, he met photographer Tina Modotti. √Ålvarez Bravo had admired Modotti's work in magazines such as Forma and Mexican Folkways even before they met.Tejada, p. 104 She introduced him to a number of intellectuals and artists in Mexico City, including photographer Edward Weston, who encouraged him to continue with the craft. During his lifetime, Alvarez Bravo married three times, with all three wives photographers in their own right. His first wife was Lola Alvarez Bravo, whom he married in 1925, just as he was beginning his career as a freelance photographer. He taught her the craft but she did not achieve the renown that he did. They had one son, Manuel and separated in 1934. His second wife was Doris Heyden and his third was French photographer Colette √Ålvarez Urbajtel. In 1973 he donated his personal collection of photographs and cameras to the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. An additional 400 photographs are purchased by the Mexican government for the Museo de Arte Moderno. He died on October 19, 2002. Career √Ålvarez Bravo's photography career spanned from the late 1920s to the 1990s. It formed in the decades after the Mexican Revolution (1920s to 1950s) when there was significant creative output in the country, much of it sponsored by the government wanting to promote a new Mexican identity based on both modernity and the country's indigenous past. Although he was photographing in the late 1920s, he became a freelance photographer full-time in 1930, quitting his government job. That same year, Tina Modotti was deported from Mexico for political activities and she left Alvarez Bravo her camera and her job at Mexican Folkways magazine. For this publication, Alvarez Bravo began photographing the work of the Mexican muralists and other painters. During the rest of the 1930s, he established his career. He met photographer Paul Strand in 1933 on the set of the film \\"Redes\\", and worked with him briefly. In 1938, he met French Surrealist artist Andr√© Breton, who promoted Alvar√©z Bravo's work in France, exhibiting it there. Later, Breton asked for a photograph for the cover of catalog for an exhibition in Mexico. Alvarez Bravo created ‚ÄúLa buena fama durmiendo‚Äù (The good reputation sleeping), which Mexican censors rejected due to nudity. The photograph would be reproduced many times after that however. Alvarez Bravo trained most of the next generation of photographers including Nacho L√≥pez, H√©ctor Garc√≠a and Graciela Iturbide.Mraz, p. 7 From 1938 to 1939, he taught photography at the Escuela Central de Artes Pl√°sticas, now the National School of Arts (UNAM). In the latter half of the 1960s he taught at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematogr√°ficos. From 1943 to 1959, he worked in the Mexican film industry doing still shots, prompting him to experiment some with cinema. In 1949, he collaborated with Jos√© Revueltas in an experimental film called Coatlicue. In 1957 he worked making stills for the film Nazar√≠n by Luis Bu√±uel. His career included over 150 individual exhibitions of his work along with participation in over 200 collective exhibitions. In 1928, a photograph of his was chosen to be exhibited in the First Sal√≥n Mexciano de la Fotograf√≠a. His first individual exhibition was at the Galer√≠a Posada in Mexico City in 1932. In 1935, he exhibited with Henri Cartier-Bresson at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, with catalogue texts from Langston Hughes and Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n. In 1940 his work was part of a surrealist exhibition by Andr√© Breton at the gallery belonging to In√©s Amor. Edward Steichen selected three of Bravo's pictures for MoMA's 1955 The Family of Man exhibition which was exhibited around the world, seen by more people than any other to date. In 1968, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a retrospective of four decades of Alvarez Bravo's work. He exhibited at the Pasadena Art Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1971, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington in 1978, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 1983 and the National Library in Madrid in 1985. From 1994 to 1995 Evidencias de lo invisible, cien fotograf√≠as (Evidence of the Invisible, One Hundred Photographs) was presented at the Fine Arts Museum in New Delhi, the Imperial Palace in Beijing and the Bel√©m Cultural Center in Lisbon. In 2001, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles hosted a retrospective of his work. His first publication was in 1945, writing the book ‚ÄúEl arte negro.‚Äù His photographs appeared in many publications over his career including the book M√©xico: pintura de hoy by Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n in 1964. He co wrote and provided the photographs for the book Instante y revelaci√≥n along with Octavio Paz in 1982. In 1959 he founded the Fondo Editorial de la Pl√°stica Mexicana with Leopoldo M√©ndez, Gabriel Figueroa, Carlos Pellicer and Rafael Carrillo which produces books on Mexican art. He spent most of the 1960s with this project, putting him in relative obscurity until the 1970s when his work was widely exhibited again. Alvarez Bravo's first significant award for his photography was first prize for an image of two lovers on a boat at the Feria Regional Ganadera in Oaxaca. In 1931, he won first prize at a competition sponsored by the La Tolteca company with an image called La Tolteca. Diego Rivera was one of the judges. The rest of his awards did not come until the 1970s. These include the Elias Sourasky Arts Prize in 1974, Premio Nacional de Arte and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1975, nomination for the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in 1982, Hasselblad Award in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1984, Master of Photography Prize from the International Center of Photography in New York in 1987, Hugo Erfurth International Photography Award and the Agfa Gevaert Prize in Leverkusen, Germany in 1991, nomination as Creador Em√©rito by CONACULTA in 1993 and Gold Medal Award from the National Arts Club in New York along with the Leica Medal of Excellence and the Grand Cross of Merit Order in Portugal in 1995. Alvarez Bravo continued to photograph until his death. About a year before his death, when he could no longer travel, he photographed nudes. He stated that ‚ÄúIt wasn't the sort of work one can complain about.‚Äù Significant collections of his work exist in Mexico and the United States. The Centro Fotogr√°fico √Ålvarez Bravo is a non profit association founded in 1996 by Francisco Toledo in the city of Oaxaca. It contains six halls for temporary exhibitions of his photographs as well as works by others. It has a library specializing in photography and a permanent collection of 4,000 photographs by √Ålvarez Bravo and other notable photographers. The other is a collection of photographs that Alvarez Bravo began putting together himself in 1980 for the Fundaci√≥n Cultural Televisa. This consists of 2,294 images, custody of which is now with the Casa Lamm Cultural Center in Mexico City which built a special vault for it. Since his death the photo archive at Casa Lamm continues to receive petitions for reproductions of the photographs from both Mexico and abroad, as well as provide assistance to researchers about the photographer and the times he lived in. Outside of Mexico, two significant collections are at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. Artistry He was the pioneer of artistic photography in Mexico and the most important figure in Latin American photography for the 20th century. His work reached creative heights from the 1920s through the 1940s.Mraz, p. 6 In developing his craft, he recognized the difficulties of the photographic medium, such as the inability to capture the past and the difficulty of avoiding stereotyping. His primary subjects were nudes, folk art and rituals, especially burials and decorations, shop windows, urban streets and everyday interactions. Although he did much of his work in Mexico City, Diego Rivera encouraged him to visit the towns and rural areas. Alvarez Bravo's photographs almost never depict trappings of political power, instead preferring subjects related to everyday life. Most of his subjects are nameless.Tejada, p.113-114 In addition to his main subjects, he also sought out certain textures, especially the surfaces of walls and floors. One example is ‚ÄúHair on Tile‚Äù featuring a long lock of wavy hair on a tile floor with star and cross designs.Tejada, p. 116 He used large cameras which produced more detail in the finished print. However, he was more concerned with the images he photographed than the technical quality of his prints. The compositions were generally excellent and the images poetic. He gave titles to his photographs in order to distinguish them. The titles of his photographs often are based on Mexican myth and culture. Alvarez Bravo's early work was influenced by European Cubism, French Surrealism and abstract art.Tejada, p. 96 Much of this came from two books, one of Picasso and another on Japanese prints with work by Hokusai that influenced his early landscape work. However, his career was being established during the post Mexican Revolution era, when there was a cultural and political push to redefine Mexican identity.Tejada, p. 103 In the 1930s, he abandoned European influences for more Mexican themes and styles, influenced by the art of the Mexican muralism movement.Tejada, p. 105 His photographs became more complicated with ancient symbols of blood, death and religion along with the paradoxes and ambiguities of Mexican culture. His experience with death as a child as the Mexican Revolution was unfolding played a role in his photographs from the explicit ‚ÄúStriking Worker, Assassinated‚Äù to the more subtle ‚ÄúPortrait of the Eternal.‚Äù However, while Alvarez Bravo was interested in Mexico's cultural identity, he was not particularly political. Alvarez Bravo's trademark was the ability to capture hidden and surreal essences beneath the apparently ordinary images he was photographing. Alvarez Bravo was the first Mexican photographer to take a militantly anti-picturesque stand, to avoid stereotyping Mexico's variety of cultures. To avoid the picturesque, he had to present images that went against what was expected from photographs about Mexico even if photographing something classically Mexican. One way Alvarez Bravo did this was to employ a sense of irony, to the addition of an element contrary to expectations and the main focus of the photograph. For example, while photographing an indigenous man in typical clothing (Se√±or de Papantla 1934), the man stares defiantly back into the camera. Another was to capture people doing ordinary activities avoiding romanticism and sentimentality. One example is a photo of a mother and a shoeshine boy (La mama del bolero y el bolero 1950s) eating lunch together. Another is a group of men eating at a lunch counter (Los agachadfos 1934). Alvarez Bravo used Mexico City's streets and squares to frame statements about the social and cultural realities of the city.Tejada, p. 95 He used his lens to present Mexico City not in terms of moral or heroic, but rather of social relationships and material clashes.Tejada, p. 126 These included class and gender roles. During the 1930s and 1940s, he discovered increasingly more complex ways to frame the contradictions of Mexico's urban life into social statements. In his pictures, feminine identity has a complex symbolic range where sex overlaps with other social identities of everyday life.

The game runs on the ZAMN engine. Gameplay At the start of the game, the player chooses an avatar, male or female. The evil Space Slug forces, led by the Sultan of Slime, have launched a sudden attack on humanity, quickly occupying the majority of planets in the galaxy, and forcing the Sidereal Shock Troops to recruit soldiers to counter the threat. After passing three \\"grueling tests\\", the player is made a \\"21-star general\\" and transported to the E.S.S. Dire Wolf, where they meet the ship's Flexible Interactive Digital Omnicomputer (FIDO, represented by a dog). From this point, the player receives various orders, from rescuing stranded agents on various cartoon-like worlds, retrieving upgrade parts for the ship and the player, and repairing various machines which help keep the universe running. The vast majority of the game, however, is spent hunting down and driving the Slugs off different planets; when arriving at an occupied world, the game switches to an overhead Asteroids-esque view, where the Dire Wolf must shoot down all enemies (beginning with small, weak ships, with larger ones featured later in the game). After this, the player dons a suit of powered armor and descends to the planet's surface to hunt down the Slugs. Once this is finished, any additional tasks (such as speaking to people, opening up passages to the different machines) can be completed, or the player can return to the Dire Wolf and head to the next planet. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation, noting the game's incongruous mix of cutesy graphics and storyline with remarkably complex gameplay and levels, concluded that \\"What exactly this game's intended audience is supposed to be, we can't figure out, but it deserves at least a small one.\\" He gave it three out of five stars.

Its ruling family was the House of F√ºrstenberg. History The county emerged when Egino IV, Count of Urach by marriage, inherited large parts of the Duchy of Z√§hringen upon the death of Duke Berthold V in 1218, and it was originally called the county of Freiburg. Egino's grandson, Count Henry, started naming himself after his residence at F√ºrstenberg Castle around 1250. The county was partitioned in 1284 between itself and the lower county of Dillingen, and then again in 1408 between F√ºrstenberg-F√ºrstenberg and F√ºrstenberg-Wolfach. Over the centuries, the various rulers expanded their territories to include the Landgraviate of Baar, the Lordships of Gundelfingen, Hausen, Heiligenberg, H√∂wen, and Me√ükirch, and the Landgraviate of St√ºhlingen in Germany, as well as domains around K≈ôivokl√°t Castle (), Bohemia, Tav√≠kovice (German: Taikowitz) in Moravia and Weitra in Austria. In 1667, F√ºrstenberg-Heiligenberg was raised to a principality and received a vote at the Reichstag. In 1744, various F√ºrstenberg territories were reunified to the Principality of F√ºrstenberg-F√ºrstenberg, as all lines except one had become extinct. The Rheinbundakte of 1806 dissolved the state of F√ºrstenberg. Most of its territory was given to Baden, and smaller parts were given to W√ºrttemberg, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and Bavaria. Geography As of 1789, the territory consisted of five larger, isolated parts as well as several smaller exclaves. The five larger parts were: * Around Donaueschingen, including the Landgraviate of Baar and the Lordship of H√∂wen as well as F√ºrstenberg Castle. Cities include Donaueschingen, H√ºfingen, Engen, Neustadt. Bordered by Austria, W√ºrttemberg, the Abbacy of St. Blaise and others. Given to Baden. * The Lordship of Hausen.

By 1737, more than 7,000 people lived in Arzamas and the town became a major transit center on the route from Moscow to eastern parts of Russia. It was known for its geese and onions as well as leather crafts. Catherine the Great in 1781 granted town status to Arzamas and a coat of arms based on the colors of the Arzamas regiment. In the early 19th century, Arzamas had over twenty churches and cathedrals, the foremost being the Resurrection Cathedral. It was built in the Empire style to commemorate the Russian victory over Napoleon in 1812. Alexander Stupin art school was located in Arzamas between 1802 and 1862 and many famous Russian artists studied there, including Vasily Perov. By the early 20th century it was still an important centre of trade, and had tanneries, oil, flour, tallow, dye, soap and iron works; knitting was an important domestic industry, while sheepskins and sail-cloth were articles of trade. The 1897 population was 10,591. From 1954 to 1957, Arzamas was the center of Arzamas Oblast, a short-lived administrative unit that was split from Gorky Oblast and later merged back into it.

A memorable experience was his service on the \\"Lady Lex\\" USS Lexington (CV-2). Weber was the Officer of the Deck on the Lexington when the ship received word of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the Battle of the Coral Sea his carrier sank the Japanese aircraft carrier Sh≈çh≈ç and was in turn mortally damaged on May 8, 1942. Weber often regaled his students with the story of how the Lexington glowed incandescent as she slipped beneath the waves. Later, he commanded the sub-chaser SC-690, first in the Caribbean, and later in the Mediterranean Sea. In that role, he took part in the invasion of Sicily at Gela Beach, in July, 1943.U. S. Naval Academy Class of 1940 Archive. Retrieved on 2015-02-24. He studied electronics at the Naval Postgraduate School in 1943-45, and from 1945‚Äì1948, he headed electronic countermeasures design for the Navy's Bureau of Ships, in Washington, DC. He resigned from the navy as a lieutenant commander in 1948 to become a professor of engineering. Early post-naval career; development of the MASER In 1948, he joined the engineering faculty of the University of Maryland, College Park. A condition of his appointment was that he should quickly attain a PhD. Thus, he did his PhD studies, on microwave spectroscopy, at night, while already a faculty member. He completed his PhD, with a thesis entitled Microwave Technique in Chemical Kinetics, from The Catholic University of America in 1951. Building on his naval expertise in tube microwave engineering,American Institute of Physics Oral History Interview with Joseph Weber in 1983 during the course of his doctoral research he worked out the idea of coherent microwave emissions. He submitted a paper in 1951 for the June 1952 Electron Tube Research Conference held in Ottawa,Innovation Hall of Fame which was the earliest public lecture on the principles behind the laser and the maser. After this presentation, RCA asked Weber to give a seminar on this idea, and Charles Hard Townes asked him for a copy of the paper. Townes was working along similar lines,Charles H. Townes ‚Äì Nobel Lecture as were Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov. Although Weber was jointly nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1962 and 1963 for his contributions to the development of the laser, it was Townes, Basov, and Prokhorov, the first to build working prototypes of these devices, who received the 1964 Prize, \\"for fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser‚Äìlaser principle.\\" Work on gravitational wave detection His interest in general relativity led Weber to use a 1955‚Äì1956 sabbatical, funded by a Guggenheim Fellowship, to study gravitational radiation with John Archibald Wheeler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ and the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. At the time, the existence of gravitational waves was not widely accepted due to the inability to duplicate the positive results that Weber had detected. Weber was the first to make a real attempt to detect these waves. After he began publishing papers on the detection of gravitational waves, he moved from the Engineering department to the Physics department at Maryland. He developed the first gravitational wave detectors (Weber bars) in the 1960s, and began publishing papers with evidence that he had detected these waves. In 1972, he sent a gravitational wave detection apparatus to the moon (the \\"Lunar Surface Gravimeter\\", part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package) on the Apollo 17 lunar mission.Lunar Surface Gravimeter =Claims of gravitational wave detection discredited= In the 1970s, the results of these gravitational wave experiments were largely discredited, although Weber continued to argue that he had detected gravitational waves.Early days in the Sociology of Gravitational Waves In order to test Weber's results, IBM Physicist Richard Garwin built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's. In six months, it detected only one pulse, which was most likely noise.Marcia Bartusiak, Einstein's unfinished symphony, Joseph Henry Press, 2000, p. 102 David Douglass, another physicist, had discovered an error in Weber's computer program that, he claimed, produced the daily gravitational wave signals that Weber claimed to have detected. Because of the error, a signal seemed to appear out of noise. Garwin aggressively confronted Weber with this information at the Fifth Cambridge Conference on Relativity at MIT in June 1974. A series of letters was then exchanged in Physics Today. Garwin asserted that Weber's model was \\"insane, because the universe would convert all of its energy into gravitational radiation in 50 million years or so, if one were really detecting what Joe Weber was detecting.\\" \\"Weber,\\" Garwin declared, \\"is just such a character that he has not said, 'No, I never did see a gravity wave.' And the National Science Foundation, unfortunately, which funded that work, is not man enough to clean the record, which they should.\\" In 1972, Heinz Billing and colleagues at Max Planck Institute for Physics built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's to verify his claim but found no results. The process of how physicists and the general public came to reject Weber's claims that he had found gravitational waves is described in several books and articles, including Gravitational Wave Blues, Excerpt from excerpted from Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space, by Janna Levin; several articles and the books Gravity's Shadow and Gravity's Ghost: Scientific Discovery in the 21st Century by sociologist Harry Collins; and Einstein's Unfinished Symphony by Marcia Bartusiak. Weber himself continued to maintain his gravitational wave detection equipment until his death. =Discovery of gravitational waves by LIGO= On February 11, 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration teams held a press conference to announce that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging, on Rosh Hashanah 2015, (Weber's yahrtzeit), using the Advanced LIGO detectors. During the announcement, Weber was credited by numerous speakers as the founder of the field, including by Kip Thorne, who co-founded LIGO and also devoted much of his career to the search for gravitational waves. Later, Thorne told the Washington Post, \\"He really is the founding father of this field.\\" Weber's second wife, astronomer Virginia Trimble, was seated in the front row of the audience during the LIGO press conference. In an interview with Science afterwards, Trimble was asked if Weber really saw gravitational waves, to which she replied: \\"I don't know. But I think if there had been two technologies going forward they would have pushed each other, as collaborators not as competitors, and it might have led to an observation sooner.\\" Work on neutrino detection In the course of defending his work on gravitational wave detection, Weber began related work on neutrino detection. Assuming infinite crystal stiffness, Weber calculated that it could be possible to detect neutrinos using sapphire crystals, and published experimental results on neutrino scattering with these crystals. Weber also patented the idea of using vibrating crystals to generate neutrinos. His experimental results contradicted previous and subsequent findings from other experiments, but Weber's neutrino theories continue to be tested. Legacy Although his attempts to find gravitational waves with bar detectors are considered to have failed, Weber is widely regarded as the father of gravitational wave detection efforts, including LIGO, MiniGrail, and several HFGW research programs around the world. His notebooks contained ideas for laser interferometers; later such a detector was first constructed by his former student Robert Forward at Hughes Research Laboratories. The Joseph Weber Award for Astronomical Instrumentation was named in his honor. Personal life Joseph Weber was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on 17 May 1919, the last of four children born to Yiddish-speaking immigrant parents. His name was \\"Yonah\\" until he entered grammar school. He had no birth certificate, and his father had taken the last name of \\"Weber\\" to match an available passport in order to emigrate to the US. Thus, Joe Weber had little proof of either his family or his given name, which gave him some trouble in obtaining a passport at the height of the red scare. His first marriage, to his high school classmate Anita Straus, ended with her death in 1971. His second marriage was to astronomer Virginia Trimble. He had 4 sons (from his first marriage), and six grandchildren. Joseph Weber died on 30 September 2000 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during treatment for lymphoma that had been diagnosed about three years earlier.

An intervening cause will generally absolve the tortfeasor of liability for the victim's injury only if the event is deemed a superseding cause. A superseding cause is an unforeseeable intervening cause. By contrast, a foreseeable intervening cause typically does not break the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible for the victim's injury‚Äîunless the event leads to an unforeseeable result. For example, if a defendant had carelessly spilled gasoline near a pile of cigarette butts in an alley behind a bar, the fact that a bar patron later carelessly threw a cigarette butt into the gasoline would be deemed a foreseeable intervening cause, and would not absolve the defendant of tort liability. However, if the bar patron intentionally threw the cigarette butt into the gasoline because he wanted to see it ignite, this intentional act would likely be deemed unforeseeable, and therefore superseding.Watson v. Ky. & Ind. Bridge & Ry Co., 137 Ky. 619, 126 S.W. 146 (1910) In order for the intervening cause to be deemed superseding and relieve the tortfeasor of liability, both the act/event and the injury must be unforeseeable. For example, assume that contractor A was responsible for fencing or marking a hole in the ground and negligently fails to do so while contractor B is working in the hole. Then, a driver‚Äîwho negligently failed to take his medication before driving and therefore does not see clearly‚Äîdrives into the unmarked hole and injures contractor B. Contractor A will still be liable for the damage to contractor B despite the driver's negligence in not taking medication. This is because, even though the negligent act of the driver is not foreseeable, the fact of injury by a driver is foreseeable (i.e., a car falling in because there is no guard).Derdiarian v.

This method may have been developed to bridge the many varieties of Chinese--for example, the numbers 4 () and 10 () are hard to distinguish in some dialects. Some suggest that it was also used by business people during bargaining (i.e., to convey a bid by feeling the hand gesture in a sleeve) when they wish for more privacy in a public place. These gestures are fully integrated into Chinese Sign Language. Methods While the five digits on one hand can easily express the numbers one through five, six through ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication. The gestures are rough representations of the Chinese numeral characters they represent. The system varies in practice, especially for the representation of \\"7\\" to \\"10\\". Two of the systems are listed below: * Six (ÂÖ≠) **The little finger and thumb are extended, other fingers closed, sometimes with the palm facing the signer. (The extended thumb indicates one set of 5) * Seven (‰∏É) **In North China: The fingertips are all touching, pointed upwards; or just the fingertips of the thumb and first two fingers [note: this is the most common method]; another method is similar to the eight described immediately below, except that the little finger is also extended. **In North China: The index finger and middle finger point outward, with the thumb extended upwards, sometimes with the palm facing the observer. (The extended thumb indicates one set of 5) **In coastal South China: The index finger points down with the thumb extended, mimicking the shape of a \\"7\\". * Eight (ÂÖ´) **In North China: The thumb and index finger make an \\"L\\", other fingers closed, with the palm facing the observer. **In North China: The index finger and middle finger point down, often with tips on a horizontal surface, making the Chinese number 8 (\\"ÂÖ´\\"). **In coastal South China: The thumb, index finger, and middle finger are extended. * Nine (‰πù) **In Mainland China: The index finger makes a hook, other fingers closed, sometimes with the palm facing the signer. **In Taiwan: The thumb, index finger, middle finger, and ring finger are extended. **In Hong Kong: Both methods are used. * Ten (ÂçÅ) **The fist is closed with the palm facing the signer; or the middle finger crosses an extended index finger, facing the observer. Some Chinese distinguish between zero and ten by having the thumb closed or open respectively. **The arms are raised and the index fingers of both hands are crossed in a \\"ÂçÅ\\" (making the Chinese number ten) with the palms facing in opposite directions, often in front of the face of the signer. Use of the signs corresponds to the use of numbers in the Chinese language. For instance, the sign for five just as easily means fifty. A two followed by a six, using a single hand only, could mean 260 or 2600 etc. besides twenty-six. These signs also commonly refer to days of the week, starting from Monday, as well as months of the year, whose names in Chinese are enumerations. In different regions signs for numbers vary significantly. One may interpret the \\"8\\" sign as a \\"7\\". The \\"index finger-hook\\" symbol for 9, also means \\"death\\" in other contexts. The numbers zero through five are simpler: * Zero („Äá) **In North China: The fist is closed. It may be interpreted as 10 depending on the situation, though some Chinese distinguish between zero and ten by having the thumb closed or open respectively. **In coastal South China: The thumb and the index finger make a circle, with the last three fingers closed. * One (‰∏Ä) **The index finger is extended. * Two (‰∫å) **The index and middle fingers are extended. * Three (‰∏â) **With the index finger and thumb closed, the last three fingers are extended. **The thumb holds the little finger in palm with the middle three fingers extended. * Four (Âõõ) **The thumb is held in palm with the four fingers extended. * Five (‰∫î) ** All five digits are extended. ** Only thumb is extended, upwards or outwards, with the palm facing the signer. Counting with fingers is often different from expressing a specific number with a finger gesture. When counting, the palm can be either facing its owner or the audience, depending on the purpose. Before counting, all fingers are closed; counting starts by extending the thumb as the first, then the index finger as the second, till all fingers are extended as the fifth; then counting can be continued by folding fingers with the same sequence, from thumb through the little finger, for counting from the sixth through the tenth. Repeating the same method for counting larger numbers. One can also starts counting with all fingers extended. Some believe that for formal scenario such as giving speech or presentation, counting with the palm facing the audience and starting with all fingers extended is more polite, since the gesture of folding of fingers representing bowing. When playing drinking finger games (ÂàíÊã≥, ÁåúÊã≥), slightly different sets of finger gestures of numbers is used. One of them is: * Zero („Äá) **The fist is closed. * One (‰∏Ä) **The thumb is extended with all other fingers folded toward the palm. * Two (‰∫å) **The thumb and index finger make an \\"L\\", other fingers closed. * Three (‰∏â) **With the last two fingers closed and the rest fingers (the thumb and the first two fingers) extended, or **With the index finger and thumb closed, the last three fingers are extended. * Four (Âõõ) **The thumb is held in palm with the four fingers extended. * Five (‰∫î) ** All five digits are extended.

In 1864, Toucouleur ruler El Hajj Umar Tall died near Bandiagara, leaving the then- dominant Toucouleur Empire tottering and a number of chiefs rushing to break their own pieces away from the newly weakened federation. By far the most successful among them was Samori Tour√© of what is now southwestern Guinea. Army organization Samori's army was well equipped with European firearms and a complex structure of permanent units. His army was divided into an infantry wing of sofa (Mandinka for infantry, usually slaves) and a cavalry wing. By 1887, Samori could field 30,000 to 35,000 infantry and about 3,000 cavalry.Boahen, 1990 Infantry were divided into units of 10 to 20 men known as a \\"se\\" or \\"kulu\\". Cavalry were divided into bands of 50 horsemen called a \\"sere\\".Boahen, 1989 Kulus were under the command of a Kun-Tigui, meaning chief. Ten kulus equaled a bolo (100‚Äì200 men). The bolo, which in the Banmana language translates to \\"arm\\", was strictly an infantry unit.Ogot, 463 The bolo kun-tigui commanded this unit. Expansion Samori's campaign swept first through his neighbors, the B√©r√©t√© and the Ciss√©, and then into the Wassoulou region (the border of today's Guinea and Mali). In 1876, he secured the Bur√© gold mines, and by 1878, his position was secure enough to officially declare himself faama (military leader) of a new Wassoulou Empire. Later conquests included Kankan, a key Malinke trading center, and sections of what are now Sierra Leone and northern C√¥te d'Ivoire. The Mandingo Wars From 1880 until his death, Samori's ambition was opposed by the expansion of the French. He entered into combat with the colonial army, defeating them on several occasions, including a notable victory on 2 April 1882, at Woyowayanko in the face of French heavy artillery. Nonetheless, Samori was forced to sign several treaties ceding territory to the French between 1886 and 1889. Samori began a steady retreat, but the fall of other resistance armies, particularly Babemba Traor√© at Sikasso, permitted the colonial army to launch a concentrated assault against his forces. On 29 September 1898, he was captured by the French Commandant Goudraud and exiled to Gabon, marking the end of the Wassoulou Empire.

During World War II, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was lifted briefly to allow for hemp fiber production to create ropes for the U.S. Navy but after the war hemp reverted to its de facto illegal status. History The film was made to encourage farmers to grow hemp for the war effort because other industrial fibers, often imported from overseas, were in short supply. The film shows a history of hemp and hemp products, how hemp is grown, and how hemp is processed into rope, cloth, cordage and other products. Before 1989, the film was relatively unknown. The United States government denied ever having made such a film. The United States Department of Agriculture library and the Library of Congress told all interested parties that no such movie was made by the USDA or any branch of the U.S. government. Two VHS copies were recovered and donated to the Library of Congress on 19 May 1989 by Maria Farrow, Carl Packard, and Jack Herer. The only known copy in 1976 was a 3/4\\" broadcast quality copy of the film that was originally obtained by William Conde in 1976 from a reporter for the Miami Herald and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church of Jamaica. It was given in trust that it would be made available to as many as possible. It was put into the hands of Jack Herer by William Conde during the 1984 Oregon Marijuana Initiative. The film is now available in numerous locations on the Internet. The 1990 case that the film Hemp For Victory was delivered in. In July 1989, Jack Herer together with Chris Wright, of the Grassroots Party, attempted to obtain a copy from the National Archives where it was listed, but the curators were unable to locate the film. Subsequently, in May 1990, the founder of The Institute for Hemp, John Birrenbach, recovered a copy of the film from the National Archives. The film was a two part film the first section being 6:46 the second being 7:16 long. Together the approx 15 minute film detailed the cultivation of cannabis for fiber. This was the first recovery of the film from a government source. This film can now be downloaded from the National Archives. Hemp for Victory was produced by the US Department of Agriculture, and contained scenes from the 1926 silent film Old Ironsides. It is public domain and is freely available for download from the Internet Archive. The film, as well as clips shown, was referenced to in an episode of 10 Things You Don't Know About on marijuana and its history. Book Hemp for Victory is also the title of a book about hemp, published 2006 in London by Whitaker Press (). It is the work of several authors active in the hemp world, including Kenyon Gibson, Nick and Cindy Mackintosh, Woody Harrelson, Mina Hegaard and Sam Heslop. Sequel In 2008 efforts were made to make a sequel of the movie by UK-based production houses as a series of short films. It was developed as a three film series of 60 minutes each. The first part is starred by David Hayman and Jack Herer. The second part released at the 2009 Seattle HempFest had Steve Levine and Andrea Hermann on the speaker panel. The movie did not have a full official release. It was released as a 2012 remake at select locations. The conceptualisation of the movie was based on inputs from Smithsonian Institution, Greenpeace, MardiGrass, Robert West, Dr Tapan Kumar Pradhan and Howard Marks.

It is particularly common in central and South America, central and eastern Europe, Japan and northern India; it is also common in certain ethnic groups e.g. Native American Indians and Hispanics. If it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the gallbladder, part of the liver and associated lymph nodes. Most often it is found after symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting occur, and it has spread to other organs such as the liver. It is a rare cancer that is thought to be related to gallstones building up, which also can lead to calcification of the gallbladder, a condition known as porcelain gallbladder. Porcelain gallbladder is also rare. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. The outlook is poor for recovery if the cancer is found after symptoms have started to occur, with a 5-year survival rate close to 3%. Signs and symptoms *Steady pain in the upper right abdomen *Indigestion *Dyspepsia (gas) *Bilious vomit *Weakness *Loss of appetite *Weight loss *Jaundice and vomiting due to obstruction Early symptoms mimic gallbladder inflammation due to gallstones. Later, the symptoms may be that of biliary and stomach obstruction. Of note, Courvoisier's law states that in the presence of a palpably enlarged gallbladder which is nontender and accompanied with mild painless jaundice, the cause is unlikely to be gallstones. This implicates possible malignancy of the gallbladder or pancreas, and the swelling is unlikely due to gallstones due to the chronic inflammation association with gallstones leading to a shrunken, non- distensible gallbladder. However, Ludwig Georg Courvoisier's original observations, published in Germany in 1890, were not originally cited as a law, and no mention of malignancy or pain (tenderness) was made. These points are commonly misquoted or confused in the medical literature. Risk factors * Gender‚Äî approximately twice as common in women than men, usually in seventh and eighth decades * Obesity * Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis * Primary sclerosing cholangitis * Chronic typhoid infection of gallbladder; chronic Salmonella typhi carriers have 3 to 200 times higher risk of gallbladder cancer than non-carriers and 1‚Äì6% lifetime risk of development of cancer * Various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with gallbladder cancer; however, existing genetic studies in GBC susceptibility have so far been insufficient to confirm any associationSrivastava K, Srivastava A, Sharma KL, Mittal B. Candidate gene studies in gallbladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Mutat Res. 2011 Jul‚ÄìOct;728(1‚Äì2):67‚Äì79. * Gall bladder polyps * Calcified gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder) * Congenital abnormalities of the bile duct such as choledochal cyst Diagnosis Early diagnosis is not generally possible. People at high risk, such as women or Native Americans with gallstones, are evaluated closely. Transabdominal ultrasound, CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, and MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) can be used for diagnosis. A large number of gallbladder cancers are found incidentally in patients being evaluated for cholelithiasis, or gallstone formation, which is far more common. A biopsy is the only certain way to tell whether or not the tumorous growth is malignant.

File:Gallbladder adenocarcinoma (2) histopathology.jpgGallbladder adenocarcinoma histopathology =Differential diagnosis= Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare form of gallbladder disease which mimics gallbladder cancer although it is not cancerous. It was first discovered and reported in the medical literature in 1976 by J.J. McCoy, Jr., and colleagues. Treatment If detected early in a stage where it has not spread, gall bladder cancer can be treated by surgery. Surgery for gallbladder cancer is called radical cholecystectomy or extended cholecystectomy. It entails the removal of gall bladder along with adequate removal of its liver bed to the healthy tissue. The lymph nodes in the vicinity are also removed. Sometimes removal of a large part of the liver called hepatectomy is required to completely remove the tumor. The bile duct if involved also needs to be removed. However, with gallbladder cancer's extremely poor prognosis, most patients will die within a year of surgery. If surgery is not possible, endoscopic stenting or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) of the biliary tree can reduce jaundice and a stent in stomach may relieve vomiting. Chemotherapy and radiation may also be used with surgery. If gallbladder cancer is diagnosed after cholecystectomy for stone disease (incidental cancer), re-operation to remove part of liver and lymph nodes is required in most cases. When it is done as early as possible, patients have the best chance of long-term survival and even cure. Epidemiology Most tumors are adenocarcinomas, with a small percent being squamous cell carcinomas. *Gallbladder cancer is relatively rare, affecting fewer than 5000 people in the United States per year *Gallbladder cancer is more common in South American countries, Japan, and Israel; in Chile, gallbladder cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths. *5th most common gastrointestinal cancer *Up to 5 times more common in women than men depending on population (e.g. 73% female in China * The age adjusted incidence rates of gall bladder cancer is highest in Chile, followed by in the state of Assam in IndiaNational Cancer Registry Programme (2013).Three-year report of population based cancer registries:2009-2011. NCDIR-ICMR, Bangalore. Prognosis The prognosis still remains poor. The cancer commonly spreads to the liver, bile duct, stomach, and duodenum.

Life and career Green's original name was Ian; he later legally changed it to William. Born in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy on 12 August 1923 to an unknown father, Green grew up in Essendon. Torn between becoming an architect or a cartoonist after leaving Essendon High School, he studied architecture at the Melbourne Technical College because his mother warned: \\"You'll starve if you're a cartoonist.\\" At the age of 18 he enlisted in the Australian Army, and was attached to the 15th Brigade Army Intelligence in New Guinea. He drew cartoons that were published in the army's newspaper. Following his discharge from the army at the end of World War II, Green resumed his architectural studies but he abandoned architecture in favour of a postwar rehabilitation art course at the National Gallery of Victoria, where his tutors included Sir William Dargie. During this time he submitted cartoons to The Herald. When the paper's political cartoonist, Sammy Wells, went on holiday for six weeks in 1946, Green was asked to fill in for him. His work appealed to the editor-in-chief, John Williams, and in 1947 he was invited to join The Herald staff permanently. He continued to be a political cartoonist for the paper until he retired in 1986, after 40 years in that role. Green was responsible for introducing the daily \\"pocket\\" cartoon, Weg's Day, a single column topical comment humorously presented, that appeared for the first time in 1949 and continued on the paper's front page for 38 years. On 14 May 1949, Green married Joan Hettie Currell in Milton, Queensland. Green continued working as a caricaturist and illustrator, with his work appearing in cricket books by Max Walker, on stamps and in children's books. Premiership posters In the 1954 VFL season, Green began drawing premiership posters of the winning teams of the Victorian Football League (VFL) Grand Final for the Weekend Herald. By 1966, Green's posters had become so popular that The Herald started producing and selling them after the grand final. The posters, generally featuring a caricature of the winning club's mascot smiling gleefully, continued to sell around 100,000 copies each year. Although the series started in 1954, Green produced posters for all the grand finals back to 1897 to satisfy collectors. An exhibition of all 55 of Green's original posters was staged at the National Sports Museum in 2009.Campbell, Shaun (8 September 2009). \\"Heathmont legend WEG goes on show for finals time\\", Maroondah Leader. Retrieved 25 March 2013. The tradition continued after Green's death, with Herald Sun cartoonist Mark Knight taking over as the illustrator of the posters from 2009. The family of the late cartoonist release a grand final poster every year in his memory from artwork supply by Green before he died. He told family that he wanted his posters to go on after he was gone. His private company, Weg Art, supplies the posters each year. Later life and death On 14 January 2005, the 82-year-old Green confronted a burglar running through his back yard in Heathmont, Victoria. After confronting the man, Green called the police and then proceeded to take pen to paper and produce a caricature. His art was immediately recognisable to the local police. The offender was soon apprehended at a local shop as the cartoon clearly showed the man responsible. Green died on 29 December 2008 at the Maroondah Hospital; he was survived by his wife Joan, daughter Lynette and son Ian. Honours In June 2001, Green received the Medal of the Order of Australia \\"for service to art as a cartoonist and illustrator, and to the community, particularly through the Good Friday Appeal of the Royal Children's Hospital.\\" In 2003 he received the Jim Russell Award from the Australian Cartoonists' Association in acknowledgement of his lifelong contribution to the profession of cartooning. In 2009 the Melbourne Press Club posthumously bestowed on him the Quill Award for Lifetime Achievement.

He came to power as a child under his regent mother Zenobia, who led a revolt against the Roman Empire and formed the independent Palmyrene Empire. Early life Lucius Julius Aurelius Septimius Vaballathus was born and raised in the city of Palmyra, an oasis settlement in the Syrian Desert in 259 to the king of kings of Palmyra, Odaenathus, and his second wife, queen consort of Palmyra, Zenobia. Vaballathus is the Latinized form of his Palmyrene name, WahballƒÅt, \\"Gift of AllƒÅt\\". As the Arabian goddess AllƒÅt came to be identified with Athena, he used Athenodorus as the Greek form of his name. He had a half-brother, Hairan I, born from his father and another woman, who reigned as co-king of kings with his father, and a lesser-known brother, Hairan II. He also might have had other brothers, who were mentioned in (and only known from) the Augustan History, Herennianus and Timolaus. Herennianus may be Hairan; while Timolaus is probably a fabrication. As King =Succession to the throne= In 267, his father Odaenathus and half- brother Hairan I were murdered by a relative, perhaps a cousin of Odaenthus's, named Maeonius. Maeonius ruled as a usurper and crowned himself emperor but was almost immediately killed, as no inscription or evidence for his rule exists. With Odaenathus and his oldest son dead, the succession came to his younger son, Vaballathus. The young Vaballathus was made king (rex consul imperator dux Romanorum, \\"illustrious King of Kings\\" and corrector totius orientis) of the Palmyrene Empire at eight years old. Being too young to rule, his mother Zenobia ruled as queen regent and was the de facto ruler of Palmyra. =Reign= Coinage bearing Vaballathus's and Aurelian's portraits. Initially the Roman emperor Aurelian recognized Vaballathus' rule, perhaps because he was engaged in conflict with the Gallic Empire in the west and hesitated to incite open warfare with the Palmyrene Empire. This mutual recognition is testified by early coins issued by Zenobia under Vaballathus's name, but also acknowledging Aurelian as emperor. In the coins, Aurelian is shown wearing a radiate crown that signifies his supremacy as emperor, and Vaballathus was crowned with a laurel wreath. The Alexandrian minted coins showed Aurelian in his first year and Vaballathus in his fourth year with Vaballathus adopting honorary titles possibly inherited from his father Odaenathus. Although the Palmyrene Empire was centred in Palmyra, Vaballathus and Zenobia probably spent most of their reign in Antioch, Syria's administrative capital. The relationship between the Roman Empire and the newly established Palmyrene empire deteriorated, and a series of Palmyrene conquests, done under the protective show of subordination to Rome, began around 270. In October of 270, a Palmyrene army of 70,000 invaded Egypt, and declared Zenobia, Vaballathus's mother, the Queen of Egypt. The Roman general Tenagino Probus was able to regain Alexandria in November, but was defeated and escaped to the fortress of Babylon, where he was besieged and killed by Zabdas, a Palmyrene general, who continued his march south and secured Egypt. Afterward, in 271, Zabbai, another Palmyrene general serving Zenobia, started the operations in Anatolia, and was joined by Zabdas in the spring of that year. The Palmyrenes subdued the Asian province of Galatia, and occupied the regional capital of Ancyra, marking the greatest extent of the Palmyrene expansion. Aurelian disappeared from Palmyrene coinage, while Zenobia and Vaballathus adopted the titles of Augusta and Augustus, respectively. Vaballathus was named in coins \\"King, Emperor, Dux Romanum leader of the Romans\\" and an open rebellion against Rome started. Defeat The route of Aurelian's campaign against Palmyra. In 272, the Emperor Aurelian crossed the Bosporus and advanced quickly through Anatolia. While the Roman general Marcus Aurelius Probus regained Egypt from Palmyra, the emperor continued his march and reached Tyana. Tyana fell from Palmyrene control; Aurelian up to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him, but he allegedly spared Tyana. Whatever the reason for his clemency, it paid off, as many more cities submitted to him upon seeing that the emperor would not exact revenge upon them. Passing through Issus, Aurelian defeated Zenobia in the Battle of Immae near Antioch. The Palmyrene armies retreated to Antioch, then later Emesa, while Aurelian advanced and took the former. The defeat at Emesa forced the Palmyrene armies to evacuate to the capital. The Romans began a siege, and tried to breach the city defences several times but were repelled, however, the situation worsened, so Zenobia, Vaballathus's mother, left the city and headed east to ask the Sasanian Empire for help. The Romans followed the queen, arrested her near the Euphrates, and brought her back to the emperor. Soon after, the Palmyrene citizens asked for peace, and the city fell. The Temple of Bel was looted and sacked by the Romans during the razing of Palmyra The end of Vaballathus's nominal rule came after losing the Siege of Palmyra. Vaballathus, his mother and her council were taken to Emesa and put on trial. Most of the high-ranking Palmyrene officials were executed, while Zenobia and Vaballathus's fates remain uncertain. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he most likely spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph. According to Zosimus, Vaballathus died on the way to Rome, but this theory has been neither confirmed nor disproved. Other sources have implied that after shipping the defeated Zenobia and Vaballathus to Rome, Aurelian allowed both of the rebels to live, but only after they had been marched through the streets of the imperial city in accordance with Roman traditions of celebrating military victories with a triumphal procession. This would have been humiliating, but better than death. This theory is supported by Aurelian's similar treatment of the Tetrici, Tetricus I and Tetricus II of the Gallic Empire, long-time enemies of Rome whom the emperor allowed to retire following their defeat at the Battle of Ch√¢lons in 274. The fate of Palmyra, however took a turn for the worse. In 273, a revolution was started by Septimius Apsaios declaring a relative of Zenobia, Septimius Antiochus, as Augustus. Aurelian marched to Palmyra, razing it. Buildings were smashed, citizens clubbed and massacred and Palmyra's holiest temples pillaged. The city was reduced and disappeared from historical records from that time, thus ending the ascendancy of Palmyra over Roman Asia Minor.
