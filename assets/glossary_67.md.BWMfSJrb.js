It primarily functions to mediate the first critical step in platelet adhesion, by facilitating binding to von Willebrand factor (VWF) on damaged sub- endothelium under conditions of high fluid shear stress. Although the primary ligand for the GPIb-V-IX receptor is VWF, it can also bind to a number of other ligands in the circulation such as thrombin, P-selectin, factor XI, factor XII, high molecular weight kininogen as well as bacteria. GPIb-IX-V offers a critical role in thrombosis, metastasis, and the life cycle of platelets, and is implicated in a number of thrombotic pathological processes such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Molecular structure =Overview= GPIb-IX-V consists of four different subunits namely: GPIbα (molecular weight (MW) 135 kDa), GPIbβ (MW 26 kDa), GPIX (MW 20 kDa) and GPV (MW 82kDa). The complex is assembled such that GPIbα, GPIbβ and GPIX form a highly integrated protein complex in a 1:2:1 stoichiometry; and this associates weakly with GPV resulting in an overall stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Each subunit of the complex is a type I transmembrane (TM) protein which consists of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) ectodomain (extracellular domain), a single transmembrane helix, and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail that lacks enzymatic activity. The quaternary stabilization of the receptor is facilitated by covalent and non-covalent interactions. The GPIbα subunit is linked to two GPIbβ subunits via membrane-proximal disulfide bonds, while GPIX associates itself tightly through non-covalent interactions with GPIb. The concomitant expression of all three subunits is required to allow the effective expression of GPIb-IX on the platelet cell surface and analysis of receptor expression in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has further supported that the interaction between these subunits also acts to stabilize them. View from the top of the membrane proximal portion of GPIb-IX indicating in red the disulfide bonds between GPIbα and GPIbβ. Each of the four subunits (GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX and GPV) is part of the leucine rich repeat motif superfamily. These leucine rich repeat sequences tend to be about 24 amino acids in length either occurring singly or in tandem repeats flanked by conserved N-terminal and C-terminal disulfide loop structures. Nevertheless, even though these structural similarities exist, distinctive genes that exist on different chromosomes of the genome code for the polypeptides that make up the GPIb-V-IX complex. The four genes that code for the components of the receptor in humans have a simple organization in which the coding sequence is contained within a single exon. This is with the exception of the gene for GPIbβ, which contains an intron 10 bases following the start codon. Human GPIbα is the product of a gene on chromosome 17 specifically 17p12, GPIbβ is the product of a gene on chromosome 22 specifically 22q11.2, while GPV and GPIX are products of genes found on chromosome 3 specifically 3q21 and 3q29 respectively. Under normal conditions, all four molecules are expressed exclusively in the platelet lineage. GPIbα, GPIbβ and GPIX are necessary for the effective biosynthesis of the receptor and are closely associated at the platelet membrane. Typically, a lack of a single subunit significantly decreases the surface expression of the entire receptor complex. =GPIbα= A ribbon diagram depicting the crystal structure of the GPIbα N-terminal domain including the VWF A1 and thrombin binding sites. GPIbα (CD42b) consisting of 610 amino acids is the major subunit and contains all known extracellular ligand-binding sites of the complex for example: the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF) has a binding region as marked in the N-terminal domain of GPIbα; while the thrombin binding site is contained in a conformationally flexible acidic residue-rich sequence containing sulfated tyrosines. A ribbon diagram depicting the various components of the GPIbα subunit. Dissection of the crystal structure of the GPIbα N-terminal leucine rich repeat domain discloses the presence of a single disulfide bond between cysteine (Cys) residues Cys4 and Cys17 in the N-capping region, and two disulfide bonds (Cys209-Cys248 and Cys211-Cys264) in the C-capping region. Furthermore, there are seven tandem leucine rich repeats and their flanking sequences in the central parallel β-coil region. This parallel β-coil region is made up of three sided coils stacked in layers and contains two asparagine residues (Asn21 and Asn159), which serve as N-glycosylation sites. Following the leucine rich repeat domain is the acidic residue-rich sequence containing sulfated tyrosines, the highly O-glycosylated macroglycopeptide, a stalk region of about 40 to 50 residues, a single transmembrane sequence and finally a cytoplasmic tail containing 96 amino acid residues which includes serine residues such as Ser587, Ser590 and Ser609 that can be phosphorylated. =GPIbβ, GPIX, GPV= GPIbβ (CD42c) contains 181 amino acids. In the extracellular domain (ectodomain), both the N-capping and C-capping regions, which flank the leucine rich repeat sequence, contain two interlocking disulfide bonds. Furthermore, there is only a single leucine-rich repeat giving rise to a much less curved parallel β-coil region as compared to that in GPIbα. GPIbβ contains only one N-glycosylation site (Asn41) and is disulfide linked to GPIbα immediately proximal to the plasma membrane of the platelet via Cys122 located at the junction of the extracellular and transmembrane domains. A ribbon diagram depicting the crystal structure of the GPIbβ extracellular domain. The N-terminus is positioned at the top, the concave β-strands sit to the right and the convex loops are positioned to the left. Disulfide bonds present in LRR regions are indicated in yellow. The GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain has a sequence of 34 amino acids. The region adjacent to the membrane is enriched in basic residues and Ser166 found more distally is phosphorylated and appears to have a role in platelet cytoskeletal rearrangement. GPIX (CD42a) contains 160 amino acids. The extracellular domain, which also only has a single leucine rich repeat sequence shares more than 45% sequence identity with GPIbβ counterpart. However, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences are considerably different. The GPIX cytoplasmic tail is short consisting of 8 residues and is not known to associate with intracellular proteins. There is also a cysteine residue (Cys154) located at the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The extracellular domain of GPV contains 13 leucine rich repeats flanked by N- and C- capping regions both containing two interlocking disulfide bonds. This is followed by a stalk region, the transmembrane sequence and a short cytoplasmic tail rich in basic residues. transmembrane (TM) domains. The image demonstrates the accessibility of the GPIbα transmembrane helix for direct association with the GPV transmembrane helix as well as the inaccessibility of the GPIX transmembrane helix. The GPV (CD42d) subunit is only weakly associated with the GPIb-IX part of the receptor complex through interactions between the transmembrane domains and has little impact on the surface expression of GPIb- IX, although GPIb-IX is required for efficient expression of GPV. Furthermore, GPV doesn’t appear to be critical for VWF binding or signal transduction. Role in disease Abnormalities of the GPIb-V-IX complex result in abnormal appearance and functioning of platelets resulting in Bernard–Soulier syndrome (BSS), a condition first described by Bernard J and Soulier J.P. It is a rare hereditary bleeding disorder most commonly with an autosomal recessive inheritance and diagnosed based on prolonged skin-bleeding time, a reduced number of very large platelets (macrothrombocytopenia) and defective ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. Bernard Soulier Syndrome is characterized by little or no expression of GPIb-IX on the surface of platelets which in turn has the same effect on GPV. There have been a number of mutations associated with BSS patients that have been mapped to GPIbα, GPIbβ and GPIX demonstrating that all three subunits are required for effective surface expression of the complex on platelets.

It is known from a partial skeleton discovered in the Dolomites of Northern Italy and was described in 2003. Description Megachirella is known exclusively from a partial skeleton, preserved in anatomical connection. The find includes an almost complete skull, the front half of the body and part of the front legs. The skull, although devoid of the front part of the snout, is rather robust and large; the neck is moderately elongated and the front legs are large and strong. The dimensions do not exceed in length, and the appearance is similar to that of a strong-legged lizard. Classification Megachirella was discovered in the Dont Formation of the area of Braies, in South Tyrol, and described in 2003. It was classified as a member of Lepidosauromorpha, the clade of reptiles that includes lizards, snakes, the tuatara and their closest extinct relatives, at the time. In particular, the fossils show some similarities, mainly in the skull, with some primitive forms such as the Eolacertilia. A phylogenetics analysis in 2013 confirmed that it was a lepidosauromorph closely related to the crown group Lepidosauria. A study in 2018, led by Tiago R. Simōes from the University of Alberta, found that Megachirella was a stem-squamate, making it the oldest known member of the order Squamata, the order that includes lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians (worm lizards). The study was conducted by performing high-resolution microfocus X-ray computed tomography (micro-CT) scans on the fossil specimen of Megachirella to gather detailed data about its anatomy. This data was then compared with a phylogenetic dataset combining the morphological and molecular data of 129 extant (living) and extinct reptilian taxa. The comparison revealed Megachirella had certain features that are unique to squamates. The study also found that geckoes are the earliest crown group squamates, not iguanians. Paleobiology Despite being found in marine deposits, the fossil of Megachirella shows no adaptation to aquatic life. On the contrary, characteristics like the strong front legs, the shape of the claws, the well-ossified carpus and the hollow ribs lead one to think that this animal was well adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. The specimen was probably transported to a shallow coastal environment due to heavy storms after it died.

Early life and education He attended elementary and secondary school in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. At age 16, he enrolled in the University of Toronto, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree (Modern Languages and Literatures) in 1963 and, subsequently, his Master of Arts (Germanic Languages and Literatures). While at university, he published poetry in a number of academic reviews and was editor of Acta Victoriana, the literary magazine of Victoria College. His work in Acta appeared alongside that of such notable writers as Northrop Frye, Margaret Atwood, and Dennis Lee. Academic career In 1974, after nine years of high school language instruction, both as a teacher and department head, he was appointed Co-ordinator of Modern Languages for the Scarborough Board of Education, in the city of Toronto. In this capacity, he was responsible for all modern languages, from Senior Kindergarten to grade 13, in a major metropolitan board of education with a student population of approximately 80,000. A focal point of his duties as co- ordinator was the implementation and administration of French Immersion and Extended French (Late Immersion) programs in both elementary and secondary schools. At the university level, he was for many years a lecturer in the Honours Specialist program for both French and German at the Faculty of Education of the University of Toronto. Professional leadership McConnell has held numerous leadership positions in Modern Languages at the provincial, national, and international levels. • President of the Canadian Association of Second Language Teachers • President of the Ontario Modern Language Teachers’ Association • Founding President of the Ontario Council of French Second Language Consultants • Director of the Ontario Education Association • Chairman of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education Advisory Board to the Modern Language Centre • Chairman of the Ontario Teachers’ Federation Education Committee • Editorial Director of the Canadian Modern Language Review • Chairman of the Ontario Association of Teachers of German In 1986, at the one hundredth anniversary conference of the Ontario Modern Language Teachers’ Association, he was honored with Life Membership. From 2000 to 2005, he was Co-ordinator of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) / Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) / Estonian Ministry of Education Language Immersion Project, providing leadership to the Estonian Government in its efforts to introduce Estonian immersion to its large Russian-speaking minority. This pioneering program is now being emulated in other countries such as Spain, The United Kingdom, and Kazakhstan.

Some sections of it are now disused. The railway ran from Duisburg via Oberhausen West, Bottrop Nord, Dorsten, Coesfeld, Steinfurt and Rheine to Quakenbrück where it connected with the network of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways. The majority of the line is now closed. The southern section to Bottrop is now used only for freight. The section between Dorsten and Coesfeld is still used for passengers as timetable route 424. Regionalverkehr Münsterland (RVM) operates freight traffic over the section between Rheine and Spelle. For a detailed view of the section between Sigle junction and Walzwerk, see the Duisburg-Wedau–Bottrop Süd railway. History The concession for the construction of 172.87 km-long railway line from Duisburg to Quakenbrück was granted to the Rhenish Railway Company on 9 June 1873. The line was completed on 1 July 1879 and thus entered into direct competition with the Wanne-Eickel–Hamburg railway, built by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company in the early 1870s, from the Ruhr via Munster and Osnabruck to Bremen (part of the \\"Hamburg–Venlo railway\\"). =Route= The competition led to the construction of the line on a relatively straight alignment. To be competitive, the line in the Münsterland and the area between Rheine and Quakenbrück had to run as far as possible without major diversions and had to pass to the west of the ridge of the Teutoburg Forest in order to reduce transport costs and travel times. This would give the new connection a financial advantage over its competitor's line, which had run to the east through Osnabrück and Diepholz in order to avoid the area of the Oldenburg State Railways. The Rhenish Railway Company, however, wished specifically to connect to the network of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways in Quakenbrück, in order to make a continuous connection to both the Hanseatic city of Bremen and to Wilhelmshaven (which had been under development as a base of the Prussian Navy since 1866). The Oldenburg State Railways had already opened the Oldenburg–Wilhelmshaven railway and the Oldenburg–Bremen railway in 1866/7 and the Oldenburg–Osnabrück railway was completed via Quakenbrück in 1875. =Similar projects= The Rhenish Railway Company had already distinguished itself before the construction of the Duisburg–Quakenbrück line by the establishment of other competing routes: *The construction of the Osterath–Dortmund Süd railway, which ran the partially parallel to the Duisburg–Dortmund railway opened by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company in 1847 and the Witten/Dortmund–Oberhausen/Duisburg railway completed by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company in 1862. * the construction of the Krefeld–Nijmegen line opened between 1863 and 1865 to compete with the Oberhausen–Arnhem railway opened by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company in 1856. * the Düsseldorf-Derendorf–Dortmund Süd railway completed in 1879 to compete with the Elberfeld–Dortmund railway completed by the Bergisch- Märkische Railway Company in 1849. =Regional significance= In addition to the national function of the line it also had regional importance. The section between Coesfeld and Rheine connected the lines of the Royal Westphalian Railway Company with the railway network of the western Münsterland. =Connections to coal mines= In contrast to the Osterath–Dortmund Süd railway of the Rhenish Railway Company, which connected to a number of coal mines, the Duisburg-Quakenbrück line had few connections to mining railways. The mines were the Jacobi and Franz Haniel pits in Oberhausen-Klosterhardt and the Osterfeld colliery. =Branch to Salzbergen= The plans for the line anticipated the construction of a 7.8 km-long branch line from Rheine to Salzbergen and this was authorised in 1878. Following the building of the Almelo–Salzbergen railway in 1865, the Rhenish Railway Company planned to establish a separate connection to the Dutch railway network in Emsland, parallel to the line opened on 23 June 1856 by the Hanoverian Western Railway (see also Löhne–Rheine railway and Emsland Railway). =Nationalisation= The construction of the branch to Salzbergen was not completed and was abandoned under a ministerial order on 31 March 1879 as a result of the nationalisation of the line. Line to the north of Rheine. The track alignment was prepared for a proposed second track. Its telephone poles still stand here. The railway line from Duisburg via Rheine to Quakenbrück and Oldenburg is comparable to other lines in north-west Germany, such as the Ruhr–Münster–Emden or Ruhr–Münster–Bremen lines, which had limited economic significance. This is especially true of the Rheine–Quakenbrück section. The low significance of the line was reflected in, among other things, the standard of technical equipment of the line: the Dorsten–Rheine section in 1935 was, along with the Lünen–Gronau and Münster–Gronau lines, one of the few lines under the administration of the railway division of Munster that was not equipped with electric block signalling. The line had military importance during the First World War due to the extensive coal shipments from the Ruhr to the naval base in Wilhelmshaven. =Destruction in the Second World War= After the nationalisation, the passenger service from Osterfeld nord to Duisburg Hbf was closed and instead passenger services ran to Oberhausen Central Station. At the end of the Second World War in 1945, all the bridges over the Rhine–Herne Canal and the Emscher river were blown up by the Wehrmacht. Passenger services were abandoned and freight traffic was later restored over a new bridge. Due to the complete destruction of Rheine station on 5 October 1944, services had to be suspended between Rheine and Quakenbrück. At that time, Rheine station only had two tracks available for through traffic, an emergency station had to be set up north of the station in Eichenstraße (Friedensplatz). Traffic on the Quakenbrück route was not resumed until the summer of 1945, but only between Spelle and Quakenbrück because the Ems bridge in Rheine (between Rheine station and Altenrheine station) and the bridge over the Dortmund-Ems canal between Altenrheine and Spelle had not been rebuilt. =Resumption of traffic= In November 1945, trains could run from Quakenbrück to Altenrheine again. From here, the Tecklenburg Northern Railway (Tecklenburger Nordbahn), a former light railway connecting Piesberg (near Osnabrück) and Rheine) ran a shuttle to Rheine-Stadtberg station and from there through the town centre to Hues-Ecke station (Lingener Str./Emsstraße) on the right (north) bank of the Ems so as to temporarily maintain the connection from Quakenbrück to Rheine. After the Second World War, trains ran a different route between Oberhausen and Dorsten because of destroyed bridges, instead of running via Oberhausen West, Osterfeld Nord, Bottrop Nord and Kirchhellen (23. 2 km), all trains ran from Oberhausen Hbf via Bottrop Hbf, Gladbeck West and Feldhausen to Dorsten (28 km). Passenger services were restored only briefly between Osterfeld-Nord and Dorsten and finally closed in 1960. In the summer of 1950, for the first time after the war, one pair of services ran from Duisburg via Oberhausen, Rheine and Quakenbrück to Oldenburg until the abandonment of passenger services on the Rheine–Quakenbrück section on 31 May 1969. It subsequently ran between Duisburg and Rheine. It was operated from 1950 by class ET 487/488 diesel multiple units, in 1960 and in 1963/64 by E 829/830 carriages with locomotive-haulage, then again from 1966 with DB Class VT 24 diesel multiple units. Deutsche Bundesbahn operated a variety of equipment between Dorsten and Coesfeld, including class 515 battery railcars and class 624 DMUs. Current operations line to Essen-Frintrop, just after Osterfeld junction near Oberhausen Gasometer station Large sections of the line are now closed and largely dismantled and services only run on certain sections. Some sections are used for cycle paths or cycle paths are planned. Last trip on the Rheine- Coesfeld service in 1984 at Rheine station =Duisburg–Bottrop= The line is now considered part of the connection from Duisburg to Oberhausen–Osterfeld Süd and to Essen-Frintrop and is electrified and classified as a main line, while the section from Oberhausen-Osterfeld junction at the Oberhausen Gasometer to Bottrop Delog/Detag is a single-track and non-electrified branch line. At the gasometer the connecting curve to Osterfeld-Süd separates to run to the west of the gasometer with bridges over the Rhine-Herne Canal, the Emscher and autobahn 42. The line to Osterfeld-Nord and Bottrop-Nord separates to the east of the gasometer, also with bridges over the Rhine-Herne Canal, the Emscher, autobahn 42 and the single-track line to Osterfeld-Sud station. To the east of the gasometer, at Centro Oberhausen, the line to Essen-Frintrop separates and instead of crossing the canal runs towards the former Essen- Frintrop freight yard. The remaining line up to Bottrop Delog/Detag is now exclusively used for freight traffic to the Pilkington flat glass factory, formerly Delog (Deutsche Libbey-Owens Gesellschaft)/Detag (Deutsche Tafelglas AG), which is in the area of the city of Gladbeck. The single-track section between Duisburg station and Sigle junction is rarely used. = Dorsten–Coesfeld= The Dorsten–Coesfeld section is now part of Deutsche Bahn’s Münster-Ostwestfalen (East Westphalia) regional network, which has its headquarters in Münster. Operations are undertaken by NordWestBahn on behalf of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (transport association of the Rhine-Ruhr) and the Zweckverband Nahverkehr Westfalen-Lippe (local transport association of Westphalia-Lippe). Services on DB timetable route number 424 are operated as Regionalbahn service RB 45 under the marketing name of Der Coesfelder, mainly using Bombardier Talent diesel multiple units. Occasionally Alstom Coradia LINT 41 or Siemens Desiro Classic sets are used. On weekdays, trains meet every hour on the section in Maria Veen at 29 minutes past the hour. On weekends services run every two hours. For several years the local transport associations have discussed the possibility of abandoning services on the line. =Coesfeld–Rheine = On the section between Coesfeld and Rheine, passenger services were abandoned on 29 September 1984 and freight traffic ended on 1 January 1993. The direct route used by passenger services between Rheine and Hauenhorst was closed on 31 May 1986, while the slightly more curved line remained in service. Between 1994 to 1998 the whole line between Lutum and Rheine was closed in several stages. Between Coesfeld and Lutum, the Rheiner Gleis (“Rhenish track”) is now used by the Empel-Rees–Münster railway (Baumbergebahn), while its own track has been closed and dismantled. The dismantling of the section between Steinfurt and St. Arnold was finally completed on 30 September 2005. The first sod for the construction of the Munsterland cycling track was turned at St. Arnold station on 16 December 2008. This new cycle path which has been usable from Lutum to Rheine since the autumn of 2012, was officially opened on 5 May 2013. Between Coesfeld and Lutum, the cycle track is connected to the existing cycling network, as the Duisburg-Quakenbrück line continues to be used by the Empel-Rees–Münster line. =Rheine–Quakenbrück= Passenger traffic on this section was closed on 31 May 1969. Today, the relatively large signal boxes in Beesten and Fürstenau are still a reminder on the extensive train operations in the recent past. Prior to the total closure of the 23 km-long section between Rheine and Freren, the Rheine-Freren railway test facility was approved in 1979 to test the limits of the wheel-rail system at speeds up to 350 km/h, but construction was later cancelled. Freight traffic between Spelle and Quakenbrück was abandoned on 1 January 1996. This section was closed in 1997. Freight operations on the Rheine–Spelle section have been assumed by Regionalverkehr Münsterland (RVM). Traffic essentially consists of sand, gravel and materials for the manufacture of precast concrete destined for the Rekers cement works in Spelle (about 8,000 wagon loads per year) and agricultural machinery dispatched from Maschinenfabrik Bernard Krone in Spelle. The dismantling of the line between the former end of the line and the bypass has begun north of Spelle. The tracks have been removed near the former station at Beesten. Draisine rides are now offered between Fürstenau and Nortrup and between Nortrup and Quakenbrück. However, there is no continuous serviceable route between Fürstenau and Quakenbrück anymore.

The stately Gothic church contains elements of a Romanesque frieze, incorporated from an earlier church building on the same site. Görtlingbo Church lies within the Diocese of Visby. History Part of the Romanesque frieze made by Sigraf The earliest written record of the church is from 1296, when it is mentioned in a papal bull. Archaeological excavations carried out in 1956–1957 however show that there was a stone church here already in the 12th century. The finely carved reliefs that adorn the southern façade of the present church obviously come from this first, Romanesque church and have been incorporated in the later Gothic church that is visible today. The western tower was added in the 13th century, and a major reconstruction of the church into its present form was carried out during the late 14th century. The church has remained largely unaltered since, except for a few new furnishings. Asger Jorn is buried in the church cemetery. Architecture The church is large in comparison with other country churches on Gotland, and built of local sandstone. The nave is divided in three sections by sturdy columns. The choir lacks an apse and instead ends with three slender Gothic windows, a design typical for medieval churches on Gotland. The tower is Romanesque but the spire dates from the 18th century. The southern façade is adorned with elements of a Romanesque frieze, made by the artist commonly referred to as Sigraf and dating from circa 1200. They depict animals, both real and mystical, as well as fighting men and knights on horseback. Scholars are divided as to what they may depict. Some speculate that they may be an illustration of evil forces, pursuing humans. Others argue that they may be illustrating an ancient tale, perhaps that of Beowulf. Later and Gothic in style are the two carved portals on south side of the church. They date from the middle of the 14th century and the workshop has been identified as the notname Egypticus, which was active on Gotland during c. 1330-1380.Roosval, Johnny (1911) Die Kirchen Gotlands, ein Beitrag zur mittelalterlichen Kunstgeschichte Schwedens (Leipzig : E.A. Seeman) They depicts Christian scenes such as the Virgin Mary and the Resurrection. Typically for Egypticus the sculpted portals also include grinning, grotesque faces. Inside the church a few 14th century murals survive in the choir, depicting Christian scenes of the same type as the sculpted portals. The vaults in the nave also have some purely decorative paintings. Between the nave and the choir hangs a large triumphal cross, dating from the middle of the 13th century. The baptismal font is also a work by Sigraf and referred to as one of the finest examples of the sculptor's art. The pulpit dates from the Renaissance and was originally made for Visby Cathedral. It still displays the Danish coat of arms, rather than the Swedish.

He was also an attorney, a member of the Louisiana State Senate, a circuit court judge, a bank president, and a newspaper publisher. He is best known for his role in burying a Union Navy officer in Louisiana, an event now commemorated as \\"The Day the War Stopped\\". Early life and education Leake was born April 22, 1833 in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. He attended Kentucky Military Institute and Centenary College of Louisiana. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1857. He went into practice in St. Francisville, Louisiana. He became a Freemason in 1854, joining Feliciana Lodge No. 31.William Walter Leake, by Robert Leake, 2008 Civil War When war broke out in April 1861 Leake volunteered and was commissioned a captain. In September 1861 he was named captain of Company C of the First Louisiana Cavalry Regiment under Col. John Simms Scott. The regiment took part in various engagements, including the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, where they were part of the cavalry forces under General Nathan Bedford Forrest. After a poorly managed river crossing and other incidents, the regiment's officers questioned Scott's leadership, accusing him of incompetence and reckless endangerment of his men. In May 1862 nine company commanders went to General P. G. T. Beauregard's headquarters and resigned their commissions. Beauregard refused to accept their resignations and had them arrested for \\"abandoning their commands in the face of the enemy\\". They were later ordered to report back to the First Louisiana Cavalry. In October 1862 Leake again resigned his commission and returned home to St. Francisville, where he was commissioned a captain in the Third Battalion, State Guard, Louisiana Cavalry. He subsequently raised another company of cavalry that served as part of Cochrane's Brigade in the Army of Tennessee until the end of the war. Post-war career Following the war Leake returned to his law practice in St. Francisville. He served in the Louisiana State Senate from 1880 to 1882, and was a member of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention in 1882. From 1896 to 1904 he served as a circuit court judge. From 1906 until his death in 1912 he served as president of the People's Bank in St. Francisville. Leake and his wife May founded the local newspaper, the True Democrat (now the St. Francisville Democrat), in 1892. \\"The day the war stopped\\" In June 1863, while Leake was home on furlough, a Union navy commander who was part of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on the Mississippi River near St. Francisville died on board his ship. (Decades later a story developed that the ship had been shelling St. Francisville, but no such record can be found in the ship's log, and the historic shelling of St. Francisville actually took place in January 1864.) The officer, John E. Hart, was a Mason, and his second officer went ashore under flag of truce to ask if there were any Masons in the area who would conduct a funeral. He was directed to Leake, who was then senior warden in the St. Francisville Masonic lodge. Leake made arrangements for Hart to be buried at Grace Episcopal Church there. A truce was arranged so that the Union officers could bring his body ashore, attend the funeral, and return to their ship to resume their blockade. A joint party of Union and Confederate officers, all Masons, participated in the funeral on June 12, 1863. The pastor of Grace Church, Rev. Daniel S. Lewis, conducted an Episcopal service, and Leake as acting master of the lodge led the Masonic service. For the rest of his life Leake, who later became Master of the lodge, tended Hart's grave and decorated it with flowers. Leake was buried near Hart, and the two former enemies (who never met in life) are commemorated with a single marble slab, placed in 1955 by the Grand Lodge of the state of Louisiana and \\"dedicated to the universality of Freemasonry.\\" Since 1999 there has been an annual commemoration and re-enactment of the incident, sponsored jointly by the St. Francisville Masonic lodge and Hart's home lodge in Schenectady, New York, and attended by descendants of both men. During the re- enactment, members of the St. Francisville lodge portray Leake; past portrayers have included a U.S. Congressman and Leake's great-great-grandson. Personal He married Margaret Mumford on December 10, 1857. They had eleven children. He died January 20, 1912, and was buried in the Grace Episcopal Church cemetery, not far from Hart.

He is very well known in India and Pakistan for his tragic love story with Zainab, a Muslim girl he rescued during the communal riots in the time of partition of India in 1947. Both fell in love and got married. Later, being a Muslim, Zainab is deported and sent to the newly born Pakistan. Boota illegally enters Pakistan and when the girl backed off under the pressure from her family, he commits suicide by jumping before an upcoming train near Shahdara station in Pakistan along with his daughter but she survived but some people tell another story about this incident. According to them, they did not go to Pakistan, they went towards Bengal and both were killed due to illness. The love story of Singh's life is widely adapted in films and books on both sides of the border. A Punjabi film Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh (1999) is entirely based on the story. Ishrat Rahmani wrote a novel, Muhabbat, based on the story. The story also influenced many other films including a 2007 Canadian film Partition and a 2001 Bollywood film Gadar and the 2004 Bollywood film Veer Zaara. Burial In his suicide note, Singh expressed his last wish to be buried in Barki village where Zainab's parents resettled after partition. The autopsy of Singh's body was conducted in a hospital in Lahore and was taken to the village on 22 February 1957 for burial but the villagers did not allow that and Singh was buried at Miani Sahib, the largest graveyard of Lahore. In popular culture In 1999, Manoj Punj directed a Punjabi feature film, Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh, entirely based on the life story of Boota Singh. The movie stars Gurdas Maan as Boota Singh and Divya Dutta as Zainab. The music was composed by Amar Haldipur. It was an international hit and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Punjabi at the 46th National Film Awards and was also screened at many national and international film festivals including the 1999 Vancouver International Film Festival and International Film Festival of India.

It was created in 1999 as an engineering research and exhibit competition for students in grades 5 through 8 and was sponsored primarily by Discovery Communications, Society for Science and the Public, and Elmer's Glue. Competitors originally qualified for DCYSC by entering in an International Science and Engineering affiliated science fair and nominated by a teacher or professional (also see Intel International Science and Engineering Fair). The judging criteria challenged students to complete an application that included several essays. The essays were then evaluated for communication abilities by DCYSC judges who selected 400 semi- finalists. The judging panel also selected 40 finalists who received an all- expense-paid trip to Washington D.C. to compete in the final competition. The finals were composed of two parts. The first was a research presentation, accounting for 20% of the total score, held at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, the National Academy of Sciences, or another academic national association that varied from year to year. The second part was a series of six science-related challenges that took place at the National Institutes of Health or the University of Maryland. Each challenge was concluded with some type of presentation (e.g., a radio show, a TV show, or a news conference) worth 10% of the students' total score. Students also presented a simple science experiment, known as a Whelmer, in front of cameras for 15% of their score. The remaining 5% came from teamwork, as the finalists were split into eight colored teams consisting of five members each for the science challenges. The contest's name change to the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge occurred in 2008. Students no longer have to be nominated and now submit a 1-2 minute video clip as their form of entry.

Formerly a member of anti-Shia militant group Sipah-e-Sahaba, Ishaq co-founded the LeJ in 1996. Under Ishaq's leadership, the LeJ claimed responsibility for several mass-casualty attacks largely targeting Pakistan's Shia and Barelvi population, including multiple bombings that killed over 200 Hazara Shias in Quetta in 2013. He was also accused of masterminding the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore in 2009, and the Ashura bombings in Afghanistan in 2011. Ishaq was killed, along with his two sons and deputy Ghulam Rasool Shah, in a police encounter on 29 July 2015, the circumstances of which are disputed. Punjab Home Minister Shuja Khanzada was assassinated in Attock a month later, in an attack claimed by LeJ as retaliation. Ishaq was described by various news agencies as Pakistan's most feared terror kingpin. Early life Malik Ishaq was born to a poor family in Taranda Sawaey Khan in Rahim Yar Khan District of Punjab, Pakistan. His father was a cloth merchant. Educated until sixth class, Ishaq spent three years working at his father's shop until 1984, when he began working as a cigarette vendor according to police records. Sipah-e-Sahaba member Ishaq came under the influence of Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, the founder of anti-Shia militant group Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), in the 1980s. The SSP claimed to be countering the Iranian Revolution and the Pakistan-based pro- Iranian Shia activist group Tehreek Nifaz-e-Fiqh Jafariya Pakistan. Ishaq became an active participant in the SSP's activities, and was jailed for the first time for acts of hate speech during Muharram in 1989. Lashkar-e- Jhangvi co-founder and leader In 1996, Ishaq, along with Riaz Basra and Akram Lahori, co-founded LeJ, a violent splinter group of the original SSP.Article published by The Nation Retrieved 2015-07-29 He confessed his involvement in the killing of 102 Shias to an Urdu newspaper in October 1997, before being rearrested. He assumed senior leadership of LeJ from jail after Basra was killed in a police encounter in 2002. Forging ties with al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban following the 9/11 attacks, Ishaq was charged with more than 100 murders and 45 criminal cases, including masterminding the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore in 2009. He was never convicted, owing to weak evidence and intimidation of judges and witnesses. =Release and possible deal= Ishaq was released on bail after 14 years in July 2011, amid speculation of a deal and growing ties with the Pakistan Muslim League (N), the ruling party in Punjab. He was showered with rose petals by supporters, and received by Tahir Ashrafi and SSP president Ahmad Ludhianvi. The province's Law Minister Rana Sanaullah denied there was any deal behind Ishaq's release, but said extremist leaders were free to join politics if they eschewed violence. Sanaullah said of the occasion, \\"We are in touch with those who have become, or want to become, useful citizens.\\" Soon after his release, The Associated Press reported Ishaq again making public speeches against the Shia community and threatening his opponents on 4 September 2011, saying \\"We know how to kill and how to die.\\" Ishaq was appointed Vice-President of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat, the renamed SSP, in 2012. =Ashura bombings in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif= On 6 December 2011, a suicide bomber attacked the Abu Fazl Mosque in the Murad Khane neighbourhood of Kabul, claiming more than 50 lives. The second bomb took place near the Blue Mosque in the northern city of Mazar- e-Sharif, where four people were killed. Ishaq's LeJ claimed responsibility. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said he would discuss the matter with Pakistan.Karzai Says He Will Talk to Pakistan Over Attacks. The News York Times. 7 December 2011. =Quetta bombings= Ishaq was rearrested after the LeJ claimed responsibility for multiple bombings that killed over 200 Hazara Shias in Quetta in January and February, 2013. Taken together, the bombings were the deadliest attack against any minority in the history of Pakistan. Death and aftermath Malik Ishaq was killed in Muzaffargarh, Punjab, in a police encounter with the Counter Terrorism Department of the Punjab Police on the morning of 29 July 2015, along with his two sons, Usman and Haq Nawaz. Also killed among Ishaq's entourage were 11 others, including his deputy and purported LeJ second-in-command Syed Ghulam Rasool Shah, as well as Shah's two sons. According to the police, Ishaq and his associates were being shifted from Multan to Muzaffargarh to locate an illegal weapons storage site, when a group of armed supporters attacked the police convoy in an attempt to free Ishaq.AFP - news published by Sky News [Retrieved 2015-07-29] This was disputed by local and international news agencies including The Economist, which stated, \\"The police have barely bothered to pretend the incident was anything other than a mass extra-judicial killing.\\" =Assassination of Home Minister Shuja Khanzada= On 16 August 2015, the home office of Punjab Home Minister Shuja Khanzada, located in Shadikhan, Attock, was attacked by two suicide bombers, killing Khanzada and 18 others. Preliminary reports prepared by Pakistani law enforcement agencies suggested Khanzada was attacked in retaliation for the killing of Malik Ishaq. The LeJ claimed responsibility for the attack, confirming it was for Ishaq's killing in July.

In 1946 she started at Brooklyn College as a professor of philosophy until 1951. From 1955 until 1965, Lavine held a faculty position at the University of Maryland. In 1965 Lavine went to George Washington University to become Elton Professor of Philosophy, where she taught for 20 years. In 1985, Lavine became a Robinson Professor of Philosophy at George Mason University, and remained at George Mason until her retirement in 1998. Lavine received the “Outstanding Faculty Member” award while at the University of Maryland and the “Outstanding Professor” award during her time at George Washington University.  Writing and lectures  Lavine's writing and lectures concern a variety of topics including, “the ideas of the Founding Fathers, Judaic thought, women’s studies, and biomedical ethics.John Shook, “Lavine, Thelma Zeno (1915-),” in ' 'The Dictionary of Modern Philosophers' ', vol. 1 (Bristol: THoemmes Contiuum, 2005), 1422.” Some of her areas of specialty include 19th and 20th century continental philosophy, interpretation theory, and sociology of knowledge, American philosophy, and American culture. Despite her variety of interests, American philosophy became her major area of inquiry, especially pragmatism and the writing of John Dewey, and also Charles S. Peirce, C.I. Lewis, Morris R. Cohen, John H. Randall, Jr., and John McDermott. Lavine is an internationally known writer, and she has been published abroad in several countries, including Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. One of Levine's earliest essays, “Naturalism and the Sociological Analysis of Knowledge,” was included in Naturalism and the Human Spirit (1944), by Yervant H. Krikorian. The book also included essays by other noteworthy American philosophers such as John Dewey, and Sidney Hook. In the article, Lavine conveys her attitude towards Dewey's philosophy and identifies him as the, “vanguard of twentieth- century naturalism.”Thelma Lavine, “What is the Method of Naturalism,” in ' 'The Philosophy Journal' ', vol. 50, no. 5, Feb. 15, 1953, 157. “What is the Method of Naturalism?,” is an article written by Lavine that was published in the February 1953 edition of the Journal of Philosophy. This article examines “naturalistic philosophy’s cultivation through the creation of relations between philosophic inquiry and other areas of study.Thelma Lavine, “What is the Method of Naturalism,” in The Philosophy Journal, vol. 50, no. 5, Feb. 15, 1953, 157. In addition to her work on the topic of Naturalism, Lavine also wrote about the historical development of Western philosophy. She is well known for the televised lecture series ' 'From Socrates to Sartre, A Historical Introduction to Philosophy' ', put on by the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting in 1979. The series comprised thirty lectures, and it has been praised for making philosophy accessible to the public. Lavine’s most famous publication—' 'From Socrates to Sartre, The Philosophic Quest' '(1984) grew out of the televised lectures, over 250,000 copies were published in the United States and it was also translated into Japanese.John Shook, “Lavine, Thelma Zeno (1915-),” in The Dictionary of Modern Philosophers, vol. 1 (Bristol: THoemmes Contiuum, 2005), 1422 Another notable publication of Lavine’s is the essay, “The Contemporary Significance of the American Philosophic Tradition: Lockean and Redemptive,” from ' 'Reading Dewey' ', Interpretations for a Postmodern Generation (1998), by Larry A. Hickman. In the essay, Lavine articulates the progression of philosophic thought beginning with an evaluation of Enlightenment principles and their role in the development of the national and legal identity of the United States. She then explains the correlation of Lockean Enlightenment ideas and American modernity conflicts with Dewey's mode of redemption. Lavine explains Dewey as being the, “most sensitive…to the countercurrents of modernity and the challenge of their unification, which would lead to realizing the goal of redemption,” Lavine holds that the, “contemporary significance of the American philosophic tradition is that among all remaining philosophies of the West, only American pragmatism addresses and seeks to theorize the contestations of modernity.Thelma Lavine, “The Contemporary Significance of the American Philosophic Tradition: Lockean and Redemptive,” in ' 'Reading Dewey' ', ed. Larry Hickman (Bloomington: IU Press, 1998), 223-224. Lavine was one of the earliest American philosophers to develop the perspective on the Hermeneutic (interpretive) turn in contemporary philosophy with her early studies \\"Knowledge as Interpretation\\" published in 1950.Thelma Lavine \\"Knowledge as Interpretation: An Historical Survey\\", Parts 1 & 2, in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. X. No. 4, and Vol. XI, No. 1. These essays were reworked in an extensive study with Victorino Tejera in the volume History and Anti-History in Philosophy.\\"The Interpretive Turn from Kant to Derrida: A Critique\\", Lavine, T.Z. and Tejera, V (Eds.) History and Anti-History in Philosophy. Nijhoff International Philosophy Series Volume 34, by Kluwer Academic Publishers. 1989, pp. 32-121. Lavine's original contribution to American Philosophical Naturalism was advanced in her article \\"Modernity and the Spirit of Naturalism\\" delivered to the APA Central division in 1991. She outlined the three main components of the Naturalistic paradigm consisting of 1) The Continuity of Analysis Paradigm, 2) The Problematic Situation Paradigm, and 3) The Critique of Modernity Paradigm. This third and last paradigm is espoused by Lavine as the new model paradigm which both incorporates the earlier paradigms to interpret and appropriate the conflicting frameworks of Modernity, and \\"re-open the blocked path of naturalistic pragmatism\\". Her commitment to Naturalism was perennial.Thelma Lavine, Romanell Lecture on Philosophical Naturalism, in Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association Vol. 65, No. 3 (Nov., 1991), 73-83  Organizations  Throughout her career as professor, Lavine was also a member of several organizations in the field of Philosophy. She was a founding member of SOPHIA (Society of Philosophers in America), the Cosmos Club in Washington, and the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy (SAAP). She was honored by the SAAP in 2000 with the Herbert W. Schneider Award for her contributions to the understanding and development of American philosophy.John Shook, “Lavine, Thelma Zeno (1915-),” in The Dictionary of Modern Philosophers, vol. 1 (Bristol: THoemmes Contiuum, 2005), 1422.

W. Carleton graduated among the Class of 1904 with a degree of civil engineer from the School of Applied Science. After graduating, Carleton served as the lifetime Class President of the Class of 1904; Chairman of the Columbia University Engineering Center Fund Committee, the committee responsible for raising the funds to build engineering and science buildings on the Northeast corner of Columbia University's Morningside Campus; President of the Columbia Engineering Council; and a member of The Society of Older Graduates of Columbia. Carleton also co-founded The Carleton Company, Inc. in the 1920s. The engineering firm that took part in the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Long Island Railroad, the New York City Subway that ran under Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, and the Holland Tunnel. Carleton was lauded for his ability to work on these transportation hubs without interrupting regular service. In 1941 Carleton negotiated with the United States Government so that The Carleton Company Inc. could build the largest receiving and distributing centers to support war efforts by facilitating the transfer of materials during the Second World War. Bronze plaque located at the entrance of the laboratory, officially dedicating the space as the Robert A. W. Carleton Strength of Materials Laboratory. Robert Carleton was appointed the head of the Engineering Center Development Fund Committee, which oversaw the fundraising and design of what would become the Seeley Wintersmith Mudd and the Engineering Terrace buildings. Under his leadership, construction of the facility was completed in six months. On 4 April 1959, Carleton was awarded the Egleston Medal, Columbia University’s highest award for distinguished engineering achievement due to the breadth of engineering work undertaken during his career. In 1962, the Trustees of the University authorized the establishment of the Robert A. W. Carleton Strength of Materials Laboratory in the department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, due to the support of Robert A. W. (1881–1971) and his wife Christine S. Carleton (1905–1983). Eight years later, the Columbia Engineering Alumni Association commissioned a portrait of Carleton, painted by artist Lester Bentley. The painting was dedicated and given a place inside the Monnell Engineering Library in the Seeley W. Mudd Building in December 1970. This painting has since been moved into Carleton Lab and placed at the top of the staircase on the main floor. Robert A. W. Carleton died in 1971, but his wife continued to support Carleton Lab and Columbia Engineering in her husband’s name until her death in 1983. = Directors of Research = * William G.

In 1962 Wyche and other plaintiffs won a civil suit against the local registrar and state government, and were able to register to vote. He encouraged other blacks in town to register. Beginning in 1969, and following passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Wyche was elected to the local office of police chief of the city; he was reelected and served eleven years. In 1986 he was elected as mayor of Tallulah, serving one term until 1990. After decades as a grassroots organizer, Wyche began to receive national attention for his work to dismantle racial segregation. In January 1970, six months after he was elected as Tallulah police chief, Ebony Magazine featured him in the article, \\"Black Lawman in KKK Territory.\\" This was a reference to the Tallulah branch of the Ku Klux Klan, whose numerous local chapters fought desegregation in the American South. Until Wyche became police chief, he had earned his living as a barber. Early life and education Wyche was born in 1918 and raised in Tallulah, Louisiana, where he attended segregated schools. Both the city and parish were majority black, the center of an agricultural area, but African Americans were largely disfranchised for decades into the mid-20th century, as they were throughout most of the Jim Crow South. Wyche studied and became a barber, which could offer a decent living. When he was in his 20s, he enlisted in the US Army and served during World War II. Even before he served in the war, Wyche began to work for African-American civil rights. Since 1942, Wyche had chaired the group \\"Equal Rights for Black People\\". (This organization may have originally used the word \\"Colored\\" or \\"Negro\\" originally because the term \\"black\\" was not widely used until after 1970.) Political activism and career After returning as a veteran of World War II, Wyche and other African-American men did not want to accept Jim Crow conditions in Louisiana and increased their activism for civil rights. In 1947 he joined seven other black men in filing a lawsuit against the Madison Parish registrar of voters and Governor Jimmie Davis to enforce the right of blacks to vote, as guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The state had raised barriers to voter registration in its constitution of 1898, through such devices as poll taxes and subjective literacy tests administered by white registrars. Decades into the 20th century, most African Americans in Louisiana were excluded from the political system Wyche and the plaintiffs prevailed in the lawsuit in 1962, and the court ordered that they be allowed to register. He became one of the first African Americans since Reconstruction in Tallulah to register to vote and subsequently run for office in the city.Madison Journal, September 29, 1999 He also worked to get other African Americans registered. In his barbershop, Wyche often spoke of his interest in law enforcement and such television series as Highway Patrol, starring Broderick Crawford, Dragnet with Jack Webb, and Perry Mason, starring Raymond Burr. In 1965, following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Wyche led demonstrations in the city to promote school integration, job opportunities for blacks, and support of government anti-poverty programs. He was arrested six times. In 1966, he received a four- month sentence for assaulting a white man, Dr. John Monsell, at Bill's Highway 80 Truck Stop. Appeal of the Monsell case was still in litigation after Wyche became police chief. Wyche served thirty-four days of the four-month sentence, during which he picked 250 pounds of cotton in a parish penal unit. In 1966, Wyche ran for a seat as alderman, but failed by 111 votes. Two years later, on February 6, 1968, Wyche ran as the Democratic nominee for Police Chief, formerly the village marshal. He lost by 196 votes to white Republican Clayton W. Cox. Wyche had urged his supporters to vote straight Democrat, but the police chief contest was a special election. That office was severed from the rest of the Democratic nominees on the ballot. Most of the Democrats ran unopposed. The only statewide contest was for state treasurer between Democrat Mary Evelyn Parker and Republican Allison Kolb.Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, February 6, 1968 When voters marked the straight Democratic ticket with a single lever of the voting machine, several hundred Wyche supporters thought they had cast a vote for Wyche. When he and his supporters found out about the peculiarity of the ballot and the \\"missing\\" votes, Wyche successfully sued for another election. A federal judge ruled that the way the ballots had been set up for the special election was discriminatory. Wyche won the next special election for Police Chief and took office on June 26, 1969. The police force already had four black and six white officers; after two of the latter left, he replaced them, and hired two more black officers. He would send them out in teams. In his first months in office, Wyche held what he called \\"sensitivity sessions\\", inviting the public to meet his officers and trying to improve relations with the community. He noted that blacks had often been harassed by police. Wyche also reached out to white businesses to assure them he would offer crime protection. Seventeen businesses had closed in 1965 rather than hire blacks, when African Americans conducted a boycott against them. That year Wyche was among numerous civil rights leaders in the South interviewed by Stanford University for an oral history project. Because of historic under-representation of black voters in Tallulah and Madison Parish in most of the 20th century, the white minority in the city, 32 percent in 1970 (and in the parish) was considered the \\"majority\\" for purposes of enforcement of civil rights legislation. That is, until the parish established a record of representative voter registration, the federal government had oversight of its processes. At first Wyche was unable to obtain much support from whites. In time whites slowly made peace with the emerging majority of black voters, following the lead of veteran mayor William Putnam Sevier, who served from 1946 to 1974. He was a descendant of the early Tennessee pioneer John Sevier, and a member of a strong political family in Tallulah and Madison Parish, whose members also served at state and national levels. Time in 1970 described Sheriff Wyche by the following: > ... the massive, 6-ft. 2-in. figure swaggers down the sidewalk. There is the > natty uniform with gold stars on a white starched shirt, a button open at > the neck. And there is the amiable cockiness, the touch of braggadocio, the > blunt cigar and the smile revealing two gold-crowned teeth. Only one anomaly > destroys the stereotype: Chief Wyche is black. Wyche was reelected twice in regular elections, and served in total for more than two terms as chief, until June 30, 1978. He was succeeded by Howard Claxton, Sr.Confirmed by the police chief's office in Tallulah Wyche also served as chairman of the Black Caucus for Louisiana's 5th congressional district. This district was long represented by Otto Passman (D) (1947-1977), a white conservative who was first elected in the years of disenfranchisement of blacks and was a critic of civil rights legislation. Passman was defeated in the 1976 Democratic primary by Jerry Huckaby. (The 5th district was redrawn in 2013 following reapportionment after the 2010 census.) In 1972, Wyche was elected as a chairman of the Louisiana delegation to the Democratic National Convention, which met in Miami Beach, Florida, and nominated the McGovern- Shriver ticket. Newly elected Governor Edwin Edwards (D) attended the convention. After he refused to back party nominee George McGovern, Edwards was snubbed by the Louisiana delegation. Leon Irwin, III (1936-2006), a former Democratic National Committeeman from New Orleans, attributed the snub to Wyche, and said that he was one who \\"knows a great deal about politics but has very bad manners.\\"\\"Governor Edwards Left Convention Because He Was Rudely Treated,\\" Minden Press-Herald, July 12, 1972, p. 12. Edwards was unhappy with the McGovern nomination; he predicted that incumbent President Richard M. Nixon [a Republican] would win the electoral vote of Louisiana.\\"Edwards Predicts Nixon Will Carry Louisiana in the Fall Election,\\" Minden Press- Herald, July 13, 1972, p. 1. In keeping with the increasing shift of white Democrats to Republican candidates, Nixon carried much of the South in 1972. In 1978, Wyche was a dinner guest of U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Blair House in Washington, D.C. In 1986, Wyche was elected mayor; he defeated the Republican candidate, William Ellis Buckner (born c. 1929), 1,891 votes (55.4 percent) to 1,525 (44.6 percent). Two other African-American candidates were eliminated in the nonpartisan blanket primary: incumbent Democratic Mayor Leander A. \\"Doc\\" Anthony, who finished in a strong third-place showing; and Adell Williams, Tallulah's first African-American mayor, elected in 1974. In the 1986 election Republican candidates won two of the five city council seats. One, Charles Michael Finlayson (born c. 1956), has been repeatedly re- elected to the District 1 seat. Madison Parish Wyche was defeated for a second term as mayor in the primary election held on April 7, 1990, by Donald E. Walker, who finished with 54.4 percent of the ballots cast. Other candidates were former mayor Adell Williams, and Republican Donna Cummins, who polled 3.9 percent of the vote. Personal life and death Wyche was the chairman of the board of the Madison Parish Hospital and president of Delta Community Action Agency. He organized Tallulah's first troop of the Boy Scouts of America. He was an associate in the construction of three apartment complexes, one of which bears his name. Wyche was a member of the Masonic lodge, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and the deacon board of the Greater Mt. Olive Baptist Church at 316 North Walnut Street in Tallulah. Wyche and his wife, the former Myrtle Washington, had two children, Elois Wyche, of Decatur, Georgia, a retired funeral director, and Dr. Ronald Charles Wyche, currently living in Tallulah. Zelma C. Wyche died on September 24, 1999 and was known as \\"Mr. Civil Rights of Louisiana.\\" He is interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Tallulah.

In 1984 he ran successfully for Chief of the Millbrook Band at a time when the band was $4 million in debt.\\"Longserving chief ready for a final term Paul says\\", Truro Daily News, February 20, 2012 Within 2 years, the debt had been eliminated and a new program of economic development had begun. Paul had determined that the success of the band would be based on its inherent strengths and by working within the prevailing economic and governing structures of the day. Notably, in 2009, he brought the Band onto the board of the regional economic development group, CORDA. In the early 2000s, under his leadership the Band obtained a federal grant and provincial support to build a highway interchange that connected the Millbrook Reserve to Nova Scotia Highway 102, thus opening up the potential of the site for further economic development. The Truro Power Centre was built beside the interchange and the Band now leases the site to aboriginal and non-aboriginal tenants including Tim Horton, A&W;, a Super 8 Motel, and Sobeys/Empire (Studio 7 Cinema). An onshore aquaculture facility that raises Arctic Char is also located on the site as a Band-owned operation. A new housing development was also created nearby. On other Band-owned sites in Nova Scotia, Millbrook First Nation also made significant band and partnered investments under his tenure as Chief, including a new building to house a General Dynamics helicopter support facility on its Cole Harbour Reserve, a wind energy project, and a planned deep-water port in Melford, Nova Scotia. At Sheet Harbour and Joggins, it has developed wharf facilities and maintains small fishing fleets.

She co-founded the Cipta Cakra Murdaya (CCM) group of companies, which is involved in real estate, IT, timber, plantations, consumer goods and engineering. The company's real estate assets include shopping centers, office buildings, hotels and the Jakarta International Expo Center. Hartati was in 2013 sentenced to 32 months in jail for paying bribes to obtain permits for her oil palm plantation companies.  Early life, education, family  Hartati grew up in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, the eldest of seven children in a devout Buddhist family. Her father, Tjakra Bhudi, was a former journalist. She studied economics at Trisakti University, and worked in her father's sawmill company as general manager after graduation. In 1971, the 25-year-old Hartati met a young entrepreneur, Murdaya Widyawimarta Poo (also known as Poo Tjie Goan), and they married in 1972. A year later, Hartati left her father's company to assist her husband in building his business. In 1984, Hartati attended an executive program for graduate students at Stanford University in California, as well as a program in management for smaller companies at the National University of Singapore in 1985. Hartati's four children were educated in the US from a young age and reside in San Francisco, New York, and Jakarta.  Business  In the early 1970s, Hartati and her husband founded PT CCM, which focused on the electricity and construction sectors. Regarded as cronies of authoritarian president Suharto, the couple made their fortunes through lucrative procurement contracts for state electricity company PLN. They were also close to the Indonesian military. As their business grew, Hartati and her husband went on to cooperate with some of the world's largest power companies, such as Fuji Electric of Japan and Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) of Switzerland. CCM also won a license for the production of Nike shoes in Indonesia, and marketed the products of some of the world's top technology firms, such as IBM, HP, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Symantec. As of 2013, the group employed about 45,000 people across various industries ranging from property to retail to agribusiness. In 2012, Hartati was listed by Forbes as one of Asia's 50 Power Businesswomen. She did not make the list in 2016. In 2018, Hartati and her husband ranked 32nd on Globe Asia's list of 150 richest Indonesians, with wealth of $1.4 billion. Also in 2018, Murdaya Poo was ranked 22nd on Forbes Media's list of Indonesia's 50 Richest. Hartati's personal website lists CCM's business partners in the following sectors: * Heavy industries and contracting: ABB, Balfour Beatty, Azbil, Carrier, Hitachi, Schindler, and Mitsubishi. * Natural resources: Buyers of CCM's forestry, wood manufacturing, and palm oil plantations in Central Sulawesi and East Kalimantan are located in Japan, the US and Europe. * Fashion retail and marketing: ColeHaan (Singapore), And1 (Indonesia) and Nike. * Information technology: Hewlett Packard. * Property: Metropolitan Kentjana and Hong Kong Land. Buddhist leader In 1992, Hartati was appointed chairwoman of a Buddhist umbrella group called Leadership of Indonesian Buddhists (Perwalian Umat Buddha Indonesia, Walubi). This was the only national Buddhist organization recognized by the government during the Suharto regime and it helped to mobilize support among ethnic Chinese for Suharto's political vehicle, Golkar. Following the fall of Suharto in May 1998, a schism between the country's Buddhist groups prompted a challenge to Hartati's leadership of Walubi. This led to Walubi being dissolved in November 1998. Hartati quickly responded in December 1998 by founding the Representatives of the Indonesian Buddhist Community (Perwakilan Umat Buddha Indonesia, also called Walubi), which she has led since its inception. The organization aims to cultivate greater communication and cooperation between its components, and to promote Buddhism in Indonesia. Its components include Lembaga Keagamaan Buddha, Dewan Sangha, Badan Kehormatan and Wadah Kemasyarakatanin. One of Walubi's tenets is commitment to community service, along with having an open mind to other faiths and beliefs. Philanthropy Under Hartati's leadership, Walubi is involved in post-disaster relief work, as well as missions where medical staff of different faiths volunteer to provide free treatment, such as cataract removals, cleft-palate corrections in children, tumor removals and dental care, to thousands of patients. Hartati organizes and participates in many of these missions herself. After the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, which killed over 400 people and left over 14,000 homeless, Hartati was involved in the provision of relief aid. In November 2018, Hartati paid Rp120 million for a painting of Muslim leader and vice presidential candidate Ma'ruf Amin at a charity auction to raise funds for victims of the 2018 earthquake and tsunami in Palu and Donggala, Central Sulawesi. Corruption Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) arrested Hartati on 12 September 2012 on suspicion of bribery. She subsequently resigned from the Democratic Party's board of patrons and the National Economic Committee. On 4 February 2013, Hartati was sentenced to 32 months in prison and fined Rp150 million ($15,000) after a court found her guilty of bribery. The penalty was less than the five- year sentence and Rp250 million fine recommended by the KPK. Hartati had paid Rp3 billion ($309,000) in bribes to Amran Batalipu, the former regent of Buol in Central Sulawesi, in exchange for land concessions for her oil palm plantation companies, PT Hartati Inti Plantation and PT Cipta Cakra Murdaya. Hartati was released on parole on 23 July 2014, after serving two-thirds of her sentence. Her parole was granted by justice minister Amir Syamsuddin, who served with Hartati on the Democratic Party’s board of advisers. Law observers criticized Hartati's early release, saying it undermined the government's efforts to combat corruption. Indonesia Corruption Watch said the parole was legally flawed because Hartati had not fulfilled all necessary requirements. KPK confirmed Hartati had not qualified for parole, denying it had recommended to the Justice Ministry that she be recognized as a \\"justice collaborator\\". The Buol Farmers Forum also condemned the parole, saying Hartati's company had used military and police force to seize their traditional farmland, which was subsequently converted to oil palm plantations. They said the company's actions had caused ecological disasters and also led to conflict between farmers and oil palm plantation workers. Prior to her arrest, Hartati denied any wrongdoing and claimed she could not lie because she is a religious person. During her trial, she claimed the money given to the regent was not a bribe but was a donation for his election campaign. Land grab accusation and palm oil criticism Environmental groups and farmers have accused Hartati's CCM of using military force and paying bribes to take control of customary land and forests in Buol district. The bribery allegations were later proved in court. The land takeover operation commenced in 1994, when workers guarded by soldiers began chopping down forests to clear land for a 22,000 hectare oil palm plantation. Farmlands and forests used by over 6,500 families were destroyed. Plantation workers have complained that low wages keep them poor and in debt. Hartati's website states that her companies in many instances \\"improve and economically develop the land, enabling other local residents to improve their living conditions\\". A 2018 report by Greenpeace put CCM on a list of \\"dirty producers\\" of palm oil. The report said neither CCM nor its Hardaya Plantations Group (HPG) is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and neither has a public \\"no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation\\" (NDPE) policy. It also said neither CCM nor HPG makes maps of its concession boundaries publicly available in a usable format. In response to the Greenpeace findings, Mars said actions had been taken to exclude the group from its supply chain. Politics During the Suharto regime, Hartati used her position in the original Walubi Buddhist organization to channel support from Chinese-Indonesians to Suharto's political vehicle, Golkar. After the fall of Suharto, Hartati's husband, Murdaya Widyawimatra Poo, joined the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) of Megawati Sukarnoputri, who served as president from 2001 to 2004. Murdaya became a treasurer and financial supporter of PDIP. He was elected to national parliament in the 2004 and 2009 general elections. Hartati meanwhile joined the Democratic Party of Megawati's rival, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who served as president from 2004 to 2014. She resigned from the party after being arrested for corruption in 2012. Earlier, her husband was dismissed from PDIP for allegedly channeling his support to Yudhoyono in the 2009 presidential election. After a meeting with vice presidential candidate and Muslim leader Ma'ruf Amin in November 2018, Hartati denied her visit was a form of endorsement ahead of the 2019 presidential election. She said the meeting discussed how to maintain inter- religious harmony during the election year.

It was acquired by Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1932. Later it was nationalized. Ownership Edward L. Doheny, who owned the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Co., controlled the Barco concession in Colombia through a subsidiary. He became interested in Venezuelan oil operations, including a pipeline from Colombia to Venezuela to reduce the cost of exporting the Colombian oil. After meetings between J.A. Coronil and Doheney's staff, the Lago Petroleum Co. was formed by Preston McGoodwin, Joshua S. Cosden and Payne Whitney Associates, and registered in Delaware on 12 April 1923. British- Mexican Petroleum acquired about 25% of its stock. In 1924 the company took over concessions that had been granted to the British Equatorial Oil Company in addition to properties it had purchased from twenty Venezuelans who had obtained them from General Juan Vicente Gómez, the military ruler of the country. C. Ledyard Blair's Blair & Co. and Chase Securities sold a controlling stake in Lago to Pan American Petroleum in a complex transaction at the end of 1925. By the late 1920s a trio of foreign-controlled companies were operating in the eastern Lake Maracaibo region. Shell Oil had the Aranguren concession onshore. Gulf Oil had acquired the Creole Syndicate's leases in the strip of shallow water wide along the lake shore. Standard of Indiana through Pan American owned Lago's operations in the lake bed. In 1932 Pan American sold its foreign properties to Standard Oil of New Jersey for about $100 million. The deal included Pan American's large oil concessions in Venezuela. Lago Petroleum became a subsidiary of Creole Petroleum Corporation, now the Venezuelan subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey. Included in the sale were the Lago Oil and Transport Company and the Lago Shipping Company, and the finalized plans to build the Lago refinery, \\"the giant\\", on Aruba. It later operated under the name Creole Petroleum Company, then under Standard Oil's name, Esso. The company was nationalized with the rest of the Venezuelan petroleum industry in 1976. Operations Lago owned about of land in Lake Maracaibo, and produced about 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Oil wells in Lake Maracaibo require drilling platforms. Wooden pilings to support the platforms were vulnerable to teredo worms. Lago Petroleum pioneered use of concrete pilings pre-fitted with steel heads and tied together with steel ropes. Lago's techniques, including use of barges to move heavy equipment around, made the cost of drilling on water lower than that of drilling on land, although taxes and royalties had been set lower by the government on the assumption that costs would be higher. The company did not spend money on exploration, but simply drilled wells into the La Rosa field. Lago discovered the valuable Tía Juana field in 1928. Standard of Indiana obtained land on Aruba from the Dutch government, built a tanker terminal and refinery there, and started shipping Lago's crude to Aruba in 1925. In 1929 Lago had 129 active wells in the lake. In 1929 nineteen lake tankers carried 37 million barrels of crude to the huge refinery being built at the Aruba terminal. Production was inefficient. Since the three competing companies were draining a common reservoir, each had an interest in extracting oil as quickly as possible, although a more deliberate pace would have given greater total output. At times, hastily built wells collapsed, oil gushed into the lake and caught fire, burning rigs and equipment. Lago employed Chinese and West Indians as well as Venezuelans, using competition between these groups to keep pay low. The government saw these foreign workers as a source of labor unrest, and in 1929 prohibited further entry of Afro-Caribbean and Chinese workers and demanded that existing workers have a certificate of employment and good conduct. Lago employed about 1,400 workers during the 1930s, mostly based in Lagunillas and La Salina. In 1939 Lago said its employees included 268 foreigners and 3,119 Venezuelans. Most of the local people were simply day laborers.

History In 1996 the University Education Committee and the University Technikon Education Collaboration Committee merged and were tasked to pursue the establishment of a University in the Province by the former MEC for Education, Mr D D Mabuza. The National Institute for Higher Education (Mpumalanga), established in 2006, under the leadership of the late Prof C C Mokadi coordinated the provision of Higher Education in the province. An important milestone was the decision taken at the African National Congress’s National General Council meeting held in eThekwini (Durban) in 2010 which resolved to establish two new universities. This decision was instrumental in facilitating for the establishment of a university in the Mpumalanga Province. In 2010, the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Dr B E Nzimande, appointed two task teams to investigate the feasibility of establishing new universities in Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape. The Mpumalanga task team which submitted a favourable report in September 2011, recommending the establishment of a new University in Mpumalanga was led by Prof T Z Mthembu. In July 2013, the State President, Mr Jacob Zuma, announced the name of the new university as the University of Mpumalanga as well as the names of the members of the Interim Council to oversee its formal establishment. The University of Mpumalanga, a comprehensive university, was formally and legally promulgated through the publication of Government Notice (No. 36772) on 22 August 2013 and launched on 31 October 2013.

It runs from Frederiksberg Runddel to Frederiksberg Town Hall Square, along the east side of Frederiksberg Gardens, connecting Pile Allé to Falkoner Allé. The streetscape is, in spite of the central location, characterized by houses that are pulled back from the street with front gardens behind white fences. Several buildings are old country houses from the time when Frederiksberg was a summer destination outside Copenhagen. Along the northernmost part of the street, on its west side, is a narrow garden complex, Digterlunden (literally \\"Poet's Grove\\") with a statue of Holger Drachmann. History A Sundag in Allégade, illustration from Illustreret Tidende (1861) The street was founded as the main street of a new community, known variously as Ny Holænnerby (\\"New Dutch Town\\") or Nt Amager (\\"New Amager\\"), which was founded when King Christian III transferred 20 Dutch families from Amager in 1651. They built their tenant farms on both sides of the street. Allégade in circa 1890 New Dutch Town was destroyed by Swedish troops during the Siege of Copenhagen in 1658 in the Second Northern War. After the war, the Dutch community returned to the area but, struck with deep poverty, a new church was not completed until 1681 After the turn of the century, the area changed dramatically when King Frederick IV built Frederiksberg Palace on a nearby hilltop. The Dutch farmers were forced away from the area which became a fashionable summer destination, from 1710 known as Frederiksberg. Notable buildings and residents A view down Hollændergade from Allégade Riises Landsted, now Danish Revue Museum Lorry Several of the country houses that were built along the street in the 18th and 19th century are still there today. Møllmanns landsted (No. 6) was built between 1750 and 1753 for Magnus Møllmann, a textile merchant, probably to a design by Philip de Lange. It is in one storey and a Mansard roof and has polygonal projections from the sides and Baroque details on the gables. The design resembles that of Store Mariendals in Hellerup. In 1794, a new building on the street closed the site off, hiding the house from the street. Ludvigs Minde at No. 22 was built by Chief Surveyor Johan Jørgen Berner after he had purchased two of the original farms and merged them into one property. He built two houses on the estate, one for himself and his family and one for summer boarders from Copenhagen. Riises Landsted (\\"Riise's Country House\\"), is a Neo-Classical country house from 1860. It now houses the Danish Revue Museum. The building complex now known as Lorry is a former entertainment venue which traces its history back to 1834. It now contains TV2's local television station for the Copenhagen area and a small theatre, Riddersalen. No. 4 (1850) and No. 10 (1853) are also listed. Digterlunden The Holger Drachmann statue at the north end of Allégade, facing Town Hall Square Digterlunden (\\"Poets' Grove) is a narrow, rectangular garden complex at the northern end of Allégade, on its west side, just south of the Town Hall Square. It consists of four sections with different vegetation and each featuring an artwork depicting a poet with associations to Frederiksberg. Aksel Hansen's bust of H. V. Kaalund The largest of the four artworks is a statue of Holger Drachmann. It was created by Hans Christian Holter who only produced few works due to his early death. Drachmann was a frequent guest at the Lorry establishment where a restaurant was posthumously named after him. The three other artworks are busts. Gottfred Eickhoff's bust of Henri Nathansen faces the Drachmann statue. The two other busts, depicting Meïr Aron Goldschmidt and Hans Vilhelm Kaalund respectively, both face the traffic.

Past scientific research results  In 1960 researchers at MMRI developed a mathematical model for use in the study of atrial fibrillation. In 1966 they demonstrated dual pathways in the AV node and showed the basis for AV nodal tachycardia. In 1973 Institute researchers showed that oscillatory after potentials (delayed afterdepolarizations) was the basis for arrhythmias associated with digitalis toxicity. Over the next several years later they explored modulated parasystole and reflection as mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias. In the 1980s research staff worked to clarify the differences between epicardium and endocardium, and found that the presence of an action potential notch in epicardium, but not endocardium, is responsible for inscription of the electrocardiographic J wave. They found differences in the response of epicardium and endocardium to a variety of drugs and neurotransmitters. The MMRI developed a blood substitute which was patented in 1990. In the 1990s MMRI researchers discovered the M cell, confirming that the heart is made of several different cell types. In 1998 they uncovered the cellular basis for the various waves that appear on an electrocardiogram including the J, T and U waves. Between 1996 and 1998 MMRI published the first gene, SCN5A, to be linked to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). The MMRI named this the Brugada syndrome in 1996, after Josep and Pedro Brugada, who first described this as a new clinical entity in 1992, and in 1999 proposed use of quinidine and isoproterenol for its treatment.\\"Out of the Blue, a Lightning Bolt to the Heart\\". International New York Times, By SANDEEP JAUHAR, FEB. 10, 2004 In 2000 the MMRI research team uncovered evidence linking Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to a congenital heart defect, the Long QT syndrome (LQTS) published in The New England Journal of Medicine. That year they also found experimental evidence, confirmed by later research, that some forms of early repolarization could result in the development of life- threatening arrhythmias. During the next few years MMRI discovered several genes that when mutated give rise to the Long QT, Short QT, Brugada and Early Repolarization syndromes.\\"Brain Sodium Channels in Heart Linked to Sudden Cardiac Death\\". Integrative Medicine, July 2014. They later demonstrated that, ranolazine (Ranexa), a drug approved for ischemic heart disease, was capable of suppressing both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In 2007 MMRI researchers studied atrial-selective sodium channel block as a strategy to manage atrial fibrillation. They later demonstrated that the combination of ranolazine (Ranexa) and dronedarone (Multaq) could prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, which led to Phase 2 clinical trials. In 2010 MMRI described “J Wave Syndromes” a subset of inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes characterized by accentuated J waves, including the Brugada and Early Repolarization syndromes. Soon after, the research team identified Wenxin Keli, a herbal Chinese medicine, as an atrial selective sodium channel blocker capable of suppressing atrial fibrillation in experimental models. In 2012 they also identified Wenxin Keli and Milrinone as potential pharmacological therapies for the Brugada syndrome. = Education and training = The MMRI offers a Postdoctoral Fellowship Program as well as a Predoctoral Research Training Program which is administered in affiliation with SUNY Upstate Medical University at Syracuse, New York.

Plot Senathipathi Thevar (Sathyaraj) is a rich and respected village man who is married to Meenakshi (Sukanya), while his little brother Sethupathi (Sathyaraj) is a good-for-nothing young man. Senathipathi and Lingappan Naicker (Vijayakumar), another rich respected village man and their area chief, are best friends. Senathipathi has been charged for past 10 years with the duty to protect the village against the robbers, which he has done with 100% efficiency. Lingappan Naicker's daughter Aishwarya (Soundarya), a clever, beautiful and arrogant girl, returns after studying in the city. Sethupathi and Aishwarya eventually fall in love with each other. But, Lingappan Naicker is totally against inter-caste marriage and sees them together. Nagappa Naickar (Manivannan) is a long-distant relative of Lingappa and head of their rival village. Though he is rich, Nagappa Naickar has very bad habits and so does his only son. Lingappa's and Nagappa's villages clash every year, to receive water from the canal during farming seasons, though justice is on Lingappan Naicker's village. After failing to get water for the past 10 years, Nagappa Naickar gets the photos of Sethu and Aishwarya clubbing each other. he sends the photo to all of his caste's big heads so that none would wed Aishwarya. then, Nagappa Naickar can make his son marry her and get all properties of Lingappa's to himself, including canal's check-dams owned by him. Meanwhile, to protect Aishwarya, Lingappan Naicker cleverly assigns her to live in Senathipathi's house till her marriage, so that she would be a guarded-object of Senathipathi Thevar so that his brother would be away from her. Sethu and Aishwarya try to break up, but can't. Aishwarya blackmails Sethu to marry her the next day or she will commit suicide. The next day, at the moment of marriage, Senathipathi intercepts Sethu. he asks Sethu to either surrender Aishwarya or comes to a one-on-one till death. Sethu surrenders Aishwarya and is expelled from the house. All of this is seen by Lingappan Naicker afar. he tries to get an alliance to Aishwarya but fails. Then, Nagappa proposes an alliance, and it is taken by Lingappan Naicker. Sethupathi hands over Aishwarya and thus keeps his honour. Then, Aishwarya and her mom plead for Lingappan Naicker to change his mind. When he is about to, Nagappa Naickar and his son come and drag Aiswarya out to be wed. Lingappa shoots both of them dead and starts to find Sethupathi. But, meanwhile, Senathipathi and his wife are attacked on the way home. Though Sethupathi joins them, a traitor stabs both Senathipathi and his wife in the back. At the dying moments, Senathipathi consents for marriage and he removes the thali from his dead wife's neck and gives it to Sethupathi. Sethu then marries Aishwarya there.

McLeod (born 1962) is a Christian apologist, radio talk show host, teacher, writer and founder of the Christian apologetics ministry: Faith Worth Defending. He is an Evangelical Christian and the author of A Well Reasoned Faith: A Rational Defense of God, Jesus and the Bible; Evidence for Skeptics: Answering the biggest Challenges to Christianity; College Christian: How to get your college degree without losing your Christian faith, and other titles. Family and education Kenneth G. McLeod was born in Mobile, Alabama in 1962. He was one of two children born to Frankie and Bettie McLeod. He was an average student in school and did not become interested in education until his senior year of high school. After graduating from Mary G. Montgomery High School, McLeod studied electronics engineering and began a career in the technology industry. Restless to get back into school, he completed two master's degrees, one in business and one in education. After almost 20 years of the corporate world, he started a career in teaching. After a few years teaching mathematics at the high school and university level, he completed a PhD in education from the University of Southern Mississippi. Shortly after, he studied Christian apologetics at Biola University and became a member of the International Society of Christian Apologetics. In 2013, McLeod founded Faith Worth Defending Apologetics Ministry. Career and Ministry According to McLeod, he was converted to Christianity at a young age, but began to see conflicts in science and his faith in the area of evolutionary biology. To reconcile this apparent conflict, he began a study of Christian apologetics in the early ‘90s. As a result of this study, he began a lifelong passion for apologetics, as well as a passion for helping others work through doubts about the validity of Christianity. He has been a guest speaker at churches and universities. Apologetic Arguments  McLeod’s writings center on arguments for the existence of God, the legitimacy of Christianity as the only path to God, and the authenticity of the Bible. In A Well Reasoned Faith:http://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/author/kenneth-g-mcleod- ph-d/page-1/ A Rational Defense of God, Jesus and the Bible (2011), arguments for the existence of God are made on the cosmological, teleological and moral arguments. Arguments for Christianity are made using logical reasoning, historical evidence, eyewitness testimony, and archaeology. Arguments for the authenticity of the bible come from applying the bibliographical, internal and external tests.

The article was quickly refuted by numerous readers of the publication. One article contributor noted the writer \\"works for the Tribeca Film Institute and is likely representing Tribeca by writing this ridiculous and bias article.

Canada, Thomas supported the decision to legalize brothels, saying that \\"any form of criminalization pushes the industry underground and gives opportunities to predators.\\" She made reference to Robert Pickton murdering of several prostitutes, and said that Pickton would not have been able to murder these prostitutes if the law allowed prostitutes to work in escort agencies or red-light districts where they could require their clients to show identification. Former prostitute Natasha Falle responded that, even if such prostitution establishments were legalized, these prostitutes would never have been allowed to work in such places because desperate situations led these women to prostitution, just as will continue to be the case for many other women even if the laws change. When the Court of Appeal for Ontario struck down several prostitution-related laws as part of Bedford v. Canada, Thomas said that there was now a need for sex workers to persuade the public that the new state of affairs was nothing to fear, saying, \\"We are not going to have fire and brimstone and sex workers raining down from the sky.\\" She also said that there is still a need to convince Canadians that sex workers are not subhuman.

He has been on the staff of Texas A&M; University as an Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering since 1980. Early life Bob grew up and attended school in Paris, TX. His father, James Christopher \\"Jimmy\\" Biard of Biardstown, worked as a farmer and a Dr. Pepper route salesman for the local Dr. Pepper company. Bob's mother, Mary Ruth Biard (née Bills), worked as a retail sales person at the Collegiate Shop in downtown Paris. She also sang in quartets at weddings and funerals. When Bob was a child, his pediatrician recommended a diet of mashed overripe bananas, stewed apples, and homemade dried cottage cheese as a remedy for digestive issues. As a Dr. Pepper salesman, Jimmy knew all of the local grocery store owners and they would save the overripe bananas for Bob. Mary would make the cottage cheese by placing unpasteurized milk in a cup towel and hanging it on an outdoor clothes line. Jimmy eventually became manager of the local 7-Up company and ended up buying it from the former owner. He also sold used cars, worked as a master plumber at Camp Maxey (an army camp north of Paris) during and after WW-II, and did plumbing work for homes and businesses in the Paris area. While in high school, Bob worked for his father and an off duty fireman, who was also a plumber, during the summer as a plumber's assistant. Later in life, Jimmy became chief deputy sheriff in Lamar County, TX. Education Bob attended Paris High School from 1944-48. After receiving an associate degree from Paris Junior College in 1951, he transferred to Texas A&M; University in College Station, TX where he received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering (June 1954), an M.S. in Electrical Engineering (January 1956), and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (May 1957). Among the scholarships he received were the Dow-Corning Award in 1953-54, and the Westinghouse and Texas Power & Light fellowships throughout his graduate work. He was also a member of IRE, Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and an associate member of Sigma Xi. From 1956-57, he worked part-time as an instructor of undergraduate Electrical Engineering courses. He also worked part-time as an Assistance Research Engineer for the Texas Engineering Experiment Station in charge of operation and maintenance of EESEAC, the Station's analog computer. During grad school, he also designed several vacuum tube DC amplifiers. His PhD dissertation was entitled, \\"Further Investigation of Electronic Multiplication of Voltages By Use of Logarithms\\".

The GaAs IR Light-Emitting Diode In 1959, Dr. Biard and Gary Pittman were assigned to work together in the Semiconductor Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) on the creation of GaAs varactor diodes for X-band parametric amplifiers to be used in radar receivers. In September 1961, they discovered infrared light emission from a forward biased tunnel diode they had constructed on gallium arsenide (GaAs) semi-insulating substrate. Using an infrared image converter microscope recently brought in from Japan, they discovered all of the GaAs varactor diodes and tunnel diodes they had manufactured at the time emitted infrared light. In October 1961, they demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically isolated semiconductor photodetector. On August 8, 1962, Biard and Pittman filed a patent describing a zinc diffused p-n junction LED with spaced cathode contacts to allow for efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias. After four years spent establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks, the U.S. patent office determined their work predated submissions from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs, Bell Labs, and Lincoln Labs at MIT. As a result, the two inventors were issued U.S. patent 3,293,513 US Patent 3293513, Biard, James R. and Gary Pittman, \\"Semiconductor Radiant Diode\\", Filed: Aug. 8, 1962, Issued: Dec. 20, 1966. http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3293513.pdf for the GaAs infrared (IR) light- emitting diode. Most other organized research seeking LEDs at the time used II-VI semiconductors like cadmium sulfide (CdS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe), while Biard and Pittman's patent used gallium arsenide (GaAs), a III/V semiconductor. After filing the patent, TI immediately began a project to manufacture infrared diodes. On Oct. 26th, 1962, TI announced the first commercial LED product, the SNX-100. It sold for a price of $130 per unit. The SNX-100 employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit a 900 nm light output. It used gold-zinc for the P-type contact and tin alloy for the N-type contact. TI gave Biard and Pittman $1.00 each for their patent. The IBM Card Verifier was the first commercial device to use infrared LEDs. The LEDs replaced tungsten bulbs that controlled punched card readers. Infrared light was sent through the holes or blocked by the card, which not only significantly reduced the size and power required, but also improved the reliability. In November 1978, Tom M. Hyltin, a former engineering manager at Texas Instruments, published a book titled \\"The Digital Electronic Watch\\", in which he cited Dr. Biard and Gary Pittman's 1961 discovery as being fundamentally important to the creation of the digital wrist-watch. In August 2013, during a recollection of the patent, Dr. Biard stated the following: > The first diodes that we saw emitting light were not designed to be LEDs. > They were varactor diodes and tunnel diodes, which had all of the N-type > surface and P-type surface covered with Ohmic contact to achieve a low > series resistance. At the time, the varactor diodes had an etched mesa > geometry and the IR light came out around the edge of the mesa. On the > tunnel diodes, the light could be seen at the edges of the chip. They did > not emit very much light, but it was enough for us to see with the IR image > converter microscope. That led us to create a structure in which the N-type > surface of the chip had spaced contacts, so the light emitted at the > junction could be emitted from most of the top surface of the chip. Gary > made those spaced N-type Ohmic contacts by tin plating metal wires and > alloying the tin on the surface of the wire to the N-type GaAs surface. With > a rectangular chip of GaAs, most of the light emitted at the junction was > reflected at the exit surface. The index of refraction of GaAs is 3.6 and > air has an index of 1.0. This means that ~97% of the light emitted at the > junction is totally internally reflected at the exit surface. The highest > quantum efficiency that can be expected from a rectangular LED chip is ~2%, > even with an anti-reflection coating on the optical exit surface. This total > internal reflection problem led us to come up with the hemispherical dome > LED. In this diode the N-type GaAs substrate is shaped into a hemisphere and > the hemispherical surface is covered with an anti-reflection coating > (preferably silicon nitride) to minimize front surface reflection. The LED > P-N junction is in the center of the flat face of the hemisphere. The > central P-type region is covered with the anode Ohmic contact. The cathode > Ohmic contact was a donut shape that covered most of the remainder of the > N-type flat surface of the hemisphere. By making the diameter of the > hemisphere 3.6 times larger than the diameter of the P-type layer, all the > light at the exit surface of the hemisphere was inside the critical angle > for total internal reflection. This resulted in a huge increase in quantum > efficiency because up to 50% of the light emitted at the junction could > escape from the chip at the hemispherical exit surface. The other half of > the light went toward the P-type Ohmic contact and was absorbed in the GaAs. > The absorption in the thicker N-type GaAs between the junction and exit > surface resulted in less improvement in quantum efficiency than what we had > hoped for, however, the dome LEDs were much more efficient. The Optical Isolator A Texas Instruments PEX3002 Optoelectronic Multiplex Switch consisting of two silicon phototransistors illuminated by a single, GaAs dome LED. On November 29, 1963 Dr. Biard, Gary Pittman, Edward L. Bonin, and Jack Kilby filed a patent titled \\"Photosensitive Transistor Chopper Using Light Emissive Diode\\".US Patent 3304431, Biard, James R., \\"Photosensitive Transistor Chopper Using Light Emissive Diode\\", Filed: Nov. 29, 1963, Issued: Feb. 14, 1967. http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3304431.pdf Within the patent they described a phototransistor chopper consisting of an LED optically coupled with a dual emitter, photosensitive, silicon transistor. The arrangement provided a switching function in which the switch was completely electrically isolated from the LED that drove it. The transistor operated in response to light emitted from the LED when forward current bias was generated across the junction of the diode. When emitted light struck the surface of the transistor, it was absorbed in the regions of both the emitter-base and base- collector junctions causing the transistor to conduct. This photoconductive transistor could be rapidly turned on and off by intensity modulating the LED at a very high frequency using high frequency alternating voltage. Prior to their invention, complete electrical isolation of the switch element in a chopper from the driving source for opening and closing the switch element was not possible, even through use of isolation transformers. Using isolation transformers, which were bulky and expensive, in miniaturized circuits to separate the driving source and the switch element resulted in magnetic pick- up and spike feed-through due to the transformer winding capacitance. Optical isolators were ideal because they're very small and can be mounted to a circuit board. In addition, they offer protection against excessively high voltages, reduce noise levels, and make measurements more accurate. In March 1964, TI announced commercial chopper devices based on their patent bearing designations PEX3002 and PEX3003. In March 1965, TI announced the SNX1304 Optoelectronic Pulse Amplifier, which was conceived and developed by Dr. Biard and Jerry Merryman, the inventor of the first handheld digital calculator. The SNX1304 consisted of a GaAs p-n junction light emitter optically coupled to an integrated silicon photodetector feedback-amplifier circuit. The device is thought to be the first commercial optically coupled integrated circuit. The MOS ROM MOS Binary-to-Decimal Decoder In 1964, TI's Opto branch developed a monolithic visible LED element consisting of a 3x5 array of red LEDs capable of displaying the numbers 0-9. The device was lacking a means of driving the array, so Dr. Biard and Bob Crawford (from the MOS branch) designed a P-channel MOS circuit using binary coded decimal inputs to turn on the appropriate 15 output lines. The MOS circuit worked on the first pass and was implemented into a simulated cockpit altimeter. TI displayed the altimeter in a booth at a New York IEEE show and convention. Biard and Crawford filed a patent for their device (U.S. Patent US3541543) on July 25, 1966, referred to as the \\"Binary Decoder\\". This was the first time a Read Only Memory had been made using MOS transistors. By the late 1970s, MOS ROM devices had become the most common example of nonvolatile memory used to provide the storage of fixed programs in digital equipment such as calculators and microprocessor systems. In 1986, TI filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (ITC) charging 19 different firms with violating US tariff laws by importing 256K and 64K dynamic RAM devices, which infringed numerous TI patents including US Patent 3,541,543. Per the request of Texas Instruments, Dr. Biard testified before the ITC in Washington D.C.; however, the judge determined that the firms did not violate TI's patent rights. Schottky-clamped Logic Circuits Diagram of the Schottky-clamped transistor In 1964, Dr. Biard designed linear transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) to work with silicon photodiodes for receiving optical signals generated by LEDs. When the signal current from the silicon photodiode was too large, the input stage of the amplifier would saturate and cause undesirable delays when the optical signal was removed. Dr. Biard solved this problem by connecting a silicon HP Schottky diode across the collector-base junction of the input transistor. Since the Schottky diode had a lower forward drop than the transistor PN junction, the transistor did not saturate and the undesirable delay time was eliminated. The engineer in the next office at the SRD Lab was developing Diode Transistor Logic (DTL) ICs and also having saturation problems. Dr. Biard decided to use what he learned with the optical receiver amplifiers and apply that to the bipolar logic circuits. On December 31, 1964, Dr. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor (U.S. Patent US3463975), a.k.a. the Schottky-clamped transistor, which consisted of a transistor and an internal metal- semiconductor Schottky-barrier diode.Schottky-Barrier Diode Doubles the Speed of TTL Memory & Logic http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1969-Schottky.html The patent was filed based on Schottky Clamped DTL monolithic integrated logic circuits using aluminum-silicon Schottky diodes across the collector-base junctions of the transistors and in the input to adjust the logic levels. The diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The Schottky diode could be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. Dr. Biard's patent was filed before Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) circuits had been invented, yet it was written broadly enough to cover the Schottky clamped TTL ICs using platinum silicide Schottky diodes, which were much more predictable and manufacturable than the aluminum Schottky diodes he originally used. His patent ultimately improved the switching speed of saturated logic designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost. In 1985, Dr. Biard received the Patrick E. Haggerty Innovation Award for this patent. Avalanche Photodiodes In the 1960s, during the ongoing development of integrated circuit related technologies, avalanche photodiodes were afflicted by a relatively high bulk leakage current, which was amplified by the avalanche gain. The leakage current resulted from holes and electrons thermally generated in the device. This leakage current restricted the photodiode's use, unless a cooling apparatus was used conjunctively. On February 15, 1968 Dr. Biard filed a patent titled \\"Low Bulk Leakage Current Avalanche Photodiode\\" (U.S. Patent US3534231),\\"Low Bulk Leakage Current Avalanche Photodiode\\", Biard, James R., The Smithsonian Chip Collection, Oct. 13, 1970 http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/patents/3534231.htm which presented the design of an avalanche photodiode to reduce the bulk leakage currents without having to be cooled. The design consisted of three semiconductor layers, located one on the other, with a barrier layer below the photosensitive junction in the form of a reverse biased second junction. The first two layers constituted the photosensitive junction and the third layer constituted a highly doped semiconductor back region present at a distance from the photosensitive junction smaller than a diffusion length of the thermally generated carriers. =Spectronics= Dr. Biard serving as Vice President of the Spectronics Research and Development Division (1976). In May 1969, Dr. Biard left Texas Instruments to join Spectronics, Inc., when the company was founded, as Vice President of Research. While at Spectronics, Dr. Biard worked on the design of many of their standard products including silicon photodiodes, phototransistors, photodarlington devices, and GaAs light-emitting diodes.

He is a master blender of cigars who is renowned not only for those skills but for his tasting seminars, in which he educates cigar consumers on the intricacies of cigar construction, tobacco blending, and taste.  Early life  José Blanco was born on October 27, 1949, to Dominican parents in political exile from the dictatorial regime of General Rafael Trujillo. The family returned to the Dominican Republic in 1961 following Trujillo's assassination.An Interview with José Blanco: The gregarious sales director for La Aurora speaks about the cigar industry by David Savona, Cigar Aficionado, Mar/Apr 2006. Back in the Dominican Republic, his father started growing tobacco. His uncle owned a cigar factory as well as a farm, so he and his cousin, Jochi, spent summers there learning to ferment, age and sort tobacco. His love affair with the finished product began at age 15, when he smoked his first cigar from his uncle's factory.  Family  He is married to Emma Viktorsson, the daughter of the retired Director for Eastern Europe for Swedish Match, Ake Viktorsson. They have a young son, Jasper, born in 2012. José also has three adult children from a previous marriage; Euler, Lourdes and Gregory. His cousin - also christened José but known as “Jochi” - Blanco is a tobacco grower and the owner and president of Tabacalera La Palma in Tamboril, Dominican Republic.  Career  In 1974, he began his sales career as a salesman for a Dominican rum maker.José Blanco leaves La Aurora by Frank Seltzer, cigarweekly.com, 15 Jun 2011. In 1980, he joined Grupo León Jimenes (now Empresa León Jimenes) to sell Presidente beer and Marlboro cigarettes.José Blanco Leaving La Aurora by David Savona, Cigar Aficionado online, 15 Jun 2011. He worked his way up the corporate ladder to Supervisor (1985), Sales Coordinator (1990), Manager of Promotions and Public Relations (1992) and, finally, Sales Manager for Beer and Cigarettes for the Northeast Dominican Republic (1995). Even though his primary duties did not involve cigars, he was asked to become an unofficial member of the company's cigar taste testing panel by Guillermo Léon when the latter took over the cigar division, La Aurora. = Cigars: La Aurora = In 1999, he was finally able to join the La Aurora cigar division as their Sales Manager. To this point, his cigar consumption consisted mainly of cigars made from Dominican filler with Cameroon or Connecticut wrappers, along with the occasional Cuban cigar. Once he started visiting cigar retailers in his new position, he began to discover tobaccos from other countries, such as Honduras, Nicaragua, and Ecuador. He developed a passion for blending – “I don't care how good a cigar is, if it's good and it's one-dimensional, to me it's just a good, boring smoke. I like cigars that are complex and change a lot.” He began to work on blends for La Aurora. His first major success as a blender came with the 100 Años, created to celebrate La Aurora's 100th anniversary in 2003. The 100 Años won La Aurora some unaccustomed accolades – in Cigar Aficionado magazine's annual ranking of the top 25 cigars of the year, the 100 Años Belicoso was ranked 2nd. He followed this success with the 1495 Series, the 107, and the Barrel Aged blends.A Conversation with José Blanco by Frank Seltzer, cigarweekly.com, 10 Mar 2008. After 31 years with Empresa León Jimenes and La Aurora, Blanco retired from the company on 15 June 2011. = Cigars: Joya de Nicaragua = His retirement was short-lived, however, as in September 2011 he accepted an invitation to become Senior Vice President of Joya de Nicaragua S.A. from its owner, Dr. Alejandro Martinez Cuenca.News: José Blanco Joins Joya de Nicaragua, stogieguys.com, 1 Sep 2011. His duties consisted of Blend and Brand Development, and he reported directly to Dr. Cuenca.José Blanco Named Senior Vice president of Joya de Nicaragua by Erik Calviño, Cigar Snob online, 31 Aug 2011. The first blend to emerge from this new association, released in August 2012, was called Cuenca y Blanco. The cigar was well received, but the name was troublesome, as there were already trademarked, established cigar brands called “Cuenca” and “Blanco.” The name was eventually shortened to CyB in October.Name Change: Cuenca y Blanco Becomes CyB by David Savona, Cigar Aficionado online, 8 Oct 2012. The cigar appeared on many “Best of 2012” lists throughout the industry. On halfwheel.com, which posts a consensus of 53 different such lists, the CyB was Cigar of the Year: “The cigar formerly known as Cuenca y Blanco appeared on 25 of the 53 lists, the next closest cigar by that measure…appeared on only 17. But the numbers for total score weren’t even close, the eponymous release…had a lead over the second place (cigar) that was roughly seven times what (the winner) had over its second place rival when it won the award last year.”2012 Awards: The Consensus by Charlie Minato, halfwheel.com, 9 Jan 2013 = Cigars: Señorial = = Cigars: EPC Cigars = In 2016, Jose Blanco was hired as senior vice president of EPC Cigars in the Dominican Republic.

In this role, Jose will work closely with and provide support to Arturo Fuente International as it builds and grows the Arturo Fuente brand throughout the world.  Seminars  José Blanco began giving his highly acclaimed tasting and blending seminars when he was Sales Manager with La Aurora, and has continued to do so to the present day:Blanco Joins Joyo de Nicaragua by David Savona, Cigar Aficionado online, 31 Aug 2011. “What I get are a lot of questions about education – unfortunately there are a lot of misconceptions that consumers have. One of the things that unfortunately we have is a lot of people talking about tobacco, cigars, origins, and characteristics that they don’t really know about. They hear it from somebody and then they continue it along. That’s why I encourage people to go to the seminars, where you can get a first-hand look and taste for the things that you should be looking for when you are smoking a cigar.”Five questions for José Blanco, senior vice president of Joya de Nicaragua by Patrick Lagried, examiner.com, 26 Oct 2011. Even José has lost track of how many seminars he has given over the years, but there is a documented figure of 150 in 2009 alone. José estimated in 2011 that, “(i)n the last four years I’ve probably done 450 seminars.” The seminars themselves have changed over the years. He used to give each attendee four corona-sized cigars rolled with a single grade of tobacco. In this way, smokers could discern what tastes to expect from a certain type of tobacco – something that is difficult to do in a store-bought, pre-blended cigar.Blend a Cigar in Five Not So Simple Steps by Tom Johansmeyer, luxist.com, 27 May 2010. In the latest incarnation of the seminar, he provides a single, larger cigar wrapped in non-overlapping bands of five different wrapper leaves, so that attendees can judge for themselves the effect each type of wrapper has on a cigar when the filler and binder are constant.

It has tended to take the form of public feedback, project development, or petitions in the past, but has grown to include public drafting of bills and constitutions, among other things. This form of public involvement in the governing process differs from older systems of popular action, from town halls to referenda, in that it is primarily conducted online or through a similar IT medium. The increasing embrace of government crowdsourcing, both actual and nominal, has been driven by a demand for greater civic engagement and popular demands for accountability,Aitamurto, Tanja; Landemore, Helene (2016). \\"Crowdsourced Deliberation: The Case of the Law on Off-Road Traffic in Finland\\". p. 174 Policy Studies Organization. as well as by the tendency of authors and journalists to use the term \\"crowdsourcing\\" to describe various collaborative online process. Whether many recent programs of public involvement, such as ship naming polls, and online structures of participatory democracy, such as online petitions, are forms of government crowdsourcing is still debated today. Various thinkers, including but not limited to Daren Brabham, Beth Noveck, and Helene Landemore, have each presented their own definitions of what crowdsourcing as a whole, and government crowdsourcing by extension, necessarily entails, but there has been no consensus thus far. Governments which have adopted crowdsourcing as a method of information gathering, policy guidance, and in some cases a vital part of the lawmaking process include Brazil, Finland, Iceland, Egypt, Tunisia, and the United States, among many others. Each case varies in structure and level of influence granted to involved citizens, ranging from massive crowds providing purely advisory feedback to small randomly selected committees drafting entire pieces of legislation. Precursors to government crowdsourcing Though, in the past, direct democracy employed many of the same mechanisms as government crowdsourcing, and indeed could resemble it at times, the objectives direct democracy tended to pursue and the methods it used set it apart. Crowdsourcing requires a specific goal, rewards to be gained by both the crowd and the government, and an open request for anyone to participate, as well as to be conducted through the internet or some other IT medium. Programs which truly resembled pre-Internet government crowdsourcing did not emerge until the 17th and 18th centuries. These were government- sponsored competitions such as the Alkali prize, which lead to the development of the Leblanc Process, and the Longitude Prize. Other early precursors to government crowdsourcing either followed the same model of reaching out in search of an expert or inventor capable of solving the problem at hand, via what Brabham refers to as the \\"broadcast-search model.\\" The American government distributed large tasks, such as mapping wind and current patterns along trade routes among American sailors, delegating the discovery of existing knowledge to a crowd in a model similar to what is now referred to as \\"distributed human intelligence tasking.\\" (Hern, Chester G.(2002). Tracks in the Sea, p. 123 & 246\\\\. McGraw Hill. .) Finally, the French Cahiers de doléances were the most directly governmental example of pre-Internet government crowdsourcing. In the leadup to the French Revolution, the three estates listed their grievances and made suggestions to improve the government.\\"Cahiers De Doléances.\\" The French Revolution: A Document Collection. Ed. Laura Mason and Tracey Rizzo. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. 54-58. Print. These problems, complaints, and proposals were considered and debated through the sessions of the Estates general.Kagan, Donald \\"The Western Heritage-Seventh Edition\\" (Pg 631), 2001 Similar efforts to hear the grievances and suggestions of subjects, and later constituents, can be seen at the heart of various political institutions around the world, such as town halls in the United States, petitions in the United Kingdom and beyond.  Modern government crowdsourcing Today, government crowdsourcing follows similar models, albeit utilizing the internet and other IT mediums. Around the world, governments continue to use competitions, delegate large tasks, and reach out to their constituents for feedback both on specific bills and for guidance on various policies. They have also begun, in countries as different as Brazil, British Columbia, and Finland, to not only draw feedback, expertise, and ideas from the crowd, but also specific provisions and wordings for legislation and even constitutions. These initiatives, which give participating constituents greater leeway to both develop their ideas, deliberate, and be heard, mirroring what Brabham describes as \\"peer-vetted creative crowdsourcing.\\" The established models continue to work as well as they ever did, but attempts at crowdlaw and crowdsourced constitutions have met with mixed results. In some cases, the crowdsourcing platform has been purely suggestive, as in British Columbia, and their proposal ultimately put to a vote. Generally, once those crowdsourced suggestions entered the political system, they were either voted down or buried under mountains of procedural delay. In other rarer cases, the efforts succeeded and the crowdsourced laws were adopted, though in somewhat amended form, as happened with the Brazilian Internet Bill of Rights and in the Constitutional Convention (Ireland). Other efforts to crowdsource government are still in process, or have only been tested on a limited scale, leaving their long-term results still uncertain. In several post-revolutionary moments, notably those of Tunisia, Iceland, and Egypt, the new governments have also used crowdsourcing as a means of securing legitimacy and addressing the issues which brought them into power in the first place. This method of constitution making has been met with a limited level of success. The Icelandic constitution, crowdsourced in the aftermath of the 2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests, utilized a multi-layered crowdsourcing structure, with an elected council at the top synthesizing suggestions into the new constitution, a popular forum for the crowd to make their voiced heard, and a Constitutional committee to organize the other parts. By contrast, the Egyptian and Tunisian constitutional processes involved the crowd much less, with an official constitutional assembly composed of traditional political elites who simply received feedback on their draft clauses online. Defining government crowdsourcing Today, there is still no definitive definition of crowdsourcing, and even less agreement as to what aspects of participatory democracy fit under that description. Most academics and writers tend to create their own definitions. The most expansive definition of crowdsourcing, drawn from a survey of thousands of papers on the topic, describes it as something for which: (a) there is a clearly defined crowd; (b) there exists a task with a clear goal; (c) the recompense received by the crowd is clear; (d) the crowdsourcer is clearly identified; (e) the compensation to be received by the crowdsourcer is clearly defined; (f) it is an online assigned process of participative type; (g) it uses an open call of variable extent; (h) it uses the internet Other definitions are less exhaustive and more case-specific. Helene Landemore, following a similar line of thought as Brabham, defines crowdsourcing as an online problem-solving and production model in which an undefined crowd helps to complete a task by submitting knowledge, information, or talent. In its unrefined form, there is no accountability mechanism, and the crowd, unlike contractors in an outsourcing system, is not vetted. She further distinguishes it from Wikipedia-esque \\"commons-based peer production,\\" noting that crowdsourcing generally takes the form of individuals commenting and making suggestions in a vacuum as opposed to deliberating, discussing, and collaborating with one another.Brabham, Daren (2013). Crowdsourcing (PDF). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. p. 35Landemore, Helene (2015). \\"Inclusive Constitution-Making: The Icelandic Experiment\\". The Journal of Political Philosophy. Brahbam also makes a subtle distinction which makes his definition substantially more restrictive. For an aspect of participatory government to be crowdsourcing, it cannot be purely a government-driven sequence of responses from the crowd. Both sides must engage in direction and deliberation on the project.Brabham, Daren (2013). Crowdsourcing (PDF). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. p. 44-50 Under this definition, certain elements of governmental participation, such as the Peer to Patent project aren't crowdsourcing at all, but rather similar processes which have been agglomerated under a new and trendy name. Mabhoudi, on the other hand, defines it purely in terms of constitution making. His conception of crowdsourcing consists of posting a draft constitution online, utilizing both official websites and social media pages. Those platforms were used for feedback, commentary, recommendations, and possibly final approval. Left out of his definition, but noted in his description of the process of Egyptian constitution making is the use of committees to document, digest, and synthesize the volumes of online feedback into a more readable form, which served an indispensable role in the success, however temporary, of the crowdsourcing process.Maboudi, Tofigh (2016). \\"Crowdsourcing the Egyptian Constitution: Social Media, Elites, and the Populace\\". Political Research Quarterly. 69 (4): 716-731 Noveck refers to government crowdsourcing as \\"collaborative democracy.\\" Noveck, Beth (2009). Wiki-Government: How Technology Can. Make Government Better, Democracy. Stronger, and Citizens More Powerful. Brookings. p. 17 She defines that as a process of using technology to improve government outcomes by soliciting experience from groups of self- selected peers working together in groups of open networks.Ibid. Her version of government crowdsourcing more closely resembles the government competitions of the 17th and 18th centuries, or Amazon's Mechanical Turk, than the more participatory model favored by other thinkers.Noveck, Beth (2009). Wiki- Government: How Technology Can. Make Government Better, Democracy. Stronger, and Citizens More Powerful. Brookings. p. 71 That is, crowds gathered to work on an agenda set out by the government, pooling their diverse expertises to cover every possible field of information.  Examples of government crowdsourcing  = United States Federal Government =  Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  Open Opportunities is a government wide program offering professional development opportunities to current federal employees and internships to students. The program facilitates collaboration and knowledge sharing across the Federal Government. Open Opportunities is for federal employees looking to gain additional experience, and students looking for internships. The program offers a wide variety of real world projects that promote experiential learning.  Department of State  The Virtual Student Foreign Service is a crowd-work and eIntern program for college students. The Office of eDiplomacy is developing an internal crowdsourcing platform called CrowdWork that will facilitate collaborative work worldwide. Any office or mission will be able to post tasks online and any State Department employee with the requisite skills will be able to respond and complete the task. This creates an internal marketplace for foreign affairs work and matches State Department opportunities and requirements with untapped skills and experience. The platform is currently under development with an anticipated launch in December 2013. This crowd-work platform will be developed as part of an innovation toolkit for the U.S. Government.White House Presidential Innovation Fellows Innovation Toolkit This project is developed through a partnership between the State Department office of eDiplomacy, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the General Services Administration and the State Department Office of the Director General. The crowdwork element of the innovation toolkit will be developed as an open source platform for public use. The State Department Sounding Board is an internal ideation tool for employees to suggest improvements to the Department. The Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU),http://hiu.state.gov a division within the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the U.S. Department of State, is working to increase the availability of spatial data in areas experiencing humanitarian emergencies. Built from a crowdsourcing model, the new \\"Imagery to the Crowd\\" process publishes high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, purchased by the United States Government, in a web-based format that can be easily mapped by volunteers. The digital map data generated by the volunteers are stored in a database maintained by OpenStreetMap (OSM), a UK-registered non-profit foundation, under a license that ensures the data are freely available and open for a range of uses. Inspired by the success of the OSM mapping effort after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Imagery to the Crowd process harnesses the combined power of satellite imagery and the volunteer mapping community to help aid agencies provide informed and effective humanitarian assistance, and plan recovery and development activities. The HIU partners with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) on many of the Imagery to the Crowd projects. HOT provides volunteer support and access to its micro-tasking platform, the OSM Tasking Manager, which coordinates volunteer efforts by breaking down large mapping tasks into smaller areas that can be digitized in 45–60 minutes. A 5-minute Imagery to the Crowd Ignite talk is available. The Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs partnered with RocketHub on the Alumni Engagement and Innovation Fund (AEIF) 2.0 which helps exchange program alumni crowdsource funding for their innovative projects. The Special Advisor for Civil Society and Emerging Democracies created Diplomacy Lab as a way for the Department to crowdsource longer-term projects from the academic community. Human Resource's Flex Connect program facilitates crowdsourcing of talent from across the Department. eDiplomacy is also piloting a State Department GitHub Account to collaborate on open source software projects. The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance also ran a crowdsourced Arms Control Challenge examining how technology could aid arms control efforts.  USAID  In June 2012, USAID launched the Agency's first-ever crowdsourcing initiative to pinpoint the location of USAID Development Credit Authority (DCA) loan data and make the dataset publicly available. Crowdsourcing is a distributed problem-solving process whereby tasks are outsourced to a network of people known as \\"the crowd\\". The engagement of the Crowd was an innovative way to process data and increase the transparency of the Agency. Visualizing where USAID enhances the capacity of the private sector can signal new areas for potential collaboration with host countries, researchers, development organizations, and the public. A case study explains the organizational, legal, and technical steps behind making these data open.  Department of Health and Human Services  CDCology is a way for CDC staff to post unclassified, one-minute to one-day long (micro)tasks that can be solved by undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate student volunteers. This expands the agency's workforce and relieves staff to focus on in-depth assignments. In return, universities can offer students short challenges directly impacting national initiatives and gain experience with government work. This allows students to bring fresh ideas to smaller projects and they can add \\"micro- volunteering for CDC\\" to their résumé.CDC crowd-work and eIntern Program:  Environmental Protection Agency  Pilot project launched by the Administrator's office called Skills Marketplace allowing micro-details to other offices and projects.  General Services Administration  Challenge.gov is an online challenge platform administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in partnership with ChallengePost that empowers the U.S. Government and the public to bring the best ideas and top talent to bear on our nation's most pressing challenges.

It is a message-based game to encourage innovative thinking by many people, connected via the Web. It has been used to study a number of topics, such as how the Navy can prepare for the future of energy......starting in 2021 and beyond  United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has been working to integrate crowdsourcing into the patent process in a number of ways. The first key step was the introduction of the Peer to Patent program at the application review stage. Peer to Patent was designed to allow members of the public with relevant technical skills and information to submit information useful to the patent examiner when assessing the claims of pending patent applications. The first pilot Peer to Patent program, limited to software and business methods applications, was launched in 2007 and remained open through 2009. After reviewing the results, a second expanded pilot was launched in 2010, extending coverage to include biotechnology, bioinformatics, telecommunications, and speech recognition. The USPTO was further encouraged to implement crowdsourcing by the Obama Administration's Executive Action on Crowdsourcing Prior Art. The order was created with the goal of improving patent quality overall and fostering innovation by integrating new ways for companies, experts, and the general public to find and submit \\"prior art\\" or evidence needed to ascertain if an invention is novel. Having tested crowdsourcing during the application review process, the USPTO turned to explore applications for crowdsourcing during post-grant patent review. To do this, the USPTO consulted experts in the government and private sector to share their expertise through two roundtable discussions. The Roundtable on the Use of Crowdsourcing and Third-Party Preissuance Submissions to Identify Relevant Prior Art, took place April 10, 2014. Presenters at the roundtable included Andrea Casillas and Christopher Wong sharing their experience with Peer to Patent; Micah Siegel from Ask Patents, a patent crowdsourcing project through stack exchange; Pedram Sameni from Patexia, a crowdsourcing platform focused on patent research and prior art searching; and Cheryl Milone of Article One Partners. The USPTO held their second roundtable on the use of crowdsourcing to identify relevant prior art on December 2, 2014. This roundtable focused on two key questions: (1) how the USPTO can utilize crowdsourcing tools to obtain relevant prior art in order to enhance the quality of examination and issued patents; and (2) ways the USPTO can leverage existing private sector solutions for the electronic receipt and hosting of crowdsourced materials as a means to provide prior art to examiners. Speakers at the roundtable included Matt Levy (Computer & Communications Industry Association), Mark Nowotarski (Markets, Patents & Alliances LLC), Cheryl Milone (Article One Partners), and Pedram Sameni (Patexia Inc.). The USPTO continues to consider additional applications for crowdsourcing following the roundtables and public comments submitted in response. As part of that goal, they are working with Christopher Wong, who was appointed to be the Presidential Innovation Fellow supporting crowdsourcing and patent reform initiatives for the USPTO. = United Kingdom =  National Health Service  The Patient Feedback Challenge is about getting the NHS to use feedback from patients to improve services, by spreading the best approaches already out there.

He developed a considerable ownership in the transport sector, having established the Panadura Bus Company and owning transport lorries. He also owned many Tea and Rubber plantations in Ceylon, the Gikiyanakande and Meddegedara estates among them. The Gikiyanakande estate was owned previously by Queen Elizabeth's cousin, Lord Elphinstone. The signing of the deeds at the time of purchase by Fernando were done at Buckingham Palace in 1950. He also owned significant shareholdings in Associated Motorways (AMW), Central Hospitals and the Southwestern bus company. The Panadura Bus Company was later nationalised in 1958 to form the Ceylon Transport Board. At the time of his death in 1954, Panadura Motor Transit (PMT) owned more than 350 buses, 200 lorries and more than 10,000 acres of tea and rubber plantations, apart from his significant investments in several top companies in Ceylon. He donated the college hall of Sri Sumangala College in his home town of Panadura. Fernando was elected to the Parliament of Ceylon at the 1st parliamentary election in 1947 representing the Buttala electorate, securing over 77% of the vote. He retained the seat at the subsequent parliamentary elections in 1952, with a healthy 70% of the vote and remained in parliament until his death in 1954.

The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple, the series' new showrunner, and directed by Greg Nicotero. The episode takes place several months after the previous episode, and the expanded survivor group is living an ideal life at the prison before a new threat arises. This episode marks the first appearance of Lawrence Gilliard Jr. as Bob Stookey. The episode was received positively by critics and was watched by 16.11 million viewers, marking a series high in viewers and adults 18–49. Plot Several months have passed, in which the remaining citizens of Woodbury have joined the survivor group at the prison. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), having renounced leadership of the group, has taken to farming to set an example to his son Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs). While he is walking outside in his garden, he notices several walkers have accumulated outside the prison. Carl approaches him and notices that one of the pigs his father takes care of, \\"Violet\\", appears ill. Rick tells Carl to stop naming the pigs since they are food, and admits he does not know why the pig is ill. Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) has increased in popularity among the residents for his role as the group's hunter; Carl's friend, Patrick (Vincent Martella) thanks Daryl for supplying the meat through his hunting. Carol (Melissa McBride) speaks privately with Daryl about the walkers, noting they are not spreading themselves along the fence line as before. Elsewhere, Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) tells his wife Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) that she should not accompany him on the supply run scheduled for later that day. Carl criticizes a group of the prison's children, Lizzie (Brighton Sharbino) and her sister, Mika (Kyla Kenedy), among them, for naming one of the walkers at the fence. While several survivors kill the accumulated walkers at the fence, Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman) speaks with Karen (Melissa Ponzio), and confides his discomfort with killing walkers along the gate, as it means looking into their faces. Michonne (Danai Gurira) returns to the prison after unsuccessfully hunting for The Governor and shares her intention to travel to Macon County to continue her search. She volunteers to check the hunting traps for animals, but Rick decides to go himself. As he leaves, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) tells Rick that their council – himself, Glenn, Carol, Daryl, and Tyreese's sister, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) – prefers that Rick carry a gun when he goes outside the gates, for protection. Carol meanwhile secretly uses a storytime session with the prison's children to teach them about the use of weaponry. Patrick, feeling ill, leaves early. Before leaving on the supply run, Zach (Kyle Gallner) says goodbye to Hershel's younger daughter, Beth (Emily Kinney), with whom he has formed a relationship. Bob Stookey (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.), a former army medic and a new addition to the group, volunteers to go along to earn his keep; after some hesitation, Sasha allows him to come. The group reaches an abandoned army camp around a grocery store, where they begin to gather supplies. Bob approaches an alcohol aisle in the store and is tempted to take a bottle of wine. He decides to put it back, causing the entire shelf to fall on him. This also attracts the attention of walkers on the roof, who begin to fall through the decaying ceiling. Daryl and Zach are able to free Bob, but Zach is bitten and killed in the process. The rest of the group escapes as a wrecked helicopter falls through the roof, destroying the store and the remaining walkers. Rick is checking the traps when he encounters a woman named Clara (Kerry Condon), whom he initially mistakes for a walker. She asks if he is with a group and begs him to take her and her husband Eddie in. She leads Rick to her small campsite, where she suddenly moves to attack him. He sidesteps her, and she instead chooses to commit suicide, stabbing herself in the stomach. Clara tells Rick she could not stand living without Eddie, who it is revealed has died and become a walker, and so she took his head with her. She pleads with Rick not to kill her, so she may remain with Eddie as a walker. Rick honors her dying wish and departs, and upon returning to the prison he discovers that Violet, the pig, has died of her illness. The supply run group returns to the prison. Maggie tells Glenn that she is not pregnant, as they had feared. Daryl informs Beth of Zach's death. She then resets the tally she was keeping of days without accidents. Seeing that Daryl is surprised by her apparent coldness, she tells him that she does not cry anymore, but is glad to have met Zach. Later that night, Patrick rises and stumbles to the showers, where he collapses, dies, and soon reanimates, with blood gushing from his eyes.

Astronauts who are stranded on a lunar mining base attempt to survive an attack by shapeshifting alien life forms. Filming was at the Canada Saskatchewan Production Studios by Regina, Saskatchewan based Minds Eye Entertainment. The film was one of the last financed by the province's cancelled film employment tax credit and was produced entirely in Saskatchewan.  Plot  Four isolated astronauts in the lunar mining base Ark suffer a meteor storm. While inspecting the damage caused by the meteors, astronaut Ava Cameron discovers spores contained in one of the fragments and brings them back to the base for investigation. The medical officer discovers that these spores can grow rapidly, and in the process Ava is contaminated with them. Shortly afterward, Ava shows evident signs of a rapidly progressing pregnancy and, a few hours later, she goes into labour. The life form escapes the lab, and none of the others believe Ava's stories; they instead attribute her pregnancy to a cyst. The alien stalks crew member Johns, eventually taking his shape and killing him. Using notes posthumously left by Johns, Ava and Col. Brauchman attempt to kill the alien before it can kill them. Eventually, Ava and Brauchman prepare to abandon the base in an escape pod, but it is hijacked by the alien. Ava and Brauchman, having expended most of the base's remaining power to ready the escape pod, are resigned to their fates until a rescue ship arrives from Earth. Brauchman sends a message to Earth from the rescue ship, warning them to kill whatever they discover in the escape pod, but it's revealed that the alien has escaped.  Cast  * Christian Slater as Col.

In an Electroencephalogram, these patterns generally resemble NREM slow-wave sleep, and oscillate between 'on' and 'off' periods in the same way that would be expected during an actual sleeping state. Local sleep can be induced by sustained and intense periods of activation of a particular brain region, especially when coupled with sleep deprivation (a condition colloquially called \\"sleep drunk\\"), although certain cortical regions of mice have been demonstrated to enter local sleep for very brief amounts of time without any immediate trigger. Unlike microsleep however, these brief periods of local sleep occur while the animal is still entirely conscious and functioning, although abilities associated with the specific brain region in local sleep tend to decline substantially. For instance, local sleep in brain regions associated with movement can lead to lapses in coordination, and more generally cognitive functioning seems to be somewhat impaired by local sleep of cortical regions, with mice undergoing cortical sleep exhibiting far less awareness of their surroundings and having delayed or inappropriate reactions to stimuli. While the function of local sleep is not definitively established, in at least one study the process has been shown to improve the performance of a task in mice. The mechanism behind this is suspected to be shared with the general mechanism driving learning and memory consolidation during sleep.

Telepharmacy is the delivery of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a pharmacist. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of telemedicine, as implemented in the field of pharmacy. Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for prescription drugs, and monitoring of formulary compliance with the aid of teleconferencing or videoconferencing. Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities. The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely. Benefits and drawbacks A primary appeal of telepharmacy is its potential to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care that could not be received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring, and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might no longer need to employ a full-time pharmacist. The potential costs of telepharmacy are broadly the same as those associated with all forms of telemedicine: potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that protected health information may be compromised through electronic information storage and transmission. Implementation The implementation of telepharmacy varies by region and jurisdiction. Factors including geography, laws and regulations, and economics influence its implementation. =Australia= A form of telepharmacy has been in use by Australia's Royal Flying Doctor Service since 1942. Medical chests containing medications and equipment are placed in remote communities where they can be administered to patients during a telehealth consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, Queensland recorded 21,470 telehealth consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a medical chest. The medication types administered most often are antibiotics, analgesics and gastrointestinal medications. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care. Another application of telepharmacy in Queensland has been the provision of pharmaceutical reviews in rural hospitals that lack on-staff pharmacists. Although broader use of telepharmacy could help alleviate a shortage of pharmacists, Australia has lagged the United States in its implementation of telepharmacy, partly because doctors, nurses, and other health care workers provide pharmacy services in rural and remote areas where there are no pharmacists. =United States= Implementation of telepharmacy in the United States began in the 2000s. A combination of factors, including changes in Medicare reimbursement for medications and the recession of 2007-8, led to a decline in the number of independent pharmacies in rural areas. In response to the need for alternative means of delivering pharmacy in services in rural communities lacking a full- time pharmacist, several midwestern and northwestern states with extensive rural areas have led much of the development of policy and implementation methods for telepharmacy. In 2001, North Dakota became the first U.S. state to pass regulations allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and hospital pharmacy sites throughout North Dakota. In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a central site communicates with remote site pharmacy technicians and patients through videoconferencing. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities, and a study of the operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably. The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states. The Community Health Association of Spokane, a network of community health centers in Spokane, Washington, started a telepharmacy program in 2001. The program delivers remote medication dispensing and health counseling to patients at six urban and rural clinics; remote site personnel are connected to pharmacists at the base site by videoconferencing. A survey found that most patients at the remote sites strongly agreed or agreed that they would have had difficulty affording their medications without this program. The Alaska Native Medical Center, a hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, providing telehealth services to Alaska Native populations, established a telepharmacy program in 2003 to improve its pharmaceutical services in rural native settlements. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists gave the program its 2006 Award for Excellence in Medication-Use Safety, concluding that the use of telepharmacy had improved access to pharmaceutical care and enabled pharmacists to monitor medication safety and encourage medication adherence, as well as making pharmacy care more cost-effective. The U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine operates a large-scale telepharmacy program for the use of service personnel. After piloting the program in 2006 at Naval Hospital Pensacola in Florida and Naval Hospital Bremerton in Washington, in 2010 the Navy expanded it to more sites throughout the world. This program represents the largest implementation of telepharmacy to date. California passed a Telehealth Advancement Act in 2011 to update the state's legal definitions of telehealth, simplify approval processes for telehealth services, and broaden the range of medical services that may be provided via telehealth. The law establishes legal parity between the direct and remote delivery of pharmacy care. Iowa's first telepharmacy opened in September 2012 after receiving a three-year waiver from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy that allows the facility to operate without a pharmacist on-site. A 2010 study of the various American states' rural health offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical facilities varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals. Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared to the spread of the basic technologies involved (internet access, audio/video compression algorithms, microphones and video cameras), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy. As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings. For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to protect patient medical information in compliance with HIPAA and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation. =Canada= Adoption of telepharmacy in Canada began as a response to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in Cranbrook, British Columbia, in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation. Remote dispensing machines for medication began operation in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes. As of 2009, a hospital in Ontario, Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on- site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful. =Other countries= After their success in Canada, remote medication dispensing machines were scheduled to be tested at several hospital locations in the United Kingdom beginning in 2010. In 2013, Maxor National Pharmacy Services, a U.S. company, reported that its remote dispensing machines for medication were being used in Bahrain, Belgium, Cuba, England, Germany, Guam, Italy, Japan, Spain and Venezuela. In 2010, Mannings drugstores became the first in Hong Kong to use videoconferencing to allow patients at outlets without full-time pharmacists to consult with pharmacists at other sites. In Malaysia, a health startup called Esyms provides a telepharmacy service that has a live chat and video feature which allows you to speak to a licensed pharmacist.

Starring Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, it tells the true story of Philomena Lee's 50-year search for her forcibly adopted son and Sixsmith's efforts to help her find him. It gained critical acclaim and received several international film awards. Coogan and Jeff Pope won Best Screenplay at the 70th Venice International Film Festival. It was also awarded the People's Choice Award Runner-Up prize at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.\\"TIFF 2013: 12 Years a Slave wins film fest's top prize\\". Toronto Star, 15 September 2013. The film was nominated in four categories at the 86th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay for Coogan and Pope, Best Actress for Dench, and Best Original Score for Desplat. It was also nominated for four BAFTA Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. Plot London-based journalist Martin Sixsmith has lost his job as a government adviser. He is approached at a party by the daughter of Philomena Lee. She suggests that he write a story about her mother, who was forced to give up her toddler son Anthony nearly fifty years ago. Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant to write a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case. In 1951, Philomena became pregnant and was sent by her father to Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea in Ireland. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the convent laundry for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years. Martin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for £1,000 each to wealthy Americans. Martin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed Michael A. Hess, who became a lawyer and senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years. Philomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael and learn more about him from them. They visit a former colleague of Michael's and discover that Michael was gay and died of AIDS. They also visit his sister Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent, and learn that they were both emotionally and physically abused by their adoptive parents, and hear about his partner Pete Olsson. After avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows Philomena some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, and had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and that they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery. Philomena and Martin go to the convent to ask them where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's efforts to stop him, Martin angrily breaks into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to a dying man and denying him the chance to finally reunite with his mother, purely out of self- righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of wedlock. Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. Philomena then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story. Philomena tells him to publish it anyway. Cast * Judi Dench as Philomena Lee * Steve Coogan as Martin Sixsmith * Michelle Fairley as Sally Mitchell * Barbara Jefford as Sister Hildegarde * Anna Maxwell Martin as Jane * Mare Winningham as Mary In addition to the main cast, Sophie Kennedy Clark plays a young Philomena, Kate Fleetwood plays a young Sister Hildegarde, Simone Lahbib plays Kate Sixsmith, Cathy Belton plays Sister Claire, Charlie Murphy plays Kathleen, Amy McAllister plays Sister Anunciata, Sean Mahon plays Michael, Philomena's son, and Peter Hermann plays Pete Olsson. Soundtrack The score of the film was composed by Alexandre Desplat. Reception =Critical response= Philomena received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 90% based on reviews from 198 critics, with an average rating of 7.74/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Based on a powerful true story and led by note-perfect performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena offers a profoundly affecting drama for adult filmgoers of all ages.\\" At Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on 42 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In The New York Times, Stephen Holden described the film as \\"so quietly moving that it feels lit from within.\\" He wrote: \\"That [Dench] makes you believe her character has the capacity to forgive provides the movie with a solid moral center.\\" He found the film's political viewpoint particularly sophisticated: Kelly Torrance of The Washington Times found that the film \\"ultimately feels false\\", with the filmmakers succumbing to the temptation to focus on the \\"lessons\\" the story holds at the expense of the human story itself. Justin Chang, of Variety, called the film a \\"smug but effective middlebrow crowdpleaser.\\" While noting Dench's \\"fine, dignified performance\\", he observed that much of the humor here comes at the expense of Dench's character. \\"[I]t's hard not to wonder if the writers are simply scoring points off [Philomena].\\" Rex Reed of The New York Observer gave the film a glowing review and named it the Best Film of 2013, saying: \\"It’s profoundly moving and thoroughly mind provoking, but despite the poignant subject matter, I promise you will not leave Philomena depressed. I've seen it twice and felt exhilarated, informed, enriched, absorbed and optimistic both times. This is filmmaking at its most refined. I will probably forget most of what happened at the movies in 2013, but I will never forget Philomena.\\" The New York Posts film critic Kyle Smith judged the film \\"another hateful and boring attack on Catholics.\\" He called it \\"90 minutes of organized hate\\" and wrote that: \\"A film that is half as harsh on Judaism or Islam, of course, wouldn't be made in the first place but would be universally reviled if it were.\\" Philomena Lee responded to Smith with an open letter that said: Producer Harvey Weinstein took out a full-page colour advertisement in The New York Times that quoted some favorable reviews and part of Smith's review accompanied by an excerpt from Lee's letter, and invited the public to make its own decision. Smith had accused several other films that were produced by Weinstein of anti-Catholicism, including The Magdalene Sisters (2002), The Butcher Boy (1998) and Priest (1995). =Box office= As of 7 May 2014, the film had grossed $100.1 million. =Awards= The film and its cast and crew have earned several award nominations, including four Academy Award nominations and four British Academy Film Award nominations. Dench and Coogan received nominations for Best Actress and Best Actor, respectively, at the British Independent Film Awards. Dench also garnered nominations for Best Actress from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, London Film Critics' Circle, Satellite Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Philomena garnered three nominations at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, and also won the David di Donatello for Best European Film. Historical authenticity The film employs artistic licence with the real- life events. The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 70.9% accurate when compared to real-life events due to \\"the (understandable) dramatic insertion of journalist Martin Sixsmith into the main plot line and big liberties with what Philomena actually knew and didn't know about her lost son\\". Philomena did not accompany Sixsmith to Washington to find her son, and her son’s partner was keen to meet her and flew to the UK where they met in Sixsmith’s house. Sister Hildegard McNulty, the principal antagonist in the film, is depicted as having met with journalist Sixsmith after he started working on the story. In reality, McNulty died in 1995, and Sixsmith only began his investigation in 2004. The final scene in which a wheelchair-bound McNulty chastises Philomena for carnality is also artistic licence. Sister Julie Rose, the order's assistant congregational leader, said: \\"“We do feel that the film, even though it is not a documentary, does not tell the whole truth and in many ways is very misleading.” A 2009 article by Martin Sixsmith said that in Ireland at the time the Catholic church forced unwed mothers in their care to give up their children for adoption.The Catholic church sold my child  Life and style, Martin Sixsmith, The Guardian, 19 September 2009, Retrieved on 22 May 2014. Sixsmith has said that Coogan's portrayal of him shared his \\"intolerance of injustice in all walks of life\\", and his admiration for a woman like Philomena who has the strength to rise above this. However, he is less angry than his on-screen version and is an agnostic rather than an atheist.

Written by a member of the Lisa and Mac teams, Steve Capps, it was one of the earliest video games on the Mac platform, part of the only games disk officially sold by Apple Computer during that era. In the game, the player takes the role of Alice from Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland, who is opposed by the computer playing a complete set of chess players. Alice moves about the board in realtime while attempting to capture the computer's pieces, while at the same time avoiding the computer's attempts to capturing her. To increase the skill level, Alice's moves are increasingly limited, while the computer increases the number of players it actively moves. The game was re-released for iOS on the 25th anniversary of the Mac's release. History In the fall of 1981 Steve Capps was a core member of the Lisa team working on printer support. In his spare time he wrote Alice on the Lisa and started demonstrating the game to members of the team. Bruce Daniels, manager of the Lisa software team, demoed the game to Andy Hertzfeld and other members of the Mac team. They were impressed, and Daniels suggested that a Mac port would be possible if the Mac team lent him a prototype to use for porting. Two days later, Capps returned with a working version. It soon became a favourite among the Mac team. Joanna Hoffman became particularly good at it, and complained that it was too easy. Capps changed several parts of the game to make it increasingly challenging. Steve Jobs saw the game and was duly impressed. He soon started agitating for Capps to join the Mac team, but as a key member of the Lisa team this was not possible. Jobs eventually arranged a deal that Capps could move after the Lisa was released, which occurred in January 1983. Capps became a key member of the Mac team, working on the Finder team and producing several pieces of early software, including the \\"Guided Tour\\" diskette that shipped with early machines. He continued making improvements to the game throughout this period as well. Several variations of the basic game appeared, including one where squares of the board would randomly disappear. This version was shown in the attract mode display for the game. By the fall of 1983, Capps was looking for routes to release the game commercially. The recently formed Electronic Arts was explored, but Jobs convinced Capps that Apple would do a better job of it. The game was featured during the release of the Mac in the spring of 1984. However, while progressing to commercial release, they discovered that the name \\"Alice\\" was being used by a database management program, so the name was changed to \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". Although not the first Mac game—the first Macintosh shipped with Puzzle, a built-in Desk Accessory—Through the Looking Glass remains the only game ever written and published directly by Apple, as opposed to the many games it resells. Apple was fighting the perception that the Mac was not a serious computer, and downplayed the game- playing aspects of the machine. Description Alice takes place on a conventional chess board, shown in exaggerated 3D perspective. The computer's players are initially laid out in normal chess fashion, at the \\"far end\\" of the board. During the new-game start up, one of each of the different pieces would travel down the board toward the player, lining up in front of them. Clicking on any one of the pieces started the game, with Alice being allowed to make the moves of the selected piece. The player moves Alice to any allowable position by clicking on the board. Alice initially moves like a queen, along the rank and file or diagonals. The game allows \\"click ahead\\", so the player can click on new positions while the on-screen character is still moving in response to earlier instructions. The player attempts to \\"capture\\" the computer's pieces by landing on them, just as in the case of a normal game of chess. The computer player initially moves a single player at a time, attempting to capture Alice, as well as aggressively promoting pawns for queening. The player scores points by capturing the computer's players, and loses points when the computer captures Alice. The game has several speed settings, which were described even by the author as \\"impossible\\" on the fastest setting.Steve Capps, \\"Through the Looking Glass (aka Alice)\\", Macintosh Garden, 3 May 2009 Selecting a different player at the start of the game, the pawn for instance, limits Alice's moves to provide an even greater difficulty. The game's settings and options were hidden, accessed by clicking on the score at the top of the screen. This caused an image of the Cheshire Cat to fade in over the board. Various settings were changed by clicking on different portions of the Cat. The game was packaged in a fabric covered box designed to look like a hardcover book. Opening the front cover revealed the instructions and diskette within, and the instructions printed on the inside cover. The disk also contained two other small programs written by Capps, an on-screen \\"Dali\\" clock program-cum-screensaver that morphed digits as the time changed, and Amazing, a program that built complex mazes and let the user solve them by dragging the mouse. Re-release For the 25th anniversary of the launch of the Mac, in 2009 Capps re-released the game as AliceX for iOS on the iTunes Store. The new version includes several different sets of pieces and other options. A simplified version written in JavaScript is available on Capps' web site, onedoto.

Origins As most of the citizens of London had either a near relation or friend in the army of the Earl of Essex, clergymen were getting overwhelmed with requests to include prayers for these soldiers in their Sunday services. So a group of them agreed to set aside an hour at 7 am, every morning, with half an hour for prayer and half an hour for a broader exhortation of the population. It was started by Thomas Case the Presbyterian minister at St. Mary Magdalen, Milk Street and continued there for a month. The exercises were then taken up by other churches across the City of London. Shortly after Westminster Abbey also started to host religious lectures between 6 - 8am, not only for local residents, but also for Members of Parliament. The preachers here included Edmund Staunton, Philip Nye, Stephen Marshall, Herbert Palmer, Charles Herle, Jeremiah Whitaker and Thomas Hill. At Cripplegate After the Civil War the Morning Exercises were continued, with many collected by Samuel Annesley being subsequently published in six volumes.

She is credited with working for reform of the public school system in Puerto Rico, and as one of the founders in 1917 of the Puerto Rican Feminine League and in 1921 of the Suffragist Social League.María de Fátima Barceló-Miller (1998). \\"Halfhearted Solidarity: Women Workers and the Women's Suffrage Movement in Puerto Rico During the 1920s\\", in Félix V. Matos Rodríguez ; Linda C. Delgado, Puerto Rican Women's History: New Perspectives, M. E. Sharpe. pp. 127-129, 131 Early life and education Carlota Matienzo Román was born in Barcelona, where her parents had met and married while her father was in law school. He was Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón from Puerto Rico. In the beginning of the 1880s, the family returned to Puerto Rico from Barcelona. They settled in Mayaguez, where her father built his law practice and became active in politics. In 1904 he was elected from the district as a member of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. In 1907, Carlota Matienzo graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, among the first generation of students after the university was founded. She subsequently went to New York City for graduate work, where she studied philosophy at Columbia University.Carmen Delgado Votaw, (1978). Puerto Rican Women: Some Biographical Profiles, National Conference of Puerto Rican Women. pp. 61 She returned to Puerto Rico to become a teacher. Career In her professional life, Matienzo worked on reform in the public school system in Puerto Rico in order to extend education to all classes of children. She also became active in other political issues. The Puerto Rican Feminine League, the first organization of its type to work for women's rights, was founded in 1917 by women of the \\"propertied, professional and intellectual elite\\", including Ana Roque de Duprey, Ángela Negrón Muñoz, and Matienzo, who were all teachers.Matías-Ortiz, Andrés (2001) Ambivalent Solidarities: Homeworkers, Needlework Unions, and the ILGWU in Puerto Rico, 1930-1940, University of Wisconsin-Madison, pp. 57 and 292 In this period women's rights groups were active throughout Latin America as well as in the United States. In 1921, Carlota Matienzo was one of the founders as the group changed its name to the Suffragist Social League and began to work directly for women's voting rights. Its members included medical doctors, writers and other intellectuals. She helped organize major conferences in San Juan, Ponce, Puerto Rico and Arecibo. She was among the leaders who took women's concerns to the legislature.Burgos Sasscer, Ruth; Rigau Ferrer, Eva (1978). La mujer marginada por la historia: ensayo, Ediciones Edil. pp. 138 After allying with the Popular Feminist Association of Working Women of Puerto Rico, the League supported universal suffrage.Yamila Azize (1985), La mujer en la lucha, Río Piedras: Editorial Cultural, pp. 137-138 Matienzo Román continued as one of the League's prominent members until 1924, when it divided into two organizations, split largely along grounds of political party affiliation of its leaders. Those who remained with the League favored the Pure Republican Party and the Republican- Socialist Coalition.Cabán, Pedro Ángel (1999) Constructing a Colonial People: Puerto Rico and the United States, 1898-1932, Westview Press, p. 282. The dissidents recruited members from the Union Party and Republican-Unionist Alliance. Matienzo Román next became a founding member of the Women's Aid Society of Puerto Rico. She worked directly to provide solutions to problems faced by women.Tirado de Delucca, Elba M.; Delucca Toledo, Jorge A. (1997).

In addition, it established the annual Carlota Matienzo Prize, which is awarded to graduates who demonstrate outstanding ability in teaching. *In the late 20th century, Matienzo was one of 999 women selected by American artist Judy Chicago for her installation, The Dinner Party (1979), premiered at the Brooklyn Museum.

This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena. Fields include computational economics, computational sociology, cliodynamics, culturomics, and the automated analysis of contents, in social and traditional media. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions through social simulation, modeling, network analysis, and media analysis.  Definitions  There are two terminologies that relate to each other: Social Science Computing (SSC) and Computational Social Science (CSS). In literature, CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena. On the other hand, SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations of social phenomena. Computational social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the scientific method: empirical research, especially through big data, by analyzing the digital footprint left behind through social online activities; and scientific theory, especially through computer simulation model building through social simulation.DT&SC; 7-1: .

It is considered one of the most important albums in the history of Israeli music. Background Poogy Tales is the debut album of Kaveret. The album is based on the rock opera by the same name that Danny Sanderson recorded in 1972, together with his bandmates from The Nahal Band (Gidi Gov, Alon Oleartchik, Efrahim Shamir, Miri Aloni, David Shanen and Tami Azaria). Gov, Oleartchik and Shamir went on to become members of Kaveret. Abraham (Deshe) \\"Fashanel\\" who signed the band and produced the album, suggested recording the opera as individual songs. Songs Most of the album's songs were written by Sanderson, with some help from other band members with lyrics and music. Most of the songs were characterized by nonsense, wordplay and surrealistic stories. The music was influenced by 1960s bands, especially The Beatles. The title track, \\"Shir HaMakolet\\" (The Grocery Song), the skit \\"Anshei HaAron\\" (People of the Closet) and the song \\"Lo Yad'anu Ma La'asot\\" (We Didn't Know What to Do), were taken from the rock opera. The song \\"HaMagafahim Shel Barukh\\" (Barukh's Boots) was taken from another rock opera named \\"HaYeled MiBrazil\\" (The Child from Brazil). \\"Yosi, Ma Nishma\\" (What's up, Yosi?) is an instrumental track composed by Sanderson in order to teach Yehuda Adar how to play the guitar. The song \\"BaYom U'VaLaila\\" (At Day and Night) was written by Sanderson as \\"The Cold Shoulder\\" at the age of 15 with his friend, Melisa Konel and originally performed by the duo with their band \\"The Catacombs\\". The song \\"Yeled Mizdaqen\\" (A Boy Growing Old) was based on an Army Radio skit named \\"Poogy Mitkhashmel\\" (Poogy gets electrocuted). Alon Oleartchik claimed that the music was too beautiful to be wasted on a skit, so he wrote serious lyrics that stand apart from the rest of the album. The songs \\"Yo Ya\\" and \\"Po Qavur HaKelev\\" (Here Lies the Dog/Therein lies the rub) are based on the double meaning of Hebrew proverbs and make use of unexpected meanings of certain sayings. The album's artwork was created by Itamar Neumann, a friend of Sanderson. Reception Poogy Tales was released in late 1973, after the Yom Kippur War. Before the war, the songs \\"Po Qavur HaKelev\\" and \\"Sherut Atzmi\\" (Self Service) did not get much radio play, and the band's humor did not always come across. Later, the album became a huge success both critically and commercially. The lighthearted and humorous tone of Poogy Tales appealed to the Israeli public after the trauma of the war, and the band's performances among reservists were also a great success. Kaveret concerts soon became a hit and approximately 70,000 albums were sold during the first year after its release. By the end of the 1980s, Poogy's Tales had sold more than 140,000 albums, making it one of the best-selling albums in the history of Israeli music. The songs \\"HaMagafaim Shel Barukh\\" (chosen as song of the year by Army Radio and Kol Yisrael), \\"Shir HaMakolet\\" (No. 3 on the Army Radio hits chart), \\"Yeled Mizdaqen\\", \\"Po Qavur HaKelev\\" and \\"Yo Ya\\" were all successful on the radio. The band was chosen as \\"band of the Year\\" by Kol Yisrael. After the album A year after the release of Poogy Tales, Kaveret released their second studio album, Poogy in a Pita, which was also a great success. in 1989, Poogy Tales was re-released by the label \\"Hed Artzi\\" including new 5 bonus tracks that weren't included in the original release. The bonus tracks are a cover of the classic \\"Haiu Leilot\\" ('There Were Some Nights') in a rehearsal, and the humorous skits \\"Matemat'iqa\\" ('Mathematics') and \\"Shi'ur Psanter\\" ('Piano Lesson') that were recorded by Sanderson, Gov and Meir Fenigstein. \\"Yo ya\\" was covered by the Australian punk band Yidcore in 2005 for that band's second album Eighth Day Slice. In 2013, for the 40th anniversary for the album, the band reunited for the fourth time since its break up in 1976. In honor of the reunion, Israeli musicians and bands such as Mercedes Band, Kerach 9 and others performed cover versions of songs from the album as part of a special Army Radio project.

It is the opposite of the analogy. When analogy is allowed, e contrario is forbidden and vice versa. Arguments e contrario are often used in the legal system as a way to solve problems not currently covered by a certain system of laws. Although it might be used as a logical fallacy, arguments e contrario are not by definition fallacies. In law, the use of the argumentum e contrario finds its footing in the Latin maxim: ubicumque lex voluit dixit, ubi tacuit noluit that runs as follows: If the Legislator wished to say something, he would do that expressly. Legal examples *\\"§ 123 of the X-Law says that green cars need to have blue tires. Therefore, red cars don't have to have blue tires.\\" : Here the argument is based on the fact that red cars are not green cars and therefore § 123 of the X-Law cannot be applied to them. This requires the law to be interpreted to determine which solution would have been desired if the lawmaker had considered red cars. In this case it's probably safe to assume that they only wanted to regulate green cars and not regulate cars of other colors. On the other hand, this example: *\\"§ 456 of the Y-Law says that it's irrelevant whether a message is sent by letter or by telegraph. Therefore, messages cannot be sent by fax machines.\\" : As with the example above, the argument is based on the fact that the law does not mention something (in this case, faxes), but leaps to the interpretation that they must therefore not be used. Here, the belief that lawmakers intentionally excluded fax machines is less reasonable than the assumption that fax machines did not exist at this time and that, were the law passed today, they would have been mentioned. Here the e contrario argument is used fallaciously in two ways: it places the letter of the law above its intent, and mistakes a time, place, and manner law letters and telegraphs, for a law only letters and telegraphs, which is it not. Novel legal cases often hinge on more cogent arguments of the form: *\\"§§ 455–457 of the Y-Law specifically cover messages sent by letter or by telegraph, and do not mention fax machines or electronic mail, and thus cannot be held to apply to either of the latter.\\" : Depending upon the intent and scope of the law, it may be held by the court to apply to the previously unaccounted-for situation by analogy, or to not apply because the cases are insufficiently analogous, such that a legislative change to the law's wording would be required for such an expansion of scope. Cases raising such questions are increasingly common as technology introduces capabilities that are somewhat but not exactly analogous to those provided by older technologies. A high-profile example of the use of argumentum e contrario (rejected by the court) in such a case is Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service.

His win in the 2012 Florida Derby saw him regarded as a contender for the Triple Crown races, but an injury sustained in the Kentucky Derby ruled him out for most of the remainder of the season. As a four-year-old in 2013 he won the Alysheba Stakes but later that summer suffered a condylar fracture in the Monmouth Cup, which required surgery, but ended his racing career and his owners, WinStar Farm, retired him to stud. Background Take Charge Indy is a dark bay or brown horse with a white star bred by Eaton Sales of Lexington, Kentucky. His sire A.P. Indy won the Belmont Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Classic in 1992 before going on to become a successful breeding stallion: his other progeny include Bernardini, Friesan Fire, Mineshaft, Pulpit and Rags to Riches. Take Charge Indy's dam, Take Charge Lady, was a top-class racemare whose wins included the Ashland Stakes and successive runnings of the Spinster Stakes. She is also the dam of the Travers Stakes winner Will Take Charge. As a yearling, Take Charge Indy was consigned to the Keeneland Sales in September, but failed to find a buyer willing to pay the $80,000 reserve price. The colt was sent into training with the British-born Patrick Byrne, whose other successful horses have included Awesome Again and Favorite Trick. Take Charge Indy usually races in a set of black blinkers. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= Throughout his two-year-old season, which began on July 30, 2011, Take Charge Indy was ridden by James Graham. On his debut, the colt recorded a six and a half length win a maiden race on the Polytrack surface at Arlington Park. At the same track on September 10, he was moved up in class to contest the Grade III Arlington-Washington Futurity and was made the 12/5 favorite against twelve opponents. He took the lead in the straight but was overtaken 75 yards from the finish and beaten a length by Shared Property. In October, Take Charge Indy competed at Grade I level for the first time in the Dixiana Breeders' Futurity at Keeneland and finished fourth of the thirteen runners behind Dullahan. On his final appearance of the year, Take Charge Indy started a 33/1 outsider in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs on November 5. He finished fifth of the thirteen runners behind Hansen, Union Rags, Creative Cause and Dullahan. =2012: three-year- old season= In 2012, Calvin Borel took over from Graham as Take Charge Indy's regular jockey. The colt began his season at Gulfstream Park in January, when he finished second to El Padrino in an allowance race over one and one sixteenth of a mile. The colt did not race again for months, with Byrne controversially withdrawing his charge from the Tampa Bay Derby after receiving an unfavorable outside draw. Take Charge Indy reappeared in the Grade I Florida Derby at Gulfstream and started at odds of 7.7/1 for a race in which his rivals included Union Rags (the 2/5 favorite) and El Padrino. Borel sent the colt into the lead after 150 yards and led the field until being headed by Reveron with a quarter mile to run. Take Charge Indy quickly regained the lead, broke two lengths clear, and held on to win by a length from Reveron, with Union Rags in third. After the race Borel expressed his confidence in the winner, saying: \\"This horse, he has the potential, he has the breeding behind him. Pat's been to the big dance, so he wasn’t coming to play, I’ll tell you that.\\" On May 5, 2012, Take Charge Indy was one of twenty colts to contest the 138th Kentucky Derby over a mile and a quarter at Churchill Downs. Starting from stall 3 he was made the 11.9/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Bodemeister, Union Rags and Gemologist. He raced just behind the leaders but began to weaken before the stretch and finished tailed off last of the nineteen finishers, more than fifty lengths behind the winner I'll Have Another. Borel at first believed that the colt had bled during the race, but subsequent veterinary examination revealed that he had chipped a bone in his left front ankle. He underwent surgery at Woodford Equine Hospital in Versailles, Kentucky and was forced to miss most of the season's remaining major races. During his break from racing a half-share in Take Charge Indy was bought by the Versailles-base Winstar Farm. After five and a half months off the track, Take Charge Indy returned to action on October 27 in the Grade II Fayette Stakes over a mile and one eighth at Keeneland, where he was matched against older horses for the first time. He finished third of the ten runners behind the four-year-old colt Newsdad and the five-year-old gelding Nikki's Sandcastle. On his final start of the year, Take Charge Indy started at odds of 5.8/1 for the Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs on November 23. Under a weight of 117 pounds he finished second, beaten a length by the 2011 Preakness Stakes winner Shackleford (119). =2013: four-year-old season= Take Charge Indy began his third season in the Grade I Donn Handicap at Gulfstream on February 9, 2013 when he finished third, beaten eight lengths by the Graydar, who led from the start. In March, at the same track, he finished second to Cigar Street in the Grade III Skip Away Stakes over ten and a half furlongs. Take Charge Indy had gone over a year since his last win when he contested the Grade II Alysheba Stakes at Churchill Downs on May 3. Ridden by Rosie Napravnik he carried 120 pounds and started at odds of 14/5 against eight opponents. He won easily by six lengths in a time of 1:41.41 from the subsequently disqualified favorite Cyber Secret, with Hymn Book in third. After the race Byrne said: \\"We finally got a nice big race out of him... he has that natural speed. He'll wait and do whatever you want\\". On June 16, Take Charge Indy was made favorite for the Stephen Foster Handicap but after racing in second place he faded in the closing stages and finished last of the six runners behind Fort Larned. On July 28, in the Grade II Monmouth Cup, at Monmouth Park Racetrack, Take Charge Indy was the favorite and led down the backstretch. However, his jockey heard a \\"big pop\\" and quickly pulled him up. The horse was vanned off the track and x-rays showed he had a left front condylar fracture and would require surgical repair. Following a successful operation at the Hogan Equine clinic, where three screws where inserted into the horse's leg, it was announced that Take Charge Indy had been retired and would begin stallion duties at WinStar in 2014. Pedigree *Take Charge Indy is inbred 3 × 4 to Secretariat, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

He was known for his presentation at the Black Hat computer security conference in 2010, during which he exploited two ATMs and made them dispense fake paper currency on the stage. Among his other most notable works were the exploitation of various medical devices, including pacemakers and insulin pumps. Jack was renowned among industry experts for his influence in the medical and financial security fields. In 2012 his testimony led the United States Food And Drug Administration to change regulations regarding wireless medical devices. At the time of his death, Jack was the Director of Embedded Device Security at IOActive. \\"Jackpotting\\" ATMs At a Black Hat conference in 2010, Jack gave a presentation on \\"jackpotting\\", or causing automated teller machines to dispense cash without withdrawing it from a bank account using a bank card. The scenario was first described in fiction in the 1995 cyberpunk movie Hackers. Jack gave demonstrations of different kinds of attacks involving both physical access to the machines and completely automated remote attacks. In both cases, malware was injected into the operating system of the machines, causing them to dispense currency fraudulently on the attacker's command. During the physical attack on an automated teller machine (ATM) as demonstrated by Jack, the attacker takes advantage of their physical access to the target machine and uses a flash drive loaded with malware to gain unauthorised access to the machines allowing control over their currency dispensing mechanism. During the remote attack, malware is installed onto the target system via exploited vulnerabilities in the remote management system, most notably the use of default passwords and remote management TCP ports. The attacker then executes the malware, causing the target ATM to dispense currency. Insulin pumps At the McAfee FOCUS 11 conference in October 2011 in Las Vegas, while working for McAfee Security, Jack first demonstrated the wireless hacking of insulin pumps, one worn by a diabetic friend and another of the same model on a bench set up for demonstration. Interfacing with the pumps with a high-gain antenna, he obtained complete control of the pumps without any prior knowledge of their serial numbers, up to being able to cause the demonstration pump to repeatedly deliver its maximum dose of 25 units until its entire reservoir of 300 units was depleted, amounting to many times a lethal dose if delivered to a typical patient. At the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco in February 2012, using a transparent mannequin he demonstrated that he could wirelessly hack the insulin pump from a distance of up to 90 metres using the high-gain antenna. Pacemakers In 2012 Jack demonstrated the ability to assassinate a victim by hacking their pacemaker. This scenario was first explored in fiction on the TV series Homeland. In his blog post \\"Broken Hearts\\", Jack wrote that the hack was even easier than portrayed: \\"TV is so ridiculous! You don't need a serial number!\\" Jack demonstrated delivering such a deadly electric shock live at the 2012 BreakPoint security conference in Melbourne. In the game Watch Dogs, a similar hack is shown by black hat Aiden Pearce in killing one of the main antagonists. Heart implants Jack died a week before he was to give a presentation on hacking heart implants at the Black Hat 2013 conference scheduled to be held in Las Vegas. In a June 2013 interview with Vice, Jack outlined his presentation: > Barnaby Jack, the director of embedded device security for computer security > firm IOActive, developed software that allowed him to remotely send an > electric shock to anyone wearing a pacemaker within a 50-foot radius. He > also came up with a system that scans for any insulin pumps that communicate > wirelessly within 300 feet, allows you to hack into them without needing to > know the identification numbers and then sets them to dish out more or less > insulin than necessary, sending patients into hypoglycemic shock quickly if > excessive insulin was dispensed or ketoacidosis if not enough insulin was > dispensed over a period of time. In his presentation, Jack was set to outline vulnerabilities in various medical devices, as well as give safe demonstrations of attacks with which there is \\"certainly a potential health risk\\". Death Jack was found dead in a San Francisco apartment on 25 July 2013 by his girlfriend. According to the coroner's report, Jack died of an overdose of heroin, cocaine, Benadryl and Xanax. He was 35 years old. At the time of his death, he was due to attend a Black Hat Briefings hacking conference in Las Vegas. Black Hat general manager Trey Ford, said \\"Everyone would agree that the life and work of Barnaby Jack are legendary and irreplaceable\\", and announced his spot would not be replaced at the conference. In popular culture Barnaby Jack's \\"Jackpotting\\" technique of an ATM and multiple ATMs being hacked and forced to spit out any amount of cash triggered by a number of events all described in Jack's 2010 Black Hat presentation, was used as the plot line in the 20th of December 2015 episode of series 2 of the CBS crime drama CSI: Cyber. Apart from showing the hack in use and explaining how it works, the episode also included other nods to Barnaby Jack and his work including naming the hacked bank \\"Barnaby Bank\\". The CSI spinoff focused on a team of FBI agents and ex-blackhat hackers working to stop various cyber threats across the US.

It is Angelou's first collection of poetry published after she read her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. It contains her previous five books of poetry, published between 1971—1990. Her prose works have been more successful than her poetry, which has received little serious attention by critics. History The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou is Maya Angelou's first collection of poetry. By the time of its publication in 1994, she had published five autobiographies, eventually going on to publish seven, and five books of poetry. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Her publisher, Random House, placed the poems of her previous volumes in this collection, perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. The volumes included in the collection are Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975), And Still I Rise (1978), Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983), and I Shall Not Be Moved (1990). Also included was \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\". Angelou's publisher placed four previously-published poems in a smaller volume, entitled Phenomenal Woman in 1995. Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993 Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age. After her rape at the age of eight, as recounted in her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness. Angelou considered herself a playwright and poet when her editor Robert Loomis challenged her to write Caged Bird, but she has been best known for her autobiographies. Many of her readers identify her as a poet first and an autobiographer second, but like Lynn Z. Bloom, many critics consider her autobiographies more important than her poetry.Bloom, Lynn Z. (1985). \\"Maya Angelou\\". In Dictionary of Literary Biography African American Writers after 1955, Vol. 38. Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Company, pp. 10–11. Critic William Sylvester has stated that although her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has \\"received little serious critical attention\\". Bloom also believes that Angelou's poetry is more interesting when she recites them. Bloom calls her performances \\"characteristically dynamic\\", and says that Angelou \\"moves exuberantly, vigorously to reinforce the rhythms of the lines, the tone of the words.

When the Lufthansa airplane was seized by sympathisers of the Black September Organization during the Beirut-Ankara part of a multi-stopover flight from Damascus to Frankfurt, the West German authorities complied with the demand of having the prisoners released. They were handed over at Zagreb Airport, and the hijacked aircraft was flown to Tripoli, where all hostages were released. The liberated Munich attackers were granted asylum by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. For its actions, the West German government was criticised by Israel and other parties. In some cases allegations were made that the hijacking had been staged or at least tolerated with theories of a secret agreement between the German government and Black September - release of the surviving terrorists in exchange for assurances of no further attacks on Germany. Background: The Olympic hostage crisis and its aftermath On 5 September 1972, during the Munich Summer Olympics, eight members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September took nine members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage, after killing two other Israeli athletes. During a shoot-out following a failed police rescue attempt at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, all hostages were killed. Five of the eight Palestinian attack team were also killed. The three surviving perpetrators were Adnan Al-Gashey, Jamal Al- Gashey, and Mohammed Safady, who were arrested and held in pre-trial custody. In the immediate aftermath of the Munich massacre, West German authorities were concerned over being drawn into the Arab–Israeli conflict. As foreign minister Walter Scheel put it in October 1972, one had to \\"defend against actions by both sides of the conflict\\". In Israel, the ensuing German appeasement politics led to comparisons with the 1938 Munich Agreement. Indeed, since Willy Brandt had become chancellor in 1969, there had been a change of the West German attitude towards the Arab–Israeli conflict. The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with the Six-Day War), which had resulted in a number of Arab states breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany. With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics. The West German authorities were aware of the high profile of the prisoners and the fact that the group had numerous sympathisers, so that terrorist acts aiming at the liberation of the Munich attackers were feared. Aircraft of (then) national airline Lufthansa or its Israeli counterpart El Al were identified as likely targets. On 9 September, an anonymous letter was received claiming that such a hijacking was indeed imminent, which prompted the Federal Ministry of the Interior (then led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher) to consider whether citizens of Arab states should be denied boarding of Lufthansa flights. Already during the Munich hostage crisis, it had become evident that the attackers were aware of possible liberation attempts in case of their arrest. Asked if he was afraid of being caught and put into a German prison, their leader Luttif Afif (who was later killed in the Fürstenfeldbruck shoot-out) had responded that there was nothing to fear, because \\"there is no death penalty in Germany, and our brothers would liberate us.\\" The hijacking :Note: For consistency reasons, all times have been converted to Central European Time. On 29 October 1972 (a Sunday), a Lufthansa Boeing 727-100 was hijacked: Flight 615 on the Damascus-Beirut-Ankara-Munich- Frankfurt route. The aircraft (registered had originated at Damascus International Airport in the early morning, with seven crew members but initially without any passengers. At the first stopover at Beirut International Airport, 13 people boarded the flight: nine citizens of unknown Arab countries, two Americans, one German, and one Frenchman; and moreover a Spanish journalist letting an eyewitness account of the events. Departure from Beirut was delayed by about one hour. Originally scheduled to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened to blow up the aircraft using explosives that had been hidden in the first class cabin (and which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of Black September were not released from the German prison. Following a fuel stop at Nicosia International Airport, the pilots were forced to fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers initially had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb in what was then the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, circling over Zagreb Airport until the Black September members had been brought there. This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel. Once word of the hijacking was received at the Lufthansa headquarters in Cologne, chairman Herbert Culmann boarded a corporate Hawker Siddeley HS.125 owned by then subsidiary Condor (registered D-CFCF) and flew to Munich, where he joined mayor Georg Kronawitter and police chief Manfred Schreiber (de) as well as the Bavarian interior minister Bruno Merk (de) at the local crisis committee. The West German governmental response was coordinated by a crisis council in Bonn, which comprised vice chancellor and foreign minister Walter Scheel and the ministers of the interior and of transportation, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Lauritz Lauritzen. Recalling the failed rescue attempt during the Olympic hostage crisis and the (then) lack of a special operations police unit such as the later GSG 9, the West German authorities quickly decided to comply with the demands of the hijackers. By 14:00, the three Black September members had been transported to Riem Airport. Philipp Held (de), the Bavarian minister for justice, ordered for the revocation of the arrest warrant and had them issued official emigration papers. The three were brought on board the airplane Culmann had used to get to Munich, where they were joined by two plain clothes police officers. Culmann himself offhandedly decided to also head to Zagreb in order to directly assist the negotiations there. The airplane with the released prisoners left Munich, but the pilot had been ordered to stay inside West German airspace until further notice. The German negotiators hoped for the concession that the hijacked Lufthansa jet would be allowed to first land at Zagreb, which turned out to be futile. The situation tensed when the hijacked Lufthansa aircraft came dangerously close to the point of fuel starvation. In what he later called a \\"state of emergency\\" due to an alleged loss of communications with Munich, Lufthansa chairman Culmann personally ordered the pilot of the aircraft carrying the released Munich attackers to head towards and land at Zagreb Airport, thus acting against orders by higher authorities. As a consequence, a legal investigation against Culmann was initiated, but abandoned shortly thereafter. Twenty minutes after the three Black September members had arrived at Zagreb Airport, the hijacked Lufthansa jet also landed there and some time later, at 18:05, the handing-over took place. This happened without any reciprocal measures: The 18 hostages were not released yet. Another critical situation unfolded when the Yugoslav authorities in charge of the airport complied with the demands of their counterparts in Bonn and prevented the Lufthansa jet from taking off again. Realizing that the plane would not be refueled, the hijackers again threatened to kill everyone on board. The standoff was broken by Kurt Laqueur (de), the West German consul in Zagreb, who signed the refueling order without having been authorized to do so, thus allowing the Lufthansa jet to depart at 18:50, this time heading for Tripoli. At 21:03, it arrived at Tripoli International Airport, where the hostages were finally set free. In Libya and other countries of the region, mass celebrations erupted, with the Lufthansa hijackers and the liberated Munich perpetrators being treated as heroes. Right after their arrival at the airport, a press conference was held, which was broadcast live around the world. The Libyan government led by Muammar Gaddafi allowed the Munich attackers to take refuge and go into hiding, ignoring the demands of West German foreign minister Scheel to put them on trial. In a large scale covert operation dubbed Wrath of God, Israel would subsequently aim at them being tracked down and killed. Reactions German politicians of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) as well as the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non- violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers having left the country, the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others. Israel sharply condemned the release of the Munich perpetrators and accused West Germany of having \\"capitulated to terrorism\\". Prime Minister Golda Meir stated on the following day: \\"We have been depressed since yesterday, aggrieved and I would say insulted, that the human spirit, so weak and helpless, has surrendered to brutal force.\\" Foreign Minister Abba Eban filed an official protest note with the West German government, and the Israeli ambassador in Bonn was temporarily called back, officially due to consultations. Allegations of a West German government involvement In the immediate aftermath of the hijacking of Flight 615 as well as on a number of later occasions, concerns were voiced that the event might have been staged or at least tolerated by the West German government in order to \\"get rid of three murderers, which had become a security burden\\" (as Amnon Rubinstein wrote in Israeli newspaper Haaretz under the headline \\"Bonn's Disgrace\\" shortly after the prisoner release). Arguments frequently brought forth to back such allegations are the \\"suspiciously\\" low passenger number (there were only 13 male passengers on board the hijacked Boeing , an aircraft type with a seating capacity of 130–150), the \\"surprisingly\\" quick decision to have the prisoners released, as well as purported contacts of the West German Federal Intelligence Service to the Palestine Liberation Organization. The West German trade interests in the Arab countries as well as the desire to be spared from future acts of terror were alleged as motives for a government involvement. Shortly after the events surrounding Flight 615, Haim Yosef Zadok accused West Germany in a Knesset speech of having \\"used the opportunity to improve its relations to the Arab world.\\" In his 1999 autobiography, Abu Daoud (the mastermind behind the Munich massacre) claims that he had been offered $9 million by \\"the Germans\\" for faking the prisoner release. In later years, he refused to repeat or elaborate this allegation, though. In a 2006 interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Zvi Zamir, the head of Mossad from 1968 to 1974, states that he was certain that there had been some kind of an agreement between West Germany and Black September. The Oscar-winning documentary film One Day in September (which was released in 1999 and deals with the Munich massacre) supports the thesis that the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 615 was \\"a set-up, organized by the German government in collusion with the terrorists,\\"Quotations taken from the documentary film One Day in September. which corresponds to remarks by Jamal Al-Gashey about the aftermath of his liberation. The film features an interview with Ulrich Wegener, a German counter-terrorism expert and founding commander of GSG 9, who calls such allegations \\"probably true\\". Wegener is also quoted with the opinion that considerations of the West German authorities on how to deal with the hostage situation had likely been mainly driven by the desire to prevent the country from becoming the focus for further acts of terror. In 2013, investigative journalists of German television programme Report München (de) cited from a letter by the Munich police chief, which had been sent to the Bavarian interior ministry eleven days prior to the hijacking of Flight 615. It describes measures that had been taken in order to \\"accelerate the deportation\\" of the Munich attackers, rather than preparing for them to be put on trial. As a counter-argument to accusations of a pre-arranged prisoner release, deficits in planning and communications that the German negotiators had encountered during the hostage crisis have been cited. The situation had been chaotic and confusing at times, which lets it seem unlikely that it was scripted. LH 615 – Operation München (de), a 1975 documentary feature produced by Bayerischer Rundfunk, attributes the non-violent outcome of the hijacking to Lufthansa chairman Culmann and consul Laqueur: They had acted on their own terms rather than obeying orders by governmental officials.

It is named after the initials of its five inventors, Peter Shor, Shlomo Moran, Alok Aggarwal, Robert Wilber, and Maria Klawe.. Input For the purposes of this algorithm, a matrix is defined to be monotone if each row's minimum value occurs in a column which is equal to or greater than the column of the previous row's minimum. It is totally monotone if the same property is true for every submatrix (defined by an arbitrary subset of the rows and columns of the given matrix). Equivalently, a matrix is totally monotone if there does not exist a 2×2 submatrix whose row minima are in the top right and bottom left corners. Every Monge array is totally monotone, but not necessarily vice versa. For the SMAWK algorithm, the matrix to be searched should be defined as a function, and this function is given as input to the algorithm (together with the dimensions of the matrix). The algorithm then evaluates the function whenever it needs to know the value of a particular matrix cell. If this evaluation takes O(1), then, for a matrix with r rows and c columns, the running time and number of function evaluations are both O(c(1 + log(r/c))). This is much faster than the O(r c) time of a naive algorithm that evaluates all matrix cells. Method The basic idea of the algorithm is to follow a prune and search strategy in which the problem to be solved is reduced to a single recursive subproblem of the same type whose size is smaller by a constant factor. To do so, the algorithm first preprocesses the matrix to remove some of its columns that cannot contain a row-minimum, using a stack-based algorithm similar to the one in the Graham scan and all nearest smaller values algorithms. After this phase of the algorithm, the number of remaining columns will at most equal the number of rows. Next, the algorithm calls itself recursively to find the row minima of the even-numbered rows of the matrix. Finally, by searching the columns between the positions of consecutive even- row minima, the algorithm fills out the remaining minima in the odd rows. Applications The main applications of this method presented in the original paper by Aggarwal et al. were in computational geometry, in finding the farthest point from each point of a convex polygon, and in finding optimal enclosing polygons. Subsequent research found applications of the same algorithm in breaking paragraphs into lines, RNA secondary structure prediction,. DNA and protein sequence alignment,.. the construction of prefix codes,. and image thresholding,. among others.

He spent the next 30 years at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its successor, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where his area of speciality was control of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. In 2004, he was appointed Director of the Department for Security and Disarmament. On 2 February 2011, he was promoted by a Presidential Decree to become Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation. As Deputy Minister of Defense, he was personally sanctioned by the European Union following Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.

The type species Canardia garonnensis was first described and named by Albert Prieto- Márquez, Fabio M. Dalla Vecchia, Rodrigo Gaete and Àngel Galobart in 2013. The name of the genus comes from “canard”, the French word for “duck”, an allusion to the fact that this animal belongs to the hadrosaurids which are also known as duck-billed dinosaurs. The specific epithet garonnensis refers to the Haute-Garonne department where this dinosaur has been found. Canardia was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs and lived between 67,5 and 66 my on the former Ibero-Armorican Island, which included much of France and Spain. Discovery and naming The Larcan specimen (a right maxilla and quadrate) of Canardia found about 1 m under an iridium level marking the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Canardia is known by various cranial and postcranial remains found in several sites in southwestern France (Haute-Garonne Department). The type locality of Tricouté 3, near the village of Marignac-Laspeyres, was discovered in 1999 by a team of The Musée des Dinosaures d’Espéraza. This site is located in the basal part of the Marnes d’Auzas Formation, which corresponds to a laguno-continental environment. The hadrosaur remains were preserved in a small lenticular marly-sandstone level within a thick sandstone bed. They belong to at least two different individuals as indicated by the presence of two left scapulae among the samples. The cranial elements include a nearly complete right maxilla (the holotype), a partial left maxilla, a right prefrontal, an incomplete right postorbital, a left quadrate, a right pterygoid, a partial left surangular, a right articular, an isolated dentary tooth crown, and a partial dental battery of the lower jaw. The postcranial material is represented by two partial left scapulae, an incomplete left sternal plate, a left humerus, and a partial right pubis. In 2003, these specimens were provisionally attributed to Pararhabdodon sp., a Spanish genus that at the time was the only known lambeosaurin in Europe. It was not until 2013 that Prieto-Márquez and colleagues recognized these bones as those of a new genus. All bones are of relatively small sizes (the holotype maxilla is 16,9 cm, the scapula is 21,8 cm, and the humerus is only 19,4 cm) and belong to immature individuals. The same authors have also attributed to Canardia an associated maxilla and quadrate found in marine deposits of the Marly Limestone of Gensac Formation in Larcan quarry, about twenty km west of Marignac-Laspeyres. The two bones, first described in 2010 by Bilotte et al., were located approximately 1 m under an iridium level marking the Cretaceous- Paleogene boundary. This level is a lateral equivalent to the uppermost part of the Marne d’Auzas Formation. This shows that the Larcan individual is geologically younger than the Marignac-Laspeyres specimens. This discovery also indicates that Canardia was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist in Europe just before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The Larcan specimen belongs to a juvenile individual (the length of the maxilla is 11,5 cm), whose remains were carried by a river to the sea. Description Canardia garonnensis. Part of the dental battery of the lower jaw in occlusal (A) and lingual (B) views. Details of the crowns of the same specimens (C, E) and of an isolated dentary tooth (D). The main feature of Canardia is the maxilla characterized by an enlarged rostrodorsal region that forms a prominent subrectangular flange that rises vertically above the rostroventral process. This character is also known in Aralosaurus tuberiferus from Kazakhstan that lived 20 million years before Canardia. However, the maxilla of Canardia differs from that of Aralosaurus in its subhorizontal ectopterygoid shelf (it is parallel to the posterior segment of the dental row) whereas it is clearly inclined in Aralosaurus. The maxilla of Canardia shows at least 26 teeth positions against 30 in Aralosaurus, but the entire tooth row is not preserved in the French form. The maxillary teeth have a single median carina while the dentary teeth have an accessory ridge in front of the sub-central carina, as is the case in Aralosaurus and in many other hadrosaurs. Canardia differs also from Aralosaurus by the shape of the prefrontal in dorsal view. In Canardia, the rostroventral process of the prefrontal is rostrocaudally narrow, whereas in Aralosaurus, the same bone process is broad and laterally well-exposed. In addition, the prefrontal of Canardia has a dorsomedial flange that is absent in Aralosaurus. Canardia and Aralosaurus are closely related, and Prieto-Márquez and colleagues brought them together in a new group of basal lambeosaurines which they call Aralosaurini. It is not known if Canardia had a hollow bony crest on the skull like most lambeosaurines. Its close relative Aralosaurus appears to have had a hollow structure in front of the orbits. However, as only a fragment of this structure has been preserved, its size and shape are unfortunately unknown. Maybe Canardia had a similar structure, but the discovery of more complete cranial remains is necessary to make comparisons.  Phylogeny  With its sister group Aralosaurus tuberiferus, Canardia garonnensis form a small clade, the tribe of Aralosaurini. These two genera are the most basal Lambeosaurinae. The phylogenetic analyzes carried out by Prieto-Márquez and his colleagues led to the following cladogram: Palaeoecology =Paleobiogeography= Appendicular bones of Canardia. Left Scapula in lateral view (A). Left sternal plate in ventrolateral view (B). Distal blade of left scapula in lateral view (C). Fragmentary right pubis in lateral view (D). Left humerus in medial (E), rostral (F), and lateral (G) views. The close relationship of Canardia with Aralosaurus confirms the existence of faunal exchange in the Late Cretaceous between the islands of the European archipelago and the Asian continent. Canardia and Aralosaurus are temporally distant for at least 20 million years. As no lambeosaurines were known in the rich localities of late Campanian and early Maastrichtian ages of the Ibero-Armorican Island, it was suggested that the ancestors of Canardia had to reach this island rather late, perhaps at the end of the early Maastrichtian or during the late Maastrichtian. The discovery later in Spain of numerous lambeosaurines remains in the highest levels of the lower Maastrichtian argues for the first hypothesis. This migration was probably carried out in several stages, firstly by temporary terrestrial links between the landmass of Western Asia and the eastern islands of the European archipelago, then between the different European islands up to the Ibero- Armorican Island. A similar scenario probably applies to the presence on this island during the late Maastrichtian of another lambeosaurine with Asian affinity, the genus Pararhabdodon which is close to the Chinese Tsintaosaurus (which lived 15 million years earlier). Both Canardia and Pararhabdodon belong to lambeosaurines groups that are rather archaic for their time (Aralosaurini and Tsintaosaurini respectively) and the Ibero-Armorican Island was perhaps an ultimate refuge for these ancient groups of lambeosaurines hadrosaurs. =Palaeoenvironment= The Marnes d’Auzas Formation is 100 m thick. It corresponds to sediments whose depositional environment evolved from the paralic domain (coastal lagoons, tidal marsh, tidal muddy channel) at the base of the formation, towards a more continental domain (alluvial plain, fluvial channels) in its upper part. From a paleogeographic point of view, the sites of the Marnes d’Auzas Formation were located on the west coast of the Ibero- Armorican Island (which included much of France and Spain), facing the Atlantic Gulf. Few other vertebrates fossils have been found with the Canardia remains. The type locality of Tricouté 3, in the basal part of the Marnes d’Auzas Formation, has yielded only a crocodilian tooth, whereas the marine Marly limestone of Gensac Formation (the lateral equivalent of the top of the Marnes d’Auzas) has not yet yielded other terrestrial vertebrates remains. However, a more diverse fauna is known from the Cassagnau localities, in the middle part of the Marnes d’Auzas Formation. The Cassagnau's fauna is also located near Marignac-Laspeyres and includes several fish (Lepisosteidae, Phyllodontidae, Sparidae), Amphibians (Albanerpetontidae), several turtles including a complete carapace of Iberoccitanemys convenarum, various crocodylians including teeth of a Musturzabalsuchus-like form and a complete skull attributed to Thoracosaurus neocesariensis, two squamates (an indeterminate lizard and a varanoid form which is probably a freshwater mosasauroid), a probable enantiornithe bird, an indeterminate dromaeosaurid (known only by teeth), an indeterminate theropod of larger size (only known by a tooth characterized by its anterior carina running on the lingual side of the teeth), an indeterminate titanosaurian sauropod represented by teeth and a metacarpal (the shape of the teeth suggests that they belong to an Atsinganosaurus-like form), and an indeterminate lambeosaurine hadrosaur. The latter is exclusively represented by juvenile individuals and includes an articulated postcranial skeleton, teeth, and two left dentaries, one of them being associated with a predentary. No maxilla is preserved in these specimens, so it is not possible to know if this hadrosaur belongs to Canardia or to another lambeosaurine. The Marnes d’Auzas Formation is also present in the department of Ariège, notably near the village of Mérigon. There, a coarse sandstone bed at the top of the formation, has yielded a tooth and a dentary fragment of an indeterminate hadrosaur, as well as a cervical vertebra of a giant Azhdarchid pterosaur of 9 meters wingspan.

Apart from numerous foreign productions, the main focus traditionally is on German movies. During six festival days, about 130 films (90 feature and documentary films as well as 40 short films) are shown in 8 auditoriums of 2 cinema centers, adding up to a total of 200 individual film presentations. With the exception of the retrospective, all movies are German or world premieres.  History  Initiators of the festival were Heinz Badewitz and Uwe Brandner, who were also members of the Hof “New Jazz Group”, together with the artist Werner Weinelt, who later on relocated his art gallery to the pub “Galeriehaus” in Hof. Badewitz, festival director until his death in 2016, and Brandner, had moved to Munich in 1963 where they made short films together. However, they had problems to find a cinema for their film presentations in Munich. Without further ado, Badewitz, who was born in Hof and knew the local cinema operators quite well, and Brandner decided to stage their films in the small town in Upper Franconia. Thus, a Hof short film festival came into existence in 1967 with an overall program duration of not more than 2,5 hours. In 1968, Badewitz was invited to take part in the German competition of the Oberhausen short film festival with his 2nd short film. The scandal surrounding Hellmuth Costard’s contribution film “Besonders Wertvoll” (“Especially Worthwhile”) was to lead the film makers to Hof, since they had withdrawn their works from the Oberhausen festival in protest – the starting signal for the 2nd Hof International Film Festival in 1968. Initially, the “Hofer Filmtage” were a mere audience-focused festival without any kind of competitions or awards. The festival rapidly becomes the annual meeting point for the “Jungfilmer”, the makers of the New German Movie. Many directors show their debut films in Hof and maintain friendly connections with the festival for years. During the 25th anniversary festival in 1991, Wim Wenders shapes the term of “Hof – Home of Films”. The motto of the festival originates from Heinz Badewitz himself: “We don’t need stars – we create them.” In 1984, the horror movie “Nightmare on Elm Street” with the film figure Freddy Krueger has its world premiere at the International Hof Film Festival. Apart from that, director George A. Romero presents the world premiere of his horror movie “Zombie – Dawn of the Dead” at the filmfestival in Northern Bavaria.50 Jahre Hofer Filmtage: Die Guten von gestern von Wolfgang Höbel auf der Homepage des Nachrichtenmagazins Der Spiegel, www.spiegel.de, Text zu Foto 2 in der Bilder-Galerie, 25. Oktober 2016, abgerufen am 15. Mai 2020 During the preparations for the 50th anniversary festival in 2016, Heinz Badewitz passed away completely unexpectedly. The festival, however, took place as usual in the last week of October. It was organized by the festival team and many highly motivated volunteers. Curators of the film program were Linda Söffker, Alfred Holighaus and Thorsten Schaumann. Since the 51st International Hof Film Festival in 2017, Thorsten Schaumann has been the artistic director of the event. He initiated the format of HoF PLUS that accompanies the festival with panel discussions about current issues of the film business. He also fathered the HoF RENDEZVOUS, a format that features intrayear presentations of movies from the previous festival. In 2018, a cooperation with the International Film Festival Karlovy Vary took place for the first time. A traditional side event of the festival is the soccer game FC Filmwelt Hof vs. FC Hofer Filmtage that takes place on each year’s festival Saturday. Every year a team of actors, directors and producers play against a team of eleven players from the festival organisation and festival supporters.  Festival 2020  Due to the present pandemic situation, there will also be an online access to the 2020 festival. HoF-On-Demand makes festival movies accessible also for those who don’t travel to Hof in person. Moreover, 4 additional cinema auditorium venues have been established with respect to reduced admission capacities.  Films  The festival covers the almost full spectrum of non-mainstream movies, the main focus being on films of German origin. Especially debut works from German film academies account for a large part of the program. However, the festival provides a showcase for non-domestic productions, too. Movies from all over Europe, the US, Australia and New Zealand, only to mention a few, are being shown. Out of 2,000-2,500 submissions, a selection of about 90 feature and documentary films as well as about 40 short films sum up to a total of about 130 approved program movies.  Festival Guests  Since the first festival in 1967, many directors and actors have been present at the festival in person, gladly answering questions from the audience or taking part in the many discussion panels around the festival. Many of the film makers and actors have sustainably succeeded in the domestic and international film industry after their first appearance in Hof. Here are some of the most reknown personalities: {  ! width=\\"40%\\" valign=\\"top\\"  * Maren Ade * Detlev Buck * Doris Dörrie * Atom Egoyan * Rainer Werner Fassbinder * Dominik Graf * Veit Helmer * Oliver Herbrich  ! width=\\"40%\\" valign=\\"top\\"  * Werner Herzog * Peter Jackson * Jim Jarmusch * Aki Kaurismäki * Amos Kollek * Clara Law * Mike Leigh  ! width=\\"40%\\" valign=\\"top\\"  * Dani Levy * Caroline Link * Rosa von Praunheim * Ulrich Seidl * Tom Tykwer * Wim Wenders * Sönke Wortmann }  Retrospective  Every year, a retrospective is dedicated to exceptional movie directors.

The award is endowed with 10,000 € and donated by Bavaria Film, the Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation) and the DZ Bank. Among all those German movies that have their international premiere at the festival, the “Best Film” will be awarded. An independent jury decide upon the award-winning film. * Filmpreis der Stadt Hof - Film Award of the City Hof : This prize has been awarded since 1986. It is actually a piece of art sculpture consisting of previous years’ festival program catalogue pages. As a matter of fact, the winner is rewarded with artistically redesigned movie contents. It was created by Christina Mosif and Konrad Grässler in the frameworks of a project launched by the vocational school for product design in Selb, Bavaria. The award is dedicated to persons deeply connected with the town of Hof and the film festival itself. The winners are usually not represented with a film at the current festival. * Hofer Goldpreis - Hof Gold Award : The prize is donated by the Friedrich-Baur- Stiftung and awarded by the Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste in memoriam Heinz Badewitz. It replaces the Heinz Badewitz Award of 2016 and 2017. It is awarded for the best directing performance in a debut feature film. Every year, the academy assigns another tutor from their film and media art department who will decide upon the award winner. The prize itself is a certified 1 kg gold bar at a current value of about 35,000 €. Moreover, the award winner benefits from artistic advice with creating a new movie for the duration of one year. Every director whose feature film has its premiere at the festival automatically participates in the competition. In 2018, director Edgar Reitz was the awarding tutor. In 2019, director Bernhard Sinkel had the honor to decide upon and announce the award winner. * VGF Young Producers Award : Since 1994, the \\"Verwertungsgesellschaft für Nutzungsrechte an Filmwerken mbH (VGF) \\" has awarded the prize to the best movie of a young producer. An independent board of jurors evaluate all submitted German feature films with regard to overall quality as well as audience attractiveness. With 65,000 €, the prize is the highest endowed young producers award in Germany. The prize money is not for a specific purpose. It is meant to strengthen the equity capital ratio of young production companies. * Hans Vogt Movie Award : With this award, the small town of Rehau commemorates the pioneering achievement of Hans Vogt, who was born and grew up in the Rehau suburb of town Wurlitz. As an engineer, Hans Vogt was decisively involved in the invention of the sound film. Since 2013, the prize has been awarded to filmmakers who are innovatively and thoroughly concerned about their movie’s overall sound performance. It is endowed with 5,000 €. * Granite Award - (Hofer Dokumentarfilmpreis) : The local Hermann und Bertl Müller Stiftung has rewarded the best German long documentary film with a prize money of 7,500 € since 2015. * Bild-Kunst Advancement Award : The award was suggested in 1997 by the “Course of Studies Film And Television / Department Production Design” of the Munich Film And Television Academy. It rewards the best production design and the best costume design of a feature film and is endowed with 2,500 €.  Awards no longer awarded  * German Film Promotion Prize : The Förderpreis Deutscher Film, sponsored by HypoVereinsbank, Bavaria Film and Bayerisches Fernsehen, was awarded as a prize for young talents from 2005 to 2011. The prize was awarded for an outstanding artistic achievement in a German film that was screened in the programme of the Hof International Film Festival. The prize was replaced by the Förderpreis Neues Deutsches Kino in 2012. * Eastman Award for Young Talent : The \\"Eastman Award for Young Talent\\", donated by Kodak GmbH, was awarded from 1984 to 2012 and honoured one young director and his or her film. The prize was endowed with raw film material and was intended to help with the director's next production.

It is known from a partial holotype skull from the middle Stubensandstein (a deposit that dates back to the Norian stage and is part of the Löwenstein Formation) in Baden-Württemberg. The type species is Apatosuchus orbitoangulatus. A. orbitoangulatus was first described by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1932, who considered it a species of the theropod dinosaur Halticosaurus. Some later studies proposed that it was an early crocodylomorph or \\"sphenosuchian\\" like Saltoposuchus, another pseudosuchian from the middle Stubensandstein of Baden-Württemberg. The name Apatosuchus was erected for H. orbitoangulatus by Hans-Dieter Sues and Rainer R. Schoch in 2013 when it was realized that the known material represented a pseudosuchian archosaur rather than a dinosaur, as a result of further preparation of the specimen. Apatosuchus is now thought to be a basal member of the clade Loricata. Apatosuchus is much smaller in size than other basal loricatans such as Teratosaurus and Batrachotomus. Phylogeny A phylogenetic analysis performed by Sues & Schoch (2013) found Apatosuchus to be the sister taxon of the clade formed by Batrachotomus and more derived loricatans. This position was supported by two unambiguous synapomorphies: the presence of a ridge on the dorsal surface of squamosal along the edge of supratemporal fossa, and concaved rear portion of the nasals at the midline. The data matrix of Sues & Schoch (2013), a list of characteristics that was used in the analysis, was based on that of Nesbitt (2011), one of the most extensive on archosaurs.

It can be regarded as an early type of retirement home, which lasted up to the 19th century. As an institution, they were an improvement over almshouses for the elderly poor known as hofjes. Because older men were generally less able to care for themselves than women, the city councils of the Netherlands built special purpose houses. After the introduction of Oude Mannenhuizen, the hofjes were designed almost exclusively for women, because women could organize themselves more efficiently. For women who became too feeble to take part in hofje life, special \\"old houses\\" for woman were opened, that were often combined with old men's houses. Like the hofjes, living in an old man's house was usually free of charge and was considered a favor. Similar to hofjes, the regents of old men's houses had a regent's room for meetings. The regents made and enforced the house rules, such as making church attendance mandatory and ladies visit or drunkenness prohibited. Breaking the rules was usually followed by house arrest. The old men lived in a room where they only had a bedstead, and occasionally they were assigned two to a room. A few old men's houses have been preserved, but they have been given a different purpose. Older men with means could buy a room in a Proveniershuis, which was cheaper than a rental or hotel, but afforded more luxury than an Oude Mannenhuis.

Biography Being one of the sons of Jesse of Kartli by his wife Princess Elene-Begum (a daughter of King Erekle I of Kakheti), Anton was born a royal prince (batonishvili). He was raised together with his cousin prince Erekle, the future king Erekle II, in Telavi, Kakheti. There, he studied in order to become priest, as well as learning the Greek, \\"Tatar\\", and Persian languages. At age 15, Anton became engaged to the daughter of the influential politician Givi Amilakhvari, however, his bride was taken away by Nader Shah when the latter took Tiflis (Tbilisi) in 1735. According to Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze, therefore, the reconquest of Georgia over the Ottomans by Nader Shah in 1735 through the Ottoman-Persian War of 1730-1735 had a profound effect on Anton, for he left the court and became a monk at the Gelati Monastery in 1738. Five years later, he moved to the Gareja Monastery in Kakheti, and was elected catholicos-patriarch of the Orthodox Church in 1744. In a row of important political events that occurred in 1744, this event coincided with the Iranian king Nader Shah granting the kingship of Kartli and Kakheti to Anton's uncle Teimuraz II and his cousin Erekle II, respectively. Anton established close relations with the Catholic missions active in Georgia and worked to improve contacts with Western Europe; regarding the former, he received criticism from the conservative clergy, who accused him of corrupting the Georgian Orthodox faith and trying to introduce Catholicism in Georgia. When Teimuraz II nullified the Catholic presence by moving them from Georgia, Anton's opponents took their chance. The ecclesiastical council led by Anton's opponent Zacharias A. Gabashvili, had Anton dismissed from his position on 17 December 1755, and he was succeeded by Catholicos-Patriarch Ioseb Jandieri. After his dismissal, which basically meant banishment, as well as 18 months of imprisonment, he moved to Russia, where he reportedly succeeded in getting himself cleansed from these charges at the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on 16 March 1757, and was appointed Archbishop of Vladimir on 23 November 1757 by the decree of Catherine II. Upon Erekle II's invitation, in 1762, Anton returned to the newly established Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti. In the subsequent church council, now back in his homeland, Anton I defeated the conservatives and was reelected to the position catholicos-patriarch in 1764, thus starting his 2nd term. He was involved in the political life of his cousin, and renewed his efforts to bring the Georgian principalities closer to Europe. In the years of 1772-1782 (he was sent in 1772 by Erekle II himself, Anton took part in the negotiations which led up to the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783. Anton I died on 12 March 1788 and was buried in the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta, in front of the king's gate. =Socio-cultural efforts= Anton was a generous supporter of the Georgian arts and literature, and supervised the establishment of a number of schools, which included the seminaries of Tbilisi and Telavi in 1755 and 1782 respectively. He personally directed the drafting of the curricula in these schools, wrote the textbook in 1753, and translated European treatises on physics, which he taught in seminaries. As further stated by Prof. Mikaberidze, he was instrumental in reorganizing the new ecclesiastial calendar, wrote original hymns and canons, and translated numerous Slavic Orthodox works into Georgian. In 1769, Anton completed one of his greatest works named Martirika and began his long poetical study of the cultural history of Georgia, titled with the name Tsakobilstikvaoba. Responsible for directing the educational system in Kartli- Kakheti for a quarter of a century, as stated by Prof. Mikaberidze, under his guidance a new generation of Georgian artists, scientists, and writers were produced, amongst whom Ambrosi Nekreseli, Gaioz Rektori, Philip Qaitmazashvili, amongst others. Thanks to his efforts, he left a deep imprint on the 18th-century sciences in Georgia, specifically on philosophy and literature.

Once two users have \\"matched\\", they can exchange messages. Tinder launched in 2012 within startup incubator Hatch Labs as a joint venture between IAC and mobile app development firm Xtreme Labs. By 2014, Tinder was registering about one billion \\"swipes\\" per day. Tinder originally required access to a Facebook account to use the app, but it began allowing users to register with just a telephone number in August 2019. It is accessible through a mobile app or a web browser for computers. Sign up requires a mobile device. Tinder operates on a freemium business model. History =Hatch Labs, Matchbox and Cardify= In January 2012, Sean Rad was hired by startup incubator Hatch Labs CEO, Dinesh Moorjani, as GM of Cardify, a credit card loyalty app. Introduced to engineer (later technical co-founder) Joe Munoz for a hackathon, they built the prototype for MatchBox in February 2012. Rad has said the impetus for the dating app's creation was his observation that \\"no matter who you are, you feel more comfortable approaching somebody if you know they want you to approach them.\\" He believed a \\"double opt-in\\" system could be created to potentially alleviate the stress of meeting new people. Rad has also said Tinder filled a gap in the availability of social platforms for meeting strangers, rather than connecting with people a user already knows. In March 2012, Jonathan Badeen joined as a front-end operator (later Chief Strategy Officer) and Chris Gulczynski joined as a designer (who designed the flame logo before the name change to Tinder), later becoming CCO. The team worked out of the personal office of Justin Mateen, who had known Rad since age 14, also came from a Jewish-Iranian family from the Los Angeles area, had attended the University of Southern California, and became an entrepreneur at the same time as Rad, but was not yet a part of MatchBox or Cardify. Cardify's release was delayed by Apple's App Store approval process, so the team focused on MatchBox, while still interviewing marketing contractors to sell Cardify to merchant. In May 2012, Justin Mateen's sister, Alexa, and her friend, Whitney Wolfe Herd],were interviewed and hired as field sales reps for Cardify . In August 2012, Matchbox was renamed to Tinder to match the logo, and soft launched in the App Store. Rad brought Justin Mateen onto Tinder as a contractor to lead the launch marketing. He lobbied for his sister and Wolfe to be hired to Tinder, to help him as field marketors. Tinder was then launched at numerous college campuses and quickly expanded to additional campuses, winning TechCrunch's Crunchie Award for \\"Best New Startup of 2013,\\" with Cardify and Hatch Labs being abandoned and ceasing operations by that point. Mateen later became CMO, his sister became Social Media Director, and he started dating Wolfe in late 2012, who was at some point, promoted to VP Marketing. She started using the co- founder title against company approval, before quitting at a company party in April 2014 and filing a sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit. Wolfe was consequently later discovered by the Badoo dating app founder, who contacted her about his dating app idea, provided funding (for 80% ownership), and shared his Badoo engineering team for her to market and lead what became known as Bumble in 2014 for her 20% ownership. Accordingly, sources restrict the list of founders to Rad, Mateen, and Badeen, * \\"When Whitney did interviews, she repeatedly asked Sean to let her go by “co-founder,” claiming that the press would take her more seriously if she had that title, according to people in the office.\\" *\\"...after all, she was dating his best friend and they all worked together) and he did, in fact, give in a number of times.\\" * “Sean knew she wasn’t a founder… we all knew she wasn’t a founder,” one source said on the phone. “But he wanted to help her career, and he knew that having female representation in the press could only be a good thing for the company.” * One employee even recounted an instance in which Whitney said that she knew she wasn’t supposed to be using “co-founder” in her email signature, but would continue to do so until Sean found out.\\" * \\"One employee, who was present in a meeting between Sean and Whitney, says that after the Harper’s Bazaar article and a couple of others like it, Sean explained that Whitney should not have been using the term co-founder in the press because it was causing confusion with the media and internally at Tinder. * \\"That same witness says that Whitney sent a series of messages to Sean shortly following the article’s publication in which she expresses that she knew she wasn’t supposed to be going by co-founder for that article.\\" * \\"There’s also evidence pointing to the fact that she may have used the term co-founder behind the backs of other founders and against their wishes, which adds even more fog to the situation.\\" * \\"Yet, it seems that Whitney was well aware that her use of the term co-founder was for the purposes of doing press for the company and not because she actually co-founded the company.\\" though this has been disputed. =2013–2015= By May 2013, Tinder was one of the top 25 social networking apps online, based on frequency of use and number of users. Initially, instead of utilizing Tinder's current swiping motion for making matches, users had to click either a green heart or a red X to select or move on from a displayed photo. Tinder became the first new online dating service to claim a spot as one of the web's top five utilized services in about 10 years. Sean Rad has served as Tinder's CEO on two occasions. He was the company's initial CEO until March 2015, when he was replaced by former eBay and Microsoft executive Chris Payne. Payne left the company, and Rad simultaneously returned as CEO, in August 2015. Rad stepped down as CEO again in December 2016, becoming Tinder's chairman and ceding the CEO position to former Tinder chairman Greg Blatt. By October 2014, Tinder users completed over one billion swipes per day, producing about twelve million matches per day. By this time, Tinder's average user generally spent about 90 minutes a day on the app. Tinder became the first \\"swipe app,\\" a now-common term for various apps that utilize left or right swiping gestures to control what content the user sees when browsing, after switching from its original icon- based functionality following inspiration co-founder Jonathan Badeen had while wiping off a foggy mirror in his bathroom. The swipe functionality is now used by multiple other companies and software. In 2015, Tinder introduced the ability to go back to rejected profiles via a \\"rewinding\\" function, allowing users to correct mistaken actions. This was previously not possible, as rejected profiles would simply not appear again. Companion apps have been developed to provide different actions or mechanisms to accomplish Tinder's swipe function. Users can, for example, use companion apps to have their heart rate determine which direction to swipe, instead of swiping with their fingers. In October 2015, Tinder released the Super Like feature worldwide. This allows non-paying users to Super Like one profile every 24 hours for free. Tinder Plus users can use up to five Super Likes a day. Instead of swiping right, a user must swipe up or tap a blue star icon to Super Like a displayed profile. Tinder notifies users if they have been Super Liked by adding a blue border to the profiles of anyone who Super Liked them. Tinder has stated that Super Likes make it three times more likely for users to match than standard right swipes. As of November 11, 2015, Tinder's \\"Moments\\" feature had been retired. =2016= In September 2016, Tinder invested in Vina, a social network for women to meet and nurture new friendships. Tinder began testing its Boost functionality in September 2016 in Australia. The feature went live for all users worldwide in October 2016. Boost allows users to make their profile the most visible profile in their area for thirty minutes, showing such profiles first to other nearby users. Tinder claims its users can receive up to ten times as many profile views as usual while Boost is active. Tinder Plus users can use one free Boost a month. Non-subscribers and Tinder Plus subscribers who want more Boosts can purchase additional Boost actions. This feature is similar to a premium feature utilized on OkCupid, another Match Group property. In October 2016, Tinder announced the opening of its first office in Silicon Valley, in the hope of more effectively recruiting technical employees. In November 2016, Tinder introduced more options for gender selection. In the app's settings, users now have the option to type a word that best fits their gender identity. Users can choose whether this is displayed on their profile or not. This feature was released for the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. =2017= In March 2017, Tinder launched Tinder Online, a web-optimized version of the dating app so people can access Tinder at their desktops. Initially, It was only available in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the Philippines and Sweden and didn't include special features such as Super Likes or Tinder Boost. Tinder Online launched globally in September 2017. In June 2017, Tinder launched Tinder Gold, a members-only service, offering their most exclusive features: Passport, Rewind, Unlimited Likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. This is an optional service offered to Tinder Plus users that costs an additional fee as a paid subscription. =2018= On August 6, 2018, Tinder had over 3.7 million paid subscribers, up to 81 percent over the same quarter in 2017. On August 21, 2018, Tinder launched Tinder University, a feature that allows college students to connect with other students on their campus and at nearby schools. On December 2018, Tinder launched a new editorial website: Swipe Life. =2019= On May 10, 2019, it was reported that Tinder was planning for a lighter version app called Tinder Lite aimed at growing markets where data usage, bandwidth and storage space are a concern. On August 6, 2019, Tinder had 5.2 million paying subscribers at the end of 2019's second quarter, up 1.5 million from the year-ago quarter and up 503,000 from the first quarter of 2019. Tinder became the highest grossing non-gaming app, beating Netflix.Tinder's subscriber growth led Match Group's shares to the best single-day gain in their history on August 7, adding more than $5 billion to the company's market capitalization. =2020= In January 2020, the Tinder administration enabled a panic button and anti-catfishing tech to improve the safety of US users. In the future, these features should become globally available. If something goes wrong on a date, a user can hit a panic button, transmit accurate location data, and call emergency services. Also, before going to a meeting, users are required to take selfies to prove their photos in Tinder profiles match their real identities. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, Tinder temporarily made its Passport feature available for free to all of its users worldwide. Previously this feature had been only accessible to users who had purchased a subscription. On September 12, Tinder relaunched Swipe Night, an interactive series where users make decisions following a storyline. Swipe Night had previously been launched in October 2019. It was slated to be launched internationally in March 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed until September. Swipe Nights international launch included multiple countries and languages. The three major decisions made in each episode of the interactive series displays on the user's profile and can be used for matching potential. Operation Tinder's primary companion site has been Facebook, as Tinder users were originally required to connect their Facebook profiles to their Tinder accounts for verification and profile details. Using Facebook, Tinder is able to build a user profile with photos that have already been uploaded. Basic information is gathered and the users' social graph is analyzed. Candidates who are most likely to be compatible based on geographical location, number of mutual friends, and common interests are streamed into a list of matches. Based on the results of potential candidates, the app allows the user to anonymously like another user by swiping right or pass by swiping left on them. If two users like each other it then results in a \\"match\\" and they are able to chat within the app. Chatting on Tinder is only available between two users that have swiped right on one another's photos. The selections a user makes are not known to other users, unless two individuals swipe right on each other's profiles. However, once the user has matches on the app, they are able to send personal photos, called \\"Tinder Moments\\", to all matches at once, allowing each match to like or not like the photos. The site also has verified profiles for public figures, so that celebrities and other public figures can verify they are who they are when using the app. The app is currently used in about 196 countries. =Features= *Swipe is central to Tinder's design. From the compatible matches the app's algorithm provides, users swipe right to \\"like\\" potential matches and swipe left to continue on their search. *Messaging is also a heavily utilized feature. Once a user matches with another user, they're able to exchange text messages on the app. *Instagram integration enables users to access other users' Instagram profiles. *Common Connections allows users to see whether they share a mutual Facebook friend with a match (a first-degree connection on Tinder) or when a user and their match have two separate friends who happen to be friends with each other (considered second-degree on Tinder). *Tinder Gold, introduced worldwide in August 2017, is a premium subscription feature that allows the user to see those who have already liked them before swiping. *Panic button is introduced in the US from January 2020. The feature will include emergency assistance, location tracking, and photo verification. = Paid subscriptions = In March 2015, Tinder released its paid service, Tinder Plus, a feature allowing unlimited matches, whereas the free Tinder app limits the number of right swipes in a 12-hour period. It has met with controversy over limiting the number of \\"likes\\" a free user can give in a certain amount of time, as well as charging prices for different age groups. The price of a Tinder Plus subscription was £14.99/US$19.99 per month for users over 28, while the service for a user 28 and under was £3.99/US$9.99 per month. =Users= Tinder is used widely throughout the world and is available in over 40 languages. As of late 2014, an estimated 50 million people used the app every month with an average of 12 million matches per day. However, to get to those 12 million matches, users collectively made around 1 billion swipes per day. The minimum age to sign up and use Tinder was 18. As of June 2016, Tinder is no longer usable by anyone under 18. If minors were found being under 18, they were banned from using Tinder until they are 18. As of April 2015, Tinder users swiped through 1.6 billion Tinder profiles and made more than 26 million matches per day. More than 8 billion matches had been made since Tinder launched in 2012. Company overview =Financials= In March 2014, media and internet conglomerate IAC increased its majority stake in Tinder, a move that caused speculation that the valuation of Tinder was at several billion dollars. In July 2015, Bank of America Merrill Lynch valued Tinder at $1.35 billion based upon an estimate of $27 per user on an estimated user base of 50 million with an additional bullish estimate of $3 billion by taking the average of the IPOs of similar companies. Analysts also estimated that Tinder had about half a million paid users within its userbase that consisted mostly of free users. The monetization of the site has come through leaving the basic app free, and then adding different in-app purchase options for additional functions. In January 2015 Tinder acquired Chill, the developers of Tappy, a mobile messenger that uses \\"images and ephemerality\\". =Advertising= An ad campaign launched by \\"The Barn\\" internship program of Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) used Tinder profiles to promote their NYC Puppy Rescue Project. Using Facebook pet profiles, BBH was able to add them to the Tinder network. The campaign received media coverage from Slate, Inc., The Huffington Post, and others. In April 2015, Tinder revealed their first sponsored ad promoting Budweiser's next #Whatever, USA campaign. User behavior As of June 2015, 62% of Tinder users were male and 38% were female. According to University of Texas at Austin psychologist David Buss, \\"Apps like Tinder and OkCupid give people the impression that there are thousands or millions of potential mates out there. One dimension of this is the impact it has on men's psychology. When there is ... a perceived surplus of women, the whole mating system tends to shift towards short-term dating,\\" and there is a feeling of disconnect when choosing future partners. In addition, the cognitive process identified by psychologist Barry Schwartz as the \\"paradox of choice\\" (also referred to as \\"choice overload\\" or \\"fear of a better option\\") was cited in an article published in The Atlantic that suggested that the appearance of an abundance of potential partners causes online daters to be less likely to choose a partner and be less satisfied with their choices of partners. Tinder CEO Sean Rad has said that Tinder removes the \\"friction\\" associated with walking up to someone and introducing oneself. However, data released by Tinder itself has shown that of the 1.6 billion swipes it records per day, only 26 million result in matches (a match rate of approximately only 1.63%), despite users logging into the app on average 11 times per day, with male user sessions averaging 7.2 minutes and female user sessions averaging 8.5 minutes (or 79.2 minutes and 93.5 minutes per day respectively). Also, a Tinder user interviewed anonymously in an article published in the December 2018 issue of The Atlantic estimated that only one in 10 of their matches actually resulted in an exchange of messages with the other user they were matched with, with another anonymous Tinder user saying, \\"Getting right-swiped is a good ego boost even if I have no intention of meeting someone,\\" leading The Atlantic article author to conclude \\"Unless you are exceptionally good- looking, the thing online dating may be best at is sucking up large amounts of time.\\" In August 2015, journalist Nancy Jo Sales wrote in Vanity Fair that Tinder operates within a culture of users seeking sex without relationships. In 2017, the Department of Communications Studies at Texas Tech University conducted a study to see how infidelity was connected to the Tinder app. The experiment was conducted on 550 students from an unnamed university in the Southwestern United States. The students first provided their demographic information and then answered questions regarding Tinder's link to infidelity. The results showed that more than half reported having seen somebody on Tinder who they knew was in an exclusive relationship (63.9%). 71.3% of participants reported that they knew male friends who used Tinder while in a relationship, and 56.1% reported that they had female friends who used Tinder while in a relationship. In 1989, social psychologist Douglas T. Kenrick demonstrated experimentally that by following exposure to photographs or stories about desirable potential mates, people decrease their ratings of commitment to their current partners. David Buss has estimated that approximately 30 percent of the men on Tinder are married. Before 2012, most online dating services matched people according to their autobiographical information, such as interests, hobbies, future plans, among other things. But the advent of Tinder that year meant that first impressions could play a crucial role. For social scientists studying human courtship behavior, Tinder offers a much simpler environment than its predecessors. In 2016, Gareth Tyson of the Queen Mary University of London and his colleagues published a paper analyzing the behavior of Tinder users in New York City and London. In order to minimize the number of variables, they created profiles of white heterosexual people only. For each sex, there were three accounts using stock photographs, two with actual photographs of volunteers, one with no photos whatsoever, and one that was apparently deactivated. The researchers pointedly only used pictures of people of average physical attractiveness. Tyson and his team wrote an algorithm that collected the biographical information of all the matches, liked them all, then counted the number of returning likes. They found that men and women employed drastically different mating strategies. Men liked a large proportion of the profiles they viewed, but received returning likes only 0.6% of the time; women were much more selective but received matches 10% of the time. Men received matches at a much slower rate than women. Once they received a match, women were far more likely than men to send a message, 21% compared to 7%, but they took more time before doing so. Tyson and his team found that for the first two-thirds of messages from each sex, women sent them within 18 minutes of receiving a match compared to five minutes for men. Men's first messages had an average of a dozen characters, and were typical simple greetings; by contrast, initial messages by women averaged 122 characters. Tyson and his collaborators found that the male profiles that had three profile pictures received 238 matches while the male profiles with only one profile picture received only 44 matches (or approximately a 5 to 1 ratio). Additionally, male profiles that had a biography received 69 matches while those without it received only 16 matches (or approximately a 4 to 1 ratio). By sending out questionnaires to frequent Tinder users, the researchers discovered that the reason why men tended to like a large proportion of the women they saw was to increase their chances of getting a match. This led to a feedback loop in which men liked more and more of the profiles they saw while women could afford to be even more selective in liking profiles because of a greater probability of a match. The mathematical limit of the feedback loop occurs when men like all profiles they see while women find a match whenever they like a profile. It was not known whether some evolutionarily stable strategy has emerged, nor has Tinder revealed such information. Tyson and his team found that even though the men-to-women ratio of their data set was approximately one, the male profiles received 8,248 matches in total while the female profiles received only 532 matches in total because the vast majority of the matches for both the male and female profiles came from male profiles (with 86 percent of the matches for the male profiles alone coming from other male profiles), leading the researchers to conclude that homosexual men were \\"far more active in liking than heterosexual women.\\" On the other hand, the deactivated male account received all of its matches from women. The researchers were not sure why this happened. Safety issues There are also cybersecurity, data privacy, and public health concerns about Tinder. Public health officials in Rhode Island and Utah have claimed that Tinder and similar apps are responsible for an uptick of some STDs. In February 2014, security researchers in New York found a flaw which made it possible to find users' precise locations for between 40 and 165 days. Tinder's spokesperson, Rosette Pambakian, said the issue was resolved within 48 hours. Tinder CEO Sean Rad said in a statement that shortly after being contacted, Tinder implemented specific measures to enhance location security and further obscure location data. In August 2016, two engineers found another flaw that showed the exact location of all users' matches. The location was updated every time a user logged into the app and it worked even for blocked matches. The issue was detected in March 2016, but it was not fixed until August 2016. In July 2017, a study published in Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing found that Tinder users are excessively willing to disclose their personally identifiable information. In September 2017, The Guardian published an article by a journalist who requested all data that the Tinder app had recorded about her from the company and found that Tinder stores all user messages, user locations and times, the characteristics of other users who interest a particular user, the characteristics of particular users of interest to other users, and the length of time users spend looking at particular pictures, which for the journalist amounted to 800 pages of detail. There have been anti-Tinder online marketing campaigns and websites developed. On June 30, 2014, Tinder's co-founder and former vice president of marketing, Whitney Wolfe, filed a sexual harassment and sex discrimination suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against IAC-owned Match Group, the parent company of Tinder. The lawsuit alleged that her fellow executives and co-founders Rad and Mateen had engaged in discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation against her, while Tinder's corporate supervisor, IAC's Sam Yagan, did nothing. IAC suspended CMO Mateen from his position pending an ongoing investigation, and stated that it \\"acknowledges that Mateen sent private messages containing 'inappropriate content,' but it believes Mateen, Rad and the company are innocent of the allegations\\". In December 2018, The Verge reported that Tinder had dismissed Rosette Pambakian, the company's vice president of marketing and communication who had accused Tinder's former CEO Greg Blatt of sexual assault, along with several other employees who were part of the group of Tinder employees who had previously sued the Match Group for $2 billion. Reception =Reviews= The New York Times wrote that the wide use of Tinder could be attributed not to what Tinder was doing right but to flaws in the models of earlier dating software, which relied on mathematical algorithms to select potential partners. Relationship experts interviewed by the newspaper stated that users used the photographs that come in succession on the app to derive cues as to social status, confidence levels, and personal interests. Marie Claire wrote that the app was \\"easy to use on the run\\" and \\"addictive\\" but that \\"...it's hard to focus. The game-style of Tinder means it's really easy to keep playing and forget about that hottie you were messaging yesterday.\\" In September 2020, Pakistan announced that it would ban five dating apps, including Tinder; this is because Pakistan's government believes that that apps are providing immoral/indecent content to users which do not comply with their local laws. =The Tinder effect= Tomas Chamorro- Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at University College London and vice-president of research and innovation at Hogan Assessment Systems, wrote in The Guardian about the Tinder effect, which is the way relationships are modified by dating apps and why Tinder is so successful. In this article he depicts five psychological lessons from the Tinder effect which are the following. *Hook-up apps are more arousing than actual hook-ups: Tinder gamifies and sexualizes the dating process. It is not just a way to get a date with someone, but it is an end in itself. *Digital eligibility exceeds physical eligibility: Most of the data imported to Tinder by the users for their profile comes from their Facebook profile, which are sophisticated and calculated, making them a lot more attractive. *Evolutionary and social needs: Tinder is driven by today's social needs, granting people a way to get in touch, to compete with each other, and to know what others think of them. Not much information has been revealed officially about the algorithm matching people, yet it was disclosed that it uses a rating system similar to the Elo rating system. This system, widely used in sports shows the competitive dimension of Tinder, even though grades are only used by the algorithm and not disclosed to the users. *Tinder does emulate the real dating world: Tinder is about making quick choices based on the appearance, which is what people actually tend to do when meeting a potential date for the first time. *Romanticism is dead, except in retail: Tinder adapts to the lack of time of its users and their realism about soulmates by matching them efficiently and rationally, ensuring them a new relationship quickly but with no guarantee that it will be a long-term success. Natasha Aponte incident In August 2018, New York-based model Natasha Aponte made headlines after she was reported to have amassed dozens of men she matched with on Tinder in Union Square, Manhattan, where she had set up a \\"Live Tinder\\" dating competition in which they will have to vie for a date with her. According to some of the men, they received a sudden message from Aponte – after she had stopped corresponding with them for quite some time – reminding them that they meet her at said location where she said \\"her friend was DJing around 6\\", and where she wanted to go for a drink for their first date afterwards. Upon arrival, the men were then perplexed (and furious) to find out that they had been conned into competing for Aponte, who explained that \\"she was over dating apps and wanted instead for her suitors to participate in a competition.\\" The stunt – which was labelled by New York magazine as the \\"Summer of Scam\\" and Gizmodo as \\"a cross between The Bachelorette and Catfish with a little bit of Punk'd thrown in for comedic appeal\\" – turned out to be pulled by an agency that was responsible for shooting a 2014 viral YouTube video in which a woman – attached with hidden cameras – walks through New York for 10 minutes as a social experiment on how pervasive catcalling is at said location.

From 1907 to 1910, she was married to the popular songwriter and music publisher Tell Taylor. Six years after Taylor divorced her, Godman was arrested and released on bail for participating in a scheme to blackmail a wealthy widower. Godman attempted a scheme known as a \\"badger game,\\" which involved framing a victim in an embarrassing and illegal situation that resulted in a staged arrest by fake law enforcement officials. Godman posed as an unmarried woman being held against her will in a hotel room across state lines, which, if true, would have been a violation of the Mann Act. The ensuing fake arrest went awry when the victim reported the incident to authorities. In 1932, Godman, under the name of Helen Smith, was convicted for grand larceny and sentenced to prison in New York. Early life Buda was the daughter of a telegrapher and race track sheet-writer, Otho Godman. According to Jack Lait and Lee Mortimer, two former Chicago newspaper journalists, to protect her from growing up under bad influences, at age fifteen Buda was sent to St. Joseph’s Academy in Adrian, Michigan, a convent school. Her beauty was described as so fascinating that before maturity she stopped traffic on the streets. She was described as \\"petite, a wee trifle plump, with big steel-blue eyes, a tip-tilted nose, an oval face with a dimpled chin, a peewee mouth, and tiny hands and feet.\\" As late as 1950 she was remembered as the prettiest girl ever born and raised in Chicago. Other descriptions state that she was \\"a beautiful woman\\" and \\"a small brunette... exceeding pretty with plenty of snap.\\"  Criminal events  = 1916 blackmail scheme = Indicted co-conspirators: Buda Godman, Helen Evers, Homer T. French, William Butler, Doc Brady (alias James Christian), George Irwin In 1916, Godman, under the alias \\"Alice Williams,\\" persuaded Edward R. West, a wealthy business executive and widower from Hyde Park, Chicago, to travel with her from Chicago to New York City. West was the Vice President of the C. D. Gregg Tea and Coffee Company of St. Louis, Chicago, and New York. While \\"Miss Williams\\" and West were in their room at the Ansonia Hotel, two men, impersonating federal law enforcement agents, entered the room and \\"arrested\\" West for violation of the Mann Act. The men transported West and Godman back to Chicago and coerced West into paying them $15,000 to avoid prosecution, embarrassment, and damage to his and Alice's reputation. West reported the incident after becoming suspicious. Several of the male blackmailers were sentenced to prison. Godman was released on $10,000 bail ($877,000.00 in 2017) provided by two friends: Mrs. Susie Summerville and Mrs. Rene Bernice Morrow, née Martin. Morrow, in 1912, had been acquitted of the charge of murdering her husband. Summerville and Morrow forfeited bail when Godman skipped town and vanished for four years. In 1921, citing lack of evidence, the charges were dropped. Cecil Dudley Gregg (1867–1925) of St. Louis, who had no direct connection with the blackmail incident, was the founder and president of C. D. Gregg Tea & Coffee Co. This particular scheme is known as badger gaming — an extortion tactic where an attractive woman lures a wealthy man into a compromising position; an associate breaks in, takes some pictures, then they all sit down to haggle over the price. = Chattanooga = Buda, under the alias of Louise French, and Jack French were arrested February 2, 1921, in Chattanooga for producing and attempting to pass raised bills, a counterfeiting technique of gluing numerals onto low-denomination bills to make them look like higher denomination bills. = Denver = Godman was a paramour of the Jackie French (né John Homer French), bookmaker for Lou Blonger. = Havana, Cuba, and New York = After the 1916 scandal, up through the mid-1920s, Godman became the protege of Charles A. Stoneham, who, among other things, owned the New York Giants baseball club and, in Havana, Cuba, owned the Cuba-America Jockey Club, the Havana Casino, and the Oriental Park Racetrack. For years, Godman's Park Avenue apartment served as a stage for criminals that included Arnold Rothstein, the gambler; Owney Madden, the Bear King; race track notables, and Broadway climbers. To the other residents of the apartment house, she was known as Mrs. Stoneham; for others, she had other names; and meanwhile the 1916 blackmail charges in Chicago had been dropped. = 1932 Glemby jewelry heist = John Homer French at his arrest in 1922 In 1932, Godman, under the alias \\"Helen Smith,\\" was arrested and charged for an attempt to serve as a fence for $305,000 worth of stolen jewels from New York businessman Harry C. Glemby. On November 10, 1932, Godman was convicted for grand larceny and sentenced to prison in New York for four to eight years. She began her sentence on November 17, 1932, as prisoner number 1652 at the Auburn Prison and, with other inmates, was transferred on June 30, 1933, to the Bedford Hills Prison.

Otho had been a well-known telegraph operator and, in 1903, the first to operate a wireless telegraph on August 28, 1903, from a ship on Lake Michigan — the ship being the SS Milwaukee. Otho was also a horse race-sheet reporter, according to several sources. = Siblings = Godman had two older siblings: Hester Ann (1886–1923) and James Arthur (1887-1945). Hester accompanied her sister and Charles A. Stoneham on the trip to Cuba and its return. James followed his father in becoming a telegrapher. = Marriage = From 1907 to 1910, Godman was married to Chicago music publisher and composer Tell Taylor. They married November 4, 1907, in Chicago. Godman had met Taylor about two years prior when Taylor had been a dinner guest at the St. Joseph's Convent and Academy in Adrian, Michigan, where Helen had been attending school. Taylor had just started his songwriting career and was appearing with a traveling stage company in Adrian. Godman and Taylor had become good friends before dinner was over but did not correspond afterward. Two years later, while attending the performance of \\"The Girl Question,\\" by Howard, Adams, and Hough at the La Salle Theater in Chicago, Godman recognized Taylor and sent a note to him backstage, and they became reacquainted. After spending much of their time together lunching and dining during the following week, they met once again for dinner at a downtown Chicago hotel, and sent for a judge to marry them in the hotel's parlor. In 1910, Tell filed for divorce from Buda in Chicago. In late September of that year, the divorce was granted. In the proceedings, Tell accused Buda of having \\"affinities\\" with other vaudevillians and stated, \\"I married Buda when we both were drunk and I found out she was quite incapable of loyalty to anyone.\\"  Death  Under the name Helen Daniels, widow of Charles Daniels, Godman died January 7, 1945, in Queens, New York. At the time of her death, she lived at 38-19 50th Street in Sunnyside, Queens. She was buried Sunday, January 7, 1945, at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York, her grave-site marked by a simple and unassuming granite headstone.

These papers provided a description of the sailor and showed American citizenship. They were issued to American sailors to prevent them from being impressed on British men-of-war, during the period leading to and after the War of 1812. The certificates could be issued for a fee of 25 cents, and required proof of citizenship, although this was later changed to require only a notarized affidavit of citizenship. Protection papers were also offered to those who remained loyal to the crown during the American Revolution. The day Richard Stockton was captured, General William Howe had written a proclamation offering protection papers and a full and free pardon to those willing to remain in peaceable obedience to the king, George III. Although many took the pardon, Stockton never did and was marched to Perth Amboy, where he was put in irons, and treated as a common criminal.The Howe Brothers and the American Revolution; Ira D. Gruber; W.S. Norton and Company, Inc.; 1972 p. 195: \\"British officers and rebels agreed the proclamation of November 30 had been a failure.

Seaman's Protection Certificates In 1796, federal legislation regarding Seaman's Protection Certificates was enacted for merchant seamen.American Merchant Marine Timeline, 1789–2005 Freedom papers Because these protection papers were used to define freemen and citizenship, many black sailors and other men also used them to show that they were freemen if they were stopped by officials or slave catchers. They also called them \\"free papers\\" because they certified their non-slave status.Law in American History: Volume 1: From the Colonial Years Through the Civil War. p. 305. Many of the problems of these protection papers were that the descriptions were often vague or could apply to almost anyone. Frederick Douglass used a \\"protection paper\\" of a free black sailor to escape. He said: > \\"It was the custom in the State of Maryland to require of the free colored > people to have what were called free papers. This instrument they were > required to renew very often, and by charging a fee for this writing, > considerable sums from time to time were collected by the State. In these > papers the name, age, color, height and form of the free man were described, > together with any scars or other marks upon his person which could assist in > his identification. This device of slaveholding ingenuity, like other > devices of wickedness, in some measure defeated itself—since more than one > man could be found to answer the same general description.

It was therefore an act of supreme trust on the part of a > freeman of color thus to put in jeopardy his own liberty that another might > be free. It was, however, not infrequently bravely done, and was seldom > discovered. I was not so fortunate as to sufficiently resemble any of my > free acquaintances as to answer the description of their papers.

Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, Written by Himself. pp. > 245–246. A review of many of these protection papers reveals the number of black men who were sailors. \\"By 1800, about 18 percent of the one hundred thousand Americans at sea were African Americans. It is possible to trace the number of African Americans in vessels belonging to the United States (an unknown number sailed for other nations) because Seamen's Protection Certificates were drawn up for all \\"citizens\\"—as they specified, such that blacks used them to claim citizenship they were commonly denied—so that in theory they could not be seized by other nations. The records show great statistical variations depending on the port: In Philadelphia and Baltimore, the proportions of African Americans hovered around 15 percent from 1800 to 1860. New York's percentage fell from between 14 and 18 percent annually before 1830 to between 7 and 8 percent from 1830 to 1860; that of Savannah, Georgia, dropped from around 13 percent before 1830 to under 2 percent by 1836. The proportion of black mariners in New Orleans, Louisiana, also fell from averages in the high teens before 1820 to around 10 percent in the 1830s and between 1 and 7 percent in the 1840s and 1850s.Pencak, William. \\"Maritime Trades.\\" Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619–1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass. .

Seaman's Protection Certificate issued to James Forten Dunbar on 12 July 1810 at Philadelphia Pa.The 12 July 1810 protection certificate issued in Philadelphia (see thumbnail) identities the bearer as James Forten Dunbar,(1799 -1870) a “mulatto” (a person of mixed white and black ancestry) age eleven, and height 4’ 7’’ inches tall. Dunbar was described as having black hair and yellow complexion. He had a small pox inoculation scar on his left arm and on his right shin the mark of a dog bite. Dunbar was born a “free man of color” in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 1 July 1799. Dunbar was the fourth and last child of William Dunbar and Abigail Forten Dunbar. His mother Abigail was the sister of famed African American abolitionist and sail-maker James Forten. Dunbar’s father William died young, and it was his uncle, the renowned James Forten who signed for and made sure “Born Free” was included in the description. James Forten Dunbar attested the document by his X mark; it is unclear, if he ever became fully literate. Dunbar would later spend most of his life as a sailor and sail-maker,aboard merchant and naval vessels. During his long career he served aboard such naval vessels as the USS Constellation,USS Niagara, USS Brooklyn and the USS Tuscarora.

Prologue Magazine. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1). One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. \\"Frequently their \\"protection papers\\" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\\"Smith, Gene Allan. 2013.

Davis is described as a citizen of the United States, and a native of Princess Ann County, Virginia. Davis was listed as 23 years of age, five feet four inches, dark hair, hazel eyes, broad nose, round chin, pock marked face, and of dark complexion has a round scar above his left knee and one on the left eye brow. Davis tattoo's are described as are there locations on his body. He is listed as having in indian ink on his right arm a crucifix, a double heart with printed letters P.

Melville wrote “the Roman Catholic sailors on board had at least the crucifix pricked on their arm, and for this reason. If they chanced to die in a Catholic land they would be sure of a decent burial in consecrated ground…” Melville, Herman White Jacket or the World in a Man-of-War editor Thomas Tansselle (Library of America: New York 1983), 525 \\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\\"\\"The Ink of History\\" Discontinuance The Seamen's Protection Certificates were discontinued in the 1940s, as other forms of identification of American sailors were instituted.

York was built in 1902 by Bertram Iron Works of Toronto and assembled at Okanagan Landing. She was pre-fabricated with a steel hull and was twin-screw-driven. She was a small vessel in comparison to the many other ships on the lake; York was only 88 by 16 feet (27 by 4.9 metres). York was capable of moving 134 tons in freight and could carry up to 90 passengers. Purpose York was originally built to replace SS Victoria on Trout Lake in the Kootenays; however, SS Aberdeen was in need of a relief vessel. Aberdeen was in dire need of a refitting, hence York was launched on Lake Okanagan in 1902. After Aberdeen returned to Lake Okanagan, York provided way point service(service to location when called in)(online ref.) and worked as a tug boat, carrying cargo that had been clustered on the deck of Aberdeen. Although York was not intended to work as a tugboat, it pushed and pulled barges on Lake Okanagan during fruit season to move perishables to Okanagan Landing so they could be readied for shipment to markets. During the winter when the lake would freeze, York was used to break the ice for larger ships such as Aberdeen. York worked on Okanagan Lake until 1921, when she was relocated to Skaha Lake (Dog Lake), where York transported passengers on Skaha Lake and up the river channel in Penticton. Traveling up and down the channel was tedious and York frequently got stuck in sandbars. York retired when the railway between Penticton and Okanagan falls was complete, after which she was sold to Sid Leary (never put back into service) and eventually dismantled.  Operation York was launched in 1902 by the Canadian Pacific. York was only in service for thirty years, from 1902 to 1931. She worked on Lake Okanagan as a tugboat until 1921, when York was moved from Okanagan Lake to Skaha Lake. In 1931, she retired and was sold to a Sid Leary from Naramata. She was later dismantled and used for scrap.  Officer and crew complement  York was a comparatively small vessel, with two decks and a pilot house. The pilot house was the area from which the captain would steer the boat. York was a twin screw vessel, which means that the vessel had two propellers. Additionally, York had a tunnel hull, and the shallow hull allowed York to travel along the channel between Penticton and Skaha Lake. Throughout her career, York had many different people working aboard her. From 1904 to 1907, the captain of the ship was Captain J. Weeks, who had just earned his Master’s Certificate. This was Weeks’ first captain job. He would later go on to become the captain of Aberdeen and Sicamous, in that order. In 1913, according to Canadian Railway and Marine World, York was captained by M. Reid, and her chief engineer was A. McLena.  Comparison York was not a luxurious passenger ship like Aberdeen, but she could carry up to 90 passengers. She did not have many decks, but only what was necessary for her basic operation. York was a small, modest ship that was useful to serve the smaller communities, particularly on Skaha Lake, but was too small and slow to replace Aberdeen. She also lacked the power to act as a proper tugboat on Lake Okanagan. Although she was small, her size was advantageous when working on Skaha Lake and traveling up the channel.

Summary After being trapped in an isolated car crash, the life of elderly widower Ira Levinson becomes entwined with a young college student, Sophia Danko, and the cowboy whom she loves, a young man named Luke Collins. The novel is told through the perspectives of these three characters as they go through their lives, both separately and together. Ira Levinson, ninety-one years old and already in poor health, is just holding on; remaining alert only because his wife Ruth, who has died, appears as an image to help him remember their life together: how they met, the paintings they collected and the dark days of World War II. Just a few miles away, Sophia, a student at Wake Forest college, is about to have her life change forever as she meets an unexpected love, Luke. Luke is a cowboy and risk-taking bull-rider, unlike anyone she has ever known. Together they experience the joys of love as well as the difficulties that come with Luke's dangerous career. Two couples who have little in common, yet whose lives will converge with unexpected poignancy.

He was a longtime figure in minor league baseball in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Biography Humphries' playing career in professional baseball spanned 1907 to 1918. A second baseman and shortstop, he had a career-best .277 batting average in 1916, compiling 136 hits in 136 games with the McAlester Miners of the Western Association, although batting records for multiple of his seasons are incomplete. He appeared in at least 376 minor league games during a 10-season playing career. Humphries was a player-manager with the Bonham Boosters in 1911, the Sherman Cubs in 1912, the Sherman Lions in 1913, and the McAlester Miners from 1915 to 1917. He led the Miners to a first-place finish in 1917. In 1919, Humphries was hired as the Oklahoma City Indians team secretary and in 1920, he briefly managed the team. He served as the team's business manager in the 1930s and 1940s, and in 1948, he became the team's president. In 1951, Humphries bought the franchise and became its owner. He signed pitcher Bill Greason in 1952, making Greason the second African American player in the Texas League. Humphries owned the team through 1957; it folded when the Texas League reorganized after that season. All told, Humphries was with the Oklahoma City Indians for 39 years, \\"one of the longest careers with a single franchise in baseball history.\\" In 1958, Humphries moved his franchise to Corpus Christi, Texas, to become the Corpus Christi Giants, and remained owner. He later had a stake in the Victoria Giants of the Texas League. Humphries was born in Waco, Texas, and attended Baylor University.

History  The name of the monastery is derived from the name of the island. The monastery was mentioned in the chapter issued by Balša III in 1417 by which he granted a salt evaporation pond to the monastery. It was built after 1400, probably between 1403 and 1417. The monastery was so poor in the 17th century that in 1665 its hegumen, together with hegumen and monks from Vranjina Monastery, requested help from Catholic bishop of Scutari Pjetër Bogdani. During Montenegrin-Ottoman war in 1853 monastery was attacked by Ottoman forces. Defended by three Leković brothers: Mališa, Savo and Andrija from the nearby Godinje village who were badly outnumbered, it was eventually captured while his defenders according to a local folklore died a heroic death.http://www.in4s.net/obnova-manastira-crkava-u-crnoj-gori-u-vrijeme- mitropolita-amfilohija-manastir-moracnik/ Until 1997, when the first liturgy was done, the monastery was defunct.

Individual plants may be up to tall, and consist of sharp spiky yellowish-green leaves. A. aurea is found throughout the South Island of New Zealand, usually in mountainous areas but also lower altitude dry well drained grassland sites. It is found at altitudes of . The aurea part of the name refers to the distinctive golden colour of the plant. Golden Spaniard flowers from January to February with a yellow or cream colour. The flowerhead is very spiky, quite large and solid. Taxonomy Common name/s: golden Spaniard, golden speargrass. Full scientific name: Aciphylla aurea W.R.B.Oliv. Description Aciphylla aurea is easy to identify through many features. One of the features that makes it easy to identify is its very robust tufted flower head, which grows up to 1.5m when in flower (November-December) and which can remain for up to two years. The flowers of this plant are uniquely yellow, and star shaped, in configuration. The plants have a yellowish-green- golden colour on its leaves that are clumped together. The plant fruits between the months of January-February. The leaves are pinnate and grow up to 70 cms long with thin margins. The difference between a male pant and female plant is that the flower clumps are distributed differently. Distribution and habitat Natural global range – Aciphylla aurea is indigenous to New Zealand alpine regions so it is not found anywhere else in the world. But it has some similarities to plants of the same Genus in different countries. New Zealand range – Aciphylla aurea is found mainly throughout the east coast of South Island (Marlborough- Nelson to Northern Southland) in low to medium alpine regions at roughly 300–1,500 m above sea level. The other Aciphylla species live throughout New Zealand, in different environments, due to their size and adaptions, to their specific environments Habitat preferences – Aciphylla aurea is found in mountainous habitats, in well-drained soils including habitats like rocky outcrops, and tussock grasslands. Aciphylla aurea also has a high tolerance for extreme weather conditions, tolerating fires and temperatures of -17 degrees. Because of this extreme tolerance it now dominates much of the alpine grasslands and tussock grasslands. Life cycle/phenology Aciphylla aurea flowers in New Zealand in the early summer months (November December), but this plant flowers prolifically only every few years, not every year and fruits in the late summer months (January - February). This means that it is pollinated by animals. The seeds of this species Aciphylla use aneomochory (wind dispersal), this is because the seed of the plant has a high surface area to volume ratio, as found in many alpine species due to the exposure to the elements. This wind dispersal method of winged projections is not that common among plant species, but it enhances the dispersal by wind, and allows the host plant to spread its seeds further, due to this many of the seeds have a paper like texture. The seeds of this plant are usually dark brown in colour and roughly 5.0mm- 7.0mm long. There are some slight differences that sometimes occur between populations of this species in Marlborough/Nelson region and the rest of the population, this variation includes the colour of the seeds being more golden (brown) than dark brown. It is not known how long the seeds remain viable in the soil, although there has been a lot of study on this species not much is known about its germination. Ecology Habitat – Golden speargrass prefers well-drained alpine soils, which are windswept and prone to extreme temperatures, such as dry grasslands, and tussock grasslands. This species of Aciphylla prefers drier climates compared to some of its relatives, this might be due to their size and overall tolerance. Predators, parasites, and diseases - It was believed that before human introduced predators such as sheep and any browsers (bovines) that the main predator of this species was Moa. The browsers that prey on them eat there long colourful leaves rather than the flower stalks because of the height of the leaves compared to the flowers. Although since the sheep have been introduced the Golden Spaniard has become more sheep tolerant, and therefore is one of the reasons why, it now dominates the high country tussock and grasslands.

John Ridley is now accepted as its inventor, though John Wrathall Bull argued strongly for the credit. Description The stripper plucks the ears of grain (generally wheat) without winnowing, and leaving the straw standing. The first strippers were drawn by bullocks and consisted of a large, wheeled, box-like machine with a row of spiked prongs in front and with a long pole at the back of the machine for steering. It had the advantage over the early reaper machines in being able to reap more quickly (of benefit in a hot climate) and having fewer components subject to wearing out. The first strippers were improved by adding a beater to knock the heads off the stems. The machines became headers. Later headers had reciprocating cutter bars at the back of the combs to cut the stems just short of the heads. A stripper-harvester also winnowed the grain, removing the chaff. Notable manufacturers were Sunshine Harvester, J. and D. Shearer and Mellor Bros. (who specialised in \\"bike strippers\\", ie. light enough to be drawn by a bicycle). Evolution of the header The Gallic reaper that is seen in Roman times, in the first three centuries of the current era led to the stripper developed in the 19th century. The Gallic reaper had a comb at the front to collect grain heads. An operator would knock the heads into a tray for collection. The stripper developed in South Australia used the principles, with a comb at the front, using a mechanical beater to knock the heads off. Later innovations were including a cutter bar similar to the binder reaper and an elevator to lift the heads into a storage bin for later threshing. The combined header- harvester added the winnower to thresh the grain from the heads.

Jenkins (born March 11, 1960 in Manhattan, New York) is an American writer of popular spiritual books including the international bestseller The Return of the Inka: A Journey of Initiation and INKA Prophecies for 2012. She is a licensed psychotherapist, cultural investigator and worldwide teacher of the Inca tradition. Jenkins earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota in 1983, and a Master of Arts degree in Integral Counseling Psychology graduating in 1987 from the California Institute of Integral Studies, San Francisco. In 1988 she began a Doctor of Philosophy degree in integral counseling from the institute, only to be inexplicably called to abandon her studies for a quest to Peru. In 1988, Jenkins traveled to Peru, where she experienced a spiritual awakening, which she described in her spiritual autobiographies: The Return of The Inka: A Journey of Initiation and INKA Prophecies for 2012 and Journey to Q'eros: Golden Cradle of the Inka. During this time she met the man who would become her teacher and guide, Juan Nunez del Prado, the foremost expert on the Andean Mystical Tradition. In 1990 she received the Hatun Qarpay – The Great Initiation Ritual. This ancient ritual springs out of the 16,000-year-old tradition of nature mysticism in the Andes – designed to bring the individual into direct, intimate and mystical relationship to the Divine through Great Nature herself. From 1992–1996, she served as Juan Nunez del Prado's apprentice working intensely with him initiating groups from all over the world in Cuzco, Peru. In 1997, with the publication of her first book, she independently facilitated her first Hatun Qarpay. Since then, Jenkins has initiated close to 1,000 people into the Hatun Qarpay becoming a skilled, spiritually proficient and an adept Inka guide. In May 2010, Elizabeth served as technical advisor and guide to the DISCOVERY CHANNEL's Les Stroud Beyond Survival into the Andean mountains to join the Q'ero Indians on their yearly pilgrimage to the holy site of Qollorit'i. In August 2013, she published The Fourth Level: Nature Wisdom Teachings of the Inka. This book is the culmination of close to twenty –five years of exploration into the InkaNature Mysticism. The Fourth Level is a primer on Nature Intelligence informed by the fourth-level teachings of Inka Nature Mysticism. It is a book for general consumption that translates the worldview of the Q'ero Indians and the Seven Energy Principles within the larger context of Inka Mysticism to the public. The book includes 7 Inka practices that allow the individual to experience each one of the principles directly. Jenkins tours internationally as a speaker on spirituality and mysticism, is a frequent lecturer to groups on eco-psychology, creativity, and spiritual experience. The Wiraqocha Foundation Jenkins is also the Founder and Chief Missions Officer of The Wiraqocha Foundation, a nonprofit educational and service organization established in 1996 for the preservation and promulgation of indigenous wisdom and knowledge systems. The Foundation's purpose is four-fold: to help humanity remember their divine connection to Mother Nature – serving as a bridge from the Third and Fourth Level; to put Fourth Level principles into action – bringing people and nature together through education, service and sami and to facilitate global scientific, technological, cultural and spiritual exchange and connection between all of the sons of daughters of Pachamama. Through these interchanges, indigenous traditions are honored and preserved; and North America society is enriched and expanded. Since its inception, the Wiraqocha Foundation has assisted in preserving the ancient cultural art of weaving, built a much needed school, funded critical medical missions, financed a clean water project, provided scholarship funds to send Q’ero children to schools, sponsored Teach Peru and constructed three green houses. PAQO Network Jenkins was also instrumental in creating the PAQO Network, a global spiritual group composed of regional affiliates whose purpose is to help evolve human consciousness from the Third Level to the Fourth Level. This will be accomplished through the pragmatic application of Inka Practices on a Worldwide level to resolve conflicts and increase harmonious relationships between Humans and Nature The Fourth Level Jenkins interpretation of the Inka prophecy is that The Fourth Level is a much needed level of spiritual consciousness one of a true adult that is based on love, trust and integrity with the natural world. It is distinct from the Third Level which characterizes our current society that is based in fear, greed, and is he level of the adolescent. The Planet’s current reality is the outcome of man’s belief of the primacy of matter over energy, man over nature, and the dichotomy of \\"good and evil. The Fourth Level is an energetic space that can be accessed through ritual initiation and cooperative relationship with Mother Nature. Through cooperation with Mother Nature, humans will be able to bring about love,peace, harmony and sustainability. Fourth Level initiates are known by their generosity, service to humanity, their ability to mediate conflict and bring about healing and peace in human and human/nature relationships. Personal Elizabeth lives with her partner Barney and their two sons on an organic FARM on the Big Island of Hawaii where she writes and conducts intensives and workshops on the subjects of: Introduction to the Inka Knowledge and Spiritual Wisdom Systems, Eco- Psychology of the Inka Tradition, and Nature Intelligence.

It is a gram-negative, non-motile, facultative lithoauthotropic bacterium that was discovered in Moscow, Russia in 1995. The genus name, Nitrospira, originates from the prefix “nitro” derived from nitrite, the microbe’s electron donor and “spira” meaning coil or spiral derived from the microbe’s shape. The species name, moscoviensis, is derived from Moscow, where the species was first discovered. N. moscoviensis could potentially be used in the production of bio-degradable polymers.  History  In 1995, Silke Ehrich discovered Nitrospira moscoviensis in a sample taken from an eroded iron pipe. The pipe was a part of a heating system in Moscow, Russia. The rust was transferred to a culture where cells could be isolated. For optimum growth, Ehrich and his team cultivated the cells on a mineral salt medium at a temperature of 39 °C and at a pH of 7.6-8.0.  Morphology  Nitrospira moscoviensis is classified as being gram-negative, non-motile, and having a curved rod shape. The curved rods are approximately 0.9-2.2 µm long x 0.2-0.4 µm wide. N. moscoviensis can exist in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and reproduces using binary fission. Defining features of N. moscoviensis is the absence of intra- cytoplasmic membranes and carboxysomes possession of a flatulent periplasmic space.  Metabolism  Nitrospira moscoviensis is a facultative lithoautotroph commonly referred to as a chemolithoautotroph. In aerobic environments, N. moscoviensis obtains energy by oxidizing nitrite to nitrate. Without the element molybdenum, the nitrite-oxidizing system will not function. When N. moscoviensis is in nitrite free environments it can use aerobic hydrogen oxidation. When N. moscoviensis reduces nitrite using hydrogen as an electron donor growth is blocked. A key difference in N. moscoviensis’ nitrite-oxidizing system is location; unlike most nitrate oxidizing systems, it is not located in the cytoplasmic membrane. Kirstein and Bock (1993) implied that the location of the nitrite-oxidizing system corresponds directly to N. moscoviensis having an enlarged periplasmic space. By oxidizing nitrate outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, a permease nitrite system is not needed for the proton gradient. The exocytoplasmic oxidation of nitrite also prevents build-up of toxic nitrite within the cytoplasm. Another important metabolism ability for N. moscoviensis is its ability to cleave urea to ammonia and CO2. The ability to use urea comes directly from the presence of urease encoding genes which is interesting because most nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are unable to use ammonia as an energy source. Urease encoding genes function by catalyzing urea hydrolysis to form ammonia and carbamate.  Ecology  Nitrospira moscoviensis grows in temperatures from 33 to 40 °C and pH 7.6-8.0 with an optimal nitrite concentration of 0.35 nM. Nitrospira moscoviensis plays a key role in the two-step Nitrogen Cycle process. The first step of Nitrification requires an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium (AOB) or ammonia-oxidizing archaeon (AOA) followed by a nitrite-oxidizing bacterium (NOB). The unique capability of N. moscoviensis to cleave urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide allows for a symbiotic relationship with ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM) that lack this urease-production ability also known as negative AOM. A correlation in environment preferences between Nitrospira species with nxrB gene encoding the β-subunit of nitro-oxidoreductase and AOM species with amoA gene further confirmed this relationship. N. moscoviensis provides ammonia via hydrolysis of urea to these ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms which in turn produce nitrite, the primary energy source of N. moscoviensis. The relationship between ureolytic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and negative AOM is called reciprocal feeding. Thus far, Nitrospira species have been recognized in natural environments as the primary vehicle for nitrite oxidation including soils, activated-sludge, ocean and fresh water, hot springs, and water treatment plants.  Genomics  Following its isolation, N. moscoviensis’s genome was sequenced by Dr. Ehrich et al. Its 4.59 Mb genome has a GC content of 56.9+/-0.4 mol% with a predicted 4,863 coding sequences. N. moscoviensis's 16S rRNA gene sequences were found to be 88.9% similar to N. marina’s. Despite its relatively low similarity to N. marina, N. moscoviensis was classified within the Nitrospirae phylum primarily due to shared morphological features including the presence of an enlarged periplasmic space. N. moscoviensis’s fully sequenced genome has provided useful phylogenetic insights beyond the scope of 16S rRNA sequence studies. The discovery of the gene encoding the β-subunit of nitrite-oxidoreductase, nxrB, from N. moscoviensis as a functional genetic marker of Nitrospira, not only confirmed previous 16S rRNA phylogenetic classifications within the phylum, but revealed a new understanding of Nitrospira’s richness in terrestrial environments. The phylum has expanded from two bacteria, N. marina and N. moscoviensis, to a 6-branched genera composed of a characteristically diverse group of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria with N. moscoviensis positioned in lineage II.  Biotechnology  The cytoplasm of Nitrospira moscoviensis contains polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules.

L. paracasei is a bacterium that operates by commensalism. It is commonly found in many human habitats such as human intestinal tracts and mouths as well as sewages, silages, and previously mentioned dairy products. The name includes morphology, a rod-shaped (bacillus shape) bacterium with a width of 2.0 to 4.0μm and length of 0.8 to 1.0μm. So far, thirty four different strains of L. paracasei have been isolated from a variety of environments. Sixteen of those strains have been isolated from dairy, ten from plants, and eight from human and animal gastrointestinal tracts. L. paracasei is genotypically and phenotypically indistinguishable from other members of its genus such as Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. However, they are easily differentiated from each other by their fermentation profiles. Its fermentative properties allows it to be used as biological food processors and supplements for diets and medical disorders, especially in the gastrointestinal tract. Although probiotics are considered safe, they may cause bacteria-host interactions and adverse health consequences. In certain cases there is a risk of bacteremia when probiotics are used. Currently, the probiotic strain, frequency, dose and duration of the probiotic therapies are not established.  Physiology  Lactobacillus paracasei is a gram-positive, facultatively heterofermentative, non-spore forming microorganism. The cells of L. paracasei are typically rod shaped, with a size range of 2.0μm to 4.0μm in width, and 0.8 to 1.0μm in length. The organism is nonmotile. L. paracasei cells often have square ends, and may exist either in single form or in chains. L. paracasei grows optimally in a temperature range between 10 and 37 °C. No growth takes place above 40 °C. The organism is able to survive for approximately 40 seconds in a maximum temperature of 72 °C. As L. paracasei is facultatively heterofermentative: lactic acid is produced from most strains. L. paracasei exist as a common inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract as part of the normal flora. Naturally fermented vegetables, milk, and meat may also contain strains of L. paracasei.  Phylogeny  Lactobacillus paracasei belongs to kingdom Bacteria. L. paracasei is part of the division Firmicutes, and also belongs to the class Bacilli. The order and family are Lactobacillales and Lactobacillaceae respectively. The argument on the nomenclature of L. paracasei versus L. casei has been one of intense debate. Most of the species profiled as L. casei or L. paracasei have been found to be part of the same species. In 1989, it was proposed that L. paracasei be designated a subspecies (paracasei) to account for the species that it shares DNA homology with. It has been shown their names have been used interchangeably in scientific literature. 16S RNA sequence homology has confirmed the relatedness between these species. Historically, the difference between Lactobacillus paracasei and other lactobacilli has been based on biochemical characteristics. There is an approximately 90% sequence identity between casei, paracasei, and rhamnosus. However, there are some differential criteria that are commonly used to differentiate between them. These differential criteria include nutritional requirements and growth environment. L. paracasei has been found to show specific differences with other Lactobacillus spp. in that it is somewhat heat resistant, grows well in ripening cheese, and it has high proteolytic activity. L. paracasei has been found to have 34 strains. These strains have been isolated from various countries around the world. Although there is a small correlation between phylogenetic relatedness and origin of isolation, currently there is not enough evidence to support direct proof of the relationship.  Genomics  L. paracasei's genome contains circular DNA and varies slightly among the different strains isolated. On average, the genomes are 2.9 to 3.0 million base pairs (commonly abbreviated Mb). It has a GC-content between 46.2 and 46.6% and is predicted to encode about 2800 to 3100 proteins. The difference in the genomes of these strains lies in variant cell envelopes, secretory proteins, and polysaccharides. Many of the commonly coded proteins are cell- surface associated cell-wall hydrolases that protect the cell against apoptosis. These enzymes have been shown to provide cellular protection to human epithelial cells. Genetic diversity for the different L. paracasei genomes was assessed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). MLST is a technique used for classifying microbes by the use of DNA fragments from essential genes of the organism. AFLP is a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tool used in DNA profiling to amplify a desired DNA fragment with the use of restriction enzymes and ligands.  Clinical and research applications Lactobacillus paracasei has been identified as a bacterium that has probiotic properties. L. paracasei is a part of the normal human gut microbiota. L. paracasei IMPC2.1 may be a chemoprophylactic in gastrointestinal cells. Gastrointestinal cells are susceptible to apoptosis and cell growth from both heat-killed and viable IMPC2.1 strains. L. paracasei 8700:2 has been isolated from healthy human gastrointestinal mucosa and human feces. Strain 8700:2 was also found to inhibit Salmonella enterica and Helicobacter pylori, two pathogens commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract. Strain 8700:2 breaks down oligofructose and inulin, while also growing rapidly on both and producing lactic acid as the end product. A formulation of live bacteria including L. paracasei may be used in combination with conventional therapies to treat ulcerative colitis. A systematic review provided significant evidence of beneficial clinical and immunologic effects of L. paracasei LP-33 strains in the treatment of Allergic rhinitis. Lipoteichoic acid from the cell wall of a heat killed Lactobacillus paracasei D3-5 ameliorates aging-related leaky gut, inflammation and improves physical and cognitive functions in mice  Health concerns  The manipulation of the gut microbiota is complex and may cause bacteria-host interactions. Although probiotics are considered safe, when they are used by oral administration there is a risk of passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) and subsequent bacteremia, which can cause adverse health consequences. Some people, such as those with immune compromise, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, cardiac valve disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events. Currently, the probiotic strain, frequency, dose and duration of the probiotic therapy are not established. Live bacteria might not be essential because of beneficial effects of probiotics seems to be mediated by their DNA and by secreted soluble factors, and their therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic administration rather than oral administration.  History  LAB (Lactic Acid Bacteria) were classified and grouped in the early 1900s after gaining scientists' attention after observing the bacteria's interactions in different foods, especially dairy products. In 1991, Martinus Beijerinck, a Dutch microbiologist, separated Lactobacillus as gram positive bacteria from the previously known LAB group. L. paracasei has been recently classified as a part of the Lactobacillus casei group of probiotics. However, it has no clear taxonomic position. The name L. paracasei was proposed for rejection in 1996 by Dicks, Duplessis, Dellaglio, and Lauer.

Forests Government legislation protects about 8 percent of the forested area, of which less than 1 percent is logged annually; this latter portion is required to be reforested after being harvested. It is one of the five countries with the largest amount of forest, along with Russia, Brazil, China and the US; together, these countries control more than half of the world's forested land area. According to the FAO bureaucracy, forests and forestry in Canada are managed by Natural Resources Canada, which controls natural resources issues, and the Canadian Forest Service, which conducts research and coordinates forestry policy at the national level. Forests were controlled until about 2010 by the provincial governments under the Division of Powers in Part VI of the Constitution Act, 1867. The governments are assisted by the National Advisory Board on Forest Research, established in 1997 and focusing on strategic issues, and the Forest Sector Advisory Council, which represents the interests of the multitude of private, non-profit and academic stakeholders in Canadian forestry. The Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, composed of 14 ministers representing the federal government and the various provinces and territories, is the main tool for dissemination of national and international policy throughout the country. History of forestry European forestry in Canada is thought to date back to the 11th century, when Leif Erikson first landed off the coast of what is believed to be Newfoundland.Ingstad, Helge; Ingstad, Anne Stine (2001). The Viking Discovery of America: The Excavation of a Norse Settlement in L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland. Checkmark Books. . Large scale forestry did not begin until European settlers landed several centuries later. The area that is now Canada experienced significant deforestation during the 18th and 19th centuries, as a booming population of settlers cleared the land; this pattern was also seen elsewhere in North America. Changes in management strategies in the 20th and 21st centuries have been able to halt the trend toward deforestation. Forestry today Forestry is a major industry in Canada, contributing over $24.6 billion in GDP to the economy in 2017. In the same year, over 209,940 people were directly employed by the forestry industry, contributing 1.1 percent of total employment. The majority of forestry employees are found in Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario, and for the most part they work in the softwood trade. Conifer release programmes have been perfected in Canada since the 1950s. As of 2011, Canada contributed 10 percent of the world's sawnwood, 10 percent of the pulp for paper, 9 percent of the industrial roundwood, 4 percent of the wood-based panels and 3 percent of the paper and paperboard. In 2010, Canada enjoyed a significant surplus in their balance of trade, mainly due to being the second-largest exporter of forestry products globally. Much of this is exported, with Canada exporting 20 percent of the world's sawnwood, 18 percent of the pulp for paper, 8 percent of the paper and paperboard, 5 percent of the industrial roundwood and 5 percent of the wood-based panels. Environmental concerns Mountain slopes in Kootenay National Park, British Columbia, showing extensive fire damage to forested area Canada's ecosystems depend on large forested areas, making much of massive resource unusable without ecological collapse. Canada is a participant in several international protocols and conferences in areas that affect its forested land. As a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required, although there is some concern about the scientific reasoning behind some of the specific targets that Canada has chosen. Biotechnology and its effect on forested land is a concern, and the conservation of the forest's biological diversity is a major priority. The latter was the subject of the country's first Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity report. Much of the valuable western lodgepole pine stock has been destroyed in recent years by the mountain pine beetle, which has thrived due to a combination of large stands of mature pine and successive warm winters. As of 2009, it was estimated that over of pine had been infested in British Columbia alone. While extensive logging, prescribed burning and pest reduction techniques have been used to attempt to contain the beetle, large stands of dead trees remain, posing a significant threat of wildfire. Annually, Canada sees around 8,000 wildfires, burning a total of on average. Over half of these are caused by humans, but nature- caused fires (generally started by lightning strikes) cover over 80 percent of the total burn area, as they are often in remote areas of the country.

It is the 77th Oswald film created during the Lantz era and the 128th to feature the character. Plot Oswald runs a shop where commuters leave their young children to be watched by him while they have to be someplace else separately. One day, a lady collie comes to drop someone at the shop. Her submitted child is none other than the boy beagle. The boy beagle feels unsure of the place he's in. He then goes to interact with the other youngsters, particularly a girl gibbon. Because the girl gibbon is often glum, he gives her a couple of milk bottles. To entertain her and everybody else there, the boy beagle encourages them to dance. The girl gibbon dances very joyously and therefore accelerates her movements. She dances so fast that the floor she is standing on ignites. A fire started forming on the floors. The fire in the short was not in animation, it is a clip of real fire from the fireplace. Meanwhile, outside, the children's guardians gathered as it is time to pick them up. When Oswald reenters the shop, he is shocked to see the interior ablaze. He is able to salvage most of the children from the burning place using a vacuum cleaner. But while he saves them, Oswald succumbs to the smoky atmosphere and collapses. The boy beagle comes to his rescue, and uses the vacuum to pull him out. The little dog then exits the place in the same way. The vacuum bag somehow makes its way outdoors where it bursts, thus releasing Oswald and the youngsters. The guardians pick up their children, and walk away happy. Oswald is greeted again by the lady collie who commends him for his heroic deed. The boy beagle later tries to interrupt Oswald but got kicked by the heel of Oswald's foot.

A Grumman F7F Tigercat flies over Armitage Field. Project Camel encompassed the work performed by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in support of the Manhattan Project during World War II. These activities included the development of detonators and other equipment, testing of bomb shapes dropped from Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, and the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, where explosive components of nuclear weapons were manufactured. Background In the early 1930s, an emergency landing field was built by the Works Progress Administration in the Mojave Desert near the small town of Inyokern, California. Opened in 1935, it was acquired by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in 1942, and became part of the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range. In 1943, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) contracted with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) for the testing and evaluation of rockets for the Navy. A suitable test area was required for this near Pasadena, California, so the area was transferred from the Army to the Navy in October 1943, and commissioned as the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) in December 1943. Workshops, laboratories and facilities were constructed for over 600 men. During 1944, NOTS worked on the development and testing of the 3.5-inch, 5-inch, HVAR and 11.75-inch (Tiny Tim) rockets. By late 1944, rocket development and testing work began to taper off, and production models started to reach the Navy and USAAF in quantity. The director of the OSRD, Vannevar Bush saw an opportunity to use some of the expertise at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with, the Manhattan Project. Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen, the head of the rocket team at Caltech, to visit the Los Alamos Laboratory, and meet with the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the laboratory director, Robert Oppenheimer, and senior scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory. Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war. In addition to its scientists, Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team, headed by Trevor Gardner. This group worked closely with its counterpart at Los Alamos, which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Lockridge. Codename All the work done at NOTS on behalf of the Manhattan Project came under the codename Project \\"Camel\\". The name is said to have come from a remark by a Los Alamos scientist that once a camel (meaning Caltech) gets its nose under a tent flap it is hard to dislodge. Manhattan Project =Drop testing= The Manhattan Project conducted an extensive series of drop tests to evaluate various bomb shapes. These were initially conducted with scale models of the bomb dropped from a Grumman TBF Avenger at the US Navy test range at Dahlgren, Virginia starting in August 1943. A new airfield was constructed at NOTS, using Manhattan Project funding, with three runways, , and long, and wide to accommodate the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Fuel storage was provided with a capacity of of gasoline and of oil. It was opened on 1 June 1945, and named Armitage Field after Navy Lieutenant John Armitage, who was killed while testing a Tiny Tim rocket at NOTS in August 1944. Three B-29s were based at Armitage for drop testing. Caltech's Gerald Kron developed instrumentation to evaluate the test drops, which were made by aircraft based at NOTS, Muroc and Wendover Army Air Field. Getting the Fat Man to fall properly was quite difficult. One officer described it as: The resolution of the problem involved extensive testing with various fin configurations. Commander Chick Hayward initially thought that test bombs dropped at NOTS would be easier to recover than those dropped on the sands at Wendover, but they proved to have considerable ability to penetrate the desert floor, and required no less digging out. The commander of Project Alberta, Captain Deak Parsons, had four bomb assembly kits produced. These kits were fully contained facilities, which included a number of Quonset huts with air conditioning. Two were shipped to the Pacific island of Tinian, where the atomic bombs were assembled. One was kept as a spare at Wendover, and one was erected at Inyokern, where it was used to assemble the explosive but non-nuclear pumpkin bombs for testing. =Detonators= The design of the Fat Man required that a number of explosive lenses had to be detonated simultaneously. After learning from Luis Alvarez that the Los Alamos Laboratory had encountered problems with the supply of the exploding bridgewire detonators required for this, Lauritsen found manufacturers in the Los Angeles area that could produce them. Alvarez ordered the detonators by the thousand. They were used in the bomb, but most were expended in various diagnostic tests required to verify that the detonators and the lenses worked perfectly. Responsibility for the development and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order. =Salt Wells Pilot plant= Salt Wells Pilot Plant in August 1946 The explosive lenses required by the Fat Man had to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, as it was a former sawmill. Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it only a matter of time before it blew up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings about this, because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety. Groves and Parsons met with Lauritsen and Bruce Sage, who had built the China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made, and it was agreed that Caltech would build and operate the plant. A site was chosen in the Salt Wells Valley and work commenced on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent, at a cost of $13 million. Groves wanted the plant working within 100 days. While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components for one or two bombs, it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the months to come. Complicating the construction program was the fact that Los Alamos had not finalized what processes would be used. Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant involved its own challenges. Some facilities had to be fabricated for the purpose. Some items were hard to locate, while others were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945. After the war After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Under Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, sent a telegram to \\"all the men and women employed on the Camel Project\\": Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to the cold weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was completed in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects in the form of cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks. The temporary nature of the accommodation was no longer acceptable after the war, and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which took over from the Manhattan Project on 1 January 1947, spent $3.252 million on 380 sets of family quarters, streets, electricity, sewers, mains water, and a small school, which was named after Groves, and opened in 1948. Improved techniques and facilities allowed the plant to triple its output in 1947. By 1949, the pilot plant employed over 700 people. The pilot plant helped design, equip and train workers for the new Burlington AEC Plant, which took over responsibility for manufacturing the explosive lenses. The Salt Wells Pilot Plant was closed in 1954.

After financial losses incurred by the big-budget fantasy series The Legend (2007) and Faith (2012), Kim was under investigation when he committed suicide in 2013. Career =Beginnings= Kim Jong-hak was born on November 5, 1951 in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, the fourth son of seven siblings. While attending Hwimun High School, he won an Excellence Award at the National High School Theater Competition in 1966. =MBC training= After he graduated from Kyung Hee University with a Journalism degree, he joined the broadcasting network MBC in 1977. This was a period when the South Korean television industry was undergoing a creative transition with the launch of color broadcasts and ENG cameras, and the new format of short dramas adapted from famous novels, MBC's Bestseller Theater (베스트셀러극장). Like most newbie production directors (called by the title \\"PD\\" in Korea), Kim slowly climbed up the ranks by assisting veterans, getting the occasional producer credit on Chief Inspector (수사반장), the 1981 landmark police procedural starring Choi Bool-am. =Early works= Kim became an assistant director on one of the historical dramas (called sageuk in Korean) of his mentor Lee Byung-hoon, Royal Emissary (암행어사). In the following years, Kim would direct in all sorts of genres and formats, building versatility that would come in handy about a decade later. In 1983, he told the story of legendary pansori pioneer Shin Chae-hyo in 1983's The Jester (광대가) by Lee Eun-seong, one of the many three-episode experiments that would eventually lead to the birth of miniseries in 1987; he again worked with Lee the same year in the short Gosanja Kim Jeong-ho (고산자 김정호, 1983), a biopic of the notorious late Joseon cartographer, and then moved on to Dasan Jeong Yak- yong (다산 정약용, 1983), written by another sageuk pioneer, Im Choong; he was even entrusted the June 25 special (commemorating the Korean War) which adapted Jo Jung-rae's The Gates of Men (인간의 문) for the small screen, a tale of a left- wing partisan's guilt 20 years after his war crimes. It would take him until 1986 to debut as a bonafide director for an entire series, by taking over for Lee Byung-hoon in MBC's sageuk franchise 500 Years of Joseon (조선왕조 500년), of which Kim directed The Hoechun Gate (회천문; he shared co-directing credits with Lee) and Namhan Fortress (남한산성). But 1987 and 1988 were the years that cemented him as one of Yeouido's most important young directors, not only because of his style and versatility but also his eclectic choices. He helmed the first of many Kim Seong-jong adaptations with Beautiful Affair (아름다운 밀회), about the power struggle that ensues after the death of a powerful company chairman. =Collaboration with Song Ji-na= That same year he met Song Ji- na, a former radio drama scripter, and they would famously collaborate on eight dramas. Their first work together was The Last Station (퇴역전선), an eight- episode miniseries (one of the first of the format) set in the 1970s and adapted from a Huh Young-man manhwa, followed by their second series Teacher, Teacher, Our Teacher (선생님 선생님 우리 선생님). But their partnership blossomed with Human Market (인간시장), adapted from Kim Hong-shin's bestseller and which became one of the classics of 1980s Korean TV (SBS would later remake it in 2004). Among the cast of Human Market was actor Park Sang-won, who would continue to work with Kim and Song through the years. Eyes of Dawn But Kim's true breakthrough came with Eyes of Dawn. To celebrate MBC's 30th anniversary, Song and Kim adapted Kim Seong-jong's 10-volume novel (published in 1981), embarking on a drama that would make Korean television history. Eyes of Dawn began filming in advance in June 1990, with overseas shoots in the Philippines and Harbin (despite the fact that Korea and China hadn't yet established diplomatic relations), a budget of (five- to ten-times the cost of an average drama at the time), over 270 actors and 21,000 extras. Starring Choi Jae-sung, Park Sang-won and Chae Shi-ra, the series depicted young Koreans caught in the maelstrom of turbulent history, from World War II, to the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. When it aired from 1991 to 1992, it reached a peak viewership rating of 58.4%. Sandglass 1991 was also the year SBS was launched, forming the three major Korean networks still existing in the present. The new station catalyzed fierce competition towards quantity and quality, and SBS began scouting writers and PDs from its rival stations. Kim had left MBC in 1992 and become a freelance producer, with his production shingle (which he co-founded with Song Ji-na) initially called Jcom. In 1995, he and Song moved to SBS to make Sandglass, which revolved around the tragic relationship between three friends affected by the political and civilian oppression of the 1970s and 80s. Sandglass was controversial because it doubled as a commentary on painful moments of Korea's contemporary history, such as the 1980 Gwangju Massacre (interspersed with its reenactment was archival video footage). It also became one of the most-watched dramas in the country's history, and the streets of Seoul were reportedly deserted whenever it aired. With average ratings of 50.8% and a peak rating at 64.5% (the third highest of all time), Sandglass made Choi Min-soo, Go Hyun-jung, Park Sang-won and Lee Jung-jae A-list stars, and Kim into one of the most influential figures in Korean television. Eyes of Dawn and Sandglass were the peak of the Kim-Song collaboration, and their succeeding dramas, both with each other and with other collaborators, would not reach the same heights of critical and commercial success. =1996 to 2002= From 1996 to 1997, Kim took a break from the small screen and produced four films, including Push! Push! starring Hwang Shin-hye and Bang Eun-jin. He returned to television in 1998, directing the action drama White Nights 3.98 which starred Choi Min-soo, Lee Byung-hun and Shim Eun-ha. Adapted by screenwriter Kang Eun-kyung from a novel by Han Tae-hoon, White Nights 3.98 was not as successful in the ratings as Kim's previous series. In 1999, Kim renamed his company Kim Jong-hak Production.http://www.kjhpro.com/ (As of 2018, the company is now a subsidiary of ESA Co., Ltd..)http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2018/08/29/0200000000AKR20180829033400008.HTML He collaborated with Song Ji-na for the sixth time in 2002's Great Ambition (대망, Daemang), a period drama starring Jang Hyuk, Lee Yo-won, Han Jae-suk and Son Ye-jin. =Fantasy epics= The Legend His next project with Song took five years of planning. The 2007 historical-fantasy-epic The Legend (also known as Taewangsasingi, or \\"The Four Guardian Gods of the King\\") was highly anticipated for being Korean Wave superstar Bae Yong-joon's first TV series in five years, and also starred Lee Ji-ah, Moon So-ri, Choi Min-soo, Park Sang- won and Lee Phillip. But despite excellent ratings (its peak was 35.7%) and solid overseas sales. Faith Kim's last drama was Faith (also known as The Great Doctor), his eighth and last collaboration with Song Ji-na. A fantasy epic about a 21st-century plastic surgeon who time travels to the Goryeo era and falls for royal bodyguard Choi Young, the series initially cast Lee Joon-gi and Kim Hee-sun as the protagonists. But Lee was drafted for mandatory military service, and he was replaced by Kang Ji-hwan, who then became embroiled in a legal dispute with his agency, and the role eventually went to Lee Min-ho. The casting changes stalled production for three years, and budget constraints forced Kim to modify his original plan to shoot in 3D. Given its budget and low ratings (around the 10% range), Faith was considered the biggest television flop of 2012. Kim, who hadn't recovered from the financial setbacks of The Legend, became mired in even greater debt. This resulted in him being ousted from Kim Jong-hak Productions, though the company retained his name under new leadership. Several months after the drama ended, members of the Faith cast and crew filed a lawsuit in February 2013 against Kim over unpaid wages amounting to (), under the charge that he had misappropriated for personal use. Furthermore, Kim was accused of double- contracting Faith's soundtrack rights to two separate companies. In May 2013, Kim was placed under investigation for fraud, embezzlement and professional negligence. In China at the time filming a Chinese television drama, Kim was summoned back home on account of the lawsuit, then issued an overseas travel ban. Devastated, he told his friends that his own life appeared to have become a soap opera. He continued to deny any allegations of wrongdoing. Death On July 23, 2013, the 61-year-old director was found dead in a small rented room in Bundang-gu, Gyeonggi Province. The cheap goshitel room (costing ) had been recommended to him by a longtime confidant, his barber, as a refuge before a questioning session at the prosecutor's office scheduled that day. In an apparent charcoal-burning suicide by asphyxiation, police officials said Kim had duct taped the doorways and windows, and half-burned charcoal briquettes were found near his body. There were no signs of forced entry, Kim's body didn't have any external injuries, and he left behind a four-page suicide note apologizing to his family and criticizing the prosecutors, one of them he identified with the surname \\"Kim\\". Kim Jong-hak said on his suicide note about his prosecution, =Reactions= The Korea Broadcasting Actors Union called Kim as both \\"a perpetrator and a victim of a flawed outsourced production system\\" in a statement, wherein it stated that “such tragedies will continue unless the outsourcing system that benefits only the broadcasters is eradicated.” Writer Song Ji-na, a long-time collaborator of Kim, revealed that Faith lead actress Kim Hee-sun was approached by staff and rookie actors of the series for help in filing the lawsuits against the drama's production company, and that she and the other cast felt guilty upon Kim Jong-hak's death. Legacy Despite his legal troubles late in life, Kim's legacy remains his work. Kim Seung-soo at the Seoul Institute of the Arts praised his eye for detail, saying, \\"He was a true master of his craft who insisted on perfection, and this passion had run into a brick wall.\\" Kim revolutionized Korean dramas and changed the visual paradigm of the industry, which heralded a Golden Age that would last nearly a decade. Both critically acclaimed and massively popular, Eyes of Dawn and Sandglass are currently considered iconic masterpieces of Korean television.

The work was exhibited in the spring of 1912 at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, and at the Salon de La Section d'Or, Galerie La Boétie, October 1912, Paris, (no. 117 of the catalogue, entitled Marine, collection Mme L. Ricou).Exhibit catalog for Salon de \\"La Section d'Or\\", 1912. Walter Pach papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Page 6 of the archive document. Page 11 of the original catalog, no. 117 Le Port was reproduced a few months later in the first major text on Cubism entitled Du \\"Cubisme\\", written in 1912 by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, published by Eugène Figuière Editeurs the same year. The Harbor was subsequently reproduced in The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations (Les Peintres cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques), written by Guillaume Apollinaire, published by Figuière in 1913 (collection Mme L. Ricou).Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, The Cubist Painters (Méditations esthétiques, Les Peintres Cubistes), translated, with commentary by Peter F. Read, 2002 At the Salon des Indépendants of 1912, Apollinaire had noticed the classical Ingresque qualities of Metzinger's Le Port, and suggested that it deserved to be hung in the Musée du Luxembourg's modern art collection. The dimensions and current whereabouts of Le Port are unknown. Description Le Port, probably an oil on canvas, depicts a complex harbor scene with sailboats, surrounding buildings and shuttered windows. On the distant horizon can be seen two larger boats; the one on the right perhaps a steam ship, the other with a large mast. Here Metzinger is almost exclusively concerned with principles of pictorial construction: the interplay of horizontals, diagonals, verticals and curves. The horizon is curved spherically. Rather than depicting The Harbor from one classical point of view, Metzinger has used a 'mobile perspective' to portray the subject from a variety of locations and from different angles at various moments in time. The images captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive time intervals are all shown simultaneously on one canvas.Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Cubist Works, 1910–1921, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press. p. 43.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, 1985, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) Metzinger and Gleizes wrote with reference to non-Euclidean geometry in Du \\"Cubisme\\", the manifesto in which The Harbor was selected, amongst other paintings, to represent the Cubist methodology. It was argued in the text that Cubism itself was not based on any geometrical theory but that non-Euclidean geometry corresponded better than classical Euclidean geometry to what the Cubsists were doing. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective. The topology chosen for The Harbor resembles that of a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold, as opposed to a standard Euclidean 3-space. This is a space of constant positive Gaussian curvature. The boats on the distant horizon are traveling a geodesic path of positive intrinsic curvature. All of the objects represented by Metzinger in this painting are embedded in the non-Euclidean Riemannian (or pseudo-Riemannian) manifold of constant positive Gaussian curvature. The surface depicted is neither locally or globally flat. But Metzinger goes further than the simple geometrical model of Gauss or Riemann by using the faceting of form associated with a robust form of analytic Cubism. In addition, each element or constituent of the painting partakes in the overall scheme of things subjectively, in each individual's mental realization (according to Roger Allard, 1910).Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) p. 15 Metzinger goes well beyond a non-Euclidean perspective with multiple points of view, beyond the technical innovations of analytical Cubism. He penetrates to its intellectual core: \\"an art capable of synthesizing a reality in the mind of the observer\\". (Daniel Robbins, 1985) The reconstruction of the total image was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role in the Cubist process. The sum of the parts of which the painting is composed now resides in the mind of the viewer. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist who chose the multiple view points, could be reassembled and understood in an interactive dynamic process.Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2001 :\\"But we cannot enjoy in isolation\\" wrote the two principle theorists of Du \\"Cubisme\\",Du \\"Cubisme\\", Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913) \\"we wish to dazzle others with that which we daily snatch from the world of sense, and in return we wish others to show us their trophies.\\" This reciprocity between the artist and the public is perhaps one of the reasons Metzinger felt the need to include elements of the real world into his paintings of the period, untouched by the wrath of total abstraction. \\"The reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; not yet, at all events\\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes in 1912. Art, to them, could not \\"be raised to the level of a pure effusion at the first step.\\" Salon des Indépendants, 1912 At the 1912 Salon des Indépendants Jean Metzinger exhibited Le Port (The Harbor) and La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse) — Albert Gleizes exhibited his monumental Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) (no. 1347) — Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001)Hommage à Marcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-catalogue, 1912-2012, Salon des Indépendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, Nu descendant l’escalier but was supposedly withdrawn — Roger de La Fresnaye exhibited Artillerie (no. 1235) — Robert Delaunay showed his immense Ville de Paris (no. 868) — Fernand Léger showed La Noce — Henri Le Fauconnier, Le Chasseur (The Huntsman) — and the newcomer Juan Gris exhibiting in a major Salon for the first time, showed his Portrait of Picasso.Salon des Indépendants, 1912, kubisme.infoBéatrice Joyeux-Prunel, Histoire & Mesure, no.

Roger Allard's reviewed the 1912 Salon des Indépendants in the March–April 1912 issue of La Revue de France et des Pays, noting Metzinger's 'refined choice of colors' and the 'precious rarity' of the painting's 'matière'. André Salmon too, in his review, noted Metzinger's 'refined use of color' in La Femme au Cheval and praised its 'French grace', while noting Metzinger 'illuminated a cubist figure with the virtues of a smile'.David Cottington, Cubism and Its Histories, Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 107 These early researches into Cubism were, in the words of Albert Gleizes, 'neither an alchemy nor a system.

He was well known for his special command in astronomy and mathematics. He championed for the progress of Muslims and laid foundation for Jamiya Sadiya (Deli, Kasaragod) and Malabar Islamic Complex (Chattanchal, Kasaragod). He wrote down many valuable oeuvres in astronomy and Islamic jurisprudence and established a time table for the prayer time ( Namaz time). He served as Qazi for about 100 Mahals (localities) and concentrated his work based on Mangalore. He was appointed as the Qazi of Mangalore province after the demise of late Qazi Kota Abdul Khader Musliyar. He championed for the communal harmony in Karnataka. Early life Born in 1933 into a famous scholarly family in the Chembarikka village of Kasargod, Qazi got his initial education from his father Muhammad Kunchi Musliyar bin Abdullah al-Jamhari, a verily respected scholar whose abode worked as a traditional court and a spiritual refuge for seekers. Muhammad Kunchi Musliyar taught various branches of Islamic knowledge at the native mosque for 25 years, and acted as the Qazi of several adjoining villages, called Mahallu. When he died in 1973, CM Abdullah Maulvi was unanimously asked to inherit his father. By that time he had earned sound knowledge, maturity and insights needed to keep the scholarly heritage of the family. Education While studying religious subjects from his father, Qazi continued schooling at the Talangara Muslim High School and completed the SSLC. Along with Arabic and local language of Malayalam, he learned Urdu and English languages and became well-versed in all the four languages. He frequently reminded the importance of learning various languages, saying it is a door to the wider world. After SSLC, he continued his education in the traditional mosque colleges (known as Palli Dars) at various places in Kerala. He completed the Maulvi Fadhil Baqawi course in 1962 from the famous Baqiyat al-Swalihat Arabic College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, a major centre of higher Islamic learning in South India established in 1882. Soon after completing his official religious education he started his teaching career and served as chief Mudarris at different mosque- colleges until he settled in Chembarikka following his father's death. Literary contribution An overview of Kerala Muslim history in the 20th century shows the emergence of various religious organizations with both traditionalist and modernist thoughts and philosophies, and their unparalleled activism in setting up religious, educational, social and cultural institutions. Most of the brilliant scholars and intellectuals spent their lifetime in unending social work and creative activities. It is said that due to increased social activism and enhanced focus on the teaching as well as propagation field, the Ulama of Kerala, especially in the 20th century, gave less attention to the field of writing and publication. Many of the brilliant and visionary scholars of the century left no works behind them, despite having possessed qualified knowledge in various branches of Islamic sciences. However, Qazi Abdulla Maulvi was a different personality. Though he played the active roles of an activist and multi-tasked leader by founding various educational and other institutions and dealing with the social and religious issues of thousands of people in hundreds of Muslim localities, he found time for writing and exploring new horizons of knowledge. He was a prolific writer who authored some ten noted books on various areas of knowledge in different languages. A great scholar of Islam, Qazi wrote books, treatises and articles on Hadees, Fiqh, history, genealogy, literature, and even showed his literary skill writing down a stunning poem in the locally developed but rich-in- resource Arabic-Malayalam language. He also proved his enormous linguistic ability by translating various literatures to and from Arabic, Urdu, English and Malayalam languages. His translation into poetic Arabic of some of Allama Iqbal's Urdu verses is worth mentioning. The language is stunning and the translation can be read with full sense of reading its original verses in Urdu. Expert in Astronomy, Mathematics and Qibla Sciences Qazi CM Abdullah Maulvi was an expert of rational or intellectual sciences. He showed amazing interest in exploring comparatively less beaten tracks of astronomy, mathematics and Qibla sciences. Having good knowledge of both classical Arabic and modern English he simultaneously studied traditional Arabic texts in these subjects and the modern English works in the field, making comparative analysis and successful reconciliation between the traditional and modern. He had the habit of observing the celestial objects and the movements of stars in the night. His ability to designate the exact places for mosques and houses was par excellence. He used to prepare timetables of Islamic prayers and of sunrise and sunset through his own explorations, and kept a good understanding of even minute time-differences in various places of Kerala and Karnataka. He even employed latest technologies like Google map and Google earth to designate places and explore its time differences. In the annually-published calendar of his institute Malabar Islamic Complex, he included many of his discoveries regarding prayer timings and moon sights, specifically mentioning certain dates of each month in which there are chances of moon-sighting and in which there is no need to even watch for it. His office in the Malabar Islamic Complex was in fact a laboratory of an astronomer. There, he kept various instruments used for astronomic explorations including one circular instrument called Dairatul Hindiyya, and he had built a small dais in front of the ground of the Islamic college building, in a place where the sunrays fall throughout the day. This dais or podium was the Centre of all his astronomical explorations. In the days meant for explorations he will reach in the college campus very early to start his experiments. As the sun moves from east to west he would watch its shadows and draw various lines accordingly, with the spirit of a true scientist seeking new discoveries. For many of his students and colleagues who showed less interest in such difficult subjects like astronomy, trigonometry and logarithm, the sight of a traditional religious scholar with long beard, white turban and conventional Ulama dress experimenting celestial truths in the sun using scale and other instruments was an amazing scene. During his reading and revising sessions at his room he can be seen dialoging with quality works from different areas of knowledge like modern astronomy, mathematics, traditional Ilmul Falak (astronomy) and Hisab (mathematics) as well as texts of Islamic jurisprudence that explain about moon-sighting, qibla directions and prayer timings. Qazi Abdullah Maulvi was in an attempt to revive a disappearing area of knowledge that has seen tremendous contributions by Muslim scholars, whose brilliant works were widely taught and commented upon at various Islamic higher learning centers. Generally being part of the rational sciences, called ma’qulat or al-‘ulum al-‘aqliyya, Hisab (mathematics) and ‘ilmul falak (astronomy) were included in the madrasa syllabus with an added objective of enabling scholars in preparing charts of prayer times, moon-sighting, seasonal changes, designating qibla direction of the mosques and related things. Mathematics and astronomy, along with subjects like logic, philosophy and Metaphysics, were also taught in the madrasas in order to enhance the thinking and reasoning capacity of the upcoming religious scholars. Khulasatu'l-Hisab, Euclid, Tashrihu'l-Aflak, Chaghmini, risalatul maradiniya, etc. were key texts used in teaching astronomy and mathematics. With the introduction of secular western education and the ensuing dichotomy of Islamic education into religious and material, the Islamic higher learning centers were effectively alienated from the modern science and technology. Though many of the traditional Islamic schools continued teaching the texts for hisab, astronomy and Qibla science, it never incorporated or accommodated to these subjects the latest discoveries and developments emerged in the west. While some rare brilliant minds kept their interest for these subjects burning, many other learned these for the sake of learning. Writing on science subjects Qazi C.M. Abdullah Maulvi was one among the rare breed of astronomy specialists among Kerala Muslim scholars. However, he outshined others in the group with his yearning to grasp all modern developments in the field. He bought latest journals and magazines published by authorities like NASA, thoughtfully read about latest discoveries and explorations, and enthusiastically discussed it with his students and colleagues. One of his junior colleagues remembers the smile and pleasure of a true scientist he saw in the face of Qazi when he explained for them the news about dismissal of Pluto from the planet family around the Sun, after reading a latest NASA journal about it. He wrote plenty of quality articles in various magazines and souvenirs about astronomy, qibla directions and about seasonal, regional and geographical differences in defining timings of prayers, moon-sighting, sunset and sunrise. He saw the general indifference towards this field among both religious and secular students, thanks to the tough and boring nature of the subjects to most of the people. But he continued his bids, now by writing a small treatise in Arabic on logarithms and trigonometry, aimed at giving an easy entry for religious students to modern mathematics with which they can easily comprehend the old texts in the light of modern terminologies. The book is called Tazweedul fikri wal himam fi tabyeeni nnisab wallogarithem (Provision for thought and resolve in explaining ratio and logarithm). Introducing this book, he said that it was written for an easy opening to the world of difficult and ambiguous mathematics. His introductory book on astronomy is ‘ilmul falak ‘ala dhaui ‘ilmil hadees (Astronomy on light of modern science). Incorporating the modern mathematics and astronomy into the traditional astronomy and qibla science he wrote his another work called Risala fi istikhraju auqati ssalati wa sumutul qibla ‘ala tariqi hisabi logarithm (Treatise on extracting prayer timings and qibla directions using logarithm mathematics).http://www.islamonweb.net/article/2012/05/199/qazi-cm- abdullah-moulavi-chembarikka/ Then come the works in English and Arabic describing the result of his lifelong experiments. The declination of the commonly used magnetic compass in designating the qibla direction always troubled his mind. The deficiency of the magnetic compass in clearly designating the exact north, thus its relative weakness in locating the exact qibla direction, induced him to make all his experiments. He developed a new method for exact calculation using logarithm and trigonometry. The above- mentioned treatise was a first step in this regard. Then to make his discovery known to more people he wrote a quality work in English named ‘Magnetic Compass and Its Declination from Standard Directions’. In its introduction he said, \\"Most of the people do not care to check the Magnetic Compass they use for making out various points of the basement of their structures for Homes or Mosques where accurate directions of cardinal points should be known. They do not consider the value of the magnetic variation of the place at all while using a magnetic Compass. This aspect was the inducement for the author for endeavor. I have tried, in very simple term in the following pages a brief history of magnetic Compass and clear description of declination of the magnetic needle from the true direction including the method by which to find out the standard direction (cardinal points). This book not only explains the direction and the declination but also guides you to achieve them from their sources.\\" He later translated this work into Arabic as ‘Al-Buswilatul Mu’antisiyya wa inhirafuha ‘anil jihatil aswliyya’. He has reportedly written some other works in this field, but decided not to publish them fearing that their contents would be tough for common people to understand. In his final days, he had mentioned to his well-wishers about the plan of a work on geography. He had the habit of observing stars in certain nights. However, it is painful that his lifelong dedication for exploring astronomy and unusual interest in synthesizing the contributions of medieval Muslim scholars and those of modern astronomy and mathematics went unnoticed until his death. As his fields of activities remained with the common people and his engagements as a religious scholar, teacher and qazi kept him busy always, the scientific achievements of this traditional Islamic scholar got no entry into academic seminars or journals. Reconciliation of traditional and modern in Islamic education Qazi C. M. Abdullah Maulvi is also remembered for his pioneering role in the post-independence bids among Kerala Muslims to reconcile traditional and modern knowledge in Islamic higher learning centers. Having proved through his own example that there is no contrast in embracing both simultaneously, he led movements for teaching the so-called material subjects in Islamic colleges. He emphasized the need to learn various languages including English, saying languages are doors to the abundant world of knowledge.

Also in 2010, CATW observed IDNP by opposing the decision in Bedford v. Canada to strike down Canada's anti-sex work laws. A group of former human trafficking victims and former sex workers in Canada also opposed the stricking down of these laws, picketing a courthouse in downtown Toronto, Ontario in recognition of IDNP.

Allgemeine Zeitung, May 2, 2008 Overview The cave contained some of the oldest pieces of mobile art ever discovered in southern Africa, associated with charcoal that was radiocarbon dated from 27,500 to 25,500 BP. The art slabs found in this cave are referred to as the Apollo 11 Stones. In total, seven grey-brown quartzite slabs were excavated from the cave. Besides the slabs, the cave contained several white and red paintings. The subject of paintings ranged from simple geometric patterns to bees, which are still a nuisance to the unwary traveler. Art was also found near the cave in the form of engravings on the banks of a riverbed and a large limestone boulder located from the cave. The engravings consisted of depictions of animals as well as simple geometric patterns. It is hard to pinpoint dates of the engravings and paintings, but the paintings may belong to period as far back as 10,400 BP and the engravings may come from early settlers in the first millennium AD. These dates come from Wendt's stratigraphic record of the site as well as evidence from other sites in the surrounding area. More recent finds include two rib pieces (one with 26 notches; the other with 12 notches) dated to 80,000 BP. See also * Caves of Namibia  References   Further reading  * John C.

Bail practices in the United States vary from state to state.  History of bail in the United States  =Colonial and early America= In pre-independence America, bail law was based on English law. Some of the colonies simply guaranteed their subjects the protections of that law. In 1776, after the Declaration of Independence, those states that had not already done so enacted their own versions of bail law.Dabney DA, Topalli V and Collins S (2005) From the hands-off era to today’s culture of control: The social construction of bail in the United States. Paper presented at the American Society of Criminology conference, Toronto, ON, November. For example, Section 9 of Virginia's 1776 Constitution originally stated, \\"excessive bail ought not to be required...\\" In 1785, Virginia added an additional protection to its constitution, \\"Those shall be let to bail who are apprehended for any crime not punishable in life or limb...But if a crime be punishable by life or limb, or if it be manslaughter and there be good cause to believe the party guilty thereof, he shall not be admitted to bail.\\" Section 29 of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 states that \\"Excessive bail shall not be exacted for bailable offences: And all fines shall be moderate.\\" The prohibition against excessive bail in the Eighth Amendment is derived from the Virginia Constitution. That prohibition applies in federal criminal prosecutions but, as the Supreme Court has not extended that protection to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment protection does not apply to defendants charged in state courts. In 1789, the same year that the United States Bill of Rights was introduced, Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789. That law specified which types of crimes were bailable and set bounds on a judge's discretion in setting bail. The Act provided that all non-capital crimes are bailable and that in capital cases the decision to detain a suspect prior to trial was to be left to the judge. =Bail Reform Act of 1966= In 1966, Congress enacted the Bail Reform Act of 1966, which expanded the bail rights of federal criminal defendants by giving non-capital defendants a statutory right to be released pending trial, on their personal recognizance or on personal bond, unless a judicial officer determined that such incentives would not adequately assure the defendant's appearance at trial. In the event that further assurance was deemed necessary, the judicial officer was required to select an alternative from a list of conditions, such as restrictions on travel. When setting bail, judicial officers were required to consider a defendant's family and community ties, employment history, and past record of court appearances. In non-capital cases, the Act did not permit a judge to consider a suspect's danger to the community, only in capital cases or after conviction is the judge authorized to do so. Individuals charged with a capital crime, or who had been convicted and were awaiting sentencing or appeal, were to be released unless the judicial officer had reason to believe that no conditions would reasonably assure that the person would not flee or pose a danger. The 1966 Act did not provide significant benefits to those defendants who were required to post bail, but lacked the financial means to raise and post bail. Due to the need to produce information about an arrested person in advance of bail hearing, the law also worked best for defendants who had access to lawyers who could help them compile that information in the short amount of time between arrest and hearing. District of Columbia The 1966 Act was particularly criticized within the District of Columbia, where all crimes formerly fell under federal bail law. In a number of cases, persons accused of violent crimes committed additional crimes when released on their personal recognizance. Even after being arrested on additional charges, some of those individuals were released yet again. D.C.'s Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety recommended that, even in non-capital cases, a person's dangerousness should be considered in determining conditions for release. The District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 allowed judges to consider dangerousness and risk of flight when setting bail in non- capital cases. = Bail bond programs = In the 1960s, some volunteer bail reform projects emerged, advocating new pretrial services programs. For example, the Manhattan Bail Project was formed by the Vera Institute of Justice in 1961, to advanced the theory that defendants with prominent ties to the community, such as a stable occupation or long marriage, could be confidently released on the strength of their promise to return.McElroy, Jerome E. “Introduction to the Manhattan Bail Project”. Federal Sentencing Reporter 24.1 (2011): 8-9. Academic Search Complete. Web. 31 Oct. 2017. This concept was later termed release on recognizance (ROR). The New York city government eventually assumed oversight of the program, although the Vera Institute of Justice design new ROR systems after defendants failed to appear. the Criminal Justice Agency (CJA) continues to provide ROR recommendations and oversee the status of released defendants. Another reform program was the VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) bail bond program, formed in Baltimore in 1968. The program defined a mathematical system to determine when a person charged with a crime was likely to voluntarily appear in court, such that the person might receive a personal recognizance bond.Kennedy, Padraic M. “VISTA Volunteers Bring About Successful Bail Reform Project in Baltimore”. American Bar Association Journal 54.11 (1968): 1093-1096. Academic Search Complete. Web. 31 Oct. 2017. The system was organized around a point-based marker, where defendants earned points for positive merit and were deducted points for poor behavior. A research program based in New York City tested the effects of a pretrial release agency and deposit bail. An analysis of the data accumulated over the course of the program indicated that the program was poorly executed by judges, and that bail reform initiatives were perceived by some judges as allowing preventive detention.Flemming, R. B., Kohfeld, C. W., & Uhlman, T. M. “The Limits of Bail Reform: A Quasi-Experimental Analysis”. Law & Society Review 14.4 (1980): 947-976. Academic Search Complete. Web. 31 Oct. 2017. In 2008, the New York Times wrote \\"posting bail for people accused of crimes in exchange for a fee, is all but unknown in the rest of the world\\".Adam Liptak Illegal Globally, Bail for Profit Remains in U.S., New York Times, 29 January 2008  Federal law  Congress repealed the Bail Reform Act of 1966 through its passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1984, codified at United States Code, Title 18, Sections 3141–3150. Unlike its predecessor, the 1984 Act law permits pre-trial detention of individuals based upon their danger to the community, not solely upon the risk of flight. (f) provides that only persons who fit into certain categories are subject to detention without bail: persons charged with a crime of violence, an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death, certain drug offenses for which the maximum offense is greater than 10 years, repeat felony offenders, or if the defendant poses a serious risk of flight, obstruction of justice, or witness tampering. There is a special hearing held to determine whether the defendant fits within these categories; anyone not within them must be admitted to bail. When persons charged with federal crimes are deemed to pose a risk to their communities, a judge must order pretrial detention.Wiseman, Samuel. \\"Discrimination, Coercion, and the Bail Reform Act of 1984: The Loss of the Core Constitutional Protections of the Excessive Bail Clause. Fordham Urban Law Journal 36.1 (2009): 121–157. Academic Search Complete. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. In a 1987 decision, United States v. Salerno, the Supreme Court upheld the 1984 Act's provision providing for pretrial detention based on community- danger. Under the Salerno ruling, pretrial detention without bail on the grounds of an arrestee's dangerousness is constitutional. Bail may also be denied if the funds used to post the bail likely came from an illegal source. If the source of the funds is illegal, it is deemed less likely that the posting of such funds as bail will ensure the defendant's appearance in court, and hence bail may be denied. The court may order a hearing called a Nebbia hearing to determine the source of the prospective bail funds before making a decision on bail. =Adam Walsh Amendments= In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Amendments (AWA) to the 1984 Act in response to a highly publicized case of sexual abuse and murder of a child. The amendments provide that any persons accused of a crime involving a minor must be confined, under curfew, and must report regularly to a law enforcement agency. Critics of the AWA argue that Congress should change the amendments so that a defendant has the opportunity to challenge release conditions that include tracking and monitoring.Handler, Michael R. \\"A Law of Passion, Not of Principle, Nor Even Purpose: A Call to Repeal or Revise the Adam Walsh Act Amendments to the Bail Reform Act of 1984.\\" The Journal of Law and Criminology 101.1 (2011): 279–308. JSTOR. Web. 15 Mar. 2016 They argue that the AWA violates defendants’ constitutional rights and undermine the objectives of the 1984 Act by stripping defendants of their rights without significant benefit to the public. Critics propose that defendants charged with offenses that trigger the AWA should be permitted to attempt to prove that its strict pretrial release conditions are unnecessary in their individual cases.Handler, Michael R. \\"A Law of Passion, Not of Principle, nor Even Purpose: A Call to Repeal or Revise the Adam Walsh Act Amendments to the Bail Reform Act of 1984.\\" Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology, vol. 101, № 1, Winter2011, pp. 279–308. =Impact= The impact of the law is subject to debate. One study on the Eastern Federal District of California found that average detention length and the overall detention rate has remained relatively unchanged before and after 1984, the group most affected by the law are repeated drug offenders, and the rates of pretrial crime and failure to appear on the trial date have stayed relatively low since the law's passing.Kingsnorth, Rodney, et al. \\"Preventive Detention: The Impact of the 1984 Bail Reform Act in the Eastern Federal District of California.\\" Criminal Justice Policy Review, vol. 2, № 2, June 1987, p. 150  State laws  Bail laws vary from state to state. Generally, a person charged with a non-capital crime can be expected to be granted bail. Some states have enacted statutes modeled on federal law that permit pretrial detention of persons charged with serious violent offenses, if it can be demonstrated that the defendant is a flight risk or a danger to the community.Mitchell, John N. “Bail Reform and the Constitutionality of Pretrial Detention”. Virginia Law Review 55.7 (1969): 1223-1242. Academic Search Complete. Web. 31 Oct. 2017. Since 2014, New Jersey and Alaska have enacted reforms that have abolished cash bail for the majority of cases. These states now give defendants a supervised release or mandatory detention, with the conditions determined with a risk assessment. , only four states, Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon and Wisconsin, had abolished commercial/for-profit bail bonds by bail bondsmen and required deposits to courts instead. Nebraska and Maine in addition to the aforementioned Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon and Wisconsin prohibited surety bail bonds. Some states have very strict guidelines for judges to follow; these are usually provided in the form of a published bail schedule.See, e.g., Bail Schedule , Los Angeles Superior Court. The L.A. Superior Court is the largest trial court system in the United States. These schedules list every single crime defined by state law and prescribe a presumptive dollar value of bail for each one. Judges who wish to depart from the schedule must state specific reasons on the record for doing so. Some states go so far as to require certain forfeitures, bail, and fines for certain crimes.State of Utah courts =California= California uses a bail schedule system, and judges in state court are directed to refer to the bail schedule while also taking into account the defendant's criminal record and whether the defendant poses a danger to the community. California plans to eliminate cash bail entirely. In August 2018, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill which sought replace all cash bail with pretrial detention based on court risk assessment beginning in October 2019.. The bill was opposed by both defenders of the current system and advocates for change, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch. In January 2019, that coalition gathered the required signatures to prevent the bill from going into effect and put the law to November 2020 voters as a California ballot proposition. = Texas = By state law, \\"the ability to make bail is to be regarded, and proof may be taken upon this point.\\" Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. § art. 17.15 Some courts in Texas, however, have determined bail in accord with a fixed schedule, without consideration of the defendant's ability to pay the scheduled amount. = Tennessee = In Tennessee, all offenses are bailable, but bail may be denied to those accused of capital crimes.Tenn. Const. Art. I, s 10.  Types of bail  In the United States there are several forms of bail used, which vary from jurisdiction. \\"The dominant forms of release are by surety bond, i.e. release on bail that is lent to the accused by a bond dealer, and non-financial release.\\"Eric Helland and Alexander Tabarrok. \\"The Fugitive: Evidence on Public versus Private Law Enforcement from Bail Jumping.\\" The Journal of Law and Economics 2004; 47(1), 93-122. DOI: 10.1086/378694 # Surety Bond: By a surety bond, a third party agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of the defendant. In many jurisdictions this service is provided commercially by a bail bondsman, where the agent will receive 10% of the bail amount up front and will keep that amount regardless of whether the defendant appears in court. The court in many jurisdictions, especially states that as of 2012 prohibited surety bail bondsmen – Oregon, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky and Maine – may demand a certain amount of the total bail (typically 10%) be given to the court, which is known as surety on the bond and unlike with bail bondsmen, is returned if the defendant does not violate the conditions of bail. The bail agent guarantees to the court that they will pay the forfeited bond if a defendant fails to appear for their scheduled court appearances, so the third party must have adequate assets to satisfy the face value of the bond. In turn, the Bond Agency charges a premium for this service and usually requires collateral from a guarantor. The bail agent then posts a bond for the amount of the bail, to guarantee the arrestee's return to court. # Recognizance (ROR): When an accused is released on recognizance, he or she promises to the court to attend all required judicial proceedings and will not engage in illegal activity or other prohibited conduct as set by the court. This is called release on one's own recognizance. # Unsecured bail. This is a release without a deposit but it differs from ROR in that the defendant must pay a fee upon breaching the terms of the bail. This is typically called an \\"unsecured appearance bond\\". # Percentage bail. The defendant deposits only a percentage of the bail's amount (usually 10%) with the court clerk. # Citation Release also known as Cite Out. This procedure involves the issuance of a citation by the arresting officer to the arrestee, informing the arrestee that he or she must appear at an appointed court date. Cite Outs usually occur immediately after an individual is arrested and no financial security is taken. # Property Bond – the accused or a person acting on his behalf pledges real property having a value at least equal to the amount of the bail. If the principal fails to appear for trial the state can levy or institute foreclosure proceedings against the property to recover the bail. Used in rare cases and in certain jurisdictions. Often, the equity of the property must be twice the amount of the bail set. # Immigration Bond – used when the defendant that been arrested is an illegal immigrant. This is a federal bond and not a state bond. The defendant deals directly with either the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Bureau of Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE). # Cash – typically \\"cash-only,\\" where the only form of bail that the Court will accept is cash. Court-ordered cash bonds require the total amount of bail to be posted in cash. The court holds this money until the case is concluded. Cash bonds are typically ordered by the Court for the following reasons: when the Court believes the defendant is a flight risk, when the Court issues a warrant for unpaid fines, and when a defendant has failed to appear for a prior hearing. Cash bonds provide a powerful incentive for defendants to appear for their hearings. If the defendant does not appear as instructed, the cash bond is forfeited and a bench warrant is issued. If the defendant shows up for their scheduled court appearances, the cash is returned to the person who posted the bond. Anyone including the defendant can post a cash bond. If the defendant posts his own bond, the Court will deduct fines and costs from the bond before returning any balance. # Pretrial Services – a defendant is released to the supervision of a pretrial services officer, similar to a probation officer. In most cases defendants have no financial obligation to be supervised. The Pretrial Services Programs can include phone or in-person check-ins, drug testing, court date reminders, and any other condition the judges deems necessary. # Combinations – courts often allow defendants to post cash bail or surety bond, and then impose further conditions, as mentioned below, to protect the community or ensure attendance. # Conditions of release – many varied non-monetary conditions and restrictions on liberty can be imposed by a court to ensure that a person released into the community will appear in court and not commit any more crimes. Common examples include: mandatory calls to the police, regular check-ins with a Pretrial Services Program, surrendering passports, home detention, electronic monitoring, drug testing, alcohol counseling, surrendering firearms.Vance, Neil R., and Ronald J. Stupak. “Organizational Culture and the Placement of Pretrial Agencies in the Criminal Justice System.” The Justice System Journal, vol. 19, no. 1, 1997, pp. 51–76. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27976928. # Protective order, also called an 'order of protection' or restraining order – one very common feature of any conditional release, whether on bail, bond or condition, is a court order requiring the defendant to refrain from criminal activity against the alleged crime victim, or stay away from and have no contact with the alleged crime victim. The former is a limited order, the latter a full order. Violation of the order can subject the defendant to automatic forfeiture of bail and further fine or imprisonment.  Criticisms of bail  Criticism of the practice of giving bail in the United States tends to be directed at the system of cash bail. One of the most common complaints is that a defendant's chance of being released pre-trial is determined by how wealthy they are, rather than how much of a risk they are to the public or judicial process. A further argument is that it results in unnecessary pre-trial detentions, when many defendants can be trusted to appear in court without incarceration or with less drastic monitoring. The unnecessary incarceration also puts defendants at risk of being wrongly convicted or drawn further into crime. The system has been further accused of being inconsistent, affected by racial bias and having undesirable effects on wider communities. =Wealth bias= US Senator Kamala Harris talks about wealth bias and bail reform in 2017. A common criticism of the system of cash bail is that it creates a system where wealthier defendants are less likely to be incarcerated pre-trial than poorer defendants, even if they are accused of the same crime and pose the same risk to the community and judicial process.ZWEIG, JONATHAN. \\"Extraordinary Conditions Of Release Under The Bail Reform Act.\\" Harvard Journal On Legislation 47.2 (2010): 555-585. Academic Search Complete. Web. 15 Mar. 2016.\\"Preventive Detention before Trial.\\" Harvard Law Review 1966: 1489. JSTOR Journals. Web. 17 Mar. 2016. In the high-profile cases of Bernie Madoff and Marc Dreier, the defendants avoided pre-trial detention despite huge flight risks, simply because they had the money to pay the court exorbitant sums. This is in accordance to the current interpretation of the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which allows the wealthy to avoid pretrial detainment by paying for highly restrictive measures that ensure constant supervision. This means that a poor defendant being held in jail while waiting for a trial, while a wealthy defendant would only face house arrest while waiting trial for the same offense. Bail reformists claim that this is a direct violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which states that laws must be applied against all citizens equally.Zweig, Jonathan. \\"Extraordinary Conditions of Release Under the Bail Reform Act.\\" Harvard Journal on Legislation 47.2 (2010): 555-585. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Mar. 2016 =Unnecessary incarceration= Reform campaigners argue that the cash bail system results in unnecessary detentions, and propose reforms that will reduce the jail population.Formby, William A. and Sigler, Robert T. \\"The Necessity of Bail Reform.\\" Criminal Justice Review (Georgia State University), vol. 3, no. 1, Spring1978, p. 1. Many advocates for placing harsher restrictions on bail enforcement and decreasing the amount of detainees out on pretrial release point to the argument that allowing bail greatly increases the risk of allowing arrestees out on bail to skip their trial (known as flight risk). However, a study conducted by Gerald R. Wheeler and Carol L. Wheeler published by the Review of Policy Research finds that this is hardly the case. The article focuses on bail reform in the United States and specifically targets the relationship between being released on bail and the flight risk of arrestees not showing up to their trial. Since many opponents of bail reform during the time believed that allowing bail would result in a decrease of arrestees showing up for their trial dates, this article tests that belief by analyzing randomly selected felony cases in Houston, Texas. The paper concluded that the flight risk of arrestees out on bail was extremely minimal, as only 2% of all defendants on pretrial leave avoided their trial date. The study also concluded that the effect of pretrial status, whether a criminal was detained or not before their trial, did not have an effect on the ultimate conviction.Wheeler, Gerald R. and Carol L. Wheeler. \\"Two Faces of Bail Reform: An Analysis of the Impact of Pretrial Status on Disposition, Pretrial Flight and Crime in Houston.\\" Review of Policy Research, vol. 1, no. 1, Aug. 1981, pp. 168-182. Socio-economic effects Whether a result of pre-trial detention or not, incarceration has adverse effects resulting in many defendants' inability to maintain employment, access mental and physical healthcare, and engage in constant communication with their family and friends. Pretrial release conditions placed on youth are largely ineffective, often causing them to commit further crimes by violating the conditions. This means that bail conditions ultimately create a cycle of criminality, trapping juveniles into the prison system rather than helping them escape it.Sprott, Jane B., and Jessica Sutherland. \\"Unintended Consequences of Multiple Bail Conditions For Youth.\\" Canadian Journal of Criminology & Criminal Justice 57.1 (2015): 59-82. This effect on the youth community is a large reason why activists lobby for bail reform, seeking to prevent the next generation from being trapped in the school-to-prison-pipeline. The VISTA bail bond program in Baltimore in the 1960s, which dealt with 16-20 year old defendants, suggested that while youth are more susceptible to negative consequences of pretrial release conditions, they are also more receptive to positive bail reform programs. There exist socio-economic arguments against bail reform as well. For example, one cost-benefit analysis of bail pricing using data from the 1981 Philadelphia Bail Experiment estimated optimal bail prices to be similar to higher levels before the Bail Reform Acts of 1966 and 1984.Abrams, David S., and Chris Rohlfs. \\"Optimal Bail and the Value of Freedom: Evidence from the Philadelphia Bail Experiment.\\" Economic Inquiry 49.3 (2010): 750-770. The Encyclopedia of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Web. 17 Mar. 2016.  Attorney access  An attorney's ability to defend their client is greatly hampered when their client is placed in pretrial detainment. Jailed defendants are difficult to work with due to restricted access and visiting hours, and have minimal time with their attorneys when compared to those who are granted pretrial release. This lack of coordination between the attorney and defendant makes it impossible to craft a strong defense, given that the defendant will often lack witness coaching. Defense attorneys that specialize in criminal trial have gone as far as to say that pretrial detention limits a defendant's ability to exercise his or her constitutional rights.Kalhous, Clara, and John Meringolo. \\"Bail Pending Trial: Changing Interpretations of the Bail Reform Act and the Importance of Bail from Defense Attorney's Perspectives.\\" Pace Law Review 32.3 (2012): 800 -855. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Mar. 2016.  Juror bias  In 2014, a study done over 975 New Jersey cases tracked a defendant's ability to set bail and the final outcome of their trial, and concluded that pretrial detention adversely impacts the length of sentencing in cases of conviction. That is to say, within the same offense type, those unable to post bail received longer sentences than those able to. There have also been other studies that indicate that pretrial detainment sets the odds against the defendant, reducing their chance of acquittal. Attorneys attest that jurors are almost always aware of defendants' bail status, which creates an implicit bias against their client. Criticism of the bail bond industry Bail Bondsman located outside of the New York City Criminal Court in Manhattan, NYC Even if it is eventually refunded, producing the bail money is a huge expense to the defendant and their family.Handler, Michael R. \\"A Law Of Passion, Not Of Principle, Nor Even Purpose: A Call To Repeal Or Revise The Adam Walsh Act Amendments To The Bail Reform Act Of 1984.\\" Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology 101.1 (2011): 279-308. Academic Search Complete. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. The United States is one of the few countries in the world that permit defendants to use a bail bondsman. In return for a non-refundable payment, the bail bondsman will pay the bail amount and receive it when the trial is over. Bail bonds are a profitable industry, making $20 million a year in profit according to a 2012 study.Maruna, Shadd, Dean Dabney, and Volkan Topalli. \\"Putting A Price On Prisoner Release: The History Of Bail And A Possible Future Of Parole.\\" Punishment & Society 14.3 (2012): 315.Publisher Provided Full Text Searching File. Web. 17 Mar. 2016. Bail reform campaigners have criticized the bail bond industry for profiting off poor defendants and for creating perverse incentives by involving a for-profit industry in the judicial process, which is related to wider criticism of the prison-industrial complex.Maruna, Shadd, Dean Dabney, and Volkan Topalli. \\"Putting a Price on Prisoner Release: The History of Bail and a Possible Future of Parole.\\" Punishment and Society 14.3 (2012): 315-317. Sage Journals. Web. 16 Mar. 2016. =Inconsistency= The bail system is further criticized for being arbitrary in how it is applied.WALIA, MANI S. \\"Putting the \\"Mandatory\\" Back in the Mandatory Detention Act.\\" St. John's Law Review, vol. 85, no. 1, Winter2011, pp. 177-229. Legally, bail determination is based on four factors: seriousness of the crime, ties to the community, the flight risk posed by the defendant, and the danger posed by the defendant to his or her community. California Penal Code section 1269b provides an example of the factors courts are directed to consider. In reality, bail determination may also take into account extraneous factors. Some studies have found judicial bias, where a defendant's race, class, or gender affect bail.Sacks, Meghan, and Alissa R. Ackerman. \\"Bail and Sentencing: Does Pretrial Detention Lead to Harsher Punishment?\\" Criminal Justice Policy Review 25.1 (2014): 59-77. A 1984 study found that when judges were given specific policy guidelines, people with similar convictions were given similar bail amounts. There is concern that great variability across judges yields variability in decisions for identical candidates. The reason for such disparity is that different judges may assign different weights to factors such as flight risk or community ties.Dhami, Mandeep K. \\"From Discretion to Disagreement: Explaining Disparities in Judges' Pretrial Decisions.\\" Behavioral Sciences & the Law 23.3 (2005): 367-386. The Encyclopedia of Criminology and Criminal Justice. This is an oft cited reason as to why bail reform is necessary, as ambiguity in the bail decision making process may lead to unfair and disparate outcomes. Even for bail determination based on the danger posed by the defendant to his or her community, critics note that the government's definition of “dangerous” defendants who may not be allowed to go on bail have a tendency not to be dangerous or avoid their hearings at all, suggesting that the definition is too wide and needs to be reformed. There is reason to believe that a correlation exists between class status and bail decisions. Recent analysis of data taken from Florida bail hearings revealed that indigent defendants with public defenders were more likely to be denied bail when compared to those with retained (hired) counsel, but that when they were awarded bail, it was set lower. Several suggested explanations for this result include higher skill level of retained counsel and prison overcrowding.Williams, Marian R. \\"The Effect of Attorney Type on Bail Decisions.\\" Criminal Justice Policy Review (2014): 1-15. Sage Journals. Web. 17 Mar. 2016 Many prison systems face overcrowding in the modern area of mass incarceration, and setting unusually low bails appear to be the judge's way of relieving pressure for local prisons. =Effect on trials= Moreover, a court's decision to grant or deny bail has a direct impact on the outcome of a criminal case. Incarcerated defendants are significantly less able to help in his/her defense for freedom in comparison to someone on bail who is unrestricted or perhaps conditionally restricted to home confinement. They are also unable to arrange meetings with suspected witnesses, and/or provide their attorney with important information about the case, thus creating logistical barriers. Furthermore, the paper finds that because more defendants are now less likely to be allowed a pretrial release, the prosecution's bargaining position is enhanced in plea negotiations, where incarcerated defendants are promised time off in exchange for their cooperation or plea of guilty. People that are denied bail are more likely to plead guilty in thoughts that they will lose at trial. Those denied bail are often sentenced to longer amounts of time than those who are granted pretrial release.Kalhous, Clara, and John Meringolo. \\"Bail Pending Trial: Changing Interpretations Of The Bail Reform Act And The Importance Of Bail From Defense Attorneys' Perspectives.\\" Pace Law Review 32.3 (2012): 800-855. Academic Search Complete. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. =Racial bias= Moreover, bail policies and bail decisions have been demonstrated to be applied disproportionately harmfully against black and Latino defendants, particularly males.Shalom, Alexander. \\"Bail Reform as a Mass Incarceration Reduction Technique.\\" Rutgers Law Review 4(2014): 921https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/us/bail-california-bill/index.html This can be attributed to internalized racial prejudices among judges and bail officers, and also to how current bail policies fail to protect them from such discrimination. When combined with the bail system's favor towards the wealthy, it is found that people of color of low socioeconomic backgrounds suffer most in the justice system, a further violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Test data from the bail bond market in New Haven, Connecticut, also shows the existence of discrimination based on race when bail is set for minority defendants. Specifically, black and Hispanic defendants generally received disproportionately high bail charges. In order to fight against racial discrimination, some suggest a “color-blind” bail solution that sets bail based on the average offender, regardless of race or gender. =Constitutionality= Samuel Wiseman, a J.D from Yale Law School and a critic of the Bail Reform Act of 1984, argues in a paper published by the Fordham Urban Law Journal that the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment protects criminal defendants from governmental discrimination and coercion and that the Bail Reform Act of 1984 removes these protections. Wiseman continues by stating that the Bail Reform Act of 1984 is unconstitutional because it allows judicial officer to consider certain individual characteristics of a defendant which the Eighth Amendment asks not to consider. Wiseman concludes his article with a statistical analysis of arrestees out on bail before and during the passing of the Bail Reform Act of 1984. He finds that since the passing of the Bail Reform Act, the number of pretrial detentions has risen nearly 40%.Wiseman, Samuel. \\"DISCRIMINATION, COERCION, and the BAIL REFORM ACT of 1984: The LOSS of the CORE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS of the EXCESSIVE BAIL CLAUSE. (Cover Story).\\" Fordham Urban Law Journal, vol. 36, no. 1, Jan. 2009, pp. 121-157. Reform Bail reform generally refers to reform that aims to reduce or entirely eliminate the use of cash bail.Shalom, Alexander. \\"Bail Reform As A Mass Incarceration Reduction Technique.\\" Rutgers Law Review 4 (2014): 921. InfoTrac LegalTrac. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. Some scholars have questioned why certain states do not implement certain bail reforms, but chose to enforce others. Kyle Rohrer of the University of Oregon School of Law answers this question in his paper published in the Oregon Law Review. He finds that bail reform is difficult to put into place because many judicial officers do not want to take the risk of releasing an arrestee pretrial because the defendant may never show up for his trial or, even worse, commit an additional crime while on pretrial leave. If this were to happen, the public would blame the judiciary officer, thus making judiciary officers reluctant to spearhead bail reform. Rohrer argues, however, that the need to create vacancy in overcrowded prisons outweighs the flight risks of arrestees out on bail. He therefore argues that states should employ bail reform to create a more efficient prison system.Rohrer, Kyle \\"Why Has the Bail Reform Act Not Been Adopted by the State Systems?.\\" Oregon Law Review, vol. 95, no. 2, Apr. 2017, pp. 517-541. The alternatives to cash bail include: *Release without bail: Sometimes known as \\"release on recognizance\\" (ROR). The defendant is released with a pledge to appear in court and to not interfere with the judicial process. The only incentive they have to appear in court is the fact that failing to appear would be a criminal offense. *Pretrial supervision: The defendant is released but subject to restrictions (such as electronic monitoring or house arrest). *Compulsory detention: When cash bail has been abolished, it has led to more (but not most) defendants being detained without an offer of release through posting bail (if they could afford it). This is reserved for serious crimes, which would normally result in bail being too high for the defendant to pay unless they were wealthy. =Abolition of cash bail= As of January 2020, three states have abolished cash bail for the majority of court cases. In 2014, New Jersey enacted reforms that took effect on January 1, 2017. All criminal defendants are now assessed with a point-based system to determine whether they should be released from custody, held in jail until trial, or subjected to alternative procedures (including house arrest, electronic monitoring, and, in limited cases, cash bail) to ensure public safety and the defendant's appearance in court. Alaska adopted a similar reform in 2016, which took effect in 2018. New York adopted a similar reform in early 2020, but this was largely rolled back in April of that year. =Other proposals= Some reform proposals focus on not abolishing cash bail but reforming it. These include giving guidelines to judges or mandatory instructions to make sure cash bail is set in a more consistent way. The second solution, however, presents a problem in that it reduces the justice system's flexibility, and loses humanity. Many reformists prefer a more individualized bail procedure, citing the importance of considering circumstances and how no set of guidelines can adequately and fairly address every possible scenario. Fixing outcome disparity while retaining judicial flexibility remains a paradox that bail reformists have yet to solve, and is a point where many activists diverge. Another solution is to pass federal laws. This would mean amending the Bail Reform Act of 1984 to explicitly require courts to take into account a defendant's economic status. In states where no reform has yet been acted, some organizations provide not-for-profit bail bonds to allow poor defendants to be released pre-trial. Those who support decarceration in the United States want to abolish pretrial detention and restrictions entirely. This proposal is closely tied to the prison abolition movement.

It is situated about north of Broken Hill and north east of Mannahill in the outback of New South Wales. Currently occupying an area of the property is still operating as a sheep station but also as a farmstay for tourists. The area is arid and most water is pumped from bores, though Stephens Creek runs through the property and has semi-permanent water-holes. The property is composed of gibber plains, large areas of saltbush and mulga and sandy creek beds surrounded by coolibah trees. The old station homestead is now the site of the Broken Hill Royal Flying Doctor Service. The station was established around 1863 by the Barrier Ranges Company which included George Urquhart who owned neighbouring Kinchega Station. The property takes its name from Mount Gibbs that was named by Charles Sturt during his expedition of 1844. Mount Gipps was the first established station in the Barrier Range area and one of the first west of the Darling River. The run was taken up in 1866 by McCredie and Cunningham who occupied an area of including an outstation at Stephens Creek; the pair later sold it to James McCulloch and Robert Sellar. James McCulloch's cousin, George McCulloch, later became manager and was given a 2/16 share in the Mount Gipps Pastoral and Mineral Company; amongst his employees was a young Sidney Kidman who was employed at Mount Gipps as a roustabout and bullock driver. By 1877 the property encompassed about and supported a flock of 71,000 sheep. In 1883 a boundary rider from Mount Gipps named Charles Rasp who, along with six fellow workers, formed the Syndicate of Seven pegged out the mining claim for the one of the world's richest lodes of silver, lead and zinc at Broken Hill in the Barrier Range forming the company Broken Hill Proprietary Limited.

Rising in the York Mountains, the river empties into the Bering Sea, west of Port Clarence. It is located east of Cape York. Geography Lost River has a length of about , and drains the central part of the York Mountains. Its two tributaries, Tin Creek and Cassiterite Creek, enter from the east about and , respectively, from its mouth, and tin ore has been found on both of these creeks. Cassiterite Creek, which is really the larger fork of Lost River, has a length of about . Tin Creek, about long, heads within about of Cassiterite Creek, and, flowing parallel with it for about the same distance, turns westward and enters Lost River through a canyon cut in the limestones of the York Mountains. Lost River itself flows in a comparatively broad valley cut in these limestones. The bed of the river is not deeply gravel filled, and the valley floor is practically cut out of the limestones and not to any extent built on them. The mouth of Cassiterite Creek is about above the sea. Between Tin Creek aad Lost River, there is a stock of granite intruded into the limestone, which outcrops in a nearly circular area, probably in diameter. History In 1898, a party of disappointed prospectors, returning from Kotzebue Sound, were shipwrecked a few miles east of the mouth of Lost River, and were obliged to camp at that point during the winter. A cabin built largely from wreckage of their schooner is known as the Kotzebue cabin. These prospectors probably first applied the name Lost River to this stream. In the succeeding summer a mining district was organized by survivors of this expedition, with headquarters located on King River, which enters Bering Sea between Lost River and Cape York. The Lost River region was included at that time in the King River recording district. No discoveries of gold were made, however, and the region was abandoned by prospectors. In the winter of 1902, prospectors again turned their attention to this region in the search for tin ore. Granite porphyry dikes, which occur in the limestones near the mouth of Lost River and also near King River, first attracted their attention, and many specimens of this were mistaken for \\"tin crystals,\\" were sent to various assayers, from whom widely divergent reports were obtained. Early in the summer of 1903, Charles Randt, Leslie Crim, and Y. J. O'Brien discovered minerals in Tin Creek and made a thorough search for tin ore in that vicinity. They made a large collection of minerals, which was sent to Teller in July, 1903. Metallic tin was readily obtained from one small specimen by aid of a blowpipe, while the larger part of the collection was shown to contain minerals of no value. The collection was of sufficient interest to tempt an examination of the locality in detail where there was evidence of tin ore which had been seen in Teller to the granitic dike on Cassiterite Creek, and also to obtain specimens of stannite ore from Tin Creek. Since this examination the dike described has been called \\"Cassiterite ledge\\" in location notices, and it has been definitely traced through a group of four claims. A crosscut trench has been made near the Cassiterite Creek end of the ledge, which, it is reported, shows that the ledge has a width of 100 feet and that cassiterite is disseminated throughout the rock.

It differs from bed-rest, a form of non-invasive treatment that is usually part of recovery or the limitation of activities. Some of the more serious consequences of being bedridden is the high risk of developing thrombosis and muscle wasting (atrophy). Its meaning is derived from a middle English term (bedrid) from a 1300s past tense form of riding a bed.  Bed rest  This is a voluntary medical treatment still used today to help cure illness. Current views regarding this treatment are that there are no benefits for most conditions studied. Though bedrest may still be prescribed for pregnant women, it is now considered dangerous.Bed Rest During PregnancyIs It 'Unethical’ To Prescribe Bed Rest For Pregnant Women?  CommonHealth Those who are bedridden can develop complications related to feeding.  Complications  Being bedridden leads to many complications such as loss of muscle strength and endurance. Contractures, osteoporosis from disuse and the degeneration of joints can occur. Being confined to bed can add to the likelihood of developing an increased heart rate, decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and thromboembolism. People with disabilities who are bedridden are at risk for developing pressure sores. Those who are bedridden are at risk in a house fire due to their lack of mobility. Showering can become impossible. Bedsores develop if a person spends most or all of the day in bed without changing position Being confined to bed may result in a person remaining passive and withdrawn. The ability to transfer to a chair and the negative attitudes of caregivers is associated with continued confinement to bed and reduction of such requests. Those who are confined to bed have risks related to falls. Falling from a bed can result in injury.  Prevention  One recommendation for preventing the complications of being bedridden is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet that contains enough calories and protein needed for optimum health. If someone is confined to a bed, changing position at least every two hours can help prevent complications in addition to change sheeting and bedclothes immediately if they are soiled, and using items that can help reduce pressure, such as pillows or foam padding.  Studies  One Indian study of care given to bedridden individuals at home found that family members made up 82% of caregivers. A high rate of medical complications was reported, including pressure ulcers and urinary tract infections.

He is the Commissioner of the Big Ten Conference. The first Commissioner who is African-American, he is also the first in any of the major American student-sports conferences in history. Warren was previously the Chief Operating Officer of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, and was the highest-ranking African-American executive working on the business side for an NFL team.

In 2013 Arizona State University (ASU) named Dr. Warren as one of the Top 50 ASU football players of all time. His eldest brother, Morrison Warren, Jr., played football at Stanford in the early 1960s, and was one of the first African-American scholarship student-athletes at Stanford. As a young boy, Kevin was struck by a car and forced into traction and a body cast for many months. Doctors informed Warren that there was a chance he might not walk again, and therefore it was highly unlikely that he would ever fulfill any dreams he had of playing sports. A doctor told Kevin that aquatic rehabilitation exercises may be his only hope at recovery. Since there was not an easily accessible pool in Kevin's neighborhood, Kevin used the money from the insurance settlement he received following the car accident to construct a pool in his backyard.

Created in 1987, ABC Nepal was one of the first Non Governmental Organisations established in Nepal. It was established before the multiparty democracy in Nepal in 1991 and officially registered then after. ABC Nepal is led by president Durga Ghimire. History ABC Nepal was the first Nepalese organisation to raise the issue of human trafficking on a national level, and did so by organizing conferences about the trafficking of underage girls and sex slavery in Nepal in 1991. It is one of the leading organisations working in this field. The combined effort of ABC Nepal along with other organisations has led to the creation and implementation of various laws regarding women rights and human trafficking. ABC Nepal played a part in the rescue of 35 girls from the Apollo circus in New Delhi in 1996. They have also helped to rescue girls from brothels in India working as a sex slaves and later to rehabilitate them back into society. They work to prevent trafficking in women and children by generating social awareness especially among rural people and conducting border monitoring and cross border programs. Focus area of work Girls from Nepal constitute the majority of commercial sex workers in India. Most of them are minors and most are infected with HIV (AIDS). They live in horrible conditions, such as red light zones where they are abused physically and sexually, bonded by the owner for years, tortured and imprisoned. On the other hands poor families living in rural parts of Nepal get easily attracted to the city, which offers good jobs and a better overall life. The illiterate girls are made to sell their body to re-earn the amount including the interest for which they were bought by the brothel and hence entrapped as bonded labour for years. Escape is virtually impossible under the direct surveillance, threat, and terror of owners. Corruption is prevalent in both the police and governments of India and Nepal, making both the trafficking easy and escape near impossible. The virgins, once worshiped as Goddess Kumari, return home back with HIV and the stigma attached to it. This makes them unacceptable to society, making reintegration and repatriation difficult and sometimes impossible. Besides sexual exploitation, girls have also been trafficked for various other reasons, including to have their kidneys sold, to be forced into marriage, or to work as domestic workers and cheap labourers in various parts of India. With the changing public perspective of migration, raising level of awareness among women, and the shift of trafficking pattern in Nepal, ABC Nepal has now been focusing on trafficking of girls beyond India, especially in Saudi Arabia. Lots of Nepali youth are moving to Arabian countries, Malaysia, or elsewhere for newer and better employment opportunities, especially as housekeepers and factory workers. Many girls lured by dream of better world and job follow the path led by unauthorized dealers and traffickers and end up being sexually exploited and enslaved. Programs and activities ABC Nepal has provided income- generating training to rural women and victims of trafficking to help them alleviate their poverty and improve their living standard. They have formed more than 300 women cooperative groups. ABC Nepal has also promoted self- reliance, self-confidence and leadership skill in women by economic empowerment, vocational training, and non formal education. The nonprofit focuses on reproductive health providing education to secondary school children's and operating health clinics and safe abortion campaigns. They have placed a special focus on HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness. The group enhances leadership in women and increases the participation of affected women at the local, regional, and national level. They also provide legal protection and can represent the victims in legal processes. ABC Nepal operates rehabilitation homes in Kathmandu, Bhairahawa, and Biratnagar to provide shelter to the victims of trafficking and violence against women. ABC Nepal is raising awareness for safe migration. For example, the group monitored the Tribhuwan International Airport, establishing help desk in major border transit of Bhairahawa.

Goa Today is considered the \\"grand-daddy\\" of all monthly magazines in Goa. It was founded by Francisco Damasceno do Rosario Dantas and former joint- editor of Navhind Times, Lambert Mascarenhas, who was awarded the Gomant Vibhushan Award, the highest civilian award of Goa in 2014. The main problem facing the magazine in the 2010s is fostering enough advertising to meet publication costs. It was founded by Lambert Mascarenhas, now a centurion and F. D. Dantas. During Mascarenhas' and Dantas' ownership, Norman Dantas was first Associate editor and then as Executive editor for the magazine. When Goa Today was sold to Salgaocar Mining Industries, Mascarenhas was followed as editor by Vaman Sardesai, who left in 1987 to become India's ambassador to Angola. He was followed as editor by the poet-journalist Manohar Shetty, who maintained the high standards and promoted Goan literature while keeping the balance between history, political issues and literature. Vinayak Naik is the current editor. In the mid 1980s, Goa Today was purchased by the Salgaocar Mining Industries, now part of the V. M. Salgaocar group of companies, which also own the Salgaocar Football Club of Goa.

Bone, The guitar and mandolin, Biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, Schott and Company, London, 1914 Hauska was a son of the schoolmaster of Mies, and when eight years of age moved with his parents to Prague, where his father had been appointed to a school. Hauschka studied music in this city, and took up the mandolin as his first instrument. He also entered the cathedral as a chorister and later received systematic instruction from Josef Seeger and Ferdinand Laube, \\"the father of the violin virtuoso.\\" Hauschka devoted himself to the cello and mandolin and made remarkable progress on both, and a few years afterwards continued the cello studies under Christ, one of the most celebrated Bohemian virtuosi. At sixteen years of age he entered the orchestra of the Count of Thun and remained in his service till the death of the Count two years later, when the orchestra was disbanded. He then made a concert tour through Austria and Germany, visiting Karlsbad, Dresden and other important cities, where his performances on both instruments were highly spoken of. Towards the end of 1792 he took up his residence in Vienna, where his public performances attracted considerable notice. After he had resided in Vienna for several years, he gave up on music as a profession and accepted a position in the government. After this appointment his public appearances were rare, but he still took an active interest in the art. He was one of the founders of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Vienna, and also the Concert Spirituel. He continued to write for his instruments; but the majority of his compositions were not published, the principal manuscripts being nocturnes and quintets for mandolin, alto and violoncello, as well as concertos for cello, and church compositions.

Duncan grew up in Washington state and now lives with his wife and children in France, where he is researching and writing a book. A self-described “complete history geek” grew from an interest in ancient civilizations as a child, with a particular affinity for Roman history. After not finding any Roman history podcasts in 2007, Duncan began The History of Rome. The podcast concluded in 2012. A year later he began Revolutions. Each season of the podcast focuses on one revolution. In 2017, Duncan wrote The Storm Before the Storm, which was well reviewed and appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list. Personal life Duncan was born in Redmond, Washington, and attended Western Washington University, attaining a degree in Political Science with a minor in Philosophy. He is an avid fan of the Seattle Mariners baseball team. Aside from podcasting and writing, Duncan is currently a stay-at-home dad. Earlier in his career, he worked as a fishmonger; he was in the fish trade most of the time he was recording The History of Rome. Duncan also occasionally creates political comic strips in collaboration with illustrator Jason Novak. In 2018 Duncan relocated to Paris, France in order to do research for an upcoming book on the Marquis de Lafayette. During the course of The History of Rome, Duncan married and made a special The History of Rome episode on Roman wedding customs in celebration. Duncan and his wife have a son, daughter, and two pets. Interest in history Duncan’s interest in Roman history grew from a “general interest in ancient civilizations”. As a child, he would often flip through his parents’ encyclopedia set to the entries on Ancient Egypt or Ancient Greece, the Maya, the Inca, etc. The largest and most encompassing of those civilizations to Duncan was always the Romans. Mike became especially interested in Roman history while reading his grandfather's paperback version of Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Describing himself as “a complete history geek”, Duncan also has a huge interest in American history. He believes the greatest difference between America and Rome is that compared to Rome, America has only spent a short time on the world stage. Despite studying political science in college, Duncan spent much of his free time studying ancient Greek and Latin texts. \\"I sort of stumbled into it, so I was reading a ton of Livy at the time, and a ton of Suetonius, and then I had just gotten into Tacitus.\\" Regarding modern history, Duncan has predicted that Silicon Valley may be seen in the future as groundbreaking as the Renaissance was, stating that “we have lived in the last twenty years through some of the most impressive advances in human civilization.”  Podcasts  =The History of Rome= Duncan began The History of Rome in 2007, after failing to find any good podcasts about ancient history. The project turned into an award-winning weekly podcast which aired for 179 episodes until 2012 and was downloaded more than 100 million times. The podcast covers the time period from the origin of the Roman Kingdom to the fall of the Western Roman Empire, focusing on the most accepted chain of events according to historical consensus. In the 2010 Podcast Awards, The History of Rome won best educational podcast. =Revolutions= Revolutions has aired since September 15, 2013. The podcast covers modern political revolutions, beginning with the English Revolution. Each season is dedicated to one revolution or revolutionary wave and discusses the revolution through a chronological narrative approach like in his podcast The History of Rome, but the shorter time periods for each season allow greater detail for individual events. Seasons begin with one or two episodes dedicated to the pre-history of the revolution and its causes, sometimes highlighting when and how the revolution could have been avoided. Initially, Duncan planned to limit his podcast to 12-15 episodes per revolution, but he ran over that self-imposed limit with the English Civil War and the American Revolution and decided to give up on it for the French Revolution, which ultimately ended up being 54 episodes not counting supplemental episodes. The series has covered the English Civil War, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, Simon Bolivar and Gran Colombia, the July Revolution, the Revolutions of 1848, the Paris Commune, the Mexican Revolution, and the Russian Revolution, which in January 2020 was announced to be the show's last. Revolutions also has supplemental episodes that are special episodes not counted in the normal number of episodes and of varying length compared to roughly half-hour normal episodes – some of them focus in depth on a particular topic or person, while others are verbatim reproductions of historical texts such as the United States Declaration of Independence or the French Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen. Duncan drew inspiration for the Revolutions podcast out of a deep personal interest from his teenage years, \\"When I was really getting into history when I was a teenager, the American Revolution was my favorite period of American history. I spent a whole period of time being really into the Russian Revolution.\\" As he had done with The History of Rome podcast, Duncan has run a series of tours to accompany the podcast which visit historical sites mentioned on the show. Publications including Time, Popular Mechanics, and The Guardian have included Revolutions on their lists of recommended podcasts. Benjamin Wittes, after hearing the first two episodes of Revolutions, called the podcast \\"informative, engaging, told in Duncan's usual easygoing, somewhat comic style that packs a lot of history into relatively brief discussions\\". The introduction to each episode is a clip from Joseph Haydn's Symphony 92 (Oxford). = Seasons of Revolutions = # English Revolution, aired September 2013 to January 2014 (16 episodes, 4 supplementals) # American Revolution, aired February to May 2014 (15 episodes, 2 supplementals) # French Revolution, aired July 2014 to November 2015 (55 episodes, 5 supplementals, 1 PSA) # Haitian Revolution, aired December 2015 to April 2016 (19 episodes, 1 supplemental) # Spanish American wars of independence, aired June 2016 to February 2017 (27 episodes, 1 supplemental) # July Revolution, aired March to May 2017 (7 episodes, 5 supplementals) # Revolutions of 1848, aired July 2017 to April 2018 (33 episodes, 0 supplementals) # Paris Commune, aired from May 2018 to June 2018 (8 episodes, 0 supplementals) # Mexican Revolution, aired August 2018 to March 2019 (27 episodes, 0 supplementals) # Russian Revolution pt 1, aired from May 2019 to April 2020 (39 episodes, 0 supplementals) # Russian Revolution pt 2, airing from Fall 2020 to Summer 2021 Books = The History of Rome: The Republic = Duncan published The History of Rome: The Republic, a collection of edited transcripts from the first 46 episodes of the podcast, opening with the founding of the Roman Kingdom and ending with the breakdown of the Roman Republic. = The Storm Before the Storm = On October 24, 2017, Duncan published The Storm Before The Storm, a non-fiction work which explores Rome between 146-78 BC, the period predating the end of the Roman Republic. It entered the New York Times best seller list Hardcover Non-Fiction on the eighth place during its first week. In an interview with the Washington Post Worldview, Duncan claimed his aim for the book was to 'pull back two generations' (from the time of Caesar) 'and ask, “What was it that opened the cracks in the foundation of the Republic?”' The book received widespread praise, with many reviewers noting how the events described in the book portend to modern times. Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare Blog wrote \\"Never has a book about history that's two millennia old been so timely...You'll learn as much about the problems we face today from this book as from any newspaper\\", and a review in the Huffington Post praised his \\"congenial style\\", claiming that he \\"zeros in on Rome’s polarization between “optimates” (conservatives) and “populares” (populists), the disintegration of participatory democracy, and the concomitant rise in inequality, uncivil discourse, and violence. The parallels with modern times, and particularly contemporary America, leap off the page\\". = Hero Of Two Worlds = Duncan is currently writing his third book, Hero Of Two Worlds: The Marquis de Lafayette in the Age of Revolution, about the Marquis de Lafayette during the American Revolution and the French Revolution. It is set to be published on June 15, 2021  Television  Duncan appears as a panel historian on seasons two and three of the Netflix documentary Roman Empire.  Influence  Benjamin Wittes directly modelled the introduction to the Lawfare Podcast on The History of Rome. Robin Pierson's podcast The History of Byzantium was explicitly modelled after The History of Rome in style, length and quality and was intended by Pierson to act as a sort of sequel to it. Similarly, Peter Adamson mentioned Duncan as one of the reasons he started his History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast. Rian Johnson was listening to the History of Rome podcast as he was writing the script for Star Wars Episode VIII.

Education and career Born Patricia Williams, she attended Wellesley College and then graduate school in philosophy at Princeton where she studied with George Pitcher. Kitcher has held faculty positions at the University of Vermont, the University of Minnesota, and University of California, San Diego, and a visiting position at University of Michigan. In 1998 she went to Columbia University where she became the Mark van Doren Professor of the Humanities and chair of the philosophy department. She lives in New York City with her husband, Philip Kitcher, also a philosopher at Columbia, with whom she has two sons, Andrew and Charles. She has served as department chair in three different universities and was the founding chair of the University of California committee on the status of women. She was also president of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, president of the North American Kant Society, and serves on the editorial board of Journal of Philosophy. Philosophical work Kitcher's interest in cognition manifested early and has continued to shape and inform her work throughout her career. Her doctoral dissertation defended a psychological continuity criterion for personal identity but extended the scope of the psychological criterion beyond that traditionally posited to include broader and more abstract cognitive characteristics, such as cognitive approach or cognitive style. Since then her work has ranged widely from traditional philosophy of psychology, to Sigmund Freud, and ultimately to her major interest, the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. In her early work Kitcher wrote a number of papers in philosophy of psychology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. She argued for the viability of intentional psychology and the autonomy of functionalist psychology from neurophysiology. Later work predominantly concentrated on analysis of problems stemming from the interpretation of Kant's first Critique. Kitcher has written numerous articles on the forms of intuition, Kant's epistemology, self-consciousness, and on how transcendental arguments work. Kitcher has written two books that also pursue psychological themes. Kant's Transcendental Psychology was a radical departure from most Kant exegesis. The book makes two main claims about the Critique of Pure Reason. First, contra Peter Frederick Strawson, Kitcher argues that to understand synthetic a priori knowledge, it is essential to consider transcendental psychology. Second, she explicates a Kantian argument for the necessity of an integrated thinking subject, which serves as a reply to David Hume's denial of the unity of the self. Kant's Thinker (2011), was called \\"an ambitious and challenging work\\" by Paul Guyer in the European Journal of Philosophy. In this book, she continues work on \\"a central theme of her earlier work: how to understand Kant's view of the unity of self-consciousness in the Critique of Pure Reason.\\" In Freud's Dream Kitcher argued that Freud was the first cognitive scientist: Psychoanalysis should be thought of as an exercise in interdisciplinary theory construction, and as such, it illuminates the pitfalls to which such interdisciplinary approaches are subject. (Kitcher jokes that her arguments managed to alienate all readers: Freudians, because she exposes the mistaken foundation of psychoanalysis, and anti-Freudians, because she portrays his program as scientifically legitimate.) Around the turn of the new century, Kitcher's interests turned toward Kantian ethics. Her works from this period provide an account of Kantian maxims and an interpretation of Kant's argument for the Formulation of the Universal Law for the Categorical Imperative.

Hucke with mandolin. George H. Hucke (1868 - 20 March 1903 in London) was a musician, playing both violin and mandolin, and he became one of the most popular English composers for the mandolin.Philip J. Bone, The Guitar and Mandolin, biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott and Co., 1914. Archive.org He was also the author of an 1893 mandolin method called Forty Progressive Studies for the Mandoline, published by John Alvey Turner. Part of the BMG movement. Education His father, Heinrich Hucke, of German nationality, was a pupil of Louis Spohr, and was employed for several years as violinist in the Court Orchestra of Hesse Cassel, under the conductorship of his teacher. George and his three brothers were destined for a musical career, being taught the violin by their father, who was a stern disciplinarian regarding their musical studies. The boys were not permitted recreation, meals, or sleep until their tasks were satisfactorily completed. At eight years of age George Hucke came under the instruction of Dr. John Hartmann, bandmaster to the Duke of Cambridge; he continued with him for several years and gained practical experience in orchestral work. Ten years later Hucke was appointed musical amanuensis to Canon Harford, a well-known musical authority at Westminster Abbey, and was employed there until his death at age thirty-five. Mandolin Cover of Forty Progressive Studies for the Mandoline by George H. Hucke. Hucke established a successful music teaching studio with his brothers in Hammersmith, London. At that time, interest in the mandolin was on the rise. Since the violin had been his particular instrument, it was natural he should consider adopting the mandolin. He composed music for the instrument and sent his first compositions to J. A. Turner, London — then the only English publisher of mandolin music — and the publisher encouraged him to continue. He spent the next ten years writing, during a time of great demand for suitable mandolin publications. In 1893 Turner published his Forty progressive studies for the mandolin, Op. 50, which rank amongst the best issued in England. These were followed by many other original works, including over a dozen complete volumes. No less than forty-five original compositions were published by Turner, as well as his arrangements of songs. Among those pieces for mandolin and piano were Beneath thy window, Poppies and wheat, and Eventide. These enjoyed wide popularity, but he wrote \\"more advanced\\" works which Philip J. Bone called \\"examples of his melodic and musicianly ability\\". These include Sonatine, Air Varie, and Overture, all for piano and mandolin. In addition to compositions for the mandolin and violin, Hucke wrote a number of albums, pieces, and a tutor for the guitar, and also organ music.

The Game is a co-op third-person shooter video game developed by Saber Interactive and published by Atlus USA. It was released on July 17, 2013 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows. The game is primarily a survival mode, and is based on the film R.I.P.D.. The gameplay is derived from Old School Game's previous game, God Mode. Players in R.I.P.D. The Game are able to play as Roy Pulsipher or Nick Walker in a cooperative horde mode gametype against renegade ghosts also known as \\"deadoes\\", who stay on earth to avoid their fate in the afterlife. Matches are composed of five rounds with each round increasing in difficulty compared to the last. Players are able to buy and upgrade weapons using in game currency. These weapons include a standard arsenal of shotguns, assault rifles, and references to the movie such as a banana or a hairdryer. Enemies can be defeated through in game firearms or by standing next to marked enemies in order to arrest them.  Plot  R.I.P.D. The Game summarizes the events of the movie, covering Nick Walker's death, to his arrival at the afterlife law enforcement agency, the R.I.P.D. The stylized comic also introduces Nick Walker's partner, Roy Pulsipher, a nineteenth-century law enforcer who also works for the R.I.P.D. The introductory comic also informs the player of motives of the monsters, referred to as \\"deadoes\\", and depicts them stealing gold artifacts but leaves their ulterior motives a mystery. However, this is the only cutscene, and the game immediately drops the player in a tutorial afterwards.  Gameplay  R.I.P.D. The Game is a third-person shooter that has players gunning down monsters called \\"deadoes\\", in a horde mode with one other player cooperatively across online matchmaking. There are seven maps for the seven missions and a final boss at the end of each one. At the end of each level, bounties are collected from surviving all five waves of enemies. The game also provides challenges for the player to complete to earn more points at the end of a match. One of the game's unique features is betting, which allows the player to bet in game currency on who will get the most points at the end of a match. The player's main way of interacting with the world is through shooting or grenades to defeat enemies, however some enemies may be marked for arrest which is done by standing near the marked enemy for the specified time limit. At the end of each round, players may buy new weapons or upgrades for existing ones. Achievements can be earned through in-game actions, which include references to the movie.  Reception  R.I.P.D. The Game received negative reviews. The game holds an average of 39% and 42% on aggregate websites Metacritic and GameRankings. The majority of complaints about R.I.P.D. The Game are its lack of story, repetitive mechanics, and its similarity to Old School Game's previous entry, God Mode.

As per the Constitutional provisions of Nepal, after the commencement of impeachment proceedings, the person in question shall not be allowed to discharge the duties of his or her office pending the settlement of such proceedings. Controversies = Indian Interference in Nepal = Lok Man has been accused of using Indian Spy Agency to persuade Nepalese politicians to appoint him as the chief of CIAA.( Mafia) One of the crupted civil servent ,history of Nepal .The committee of senior political leaders that had recommended Lok Man's appointment and the then President of Nepal Dr. Ram Baran Yadav who appointed Lok Man have been accused of acting at the R&AW;(India's external spy agency)'s behest. After the CIAA opened a probe against Kanak Dikshit, the journalist publicly said RA&W; had been behind Karki’s appointment. After the impeachment motion was moved, the Republic and Kantipur media groups alleged that Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rae had lobbied to save Karki. Numerous articles published in Nepalese media also cite instances of power misuse by Lok Man that clearly benefited India in matters of dispute with Nepal. =Appointment as the Commissioner of CIAA, 2013= Karki was controversially appointed as the Chief Commissioner of CIAA on May 8, 2013 by President Rambaran Yadav on recommendation of Constitutional Council for a term of six years. He was accused of suppressing the People's Movement II and was recommended by Rayamajhi Aayog for criminal proceedings.https://eadarsha.com/%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF/ He was the chief secretary of the government under the direct rule of Former King Gyanendra Shah, and faced massive criticisms from different civil society members, media and political parties including Nepali Congress and CPN (UML). The Girija Prasad Koirala-led government, formed after the success of the 2006 movement, had also decided to sack him from the position of chief secretary and disqualify him from holding any public position in future “for using state apparatus against the pro-democratic protesters”. He also faced allegations that he was involved in various scandals, including a gold smuggling case, when he was working as the director general at Tribhuvan International Airport. He has also been charged several times, although informally, by many civil servants of misusing his power. He has also been allegedly charged for controlling and informally making decisions of Nepal Medical Council misusing his post and power. On 19 September 2016,157 lawmakers of CPN(UML) and CPN Maoist-Centre filed an impeachment motion against the Karki. However the impeachment motion was never submitted for vote in the Parliament. The Special Bench of the Supreme Court, constituting Justices Ishwor Prasad Khatiwada, Dr. Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Anil Kumar Sinha, had that the appointment of Mr. Karki was unconstitutional as Mr. Karki lacked requisite legal and moral qualifications for the post of the Chief Commissioner of the CIAA. The Court among others held that Mr. Karki did not have 20 years experience in the government in the field of development, law, engineering, finance as required by the Constitution and importantly lacked \\"high moral standing\\" required by the Constitution. In holding that Mr. Karki lacked high moral standing, the Court held that he himself was charged with corruption by the CIAA for alleged smuggling of gold while he headed Internal Revenue Department; was found guilty of human rights violations and abuse of official powers of the Chief Secretary during the suppression of people's movement of April 2006; and lying to the Court regarding his experience as the Chief Secretary of the government of Nepal (although the government had replaced Karki with a new chief secretary in 2006, Mr. Karki had lied to the Court that he remained as the Chief Secretary until his resignation in 2007). = Get Well Soon Lokman = On 27 July 2016, the party protested against the chief of CIAA who did not appear at the meeting of Good Governance and Monitoring Committee (GGMC) of the Parliament held at Singha Durbar citing health problems. The GMCC had invited Lokman Karki and the other commissioners to discuss the accusations that the CIAA had interfered in MD & MS entrance examination at Kathmandu University against the principal of academic jurisdiction by holding the examinations on their own. In the letter to the committee he stated that he had a throat infection and doctors had advised him not to speak for a week. = Interference in Medical Education Sector = Lokaman has been accused of interfering in medical education sector from time to time for his personal and family gains. During his leadership at CIAA, CIAA had interfered in many decisions of Nepal Medical Council including allocation of seats to medical colleges. The Kist Medical College, promoted by his brother Balman Singh Karki, has received privileged treatment despite having mixed reputation either as a center for learning or a medical facility. Manmohan Memorial Institute of Health Sciences, where majority of the shareholders are CPN-UML members, the CIAA had written to the Tribhuvan University asking it to make arrangements for granting affiliation to it. The Government is currently working to acquire the MMHIS for the Manmohan Memorial National Academy of Health Sciences. =Face to face with Govinda KC = Dr Govinda KC, orthopaedic surgeon of Tribhuvan University Techching hospital, who has staged hunger-strikes from time to time demanding reforms in Medical Education demanded impeachment and investigation of properties of Lokman. Dr KC accused Karki of protecting corrupt people in medical education sector and breaching his jurisdiction to interfere into Kathmandu University. He also accused Karki of obstructing overall process of reform of medical education including merit- based admission and ceiling on fees to serve business interests of people close to him. In the response, CIAA issued official statement alleging Dr KC was mentally sick person and he needed medical help. It angered citizens and political parties who have been in solidarity with Dr KC on his hunger-strikes for medical education reform.http://peoplesreview.com.np/2016/07/13/govinda- kc-vs-lokman-singh/ See also * Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), Nepal References Category:Living people Category:1956 births ","title":"Lokman Singh Karki"},{"id":"40081265","text":"Palani railway station is a train station serving Tamil Nadu's pilgrim town of Palani situated in the western part of the state.

It was published on April 1, 2014 by Hachette Book Group, an imprint of Little, Brown and Company. The book is the third in the Daughter of Smoke and Bone trilogy, following Days of Blood and Starlight. The story continues where Days of Blood and Starlight leaves off, and concerns the invasion of Earth by the Seraph Empire and the alliance between the Misbegotten.  Plot  After killing Thiago while defending herself from him, Karou puts Ziri's soul in his body and Haxaya's in Ten's body, allowing her to lead the Chimaera. When Zuzana and Mick come bearing news of Jael's arrival on Earth, the new Chimaera leadership is able to negotiate an alliance with the Misbegotten. They have to learn to make peace and to not wipe each other out if they are to work together against the Dominion. Eliza Jones is a 24-year- old researcher in Washington, D.C., where she is working on her Ph.D. As a girl, she escaped a cult that worshipped her as a prophet and descendant of the angel Elazael. She has visions in her dreams of monsters coming from the sky. When the recently abandoned camp of the Chimaera in Morocco is found and the pit is excavated, her boss is called in to analyse it, and she travels with him. Seeing the corpses of the Chimaera triggers more visions. Jael has arrived with his soldiers, the Dominion, in Vatican City. Aided by Razgut, he portrays his forces as the angels from human mythology and asks humanity for help defeating devils; once he is armed with modern human technology, he intends to wipe out the Stelians. Akiva is discovered by Stelian emissaries who, following his accidental disruption of the fabric of the universe while casting a spell, intend to kill him. They realise he is the child of Festival, and follow him invisibly. Ziri, as Thiago, rescues Liraz from Haxaya, whom Liraz had killed an earlier incarnation of. Akiva figures out how to make the seraph soldiers invulnerable to the effects of Chimaera hamsas. The allied army travels to the portal to stop the Dominion, but are ambushed on the way, and Ziri and Liraz are presumed dead. On Earth, Karou, Akiva, Zuzana, Mik, and a Chimaera soldier discover Eliza, speaking prophecies in Seraphim, on their way to the Vatican. They are assisted by Esther, until she sells them out to Jael in exchange for the mining rights to Eretz. Esther throws Zuzana and Mik out of her hotel room, but they steal the stash of wishes given to her by Brimstone. Karou and Akiva attempt to infiltrate Jael's lodgings, but are expected. However, using the same spell Akiva used to synchronise the burning of Brimstone's portals, they are able to set an incendiary charge on Jael and force him to return to Eretz unarmed. Zuzana and Mik wish for Eliza to be returned to her best possible self, and she regains her memories as Elazael and transforms into a Seraphim. In Eretz, the Misbegotten and Chimera alliance has managed to convert the rest of the armed forces to their cause, and upon returning Jael is imprisoned. Ziri has died, but Liraz has gleaned his soul, and he is resurrected. Eliza, Mik, and Zuzana return to Eretz through another portal known to Elazael. The Stelians arrive to confront Akiva, whose magic has been damaging the fabric of the universe, endangering Eretz. Eliza tells the history of Eretz and reveals that the creation myth the Seraphim have involving \\"Godstars\\" is in fact a prophecy, and they are destined to battle the beasts that threaten Eretz together.  Critical reception  Publishers Weekly gave Dreams of Gods and Monsters a starred review.

In the 2010 podcast awards, THoR won best educational podcast. THoR covers the time period from the origin of the Roman Kingdom to the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, focusing on the most accepted chain of events according to historical consensus. Origins Duncan came up with the idea of THoR on a bit of a fluke while looking for something to entertain himself during a long plane ride and subsequent vacation. After a recommendation from a colleague, Duncan browsed through a few online history lectures in search of something to pass the time. While surfing through these lectures, through a series of links Duncan stumbled upon the 12 Byzantine Rulers podcast from Lars Brownworth, listened to a few episodes, and thought “This is really cool!”. However, when he searched for similar podcasts on the history of Rome, he could find none. Immediately, Mike was inspired to “do something like” Brownworth's podcast. He had had a longstanding interest in Roman history and was reading The War With Hannibal by Livy at the time. He enjoyed many of the historical episodes he encountered in the book, but realized that much of the public knew little about Rome outside of Caesar’s and Augustus’ time. One of Duncan's motivators for creating the podcast was to make the whole of Roman history attractive to the public through the form of a podcast. Making of the podcast Duncan researched extensively before each episode, relying on primary sources such as Livy and Tacitus as much as possible, while using secondary or modern sources to help judge the verity and objectivity of each source. In making the podcast, Duncan read almost exclusively about Roman history. Each show required Duncan 10 to 12 hours prep time, in addition to countless hours reading source material throughout the week. Duncan would aim to keep his episodes at around 4000 words. When recording, he would run two parallel tracks in GarageBand to preempt any errors, and would do a preparatory reading beforehand. He finished each podcast with a celebratory beer. Duncan has mentioned that in making the podcast, he learned “human nature has changed very little,” and that people generally respond to the same situations in the same sorts of ways. “I don’t think we’re so completely different than any Roman was.” The soundtrack which begins and ends each podcast comes from the GarageBand snippet Acoustic Picking 18. Tours As an extension to the podcast, Duncan has led recurring guided tours around Rome, also visiting Ostia, Pompeii, Capri, and the field of Cannae; the tours walk through many sites mentioned in The History of Rome.  Books  On June 4, 2016, Duncan's book, The History of Rome: The Republic (Volume 1) was published. The book is a collection of edited transcripts from the first 46 episodes of the podcast, covering the time period from the founding of the Roman Kingdom through the breakdown of the Republic. In October 2017, Duncan's book The Storm Before the Storm: The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic, was published by PublicAffairs, an imprint of Hachette Book Group. Legacy and influence The History of Byzantium podcast by Robin Pierson is explicitly modelled after The History of Rome in style, length and quality; Pierson intended the podcast as a sequel to The History of Rome in order to complete the story. David Crowther of The History of England podcast has mentioned Duncan as an influence. as has Peter Adamson of the podcast: The History of Philosophy without any Gaps. Isaac Meyer of the History of Japan podcast has mentioned in a few episodes that The History of Rome podcast inspired the \\"A day in the life of...\\" episodes. Duncan has mentioned in turn being greatly inspired by the prior work of Lars Brownworth. Duncan has said he hopes that other history podcasters will follow his mantra and stick to \\"just the content\\" without a lot of \\"extraneous babbling\\", in order to give their podcasts as professional a feel as possible - thus making the podcast an educational experience geared to learning the subject of the podcast. Duncan mentioned on Podcast Squared consistency as critical to building an audience and being respectful to their time and advises every podcaster to set a deadline and stick with it. \\"If you can get (people) on a routine and looking forward to (the podcast), they’ll stick around\\".

The action of removing aquatic plant life in such a manner has been referred to as \\"aquatic harvesting\\". Overview Water is an important resource and in many countries, waterways are increasingly clogged by aquatic plant growth. This is particularly so in tropical countries where warmer water means the plants grow more quickly, and increasing run-off of fertilisers and effluent has exacerbated the problem. Irrigation ditches and pumps can become overgrown with vegetation, power station and factory water intakes can get blocked, boats can get hindered, fish stocks can be disrupted, and water moves more slowly, resulting in greater evapotranspiration and a greater risk of flooding. In some large irrigation projects in India, canals have become so overgrown with vegetation that water flow has been reduced to a fifth of its previous amount. In Bangladesh, floodwater has washed mats of water hyacinth onto paddy fields, overwhelming the emerging rice crops. Small fish can become entangled in excessive algal growth. A pond in Odessa, Ukraine covered with water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) Rice is the main aquatic plant grown for human food, but smaller areas of watercress and water chestnut are also cultivated. In their native environments, aquatic weeds are part of a balanced ecosystem, and it is mainly introduced species of water plant that become invasive and cause problems by congesting water bodies. The worst culprits, found in both temperate and tropical waterways, are floating plants such as water hyacinth, water lettuce and Salvinia, fully submerged rooting plants such as Hydrilla and water milfoil and rooting plants that reach the surface such as cattail, papyrus, bulrush and reed. Weed harvesting equipment Weed cutting boats are developed to enable the maintenance of canals, lakes and rivers and to remove excessive aquatic life such as algae and other plants that may negatively affect a waterway's ecology. Mechanical harvesters are large floating machines that have underwater cutting blades that sever the stems of underwater plants, gather the weeds and raise them on conveyor belts, storing the vegetation on board in a hold. Periodically this is discharged to a barge or an onshore facility. The harvested product can be composted, sent to a landfill site or used in land reclamation. In developing countries aquatic vegetation may be harvested by hand or by net from the shore, cut and harvested by boat and lifted ashore by hand, crane, pump or conveyor system. The harvested vegetation may be used for the feeding of livestock. To reduce the high moisture content and to make it easier to transport, the weed can be chopped and pressed. Other uses to which the harvested vegetation can be put include ensiling the material for livestock fodder, adding it to the soil as a bulky organic fertilizer, manufacturing the raw material into pulp, paper or fibre, and fermenting it to produce methane for energy production. Advantages and disadvantages Mechanical harvesters can be effective at clearing aquatic weeds but the machines are expensive and the process may need to be repeated several times in a growing season. Small fragments of weed remain in the water and may spread to other locations thereby aiding in the dispersal of invasive species. Some areas may be too shallow for the mechanical harvester and it may be unable to access restricted locations. Submerged tree stumps can damage the machine. Aquatic weeds can also be utilized as a source of biofuel. An alternative to mechanical harvesting is the use of herbicides, which are easy to apply and less expensive, but may have unwanted adverse impacts on the environment. By region =Africa= Water hyacinth growing in Lake Victoria at Kisumu In June 2015 in Uganda, use of the aquatic weed harvester was recommended by the country's Ministry of Agriculture to reduce water hyacinth growth in Lake Victoria, which has caused a scarcity of fish in the lake. The scarcity of fish has negatively-affected the livelihood of locals who live in the lake's region. Additional types of machines were recommended to address the problem, which were the hydraulic harvester, take out elevator and dredger. =India= A mowing boat In August 2015 in Hyderabad, India, an aquatic weed harvester was used to remove algal weeds and trash from Hussainsagar Lake. An amphibious hydraulic excavator was also used. The work was performed to address pollution problems at the lake, which had accumulated significant algae and rubbish such as plastic bags and plastic waste, food wrappers, and various garbage, some of which was floating atop the lake. =United States= Some U.S. companies manufacture aquatic weed harvesters. One such machine manufactured by a U.S. company can cut around one-half an acre of weeds a day, and costs over $100,000. Tampa, Florida used an aquatic weed harvester in 2013 to clear aquatic plant life from lakes in the area. In 2012 in Leoni, Michigan, an aquatic weed harvester was used to remove algae from Center Lake. The algae appeared to have roots, and other techniques such as attempting to kill it with chemicals were unsuccessful. The machine used collects algae and weeds that live at the bottom of the lake, removing them from the waterway.

It is responsible for all of the BBC's digital media services including BBC Online, BBC Red Button and BBC iPlayer, BBC mobile apps, internal technology services, technology procurement and BBC Research & Development. It is headed by the Chief Technology and Product Officer; Matthew Postgate. History =BBC Online (1994)= The BBC has had an online presence supporting its TV and radio programmes and web-only initiatives since 1994 but did not launch officially until December 1997, following government approval to fund it by TV licence revenue as a service in its own right.Brandon Butterworth's History Of Online BBC, 2007 It is a large network of websites including such high-profile sites as: BBC News and Sport, the on- demand video and radio services co-branded BBC iPlayer, the pre-school site CBeebies, and learning services such as Bitesize. Throughout its short history, the online plans of the BBC have been subject to harassment from its commercial rivals. This resulted in various public consultations and government reviews to investigate their claims that its large presence and public funding distorts the UK market. BBC Red Button launched in September 1999 as a branding for digital interactive television services provided by the BBC, and broadcast in the United Kingdom. The services replaced Ceefax, the BBC's analogue teletext service, and is only available via digital television receivers. The service can be accessed via Digital terrestrial television(DTT) (DVB-T), satellite television (DVB-S) and cable television(DVB-C). The \\"Red Button\\" branding is no longer used within the BBC own website. =BBC Technology Ltd sell off (2004)= In 2004, BBC Technology Ltd, a commercial subsidiary of the BBC who provided technology and broadcast support and services was sold to Siemens IT Solutions and Services (SIS) under a 10-year Technology Framework Contract (TFC) worth almost £2bn.BBC closes deal with Siemens, BBC Press Office 1 October 2004 Siemens was purchased by Atos Information Technology Incorporated in 2011 who continue to hold the contract. BBC Future Media & Technology continued as an internal division for managing this contract and other technology projects. =BBC iPlayer (2007)= BBC iPlayer was launched in 2007. This provides internet television and radio service and software application, developed by the BBC to extend its former RealPlayer-based and other streamed video clip content to include whole TV shows. =DMI (2008-2013)= The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was broadcast engineering project launched by the BBC Technology division in 2008. It aimed to modernise the Corporation's production and archiving methods by using connected digital production and media asset management systems. After a protracted development process lasting five years with a spend of £98 million between 2010 and 2012, the project was abandoned in May 2013. =BBC Future Media (2011)= The original Future Media & Technology division was divided as a part of a corporate restructure within the BBC in 2011. The idea for the division was conceived in 2011 to connect all areas of the BBC's digital viewing platforms. The concept was to create a more streamlined business function that can respond more quickly to future developments in the industry. According to the Guardian Newspaper \\"The BBC's online presence now is like TV was in 1963. They still do not know what they are doing. It's about combining an understanding of technology, editorial and the BBC – and there's still not enough people in the business that understand all three.\\" Some staff were moved from London and other locations to the new MediaCityUK development in Salford. From 1 April 2015 BBC Future Media was renamed BBC Digital, while BBC Technology was renamed as BBC Engineering. =BBC Design & Engineering (2016)= BBC Design & Engineering was created in 2016 when Matthew Postgate was appointed as Chief Technology Office for a new division that brings together BBC Digital, Engineering and BBC Worldwide technology teams, thus re- amalgamating departments separated by previous internal restructures.Matthew Postgate profile, BBC Management Structure, Accessed 22 February 2017 Subsidiary Departments * BBC Research & Development See also * BBC * BBC Research & Development * Internet television * Web television * Video on demand References External links *BBC Design + Engineering Category:BBC divisions Online ","title":"BBC Design &amp; Engineering"},{"id":"40081427","text":"Zinc finger, DHHC-type containing 14 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ZDHHC14 gene.

The proposed experiment station was named La Granja Modelo de Luzon (The Model Farm of Luzon). They applied for a royal grant in the same year, and it was granted in 1874. The granja will serve an experiment station for their company, Coteron y Compañia, for propagation, experimentation and cultivation of their cash crops especially in tobacco. It has 300 hectares of land, located in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, and took years to construct necessary structures. On November 15, 1881, with the creation of La Comision Agronomica de Filipinas, it took over the operations of granja and appointed its first director, Don Jose Alemany Penalva. Due to the insufficient and poor condition of the land, on March 20, 1885, the Spanish government transferred the granja from San Isidro, Nueva Ecija to the foothills of Mt. Arayat in Magalang, Pampanga. Its governing charter was issued by Queen Maria Christina on January 30, 1886. The new land has 900 hectares, cleared mostly by the polistas. The granja was transformed into a full agricultural experiment station equipped with school and staff buildings, animal pens, sugar mill, alcohol distillery and weather observatory. The station was headed by a director (equivalent to agricultural engineer), assisted by an ayundante de montes and a perito agricola, who were all Spaniards. It also housed a 50-man companias disciplinarias providing rotational security to the granja. The granja offered two programs; the first and most important was a three-year sequence in farm management, leading to the title of perito agricola. The candidates who wanted this title had to demonstrate the possession of suitable secondary-level schooling in geometry, trigonometry, drawing physics, and chemistry, prior to entrance. The other program, which conferred the title of capataz de cultivo, concerned itself with the preparation of field foremen and livestock supervisors. Those who obtained these titles were conferred as graduates equivalent to a college graduate both in the Philippines and Spain. The granja has a variety of breeds of animals such as buffaloes, cattle, wild pigs, goats, horses, chickens, ducks and doves. La Granja was devoted to the cultivation and experimentation of wheat, sorghum, sesame, rice, corn, indigo, tobacco, peanuts, potatoes, sugarcane and alfalfa. On June 30, 1887, La Granja Modelo de Luzon won the highest diploma honor award from Exposicion de Filipinas held in Madrid, Spain in the field of agriculture, especially in the cultivation and exhibition of tobacco and different varieties of corn. (La Granja Modelo won the award together with famous Filipinos such as Juan Luna who won the same award for his masterpiece, Una Mestiza; Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, gold medal awardee for his masterpiece, La Barca de Aqueronte; and the father of Filipino socialism, Isabelo de los Reyes, silver medal awardee for his selection, Folklore Filipina.) In 1891, the granja was transformed by Governor General Valeriano Weyler into La Escuela Pecuaria (the Livestock School). The school was expanded, focusing on the study and breeding of cattle. In 1894, the weather observatory become fully operational with telegraph lines connected with the Observatorio de Manila. In 1895, the granja pioneered the experiment and study of different Central American varieties of peanuts and teosintes. On January 23, 1894, it won the silver medal award from Exposicion Regional de Filipinas in the field of cross breeding of Arabian horses, exhibition of different rice varieties and different types of farm equipment. At the outbreak of the revolution, it was used as one of the hideouts of the Spanish troops fighting the insurgents in Camansi. During the Philippine–American War, it served as a grazing area for cavalry horses and a training ground for American troops. After the war, on November 26, 1901, the Department of Public Instruction recommended the establishing of an agricultural school in granja, but it was never implemented. In 1902, it was reopened by the Americans as an agricultural experiment station under Bureau of Agriculture, with Lt. Col. Charles Hatfield designated officer in charge. On July 26, 1904, Governor General Luke Edward Wright issued Executive Order No. 33 declaring additional areas to expand the experiment station's area to 1,050 hectares and naming it as the Magalang Reserve, to be used for agricultural experiment purposes. On 1918, it started to offer agricultural intermediate and high school education and named as Magalang Farm School and later as Pampanga Agricultural School; Frank Ebbesen was appointed the first principal. Subsequently, Commonwealth Act No. 313, enacted in 1938, made the school a national institution and named it as Pampanga National Agricultural School. During World War II, it was shut down and became a military training camp of the Japanese forces. After the war, it reopened and continued operations. The Huk insurgency forced the school to suspend classes until peace and order returned in 1955. On June 19, 1965, President Diosdado P. Macapagal signed Republic Act No. 4576, upgrading the school to tertiary level to become the Pampanga Agricultural College. It completed its upgrading to college status in 1974, with Supt. Felix V. Remigio appointed first college president. Upon his retirement, Dr. Fortunato Battad was installed college president on April 7, 1976. Upon the transfer of Dr. Battad in 1983, Dr. Fredeswinda R. Serrano was designated officer-in-charge from November to December, 1983. Subsequently, Dr. Ladislao Avila was designated officer-in-charge until April 30, 1984. On May 1, 1984, Dr. Ramon Simbulan was designated by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos as acting president of the college. On July 25, 1986, he was appointed as full-fledged president of the college by President Corazon C. Aquino. He was appointed to a second term by President Fidel V. Ramos. Dr. Simbulan was succeeded by Dr. Zosimo M. Battad, who in turn was succeeded by Dr. Honorio Soriano Jr., who remains college president to the present. During Soriano's administration, on June 11, 2013, Republic Act No. 10605 was signed into law by President Benigno S. Aquino III, converting the college into a state university as Pampanga State Agricultural University. The Commission on Higher Education was tasked by the law to evaluate the college for its compliance with the requirements for university status. On January 13, 2015, CHED issued En Banc Resolution No. 006-2015, officially granting the full university status to the college; it was the first state college in the Philippines granted university status by CHED based on merits.Bartolo, Louie Aldrin and Dizon, Lino.

Life  After attending the Ortwein school in Graz in 1999, Christian Eisenberger studied Transmediale Kunst in the class of Brigitte Kowanz at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 2000 to 2004. In 2013 he participated in the artist in residence programme of one world foundation (in cooperation with Galerie Krinzinger) in Sri Lanka.Cf. owf.at: artist in residence Christian Eisenberger lives and works in Vienna and Semriach.  Work  Christian Eisenberger initially became known for thousands of painted cardboard cutoutsBBC – Glasgow and West Scotland – In Pictures – Merchant City Festival which he, at first anonymously, placed in public space. His motifs were social outcasts, such as immigrants or beggars. Later on, he portrayed famous figures of world history, often adorned with halos. These portraits were typically marked with a number, the last of them carrying the number 9975.1. The ephemeral nature of this early series can still be found in many of his works today. Christian Eisenberger's work as a whole defies exact categorization.Spiegler, Almuth. \\"Gute Kunst? Ein bisserl narrisch, aber furios\\", Die Presse, Vienna, 26 August 2008. Retrieved on 27 June 2013. However, it is often associated with Land art, Conceptual art, Arte Povera, Appropriation, Video art and others. Eisenberger's art also contains numerous references to classical genres, such as expressionist painting and sculpture. The themes around which his work revolves are equally diverse, as he treats classical subjects of art history (life, death, vanitas motives) as well as political topics, such as criticism of institutions. His art creates a universe that is complex without being melodramatic. The artist typically works in series, often elaborating individual ideas and concepts throughout several years, which causes his work to grow radially rather than linearly.

Career Solås is a graduate of the Musikkonservatoriet i Oslo and got a German state scholarship for further studies at the Academy of Music in Köln. In 1968 he earned a magisters of Musicology at the Universitetet i Oslo, with the thesis \\"En studie i Harald Sæverud's scenemusikk til Peer Gynt\\" (A study in Harald Sæverud's incidental music to Peer Gynt). Solås was active as an actor and composer at the «Teater Neuf» (Student theater), and «Teaterverkstedet» in Oslo 1950-70. He was awarded the Order of Student Theatre «Den Hvide Knap» in 1958 and received the degree of Knight. During many years he was also active as a professional actor at the places «Riksteatret», «Teater Ibsen» and in several revues by Ole Paus. The theater was the basis for Solås's development as a composer, and he himself said: «In particular, I received a number of stylistic challenges and a growing understanding of music as an essential part of a larger artistic context». Together with Reidar Skagestad, Solås built up the music and theater line at «Romerike Folkehøgskole». In his educational work and as an employee of radio and television, he has had the opportunity to try out musical ideas in a variety of fields, including speaking choir and sound art in radio drama context. Solås has composed music for the Norwegian films Liten Ida (1981), Den sommeren jeg fylte 15 (1976) og Brannen (1973). He has also been active writing music for various music magazines. In 1993 he published the book Ensom vandrer: fantasier og refleksjoner i Edvard Griegs landskap (Lonely wanderer: fantasies and reflections in Edvard Grieg's landscapes). From 1969 Solås worked in NRK. He was music director in television from 1988 to 1990. In 1996 he moved to the music editors of the radio channel NRK P2. He created a number of programs in which he portrayed Norwegian composers and performers, including Musikknytt on TV in the period 1972–86. This was a music magazine that provoked much discussion and attention, especially because the journalistic presentation had elements of a distinctive form of gjøglerisk absurdism. He joined the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation in 2002, and also produced several short humor fixture on television in the 1980s, like 'the music professor' and 'the composer', from Musikknytt is the characters best known to the TV viewers. Solås met with Hitlers's arms minister and close collaborator Albert Speer spring 1980 in conjunction with work on a series for the NRK on music and the National Socialism. On that occasion he received an interview with Speer at his residence. Works *1968: \\"En studie i Harald Sæveruds scenemusikk til Peer Gynt\\", (Master's thesis UiO) *1993: \\"Ensom vandrer.

Description The pinhead pearlfish is a slender, tapering, eel-like fish that can grow to a length of . It has very small eyes and near the jaws are star-shaped melanophores which are more numerous in older specimens. This fish has no scales or pelvic fins, but does have short pectoral fins and an elongated dorsal fin with 31 to 42 soft rays. The equally long anal fin has 45 to 57 soft rays, and C. boraborensis is the only species in the family to have melanophores on its anal fins. It is a medium brown- coloured fish with a solid body and much enlarged swim bladder that occupies most of its body cavity. Distribution The pinhead pearlfish is found in the Indo-Pacific Ocean at depths to . Its range extends from Mauritius and the Society Islands, northwards to Taiwan and the Yaeyama Islands, including the Mariana Islands and Caroline Islands. Biology E. boraborensis is normally found living within the body cavity of a sea cucumber which it enters through the anus. The leopard sea cucumber (B. argus) is favoured and the pineapple sea cucumber (T. ananas) is also used for this purpose. Competition between carapid fish occurs for the right to occupy a host. Two male adults were observed to fight when inside the sea cucumber until one was killed, other fish have been found with bite marks on its tail and one adult was found to have a juvenile silver pearlfish (Encheliophis homei) in its stomach. Whereas Encheliophis homei emerges at night from its host to forage, Encheliophis boraborensis, with its small eyes and specialised mouthparts, may at least in part feed on its host's tissues. When E. boraborensis enters a host and finds a carapid fish already present, it makes a noise. The sounds emitted are regular pulses and the timing in males and females is different, so it is possible to tell the sex of the fish from the sounds it makes. If the fish already present is the closely related silver pearlfish, the sound is often reduced to a single longer pulse. When E. homei enters a sea cucumber already occupied by E. boraborensis, the sound it emits is also often reduced to a single pulse, but in this case it is shorter than its normal call. Both fish are able to change their calls, adapting them to whichever species of fish they encounter inside their hosts.

The KPI driven code analysis - developed at the Hasso Plattner Institute - is a static program analysis of source code for the purpose of improving software quality. However, the KPI driven code analysis does not only analyze the source code. Other information sources, such as coding activities, are also included to create a comprehensive impression of the quality and development progress of a software system.  Mode of operation  KPI driven code analysis is a fully automated process which thus enables team activities and modifications to the overall source code of a software system to be monitored in real time. In this way, negative trends become evident as soon as they arise. This “early warning system” thus offers a powerful instrument for reducing costs and increasing development speed. Through the early-warning approach of KPI driven code analysis, every newly introduced level of complexity is discovered in good time and its impact can thus be minimized. Instead of wasting valuable time trying to reduce legacy complexities, developers can use their time for new functionality, helping the team increase productivity.  The human factor  The “human factor” is included in the KPI driven code analysis which means that it also looks at which code was registered by which developer and when. In this way, the quality of software delivered by each individual developer can be determined and any problems in employee qualification, direction and motivation can be identified early and appropriate measures introduced to resolve them.  Sources considered  In order to determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) – figures which are crucial to the productivity and success of software development projects – numerous data sources related to the software code are read out. For this purpose, KPI driven code analysis borrows methods taken from data mining and business intelligence, otherwise used in accounting and customer analytics. The KPI driven code analysis extracts data from the following sources and consolidates them in an analysis data model. On this data model, the values of the key performance indicators are calculated. The data sources include, in particular: * Revision Control, also known as version control. In this system every step of each individual developer is tracked for the entire life cycle of the software system. The data describes: “Which developer changed what when.” This data provides a basis for answering the question, “What effort or development cost has been invested in which areas of code?” Prominent revision control systems are Subversion, Git, Perforce, Mercurial, Synergy, ClearCase, … * Software Test Systems. These provide a read-out as to which parts of the source code have already been tested. With this information, it becomes obvious where there are gaps in testing, possibly even where these gaps were intentionally left (due to the significant cost and effort involved in setting up tests). * Bug Tracking Systems (Bug Tracker). This information can be used in combination with the information provided by the revision control system to help draw conclusions on the error rate of particular areas of code. * Issue tracking systems. The information produced by these systems, in conjunction with the information from revision control, enables conclusions to be drawn regarding development activity related to specific technical requirements. In addition, precise data on time investment can be utilized for the analysis. * Performance profilers (Profiling (computer programming)). The data on the performance of the software system help to analyze which areas of code consume the most CPU resources.  Analysis results  Due to the many influencing factors which feed into the analysis data model, methods of optimizing the source code can be identified as well as requirements for action in the areas of employee qualification, employee direction and development processes: * Knowledge as to where source code needs to be reworked because it is too complex or has an inferior runtime performance: ** Deep nesting which exponentially increases the number of control flow paths. ** Huge, monolithic code units in which several aspects have been mixed together so that to change one aspect, changes have to be implemented at several points. ** Identification of unnecessary multi- threading. Multi-threading is an extremely large error source. The run-time behavior of multi-threading code is hard to comprehend meaning the cost and effort required for extensions or maintenance to it is correspondingly high. Thus, as a general rule, unnecessary multi-threading should be avoided. * Identification of insufficient exception handling. If there are too few try- catch blocks in the code or if nothing is executed in the catch function, the consequences, if program errors arise, can be serious. * Identification of which sections of source code have been altered since the last software test, i.e. where tests must be performed and where not. This information enables software tests to be planned more intelligently: new functionality can be tested more intensively or resources saved. * Knowledge of how much cost and effort will be required for the development or extension of a particular software module: ** When extending existing software modules, a recommendation for action could be to undertake code refactoring. ** Any newly developed functionality can be analyzed to ascertain whether a target/performance analysis has been performed for the costs and if so why. Were the causes of the deviations from the plan identified, can measures be implemented to increase accuracy in future planning. * By tracing which developer (team) produced which source code and examining the software created over a sustained period, any deficiencies can be identified as either one-off slips in quality, evidence of a need for improved employee qualification or whether the software development process requires further optimization. Finally the analysis data model of the KPI driven code analysis provides IT project managers, at a very early stage, with a comprehensive overview of the status of the software produced, the skills and effort of the employees as well as the maturity of the software development process.

In contrast to \\"everyday\\" statistics, to not engender bias or unduly draw conclusions, forensic statisticians report likelihoods as likelihood ratios (LR). This ratio of probabilities is then used by juries or judges to draw inferences or conclusions and decide legal matters. Jurors and judges rely on the strength of a DNA match, given by statistics, to make conclusions and determine guilt or innocence in legal matters. In forensic science, the DNA evidence received for DNA profiling often contains a mixture of more than one person's DNA. DNA profiles are generated using a set procedure, however, the interpretation of a DNA profile becomes more complicated when the sample contains a mixture of DNA. Regardless of the number of contributors to the forensic sample, statistics and probabilities must be used to provide weight to the evidence and to describe what the results of the DNA evidence mean. In a single-source DNA profile, the statistic used is termed a random match probability (RMP). RMPs can also be used in certain situations to describe the results of the interpretation of a DNA mixture. Other statistical tools to describe DNA mixture profiles include likelihood ratios (LR) and combined probability of inclusion (CPI), also known as random man not excluded (RMNE). Computer programs have been implemented with forensic DNA statistics for assessing the biological relationships between two or more people. Forensic science uses several approaches for DNA statistics with computer programs such as; match probability, exclusion probability, likelihood ratios, Bayesian approaches, and paternity and kinship testing. Although the precise origin of this term remains unclear, it is apparent that the term was used in the 1980s and 1990s. Among the first forensic statistics conferences were two held in 1991 and 1993.Aitken C. G. G., Taroni F. (2004) Statistics and the Evaluation of Evidence for Forensic Scientists, John Wiley and Sons.  Random Match Probability  Random match probabilities (RMP) are used to estimate and express the rarity of a DNA profile. RMP can be defined as the probability that someone else in the population, chosen at random, would have the same genotype as the genotype of the contributor of the forensic evidence. RMP is calculated using the genotype frequencies at all the loci, or how common or rare the alleles of a genotype are. The genotype frequencies are multiplied across all loci, using the product rule, to calculate the RMP. This statistic gives weight to the evidence either for or against a particular suspect being a contributor to the DNA mixture sample. RMP can only be used as a statistic to describe the DNA profile if it is from a single source or if the analyst is able to differentiate between the peaks on the electropherogram from the major and minor contributors of a mixture. Since the interpretation of DNA mixtures with more than two contributors is very difficult for analysts to do without computer software, RMP becomes difficult to calculate with a mixture of more than two people. If the major and minor contributor peaks can not be differentiated, there are other statistical methods that may be used. If the DNA mixture contains a ratio of 4:1 of major to minor contributors, a modified random match probability (mRMP) may be able to be used as a statistical tool. For calculation of mRMP, the analyst must first deduce a major and minor contributor and their genotypes based on the peak heights given in the electropherogram. Computer software is often used in labs conducting DNA analysis in order to more accurately calculate the mRMP, since calculations for each of the most probable genotypes at each locus become tedious and inefficient for the analyst to do by hand.  Likelihood Ratio  Sometimes it can be very difficult to determine the number of contributors in a DNA mixture. If the peaks are easily distinguished and the number of contributors is able to be determined, a likelihood ratio (LR) is used. LRs consider probabilities of events happening and rely on alternative pairs of hypotheses against which the evidence is assessed. These alternative pairs of hypotheses in forensic cases are the prosecutor's hypothesis and the defense hypothesis. In forensic biology cases, the hypotheses often state that the DNA came from a particular person or the DNA came from an unknown person. For example, the prosecution may hypothesize the DNA sample contains DNA from the victim and the suspect, while the defense may hypothesize that the sample contains DNA from the victim and an unknown person. The probabilities of the hypotheses are expressed as a ratio, with the prosecutor's hypothesis being in the numerator. The ratio then expresses the likelihood of both of the events in relation to each other. For the hypotheses where the mixture contains the suspect, the probability is 1, because one can distinguish the peaks and easily tell if the suspect can be excluded as a contributor at each locus based on his/her genotype. The probability of 1 assumes the suspect can not be excluded as a contributor. To determine the probabilities of the unknowns, all genotype possibilities must be determined for that locus. Once the calculation of the likelihood ratio is made, the number calculated is turned into a statement to provide meaning to the statistic. For the previous example, if the LR calculated is x, then the LR means that the probability of the evidence is x times more likely if the sample contains the victim and the suspect than if it contains the victim and an unknown person. Likelihood ratio can also be defined as 1/RMP.  Combined Probability of Inclusion  Combined probability of inclusion (CPI) is a common statistic used when the analyst can not differentiate between the peaks from a major and minor contributor to a sample and the number of contributors can not be determined. CPI is also commonly known as random man not excluded (RMNE). This statistical calculation is done by adding all the frequencies of observed alleles and then squaring the value, which yields the value for probability of inclusion (PI). These values are then multiplied across all loci, resulting in the value for CPI. The value is squared so that all the possible combinations of genotypes are included in the calculation. Once the calculation is done, a statement is made about the meaning of this calculation and what it means. For example, if the CPI calculated is 0.5, this means that the probability of someone chosen at random in the population not being excluded as a contributor to the DNA mixture is 0.5. CPI relates to the evidence (the DNA mixture) and it is not dependent on the profile of any suspect. Therefore, CPI is a statistical tool that can be used to provide weight or strength to evidence when no other information about the crime is known. This is advantageous in situations where the genotypes in the DNA mixture can not be distinguished from one another. However, this statistic is not very discriminating and is not as powerful of a tool as likelihood ratios and random match probabilities can be when some information about the DNA mixture, such as the number of contributors or the genotypes of each contributor, can be distinguished. Another limitation to CPI is that it is not usable as a tool for the interpretation of a DNA mixture.  Blood Stains  Blood stains are an important part of forensic statistics, as the analysis of blood drop collisions may help to picture the event that had previously gone on. Commonly blood stains are an elliptical shape, because of this blood stains are usually easy to determine the blood droplets angle through the formula “α = arcsin d/a”. In this formula 'a' and 'd' are simply estimations of the axis of the ellipse. From these calculations, a visualization of the event causing the stains is able to be drawn, and alongside further information such as the velocity of the entity that caused such stains.

It was formed in February 1987 by amalgamating 3 bodies: Labour Officers (Central Pool), Central Industrial Relations Machinery and Welfare Organisation of the Ministry of Labour. Its main roles are to implement labour and welfare laws, and intervene in disputes with the goal of preventing strike action. Indian labour laws are piecemeal at best, with some sectors over-regulated and some under-regulated. This would seem to be an attempt at balance, or at least an attempt to free up over- regulation.

The film is a summary of 33 hours of interviews that Morris conducted with Rumsfeld over eleven separate sessions during visits to Newton, Massachusetts. The film was released on April 4, 2014, by Radius-TWC and is dedicated to the memory of Roger Ebert. Synopsis The major portion of the film is spent addressing excerpts from the countless memos, nicknamed 'Yellow Perils' by his first Pentagon staff and 'Snowflakes' by the second, that Rumsfeld wrote during his time as a congressman and advisor to four different presidents, twice as United States Secretary of Defense. It also focuses on a response Rumsfeld gave to a question at a U.S. Department of Defense news briefing on February 12, 2002 about the lack of evidence linking the government of Iraq with the supply of weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups. The content of the memos are varied, covering everything from the aftermath of Watergate, to the torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, to the definition of the word \\"terrorism\\". Morris returns to the motif of snowflakes swirling within a globe throughout the documentary as he discusses the memos with Rumsfeld, the contents of which the Defense Secretary allowed him limited access while preparing the film, and several of which Rumsfeld agrees to read aloud on camera. At the beginning of the documentary, Rumsfeld argues that a major purpose of the Department of Defense is to evaluate \\"unknown knowns,\\" or \\"the things you think you know, that it turns out you did not,\\" to anticipate hostile actions before they take place. Illustrating his point, Rumsfeld suggests that the failure of the United States to anticipate the attack on Pearl Harbor was a failure of imagination. Rumsfeld during a Pentagon news briefing. As the interviews proceed, the director attempts to present several contradictions of fact and past statements. Rumsfeld does not always directly acknowledge, or engage in deeper discourse, and at times deflects the points raised — according to various editorials. Though, when the director asks him about lessons he learnt from the Vietnam War, for example, Rumsfeld straightforwardly states: \\"Some things work out, some things don’t; that didn’t.\\" Rumsfeld also expresses good-natured surprise at the recognition of a list of successful torture techniques — including hooding, stress positions, and nudity — that he personally approved for use on Guantánamo detainees, stating, \\"Good grief! That’s a pile of stuff!\\" In follow up, Morris questions him about the so-called \\"Torture Memos\\" describing enhanced interrogation techniques. When Rumsfeld indicates that he never read them, Morris responds in disbelief, \\"Really?\\" When asked if the Iraq War was a mistake, Rumsfeld replies, \\"I guess time will tell.\\" In the penultimate scene, Morris questions him again about \\"unknown knowns,\\" and the definition given by Rumsfeld has inverted, a discongruence the director is quick to point out, and which Rumsfeld acknowledges: \\"unknown knowns\\" are \\"things that you know, that you don't know you know.\\" As the documentary closes, Morris asks Rumsfeld why he agreed to the interviews. Rumsfeld responds, \\"That is a vicious question. I'll be darned if I know.\\" Cast * Donald Rumsfeld as (interviewee) himself * Errol Morris as (interviewer, voice) himself * Kenn Medeiros as younger Donald Rumsfeld / Secret Service Release The Unknown Known was screened in the main competition section at the 70th Venice International Film Festival, and premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 29, 2013. =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes the documentary has an approval rating of 82% based on 105 reviews with an average rating of 6.81/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Viewers hoping to see Donald Rumsfeld admit making mistakes in public office may find The Unknown Known frustrating – but no less fascinating.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". David Denby of The New Yorker wrote, \\"If Morris doesn’t quite nail Rumsfeld, his questions lead the Secretary to nail himself. You watch him obfuscate, fudge the issue of torture, smirk about George H. W. Bush (whom he doesn’t like), and offer dull commonplaces when impassioned clarity is called for.\\" Mary Corliss of Time wrote, \\"Morris's movie is a cat-and-mouse game, and Rumsfeld is the cat, virtually licking his chops as he toys with, and then devours, another rival.\\" Colin Colvert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune wrote, \\"Morris is admirably evenhanded, never demonizing his subject, but giving him enough rope to hang himself. Rumsfeld, cool and bemused, refuses to knot the noose.\\" =Comparisons to The Fog of War= Reviews have compared the film to Morris's Academy Award-winning predecessor, The Fog of War, a similar interview of Robert McNamara, the longest serving U.S. Secretary of Defense. Several reviews of the documentary compare it to Morris's Academy Award-winning predecessor, The Fog of War, with the follow-up being described as a \\"spiritual sequel\\". The earlier documentary is about Robert McNamara, the longest serving U.S. Secretary of Defense, with Rumsfeld being the second. Both are film interviews of former Defense Secretary octogenarians who were dismissed prematurely from their posts, and who discuss their roles as the voice of some of the most unpopular wars in recent American history – for McNamara, Vietnam and for Rumsfeld, Iraq. At one point, Morris asks Rumsfeld, \\"Have you seen The Fog of War? What do you think about that?\\" to which Rumsfeld responds, \\"I hate it. That man had nothing to apologize for.\\" Morris himself has been resistant to comparisons, stating \\"You can’t call this ‘The Fog of War 2.’ I can’t imagine two individuals more unalike.\\" See also * Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse * Electoral history of Donald Rumsfeld * Enhanced interrogation techniques * Epistemic modal logic * Foreign policy of the George W.

This pearlfish lives inside the coelom of sea cucumbers such as Bohadschia argus, Thelenota ananas , and Stichopus chloronotus. It is native to tropical and subtropical parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Description Encheliophis homei is a slender fish that grows to a maximum length of . The body is transparent and melanophores and silvery patches are found on the abdomen, which contains a large swim bladder. It has a free and moveable upper jaw, small conical teeth, large eyes, and 116 to 128 vertebrae. The elongated dorsal fin has 33 to 38 soft rays and the anal fin 53 to 61. A pair of pectoral fins but no pelvic fins are present. Biology As an adult, E. homei lives inside the body cavity of a sea cucumber. It enters and leaves the coelom through the anus, sometimes continues into the respiratory tree, and in one instance was found in the gut. Not much is known about the lifecycle of the fish, but it has a planktonic larval stage. Later, this larva settles on the seabed and searches for a sea cucumber host, in which it undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile fish. Some competition among Encheliophis homei and another closely related fish Carapus boraborensis occurs for \\"ownership\\" of the host sea cucumber, and juveniles of E. homei have been found among the stomach contents of C. boraborensis. Aggression usually takes the form of tail biting. After being in open water, the fish does not necessarily return to the original host, and shows no preference as to which species of sea cucumber it uses as a host. Before entering, it patrols several times along the outside surface of the sea cucumber, \\"sniffing\\" at it. It then pecks or taps with its snout around the area of the anus before entering the host, which it usually does head first, but sometimes the other way round. At one time, the silver pearlfish was thought to be parasitic on its sea cucumber host, but examination of its stomach contents has shown that amphipods, shrimp, and small fishes are included in its diet, which shows it must exit its host, probably at night, to forage. Distribution The silver pearlfish is native to the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from the Red Sea and the East African coast to the Society Islands, Taiwan, and northern and eastern Australia, probably southwards as far as Tasmania. It occurs to depths of . Etymology The specific names honours the English surgeon and naturalist Everard Home (1756-1832) who collected along the coasts of Australia and China and who may have collected the type of this species.

It was screened in the main competition section at the 70th Venice International Film Festival. Elena Cotta won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. Plot During hot and sunny Sunday afternoon in Palermo, two women, Rosa and Clara, who have come to celebrate a friend's wedding, get lost in the streets of the city and end up in tiny alley: via Castellana Bandiera (a road that actually exists in the area of Mount Pellegrino). At the same moment another car, driven by Samira and with the Calafiore family crammed inside, arrives in the opposite direction and enters the same street. Neither Rosa nor Samira, an old and stubborn woman driving her car, intend to give way to each other. Locked in their cars, the two women face off in a silent duel that takes place in the intimate violence of the looks. An all-female challenge punctuated by the refusal to drink, eat and sleep, more stubborn than the Palermo sun and more stubborn than the ferocity of the men around them. Samira's family decides to make a bet with all the families they know to see which of the two women is the most stubborn, betting everything on Samira. Despite Clara's attempts to make Rosa desist and Samira's grandson to get her grandmother home, the duel doesn't stop as none of the two cars backs away. Rosa's stubbornness is motivated by a sense of frustration towards her mother and a city, Palermo, in which she has never felt at home, while Samira, almost turned to stone by years of mistreatment and by the death of her daughter, vents his pain in this duel. The next morning, awakened from sleep, Rosa finds Samira still in the car with her hands on the wheel. It would seem that the old woman was evidently more stubborn than her, but paying a heavy price: Samira has, in fact, died at the wheel. As the Calafiore family gathers around the deceased woman, Rosa and Clara retreat, leaving the alley.

They form a 12–15 nm surface coat and were first isolated from Trypanosoma brucei in 1975 by George Cross. VSG allows the trypanosomatid parasites to evade the mammalian host's immune system by extensive antigenic variation. VSG has no prescribed biochemical activity. The Trypanosoma brucei cell membrane is densely packed with VSG dimers, which make up ~90% of its cell surface protein, and which allows for the parasite to evade the immune system and establish chronic infection. The parasite has a large cellular repertoire of antigenically distinct VSGs (~1500 complete and partial (pseudogenes)) located in telomeric and subtelomeric arrays (on megabase chromosomes or minichromosomes). VSGs are expressed from a bloodstream expression site (BES, ES) in a polycistron by RNA polymerase I (recruited to a ribosomal-type promoter) with other ES-associated genes (ESAGs), of which transferrin receptor (Tfr: ESAG6, ESAG7) is one. Only one VSG gene is expressed at a time, as only one of the ~15 ES are active in a cell. VSG expression is 'switched' by homologous recombination of a silent basic copy gene from an array (directed by homology) into the active telomerically-located expression site. Mosaic VSG genes can be created by homologous recombination of a partial VSG gene from an array. This partial gene may replace any portion of the residing VSG gene, creating a new mosaic VSG.  In Trypanosoma brucei  In Trypanosoma brucei, the cell surface is covered by a dense coat of ~5 x 106 VSG dimers, ~90% of all cell surface protein. It also makes up ~10% of total cell protein. The properties of the VSG coat that enable immune evasion are: *Shielding – the dense nature of the VSG coat (VSG proteins pack shoulder-to- shoulder) prevents the immune system of the mammalian host from accessing the plasma membrane or any other parasitic invariant surface epitopes (such as ion channels, transporters, receptors etc.). The coat is uniform, made up of millions of copies of the same molecule; therefore, VSG is the only part of the trypanosome that the immune system can recognize. *Periodic antigenic variation – the VSG coat undergoes frequent stochastic genetic modification—'switching'—allowing variants expressing a new VSG coat to escape the specific immune response raised against the previous coat. This antigenic variation creates cyclical waves of parasitemia characteristic of Human African Trypanosomiasis. *Antigen 'cleaning' and VSG recycling—VSG is efficiently recycled through the trypanosome flagellar pocket, allowing antibodies to be 'cleaned' from VSG before re-incorporation back into the cellular membrane. Importantly, VSGs recognized and bound by antibodies are selectively pushed toward the flagellar pocket at a quicker rate than unidentified VSG; in this scenario, the antibody acts as a 'sail', which quickens the process of VSG being brought to the area of recycling. The VSGs from T. brucei are attached to the plasma membrane via a covalent attachment to two glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (one per monomer), which directs its forward-trafficking from the ER to the flagellar pocket for incorporation into the membrane, as predicted by the GPI valence hypothesis. VSGs are replaced by an equally dense coat of procyclins when the parasite differentiates into the procyclic form in the tsetse fly midgut. There is a very fast inhibition of VSG gene transcription which occurs as soon as the temperature is lowered. = Expression = The source of VSG variability during infection is a large 'archive' of VSG genes present in the T. brucei genome. Some of these are full-length, intact genes; others are pseudogenes (typically with frameshift mutations, premature stop codons, or fragmentation). Expression of an antigenically different VSG can occur by simply switching to a different full-length VSG gene by Expression Site switching (switching which ES is active). In addition, chimeric or 'mosaic' VSG genes can be generated by combining segments from more than one silent VSG gene. The formation of mosaic VSGs allows the (partial) expression of pseudogene VSGs, which can constitute the major portion of the VSG archive, and can contribute directly to antigenic variation, vastly increasing the trypanosome's capacity for immune evasion and posing a major problem for vaccine development. VSG genes can be kept silent and switched on at any given time. The expressed VSG is always located in an Expression Site (ES), which are specialised expression loci found at the telomeres of some of the large and intermediate chromosomes. Each ES is a polycistronic unit, containing a number of Expression Site-Associated Genes (ESAGs) all expressed along with the active VSG. While multiple ES exist, only a single one is ever active at one time. A number of mechanisms appear to be involved in this process, but the exact nature of the silencing is still unclear. The expressed VSG can be switched either by activating a different expression site (and thus changing to express the VSG in that site), or by changing the VSG gene in the active site to a different variant. The genome contains many copies of VSG genes, both on minichromosomes and in repeated sections in the interior of the chromosomes. These are generally silent, typically with omitted sections or premature stop codons, but are important in the evolution of new VSG genes. It is estimated up to 10% of the T.brucei genome may be made up of VSG genes or pseudogenes. Any of these genes can be moved into the active site by recombination for expression. Again, the exact mechanisms that control this are unclear, but the process seems to rely on DNA repair machinery and a process of homologous recombination. The bloodstream expression site (BES), or telomeric expression site, is used for exchanging variant surface glycoproteins when in host's blood stream to escape the complement system. BESs are polymorphic in size and structure but reveal a surprisingly conserved architecture in the context of extensive recombination. Very small BESs do exist and many functioning BESs do not contain the full complement of expression site associated genes (ESAGs). There is a collection of an estimated 20-30 sites, each being active at a time. Active VSG expression sites are depleted of nucleosomes. The gene repertoires in T. brucei have diverged to become strain-specific. The variant surface glycoprotein genes of T. brucei have been classified into two groups depending upon whether or not duplication of the genes is observed when they are expressed. Mechanisms of VSG switching in T. brucei: A. Structure of the expression site including the expression site associated genes (ESAG), 70 base pair repeat up-stream sequence, expressed VSG gene, and the telomere B. Mechanism of array VSG conversion: A silent VSG is copied from a subtelomeric VSG array into an ES, where it replaces the active VSG. C. Telomeric VSG conversion: A telomeric VSG (including 70 bp repeat sequence upstream and telomere downstream) replaces the active VSG in the ES D. Segmental VSG conversion: Sequence is copied from multiple inactive VSG genes and combined into a novel mosaic VSG that occupies the ES E. Transcriptional VSG switching: A non-recombination based mechanism that activates a new (previously silent) ES, while inactivating the previously active ES. = Secretory trafficking = Trypanosoma have a simple, polarized membrane transport system consisting of a single ER, lysosome, and Golgi apparatus. VSG is first transcribed as a polycistron and then undergoes trypanosomatid-specific poly-adenylation and trans-splicing directed by polypyrimidine tracts. Because there is no transcriptional control, the VSG 3'UTR is important for its RNA stability (most importantly, the 8mer and 14mer). VSG is then transcribed on membrane-bound polysomes, and the appearance of the N-terminal signal sequence directs VSG to the ER. VSG is thereby co-translationally transported into the ER lumen, rapidly N-glycosylated (on asn-x-ser/thr sites) and GPI anchored at the ω site by a transamination reaction (removing of the C-term hydrophobic 17 or 23 aa GPI anchoring sequence). The ω site is always Ser (usually in 17 aa signal sequence peptides), Asp (usually in 23 aa signal sequence peptides), or Asn. Also, the number of N-glycosylation sites per VSG may vary (usually 1-3 N-glycans). VSG MITat.1.5 is glycosylated at all three potential N-glycosylation sites. VSG then undergoes the calreticulin/calnexin folding cycle (calnexin is absent in Trypanosoma brucei), where it is transiently monoglucosylated and deglucosylated, and interacts with various ER chaperone proteins, such as BiP, in order to fold correctly. VSG efficiently folds and dimerizes (suggesting intrinsically favorable folding) and is transported through the Golgi to the flagellar pocket for incorporation into the cell membrane. Importantly, following incorporation into the cellular membrane, VSG may later be recycled through the flagellar pocket and sorted back to the cell surface. VSG is not turned over by lysosomal or proteasomal canonical degradation pathways, but is instead lost from the cell by specific cleavage of its GPI anchor by GPI-specific PLC. = Structure = VSG genes are hugely variable at the sequence (primary) level, but variants are thought to have strongly conserved structural (tertiary) features, based on two determined 3-dimensional structures and conservation of 2-dimensional sequence motifs (descending and ascending alpha-helices that make up the dimerization interface), allowing them to perform a similar shielding function. VSGs are made up of N terminal domain of around 300-350 amino acids with low sequence homology (13-30% identity), and a more conserved C terminal domain of ~100 amino acids . N-terminal domains are grouped into classes A-C depending on their cysteine patterns. C-term domains are grouped by sequence homology into classes I-III, with apparently no restriction on which N-term classes they can pair with to form a full VSG. To dimerize, VSG N-terminal domains form a bundle of four alpha helices directed by hydrophobic interactions, around which hang smaller structural features (five smaller helices and three beta- sheets). VSG is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor—a noncovalent linkage from the C-terminus which directs its forward trafficking from the ER to the membrane. This GPI anchor is specifically cleaved by GPI Phospholipase C, cleaving the membrane-form VSG, and allowing VSG protein and portion of the GPI anchor to be lost into the extracellular milieu as soluble VSG (sVSG, which is can be recognized as Cross-Reacting Determinant, or CRD), while retaining the two 1,2-dimyristolglycerol chains in the membrane. Structure of one of the N-terminal VSG variants. VSG genes have a largely conserved N-terminal secondary and tertiary structure (composed of two alpha-helices which form the dimerization interface, and which couple into a four helix bundle), while still allowing for variable primary sequence. This variable primary sequence allows for VSG to be antigenically distinct from one another, the crux to antigenic variation. = Antigenic variation = VSG is highly immunogenic, and an immune response raised against a specific VSG coat will rapidly kill trypanosomes expressing this variant. Antibody-mediated trypanosome killing can also be observed in vitro by a complement-mediated lysis assay. However, with each cell division there is a possibility that one or both of the progeny will switch expression to change the VSG that is being expressed. The frequency of VSG switching has been measured to be approximately 0.1% per division, though switching rates do differ in culture vs. in vivo. As T. brucei populations can peak at a size of 1011 within a host this rapid rate of switching ensures that the parasite population is constantly diverse. A diverse range of coats expressed by the trypanosome population means that the immune system is always one step behind: it takes several days for an immune response against a given VSG to develop, giving the population time to diversify as individuals undergo further switching events. Reiteration of this process prevents extinction of the infecting trypanosome population, allowing chronic persistence of parasites in the host, enhancing opportunities for transmission. The clinical effect of this cycle is successive 'waves' of parasitaemia (trypanosomes in the blood).  In other trypanosomes  Variable surface glycoproteins are also found in other Trypanosoma species, In Trypanosoma equiperdum, a parasite causing the covering sickness in horses, These proteins allow the parasite to efficiently evade the host animal's immune system. These VSGs allow the organism to constantly manipulate and change the surface structure of its proteins, which means it is constantly being presented to the immune system as a new foreign organism and this prevents the body from mounting a large enough immune response to eradicate the disease. In this sense, Trypanosoma equiperdum is a very efficient organism; it may infect fewer species than other diseases, but it infects and survives very efficiently within its specified hosts. The VSG proteins in T. equiperdum are also phosphorylated. A VSG gene from Trypanosoma evansi, a parasite that causes a form of surra in animals, has been cloned in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein is immunoreactive with all the sera combinations. The animals immunized with whole cell lysate or recombinant protein show similar antibody reactions in ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and CATT (card agglutination test for Trypanosomiasis). The variable surface glycoprotein RoTat 1.2 PCR can be used as a specific diagnostic tool for the detection of T. evansi infections. The smallest VSG protein (40 kDa in size) to date (1996) has been found in Trypanosoma vivax, which bears little carbohydrate. In Trypanosoma congolense, in vitro analyses of the incorporated sugars after hydrolysis of the glycoprotein showed that glucosamine and mannose are utilized in the biosynthesis of the carbohydrate moiety directly whereas galactose was converted possibly to other intermediates before being incorporated into the antigen. The unglycosylated VSG with a molecular weight of 47 kDa had completely lost its size heterogeneity.

The property lies between the two unincorporated communities of Shacklefords and King and Queen Court House, Virginia. Dated (by tree-rings) to 1793, the plantation's surviving central residence is a two-story, five bay, symmetrical frame house with a gambrel roof, brick foundation and brick end-walls—the latter featuring Flemish bond and internal (rather than expressed) chimneys. Located between two adjacent plantations, the earliest owners of the property were William Meredith and subsequently Richard Dixon, of whom little is known. The plantation and home are named after Richard Dixon, and he is credited with constructing the surviving residence. At the time of its successful nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2005, Dixon was one of eight surviving gambrel- roof residences from the eighteenth and early nineteenth century in King and Queen County, Virginia. Description According to its NRHP nomination, the home features its original interior wood paneling, and noteworthy interior stairway detailing—the latter with sculptural railings, column and urn balusters (two per tread) and newel posts with molded caps and mortise and tenon construction. Landside and waterside elevations are identical with double doors centered on each exterior elevation, flanked by two \\"nine-over- nine\\" sash windows and four horizontal basement windows.

In 1934, a pen and ink drawing of Dixon (see infobox, this article) was made by Elsie, J. Mistie for the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project (1932–1937). The drawing documented Dixon before the later additions of hyphen-connected outbuildings. Site Records indicate the original site featured out-buildings including a kitchen, smokehouse, barn, wharf, dairy and cemetery. Research indicates a nearby house and kitchen that predate the existing house. Originally nearly 440 acres and now roughly 20 acres, the property at the time of its NRHP nomination featured four non-original outbuildings. The number has since changed with Dixon's subsequent restoration and renovation. 2000–2010 restoration The Fry- Jefferson map of the royal colony of Virginia (1752). Beginning in 2000, the owner of Dixon removed the flanking 1950s Colonial Revival wings, replacing them with more modern additions, including a master wing, screened porch and guest wing. A completely modern workshop/garage dependency (outbuilding) was constructed nearby, in a compatible 18th century architectural style. During the restoration of the primary wing, period incorrect slate roofing was replaced with the correct wood shingles (fish scale pattern), nails were forged where necessary and replacement siding was replicated after original attic planking. Interior furnishings now include a portrait of George Washington by Thomas Sully, mid-eighteenth century Norfolk chair, period correct knee-hole bureau and 18th century Fry Jefferson Map of Virginia.
