She was renamed Ro-46 on 5 February 1943 and was attached provisionally to the Maizuru Naval District that day. She was launched on 23 May 1943 and was completed and commissioned on 19 February 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-43 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District. She called at Tokuyama to refuel from 28 to 29 March 1944. During a workup cruise, she was involved in an underwater collision with the submarine in the Iyo-nada in the Seto Inland Sea off Minase Light at 21:45 on 2 April 1944, suffering damage to her conning tower. =First war patrol= On 23 June 1944, Ro-46 was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet, and she departed Kure, Japan, to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Mariana Islands off Saipan, where the Battle of Saipan had been raging since 15 June. U.S. forces attacked and damaged her on 3 July 1944, forcing her to return to Kure on 8 July 1944 for repairs. =Second war patrol= With her repairs complete, Ro-46 set out from Kure on 19 September 1944 to begin her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area southwest of Palau. She sighted a United States Navy aircraft carrier on 28 September 1944, but was too far away to attack. She sighted another aircraft carrier on 1 October 1944, but again did not attack. On 2 October 1944, Ro-46 received orders to join the submarine in a reconnaissance of the American fleet anchorage at Ulithi Atoll, with Ro-46 approaching the atoll from the west while I-177 approached it from the east. The information they gathered was intended to support the first kaiten suicide attack torpedo operation against the anchorage. Ro-46 made her periscope reconnaissance of the anchorage on 7 October, reporting the aircraft carrier , two heavy cruisers, and their escorts there. She returned to Kure on 14 October 1944. =Third war patrol= On 13 October 1944, the day before Ro-46‚Ä≤s arrival at Kure, the Combined Fleet activated Operation Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1 for the defense of the Philippine Islands. The Philippines campaign and the Battle of Leyte began with the U.S. landings on Leyte on 20 October 1944, and that day Ro-46 got back underway from Kure for her third war patrol, ordered to operate as part of Submarine Group B and assigned a patrol area in the Philippine Sea east of the Philippines. The Japanese naval reaction to the invasion of Leyte resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23‚Äì26 October 1944. Ro-46 saw no action during the battle, and on 7 November 1944 the 6th Fleet ordered all submarines in the Philippines area to return to Japan. On 13 November 1944, during her voyage to Japan, Ro-46 rescued the pilot of an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa (\\"Peregrine Falcon\\"; Allied reporting name \\"Oscar\\") fighter shot down during combat over Manila. She arrived at Maizuru on 19 November 1944. =Fourth war patrol= On 8 January 1945, Ro-46 put to sea from Kure for her fourth war patrol, with a patrol area in the South China Sea west of Luzon. U.S. forces entered Lingayen Gulf and U.S. forces began their invasion of Luzon on 9 January 1945. On 29 January 1945, Ro-46 torpedoed the attack transport at ; although Cavalier survived, she had to be towed to Leyte. reported sinking a fleet oiler from a convoy at 01:13 on 30 January 1945, then departed the area. On 2 or 4 February 1945 (sources differ), the 6th Fleet ordered Ro-46 and the submarines , , and received orders to proceed to Takao, Formosa, unload their reserve torpedoes and deck gun ammunition there, and then head for Batulinao on the northern coast of Luzon to rescue Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service pilots stranded in Luzon's Aparri area and transport them to Takao. Ro-46 arrived at Takao on Formosa on 4 February 1945. At Takao, Ro-46‚Ä≤s orders were modified to require her to transport fuel and ammunition to the Japanese forces fighting on Luzon, rescue at least 40 pilots from Batulinao, then proceed directly to Sasebo, Japan. She departed Takao on 7 February 1945 and arrived at Batulinao just before midnight on 10 February. After unloading her cargo into Daihatsu-class landing craft operated by the Imperial Japanese Army, she embarked 46 pilots and got back underway the same night. She transported the pilots to Takao, which she reached on 12 February 1945. On 13 February 1945, Ro-46 departed Takao to return to Japan, ordered to conduct a reconnaissance of the Ryukyu Islands while en route. She arrived at Kure on 19 February 1945. =Fifth war patrol= Ro-46 got underway from Kure on 6 April 1945 for her fifth war patrol, assigned a patrol area northeast of Kitadait≈çjima, which lies in the southern Ryukyu Islands southeast of Okinawa, where the Battle of Okinawa had begun on 1 April 1945. On 17 April 1945, she transmitted a report to the 6th Fleet from a position northeast of Kitadait≈çjima. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= The circumstances of the loss of Ro-46 remain unknown. Some sources credit the U.S. Navy submarine with sinking her northeast of Wake Island on 18 April 1945, but Ro-46 was operating far from Wake Island and the Japanese submarine Sea Owl attacked was ‚Äî which survived the attack. It is possible that aircraft of U.S. Navy Composite Squadron 92 (VC-92) operating from the escort aircraft carrier sank Ro-46 at on 29 April 1945. On 2 May 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-46 to be presumed lost in the Okinawa area with all 86 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 June 1945.

Born in Philadelphia in 1906, she moved to New York to take nursing classes after graduating from high school. She completed her nursing training at Harlem Hospital School of Nursing in 1929 and worked for two years as a nurse before being promoted to the director of the educational and recreational programs at Harlem Hospital. After being fired for trying to unionize nurses in 1938, she became the director of the Upper Manhattan YWCA School for Practical Nurses, the first African-American to serve as director of a school of nursing in the state of New York. In 1944, John became a lecturer and consultant with the National Nursing Council for War Service, serving until the war ended, and was the last director of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses from 1946 until it dissolved in 1951. Her position at both organizations was to expand nursing opportunities for black women and integrate black nurses throughout the nation into the health care system. In 1949, John wrote a script Brown Women in White for production on WNBC, which led to a second career in radio and television. In 1952, she presented the The Homemaker's Club on station WWRL in New York. The following year, she became the first black radio personality to be invited as a member of the New York chapter of the Association of Women in Radio and Television. She campaigned successfully for the organization meetings to be held in unsegregated facilities. In 1957, she received the McCall's Golden Mike Award for her show What's Right with Teenagers and in 1959 she became the director of women's programming at WWRL. Over her 25 year career at the radio station, she wrote and produced numerous programs giving household tips, health care advice, and providing community service information. In 1970, John began appearing on television shows at WPIX-TV. She interviewed prominent black figures on her shows Black Pride and Positively Black. John worked up to her death in 1986 and is remembered mainly for her pioneering role in radio. Early life and education Alma Vessells was born on September 27, 1906 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Hattie (n√©e Taylor) and Joseph Vessells. She came from a family of nine siblings, which struggled with poverty. Her mother died when she was twelve and Vessells, as the oldest child, helped raise her younger siblings. Her father was a carpenter and Vessells worked as a domestic and vegetable peeler to earn money. The family read The Negro World, published by Marcus Garvey, which strongly impacted her work ethic and ethnic pride. After graduating from high school, she moved to New York City, to study nursing. She enrolled at the Harlem Hospital School of Nursing in 1926 and graduated in 1929. Career =Nursing (1929‚Äì1951)= After earning her license to practice, Vessells worked as a nurse at Harlem Hospital In 1930, she was hired as the director of the educational and recreational programs for them. While working there, she met Cornwall Lisley John, whom she would marry on October 1, 1937. Lisley was a barber from Saint Vincent in the British West Indies, who worked in New York. In October 1938, John tried to unionize the nurses to demand higher pay and better working conditions and was fired by the hospital. Though a petition to get her job back was presented to the Civil Service convention held in New York that year, John accepted a new post in 1938 as the director of Harlem's Upper Manhattan YWCA School for Practical Nurses. In taking the position, John became the first African-American woman to direct a school of practical nurses in New York State. John remained with the YWCA until 1944, when she left to work as a lecturer and consultant with the National Nursing Council for War Service. Working as an assistant to Estelle Massey Riddle, she helped to eliminate the nursing shortage by increasing the number of black nurses. Their goal was to establish training programs for black students and to provide instruction to nursing school administrators, directors, and public officials on how to increase enrollment. Riddle and John pointed out that segregated schools in the United States meant that many black students needed improvements to their basic education in order to complete nursing training, and encouraged schools to develop curricula that would provide for a well-rounded education. John, circa 1949 with women who integrated the North Carolina Nurses Association During this time, John returned to school, joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, and completed her Bachelor of Science in 1946 at New York University in education and public health nursing. At the end of the year, she was the first nurse elected to membership on the National Committee on Children and Youth, a group organized to advise legislators about issues effecting young people. Soon after her graduation, she became the executive secretary of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses. Her role as director was to remove barriers and racial policies which prohibited the advancement of black nurses. A second major part of her position was to assist with the transition of merging the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses into the American Nurses Association. She traveled around the South trying to smooth over concerns of white nurses about the merger, while trying to reassure black nurses that the merger could improve their professional status and open opportunities. To reach broader audiences and expand nursing opportunities, John began broadcasting programs on the radio. In 1949, she wrote a script Brown Women in White for production on WNBC, which led to a consultation with Margaret Cuthbert, an NBC programming executive, for other radio work. The show covered 40 years of the struggle for black women to work as nurses and was aired nationwide on 69 stations. She continued to work as a consultant for the National Nursing Council for War Service until the war ended, and served as the last director of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses until it dissolved in 1951. In 1950, John was appointed as a delegate to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's National Mobilization for Civil Rights. She was among the delegates chosen to speak directly with President Harry Truman about pressing needs of the black community and the need for civil rights legislation. The delegates stressed that the primary focus should be on the unrestricted right to vote by elimination of poll taxes and a federal anti-lynching law, but the administration chose to focus on fair employment practices legislation. At the end of her tenure with the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, John reported that prior to World War II, only 14 nursing schools throughout the country admitted black students. By 1950, nationally, 304 nursing schools allowed African-American students. She also noted that only five states still prohibited black nurses from joining associations, though there were still gaps in opportunity and pay nationwide. =Radio and television (1952‚Äì1978)= John (center) during an episode of the Homemaker's Club on WWRL featuring the work of the Joshua School of the AHRC New York City with Anna Collins (left) and Assistant Director, Rudolf P. Hormuth (right), 1950s In 1952, John began writing and presenting the The Homemaker's Club on the New York station WWRL. Initially the program was a 15-minute spot, but was soon expanded to a half-hour show in the station's drive to attract women listeners. The show mixed household tips with conversation by John and her guests, which focused on social issues and community affairs and ran nationwide five days per week. That same year, she and her husband began offering a concierge service, which they called the House of Service, for visitors to New York. Because of her extensive travel experience, she recognized the difficulty when traveling of making arrangements in an unknown city and their business helped travelers with informational requests, researching travel arrangements, setting reservations, and finding service providers for various needs. In 1953, John became the first black woman admitted to the New York chapter of the Association of Women in Radio and Television. She ran a successful campaign with Mary Dee Dudley, the first African American female disc jockey in the United States, for the association to adopt a policy that all of their meetings would be held in non- segregated facilities. Beginning in 1954, John produced the radio programs Alma John Talks to Teens and What's Right with Teenagers, the latter broadcasting three times a week. These shows encouraged black youth to complete their education and strive for career opportunities, inspiring many to dream of entering the broadcasting business. What's Right with Teenagers was produced and directed by teenagers, and John helped them write scripts, plan programs, schedule interviews, and taught them to use the recording technology. Working with their schools, she also offered career advice and helped many of the students find employment. In 1957, she was awarded the McCall's Golden Mike Award at the national convention of the Association of Women in Radio and Television held in San Francisco for her work on What's Right with Teenagers. She was the first black woman to receive the award. In 1959, she was promoted to director of women's programming for WWRL. John, (center) \\"Furs for Moppets\\" episode of the Homemaker's Club on WWRL with Regina Berry (left) and Valerie Libuti (right), 1950s Over her twenty-five year association with WWRL, she produced various syndicated series on household hints, like Alma John Shoppers' Guide, At Home With Alma John, Household Hints and Speak of Color, which featured advice on budgeting, credit, decorating, and nutrition. She produced a wide variety of shows including The World at Your Doorstep, an interview show featuring talks with foreign visitors and a program geared to senior citizens called Golden Agers. Other programs included public service projects such as information on health and civil rights issues, along with well-known guests like Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1960, she was honored by the National Urban League, and throughout her career received numerous awards and honors from various civic organizations. In 1970, she was approached by New York City television station WPIX to host a program about black issues and achievements. For two years she hosted Black Pride, before becoming the show's producer in 1972. The program ran twice each week and featured a wide variety of guests, including Coretta Scott King, Ella Fitzgerald, Edythe J. Gaines, Roberta Flack, Rosa Parks, and Pamela Strobel (aka Princess Pamela), among others. She also hosted the talk series Positively Black. Her last television production was a talk show, Like It Is, and was produced for WPIX in 1978. =Later career (1977‚Äì1986)= John hosted the Alma John Workshops and published a newsletter of the same name from 1979 to 1986. The workshops aimed to promote community uplift, education, and public health. They offered community members of all ages a place to share their creative works and organized events for participation, like visiting prisons, detention centers, or children's homes. In connection with the workshops, she traveled widely and spoke to various organizations and groups. Death and legacy John died on April 8, 1986, at Harlem Hospital after suffering a stroke the previous day. Her funeral was held at Saint Paul Baptist Church of Harlem on April 12 and on May 1, the United States House of Representatives paid tribute to her memory. She was remembered for her contributions in the fight for civil rights, nursing, and as a pioneer radio personality. She influenced the careers of numerous media communications professionals like Gary Byrd, Pablo Guzm√°n, David Lampel, and Gil Noble, among others. John's papers were willed to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City, which received them in 1990. She was one of the radio pioneers featured on the Smithsonian Productions documentary series Black Radio: Telling It Like It Was created by Jacqueline Gales Webb in 1996. The archival records of the program, including taped interviews with John are housed at the Indiana University Archives of African American Music and Culture in Bloomington.

Biography Ram√≥n √Ålvarez Palomo was born in Gij√≥n, on March 7, 1913, he had five brothers and his father was a member of the National Confederation of Labor (, CNT). He began working as a baker at the age of 12, after being educated at the rationalist school of Eleuterio Quintanilla. In 1928 he joined the CNT himself, where he met Segundo Blanco and Avelino Gonz√°lez Mallada. At the age of twenty, he was elected secretary of the Gij√≥n bakers section and, in July 1933, also general secretary of the CNT of Asturias, Le√≥n and Palencia. =Revolution= He was one of the Asturian leaders of the anarchist insurrection of January 1933 and was locked up in jail, where he met Buenaventura Durruti, Cipriano Mera and Isaac Puente. After receiving amnesty from Alejandro Lerroux in April 1934, he actively participated in the Asturian Revolution, becoming secretary of the Gij√≥n Revolutionary Committee (, CRX). When the revolt was crushed, he fled through the mountains until in March 1935 he managed to reach France, where he remained until he was granted amnesty after the victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 general election. When the coup d'√©tat took place on July 18, 1936, he became a member of the Gij√≥n War Committee, and later a fisheries councilor and representative of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (, FAI) in the Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le√≥n. After the fall of Asturias into the hands of the nationalist forces in 1937, he fled to Catalunya, where he acted as secretary of Segundo Blanco, the Minister of Education in the first Negr√≠n government. =Exile= At the end of the civil war he fled to France and settled in Paris, where his first wife, Carmen Cadavieco, died shortly after. When the Wehrmacht troops occupied Paris in 1940 he fled to Orleans and from there to Chartres, where in 1942 he managed to gather around 500 exiled CNT militants and maintained contact with the French Resistance. In 1945 he participated in the CNT Congress in Toulouse, where he restructured the Regional Committee of Asturias in exile. He also lead the possibilist section (in favor of collaborating with the governments of the Spanish Republican government in exile) to split from the impossibilist sector headed by Germinal Esgleas Jaume and Federica Montseny. Finally the split was consummated and he became Secretary General of the possibilist CNT, until the 1st Regional Plenary held in Toulouse in December 1947. In 1949 he moved back to Paris. At the end of the 1960s, together with UGT leaders, he founded the Unified Workers' Solidarity Fund to help imprisoned or fired workers. =Return to Asturias= He returned to Asturias for the first time in 1972 and, definitively, in 1976. Once returned, he participated in the different congresses of the CNT and in 1978 he was elected regional secretary for Asturias, also directing the magazine Acci√≥n Libertaria until 1994. During the 5th congress of the union he defended the participation of the CNT in collective bargaining and union elections in works councils, opposing national leaders such as Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a R√∫a. These discrepancies led him to break with the CNT and approach the General Confederation of Labor (, CGT), of which he was one of the founders in 1989.

Located on the left bank of the Danube, it was originally a monastery, built on the site of an earlier church with the same name. Conceived as a fortress, it was built by workers brought from Transylvania. Its ktitors were the BrƒÉila merchants Die and »òerbu, as well as the local trader Constantin Teodor. From the beginning, it was placed under the protection of the Athonite Vatopedi Monastery. While visiting in 1653, Paul of Aleppo noted its presence.DrƒÉgoi and Marinescu, pp. 8-9 Over the ensuing two centuries, wars and robbers led to the church‚Äôs deterioration, such that by 1885, Bishop Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu, who had earlier served in Gala»õi, wrote: ‚ÄúToday, the Precista Monastery has completely lost the appearance of a fortress. It has neither the surrounding wall, nor the magnificent bell tower, nor the three spires described by Paul of Aleppo, but only two. The Turks burned and looted it many times and turned it into a customs office, where they deposited the products they gathered from around the country, before taking them to Constantinople.‚Äù The church owes its current appearance to the thorough consolidation and renovation work that took place in 1954‚Äì1957. The communist regime converted the church into a museum of feudal history and art during 1970, opening the following year. This closed in 1990, after the Romanian Revolution. At that point, the building became a parish church, and was rededicated in 1994. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

Her research considers the development of novel detectors as part of the search for dark matter. In 2016 she was honoured with the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for her work on the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.  Early life and education  Monroe is from Chicago. She studied physics at Columbia University, where she completed a bachelor's degree in astrophysics in 1999. After graduating she joined the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) as an engineering physicist int he neutrino factory. In the neutrino factory Monroe worked on muon beam cooling. After one year at Fermilab, Monroe returned to Columbia University, where she joined the Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE) neutrino experiment and completed a doctorate under the supervision of Michael Shaevitz. She was part of the team who confirmed that there were three types of neutrinos, and that the Standard Model was still in effect.  Research and career  After earning her doctorate Monroe was made Pappalardo Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and was promoted to Assistant Professor soon after. At MIT, Monroe joined the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory where she looked for exotic particles in solar neutrino oscillations. After completing her postdoctoral research, Monroe joined the MiniCLEAN and Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber (DMTPC) experiments to detect dark matter particle interactions. Whilst at MIT she taught physics to Dianna Cowern. In 2011 Monroe moved to the United Kingdom, where she joined Royal Holloway, University of London. Here she founded the Dark Matter research group, in which she specialises in the direct detection of dark matter. Direct detection means that experiments record dark matter particles scattering off atomic nuclei. She has worked with the DEAP-3600 (Dark matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape discrimination) at SNOLAB and the DarkSide-20k experiment in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. DarkSide-20k is proposed to be the world's largest dark matter detector, and will use silicon-based detectors to look for the light emitted by dark matter interactions with argon.. As part of her work on dark matter detectors, Monroe works on new strategies to detect the dark matter wind. As planet Earth moves through dark matter in the galaxy it should create a wind of dark matter particles that can be easily differentiated from the terrestrial background. She has developed tetrafluorethane-based detectors(DMTPC) with silicon readout for the first demonstration of particle tracking in the low-energy regime relevant for dark matter and geo-neutrino searches. Ultimately Monroe looks to develop a kilotonne observatory for dark matter and neutrino physics. Such an observatory could observe the geoneutrinos created by potassium decay in the earth's core.

With nowhere else to go, and no landlord willing to rent to her, she set up a tipi for her and her 4 children to live in view of the mayor's office. During the protest, which lasted 12 days, she was joined by several others who set up tents and an additional tipi. The protest earned national media attention. In an interview, Shirt explained that, along with housing discrimination, there were other reasons for her protest including child welfare, increased opportunities for education, and a need to address alcohol abuse in Indigenous communities. Shirt met with Edmonton Mayor Ivor Dent and Alberta Premier Harry Strom to outline the social injustices the Indigenous women in her community were facing and was promised that programs would be put in place to address these issuesGeorge, Corinne. ‚Äú‚ÄòIf I Didn‚Äôt Do Something, My Spirit Would Die:‚Äô Grassroots Activism of Aboriginal Women in Calgary and Edmonton, 1951 - 1985.‚Äù University of Calgary, M.A. Thesis, 2007. and the province's plan for welfare housing began.‚ÄúProvince‚Äôs Plan for Welfare Funding,‚Äù Edmonton Journal 7 July, 1969, 4.

It opened in 1951 and closed in 1984. The Cine-Teatro Monumental was designed by the architect Ra√∫l Rodrigues Lima (1909-1980) and was situated at the Pra√ßa Duque de Saldanha in Lisbon. It followed the modernist style appreciated by the authoritarian Estado Novo government of the time and contained a cinema and a theatre. The building was commissioned in 1943 by the Minister of National Education, M√°rio de Figueiredo, and construction was approved in 1946. The structure was covered with stone and ornamented on one of its corners with a large column, topped by an armillary sphere (a symbol much-loved by the Estado Novo). The main public entrance, facing Pra√ßa Duque de Saldanha, had seven arched doors with direct access to the ticket offices. Internal decoration included chandeliers, paintings by Maria Keil and sculptures by Euclides Vaz. The complex was leased by the businessman and impresario Vasco Morgado with the intention of presenting theatrical performances, operettas, and variety shows of the type that could attract audiences large enough to fill the theatre. In the 1970s, an additional small cinema room was added to the top floor, to provide an alternative space to the large cinema. In the 1970s it became increasingly difficult to attract profitable audiences for a theatre with 1086 seats and a cinema with 1967 seats and in 1982 it was decided that the complex should be demolished. Despite public protest this was done in 1984 and a shopping centre and cinema replaced it. In turn, that cinema, with the largest of its four projection rooms containing 378 seats, was forced to close in 2019 because it proved uneconomic, and works were under way to restructure the site in 2020. The original cinema opened with Jacques Tourneur's film The Flame and the Arrow. The first theatrical performance, on 8 November 1951, was the operetta As tr√™s valsas (The three waltzes), starring Laura Alves and Jo√£o Villaret. This was followed by a variety show featuring performances by Laura Alves, Jo√£o Villaret and Eug√©nio Salvador, among others. Laura Alves, who was married to Vasco Morgado until 1967 and continued to collaborate with him after the marriage ended, was a popular, regular performer at the Monumental and was said to have been heartbroken when it was demolished. The theatre was not just used for plays and shows that were expected to run for some time: it became a major venue for leading foreign performers, such as the singers Charles Aznavour, Sylvie Vartan and Rita Pavone.

Born Louis Lombard, he married Emma G√©rin on 24 August 1874. They had seven sons together. He originally worked as a construction engineer specialising in carpentry and iron constructions. Electrobus Electrobus in Saint Servan Lombard-G√©rin designed the Electrobus which was put into production by the Compagnie de Traction par Trolley Automoteur. It was showcased at the Exposition Universelle in 1900. The electrobus incorporated what was known as the Lombard-G√©rin system. An electrically powered pantograph trolley drove synchronously on the overhead contact line in front of the trolley, relieving the ten-meter-long transmission cable - unlike the previously known trailing cables - from the mechanical pull. The contact car itself weighed 18 kilograms and was operated with three-phase current. It did not get its drive energy directly from contact with the contact line, but from electromagnetic induction from drive motors of the car. This required six or seven lines of connecting cable. The three-phase current required for the contact carriage was generated from the alternating current circuit of one of the series motors and was therefore dependent on the driving speed. In addition, the trolley had its own brake, which was operated via a contact on the drive switch, so that synchronous operation was also possible on inclines or slopes. In the Lombard- G√©rin system, the distance between the two catenary wires was 30 centimeters; the overhead contact line was suspended from seven-meter-high masts. The two wires made of hard-drawn copper were each 8.25 millimeters in diameter.Bruce, Ashley R. Lombard-Gerin and Inventing the Trolleybus. (2017) Trolleybooks (UK).

The fund is registered in the Cayman Islands under Cayman Islands company law and headquartered in Central, Hong Kong.  History  Maso Capital was founded in 2012 by two longtime managing directors at Och-Ziff's Asia fund, Manoj Jain and Sohit Khurana, when they decided to start their own Asia hedge fund focused on event-driven investing, merger-arbitrage and convertible arbitrage. The name Maso Capital was chosen as a play on the founding members first names. In July 2012, Jain and Khurana hired Allan Finnerty, a former Mount Kellett executive, as chief operating officer of the fund. Originally hoping to raise only $250 million, by 2015, the fund had scaled to $300 million. As of May 2020, the fund had sold off $151.47 million in US equities with a remaining $247.87 million in US assets under management. The fund also holds multiple equity positions across Asia-Pacific, including Australia on the ASX. = Legal History = Maso Capital has pioneered a complex and time-consuming legal strategy involving a little-known Cayman Island law, Section 238 of Companies Law, to target bad acting Chinese companies that buyout US shareholders, delist on American markets, and consequently relist on Chinese markets for substantially higher valuations than their American buyout. Since its inception, Maso Capital has been involved in a number of similar situations and typically invests as a minority shareholder, a quarter to half of its fund in the undervalued US- listed shares it is targeting. Leveraging Maso Capital‚Äôs strategy and resulting legal precedent, other major investment firms such as Prudential, T. Rowe Price and D.E. Shaw have employed the same strategy in filing similar suits. Through 2020, Maso Capital has publicly filed Section 238 valuation dispute petitions against Bona Film Group; Homeinns Hotel Group; Zhaopin Limited; Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd; Kongzhong Corp; JA Solar Holdings; eHi Car Services; Shanda Games; Qunar Cayman Islands; Trina Solar; Nord Anglia Corporation. = Shanda Games = In 2015, Shanda Games was taken private by a consortium that already owned a majority of the company in a deal valued at $1.9 billion. Maso Capital, which at the time owned 1.6% of Shanda Games, was the sole holdout against the offer price of $7.10 for each American Depository Share. Maso Capital in turn filed what would become a landmark lawsuit alleging the deal was undervalued. The court ruled in favor of Maso Capital and in turn attributed a fair value of $16.68 per share. This ruling was appealed and Maso Capital was eventually awarded $42 million in a landmark lawsuit over a 2015 buyout of Shanda Games Ltd, valuing the company at $1.9 billion. While reflecting on the case to Wall Street Journal reporters, Maso Capital co-founder Manoj Jain stated \\"We believe in constructive engagement with the management of companies we are invested in and our preference is always to achieve results through dialogue. When we have dissented, it has only been to achieve fair value for shareholders by upholding global corporate governance standards.\\" = Qihoo 360 = In 2015, Qihoo 360, one of China‚Äôs largest cybersecurity companies, had agreed to be acquired by a group of investors seeking to take the company private at a valuation of $77 per share or $9.3 billion overall. Minority shareholders in Qihoo 360 had no say in the matter, leveraging their majority stake, big investors forced minority shareholders to agree to the valuation they set themselves in a vote and as a result, all shares were canceled and the company was delisted. At the time of delisting, Maso Capital held $16.9 million in shares of Qihoo 360. In 2018, Qihoo then relisted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange at a $62 billion valuation, yielding a return of more than 550% since they had taken the company private. After the relisting, Maso Capital in turn filed suit against Qihoo360 in the Cayman Courts demanding $92 million in payment based on fair value of the shares it held at the time the company was taken private. Fund managers say $92 million is a conservative estimate of the shares‚Äô true worth and that a more robust expert valuation could in fact yield a much higher share price for Maso Capital. The Cayman Courts have since required Qihoo360 to put $92 million in escrow while the matter is resolved.  Duddell Street Acquisition Corporation  On October 1, 2020, Maso Capital filed for a $175 million IPO on NASDAQ with a blank check company named Duddell Street Acquisition Corporation.

The album documents a live performance of his masterpiece What's Going On and has received mixed feedback from critics. Recording and release The songs on this album were recorded at Washington D.C.‚Äôs John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on May 1, 1972 as part of a Marvin Gaye Day celebration; it was the first live performance he had done in four years, since the onstage death of his singing partner Tammi Terrell. Gaye was very hesitant about the performance and had to be talked into it by his mother: he was still grieving Terrell and disliked performing live anyway. Many of these songs were previously released on the 2001 Deluxe Edition of What's Going On but this is the first edition of the concert as a standalone album and has a new mix; it comes shortly after Motown's release of You're the Man, a studio album intended to follow What's Going On but shelved for decades. Gaye resumed touring in 1974 but this was the only time that he performed the entire album live in one show; this recording misses his performance of ‚ÄúMercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)‚Äù was missed due to a technical error.

The task of the KPQ was to coordinate all press information and propaganda activities, including all mass media available at the time. A total of 550 artists and journalists were active as members of the KPQ during the war, including 280 in the KPQ artists group.National Archives of Austria, Armeeoberkommando, Kriegspressequartier, Pr√§senzstand der Mitglieder des Kriegspressequartier, 1914/1918 From the start of the war its commanding officer was Major General Maximilian Ritter von Hoen.

Anton Faistauer Forum, Maishofen, 2007 p.15. Contributors In 1914 the K.u.k. Telegraphen-Korrespondenz-Bureau (known today as APA) was absorbed into the KPQ. Soon after the outbreak of war, the importance of photography and film for effective public relations was also recognized, alongside the more traditional fields of writing and the fine arts. The KPQ engaged the services of many of Austra-Hungary‚Äôs most famous and established creative names, including Albert Paris G√ºtersloh, Alfred Kubin, Egon Erwin Kisch, Robert Musil, Leo Perutz, Alice Schalek, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Roda Roda, Rainer Maria Rilke, Alfred Polgar, Franz Karl Ginzkey, Franz Theodor Csokor, Felix Salten, Stefan Zweig, Ferenc Moln√°r, Robert Michel und Franz Werfel. They worked with the KPQ for different reasons - some were enthusiastic and patriotic volunteers, others wished to evade conscription, and others still were ordered to work for the war effort. There were a great many applications for admission to the KPQ, but the acceptance criteria were very strict. As the war drew on they became stricter as all reasonably able-bodied men were needed at the front. When recruiting, care was taken to balance the contributors by origin, drawing in both the cisleithan and transleithan parts of the empire.Adalbert Stifter Verein (Ed.): Musen an die Front! Schriftsteller und K√ºnstler im Dienst der k.u.k. Kriegspropaganda 1914-1918. Exhibition catalogue, Munich, 2003, vol 1, p.64 f. In the KPQ, and above all in the art group, women were accepted, contrary to the military norms of the time. The oldest of them, :de:Fritzi Ulreich (1865‚Äì1936), went to the south-eastern front in Belgrade in 1914 and painted the ruined fortifications there, as well as military cemeteries and individual graves. :de:Helene Arnau (1870‚Äì1958) painted from February to May 1917 on the Carinthian front. The youngest, Stephanie Hollenstein (1886‚Äì1944) even disguised herself as a man in order to be able to go into battle with the Standsch√ºtzen.

A great number of pieces were created by this group including paintings, watercolors, drawings, posters, postcards, illustrations, sculptures. The artists were sent to the various fighting fronts with formal credentials to show their status, along with black and yellow armbands labelled \\"Art\\" or \\"War Press Quarters\\". Their task was defined as creating \\"propaganda effective for present use at home and abroad in order to put the achievements of the Wehrmacht in a true light, and for future use, as material that will serve to complement through art the written narrative of history and the subsequent glorification of military exploits.‚ÄùRegulation for pictorial reporting in war. War archives, Vienna, Armeeoberkommando E. Nr. 4992, Nr. 17. The artists were required to find \\"effective and interesting subjects from the life of the war\\". The front-line troops alongside them were required to support them and see to it that they worked on militarily \\"useful things\\" . Landscape painters were expected to draw positions and battlefields, while \\"those talented in figurative work\\" suitable as battle painters were be given the opportunity to observe battles if possible, preferably from artillery positions in order to reduce personal danger. Portraitists were to produce colored or pencil sketches, of \\"the higher leaders, especially excellent officers and men\\". According to the regulations of the KPQ, the guideline was that artists should submit a sketch each week of assignment to the front, and a picture each month away from it. The artists and other contributors had to hand over the works created during their period of service to the KPQ. From there, depending on their suitability, the works were assigned to the Imperial and Royal War Archives, the Imperial and Royal Army Museum or to higher military authorities for permanent decoration of official rooms.Adalbert Stifter Verein (Ed.): Musen an die Front!

Supporting the artists‚Äô group was the picture collection point, housed in the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from the spring of 1916. Here pictures were deposited, registered, framed and managed for the various war picture exhibitions. By the end of the war, 33 exhibitions with over 9,000 works had been made in Germany and in neutral or allied countries. [1] The best-known war painters who were members or associates of of the KPQ were: Albin Egger-Lienz, Anton Faistauer, Anton Kolig, Ferdinand Andri, Alexander Demetrius Goltz, Oskar Laske, Karl Friedrich Gsur, Ludwig Heinrich Jungnickel, Alexander Pock, Victor von Eckhardt und Oskar Kokoschka.

Kolowrat-Krakowsky was able to save numerous filmmakers from the trenches by assigning them work in film production.

In propaganda directed at Italy, they emphasised the strength of the Central Powers and how Italy would lose was the war.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 89 They also attacked Italy for being in the war for purely-imperialistic reasons, and charged that Italian leaders were sacrificing ordinary soldiers‚Äô blood for their own greedy interests.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 86 Austria-Hungary also spread propaganda against Italy's allies, especially the British.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 88 Rivalry between the Italians and the British was exploite, with claims that the British had imperialistic goals for the war and were just using the Italians to achieve them. The Austro-Hungarians argued that the British had already been given opportunities to end the war but were continuing it so that they could gain more territory and influence. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had not helped by stating that \\"if necessary Italy's war aims will be abandoned without consideration\\". The Austro-Hungarians also warned that if the Italians continued to depend for supplies and resources on the British, the Italians' postwar debt would be ruinous, forcing them to pay the British for continuing a war that should have already ended.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria- Hungary, pg. 90  See also * Propaganda in World War I * Heldenkampf in Schnee und Eis (1917 film)  Literature  * Walter Reichel: ‚ÄûPressearbeit ist Propagandaarbeit‚Äú - Medienverwaltung 1914-1918: Das Kriegspressequartier (KPQ).

Release In the Beginning There Was Rhythm was released by Soul Jazz Records on January 28, 2002. The album was released on compact disc and vinyl record. Reception From contemporary reviews, Andy Kellman of AllMusic found that the album \\"does a spectacular job of combining the known with the not so known\\" and that the album showcased \\"post-punk's breadth, showcasing within the grooves, jabs, and rattling waves of static the style's influences (disco, funk, reggae, Krautrock, electronic experimentation) and the styles that the style influenced (indie rock, post- rock, almost every stripe of dance music that followed) at the same time.\\" Kellman felt that \\"one might bemoan the exclusion of Public Image Limited, Associates, the Normal, Magazine, or other bands crucial to the ideology, there's no denying that In the Beginning There Was Rhythm is a great gateway into this expansive, fruitful, trailblazing era.\\" Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork praised the album stating that \\"Every track on this album cooks with the excitement of musicians trying new things.\\" and \\"doesn't have a single limp tune\\" while stating \\"If there's anything's wrong with the disc, it's that it's too short; the story of post-punk could take up several box sets. The disc comes with 35 pages of liner notes, but the record itself doesn't tell a story or connect the songs. Many bands got left out, and it would also be interesting to hear how the bands developed-- for example, to watch the early Human League with its craptronic keyboards and all-guy line-up grow into the band that created the synth-pop masterpiece Dare.\\" Garry Mulholland of The Guardian gave the album a four-star rating, stating \\"to the ranting agit-prop commitment of Gang of Four and Pop Group.

It is situated north of Kayenta on Navajo Nation land, and can be seen from Highway 163 perched on the east edge of Tyende Mesa, where it towers 1,000 feet (300 meters) above the surrounding terrain. The descriptive name stems from its uncanny resemblance to an owl when viewed from the east. Its nearest higher neighbor is Agathla Peak, to the east-northeast, on the opposite side of this highway. Precipitation runoff from this feature drains into El Capitan Wash, which is part of the San Juan River drainage basin. The first ascent of Owl Rock was made in April 1966 by Fred Beckey and Harvey Carter by climbing cracks on the west face, and then bolting up a smooth south nose to the summit. They employed 20 pitons and 14 bolts on this route called Warpath.Arizona Owl Rock, Americanalpineclub.orgFirst Ascent Timeline, deserttowersbook.com This Owl Rock is not to be confused with another located in Arches National Park in Utah. Geology Owl Rock is a red spire composed of Jurassic Wingate Sandstone which is a hard, fine-grained rock which is great for rock climbing, in contrast to the towers and buttes in nearby Monument Valley which have a different composition, de Chelly sandstone. Owl Rock stands atop Tyende Mesa which is formed of the Triassic Chinle Formation. The Owl Rock Member of the Chinle Formation, composed of cherty limestone and limestone conglomerate beds alternating with claystone, mudstone, and siltstone beds, forms the upper half of the mesa, and it overlays the Petrified Forest Member of the lower half.The upper part of the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation and related rocks, southeastern Utah and adjacent areas, USGS The Owl Rock Member is best exposed at its type locality near the base of Owl Rock. Here the member crops out and the resistant limestone beds form a series of jutting ledges that serve partly in protecting the underlying strata. The limestone beds are very resistant to erosion, forming thin ledges interrupting the slopes weathered from the dominant siltstone interbeds. The Owl Rock Member ranges in thickness from approximately 120 to 166 feet, and at Owl Rock the member is 166 feet thick.Owl Rock Member, mindat.org Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Owl Rock.

Art in the Age is known for producing small spirits and artisan goods.  History  Art in the Age was founded in 2008 by Steven Grasse and originally focused on artisan-made goods including clothing and housewares. The store also hosted performances by local musicians and artists. The shop's name was inspired by Walter Benjamin's 1935 essay \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\". Art in the Age‚Äôs original line of spirits began in 2008 with ROOT, an 80-proof cordial inspired by a Native American recipe for root tea, the precursor to root beer. In 2011, the brand was then acquired by William Grant & Sons, who had previously partnered with Grasse on Sailor Jerry Rum and Hendrick's Gin. Art in the Age introduced several other spirits including SNAP, which was flavored like the Pennsylvania Dutch lebkuchen or ginger snap, and RHUBARB which was based on an alcoholic rhubarb tea recipe by Benjamin Franklin. SAGE was a ‚Äúgarden gin‚Äù produced without juniper berries. ROOT, SNAP, SAGE, and RHUBARB were discontinued in early 2017. In 2015, Grasse took the brand back from William Grant & Sons, and released an experimental line of seasonal infusions from the Art in the Age Test Kitchen. The first three spirits in this line were showcased at the 2016 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, with the Art in the Age Beet Vodka earning a double gold medal, and Sweet Potato and Chicory vodkas both winning gold. In late 2017, the Art in the Age shop in Philadelphia underwent a renovation to include a bar and bottle shop. When it reopened, the shop began stocking spirits from their sister company Tamworth Distilling as well as New Liberty Distillery.

After Japanese forces sighted an Allied task force heading toward the Palau Islands, Ro-47 and the submarines , , , and received orders on 27 March 1944 to proceed to patrol areas east of the Palaus. Ro-47 got underway from Kure, Japan, that day, called at Tokuyama to refuel from 28 to 29 March 1944, and set out for her patrol area. On 5 April 1944 she was recalled to Kure, which she reached on 13 April 1944. She was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet on 14 May 1944. =First war patrol= On 13 June 1944 the Combined Fleet activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands, and that day the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, ordered all available Japanese submarines to deploy east of the Marianas. Accordingly, Ro-47 departed Yokosuka, Japan, to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Marianas off Saipan, where the Battle of Saipan began with U.S. landings on the island on 15 June 1944. In July 1944, the 6th Fleet ordered most of its submarines, including Ro-47, to withdraw from the Marianas. Ro-47 departed her patrol area on 10 July 1944 and on 16 July arrived at Maizuru, where she began repairs and an overhaul. She later moved to Kure. =Second war patrol= On 15 September 1944, U.S. forces invaded the Palau Islands, landing on Angaur and on Peleliu. Ro-47 got underway from Kure on 17 September 1944 with orders to attack the U.S. invasion fleet off Peleliu, assigned a patrol area south of the Palaus. On 24 September 1944, she received an order to proceed at full speed to a new patrol area in the Philippine Sea east of the Palaus. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= The United States Navy destroyer escort was steaming independently in the Philippine Sea northeast of the Palaus on a voyage from Peleliu to Guam when at 01:03 on 26 September 1944 she detected a vessel on the surface on radar at a range of .

The material was written and recorded concurrently with the sessions for the band's fourth studio album All Hope Is Gone (2008). However, its emphasis on experimentation and a more melodic rock sound from Slipknot's work has kept it classified as a separate body of work. The album was scheduled for release during the latter half of the band's We Are Not Your Kind touring cycle, which was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Background and recording The album originates back to the recording sessions for Slipknot's fourth studio album All Hope Is Gone (2008). Two separate recording sessions in two separate studios occurred concurrently; the All Hope Is Gone sessions, which included the entirety of the nine-piece band, and the Look Outside Your Window sessions, which only included four band members; Corey Taylor (vocals), Jim Root (guitar), Shawn Crahan (percussion), and Sid Wilson (turntables). Crahan noted that the sessions began with himself and Root initially, with Taylor and Wilson coming in shortly later, and it became a group project shared among the four of them, separate from Slipknot, in his eyes. Taylor noted that, while the band pursued their regular heavy metal sound in the All Hope Is Gone sessions, the members who took part in the Look Outside Your Window sessions took a more experimental approach to the music. He described the material as far more melodic than typical Slipknot material, with more of a rock music-vibe, with some more artistic qualities akin to the work of Radiohead. Root recalled unconventional approaches in the sessions, including recording the song of a frog croaking, and then building a song around that recording, and having Taylor sing a track from the bottom of a well, making it sound like he was singing in a cavern. Eleven songs were recorded in the sessions.https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-slipknot-unreleased-album-to-be- titled-look-outside-your-window/ At one point, Taylor, who loved the music from both sessions, attempted to combine the material from both projects into one collective album, creating what he described as an alternate tracklist/sequencing of All Hope Is Gone containing Look Outside Your Window material intermixed. However, due to turmoil within the band at the time, Taylor was unable to find support from any other band members on the endeavor, and he subsequently dropped the idea. Only one song from the Look Outside Your Window sessions ended up making it onto All Hope Is Gone; the track \\"Til We Die\\" originated from the Look Outside Your Window sessions, and was placed on the All Hope Is Gone special edition as a bonus track Despite the association, Crahan maintains that the album is a \\"very unique art piece on its own\\". Release and promotion Crahan and Taylor have mentioned various plans for releasing the material over the years. Crahan noted that they had wanted to release it ever since it‚Äôs creation in 2008, but has had difficulty with figuring out how to time the release without it interfering with other albums or band downtime. However, the album is owned by the four, not the label, so they are in charge of its release. Plans to release it early in the touring cycle for their We Are Not Your Kind (2019) album arose, though the plans were delayed as to not take away the momentum of said album, which ended up topping the album chart in the US much to Taylor's surprise. In January 2020, Crahan revealed the album, at one point had an unannounced surprise Christmas 2019 release date, but it was delayed again, for undisclosed reasons. Crahan noted that there are still plans for it to be released during the latter half of the We Are Not Your Kind touring cycle, though the COVID-19 pandemic forced the band to cancel much of their 2020 touring or reschedule for 2021. No concrete release date has been given, though publications have predicted a release in 2020 or 2021.

It lay immediately north of York Minster, and its grounds are now known as Dean's Park. Construction York Minster was severely damaged by a fire in 1137. Roger de Pont L'√âv√™que, Archbishop of York from 1154 to 1181, rebuilt the minster, and appears to have also begun the construction of the palace. In 1179, the college and chapel of St Mary and All Angels, also known as St Sepulchre, was built next to the palace, and the history of the structure became intertwined. In 1268, the grounds of the palace were extended up to the city walls. The palace was used for a wide variety of purposes. The justices of oyer and terminer sat there in 1275, while in 1327-1328, Edward III of England based his court at the palace while he was leading a campaign against the Scots; the palace was altered at great expense to host him. By 1385, it also housed the archbishop's prison, probably in the crypt below St Sepulchre's Chapel. In 1400, a new chamber was added from which Henry IV of England could watch a tournament being held in the palace grounds. Richard III of England stayed at the palace in 1483, as did Henry VII of England in 1487, and Margaret Tudor in 1503. Ingram's House, shortly before demolition St Sepulchre's College was dissolved in 1547, while in the 1560s, Thomas Young removed the lead from the palace's roof. This was supposedly to purchase Grays Court for his son, George, the building probably being extended in part with stone taken from the palace. By 1616, the palace was in ruins, and the grounds were sold to Arthur Ingram. He rebuilt part of the palace as his own house, and laid out gardens in the remainder of the grounds, which include a fishpond, tennis court and bowling green. Charles I of England stayed in the house in 1642, but after Ingram's death, his descendants divided the property into small tenements and let them out. Minster Library, former chapel of the palace In 1734, a theatre was built on the site of the tennis court. In 1780, the former great hall of the palace was rebuilt as a riding school, noted in 1785 as the site of an early balloon ascent. In 1799, a panorama depicting the Royal Navy at the Spithead review was displayed in the building. By this time, Ingram's house was largely in ruins. York Minster purchased the whole site in 1814, and demolished Ingram's house, using the site for its stone yard, and also demolished the riding school. The palace's former chapel was restored for use as the minster library, and is now known as the Old Palace. In 1823, the remainder of the site was again laid out as the Deanery Gardens. Demolition of some sheds revealed a 12th-century arcade from the original palace. More recently, the grounds have become known as Dean's Park, and the stone yard has moved to Deangate. During World War II, the park was excavated to house water tanks, but it has since been restored. In 1987, the arcade was rededicated as a war memorial to the dead of the world wars and 19th-century conflicts, and since 1997, it has been grade I listed.

With occasional periods of friendly relations or efforts to improve relations, two countries predominantly maintained cold or openly hostile relations. The period of close relations developed right after the end of the World War II when Yugoslavia pushed for socioeconomic integration of Albania into Yugoslavia within the Balkan Federation (bargaining with the idea of unification of Albania with kinship region of Kosovo), but they turned into sharp antagonism after the 1948 Tito‚ÄìStalin split. History Spheres of Conquest in Ottoman Balkans during the First Balkan War. Albanian early relations with Yugoslavia were preceded by its prior relations with the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro and the experience of Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. Predominantly Eastern Orthodox Balkan nations gained their independence a couple of decades before Albania so that the Albanian National Awakening was faced with state-building and regional balance of power games fueled by conflicting nationalist claims. This situation reached it peak at the time of the First Balkan War in which regional powers of Kingdom of Bulgaria, Kingdom of Serbia, Kingdom of Greece and Kingdom of Montenegro divided among themselves the remaining European territory of the Sick man of Europe. While their earlier efforts were fueled with the intention of national liberation, during the First Balkan War regional balance of power played more prominent role in decision making so that Albanian territories were divided by its neighbors. At the same time Albanian state started to develop, and due to concern of Great Powers over the Russian expansion into Mediterranean the independent Principality of Albania was created along the cost. This state however did not include Albanian inhabited region of Kosovo as well as numerous Albanian population in modern day North Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. The border remained unclear all trough the World War I (when Serbian Albanian Golgotha took place) and in early years after the establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (which was created after Serbia united with Montenegro, Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs). Subsequent to 1948 Yugoslavia developed comparatively open Titoist system economically linked to Western Europe and diplomaticaly active with Non-bloc countries. Albania was on the other hand highly self-isolated aytarkyc states, especially following the Soviet‚ÄìAlbanian split and Sino-Albanian split. =Kingdom of Yugoslavia relations with Albania= In 1921 Kingdom of Yugoslavia supported the establishment of the Republic of Mirdita in it efforts to push for more advantageous border demarcation for Yugoslavia. The Conference of Ambassadors decided to deal with the issue of Albanian-Yugoslav border and it published them soon after the creation of Republic of Mirdita yet the United Kingdom insisted on slight adaptations in the region of Debar, Prizren and Kastrati in the interest of Yugoslavia. In an effort to gain the favor of the Border Demarcation Commission two countries established formal diplomatic relations in March of 1922. =World War II= During the World War II Italian protectorate of Albania and subsequent German occupation of Albania created effective Axis client state of Greater Albania which covered parts of Yugoslavia and persecuted local non-Albanian population. National Liberation Movement of Albania closely cooperated and was significantly influenced by the Yugoslav Partisans. =Relations after the World War II= Following the end of World War II Yugoslavia was reorganized as the socialist federation of six constituent federal subject republics. In addition, within the Socialist Republic of Serbia two autonomous regions were created one of which was the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija with ethnic Albaian majority. In July 1946, Yugoslavia and Albania signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation followed by a series of technical and economic agreements aimed at integration of the Albanian and Yugoslav economies. Serbo-Croatian became a required subject in Albanian high schools at that time. At the Party of Labour of Albania plenum in February and March 1948 leadership voted to merge the Albanian and Yugoslav economies and militaries while Ko√ßi Xoxe proposed appealing to Belgrade to admit Albania as a seventh Yugoslav republic. Relations turned into sharp antagonism after the 1948 Tito‚ÄìStalin split.

Life  Gifford was born on May 8, 1829 in Busti, New York, the son of Gideon Gifford and Millicent Cornell. He was a descendent of Robert Cushman, who played a key role in securing the charter for the Plymouth Colony. Gifford worked as a farmer in Jamestown. He was initially a member of the Whig Party, but became a Republican after the later party was organized. He was secretary of the Chautauqua Patrons' Relief Association, secretary of the Central New York Co-operative Fire Insurance Association, and president of the Farmer's Board of Trade. He was also heavily involved in the New York State Grange. He served as Secretary and Master of the Jamestown Grange, and Master and County Deputy of the Chautauqua County Grange. He served as Assistant Steward of the State Grange from 1880 to 1884, Overseer of the State Grange from 1884 to 1890, and Master of the State Grange from 1890 to 1894. In 1890, Gifford was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican, representing the Chautauqua County 1st District. He served in the Assembly in 1891 and 1892.

In 1863, Ioan asked to build a church in the city center, but delays by the authorities angered him, prompting him to build a hospital with the materials he had purchased. Grecescu did not abandon the idea of a church, purchasing a plot of land near the hospital, overlooking the Danube. Further delays caused local residents to protest. Moreover, in 1867, Prince Carol I was on a visit to the city. He met Grecescu and, through the effort of his traveling companion Carol Davila, quickly arranged for plans to be drawn up in the capital Bucharest by the city architect. The cornerstone was laid on 10 May 1868, the second anniversary of Carol‚Äôs accession to the throne. It was modeled after the Curtea de Arge»ô Cathedral, with two small spires in front, and fitting into the classic style of old Romanian monasteries. The building is solid brick. Construction proceeded rapidly, with Carol inspecting progress in spring 1869. Gheorghe Tattarescu painted the interior in 1872; he was paid 1000 gulden by another couple. Grecescu died in 1875, when the church was nearly finished. It was consecrated the following year. In 1884, the church was named the city cathedral.

The historic district is bordered by Hempstead Street, Richards Drive, Hampton Street, Lincoln Street, Harding Terrace, Terry Drive and the eastern end of Haven's Beach in Sag Harbor. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 10, 2019. Ninevah Beach Early history St. David AME Zion Cemetery During colonial times, the north-west of East Hampton village was the free black and Native American's enclave along the Indian path to Sag Harbor. When Sag Harbor became the first U.S. port of entry after Northwest Harbor in 1789, the Black and Native populations were relegated to Eastville, southeast of the town. In 1839, due to a growing reluctance to allow blacks in the other churches' burying grounds, the African Methodist Church of Eastville broke ground on a church and cemetery on Eastville Avenue on the southern side of Hampton Street. Reverend J. P. Thompson, the first pastor, is buried in the St David African Methodist Episcopal Zion Cemetery, which accommodated Irish immigrants, Montauketts and African-Americans. The Indian path was paved (NY 114) and in 1945 the road was widened, becoming the main road between the two communities, with the AME church as the spiritual anchor of Eastville. (Eastville is NR Listed as part of Sag Harbor Village Historic District Boundary Increase, 1994.https://parks.ny.gov/documents/shpo/national- register/MaryEBellHouseCenterMorichesSuffolkCounty.pdf) The first of the three subdivisions to be developed was Azurest, located to the east of the old Sag Harbor Village Historic District. African-American families began purchasing property for summer retreats during the late 1940s and while unable to get loans, built summer cottages on large lots alternating homesites with lots deliberately left empty. Lot buyers were doctors, business owners, lawyers, academics and artists. Many prominent blacks during the civil rights era bought lots. A Brooklyn schoolteacher, Maude Terry (1887‚Äì1968), while vacationing at a cottage in Eastville, came up with the idea of a private community for black families on the 20-acre parcel laying undeveloped between Hampton Street and Gardiner's Bay, which belonged to the Gale family. Amaza Lee Meredith (1895‚Äì1984), a black architect and Terry's sister, came up with a plan to sub-divide the property; their descendants, the Richards, still occupy two cottages in the community. With growth during the 1950s and 1960s and the arrival of celebrities like Lena Horne, Harry Belafonte, the restaurateur B. Smith and Allan Houston of the New York Knicks, the community grew to rival Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard as a black vacation destination. Over 300 Black families bought in, creating the adjoining communities of Sag Harbor Hills and Ninevah Beach, linked by dirt roads. Three other nearby subdivisions, Lighthouse Lane, Hillside Terrace and Chatfield's Hill, also attracted black home buyers, but were not included in the historic designation due to the 50-year rule for contributing properties. Summers in SANS Ninevah Beach contributing property Paul Ruffins, former editor of The Crisis magazine for the NAACP, wrote of spending summers at Ninevah Beach when growing up. Each summer SANS residents swelled to 1000, this at a time when Sag Harbor was not the trendy vacation spot it is today. The influx served to buoy the town financially when the Bulova watch Factory and Grumman Aircraft Plant closed. Ruffins remembers a time when a pair of sunglasses left on the beach was there the next day, walking in the woods of the nature preserve and meeting the other children of the founders. Jim Brannen, a NYFD firefighter and part-time contractor sold John L. Ruffins the lot that became the family retreat.

His naval career began in 1982 and spanned almost 32 years. In early 2014, he retired from the Navy and later joined Lockheed Martin, providing aviation sustainment operations support to the US military. Early life and education Timothy Stirling Matthews was born in 1958. He graduated from the University of Colorado in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering. Naval career Matthews joined the United States Navy, and was commissioned as an aeronautical maintenance duty officer though its Aviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida in August 1982. He attended the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, from which he received a master's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1995. He served on deployments in the Mediterranean Sea, Western Pacific, and Persian Gulf on board the aircraft carriers , and . He also served ashore with Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 (VQ-2) in Rota, Spain, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington, and Carrier Air Wing Fourteen. Matthews served as Consolidated Automated Support Systems (CASS) Fleet Introduction leader in office PMA-260 of the Naval Air Systems Command. In September 2004, he became the director of the Joint Depot Maintenance Activities Group at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. He became executive officer the Naval Air Station Jacksonville in 2005. In this role he oversaw a series of cultural changes to increase organizational efficiency, including the implementation of Lean Six Sigma, and Sean Covey's Four Disciplines of Execution. On 17 August 2007 Matthews assumed command of the Fleet Readiness Center Southeast. He was promoted to the rank of rear admiral (lower half) on 25 June 2009. In August 2009, he became the commander, Fleet Readiness Centers and NAVAIR Assistant Commander for Logistics and Industrial Operations. The following year, he was one of three admirals on the administrative panel that reviewed the case of astronaut Lisa Nowak, and recommended her separation from the Navy with an other than honorable discharge and reduction in rank. His final assignment, in August 2011, was as director of the Fleet Readiness Division. In this role he was confronted with a major crisis in the form of the United States budget sequestration in 2013. Faced with automatic budget cuts, Matthews implemented some efficiency changes, and deferred the scheduled maintenance of some ships until 2014, but continuing high-tempo operations with ships beyond their scheduled maintenance periods shortened their service life, which would ultimately reduce the size of the Navy. The sequestration affected not only the funds available for maintenance activities, but also the time and resources through restriction on overtime. Reductions in training time for ships' crews increased the maintenance difficulties in the medium term, and the possibility of layoffs from contractors and the consequent loss of skilled labor posed a long term threat. Matthews was also able to obtain some relief by reprogramming funds earmarked for other purposes. All these were short-term measures that assumed the crisis would soon be over, and would not continue into 2014, but this was far from certain. In August 2013, Matthews appeared before the House Armed Services Committee to plead for relief from sequestration. Ultimately, the political crisis was resolved by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which ended sequestration and restored funding, but Matthews decided to retire. Awards and decorations he received include the Legion of Merit twice, the Meritorious Service Medal four times, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal four times, the Virgil Lemmon Award for Maintenance Excellence, and the Association of Old Crows' Maintenance Award. Business career Matthews officially retired from the Navy on 1 January 2014. On 1 June 2014, Matthews joined Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, Texas, where he worked as Vice President for F-35 Lightning II Sustainment Operations. In this role he oversaw the implementation of a suite of next generation analytics, using artificial intelligence and digital transformation technologies to improve the efficiency of aircraft sustainment activities for Lockheed Martin's F-35, C-130J Super Hercules and the LM-100J Hercules programs. The prospective pay off was huge; it was estimated that sustainment of the F-35 alone would cost more that $1 trillion. Matthews rejected an April 2019 proposal by William B. Roper Jr., the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), for the government to reacquire intellectual property rights on military equipment so that sustainment activities could be carried out by the Air Force or contractors other than the aircraft manufacturer. \\"I‚Äôm more convinced than ever\\", Matthews said \\"that that would be a mistake.\\" References External links Category:Living people Category:University of Colorado alumni Category:United States Navy rear admirals Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the Meritorious Service Medal (United States) ","title":"Timothy S.

Engraving by Bauer for a 1703 edition of Metamorphoses. Transgender literature is a collective term used to designate the literary production that addresses, has been written by or portrays people of diverse gender identity. Representations in literature of people that transition their gender have existed for millennia, with the earliest instance probably being the book Metamorphoses, by the Roman poet Ovid. In the twentieth century its notable the novel Orlando (1928), by Virginia Woolf, considered one of the first transgender novels in English and whose plot follows a bisexual poet that changes gender from male to female and lives for hundreds of years. For decades, publications that covered transgender topics were mainly centered on memoirs, with a lengthy tradition that had its earliest example in Man into Woman (1933), by Lili Elbe, and that has lasted until the present times with autobiographical books like The Secrets of My Life (2017), by Caitlyn Jenner. Other memoirs written by trans people that have amassed critical success are: Gender Outlaw (1994), by Kate Bornstein; Man Enough to be a Woman (1996), by Jayne County; Redefining Realness (2014), by Janet Mock; among others. Nonetheless, apart from Orlando, the twentieth century saw the appearance of other fiction works with transgender characters that saw commercial success. Among them is Myra Breckinridge (1968), a satirical novel written by Gore Vidal that follows a trans woman hellbent on world domination and bringing down patriarchy. The book sold more than two million copies after publication, but was panned by critics. The emergence of transgender literature as a distinct branch of LGBT literature took place in the 2010s, when the number of fiction works focused on the topic saw a pronounced growth and diversification, which was accompanied by a greater academic and general interest in the area and a process of differentiation with the rest of LGBT literature. This gave rise to a trend that saw more books being written by transgender authors whose main intended audience were transgender people. In 2020, Dutch-born Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, who has defined themself as a non-binary person, won the prestigious International Booker Prize with their novel The Discomfort of Evening.  In Spanish  In Spanish-speaking countries, transvestism as a means of expressing diverse gender identities and criticizing conservative societies, which had traditionally penalized sexual diversity, reached its heyday in the second half of the twentieth century, thanks to the works of some of the best known Latin American writers of the time, like Severo Sarduy, Jos√© Donoso, Manuel Puig and Reinaldo Arenas. It is notable that gender-bending was, in the majority of cases, of men who transitioned to female, not of women transitioning to male. Among the best known works of this time are: Hell Has No Limits, a novel by Jos√© Donoso published in 1966 whose protagonist is Manuela, a trans woman who lives with her daughter in a deteriorated town called El Olivo; Cobra (1972), by Cuban writer Severo Sarduy, that uses an experimental narration to tell the story of a transvestite who wants to transform her body; and Kiss of the Spider Woman (1976), a novel by Manuel Puig in which a young revolutionary called Valent√≠n shares a cell with Molina, who is presented as a gay man but who during their conversations implies that his identity might be of a transgender woman, as its shown in the next passage: In recent years, many books in Spanish have garnered commercial and critical success. In Argentina, one of the most famous examples is Las malas (2019), by Camila Sosa Villada, a novel inspired by the youth of the author where she narrates the lives of a group of transgender prostitutes working in the city of C√≥rdoba. The book became a critical and commercial sensation, with more than eight editions in Argentina alone and translations to many languages in the first year of publication. From recent Ecuadorian literature, one example is Gabriel(a) (2019), by Ra√∫l Vallejo Corral, a novel which won the Miguel Donoso Pareja Prize with the story of a transgender woman that falls in love with an executive and faces a discriminatory society in her attempt to become a journalist.

She was renamed Ro-48 on 31 July 1943 and was attached provisionally to the Maizuru Naval District that day. Launched on 15 October 1943, she was completed and commissioned on 31 March 1944. She was completed with a radar detector installed and a modified conning tower designed to be less visible to radar signals. Service history =March‚ÄìJuly 1944= Upon commissioning, Ro-48 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. She was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet on 3 July 1944. =First war patrol= On 13 June 1944 the Combined Fleet activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands, and the Battle of Saipan began with U.S. landings on Saipan on 15 June 1944. On 5 July 1944, Ro-48 departed Kure, Japan, to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Marianas off Saipan. She arrived in her patrol area, within of Saipan, on 12 July 1944, and that date received orders to stand by to rescue Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service pilots stranded on Tinian. While she was north of Saipan at 21:30 Japan Standard Time on 14 July 1944, her commanding officer reported U.S. forces had forced him to submerge and that he was moving to a new position.

It was the oldest standing temple dedicated to Mars within the city. Location and history Situated around two kilometres from the Porta Capena, the Temple of Mars used to sit just outside the Porta Appia, beyond the Aurelian Walls. It was positioned overlooking the valley where the brook Almo ran, and it stood next to a grove.Platner, pg. 327 Its name stemmed from a rise in the road leading to it (in Latin a clivus). According to Livy, the temple was vowed to the god Mars in the aftermath of the Roman defeat at the Battle of the Allia in 390 BCE by the Senones. It was dedicated on 1 June 387 by Titus Quinctius, one of the Duumviri sacrorum.Livy, Book 6, 5.8 In 189 BCE the Via Appia was paved from the Porta Capena to this point, along with the stretch of road that linked the Via Appia to the temple (the Clivus Martis). This road was then referred to as the Via Tecta, named after the construction of a portico along the road. Within the temple were a statue of Mars and figures of wolves, which were considered sacred to the god. The statue of Mars was most probably the one erected by the former consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 211 BCE, fulfilling a vow made during the conquest of Syracuse in 212 BCE.Luci, Fabio, Monuments and Inscriptions in Republican Rome: Linguistic Framework for Interpreting Art and Text (2019), pgs. 249-250 The writer Julius Obsequens noted in his book the \\"Prodigiorum liber\\" (Book of Prodigies) that observers in the past had seen the statue sweating.Rome and Art, TEMPLUM MARTIS IN CLIVO Also within the temple was kept one of the two Lapis manalis stones. This stone was used as part of a ceremony of Etruscan origin called the aquaelicium which sought to produce rain in times of drought. The stone was removed from the temple by the pontifices, and taken by procession to the Capitoline Hill, and a sacrifice was made to the god Jupiter, petitioning him to send rain. The district around the temple, reaching as far as the Almo, was known as ad Martis. It was in this area around the temple that the soldiers of the Republic would assemble before heading off to fight their wars, and it was here that they would return to lay down their arms prior to re-entering the city. It was also the spot where, on 15 July, the Transvectio equitum procession would commence, to commemorate the victory at the Battle of Lake Regillus. Today, this temple no longer exists, and there are no details as to when it was demolished. It was mentioned in the Einsiedeln Itinerary as still standing in the 8th century. No images exist of the temple except for a frieze on the Arch of Constantine.

The first trade agreement between Pakistan and Yugoslavia was signed in 1949 while Yugoslavia became the first socialist state to provide development credits to Pakistan. In early years after the World War II Yugoslavia tried to stay neutral in disputes between India ad Pakistan. This changed after the India, Yugoslavia and Egypt initiated the establishment of the Non-aligned Movement while Pakistan joined Western Bloc led Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. On 13 till 16 January 1961 President of Pakistan Ayub Khan paid the first State visit of Pakistan to Yugoslavia. This visit was part of his efforts to strenghten relations with Yugoslavia despite this country's close regations with New Delhi. Pakistan diplomacy was however shocked when in 1965 Yugoslavia issued joint communique with India stating that the Kashmir question was as an internal affair of India. After Pakistani protests Yugoslavia took a more balanced approach during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, it supported Tashkent Declaration and was not opposed to Pakistani membership in the Non-Aligned Movement. In 1968 the credits given by Yugoslavia to Pakistan amounted to 104.7 million US dollars. In 1968 President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito paid his first return State visit to Pakistan.

Toponymy  The name Imezdaten comes from the Berber word Ar zedat meaning \\"those who go forward\\" or \\"The Brave\\". The name of the village is \\"Imezdaten\\" and is Arabized to \\"Mezdatta\\" and \\"M'zid√®ne\\" by the Arabs. The name was mangled by secretaries of the generals in dispatches and reports during Algeria's period of French colonialism ().  Location  Geographically, the village is the last locality of the Municipality of Tizi-Ouzou towards the limits of the region of Maatka, on the national road CW 147. The village is located in a mountain called Ighil Bou Rioul in the tribe of Betrouna. The village of Imezdaten affects 3 communes at the same time, Tizi ouzou, Ma√¢tkas and Tirmitine. It has the highest elevation among the 22 villages of Betrouna, estimated at 726 m above sea level. It is considered to be one of the main villages in \\"ibetrunen\\". It is surrounded in the north by the villages of Taddart oufella and Ighil Ouberouak, to the west by the municipality of Tirmitine, to the east by the Amejoud Forest, and to the south by the two villages of Igariden and Anegah de la commune of Maatka.  Transport  The village of Mezdatta is crossed to the west by the national road CW 147 which passes through the region of Betrouna towards the Commune of Maatka. The village has two public transport lines including the line of \\"Betrouna - Tizi-ouzou\\" which leads to the village stop (the city) from the \\"South-West stop\\" in Tizi-ouzou. The second line is ‚ÄúMa√¢tkas - Tizi-ouzou‚Äù which runs from the stop of annar amellal to the stop of Mezdatta (the city). The two lines of the village have almost the same distance, 15 km, and the transportation is done by Nissan, Ford and Hyundai vans with 15 seats. It takes about 25 to 35 minutes to reach the village stop and there are several stops in different villages of Betrouna region along the way.  Nature  Imezdaten contains several plants including Olives, Fig trees, Prickly pears, pomegranates, and grapes, and with several genera. In the Amejoud Forest (which occupies a certain area of the village), there are also many plants, including fruit trees such as the Strawberry Tree, the acorns of the Holm Oak, Cork Oaks, Quinces, and many species below such as Allium triquetrum, mushrooms and others. Plant life occupies a large area of the village, including forests and local farms.  History  On 6 June 1871, Tizi Ouzou's column found Oued-fali impassable and had to wait to cross it until water had subsided. They spent that day in Imezdaten. The difficult climb was cut off by trenches and olive and ash trees. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the French reached Ath Betrouna, which contains three \\"toufik\\". There were several battles, including the battle of Ait khelifa and the battle of Cherif Boubaghla. The conflict resulted in three dead and 21 wounded by the men of imezdaten and ibetrunen. After great resistance and many deaths, the French dominated the tribe of ibetrunen and the village was completely evacuated. The villagers abandoned their shelters and fled, and the village became empty. It was then a locality under French domination.

He has published 5 books with Disney Hyperion, which have been translated to over 20 foreign languages. Robert Beatty is an executive producer for the television adaptation of Willa of the Wood, which is in the early stages of development. Early life Beatty began writing at the age of 11 when his mother provided him with an old electric typewriter to play with. He was an avid reader of fantasy and wrote books in his free time. After receiving a TI-99 personal computer from his father, Beatty taught himself to code and learned six programming languages prior to enrolling in college. From 15 years old until he entered college, he worked as a draftsman at a company that constructed automated assembly lines. Beatty learned that he was effective at troubleshooting and streamlining production. Robert Beatty attended Michigan State University where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in computer science. His continued interest in writing led him to enroll in literature courses, as well. Career =Technology entrepreneur= Beatty earns Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year award While still in engineering school, Beatty gained employment as an engineer drafting automotive parts for a local manufacturer called MSP. Frustrated with the disorganization and inefficiency of the factory, Beatty created and implemented a communication system called Plexus at MSP that successfully improved and restructured the operation of the company. Following the successful transformation of MSP, the Plexus software was in high demand among companies seeking to streamline manufacturing, lower costs, and improve quality control. Beatty and Richard McDermott, president and owner of MSP, started Plexus Systems, LLC in 1995 to meet this demand and sell customized Plexus software designed by Beatty to meet the specific needs of each company. As the CEO and chief architect of Plexus, Beatty became one of the leading pioneers in the development of cloud computing. Beatty was the 2007 recipient of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. =Novelist= Beatty autographing books and greeting fans at an author event In 2006, Beatty sold the majority of his shares in Plexus, but continued with the company as a technical consultant and Chairman of the Board, at which time Beatty began to focus on his writing career. Intent on improving his writing skills, Beatty developed relationships with the editors of Narrative Magazine. He later served as Narrative Magazine‚Äôs Chief Technical Officer, a member of the board of directors, and eventually Chairman of the Board. Encouraged by his eldest daughter, Beatty began to write for a younger audience. With the encouragement and support of his family, he wrote the first book in the Serafina Series, Serafina and the Black Cloak, which was acquired by Disney Hyperion. Understanding the importance of marketing from his experience with Plex Systems, Beatty and his family produced a book trailer for Serafina and the Black Cloak. The book trailer was an important component of the successful launch of Serafina and the Black Cloak on July 14, 2015, which eventually rose to the #1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller List and remained on the list for over 60 weeks. Following the success of Serafina and the Black Cloak, Disney Hyperion decided to create a series based on ‚ÄúSerafina‚Äù and contracted two more novels with Beatty. Serafina and the Twisted Staff was released on July 12, 2016, debuting at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List. Serafina and the Splintered Heart launched July 3, 2017 placing the Serafina Series on the New York Times Bestseller List. Beatty's success continued with the debut of the first book in a new series, Willa of the Wood, which launched at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List in the summer of 2018. Disney Hyperion signed Robert Beatty for three more novels: Serafina and the Seven Stars released in July 2019, Willa of Dark Hollow expected in 2021, and an additional novel yet to be determined. =Television production= Robert Beatty will serve as an executive producer for the television adaption of Willa of the Wood.

The film stars Kermit Maynard, Robert Warwick, and Jim Thorpe.  Plot  Raoul Marlin kills a fur trapper, and is captured and imprisoned by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Snaky, a member of his gang, kills the two Mounties guarding him, and helps him escape, but another Mountie, Jim Wilson, tracks him down and recaptures him. However, as they are making their way back to jail, more members of the gang Marlin belongs to, including the gang's leader, Jean, waylay them and free Marlin once again. Wilson and his partner, Rogers, begin tracking the gang down. The trail leads them to a general store which is owned by Duval, who is Jean's second-in-command, as well as being in love with her. Wilson hatches a plan to go undercover and impersonate a notorious thief and murderer, Benet. When he gets to the store, he witnesses Duval kill an Indian, when the Indian refuses to sell his furs for fifty cents each. Jean tells him to get out of there, but Wilson gives her his story of being Benet, and wanting to partner with her and split the black market in the region with her. Wilson's cover is further bolstered when Rogers begins spreading a \\"rumor\\" around town that Wilson is Benet. After spreading the rumor, Rogers leaves to go get more Mounties to help break up the gang. Duval, jealous of the attention Jean is bestowing on Wilson/Benet, as well as being upset over being shut out of their deal, begins to dig into Benet's history. At the newspaper office, he finds out that the real Benet had been hung a short time earlier. He takes the newspaper article to Jean, who is furious, and gathers her gang to go after Wilson. Just as they are about to hunt Wilson down, Rogers and the others Mounties arrive. Most of the gang is arrested, but Jean and Marlin escape. Wilson takes out after the two. As he catches up with them, Marlin gets a bead on him, but is shot and killed by Jean, who has developed feelings for Wilson. In exchange, Wilson lets Jean escape.

Often this is because the targeted party has an ideology perceived as unacceptable or extremist.  National politics  Beginning in the late 1980s, the term was introduced into the discourse on parliamentary politics by Belgian commentators. At that time, the far-right Flemish nationalist Vlaams Blok party began to make significant electoral gains. Because the Vlaams Blok was considered a racist group by many, the other Belgian political parties committed to exclude the party from any coalition government, even if that forced the formation of grand coalition governments between ideological rivals. Commentators dubbed this agreement Belgium's cordon sanitaire. In 2004, its successor party, Vlaams Belang changed its party platform to allow it to comply with the law. While no formal new agreement has been signed against it, it nevertheless remains uncertain whether any mainstream Belgian party will enter into coalition talks with Vlaams Belang in the near future. Several members of various Flemish parties have questioned the viability of the cordon sanitaire. With the electoral success of nationalist and extremist parties on the left and right in recent European history, the term has been transferred to agreements similar to the one struck in Belgium: * In Italy, the Italian Communist Party and Italian Social Movement were excluded from Christian democrats-led coalition governments during the Cold War. The end of the Cold War along with the Tangentopoli scandal and Mani pulite investigation resulted in a dramatic political realignment. * After German reunification, East Germany's former ruling party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, or SED), reinvented itself first (in 1990) as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and then (in 2005 before the elections) as the Left Party, in order to merge with the new group WASG that had emerged in the West. In the years following 1990, the other German political parties have consistently refused to consider forming a coalition with the PDS/Left Party on a federal level (which was possible in 2005 and 2013), while on state levels, so-called red-red coalitions with the SPD were formed (or red-red- green). The term cordon sanitaire, though, is quite uncommon in Germany for coalition considerations. A strict political non-cooperation (in which The Left would participate, should the instance ever arise) is only exercised against right-wing parties, such as the Republicans, and even the Republicans have exercised a cordon against the neo-Nazi National Democrats. Since 2013, the established major parties have refused to form state-level coalitions with the new right-wing populist party AfD. * In the Netherlands, a parliamentary cordon sanitaire was put around the Centre Party (Centrumpartij, CP) and later on the Centre Democrats (Centrumdemocraten, CD), ostracising their leader Hans Janmaat. During the 2010 Cabinet formation, Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) charged other parties of plotting a cordon sanitaire; however, there never was any agreement between the other parties on ignoring the PVV. Indeed, the PVV was floated several times as a potential coalition member by several informateurs throughout the government formation process, and the final minority coalition under Mark Rutte between Rutte's People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the Christian Democratic Appeal was officially \\"condoned\\" by the PVV. The coalition collapsed after PVV withdrew its support in 2012. Since then, all major parties refuse to cooperate with PVV. * Some (though not all) of the Non-Inscrits members of the European Parliament are unaffiliated because they are considered to lie too far on the right of the political spectrum to be acceptable to any of the European Parliament party groups. * In France, the policy of non-cooperation with Front National, together with the majoritarian two-round electoral system, leads to the permanent underrepresentation of the FN in the National Assembly. For instance, the FN won no seats out of 577 in the 2002 elections, despite receiving 11.3% of votes in the first round, as no FN candidates won a first-round majority and few even qualified (either by winning at least 12.5% of the local vote with 25% turnout or by being one of the top two finishers with less) to go on to the second round. In the 2002 presidential election, after the Front National candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen unexpectedly defeated Lionel Jospin in the first round, the traditionally ideologically-opposed Socialist Party encouraged its voters to vote for Jacques Chirac in the second round, preferring anyone to Le Pen. In 2017, his daughter and party successor Marine Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential election; both the Socialist Party and Republicans encouraged votes for her opponent Emmanuel Macron. * In the Czech Republic, the Communist Party is effectively excluded from any possible coalition because of a strong anti-Communist presence in most political parties, including the Social Democrats. Also a cordon sanitaire was put around the Republicans of Miroslav Sl√°dek, when they were active in the Parliament (1992‚Äì1998). When any of its members was set to speak, other deputies would leave the Chamber of Deputies. * In Estonia and Latvia, \\"Russian-speaking\\" parties (LKS and Harmony in Latvia, and the Constitution Party and Centre Party in Estonia) had been excluded from participation in ruling coalitions at a national level until leadership change. Differing interpretations of the Soviet period from 1940‚Äì1990 and attitudes towards the current Russian government and United Russia are often cited as reasons to conclude coalition talks with other parties, even if said parties are perceived to be on the radical right. The cordon is not absolute; the Centre Party has briefly participated in two coalition governments in 1995 and 2002‚Äì2003. In 2016 J√ºri Ratas of Centre became Prime Minister of Estonia, effectively ending any cordon around the party. * In Spain, groups such as the People's Party, have been sometimes excluded from any government coalition in Catalonia. * In Sweden, the political parties in the Riksdag have adopted a policy of non-cooperation with the Sweden Democrats. However, there have been exceptions where local politicians have supported resolutions from SD. * In Canada, resistance to the formation of coalition governments among left-of- center parties has often been attributed to an unwillingness to be seen as collaborating with the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, which advocates for the independence of Quebec. * In the United Kingdom, the far-right British National Party is completely ostracised by the political mainstream. Prominent politicians, including former Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader David Cameron, have been known to urge electors to vote for candidates from any party except the BNP. The eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party has categorically refused even limited cooperation with the BNP. Although the party has never held more than 60 of the some 22,000 elected positions in local government, it is generally agreed by all parties that the BNP should be excluded from any coalition agreement on those councils where no single party has a majority. When two BNP candidates were elected to the European Parliament at the 2009 election, the UK Government announced that it would provide them both with only the bare minimum level of support, denying them the ready access to officials and information that the other 70 British MEPs received. *In Slovenia liberal, centre-left and left-wing parties led by LM≈† leader and later Prime Minister Marjan ≈†arec declared de facto cordon sanitaire and excluded Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) from coalition negotiations following the 2018 parliamentary election, due to its xenophobic and divisive rhetoric and policy, which was based primarily on the opposition to illegal migrations and the discreditation of political opponents.

Wong Sun-shui, ; March 15, 1914 ‚Äì March 16, 1941) was a flying ace of the Republic of China and was among the original group of over a dozen Chinese-American aviators who volunteered to fly in combat missions for the Chinese Air Force against the Imperial Japanese invasion and occupation  Biography  John Huang Xinrui was born in Huangwu village, a large Chinese- American enclave in Taishan county of Guangdong province. He immigrated to the United States with his mother in 1923 when he was nine years old, joining his father, Huang Jinghu, who had already landed in the United States years before during the Qing Dynasty, and ran businesses that included a small market and a restaurant called the \\"Break Drum Cafe Shop\\" on the corner of 1st and 3rd streets in Los Angeles.http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_wong2.htmtitle=Chinese biplane fighter aces - 'Buffalo' Wong Sun-Shuiwebsite=surfcity.kund.dalnet.se}} Ever so influenced by his father's patriotism and generosity to the revolutionary causes of post-imperial China under Dr. Sun Yat-sen, John Huang had a vision and a filial yearning since a young age \\"to support and serve the country of the motherland\\". Joining Chinese-American aviation club in Los Angeles as a teenager, John Huang began taking flight lessons at the age of 18 in 1932, completing advanced studies and his U.S. pilot's license in 1934. Along with over a dozen other Chinese-American volunteer aviators leaving for military aviation combat duties in China, including Arthur Chin, John Wong Pan-yang, Hazel Ying Lee, Louie Yim-qun, Chan Kee-wong et al, John Huang initially joined the Guangdong provincial air force under Chen Jitang, one of numerous \\"warlord air forces\\" that dotted China before centralizing under the Nationalist Chinese Air Force prior to the outbreak of full-scale war between China and Imperial Japan in 1937. As part of the centralized Chinese Air Force, John \\"Buffalo\\" Huang (a.k.a. John \\"Buffalo\\" Wong), so named due to his \\"stocky\\" physique, was now a Lieutenant and Deputy Commander of the 17th Pursuit Squadron, 3rd Pursuit Group composed of P-26/281 fighters, soon to be stationed at Jurong Airbase, the Nanjing defense sector along with the 28th PS, 5th PG composed primarily of Curtiss Hawk IIs under the command of Captain Chan Kee-wong. On 15 August, 1937, John \\"Buffalo\\" Huang Xinrui and John Wong Pan-yang (the names of these two Chinese-American volunteer aviators often confused with one another) led their squadron of P-26/281 fighters against an incoming raid of IJN Mitsubishi G3M medium-heavy bombers on approach to Jurong-Nanjing; John \\"Buffalo\\" Huang personally shooting down one, sharing in another G3M kill, John Wong Pan-yang himself claiming one, while their squadron mate Lt. Qin Jiazhu (Áß¶ÂÆ∂Êü±) claimed another. Capt. Chan Kee-wong also claimed a G3M in the Nanjing airspace, while Curtiss Hawk III squadrons of the 4th PG under the command of Colonel Gao Zhihang based at Jianqiao Airbase claimed several more; in all the Imperial Japanese raiders lost 26 aircraft of different types in the first three days of aerial combat from defending Chinese fighters 14-16 August, 1937.https://www.warbirdforum.com/cafhist.htm By the end of August/beginning of September, the 28th PS, 5th PG based Jurong Airbase was split into two smaller squadrons, with Capt. Chan Kee-wong leading half of Hawk II pilots to the northern front at the Battle of Taiyuan, and Lt. Art Chin leading the other half to the southern front in Guangdong province, while John Huang Xinrui and John Wong Pan-yang remained stationed at Jurong Airbase to continue support of the Nanjing-Shanghai operations On 19 September, 1937, various Japanese bomber and fighter aircraft, including the highly advanced new Mitsubishi A5M carrier-based fighters raided Nanjing at around 0800; 21 Chinese fighters from Jurong and other airbases around Nanjing rose to engage the raiders. At 0900, Lt. John \\"Buffalo\\" Huang led five P-26/281s against eight enemy fighters, and in the ensuing melee, Lt. Liu Lanqing's (ÂäâËò≠Ê∏Ö) P-26/281 fighter was shot-up and he had to bail out in his parachute; John \\"Buffalo\\" Huang tried to fight off the Japanese pilots who were taking turns at strafing Lt. Liu Lanqing while he tried descending to safety in his parachute over Jiangning District, but was hit and killed in what would amount to a combat war crime by the Japanese pilots; such crimes of which clarified under Article 42 of Protocol I amended to the Geneva Conventions. John \\"Buffalo\\" Huang was then himself shot down, seriously wounded, but bailing out and waiting for the last possible moment to pull his parachute cord to avoid getting strafed under the parachute by the Japanese pilots. While recovering from battle wounds, and with all the spare parts and airworthiness of the remaining Boeing P-26/281 fighters exhausted, as well as the impending Fall of Nanking, John Huang's 17th PS was renewed into the 29th PS with new Gloster Gladiator fighters; he'll go on to score several more victories in this fighter aircraft, including triple-kill against an Aichi D1A dive bomber, a Nakajima A4N fighter and an A5M fighter piloted by PO2c Yukio Miyazato over Guangzhou, all from the fleet aircraft carrier Kaga on 13 April, 1938. As the war between China and the Empire of Japan continued into its fifth year, material support from the U.S. had long waned, and reliance on mutual agreement to fight the Imperial Japanese through the Sino-Soviet Treaty had since became the primary source of material support in China's war of resistance against the Imperial Japan's aggression and occupation. The Chinese Air Force had mostly converted to Soviet-made Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 series of fighter aircraft, and the losses at the Battle of Wuhan and the Battle of South Guangxi had pushed the Chinese hinterland, with the new wartime capital pushed back to Chongqing, and all seaports that previously supplied China's war effort in materials, and very importantly, quality aviation fuel needed for proper fighter aircraft performance, have been cut off. After John Huang's 29th PS transitioned into Polikarpov I-15 fighters, his unit was posted to the defense of Chengdu in Szechuan province. At 0915 hours on 14 March, 1941, John Huang led the initial patrol with his squadron of nine I-15s on high-cover at 7500 feet, his deputy commander Cen Ze-liu led eleven I-15s on an intermediate cover at 7000 feet, while the commander of the 28th PS, 3rd PG, Chou Lin-xu, led another eleven I-15s at the low-cover of 6500 feet on reports of incoming enemy aircraft consisting of ten attack-bombers escorted by twelve A6M \\"Zero\\" fighters, which unbeknownst to the West at the time, was the most advanced air-superiority fighter aircraft in the world at the time. While upon the return leg back to Shuangliu Air Base at 1140 hours, four of John Huang Xinrui's fighters had already dropped out due to mechanical problems, yet he immediately pressed on and engaged when the Japanese Zeroes appeared, but was quickly hit in the head by a round, yet managed to crash land his I-15 in spite of the grievous injury to his head; while he survived for his 27th birthday the following day, he died from the injuries sustained the day after that, on 16 March, 1941. Commanders Cen Ze-liu and Chou Lin-xu led their remaining fighters to battle the Zeroes, and in a string of brutal dogfights lasting from 1140 to 1220 hours, the Chinese pilots fought valiantly against the far superior speed and maneuverability of the Zero fighters, and both commanders Cen and Chou, along with five others pilots, including Jiang Dong- sheng and Lin Heng (brother of renown architect Lin Huiyin) all died in the fierce battle against the Japanese Zeroes.

Ford spent approximately $500,000 on the program, making it the most expensive television program in history up to that time. The show was produced by Leland Hayward, the Tony Award-winning producer whose credits include South Pacific and The Sound of Music. On the morning after the show, The New York Times wrote that Hayward \\"stands on the TV peaks\\" for his \\"consummate accomplishment\\" in putting together the \\"mammoth production . . . with such imagination and showmanship.\\" The costumes were designed by Academy Award- winning costumer designer Irene Sharaff. Scenic supervision was provided by Academy Award-winning art director Richard Day. Lois Long of The New Yorker wrote the commentary for the \\"50 years of fashion\\" segment.

The New York Times wrote that there \\"was no greater delight\\" in the program. Another reviewer called it \\"possibly the greatest singing act that's ever been seen on television.\\" The duet was such a popular sensation that it was promptly released by Decca as a long-playing record. It also included comedy sketches performed by Wally Cox, songs performed by crooners Rudy Vall√©e, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Eddie Fisher, and two dance segments choreographed by Jerome Robbins.

Reception and awards =Contemporary reviews= On the day after the broadcast, Jack Gould of The New York Times opened his review: \\"Terrific! Terrific! That's the only possible way to describe last night's two-hour special show.\\" Gould went on to call it \\"one of the epochal evenings in the entertainment world\\", \\"an evening to be long remembered and treasured\\", and \\"a breathtaking, and nostalgic review of the last half-century done with enormous style, wit and gaiety.\\" Gould closed his review as follows: \\"The Ford Motor Company earned a nation's thanks last night for a grand show . . . Seldom has there been such glorious television.\\" In the Minneapolis Morning Tribune, Will Jones wrote: \\"I felt like applauding a couple of times Monday night during the Ford 50th anniversary TV show. Then I held back, because it's silly to sit there clapping at a TV set. It's really too bad, though, that a TV show can't collect the applause it deserves if it's good enough to make people at home respond that way.\\" In the New York Daily News, Broadway writer Danton Walker took a different view, calling the show \\"a mishmash of oddities\\" and concluding that it was \\"a case of 'too many cooks' and an effort to encompass too much.\\" He did concede that Ethel Merman was \\"her usual superb self\\", called Mary Martin \\"the real star of the show\\", and found Martin's 50 years of fashion review to be \\"a gem, brilliantly conceived and brilliantly performed.\\" In The Indianapolis News, Georgia Gianakos called it \\"a tremendous blend of talent both on and off the stage, and emerged as a masterpiece of television production.\\" In The San Francisco Examiner, Dwight Nelson opined that \\"[e]very sequence was unforgettable\\" and called it \\"the biggest TV show in history\\" and \\"a colossal milestone in TV history, setting a target for a thousand tomorrows.\\" =Sylvania Awards= In December 1953, the Ford 50th Anniversary Show won honored at the 1953 Sylvania Television Awards.

The street runs for about 400m from Kiyomizu-zaka Street (east) to the intersection of Goj≈ç and Higashi ≈åji Streets (west). According to some local opinions, Goj≈çzaka actually begins on the east side of the Goj≈ç ≈åhashi Bridge and from that point it runs all the way to Kiyomizu-zaka Street. Also, at the northeast corner of the intersection of Goj≈ç Street and Yamato ≈åji Street, a stone monument that reads \\"east from here, Goj≈çzaka\\" stands.  History  In the mid Muromachi Period, what would become the famous pottery style of Kiyomizu ware was born in the area. By the year 1643 (Edo Period) the name of Kiyomizu- yaki was established and the pottery industry began to flourish in the surroundings. During WWII, ceramic grenades (Type 4 grenade) and ceramic fuel tanks for rockets were produced using the kilns of the local pottery businesses. In the decade of the 1960s, the pollution from the smoke of the Noborigama kilns (climbing kilns) used around the street became a problem and as a result, the old style kilns were eventually replaced with electric and gas devices.  Present day  Kiyomizu ware continues to be produced and sold in the area, being a popular spot for shopping and for learning about this traditional craft, which attracts both local residents and tourists. There are also shops offering Nishijin-ori textiles and folding fans, as well as art galleries located in the vicinity. Although most of the Noborigama kilns (climbing kilns) of the area were removed, there are still at least 3 of these left, preserved as important cultural and historical assets.

Ill health led him to chose to live in Ootacamund and he spent considerable time examining local plants, and making collections of specimens, many of which were deposited in Jena where his cousin J.C. Zenker published a few descriptions but died too early to produce a more complete work. Several plant species have been named after Schmid including the fossil trees Peuce schmidiana and Mesembrioxylon schmidianum from near Pondicherry.  Biography  Schmid was the son of Rudolf Ludwig, a deacon and pastor at W√∂llnitz and later a preacher in Sulzbach near Apolda in 1796. Schmid's mother died in 1806 and his father remarried. After being schooled at Lobeda and Sulzbach, he was taught in Jena by Carl Christian Schmid, and studed classical languages as well as botany, with lectures by August Batsch. From 1807 to 1809 he studied theology at the University of Jena and then became a private tutor to the von Clermont family at Vaals near Aachen. In 1811 he became a teacher of languages at Homburg and became interested in Sanskrit. He was posted pastor in Trarbach and later became a tutor to Karl Friedrich Reinhard. From 1814 he began to study Arabic and Armenian in Paris but had to leave in 1815 when Napoleon returned from Elba and then spent time in Karl Friedrich Reinhard's Falkenlust estate. A younger brother, Deocar, who sought to become a missionary asked the elder to accompany him on travel and went to London in 1816. He too joined as a missionary and on April 11, 1817, he left for Madras, arriving on August 4th. Schmid was posted to Palayamkottai in 1819 and then went to the Nilgiris in May 1831 followed by Mayavaram from July 1834. He preached in English and Tamil. After a brief visit back to Jena in July 1837 he returned to India with a number of plant specimens which went to the Jena Botanical Garden. Poor health made him seek to live in the Nilgiri hills and as a non-British resident he had to seek permission from the British government which granted him permission to live in the Nilgiris. He spent a lot of his time on botanical studies and neglected missionary activity. Along with his wife who ran a school of the Church Missionary Society in the Nilgiris and lived there periodically from 1830 to 1836 and more permanently after returning from Europe in 1845 (which included hydropathy treatments at Almenau in 1941). He died at Calicut. = Botany and other works = Schmid corresponded with botanists in India as well as in Europe. In the Madras Journal of Literature and Science he wrote on the benefits of botanical pursuits and recommended it as a pastime - \\"The man who loves Botany for its own sake, knows not the feelings of envy, jealousy and rivalship, nor is he dependent for happiness on situations and scenes that favour their growth.\\" He sought to supply plant specimens to European collectors and wrote to Sir William Hooker that he was interested in starting a botanical garden in the Nilgiris to see how European plants \\"changed their forms and appeared as new species in the hill climate.\\" Hooker supplied him with seeds. The contemporary Scottish botanist Robert Wight described and named Dichrocephala schmidii after Schmid and was also inspired to publish his own notes on the plants of the Nilgiris after some of the plants collected by Schmid were described by his cousin Jonathan Carl Zenker in 1835. These included the ferns Aspidium anomophyllum (Dryopteridaceae), Grammitis cuspidata (Polypodiaceae) and Adiantum cycloides (Pteridaceae) apart from Ophioglossum schmidii described by Kunze. Samples of fossil wood that Schmid collected from Thiruvakkarai was described by Mathias Schleiden and E.E. Schmid of Jena who identified an angiosperm Peuce schmidiana and a conifer Mesembrioxylon schmidianum. Schmid also took an interest in philology and was especially interested in the Toda language. He incorrectly estimated that two thirds of the Toda vocabulary were derived from Tamil. He also espoused fantastic ideas on Odin being related to the Buddha through the similarity of the word for Wednesday to that used in Tamil. He also published books on English Orthoepy or Pronouncing Spelling Book, translations of Baxter's Saints' Rest, and First Books of Thomas a Kempis.

The writer criticises the meaningless tradition linked to funeral rites and the artificial character of professional mourners in the caste ridden society with humor and pathos. \\"Professional Mourners\\" is part of the published book, The Big Girl & Other Stories. Background Alagu Subramaniam‚Äôs \\"Professional Mourners\\" portrays an episode from a funeral in a Tamil village in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. A disaster is committed by a self-important man from an affluent Tamil family who tries to announce his family pride to the world at the expense of two poor women who are just in the middle of mourning their own mother. The story revolves around the lives of mourners at that time period. The poor women do not have any say and are deprived of expressing their grief and sorrow for their mother. The man from the upper caste forces down his decisions on these mourners, and the poor women have no choice. They are even forced and dragged along, to weep for somebody of the upper caste. Plot The story begins with the death of speaker‚Äôs grandmother late night on Saturday. A big crowd of relatives and villagers gathered in front of the house. At the same time the self styled master of ceremonies get the readers‚Äô attention. The writer introduced the narrator‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs character as a teacher of small school and a trifle mad. He is the person who arranged the whole ceremony. It seems that he is a domineering character without pity and a caricature of his caste and class. Apart from all the tasks at the funeral house the narrator‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs concentration goes for professional mourners. The fact that he rushed out to seek the mourners makes the narrator as well as the readers become more anxious. The master became more furious and at the same time he became a ridiculous figure. The way he seeks mourners to respect his aunt‚Äôs death makes the readers laugh at him. It is a feudal society where powerful people get the maximum use of low class poor people. Most of the time low class associates with poverty, illiteracy and servility. The story depicts the caste and class as a rigid inhuman system. For example the uncle upbraided the fishermen who were getting ready to go to sea for not coming to respect his aunt. For him the poor fishermen were ‚Äòstupid rascals‚Äô and ‚Äòlow-minded fellows.‚Äô Than letting them to find something to feed themselves, for him it is more important them to be presented at the funeral. Next he strode to the area where mourners lived. Due to caste norms they have lost their rights for private grief/genuine grief. The mourners were thus obliged by their society to perform an act to which they were assigned irrespective of what their own grief was. Their master also physically abuses the two sisters, this shows the physical display of power. There is a clear example of social exploitation of the underprivileged when the sisters are forced to attend the ceremony according to the orders of their master while their own mother lays dead at their place. The task they do has become a social ritual in their caste ridden society. They mourn without a grief. And at the same time they are unable to be present at their mother‚Äôs funeral and it becomes more pathetic. It is ludicrous, absurd and ridiculous and it brings the story into a satirical level. Furthermore we are informed the high class people - ‚ÄòLawyer friends‚Äô, ‚ÄòPolice Magistrate‚Äô - who are about to come for the funeral. ::‚ÄúWhat will the people say?‚Äù In the story the uncle thought only of the ‚Äòstatus‚Äô of the family, which according to him would be reflected by the number of mourners. The next important thing is that the way that the mourners perform their task and it was what expected from them. They repeated the words and phrases from the grieving relatives and made a big outcry. They worked in unison. They picked a nice theme for their outcry which is about the grandson who came from Malaya. ::‚ÄúYour grandson has come, wake up my beloved!‚Äù At the same time the educated people of the family are more considerate and sympathetic when they got to know the mother of two mourners passed away as they sympathized the mourners, paid them and asked them to leave.

He held citizenship in that country. In an interview with a departmental officer, he claimed as follows: Red Guards in Tian'anmen Square, 1966 Chan had been a member of the Red Guards, and supported Chairman Mao. He later came to disagree with Mao's ideas, and joined a political faction within the Red Guards opposed to Mao. After their struggle for power was unsuccessful, the faction's members were questioned by Police. This resulted in him being detained for two weeks in 1968 at a police station. His name was locally displayed in public as a person opposed to the state. He was assessed as a counter-revolutionary and exiled from his local area.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 5 Authorities had also discriminated against him and his family for his father's membership with the Kuomintang. He was free to move around where he had been sent, but couldn't return to his home village or travel without written permits. He was detained three times between 1972 and 73 attempting to escape from his place of exile. In 1974 he escaped to Macau where his father had arranged residency and identity documents. He then stowed away on a ship to Hong Kong where he resided illegally. He was deported to Macau, and returned to Hong Kong; before unlawfully entering Australia in August 1980. In 1982 Chan applied for a visa by section 6A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Subsection (I)(c) allowed for visas to be granted to people who:Note: An additional requirement of the act was ss(I)(c)(a) that an applicant be the holder of a temporary visa. There was a minor controversy about this requirement as it applied to Chan; but ultimately he was found to meet this requirement by the High Court. It is arguably not a notable legal issue of the case. ... (b) met the status of Refugee under two relevant international agreements. These agreements were the 1951 Refugee Convention, and the 1967 Status of Refugees protocol.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 2 Relevantly under those agreements, a refugee was a person who 'owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ... political opinion, is outside the country of their nationality'.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 3 Chan's initial application for refugee status in accordance with his visa application; was unanimously rejected by the relevant committee. A review was made, which also determined he was not a refugee. Due to legal doubts, his application was again reconsidered. Chan was interviewed for this purpose by a departmental officer in June 1986. The committee reexamined him, and repeated their unanimous recommendation that his refugee status ought not be recognized. In August 1986 a Ministerial delegate reviewed that recommendation, and found that Chan was not a refugee under the convention.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 10 At interview, the applicant was questioned about the relevance of his experiences in the 1960s to contemporary China. He said he knew the authorities still paid attention to him. They opened letters to his family, and questioned them as to his whereabouts. He said he feared imprisonment in China.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 10 Years earlier he had expressed (although later retracted), that if he had to be deported, he would rather it be to mainland China than Hong Kong or Macau. He was questioned about this statement at interview. His explanation was that he'd thought upon arrival he would face imprisonment in those places, followed thereafter by a deportation to the mainland.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 9 When his application for a visa was rejected in April 1987, the delegate wrote that: 169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 15 > 'I considered that the Applicant had no real political profile in the PRC > ... he was unable to convey in detail his claimed political differences with > the current regime in the PRC, nor provide any credible explanations that > his internal exile and periods of detention were related to any political > activities on his behalf. I accepted that he may have been discriminated > against to a limited degree due to the apparent perception the local > authorities had of his family, but I considered that this did not amount to > persecution within the terms of the Convention. I accepted the Committee > members' views that while he may be the subject of some attention having > escaped from the area where he was assigned in the PRC, any such attention > would not constitute a basis for a well-founded fear of persecution. I also > noted that his original preference if made to leave Australia was to return > to the PRC, a statement not likely to be made by someone with a well-founded > fear of persecution in that country. Although I note his latest preference > of return to Macau (within guarantees), I consider it inconsistent with a > well-founded fear that he would not have at all times considered the > suggested alternatives of Hong Kong or Macau as preferable to his country of > citizenship. I concluded that the Applicant did not have a well-founded fear > of persecution should he be returned to the PRC Accordingly, I determined he > was not a refugee within the meaning of the Convention and Protocol' A consequence of Chan's application being rejected by the delegate was that his family's visas would also be cancelled. Chan had been residing in Australia with his wife and young child.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 1 Keely J overturned the decision at appeal on an ADJRA ground that the minister's decision was unreasonable.Note: Section 5 of the ADJRA On appeal the Full Federal Court set aside Keely J's decision and restored that of the delegate. Chan then appealed to the High Court.  Judgement  Chan's case was that three aspects of the delegate's reasons were unreasonable;169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 19 # That Chan's exile and subsequent detention, didn't amount to persecution under the convention. # That the authorities subjecting Chan to \\"some attention\\" for escaping his place of exile, didn't provide a basis for a well-founded fear of persecution. # That there was no well-founded fear of persecution because Chan had stated his original preference, if deported, was to go back to China. In five separate judgements, each Justice allowed Chan's appeal. Each found on the evidence that the Minister had acted unreasonably. = Justice McHugh = McHugh observed that international common law courts have given different interpretations to the term 'well founded fear' under the convention and protocol. He noted US decisions holding that a 'well-founded fear' may be established, even if persecution is unlikely. The US Justices had remarked that even a low chance, like a 10 percent chance that persecution would occur, was enough.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 35 He then found that 'if there is a real chance that the applicant will be persecuted, his fear should be characterised as \\"well founded\\" for convention purposes'. Obviously though, he noted, 'far fetched possibilities' of persecution would be excluded. He then discussed the scope and contents of the word 'persecuted' under the convention and protocol.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 36 He noted that delegates finding that Chan had 'been discriminated against to a limited degree' due to political perceptions. The delegate said that 'this did not amount to persecution under the convention'. McHugh found this statement to be unreasonable, as the discrimination had involved Chan being exiled for six years. McHugh held 'exile for such a lengthy period for (a political) reason would be a serious invasion of the appellant's freedom and would constitute \\"persecution\\" within the Convention'.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 40 Turning to the second appeal point; McHugh noted it wasn't clear what the delegate had meant by 'some attention'. Regardless, he found it unreasonable for the delegate to have held Chan's fear of further exile or detention as not well founded. Chan was identified with counter-revolutionary political opinion and had previously been exiled for it. Authorities had maintained an interest in Chan. On the evidence, McHugh found; exile for an indeterminate period, or imprisonment of up to two years 'must be regarded as having a real chance of occuring'. Therefore McHugh found the delegate's reasons were in error and couldn't be supported 'on any reasonable basis'.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 42 Turning to third reason, McHugh found; > 'the appellant's preference was not inconsistent with a well-founded fear of > persecution in China if, as he asserted, he would be sent back to China in > any event, perhaps after being imprisoned in Macau or Hong Kong. There was > no evidence repudiating this assertion. Hence, the delegate could not > reasonably find that the appellant's preference for a return to China was > inconsistent with a well-founded fear'.169 CLR 379, McHugh para. 43 The respondent was ordered to pay costs, and the decision on Chan's visa was remitted to the Minister for reconsideration.  Significance  Chan has been frequently cited in Australian courts for the legal tests associated with refugee findings. It is authority for the High Court's view that under the convention; a finding that a person has a 'well founded fear' of persecution, need only be satisfied by there being a 'real chance' they will suffer that harm. Chan's legal test is sometimes referred to in shorthand as the 'real chance' test. CCT17 v Minister for Immigration [2020] FCCA 1916, at para. 11 It is the most often cited legal test of the High Court, according to LawCite. The frequency with which Chan has been cited, may be due to the high number of written Tribunal decisions that have been generated by decisions on refugee status at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and its predecessor bodies.

He is a full professor at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at Leibniz University, where he founded the Riemann Center for Geometry and Physics. Lechtenfeld‚Äôs research is focused on string theory, gauge theory and integrable models. He has published over 200 research papers on mathematical physics, classical and quantum field theory, gravitation, supersymmetry and integrable many-body systems. Lechtenfeld has a second career in amateur sports. He finished 25 marathons and numerous triathlons (including 11 ironman races) and twice competed in the Ironman World Championship at Hawai'i.  Education  Lechtenfeld was a student of physics and mathematics at University of Bonn. He completed his Diploma degree in 1982 and received his doctoral degree in 1984 from the University.  Career  After his Ph.D., Lechtenfeld became a Research Fellow at CERN from 1985 till 1987. Lechtenfeld then took up the position of a Research Associate at City College of New York till 1990. For the subsequent two years, he was a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1992, he moved from the US back to Germany and was appointed by the University of Hannover (later renamed Leibniz University) as a Professor of Theoretical Physics. Lechtenfeld also held administrative appointments. He served as the founding dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the university from 2005 till 2007. Between 2007 and 2014, Lechtenfeld was responsible for the Research Area \\"Space-Time\\" as a PI at the Cluster of Excellence QUEST. From 2011 till 2018, he headed the Riemann Center for Geometry and Physics. Since 1995 he runs the annual Saalburg Summer School on Foundations and New Methods in Theoretical Physics.  Research  Lechtenfeld has worked on mathematical physics, classical and quantum field theory, gravitation, supersymmetry and integrable many-body systems. A significant part of his research is focused on string theory. = Finite groups, mean fields, and supersymmetry = Lechtenfeld started his research in the early 1980s, with the representation theory of finite subgroups of SU(n). After obtaining his physics degree for introducing optimized mean fields for atoms, he discovered during his PhD a systematic construction of the Nicolai map for globally supersymmetric field theories. This allowed for its perturbative diagrammatic computation and established the existence of stochastic variables in certain theories. 35 years later, Lechtenfeld returned to the Nicolai map for supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills theory with an extension to all critical dimensions and an explicit complete evaluation to third order in the coupling. = String theory = Lechtenfeld has conducted significant research in string theory; after his Ph.D. he started working on this and related research areas in the second half of the 1980s. As a postdoc at CERN, Lechtenfeld developed conformal field methods for the computation of superstring scattering amplitudes, refining the bosonized vertex operator construction and applying it to four- and six-fermion scattering. After moving to the City College of New York, he pushed this approach to higher loops, including bosonization on higher-genus Riemann surfaces. In particular, he found a new fermionic representation of beta-gamma systems by employing Fay's trisecant identity. He also developed off-shell conformal methods for superstring field theory. Lechtenfeld then worked on random matrix models of two-dimensional quantum gravity, a topic he continued during his membership at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He applied the semiclassical approach to finite-N matrix models and derived an integral equation for the classical eigenvalue density. After accepting a full professorship in Hannover, Lechtenfeld focused his research to N=2 fermionic strings in 2+2 spacetime at tree and loop level. He worked out its path-integral quantization, BRST cohomology, nonlocal hidden symmetries and resulting stringy extensions of selfdual Yang‚ÄìMills theory and gravity. During the early 2000s, Lechtenfeld researched on superstring field theory, twistor string theory, topological and pure-spinor strings. He obtained exact solutions to Berkovits‚Äô string field theory and combined the Lorentz invariant N=2 string field theory with the twistor description of selfdual Yang‚ÄìMills theory. Between 2007 and 2014, Lechtenfeld investigated heterotic string compactifications with fluxes and fermionic condensates on nearly K√§hler, G2 and Sasakian manifolds, to order Œ±‚Äô, finding families of non-supersymmetric string vacua. = Baryon number violation, hairy black holes, Gribov problem = In 1990, Lechtenfeld authored an article studying baryon number violation in the Standard Model at high temperature. His research indicated a negligible baryon number violation in high energy scattering. Between 1992 and 1996, Lechtenfeld occasionally worked on black holes with minimally coupled scalar hair in two and four dimensions. He constructed a partially analytic and a fully analytic solution representing deformations of the Schwarzschild black hole by a self-interacting scalar field; albeit violating the dominant energy condition. He also developed in general the linear perturbation theory for the stability of such backgrounds. In 2013, Lechtenfeld found an explicit form for the Jacobian of arbitrary field-dependent BRST transformations in Yang‚ÄìMills theory. He showed that such transformations amount to a change of gauge and presented a formula for the BRST transformation producing any desired gauging. In an application to the Gribov copy problem, the Gribov‚ÄìZwanziger model was generalized beyond the Landau gauge. = Noncommutative field theory = From 2001, Lechtenfeld conducted a decade-long analysis of Moyal-deformed field theories, with emphasis on its classical solutions such as noncommutative solitons, waves, vortices, baby Skyrmions, monopoles and instantons. In particular, the construction of multi-solitons in Ward‚Äôs modified sigma model and in the sine-Gordon model demonstrated the compatibility of Moyal deformations and integrability. Lechtenfeld extended the analysis to supersymmetric models with non-anticommutative solitons and to the moduli- space (or adiabatic) dynamics of Moyal-deformed abelian sigma-model solitons. He adapted the dressing, splitting and ADHM approaches to constructing noncommutative instantons and solved the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert problem for Moyal- deformed Wu‚ÄìYang, Dirac and BPS monopoles. = Integrable many-body systems = In 2003, Lechtenfeld started a new research line with extended supersymmetric mechanics and integrable many-body systems of Calogero‚ÄìMoser type. He related N=4 superconformal multi-particle quantum mechanics to the celebrated WDVV equations and constructed a variety of novel models with D(2,1;Œ±) superconformal invariance, some with extra spin variables. He reduced integrable superconformal mechanics to its angular sector and found the hidden symmetries and conserved charges of the latter. For the quantum angular Calogero‚ÄìMoser models Lechtenfeld calculated the energy spectra and eigenstates, the conserved charges and intertwiners, and the admissible PT deformations. For the rational and trigonometric models he also described the algebra of the conserved charges and revealed a nonlinear supersymmetry for integral couplings. In 2017 he proposed a curved-space generalization of the WDVV equations and the related N=4 supersymmetric mechanics. In 2018, Lechtenfeld formulated Calogero‚ÄìMoser models with an arbitrary number of supersymmetries by increasing the number of fermionic degrees of freedom to the square of the bosonic ones. = Yang‚ÄìMills fields in higher dimensions and electromagnetic knots = In 2006 Lechtenfeld began investigating the equivariant coset-space dimensional reduction of Yang‚ÄìMills theories, which led to new types of quiver gauge theory and its vortex solutions. He constructed instanton solutions on coset manifolds and cones thereover with special holonomy and extended them to flux vacua of the heterotic string. After 2014 adiabatic limits of Yang‚ÄìMills theory on warped product spaces became a subject of Lechtenfeld‚Äôs research. He showed that in certain infrared limits the moduli-space approximation leads to Skyrme or Faddeev or even superstring sigma models. In 2017, Lechtenfeld reconstructed exact finite- action Yang‚ÄìMills solutions on four-dimensional de Sitter and anti de Sitter spaces by reducing the problem to the Newtonian mechanics of a particle moving in R^3 subject to a quartic potential. The discovery of Abelian configurations led Lechtenfeld to a novel construction method for all rational vacuum Maxwell solutions (so-called electromagnetic knots) in Minkowski space, which exploits a hidden O(4) symmetry.

In 1943, following capture and more than two months of interrogation-torture sessions, she faced a session of the special \\"People's Court\\" at Klagenfurt on 9 April 1943. She was one of a batch of twenty-six captured partisans convicted: thirteen were sentenced to death: the other twelve executed were all men. Life Maria ≈Ωupanc was born one of her parents' (at least) four children in Ebriach, a small village in the rural Eisenkappel-Vellach administrative district. The region was one of remote mountain villages in which Slovene dialects predominated, but in the 1920 Carinthian plebiscite pragmatic considerations of perceived economic advantage had trumped nationalistic separatism, and throughout her childhood the district had remained part of the Austrian province of Carinthia, rather than joining up with Yugoslavia, across the mountains. Georg and Barbara ≈Ωupanc, her parents, were peasant farmers. With her brothers, Ivan and Miha ≈Ωupanc she was involved in political activism under the leadership of Valentin Kordesch, on behalf of the Communist Party, which had been illegal since an emergency decree dated May 1933, issued by the Austrofascist government of Chancellor Dollfuss. Maria ≈Ωupanc was still young when she married Max Olip from the adjacent district of Zell Pfarre / Sele Fara. He was a nephew of Thomas Olip (1884‚Äì1943), who would emerge as a leader of Slovene partisan resistance, and who later died on the guillotine at the same Vienna execution facility and on the same day as Maria Olip herself. The political context changed in 1938 when the hitherto independent Federal State of Austria was integrated into Germany, which ushered in a more uncompromising approach to political opposition by the security services. The \\"Anschluss\\" also made unavoidable - if it was not already unavoidable - national involvement in the forthcoming war, which broke out in September 1939. Maria Olip's home region was now on the mountainous southern frontier of an enlarged and increasingly embattled enlarged German state. Between 1941 and 1943 that part of Slovenia, directly to the south of Austrian Carinthia was under German military occupation. German occupation was resisted by Slovene partisans from north of the border who would have classified themselves as (Slovene speaking) Austrian/German citizens. Maria Olip worked as an \\"underground messenger\\" for her brother, Ivan ≈Ωupanc, who had been a founder of the Slovene partisan movement in Carinthia. Another of her brothers, Miha ≈Ωupanc, was also an active member of the Slovene resistance partisans, and it was during a meeting at his remote small-holding that she reported how she was now in contact not just with longstanding \\"old\\" comrades, but had been establishing links with a succession of new comrades. She had, in particular, been striking up conversations with off-duty German soldiers who came to take their holidays in the local mountain valleys, in order to try and win them over to join with the Slovene partisans. Even more dangerously, at the instigation of her resistance comrade Franz Weinzierl she had sent a letter to a man called Johann Rozmann in the provincial capital Klagenfurt, inviting him to work with the partisans. She helped Franc Pasterk,, who was in Klagenfurt on home leave from the army, to flee to the partisans in Upper Carniola. In September 1942, in the aftermath of a battle against the Second Slovenian Kokra battalion, the Germans came across a \\"≈Ωupanc letter\\" which included mention of a \\"sick sister\\", which appeared to be a coded reference to a female partisan group member. From this - probably in combination with other clues they had already acquired - they were able to infer that Maria Olip was involved in the \\"Osvobodilna fronta\\" anti-fascist liberation movement. On 11 November 1942 two apparent partisans, Helmut Sovetz und Felix Koprivnik, turned up at the \\"Golopkeusche\\" (farmstead) on the Waschnigberg (local mountain). Sovetz befriended Maria Olip who took him to be a forestry worker with communist tendencies, and told him about an upcoming meeting of local partisans. In the evening she arrived at the meeting with the two men. The participants were then taken by surprise when a gang of Nazi paramilitaries (SS). Olip's trust had clearly been betrayed by two government spies. As the wounded comrades were driven away she was able to jump out of the truck and disappear into the bushes; but the next day, while making her way back to Eisenkappel, she was found and recaptured by a paramilitary patrol. Some time later a comrade called Maria Haller spotted her on \\"shower day\\" in the city jail at Klagenfurt, and reported back that her entire body was covered with wounds, caused by the torture to which she had been subjected. It is not entirely clear what information her interrogators extracted from her, but at the subsequent trial in which she was included the court presumabnly relied on their testimony when it determined that she was a \\"fanatical agitator and hater\\" (\\"fanatische Hasserin und Hetzerin\\") and referred to her as the \\"shotgun woman\\" (\\"Flintenweib\\"). For more than two months she was subjected to a programme of torture and interrogation, during the course of which several of her teeth were knocked out. In the Gestapo prison she also repeatedly underwent the unsettling experience of seeing other prisoners being carried out after their interrogation-torture sessions. Confessions allegedly extracted from her led to a number of further arrests. However, since the interrogations were carried out in German, a language of which Olip understood very little, the record of the interrogations contains many inaccuracies and distortions. Shortly before the trial a lengthy indictment was presented to her, and she refuted much of what she was recorded as having said. On 9 April 1943 Maria Olip faced the special \\"People's Court\\" at Klagenfurt. Ominously, for those familiar with his judicial record, the presiding judge was Roland Freisler. She was the only woman sentenced to death. Thirteen female co- defendants were sentenced to prison terms of between nine months and eight years.. The executions took place on 29 April 1943 at the National Execution Facility at the District Court Complex in Vienna. After the war the remains of Maria Olip's body were exhumed and sent to Zell Pfarre for reburial.

Goda later appears as one of the main characters in the sixth installment of the series, Yakuza: Dead Souls, which does not follow the series' canon and is set in an alternate timeline where Goda survives his wounds at the end of Yakuza 2. Goda is most recently featured as the protagonist of a prequel story arc in Ryu ga Gotoku ONLINE (Èæç„ÅåÂ¶Ç„Åè ONLINE, lit. \\"Like A Dragon ONLINE\\"), a freemium collectible card game spin-off exclusive to Japan. Within the series, Goda is the patriarch of the Go-Ryu Family, a subsidiary organized crime family of the Omi Alliance, the dominant yakuza association based in Osaka. Ryuji is the adopted son of Jin Goda, chairman of the Omi Alliance, and is often referred to as the due to the tattoo of a golden yellow dragon on his back. He expressed dissatisfaction towards the sobriquet however, as he believes that there could only be \\"one true dragon\\" in Japan; to this end he seeks to defeat series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, who is presented as his premier rival. Goda is voiced by Masami Iwasaki in all media. Goda has received a positive reception. The character's popularity in Japan has seen the character being periodically re-introduced into the franchise in spite of his death in Yakuza 2 and its remake. Many reviewers called Goda the best villain of the franchise and consider the character's depiction in Yakuza 2 and its remake to be a series highlight. Creation and development Goda's concept as a character originated from the developers' desire to create an overwhelmingly powerful antagonist that makes players think that they may not be able to win in terms of raw power, strength, and organizational strength. His personality has been described by the head writer of ONLINE Kazunobu Takeuchi as arrogant and violent, and an enigma as he is the type of person who does not really disclose his true feelings. In his first appearance, Goda carries a Japanese sword which he occasionally uses as a weapon, and is known for his dragon tattoo; the series' developers have used tattoos to provide characterization or highlight the relationship between friends or enemies throughout the franchise, and are designed by Kazuaki Kitamura, a Japanese tattoo artist better known as Horitomo. The character is redesigned for Dead Souls, where his right arm has been replaced by metal prosthetic, and is later outfitted with a portable gatling gun. The segment of ONLINE which details Goda's life before he became the leader of the Go-Ryu Clan was released in March 2020. The character's popularity with the franchise's Japanese fanbase has encouraged the developers to present Goda in recurring appearances well after his canonical demise during the events of Yakuza 2. When Goda was announced as the fourth and final playable character for Dead Souls on August 18, 2010, Yakuza producer Toshihiro Nagoshi acknowledged the demand for further appearances for the character, noting his \\"manly, brawny\\" appeal as a \\"rival character who gives off a powerful aura\\" and that his story arc would follow the events of Yakuza 2. At the 2019 Tokyo Game Show, Goda's actor Iwasaki stated in a Q&A; session that he rarely gets to play the characters he wants to play in the voice acting industry, but he managed to land the role of Ryuji Goda whom he really wanted to play after having auditioned for it, and is thus very fond of the character. In an interview conducted by 4gamer staff with Renji Ishibashi, the voice actor of an elderly takoyaki cook who takes in Goda as an apprentice and serves as his father figure in Dead Souls, he explained that Goda's arc explores how he deals with the conflicting identities of his past and present, as a former criminal who now carries on a legitimate trade as a tradesperson, and what kind of future would he end up with. Ishibashi said one of the most important things taught by Goda's mentor, who is only ever referred to as \\"Oyassan\\" („Åä„ÇÑ„Å£„Åï„Çì, an honorific title for \\"father\\") and knows more then what he lets on about Goda's history, is how to dispatch a live octopus in one blow. He opined that it may seem cruel at first, but suggested that one's opponent would needlessly suffer if they are not finished off in the most efficient manner possible, and that what Goda learns from his master is in fact an act of compassion. Ishibashi suggested that while Goda during his youth is not the same violent crime boss he eventually becomes, a part of his nature embraced the gangster role because it felt right, noting that the events of the game tests Goda's resolve and reveals his inner conflict as he is pulled back into the criminal underworld which he no longer wants to be involved in. He considered Goda's relationship with his mentor as a character study of two men who are both trying to move on from a difficult past and the highlight of Goda's story arc, being an example of a positive bond between men in spite of its sad conclusion. On the developers' decision to shift the narrative of ONLINE away from current series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga to Goda as of March 2020, Takeuchi explained in an interview with Famitsu that he wanted to explore the story of a protagonist who is very different in temperament, and who is so strong he could effortlessly plough through his enemies. While other characters such as Shun Akiyama and Yoshitaka Mine were considered as candidates to succeed Kasuga, Takeuchi ultimately decided on Goda as he is a fan favorite whom he already has ideas for, and that the previous ONLINE sub story event involving the character was very well received, noting that the game itself was conceived as a form of fan service for longtime fans who might want to see more of Goda's adventures. At a panel event for ONLINE at the Tokyo Game Show 2019, panel members drew attention to the character's enduring popularity and his status as Kiryu's most impressive rival in the series as the reason for his renewed prominence, and noted that there are further opportunities to explore the character's backstory as he has not been featured much in franchise media outside of Dead Souls. Appearances In Yakuza 2, Goda's initial introduction sees him conspiring with a gangster over telephone to create chaos in Kamuroch≈ç (Á•ûÂÆ§Áî∫), a fictionalized version of the real life Kabukich≈ç district in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Kiryu encounters Goda for the first time in a cabaret establishment at S≈çtenbori (ËíºÂ§©Â†Ä), based on Osaka's real-life D≈çtonbori entertainment district, where he is drinking with his henchmen, and later lashes out and assaults one of them after he calls Goda the \\"Dragon of Kansai\\". Goda stages a coup when Kiryu meets his father Jin Goda at the Omi Alliance headquarters and attempts to broker a peace deal, and kidnaps his father and Daigo Dojima, wanting to start a war between the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance. It is later revealed that Goda is the son of the Jingweon boss and his wife Suyeon, and that Kaoru is his half-sister. He wants revenge against Tojo Clan for the massacre of the Jingweon 25 years; to accomplish this, he collaborates with the Jingweon to destroy the Tojo and the city they operate in, though later states he hates associating with the Jingweon and has no interest in their agenda. At the end of the game, Kiryu and Goda fight on the top of the unfinished Kamurocho Hills. After his defeat, and the killing of Jin and Terada, he gets up and charges Takashima with a gun. Goda is shot multiple times before finally shooting Takashima in the head. He and Kiryu then have a final showdown, explaining to the protesting Sayama that both he and Kiryu are going to die anyway, either by succumbing to their wounds or the bomb exploding, which ends with a cross-counter. He then dies in Kaoru's arms. In the zombie-oriented spinoff Yakuza: Dead Souls, which follows an alternate timeline, Goda has been expelled from the Omi Alliance after losing his fight with Kiryu, and drifts around before settling down at a takoyaki shop as an apprentice to its cantankerous owner. He was set to succeed the owner as proprietor of the business, before returning to Kamurocho during the zombie outbreak, and discovers that the Omi Alliance is involved with the outbreak's origins. An adolescent Goda makes a brief appearance in Yakuza 0 as part of an optional sub story encounter with protagonist Goro Majima, where he starts fights with high school students and steals their pants as the \\"Bontan Hunter\\". Majima would encounter Goda years later in Yakuza Kiwami 2, where Goda is impressed by Majima's integrity after he announced the disbandment of the Majima Family as atonement to appease the strained relations between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance. In other media Ryuji Goda is portrayed by D2 band member Sho Jinnai for the stage play adaptation of the first Yakuza game. Directed by Takahiro Tamura, the stage play ran with eight performances from April 24 to April 29, 2015, at the Akasaka ACT Theater in Akasaka, Minato Ward in Tokyo, Japan. Goda's inclusion in the play's narrative was not an adaptation of any existing game media as the character does not appear in the first game or its remake; notable original content from the play included a confrontation scene between Goda and Akira Nishikiyama. Ryuji appears as a bonus character in Binary Domain, and in the PSP game Taiko no Tatsujin Portable DX series alongside other Yakuza series protagonists as part of a crossover event. Goda's counterpart in Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin! is Saigo Kichinosuke, the commander of the Satsuma domain's army, whose in-game avatar is identical in appearance to Goda. Reception Ryuji Goda has been very positively received, both as a charismatic villain which contrasts Kiryu's more reserved spirit, and for his character development in the spin-off sequel Dead Souls. Kotaku's Heather Alexandra described him as the glue that binds the disparate elements of Kiwami 2 together. She formed the view that the final battle between Goda and Kiryu is among the series‚Äô finest moments. Jonathan Logan from RPGFan called Goda \\"a dark reflection of Kiryu\\", who possesses \\"layers of complexity and emotional depth that most villains lack\\", noting that his commanding presence sets the ideal standard for villains in the Yakuza series. Kelly Pask from PCGamesN consider Goda a highlight of the series, an unpredictable villain who relishes in causing chaos and violence for the sake of it, and said that \\"it feels like a make or break moment for Kiryu‚Äôs character\\" when they finally collide. Liana Ruppert from Game Informer said that Goda's immense honor and fierce loyalty are his real redeeming qualities, and praised Masami Iwasaki's voice work as inimitable for imparting a sense of gravitas to Goda's characterization. Phil Kollar, also from Game Informer, found Goda's motivation for hunting down undead monsters in Dead Souls as an act of honor and reconciliation interesting, since he had a hand in their creation. Chris Schilling from Eurogamer commented that the depiction of Goda running a takoyaki stall in Dead Souls is an occasion where the series \\"treats something ridiculous in such an earnest manner that it's impossible not to warm to it\\". Conversely, Peter Glagowski from Destructoid said that Kiwami 2 tries to build up Goda as a menacing villain with an interesting backstory, but paradoxically does not afford him adequate screen time; as a result, he found the character to be unconvincing as an \\"ultimate threat\\" to Kiryu. Hayden Dingman from PCWorld agreed that Goda is underutilized, but is nevertheless a fantastic foil to Kiryu. In a 2013 popularity poll, held on the franchise's official website between July 9 to August 8, 2013, Goda was voted the 9th most popular character. In a 2018 poll organized to promote ONLINE, Goda was voted the 6th most popular character. Promotion and merchandise Goda has been subject to various promotional campaigns and merchandise, which often features his signature golden yellow dragon tattoo as a motif or theme. Following the announcement of Goda as the fourth and final playable character for Dead Souls, a large poster of him was erected across the east exits of the Shinjuku branch of Don Quijote, a shop that is featured throughout the series as a tie-in. To promote the Japanese launch of Kiwami 2 for PlayStation 4, in late-2017 series publisher SEGA collaborated with food delivery website Takumen.com to offer character-themed ramen dishes for delivery orders and at select ramen noodle eateries for a limited time period. One of the dishes is a variant of the miso ramen inspired by Goda: the ramen's chashu topping is prepared to resemble Goda's yellow dragon motif in appearance, while the spicy flavour and foamy texture of the ramen broth is supposed to evoke his personality.

It is located about East of the township of Koboko.  Background  According to the Uganda Refugee Response Monitoring Settlement Fact Sheet of June 2018, the Lobule refugee camp was established in September 2013 to host the refugees fleeing from the insurgency in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to the M18 rebels. Lobule refugee camp hosts over 4,600 Congolese refugees from the areas of Turupa, Gombe, Morodu, Gaaki, Lisoka and Pamara in Aru Territory, Ituri province. The settlement has two divisions, zones A and B. The refugees were received at Oraba and Keri reception centres in Kuluba Sub County, Koboko District, before being transferred to Lobule refugee camp.  Healthcare  Refugees and nationals reported facing difficulties regarding transportation to the health facilities, which has discouraged many from seeking treatment FGD - protein feeding program participants emphasized that the insufficient number of health workers in the health centres has led to long waiting lines and delays in receiving treatment.  Education  Education services are weakened by a lack of teachers, inadequate learning facilities and furniture, an absence of feeding programs in the schools, overcrowding leading to high teacher per student ratios and a lack of teaching materials. Schools are few and located far away from the homes of refugess and nationals, which has further led to high dropout rates.  Social services  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, with support from REACH, conducted a Multi- Sector Needs Assessment with the aim to address this information gap by providing evidence-based analysis to inform the Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for 2019-2020. Uganda currently hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa and the third largest in the world. Around 57 percent of the 1.4 million refugees in Uganda live in the northern region, having come from South Sudan and the DR Congo. The proposed road corridor is the lifeline for the host and the refugee population of the districts of Koboko, Yumbe and Moyo of which Lobule refugee settlement is a direct beneficiary.  Water and sanitation  Potable water points are few and located at a long distance from the refugees' area of residence at the camp. This leads to long waiting times and congestion at the water sources as well as fighting between refugees and host communities due to the scarcity of the water. The existing boreholes were reported to be poorly maintained and breaking often with delays in their reparation. Furthermore, the water supply is irregular, with periods of up to one month without water, increasing water scarcity.

According to the image, photo teasers, a concept clip, concept images, track list, an online cover image, and a music video teaser would be revealed on June 24 ‚Äì July 3. On the July 1, the official cover of the single was revealed. The music video teasers were released on July 1 and 2. Composition and lyrics \\"Play\\" was written and produced by VINCENZO, Any Masingga, Fuxxy and Anna Timgren and Changmo. It runs for three minutes and nineteen seconds. The song is a Latin pop with various elements of reggaeton arranged in each section. The guitar sound at the verse is scattered off the beat with an iconic reggae rhythm, warms the space with an acoustic guitar sound and a synthesizer sound that unfolds instantly from the pre-chorus, then a brass section and dembow rhythm with the climax chorus light a heart to everyone with a feast of rhythm.\\". Stone Music said that \\"Play\\" continues the voice of the deep night expressed by the previous single \\"Stay Tonight\\", it contains the story of a more beautiful hot afternoon than the night which blurred the boundary between day and night. After a secret and private moment, the lyrics were filled with bold and striking words like the angle of the midsummer sun. Starting with Remedy, Changmo's rap which presented a new narrative combining the title of Chung Ha's singles was perfectly harmonized to complete a picture as if drawing a pupil. Music video The music video was released on July 6, 2020, and in the music video for the track, Chungha steps into the shoes of a matador to bullfight against a bright red sports car.

XV:24, was written in 1795, during Haydn's second trip to London.Brauner, J√ºrgen: Studien zu den Klaviertrios von Joseph Haydn. W√ºrzburg. 1995 According to Robert Philip, this work is unusual compared with other later piano trios in that it is serious in tone throughout, \\"with almost Beethoven-like earnestness\\". The style of piano writing, with its rich chords, octaves in the bass and lively elaboration in the right hand, was much influenced by the sonorous English pianos Haydn came to appreciate while in London.Philip, Robert. Notes to Haydn, Piano Trios Vol 1, Hyperion CD CDA67719 (2009) The trio is in three movements: 1\\\\. Allegro. A large scale movement full of rhetorically dramatic pauses, changes of mood and unexpected accents. 2\\\\. Andante. A brief and solemn dance, based around an insistent baroque-style dotted rhythm figure. It leads into the finale without a break. 3\\\\. Allegro, ma non dolce. A grave minuet-like movement, but with the triple time rhythm cleverly subverted by two-beat phrases and by the interplay of the instruments. The work was published in October 1795 by the English firm of Longman and Broderip as part of a set of three with the opus number (seldom used today) 73. The other two are No. 39 in G major (Hob. XV:25) and No. 40 in F minor, (Hob. XV:26). All are dedicated to Haydn's friend, the widow Rebecca Schroeter.Robertson, Nicolas.

Doctor's Gate was recorded in 1627 as \\"Docto Talbotes Gate\\", named after Dr John Talbot who is attributed with improving the summit section in the late 15th century and 'gate' is derived from the Scandinavian word for road. The route of Doctor's Gate was investigated in the 1970s by Peter Wroe and Peter Mellor. The present day path across the moors, which is marked on OS maps, was a medieval packhorse route and may deviate about 1km to the north from the actual course of the Roman road on Ashop Moor. Four sections of the Doctor's Gate route are under the stewardship of the National Trust, within its Hope Woodlands property: * Blackley Hey section: trackway through the Woodlands Valley north of Hope between Fulwood Stile Farm and the ford at Upper Ashop. * Heyridge Farm section: path between Ashop Bridge and Oyster Clough. * Lady Clough section: path between Oyster Cough (east of Snake Inn) and the Snake Pass. * Summit section: paved routeway between Snake Pass (A57 road along the old Sheffield to Glossop turnpike from 1821) and just beyond the Pennine Way long-distance footpath.

She had 30, or , high pressure engines, and tubular boilers from Campbell & Son's foundry. Go-a-head left Glasgow on 10 May and sailed to Melbourne, arriving on 2 November. An attempt to sell her failed, so on 2 December 1867 she left Hobson's Bay with a full cargo for Westport (then called Buller). Another 12 days sailing took her to Buller, where she briefly grounded on the North Spit. This time she was advertised by Wellington agents, A. P. Stuart & Co, the sale notice saying she had, \\"a draught of 4 feet of water, will carry 1000 sheep. Highly suited for trading between this and the West Coast.\\" The \\"highly suited\\" and \\"Must be sold, owner leaving the colony\\"claims may not have been true; she used her engines to get from Buller to Wellington, but, \\"finding steam could not be maintained with the bad coals she had on board, she ran for Nelson for better fuel\\". She finally reached Wellington on 4 January 1868. Initially she was to sail for Napier, but additions and repairs, apparently amidst some delay, strife over payments and a failure to sell her, left her lying at Queen's wharf for months. A trial trip to Evans Bay showed the boiler was too small. There was a rumour of her carrying cattle from Whanganui to the West Coast and she was advertised many times, before going with Captain Mundle to Auckland in August.  Initial Routes  During her 19 years in New Zealand waters Go-ahead visited most of the ports around the country. When she was eventually sold to Auckland, the Thames gold rush was on, so Lallah Rookh and Go-ahead started on that route, with Go-ahead taking her first 25 passengers from Auckland on Tuesday 1 September 1868. She went to Bay of lslands on 16 September, it becoming a regular run, until SS Tauranga sank on 23 July 1870 and Go Ahead replaced her on the Tauranga route. In 1875 Go Ahead was reported to have done five return trips for Auckland Steam Packet Co. between Auckland, Gisborne and Napier, four trips between Manukau, New Plymouth and Wanganui, and a round trip to Auckland via Wellington and Napier. In 3 months 12 days she burnt 289 tons of coal to cover , or per mile. Then she visited many more ports, including Raglan in 1876, Napier, Gisborne, Thames, Auckland in 1877, occasionally called at other ports such as Tauranga when in need of shelter on the way, as well as covering for Rotomahana on the Thames run. On 10 January 1878 Auckland Steam Packet Co. sold Go-Ahead for ¬£2500 to what was described as a newly-formed Auckland company.  Incidents  Go Ahead had her own collision problem when she was said to be ‚Äúgoing ahead full speed‚Äù on 3 September 1870 and collided with Ivanhoe not far from the spot where Tauranga sank, near WhangƒÅrei Heads. A Court of Inquiry found both masters at fault; Go Ahead had no forward lookout. There was little damage. In 1877 Go Ahead stranded for a while on the South Spit whilst leaving Gisborne, and at one point was thought to be beyond salvage, not being able to be beached for repairs for about 3 weeks, whilst reports continued to say she was abandoned. A court decided the captain's mistake wasn't sufficient to suspend his certificate and the ship was back on a slipway on Auckland's North Shore, awaiting repairs, by July. Gouk & Cardon's ¬£1400 tender for repair was accepted. At that time she was insured for ¬£4,000. In 1878 she broke down in a storm and had to sail to Onehunga. Next year she broke a propeller. Those incidents maybe prompted her new owners, Johnston & Co, to give her more powerful engines, lengthen and reboiler her in 1879. An 1879 collision with Hura, or Huia, off Ohau Point, again caused only minor damage and, again, both captains were blamed, but their certificates weren't suspended.  Later routes  From 1878 she served Wellington-Napier but also continued to visit Gisborne and Auckland sometimes via Castle Point but also working on the west coast to Whanganui, about a 24-hour trip from Wellington. Occasional visits took Go Ahead as far as Onehunga and also to Waitara and Rangitƒ´kei Port in 1878. Foxton was visited in 1879, and she began serving southern ports at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru and sometimes Kaik≈çura and Lyttelton. After her 1879 repair she was described as almost a new ship and continued to serve Castlepoint, Napier and, after a long absence, Whanganui. For a long time in the 1880s Go-Ahead served Wellington, Dunedin, Whanganui, Napier and ports in between.  Wreck  Her final grounding came in 1887. She went ashore in \\"terribly thick weather\\" at Cape Kidnappers at 2am. James Gunning, a stoker was drowned. The fog was thick enough for Go Ahead to be in the breaking waves before it was known that anything was wrong. She later turned bottom upwards and largely broke up. Her insurance value with Union was ¬£5,500. The wreck inquiry found that Go-Ahead left Wellington for Napier on 18 May at 6pm, passed Cape Turnagain a day later, at 6pm on the 19th, and Blackhead at 9pm. By 1am on Friday 20th 1887 the wind and sea were increasing and Captain Plumley thought he was about six miles north of Cape Kidnappers and considered that Go Ahead was making 8¬Ω to 9 knots. The Court considered that he was guilty of negligent navigation in trying to cut the headland too fine in the foggy weather and suspended his certificate for three months; by September, Captain Plumley was commanding the steamer Wallabi. Banner & Liddle sold the hull and machinery to Mr. J. Hawkins for ¬£13. The Fairy was used to attempt salvage, but with limited success due to poor weather. Another attempt with Bella was made to recover the boiler, but it was still there in 1937. A bell and compass from the ship were recovered and the boiler was said to be still there in 2011.

Description The glabrous and viscid shrub that typically grows to a height of . It has slender branchlets that are often coated in a black powdery substance. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The slender and erect phyllodes have a narrowly linear shape and are usually shallowly incurved. The resinous and pungent pjhyllodes have a length of and a width of and have three obscure nerves per face. It blooms between April and December producing simple and axillary inflorescences with spherical pale yellow coloured flower-heads. Following flowering dark brown seed pods form that are flat and straight with thick straw coloured margins. The pods are around in length and wide and contain hard brown to black coloured seeds with an ovoid shape that are about in length and wide. Taxonomy The shrub was first formally described by the botanist John McConnell Black in 1932 as part of the work Additions to the Flora of South Australia. No. 30 as published in the Transactions and proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. It was reclassified as Racosperma barattense by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then returned to genus Acacia in 2006. It belongs to the Acacia wilhelmiana group. The specific epithet is taken from the name Baratta Station, the pastoral lease where the type specimen was collected from. Distribution It has a limited distribution in the Flinders Range of South Australia and is considered to be a rare species which was previously thought to be extinct. It is commonly situated among outcropping areas of quartzite along the lines of watercourses and on the slopes of rocky gulleys growing in skeletal soils in open woodland or shrubland communities often in association with Eucalyptus camaldulensis , Eucalyptus flindersii and Callitris glaucophylla.

A peaceful transition or transfer of power is a concept important to democratic governments, where the leadership of a government peacefully hands over control of government to a newly elected or selected leadership. This may be at times of election or during the transition from a different kind of political regime, i.e. the post-Communist period after the fall of the Soviet Union, or the elections in Libya following the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. In scholarship examining democratization and emerging democracies, study of the successful transitions of power is used to understand the transition to constitutional democracy and the relative stability of that government. A 2014 study concluded that 68 countries had never had a peaceful transition of power due to an election since 1788. The first peaceful transition of power in a country is often treated as an important stage in a government transition towards democracy such as when researching elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Successful transitions during tense political moments such as the Velvet Revolution in Armenia in 2018 are interpreted as signs of improved governance within the country, an important milestone in democratization and functioning civil society. Alternately, challenges in transitioning power peacefully such as occurred in elections in Georgia, may harm the international reputation of that country. Peaceful transitions require a number of strong democratic institutions to pursue such as willingness from opposition parties to serve as a loyal opposition. Transitions by election place power holders in vulnerable positions as not only do they risk potential changes in policy and practice and thus their means of power, but also for political retribution or retaliation. Especially in new democracies, there may be a need to create new institutions to facilitate a peaceful transition. After the Libyan Revolution, the National Transitional Council provided a 10-month period that facilitated the \\"first peaceful transition of power in Libya's modern history\\".President- elect Ronald Reagan is sworn in as president of the United States in a symbolic peaceful transfer of power in 1981.In a stable institutionalized democracy, a peaceful transition is the expected outcome of an election and a 2014 analysis found that once a country begins peaceful transfers of power, it is very likely to keep doing so. A peaceful transition of power is important to the United States presidential transition and institutionalized through symbolic acts like the United States presidential inauguration. However, even this can not be entirely relied upon as there is a risk of \\"democratic backsliding\\". In 2020, this concept was questioned by President Donald Trump during his 2020 presidential campaign while other elected officials actively supported the institution and process due to its significance in American democracy.

The orchestral version also features a rolling triplet accompaniment in the cellos where in the trio the cello simply doubles the piano's bass line.Brown, A.

Finale. Tempo di menuetto. As with the Trio No. 38 in D major (Hob. XV:24), the finale is in the style of a minuet, but tempered with melancholy and wistfulness. It is thought to have been the last movement Haydn wrote before leaving England for good in August 1795. The work was published in October 1795 by the English firm of Longman and Broderip as part of a set of three with the opus number (seldom used today) 73. The other two are No. 38 in D major (Hob.

Born in present-day Alexandria, Virginia, he moved to Philadelphia in 1847, and spent the rest of his life there. Swann held around 40 slaves, whom he freed shortly after his marriage in 1847. Swann had leadership roles in several philanthropic organizations in Philadelphia, including the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Philadelphia Fountain Society, which financed the construction of numerous drinking fountains in the city. He also maintained a substantial art collection.  Life and education  Swann was born in Alexandria, Virginia (then part of the District of Columbia) in 1806. His father was Thomas Swann, appointed United States Attorney for the District by James Monroe. Swann's brother, Thomas Swann, became governor of Maryland. Swann attended the University of Virginia. He then studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving an MD in 1830. He inherited an island in the Potomac River from his father. Together with these real estate holdings, he also took control of his father's slaves. He later constructed a mansion on the Virginia side of the river. He was married to Maria Bell in October 1847. For some time after his marriage he divided his time between Philadelphia and Virginia. His estate was suffering from his frequent absence, however, and his wife's health was too precarious for travel. Consequently, he sold the estate and emancipated the 40 slaves under his control. Swann died on March 21, 1876.  Reform efforts  Swann was elected the first president of the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). In addition to his leadership of the SPCA, Swann wrote stories for children designed to foster their appreciation for animals. Swann also served as the first president of the Philadelphia Fountain Society, founded in February 1869, which sponsored the construction of drinking fountains for humans and working animals in the city. His aim was in part to \\"promote temperance and relieve animal suffering\\".  Union League  Union League of Philadelphia, 2017. Constructed 1865. When the Civil War began, Swann joined the Union League, and helped to fund the construction of its clubhouse on Broad Street. When the war ended, Swann stated that he was in favor of treating Southerners kindly.  Art collecting  Swann's art collection reportedly included works by Rubens, Titian, Leonardo da Vinci, Murillo, Angelica Kauffman, and Leutze.  Legacy  The Swann Memorial Fountain In 1924, the Philadelphia Fountain Society built the Swann Memorial Fountain in honor of Dr. Swann. The fountain was designed by sculptor Alexander Stirling Calder and architect Wilson Eyre. The fountain is located in Logan Circle, at the midpoint of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

Both countries self-identified with the wider Mediterranean region and shared membership in the Non-Aligned Movement. During the Algerian War Yugoslavia provided significant logistical and diplomatic support to the Algerian side which affected its intra-European relations with France. Within the Non-Aligned Movement Yugoslavia closely collaborated with self-described core members of India and Egypt while Algeria followed self-described progressive group in which Cuba played prominent role. Yugoslavia officially recognized the independence of Algeria on 5 September 1961 as the first country in Europe to do so. This led to rupture in Yugoslav-French relations as Paris decided to withdraw its ambassador from Belgrade. History President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito in Algeria (1969) During the Algerian War representatives of the National Liberation Front described their Mediterranean ally Yugoslavia as their closest non-Arab allies. During the war Yugoslavia de facto recognition of the FLN as the representative of the Algerian nation, but considering France's stern warnings avoided de jure recognition of the movement. It is believed that the first secret contacts were established in 1954 in Cairo when Yugoslavia officially sold military equipment to Egypt which after one month were transferred to Algeria. In October 1956 Belgrade hosted the meeting between FLN's Mohamed Khider and SFIO's Pierre Herbaut, while from 1957 Yugoslavia abandoned intermediation efforts and decided to openly support Algeria. From that time French Navy started to interspect Yugoslav trade ships in Mediterranean believig that they deliver aid to Algerian rebels. On 7 August 1957 French Navy discovered and took 70 tones of military equipment of Yugoslav ship Srbija [Engish: Serbia] while the largest discovered delivery was discovered on 18 January 1958 close to Oran when Jadrolinija's ship Slovenija [English: Slovenia] was found in possession of 148 tons of military equipment. President of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic Ferhat Abbas visited Belgrade between 6 and 12 January 1959 where he talked with the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito. On 2 February 1959 other two members Krim Belkacem and Mhamed Yazid held talks with the Ambasador of Yugoslavia to Tunisia. Yugoslavia provided food, medicine, and military supplies to the Algerian fighters which Algerians did not expect from a middle-sized European communist country. Yugoslav population perceived Algerian experiences as reminiscent of its not so distant National Liberation and Revolution during the World War II. Country therefore paid attention to the cultural aspect of the Algerian War and sent its photographers such as Stevan Labudoviƒá who recorded 27 films and 274 photos in 1959-1962 period, official El Moudjahid newspapers were issued in Belgrade edition as well the first gramophone recording of the Kassaman. On 1 Mart 1960 National Liberation Front (FLN) opened its Bureau in Belgrade. Against the Indian wishes but with support of Sukarno and Nkrumah, the Algerian FLN was invited to attend the 1961 Non-Aligned Conference in Belgrade under the status of a sovereign government.

The band stands out from other Russian punk-rock bands for it's highly politicized lyrics and propaganda of healthy lifestyle. All members of the band are vegetarians, do not use alcohol, drugs and do not smoke. The band was popular in Dubna in the early years of its existence, but after the release of its fourth album \\"In the Range Between Despair and Hope\\" and the cancellation of a number of concerts by local authorities. It gained national fame and became one of the leading performers of rock music in Russia. Currently, Pornofilmy has 13 releases, including 8 studio albums and 5 mini-albums. The last studio album, \\"It Shall Pass\\" was released in January 2020.  Name  According to band leader Vladimir Kotlyarov, the name of the band is a metaphor for the surrounding reality. > The name of the band was invented in our garage - I wanted the word to > catch, excite, and outrage. I heard it on some crime chronicle on the TV: > they said that an underground workshop for the production of porn movies was > liquidated. It seemed to me that this word was stupid, but cool for the name > of the band. Over time, for many people this word became a proper name and > lost its original meaning. Although there are still restrictions - for > example, we will not be invited to the TV. But we are not torn: we still > remain underground (–≠—Ç–æ—Ç –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª –≤—ã—à–µ–ª –≤ ‚Ññ 119 –æ—Ç 25 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2017)  History  = Origins = The band was founded in 2008, but the musicians began to actively develop the band only in 2012, after all the participants abandoned alcohol, smoking and other bad habits, which became the main theme of most of the band's lyrics at that time. The members of the band recorded all their music in their garage and initially mixed music themselves, but then a friend of the band got engaged in mastering for payment. The band started gradually getting more and more attention in Russia, but it wasn't always positive. The first song \\"Come!\\" from the album ‚ÄúRussian Dream. Part I‚Äùof 2015 is dedicated to a fan of the band who committed suicide by throwing himself from the roof of his house due to a lack of understanding and support in his environment. His mother later wrote a letter to the band asking them to write a song telling their young fans to never abandon hope for life, so that no one repeats her son's fate. = Growth of popularity = The band's popularity grew immensely after the realize of two albums - \\"In the Range Between Despair and Hope\\" in 2018 and \\"It shall pass\\" in 2020. They gave a performance in 2020 in Moscow's \\"adrenalin\\" stadium and St. Petersburg's Ice palace stadium, as well as on Russia's national TV on the Evening Urgant talk show.  Charity  The band often performs at charity concerts. In mid-2017, the bandlaunched a crowdfunding project on the Planeta.ru website, where they announced the recording of a new album, adding that all the money raised would go not to the recording, but to the charitable foundation \\"Fund Against Leukemia\\". Out of the requested 550,000 rubles. the band raised 909,101 rubles. For the same foundation the band held an online acoustic concert where they collected additional money. In addition, they personally came to the foundation and distributed clothes, food and other goods for those in need. On May 2018, the band visited children's oncological center, where they held a music master class, and also taught the children about the basics of building melodies. On April 1, 2020, the vocalist of the band Vladimir Kotlyarov played a third charity acoustic online concert in support of the Fund for the Fight Against Leukemia, which again raised over 950,000 rubles. Additionally, on the YouTube channel, regular users donated additional 855,000 rubles. The whole sum was given to the fund the next morning.–ü–∞–Ω–∫-–≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞ ¬´–ü–æ—Ä–Ω–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å–º—ã¬ª —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–ª–∞ –º–∏–ª–ª–∏–æ–Ω —Ä—É–±–ª–µ–π –Ω–∞ –±–æ—Ä—å–±—É —Å –ª–µ–π–∫–µ–º–∏–µ–π  Scandals  The band has always been in scandals, mostly for their anti-government lyrics as well as their name. In Ulan-Ude, posters with the name of the band were hung around the city. Local residents decided that it was an advertisement for pornography, and began to write complaints.

In October 2017, at the request of the federal security service and the city authorities, two concerts of the band were canceled in the Vladimir region, in the city of Murom, and in the Nizhny Novgorod region, in the city of Vyksa. Initially, the concert of the band was planned to take place on October 21 in the city of Murom in the \\"Art Bar 111\\" club. But the owner of the club, Tatyana Makurina, phoned Anna Shishkina, chairman of the Muroma Committee for the Development of the Consumer Market, and demanded that the band's concert be canceled because of the propaganda of extremism and fascism. Later, Makurina was summoned to the prosecutor's office, where the prosecutor and the FSB explained that \\"the Pornofilmy band will not perform in the Vladimir region because they are extremists\\". The city administration also threatened the band: > ‚ÄúWe didn't want to cancel the concert, but we received a call from the Murom > administration. We were told: ‚ÄúYou see, Murom is a small city. Anything can > happen with you, your business and your family. ‚Äù They threatened that they > would close my business, I will not be able to work and live in Murom‚Äù. After the concert was moved to the neighboring town of Vyksa, the band was still unable to give a performance. According to the band's guitarist Alexander Rusakov, the club owners refused to hold the concert due to \\"phone threats about the possible closure of the establishment\\" and it was not the first time when the authorities in the Vladimir region wiished to ban the concert of the band. As a result, the band's vocalist conducted an online broadcast of the band's acoustic concert on VKontakte. On July 23, 2018, half a month before the start of the Nashestvie festival, the band announced on its pages in social networks that it would not perform at the festival due to the propaganda of militarism. \\"No propaganda of militarism - this was our main condition for participation in the festival\\". Following Pornofilmy, in the next few days bands like \\"Elysium\\", \\"Yorsh\\", \\"Distemper\\", \\"Poshlaya Molli\\" and the singer Monetochka refused to participate in the festival for the same reason. For several years now, the Nashestvie festival has been held with the support of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, but in 2018 the organizers announced that the Ministry of Defense would not participate and a number of bands agreed to perform at the festival. Two weeks prior the organizers informed the bands that the RF Ministry of Defense would appear at Invasion this year as well, and for this reason many artists refused to perform. In January 2020, the FAS department in the Ulyanovsk region opened a case due to the advertising of the band's concert. According to a local resident who wrote a complaint, \\"the ad's name for an adult film band, without specifying the punk rock band itself, is misleading consumers\\". On March 11 2020, in the city of Chelyabinsk, the Galaktika Club refused to hold a concert of the band, citing a letter from the police in which it was said that the band's songs ‚Äúcontain obscene language, information encouraging children to take actions that pose a threat to life and health, calls drug use, denial of family values, disrespect for parents\\".

The song, with a central theme of feeling disconnected, was written by Alan Menken and David Zippel, and replaced by \\"Go the Distance\\". It was the first song that was written for the character of Hercules. For his Hercules audition, Roger Bart sang the deleted song Proud of your Boy from Aladdin and Shooting Star - Menken cried during his audition. The production team recorded the full track with Hercules' singing voice Roger Bart and the full orchestra before replacing it. Menken's original concept for the sonic palette of the movie was Candide, though when it was decided to switch to gospel it was decided that the song felt \\"too wistful, with not enough drive\\". They thought it made Hercules seem too soft and decided they wanted to emphasise the \\"muscularity of his journey\\". As a result, the duo of songwriters wrote Go the Distance. Bart said that when the song was cut and they decided to write him a new song, he was \\"thrilled and flabbergasted and grateful\\". Bart connected to the piece because of his own disorientation as a young actor, saying of the song: \\"That the song was so much about feeling out of place but also connected to a part of yourself that's very strong inside. That even though you feel like you didn't belong where you were at that moment, you knew it wasn't just you. There was something about yourself that was going to be okay in all of this, even though you knew this was where you were not supposed to be right now.\\" Menken said \\"It's a very sweet song and it's very much a heartfelt 'I wish I knew where I belong' [song]\\". A single version was recorded by Boyzone as \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\"/\\"Shooting Star\\", which reached a peak of number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. Similar to \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" from Aladdin, \\"Written in Stone\\" from Mulan, and \\"Human Again\\" from Beauty and the Beast, this deleted song was reinstated in the stage adaption of the film: the 2019 musical Hercules.

His father Akbar Ali had also served in the police force and had earned a reputation for solving crimes and had retired with high honours. Abdul Ali continued in the tradition and was once known as the Sherlock Holmes of India.  Career of his father  Abdul Ali's father Akbar Ali was born in 1802 in a family of Sayyids who had fled from the Abbasid Caliphs of Baghdad to settle in India. The family had been provided with a title to settle in the village of Manchar, Khed, where Mir Abdul Ali had been born. He was taught Marathi and Hindustani but his parents died young. By marriage he was linked to another Syed family from Narayangaon. He went to Bombay to seek employment and joined the Bombay Police Force on 1 September 1821 under Captain Shortt, Head of the Police. In 1840 he was sent to Aden to organize a police force there. In 1852 he became a Jamadar and in 1856, a Subedar. During the 1857 rebellion he helped the British police identify a critical informant who had intelligence on the plans of sepoys. In 1861, he received the title of Khan Bahadur. He demonstrated skills in solving several cases and in 1865, Akbar Ali was made an inspector. Among the cases he solved were currency forgeries and in one case he brought to book two forgers in Surat that included a European and an influential Indian. In another case he arrested a Chinese burglar named John Wynn. Yet another case was a mass poisoning in Kalbadevi where two women had died and three others had suffered from the poisoning. Akbar Ali retired with honours in December 1883. He died on 8 March 1894, at the age of 92. Abdul Ali worked with his father and helped the latter solve several cases even before joining the police force.  Work in the Bombay Police  Abdul Ali passed the Matriculation Examination of Bombay University in 1865 and joined the Police force on 15 December of the same year. Abdul Ali solved his first case of a swindler named Karsandas Purushotamdas Bhansali in 1866 and in the same year also solved a case of currency forging. Another prominent case was the intentional burning of a ship, the S.S. Aurora, by its captain. He also helped locate Moulvi Liaqat Ali, an associate of Nana Saheb who was involved in murdering Europeans during 1857. Khan was hailed as an Indian \\"Sherlock Holmes\\". At Sir Frank Souter's recommendation, he too was conferred the title of Khan Bahadur in 1873. In the same year he helped uncover a murder plotted by a Bombay High Court solicitor and his clerk. Yet another investigation led to the charging of the Malharrao Gaekwar of Baroda of attempting to poison Colonel Phayre, the British Resident. In 1876 he uncovered a fraud involving contractors and forest department officers to illegally cut and trade in timber using false records. Sir Frank Souter noted in 1881 that on account of his being a native he was debarred from being a Superintendent. He was made a Justice of the Peace for the City of Bombay. Souter sought, on behalf of Ali, from the Government a suitable salary comparable to a 1st Class Police Inspector (ie Rs 250 with Rs 25 travelling allowance and additional cover for cost of living in Bombay). In 1881 Sir Frank Souter, Police Commissioner, recommended Ali to the title of First Class Sardar of the Deccan. This was seconded by Colonel Wilson and he received the title on 30th May 1891, signed by Viceroy Lansdowne. He received a Kaiser-i-Hind Gold medal in 1901. He retired in 1903. A son of Abdul Ali Mir Sarfraz Ali who had trained as a lawyer in England died in Karachi in October 1896.

Rule 63 is an Internet meme that states that, as a rule, \\"for every given female character, there is a male version of that character\\" and vice versa. It is one of the \\"Rules of the Internet\\" that began in 2006 as a Netiquette guide on 4chan and were eventually expanded upon by including deliberately mocking rules, of which Rule 63 is an example. It began to see general use in fandom communities as a term to refer to both fan-made and official gender-swaps of existing fictional characters.  Origin  Prior to the creation of Rule 63, gender-swapping was popularized in video games in the 1990s by the finishing move of Darkstalkers character Demitri Maximoff, a vampire. Called the \\"Midnight Bliss\\", it involved tossing a rose at a character to transform them into a helpless maiden and completely drain them of life energy. This meant that female versions of all the game's male characters had to be created, as well as those of Street Fighter and SNK characters when SNK vs. Capcom included Maximoff. These female interpretations became popular and resulted in large amounts of fan art, as well as prompting art of gender-swaps of other male and female characters. Rule 63 was created in mid-2007 as an addition to the humorous \\"Rules of the Internet\\", originally created around the end of 2006 on 4chan. It lists two statements: \\"for every given male character, there is a female version of that character\\", and \\"for every given female character, there is a male version of that character\\". The primacy of the male to female transition contains an implied subtext that female to male gender-swapping is less important. The trope, originally seen primarily unofficially, later became more widely disseminated in popular culture, with critics stating that it had been \\"recognized by Hollywood\\".  Usage  Rule 63 is commonly used as a term to refer to gender-swapped interpretations of existing characters in fanworks, such as fan art, fan fiction and cosplay, and it is particularly pervasive in the anime and manga community, where communities sprang up built around romantic gender-swap relationships. It also often overlaps with the creation of moe anthropomorphic female versions of non-human, male characters. A well-known example of this is Bowsette, a female version of the Mario antagonist Bowser that became one of the most popular Internet memes of 2018. However, it has also been used by critics to refer to official characters who are gender-swapped versions of older characters or fictional beings, such as Number Six from Battlestar Galactica being a \\"sexy female\\" version of a Cylon Centurion, and the female main cast of the 2016 reboot of Ghostbusters. The creation of Rule 63 cosplays such as gender-swapped superheroes has been cited as popular amongst female cosplayers as giving them the ability to portray roles beyond socially approved gendered scripts. It is seen as empowering, allowing cosplayers to wear clothing and weapons usually not afforded to female characters. However, certain characters with inherent gender fluidity are said to work better than others. Such gender-bending cosplay, which allows the cosplayer to choose what behavior enhances the performance, can be contrasted with crossplay, which completely immerses the cosplayer in the codes of another gender.  Notable examples  = In film = * The 2016 Ghostbusters reboot featured a cast of female leads that was called \\"proof of Rule 63\\", with similarities noted between each team member and one of the original male team members. It was called an official acknowledgement of what was formerly an unofficial, fan- driven phenomenon. = In video games = * In the Mario series, the fan-made Bowsette is a female version of the male antagonist Bowser, created through the use of the Super Crown, a power-up that imparts the appearance and abilities of Princess Peach on its user. Nintendo's official clarification is that the item is only usable by Toadette, and the creation of Bowsette is \\"technically impossible\\". * In the Zelda series, the character Linkle was created by Nintendo as an alternate-universe gender-swap of the typical main character, Link. However, she does not possess his powers, and is instead a normal girl who dual-wields a pair of crossbows. Made playable in Hyrule Warriors Legends, she was also modded into The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild by a fan to replace Link. The character Sheik, who Princess Zelda has the ability to transform into in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, has been called the most iconic example of female-to-male gender-swapping in gaming, although Sheik has both male and female characteristics.

The artwork in part is Basquiat's depiction of a catfight between two of his lovers, Suzanne Mallouk and the singer Madonna.  Background  In 1981, Jean-Michel Basquiat began dating Suzanne Mallouk, a waitress he met at Nightbirds bar in the East Village. He moved in with her and she paid the rent while he focused on painting. That same year, he made the transition from a street artist to exhibiting his artwork in galleries. Basquiat moved into a loft provided by gallerist Annina Nosei in SoHo. He dated Mallouk on-and-off until 1983. In 1982, Basquiat began dating Madonna, then an up-and-coming singer who had released her debut single \\"Everybody\\" and was working on her debut album Madonna. They dated until 1983. One night in 1982, Mallouk spotted Basquiat with Madonna at The Roxy nightclub in Chelsea, and she attacked Madonna in a jealous rage.  Analysis  A Panel of Experts is painted on stretched canvas. The canvas is on the base of a handmade structure, tying pieces of wood with twine. He drew some images and painted the background black, which overlaps some of the images. This creates a strong contrast and draws attention to the text and imagery. The top left side has \\"VENUS\\" written with \\"MADONNA¬©\\" crossed out underneath. Basquiat referred to Suzanne Mallouk as Venus in his paintings. He crossed out words to bring more attention to them. \\"I cross out words so you will see them more; the fact that they are obscured makes you want to read them,\\" he said. The copyright symbol next to Madonna's name suggests that he was aware of her impending fame. Basquiat told his art dealer Larry Gagosian that \\"she's going to be huge.\\" There is humor depicting the catfight between Mallouk and Madonna as stick figures. According to Mallouk, Basquiat told that her that she won the fight which is why he crossed out Madonna's name, adding she \\"beat her up just like a Puerto Rican girl.\\" Growing up Basquiat wanted to be a cartoonist. In this painting he incorporates and repurposes cartoon images. Below the fight, there is a superman-like figure accompanied by the word \\"KRAK,\\" relating to the comic book-style of adding onomatopoeic sound effects. The phrase \\"SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON\\" is written on the top right of the paining. On the bottom of the painting, text relating to Saturday morning cartoons are written such as \\"SUGAR COATED CORN PUFFS,\\" \\"MILK\\" and \\"SUGAR.\\" Basquiat's crown motif which appears frequently in his early work is also present twice.  Exhibitions  A Panel of Experts was created for Basquiat's solo exhibition at the Fun Gallery in New York in November 1982. It is now part of the permanent collection at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. It was on display at the Vancouver Art Gallery as part of MashUp: The Birth of Modern Culture in 2016. From September 2017 to January 2018, it was exhibited at the Barbican Centre in London as part of Basquiat: Boom for Real. Madonna, who was Basquiat's date for the Fun Gallery exhibit opening in 1982, visited the Barbican exhibit and took a photo in front the painting in 2017.

It is installed on the lawn in next to the museum, at 525 South State Street.  History  Ginnever created it in 1975, and UMMA purchased and installed it in 1977. Originally, it was in front of UMMA, but when the museum underwent a major renovation in 2008‚Äì2009, it was moved to the south lawn of the building, across the street from the University of Michigan Law School. UMMA's director in the 1970s, Bret Waller, said of the decision to purchase the piece, \\"We spent over a year surveying the field and looking at sculpture before selecting this piece by Charles Ginnever . . . I felt it was the best piece available for our purposes and recommended it to our executive committee. Daedalus is historically the most significant piece in what appears to be the most important series Ginnever has ever done.\\"  Description  The abstract sculpture is made of Cor-Ten steel. UMMA describes Daedalus's shape as \\"five parallelograms bent along diagonal lines that lean into each other.\\" The sculpture is about 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The concave space underneath it is about 11 feet deep.  Meaning  The sculpture is named for mythical figure Daedalus, the father of Icarus.

But the steel in this Daedalus thing - worked by Charles > Ginneyer, a New York artist who specializes in such stuff - really deserves > to be on the lawn of the art museum instead of in an automobile bumper. > Well, what's the attraction?

The atmosphere, of course, is part of the > sculpture, too.

In September 1977, Lionel Biron placed a large price tag reading \\"$500,000\\" on the side of the sculpture. The Michigan Daily reported, > \\"The price tag is a poetic metaphor,\\" said Biron, \\"and should not be taken > at face value alone.\\" In a news release handed out on the spot Biron > informed the public that the $500,000 price tag - a figure arrived at > partially by adding labor and material costs - was not a criticism of the > unusual sculpture. \\"What shocks most people in my assertion is not the > relative aesthetic worth of the two works of art,\\" Biron said, referring to > Daedalus and the price tag, \\"but the genuine challenge it presents to > economic assumptions upon which our society rests.

Further, de Momper came to represent a group of painters who tended towards a more imaginary representation of landscape. This group of painters favored foreign views and alpine topography. In this painting, the image is seen from a slant view, and framed by high mountain massifs. The latter descend on both sides to the valley wherein a river is flowing.

Barahoti was the first location in Indian territory to be claimed by China, and notably, the Chinese did not know the exact location of Barahoti when claiming it.  History  In July 1952, an Intelligence Bureau of India note stated that during the end of the 19th century the Tibetans had been establishing a customs post at the Hoti Plain. In 1890, the British got the Tibetans to remove the post, however, the Tibetans re- established the post in later years. The IB note said that if the Tibetans are not removed, they may eventually claim the territory. However, following a statement by the Uttar Pradesh government at the time that no encroachment had taken place in the area, the Chinese claimed the area as there own. Further, Indian negotiators made a mistake at the time; in Beijing, they only named six passes without delineating other locations on the border border. China saw the opportunity and started claiming numerous areas including the area south of the Tunjun-la pass, where the plain of Barahoti is located. India and China communicated until 1958, when a conference on the issue was held. The talks failed. After the failure of the talks, Subimal Dutt wrote: \\"The only positive suggestion made by the Chinese is that there should be a joint local enquiry\\". Claude Arpi notes that \\"India refused (the joint local enquiry) when it discovered that was just a pretext for China to find out the exact location of the place. They thought that Barahoti (they call it Wuje) was north of Tunjun- la.\\" In India's central sector consisting of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, Barahoti is part of the Barahoti Lapthal Sangchamalla claim by China.  Geography  Barahoti is located south of the Tunjun-la pass. It is a three kilometer trek from Barahoti to Barahoti ridge, from where Parvati Kund is a short distance. Within Barahoti is the seasonal Hoti river. Barahoti is surrounded by snowy mountain peaks.  Recent developments  In Barahoti, there are small Hindu shrines. The Chinese have reportedly pulled down these shrines multiple times. The border is not demarcated in the area and it is a demilitarised zone in which Indo-Tibetan Border Police do not carry firearms. As per an agreement in 2005, firearms in the area are not allowed. However, in 2016, uniformed Chinese soldiers entered the area with firearms. Claude Arpi notes that the government of India played down the situation. Chinese transgressions into Barahoti have been reported by the Indian media over the years including in 2014, 2017 and 2018. In 2013, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand told New Delhi that 37 incursion attempts had been made between 2007-2012 in Barahoti.

Formeal diplomatic relations at the level of Embassy were established in 1959. Both countries were the founding member states of the Non-Aligned Movement at the 1961 Non-Aligned Conference in Belgrade. President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito paid his first State visit to Ghana in 1961, just one year after the full independence of the Dominion of Ghana. History Informal contacts were initiated as early as 1956 when an unsuccessful proposal came from the Ghanaian Erick Nkrumah towards the Yugoslav Delegation at the United Nations to visit Yugoslavia The proposal was not fesable for the delegation so it was rejected. On 24 November 1958 meeting of Trusteeship Council Ghana and Yugoslavia, together with India and Iraq, requested United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld to convene a Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly to consider the question of the future of the Trust Territories of British Cameroon and French Cameroon. During the 1961 President Tito diplomatic tour President of Ghana Kwame Nkrumah gave the Yugoslav president men's slippers which symbolize willingness to a long journey, with a message related to good long-term results of Tito's visit. Yugoslav delegation gifted Nkrumah with a Yugoslav produced car Crvena zastava 1100, and his wife Fathia Nkrumah with a set of violet crystal plates. Other gifts included an X-ray machine Morava to the city of Accra, a cinema projector to the University of Ghana and a radio and two sets of toys to the city hospital. Yugoslavia approved loans to Ghana, sent experts, and helped Ghana build a naval base. Economic relations in early years were modest but growing with Ghanaian import from Yugoslavia amounting to 15,383 GBP in 1958, 72,380 GBP in 1959 and 241,462 GBP in 1960.

It is divided into High Petergate and Low Petergate. History Petergate generally follows the course of the via principalis of Roman Eboracum, which ran from the Porta Principalis Dextra, now Bootham Bar, to the Porta Principalis Sinistra, in what is now King's Square. The main deviation from the Roman route is around its junction with Grape Lane, and this has been associated with destruction occurring when the Great Heathen Army entered York in 866. Based on archaeological records, the York Civic Trust argues that the street fell out of use immediately after the Roman period, but was re-established while the Roman walls still survived. This may have been as early as 627, when the first York Minster was built. In its early years, the minster had a large cemetery, which extended as far as Petergate, around its junction with Stonegate. The current property boundaries largely date from the 10th-century, and the street has always been a desirable area, with its junction with Stonegate a particularly high-status location. In the Mediaeval period, the street lay immediately outside the precinct of the minster. As the minster is dedicated to Saint Peter, this led to the name \\"Petergate\\", which was first recorded in about 1190. In 1283, a wall was constructed around the precinct, with gateways opposite Duncombe Place and Stonegate. Buildings on the north-east side of the street were built up against the wall. Almost the whole street lay within the parish of St Michael-le-Belfrey, the church, on the street and next to the Minster, having been first recorded in 1294. The street remained important in over the following centuries, and in the 17th-century, the Talbot Inn was established, one of the main inns in the city. In the 18th- and 19th- centuries, parts of the street were rebuilt, and buildings around the front of York Minster were demolished, to open up access to it. Despite this, numerous Mediaeval buildings survive, all in commercial use. The well-known view of the Minster from Low Petergate is described by the City of York Council as \\"excellent\\". Layout and architecture Looking north along High Petergate, towards Bootham Bar View south on High Petergate, towards Low Petergate High Petergate starts at Bootham Bar on the York city walls, where Bootham terminates, and it runs south-east. The Hole-in-the-Wall snickelway, the shortest official snickelway in the city, leads off its north-east side. At the front of York Minster, it opens up to form a major junction with Duncombe Place, Precentor's Court and Minster Yard, with access also to Dean's Park. The next junction is with Stonegate and Minster Gates, past which the street continues as Low Petergate. Grape Lane leads off the south-west side, as does the snickelway Lund's Court, while another snickelway, Hornpot Lane, leads off the north-east side. The street ends at King's Square, where it meets Church Street and Goodramgate. Until the creation of King's Square, in the 18th- century, it was considered to continue slightly further, to a junction with St Andrewgate, Colliergate and King's Court. On High Petergate, notable buildings on the north-east side include 4 High Petergate, built in 1782 and possibly designed by Peter Atkinson; 8 High Petergate, with a 14th-century roof truss; the Hole in the Wall pub, mostly 18th-century but with some earlier timber framing; 12-18 High Petergate, an early-20th century range built in imitation of an earlier building which stood on the site; 24-36 High Petergate, facing the Minster, built in 1838 but incorporate parts of a Georgian building; and St Michael-le-Belfrey church.

Beyond Duncombe Place are 25-29 High Petergate, built in the 1700s; 31 High Petergate, with 15th-century origins; and the timber-framed 33-35 High Petergate. The street numbering continues in Low Petergate, and on the north-east side lie 48-50 Low Petergate, with some Mediaeval stonework in the basement; the 18th-century Adams House; 56-60 Low Petergate, built by John Stockdale in about 1500; the former York College for Girls; 64 and 66 Low Petergate, incorporating part of the former Talbot Inn, and with 15th-century origins; the 15th-century 76 Low Petergate; and 17th- century 78 Low Petergate. On the south-west side are 41 and 43 Low Petergate, built in the 16th-century; 49 and 51 Low Petergate, with Mediaeval origins; 55 and 57 Low Petergate, both 17th-century; the 14th-century 67 Low Petergate; and then a timber-framed row, seven of which have their gable ends facing the street: 17th-century 71 Low Petergate, 16th-century 73-77 Low Petergate, 14th- century 79 Low Petergate, 15th-century 81 Low Petergate, and 83 Low Petergate, built about 1600. 87 Low Petergate has 14th-century origins; 89 Low Petergate is 17th-century; and 91-93 Low Petergate has some 17th-century material.

It is located along the Karis‚ÄìHanko railway, and its neighboring stations are Skogby in the west and Dragsvik in the east. The Finnish Heritage Agency has declared the Eken√§s station area a protected culture site of national importance.  History  In the planning stages of the private Hyvink√§√§‚ÄìHanko railroad in the 1860s, it was not originally intended for a station to be built in Eken√§s: instead, the line was intended to cut through the eastern side of the Pohjanpit√§j√§nlahti bay, reaching Hanko via the ironworks of Svart√•, Antskog and Fiskars as well as the port of Skuru. Eventually, it was decided to have the line follow the western coast of the bay instead, which helped Eken√§s reverse its trend of negative population growth starting in 1870. The Eken√§s station is one of the three preserved station houses of the original Hyvink√§√§-Hanko railway. The building, designed by Knut Nylander, was thoroughly repaired in 1877 and an extension was completed in 1914. After the conclusion of the Winter War and the subsequent leasing of the Hanko peninsula to the Soviet Union, Skogby became the terminus of the passenger trains on the line; however, on the onset of the Continuation War and the escape of Soviet troops from Hanko, regular passenger services to Eken√§s continued to be suspended over security concerns. Dragsvik became the terminus instead, and travellers bound for Eken√§s were subjected to a security check in Dragsvik, after which they had to continue their journey by foot. The Eken√§s harbour line was dismantled in 1996, and the entire trackyard followed suit in 1999, being replaced by the new passing loop built in Dragsvik in 1998. The station building was transferred to the ownership of Senate Properties and sold on in 2007. It was renovated and converted to a travel centre in 2013.

It is a mycoheterotrophic herb that spends its entire life cycle, including flowering, at or below the soil surface. As at September 2020, R. speciosa has not yet been accepted as a valid name by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families or the Australian Plant Census. Description Rhizanthella speciosa is a leafless, sympodial herb with a horizontal rhizome and underground stem probably similar to that of R. slateri. From October to early November, the plant produces a flower head wide containing fifteen to thirty-five flowers about in diameter. The flower heads are bright mauve to pinkish purple and are surrounded by sixteen to eighteen overlapping, fleshy, egg-shaped to triangular bracts long and wide. After pollination, the flower produces a fleshy, narrow cylindrical drupe that is pinkish to light maroon when ripe. Taxonomy and naming This species of underground orchid was discovered in 2016 by scientific illustrator Maree Elliot and formally described in 2020 by Mark Clements and David Jones in the journal Lankesteriana from material collected in Barrington Tops National Park. The specific epithet speciosa is from the Latin meaning \\"showy\\" or \\"splendid\\". Distribution and habitat Rhizanthella speciosa was found under dense leaf litter in tall wet sclerophyll forest of the Barrington Tops National Park with Sydney blue gum, tallowood, and turpentine, and a well- developed rainforest subcanopy with Trochocarpa laurina and Synoum glandulosum. Conservation status As of 2020, only fifty plants in a single locality are known. The habitat where it grows is widespread, but searches have not uncovered other populations. Thus the species meets the \\"critically endangered\\" definition. The population's exact location is kept unpublished for its protection.

Paul the Apostle wrote that a woman should have exousia \\"on [or perhaps 'over'] her head\\", but the meaning of the passage is not clear. Etymology According to William Edwin Vine's Vine's Expository Dictionary, exousia means \\"authority\\". The word derives from the verb exesti for \\"it is lawful\\". It is used over 100 times in the New Testament in different contexts. Used in different contexts in the Book of Romans and First Corinthians it can mean the power or authority to occupy a position of superiority. In the Epistle to Philemon parrhesia is used in a similar context instead ofexousia. Biblical usage It is used for the authority of Jesus to forgive sins (), and Paul invokes it in 2 Corinthians for his own apostolic authority: \\"For though I should boast - somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction.\\" In other contexts it is used for Christ claiming that \\"all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth\\" (), or similarly \\"power over all flesh\\" (), and in The Book of Revelations in reference to the ten kings represented by the horns of the Beast that they \\"shall give their power and strength unto the beast\\".Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary The Book of John uses the term also in the context of Pilate's judicial power \\"I have the power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee\\", and also in Christ's response \\"Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin\\" (). It's used similarly in Luke: \\"And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what ye shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say\\". =Book of Revelation= The transfer of exousia from the two witnesses to the two beasts is a major theme in . At first the authority of the witnesses to perform signs and wonders, and call down judgments, is absolute.

Plantation Although in ruins years earlier, an 1864 image of the intact house was published in 1875 in Harper's Magazine. The club was built on a plantation that had initially belong to Lady Margaret Yeamans, the wife of Sir John Yeamans who was a Royal governor, in 1674. When her husband died, Lady Yeamans remarried to William Walley, and they had a plantation, possibly Yeamans Hall, in operation as a working plantation. Before 1704, the plantation passed to the second Landgrave Thomas Smith who, in 1738, devised this \\"brick house or family mansion at Goose Creek\\" and five hundred acres to his son. The elegant house was already gone by 1812 when the author of an 1855 book first visited the site. The plantation at Yeamans Hall was in ruins by 1812 but remains were still present into the 20th century. Country Club The plan for a winter colony development originated with W.E. Durant. The charter for the company was granted in December 1924. Upon opening, the club included only limited facilities including guest cottages for visiting members; in December 1926, the club announced that a clubhouse would be designed by James Gamble Rogers, the club's architect.The clubhouse was built in the 1920s in the Colonial style that was used throughout the community. The club was designed to attract wealthy Northern financial men to Charleston in the fall and winter with 200 to 300 house sites; the club was not intended to attract regular tourists and privacy and exclusivity were always hallmarks. The club's initial members were heavily drawn from New York's industrial and financial circles with five members from Charleston. The membership of the charter members cost $3000 while the next fifty paid $4000 and $5000 for the following fifty members. James Gamble Rogers followed a strictly Southern colonial style, and James O'Hear was the contractor. The Olmsted Brothers landscaping firm was used. Construction began on the temporary clubhouse in 1925 (planned to later serve as a wing of a larger clubhouse), but the plans would have originally called for the removal of the remnants of the historic house. Two members who were visiting the new club, objected to the destruction of the historic house and called for the location of the clubhouse to be shifted to accommodate the old house. By 1930, the facilities included the larger, final clubhouse; 25 houses; a service garage; housing for some of the staff; and guest cottages for members to use. In 1931, the number of houses increased to 33. By the time an additional staff housing building was added in 1937, a thirty-fourth house had been built. By 1961, there were thirty-eight houses. The club bought an adjacent 120 acre tract of timberland in 1937 at the cost of $12,000. Golf Course Construction of the first 18-hole golf course, designed by Seth Raynor, began on July 1, 1925, following a trip to Charleston by Raynor earlier. The golf course was about 6400 yards when it was completed, roughly evenly split before the front and back nine holes. The course was completed in June 1925. After time for plantings to take hold, the first golf was played by former New Jersey senator Joseph S. Frelinghuysen Jr., an early member of the club, who played a few holes with his guest Henry R. Sutphan, the president of the Electric Boat Company, on November 7, 1925. A sample of the houses planned for Yeamans Hall was included in the club prospectus in the 1920s.

Background  Brigadier General Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez became President of El Salvador following a military coup d'√©tat on 2 December 1931 against President Arturo Araujo Fajardo. During the lead up to World War II, Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez heavily sympathized with Germany and Italy.Haggerty 1990, p. 17 Despite his sympathies for the Axis, El Salvador joined the Allies on 8 December 1941 following the Bombing of Pearl Harbor.Astilla 1976, p. 184Armstrong 1982, p. 34  Coup  Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez held an election in January 1944 and was reelected to a third term as President. His action angered many businessmen, politicians, and military officer since he blatantly violated the Constitution.Haggerty 1990, p. 18 On 2 April 1944, military officers who had pro-Axis sympathies from the 1st Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Artillery Regiment initiated a coup against Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez. The coup started on Palm Sunday and most senior military and government officials were either at home or attending church. The rebels rose up in the departments of San Salvador and Santa Ana. They took control of the national radio station and the police headquarters of Santa Ana during the coup. The Salvadoran Air Force joined the conspirators and bombed the city of Santa Ana while the army attacked civilians and overthrew the local government. By the end of the day, Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez ordered military units still loyal to him to crush the revolt. The coup was suppressed on 3 April, martial law was declared, and a national curfew was put in place.  Aftermath  Following the coup attempt, Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez initiated reprisals that lasted for two weeks. Civilian protestors eventually forced Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez to resign on 9 May in the Strike of Fallen Arms.

Take-profit (T/P) orders are limit orders that are closed when a specified profit level is reached. The orders remain open only, if positions are hedged, trying to gain profit at another outbreak on one of the following trading days of the stock market. Commonly day-traded financial instruments with the SwissBox Trading are contracts for difference such as equity index futures. At present the main markets are the DAX Prime Standard of the 30 largest German companies and for the US stock market the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Forex trading  The SwissBox can be used by Forex traders. There are six major currencies that are traded with this method: (United States Dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Swiss Franc). Typical field of trading such is the British pound/US dollar currency pair rate, known as Cable (foreign exchange) or Euro/US Dollar currency pair. The euro remained the second most actively traded currency in foreign exchange markets. Evidence from the latest triennial survey of global foreign exchange activity conducted by the Bank for International Settlements suggests that the share of the euro in global foreign exchange turnover increased by around 1 percentage point between 2016 ‚Äì the year when the previous survey was conducted ‚Äì and 2019.  Based on Martingale  The strategy is based on knowledge from gambling, more precisely Martingale. A martingale describes a fair stochastic process in statistics. In the stock market, the process is better known as a random walk. Traders go long on a stock and hope for a profit. If the course turns, they short twice as many lots. Until the gains make up for the previous losses. In contrast to a Martingale strategy, in which you always buy more in the event of a loss and thus try to reduce the cost of the purchase price, with the SwissBox strategy a buy order is placed on the top at a previously defined price area and a sell order on the bottom of this area. The speculation is on the breakout from this area. By using CFD (Contract for Difference) products, it is possible to profit financially from both rising and falling exchange rates. The idea of the SwissBox strategy is to deal with breakouts and rapid market movements. Regulation on Contracts for Differences has been issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority based in Paris from 1 August 2018 regulating a restriction on the marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs to retail investors. This restriction consists of: leverage limits on opening positions; a margin close out rule on a per account basis; a negative balance protection on a per account basis; preventing the use of incentives by a CFD provider; and a firm specific risk warning delivered in a standardised way.  How to trade a breakout  Swissbox active in MetaTrader 4 With the SwissBox, a 15 point box and a profit target of 7.5 points in both directions is placed in MetaTrader. If the price breaks through the previously defined area of the range shortly before, during or after the market opening, a pending buy order takes effect. In the opposite case, the pending short order takes effect. If the trade now runs directly to the profit target, the trade is automatically closed. However, the strategy only unfolds its full potential in the case of false breakouts from the zone. The chart leaves the range but does not move towards the profit target. Instead, the course reverses and breaks out on the other side. The breakout in the opposite direction automatically leads to a new, larger trade in the opposite position. If the first position resolves a buy order, a sell position is entered with the second position.  Multiplication process  Calculation of the multiplier In the user interface called SwissBox, it is possible for every user to determine the position size himself. This is done using an algorithm and entering a risk value, e.g. 0.010% of the account balance. In addition to the position size, the risk and profit target also define the multiplier, which plays an important role in building up the traded positions. In a sideways phase, there can be multiple false breakouts before the trade breaks out and reaches the profit target. Multiplier for the 2nd position = [risk (%) / profit (%)] +2 Multiplier from the 3rd position = [risk (%) / profit (%)] +1  Margin  Due to the fact that the stock indices are traded with a CFD financial product, the respective broker will block a margin when opening a position. This margin can also be viewed as a security deposit. See topic leverage. Due to the effect that by means of using a multiplier and entering into several positions in the same and different directions, the trading account is stressed to the effect that not an infinite number of trades can be opened. The number of maximum trades is set individually by the user as the trades have to be covered by the existing amount of money in the account.  Box size  The use of the SwissBox strategy is reserved for short-term impulse trading. In the markets to be traded, care is taken to ensure that the volatility is high enough to allow the trades to run quickly into the profit target. Good results were achieved with the Dax, but other markets such as FTSE 100 Index, Dow Jones, S&P; 500 Index, Nasdaq and the major currency pairs are also suitable for use. The so-called box size or line spacing of the area to be defined is in a range that is not too small or too large, as one has to take into account both the spread and the volatility. Accordingly, different markets have different box sizes. As a common rule for the minimum box size, a distance of 15 times the spread is recommended. The markets should have an average daily volatility of about five times the minimum box size.  Statistical advantage  Basically, the trader cannot make a profit in the long term with the random positioning of breakout areas (boxes). In a fair stochastic process, provided there is unlimited capital, there would be no profit or loss. However, price movements on the stock exchange are not distributed purely at random. This allows areas to be found where major price movements occur. In contrast to classic trading strategies, in which the price direction (rising / falling) is forecast and traded, box trading focuses on the forecasted breakout movement. The direction of the breakout is not relevant due to the multiplication method. In real trading on the stock exchange, there are two additional limiting factors compared to a random experiment. Firstly, the costs of order execution, expressed as the difference between the buy and sell price for order execution (spread) and the actual order fees, and secondly, the capital, which is usually limited. In order to achieve a positive expected value with box trading, the statistical advantage for a breakout must outweigh the costs of trading and the breakout must take place within the maximum possible multiplication (limitation of the available capital). Breakout movements are likely, for example, for the market opening, around market-relevant news as well as at special price marks.

The oeuvre was painted in the early 17th century, possibly in the 1620s, and is currently housed at the National Gallery in Prague. Painting The painting offers a view of a Flemish village under a full moon. The moon is shining on the town from an open spot in the cloudy sky. In the foreground, two horsemen trot their horses towards a bridge on the bottom right, which a family of three is crossing. A monk is feeding his donkey on the bottom left, while two other barefooted and bearded men talk closely to each other to his right. In this painting, Momper regulated the light so as to illuminate the scene from two points and different sources. From the right there pours in moonlight, while a fiery glow radiates on the other side. The figures in the painting might have been realized by Jan Brueghel the Elder, a frequent collaborator of de Momper.

The production starred Andy Griffith who made his television debut in the production. The production was nominated for Emmy Awards for best program of the year and for Alex Segal as the best director in a live series. Plot The play opens with Will Stockdale sitting on a bench and explaining the circumstances under which he was drafted into the military. He plays the Jew's harp and sings as the opening credits play. Will is an unsophisticated \\"plowboy\\" from Georgia. He introduces the audience to the barracks. Irving has been put in charge of the barracks even though, according to Will's understanding, Irving has been \\"sick with ROTC for a whole year.\\" Ben Whitledge, a short, skinny soldier with glasses and an ill-fitting uniform, becomes Stockdale's bunk mate. On learning that Irving's not sick, Will confronts him and \\"busts him up some.\\" Will and Ben are assigned to the air force and take a train to their new barracks. They are assigned to Sgt. King. Will explains to Sgt. King that he and Ben are leaving because they prefer to be in the infantry. Sgt. King assigns Will as the permanent barracks orderly. Will spends a week cleaning, polishing, and painting the entire barracks. The Captain inspects the barracks and has never seen them so clean. Will gives Sgt. King credit for making him permanent barracks orderly. The captain orders Sgt. King to get Will classified. Will goes through classification tests. He then meets with the psychiatrist who is unable to provoke the amiable Will. A WAC captain scolds Will and Ben for rough-housing. Will can't believe there's a women's air force. Ben tells Will he shouldn't notice whether a captain is a man or a woman. When Sgt. King points out the new captain, Will says he doesn't see a woman, just a captain. Sgt. King worries that Will has failed the eye test. Sgt. King has the men carry Will out of the barracks to the Purple Grotto bar where they try to get the \\"guest of honor\\" drunk. Will is accustomed to drinking moonshine laced with kerosene and stays sober as Sgt. King gets drunk instead. Will returns to the barracks and helps Ben prepare for inspection. As the Colonel conducts his inspection, a drunk Sgt. King returns and is confronted by the Colonel. Will and Ben are assigned to gunnery school. Sgt. King is demoted to private and assigned to gunnery school with Will.

She performed throughout Europe and the United States, and was known for her skill playing the flute, piccolo and violin. Early Life She was born Hannah Rosetta Dinah Moulton in 1860, Clerkenwell, illegitimate daughter of Rosetta Moulton (b 1833). In 1861 she was living at Hermes Street, Clerkenwell. In 1871 she had been adopted and lived with the family of her aunt, Caroline Parks, and her husband Henry Thomas Parks (1823-1903), \\"Professor of Flute\\", in Leyton, Essex.England and Wales Census, 1871\\", database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VFFJ-L68 : 28 September 2019), Hannah D R Parks in entry for Henry T Parks, 1871. Career She was performing in Music Halls from as early as 1879, including touring the United States in 1880 for two years with M. B. Leavitt's Grand English Operatic Burlesque Company, where she \\"played concerts in 178 towns in America\\". Later in 1882 she appeared at the Opera Comique with Lila Clay and her Musical and Dramatic Company of Ladies, described as \\"one of the greatest, if not the chief, success of the opening section of the entertainment. This was a thoroughly legitimate performance, and the spontaneous manner in which the audience cheered and encored it testified to its effectiveness\\". She studied under her father and completed her education at the Guildhall School of Music, performing in student concerts in 1884, where she \\"fairly astonished her hearers by her facility of execution in a flute fantasia, but this lady can scarcely be called a student.\\" There she studied under Richard Shepherd Rockstro (1826-1906), solo flutist at Covent Garden Opera and author of several books on the flute. Her first performance was at the Royal Music Hall, Holborn, then at the Oxford, and the Royal Aquarium. She then gave concerts in Prince's Hall (17 February, 1885) and then toured in Britain and Europe. Early in her career she was described as a 'Musical Novelty' or 'Musical Eccentrics'; a reviewer in 1885 wrote that she was \\"the best of female flautists\\" and \\"is the most modest instrumentalist we have ever encountered; in fact, the absence of self-assertion in her character has done nothing to assist her career.\\" A guest performance in the Berlin Reichshallentheater in 1886 was apparently regarded as one of the highlights of her career, \\"where her engagement was extended for 28 performances\\". She also appeared in Nice. An article in The Musical Herald and Tonic Sol-Fa Reporter by John Curwen in 1889 called her 'The Queen of Flute Players' and described how she always performed from memory. \\"Her performances, a music hall manager said, were appreciated by him because they helped to raise the music halls above the level of clever comic singers and acrobats. Miss Cardigan was so successful that her services were retained for upwards of fifty successive nights at the Royal Aquarium, and she has been heard in almost every large town in the Kingdom‚Äú. She appeared at the opening of the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in 1885, the Bow and Bromley recitals and at the opening of the Metropolitan Theatre in 1897. In 1891 she performed for the Prince of Wales. She later performed works composed by her husband and performed with him at the Theatre Royal, Richmond. Her playing was remarkable for brilliancy of execution, and purity of tone. She was described as \\"Probably the most famous of all English lady flute players‚Äù. Rockstro wrote \\"The excellent and brilliant performer Miss Cora Cardigan ( Mrs. Louis Honig ), known as the 'Queen of Flute-Players' always plays on an ebonite flute. The charming quality of the tone that this talented lady elicits from her instrument is too well known to need any panegyric in these pages.\\" Another reviewer wrote \\"I have heard a lady flautist ‚Äì Miss Cora Cardigan ‚Äì on several occasions. I heard her play some most difficult pieces in excellent style, and I am still waiting to listen to a better performer‚Äú (Musical Opinion and Music Trade Review 1889, Oct., S. 29). She seems to have stopped performing about 1908. In some of her last performances she appeared with her daughter Pauline and stepdaughter Marguerite Honig. Personal Life She married the composer and pianist Louis Honig (1849-1906) at St John the Divine, Richmond on 14 January 1889. Their daughters were Pauline (b 1889) and Lucy (1891-1892).

It was Haggard's first novel and the first of many involving his protagonist Colonel Charles Russell, the head of the urbane unobtrusive but lethal Security Executive, a government counter-intelligence agency clearly based on the actual MI5 or Security Service, who moves easily and gracefully along C.P. Snow's Corridors of Power in Whitehall. Like most of the other works by Haggard and some by his near contemporaries Victor Canning and Michael Gilbert, it is both a standard novel of suspense and a semi-political thriller about the reactions of those in high government positions who scent potential danger to their own political standing from the on-going events of the novel. Plot Protagonist is perhaps too strong a word to describe Colonel Russell. As Haggard himself wrote about his fiction: > My novels are chiefly novels of suspense with a background of international > politics. A Colonel Charles Russell of the Security Executive, a not > entirely imaginary British counter-espionage organization, while not a > protagonist in the technical sense, holds the story line together in the > background by his operations, while the characters in the foreground carry > the action.\\"From the back flap of the dust jacket of the Walker and Company > American edition of The Conspirators, New York, 1967 Nuclear Development, a British agency headed by a top scientist named William Nichol, has developed a valuable new source of atomic power called Slow Burner. Very small quantities of it can generate vast amounts of power, and, rather than needing enormous industrial plants to contain it once developed, useful quantities can be carried about in containers no larger than a suitcase. Unless properly handled, however, it emits deadly epsilon rays. It has, nevertheless, recently been successfully installed in a number of English factories and is now considered by the British Government to be a vital part of the country's future. Nichol and Colonel Russell of the Security Executive are surprised and upset to be informed by Sir Jeremy Bates, a very senior Permanent Secretary, that intermittent readings of epsilon rays are being detected as coming from a modest private home in the London suburb of Dipley. Nichol and Russell are old friends, but Nichol is detested by Sir Jeremy, primarily from jealousy, and much of the book, rather than becoming a standard suspense thriller, is devoted to detailed examinations of the feelings and motivations of the two men. A third personality, a senior scientist who works under Nichol, is discovered by the Security Executive to be the probable person to have planted the epsilon-ray emitter in the house, but Sir Jeremy, for complicated reasons of his own, refuses to move against him. Sir Jeremy, in fact, we now see gradually losing his mind from his all-consuming hatred of William Nichol, and eventually there are two different attempts at murder. Russell is both a highly skilled and highly ethical head of his department and carries out his investigations with dispatch and intelligence but, also having an inbred fear of over-suspicion, he finds himself on the wrong side of the argument with his chief assistant, Major Mortimer, about several essential events. In the end, however, he cheerfully concludes that he himself was wrong and that Mortimer was right‚Äîan important indication of just why Charles Russell is the perfect man to be holding down his key position in the government.

It is located at the intersection of FM 917, approximately northeast of Cleburne. Marystown is part of the Joshua Independent School District.  History  The area was settled by Reverend J.S Wilshire in 1853. The family established a farm before being followed by other settlers. It wasn't until after the Civil War, when Thomas W. Hollingworth established a flour mill, that the community became organized. The town was initially named Marysville in honor of Thomas' wife, however when a post office was applied for, it was discovered that a Marysville already existed, and so the community was renamed Marystown. The post office was in operation from 1874 to 1901. By 1879, the population was at 100, and the community featured a cotton gin, flour mill, gristmill, a general store and two grocery stores. There was also a school and two churches, one of which was built by Hollingworth himself. When the railroad was constructed in 1881, it bypassed Marystown causing residents to relocate to the nearby town of Burleson. The community ceased to exist in an organized form around 1901, when the school had 117 students being taught by two teachers.

The hospital was used as a medical training facility, a model for military field hospitals, and for long-term treatment of patients.  Columbia Oval  The property that the hospital was built on was an athletic field owned by Columbia University called called \\"Columbia Oval\\". The property, located in what was then considered part of the Williamsbridge neighborhood, but is now part of the Norwood neighborhood. Columbia Oval was the finish line of the first marathon within the United States, which was won by John McDermott in 1896, a year before he won the first Boston Marathon in 1897.  Columbia War Hospital  The Columbia War Hospital was conceived by the head of Columbia‚Äôs Department of Urology, J.

U.S. Army General Hospital No. 1  The hospital was renamed by the army to \\"United States Army General Hospital No. 1\\" in August, 1917. The hospital was transferred over to Colonel E. R. Schreiner of the United States Army on October 3, 1917 in a ceremony conducted by Columbia university's president Nicholas Murray Butler.  Additional facilities  The hospital had additional facilities in: * The Montefiore Home, (Norwood, Bronx), located across the street from the hospital, provided accommodations for military officers at a newly created facility called \\"Van Cortlandt Private Hospital\\". * The Messiah Home for Children, 1771 Andrews Avenue University Heights, Bronx, and the adjacent Camp Estate , both provided by the Catholic War Council with a nominal rent of $1 per month. * Bloomingdale Hospital (in White Plains, New York)  Later history  The hospital was closed on October 15, 1919. After the end of the Great War, the 54 buildings that made up the Columbia Oval site were razed. Former patients who required long-term care after the closing of the hospital were transferred to the care of Montefiore Medical Center. In October 1922 the 19 acre site was auctioned by the university for a total of $351,950 as 225 separate lots. ($5,445,127.39 in 2020 US dollars per www.usinflationcalculator.com.)

The fuselage shrank to a short forward cockpit nacelle. The engines were placed quite close together inside the wing, with intakes in the roots and the otherwise straight trailing edge cut back for the exhausts. The wing planform was a cropped delta of moderate sweep. Small twin fins were located either side of the trailing edge cutback. Construction of a full-scale mock-up began in 1943. =Delta VI= By the time work on an experimental prototype was begun, the project had become the Delta VI.

Moran was a prominent landscape, architectural, astronomical and expedition photographer whose career began in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area during the 1860s. A brother of the painters Thomas, Edward and Peter Moran, Moran was a member of a network of Philadelphia-based artists, historians, and scientists who recognized photography as a fine art in the years before the Civil War. Biography John Moran at Harbor Town, Tasmania, December 1874 while leader of the US Transit of Venus Expedition John Moran was born during February 1831 at Bolton le Moors, Lancashire, England, the third of Mary (n√©e Higson) and Thomas Moran's eight children. At the age of 13, he arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the passenger ship Thomas on May 31, 1844, having traveled with his mother and then six siblings. Moran was the one photographer among his accomplished siblings. Brothers Thomas, Edward and Peter trained as lithographers and became painters. Moran's sister Elizabeth married an artist and her two sons became painters. By the early 1890s, Moran resumed painting, joining his brothers Edward and Thomas in New York City where he wrote about art and exhibited his paintings. A widower, living with his son Thomas Sidney Moran, he died there in 1902. Moran's 1902 obituary in The New York Times mentioned Moran's role as \\"one of the pioneer photographers of this country\\". Advocate of photography as an artistic medium John Moran, View near Chipigana, 1871, Albumen silver print - Digital image courtesy of the Getty's Open Content Program As early as the 1850s, Moran was a pioneer in advancing photography as a medium of artistic expression. Moran said \\"In photography, as in any work of art, the merit lies, in the power of seeing and deciding what shall be done...It is this knowledge, or art of seeing which gives value and importance to the works of certain photographers over others. There are hundreds who make, chemically, faultless photographs, but few make pictures...\\" Moran understood photography could achieve more than merely recording a moment, saying in 1865 \\"She (photography) can present imagery with a reality and force nearly rivaling the painter, and in some respects, superior.\\" ‚ÄúBut it is the power of seeing and deciding what shall be done, on which will depend the value and importance of any work, whether canvas or negative.‚Äù Moran said \\"Art in all its forms is the form of thought, and the photographic work which rises to this plane is the expression of the ideas of the photographer. Nature... becomes plastic to his touch, and he moulds her to his judgment through (the photographer's) power to see the beautiful.\\" Pioneer artistic photographer John Moran, Limon Bay, High Tide, 1871, Albumen silver print - Digital image courtesy of the Getty's Open Content Program Moran is listed in local Philadelphia directories as a lithographer in 1856, occasionally listing his profession as artist. He appears as a photographer from 1860 through 1885. Moran was an early advocate of photography as art. His albumen silver print landscape photographs often appeared as frontispieces in Wilson's Philadelphia Photographer from 1864 to 1866. Moran often created photographic images working alongside his brother Thomas as his brother painted the same subject view. Moran's photographs were images that balanced meticulous attention to detail with general atmospheric effects ‚Äî techniques mirrored in his brother's paintings. Moran often included a human subject in his images, providing the viewer an easily relatable sense of scale. It is felt Moran was a humanistic, Arcadian photographer, employing his photographs of nature in a metaphorical way. The National Gallery of Art (US) said in 2016: \\"It is thought John Moran photographed \\"Wissahickon Creek near Philadelphia\\" (c. 1863) as an antidote to Civil War.\\" Moran was mentioned often in the photographic press in America and Europe for both the aesthetic and technical quality of his photographs, and his theories on the medium. In addition to single photographic views, Moran also photographed many stereoscope photographs. Moran's images were printed on stereographic cards that were widely distributed and viewed using the newly developed stereograph. =Mower General Hospital= Moran created a photographic catalog of Mower General Hospital also known as Chestnut Hill Hospital for a series that he published for sale. Moran's photos were issued as both mounted photographs and stereographs soon after the facility was completed. The hospital, a major military facility, was built in 1862 on a lot of 27 acres, situated between Stenton, Germantown, Springfield and Abington avenues in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill. Moran photographed a series of views of the hospital's innovatively-designed circular layout. Moran's exterior and interior views included photos of special medical wards that could be isolated for patients with infections and then novel centralized storage facilities for supplies. Pioneer scientific photographer In addition to using photography as an artistic medium, Moran was recruited and hired as a photographer documenting scientific projects for the US government. A stereograph showing a man sitting at the base of a tree in a tropical rain forest in Panama taken by John Moran at Woods, Darien Harbor, Isthmus of Panama, 1871 =Isthmus of Panama Expedition of 1871= In 1871, Moran was hired as the official photographer during the second survey to the Isthmus of Darien in Panama, led by US Navy Commodore Thomas Oliver Selfridge Jr. to determine the best route for a canal across the isthmus. Moran documented the trip with numerous still photographs, including many stereographs which were widely reproduced and sold throughout the world. =Transit of Venus photographic expedition of 1874= Photographic print showing the Transit of Venus across the Sun, taken December 8, 1874 at Honolulu station Four times during every 243 years, Venus passes between the Sun and Earth allowing its silhouette to be observed by skilled and amateur astronomers around the world. The transit of Venus occurs in pairs. The first of the pair that took place in the 1800s occurred on December 9, 1874. Moran served as Chief Photographer on the US expedition to Australia, one of the eight American teams to join the 1874 international scientific effort to record the Transit of Venus across the sun, which would allow scientists to more accurately establish the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The effort helped unravel one of the primary mysteries of Solar System astronomy, the true value of the astronomical unit. Moran sent back reports of his travels to the Philadelphia Photographer. Even though clouds and intermittent rain covered the sky at his station at Barrack Square in Hobart Town, Tasmania, Moran and his team in Australia brought back over 300 photographic documents, including 125 images of the Transit of Venus. The photographic equipment selected by the US expedition was the American Optical Company's \\"Venus Camera Box\\". The unit used a special negative plate holder that allowed the photographer to take multiple exposures in register. Able to slide both vertically and horizontally, the holder employed pins that fit into a series of stepped registration holes. In order to create scientifically useful multiple exposures, the process required three photographers, one to expose the sensitized glass, one to move the glass, registering it with the pins and one to note the time of each successive exposure using a chronometer. Two sizes of plates were used. The large plates were exposed every 54 seconds. The smaller plates were exposed at a rate of 1.9 second intervals. Later career In the late nineteenth century, the dry photographic plate was perfected. It replaced the wet collodion process Moran had used for years. He apparently lost interest in photography and resumed painting as a creative outlet. Artistic legacy After 1865, the art of John Moran \\"disappeared\\" into collections of photographic prints and historic documents. His seminal artistic photographs were \\"one-off\\" (individually hand printed and mounted) albumen prints and therefore limited in quantity. Original John Moran prints are over 150 years old and now quite rare. Moran's photographs pre-dated rotogravure and halftone print reproduction, so his work was not able to be known by the public on a mass-market scale. Later photographers like Alfred Steiglitz greatly benefitted from having their work printed in magazines, art books and other publications. Consequently, photographers who followed Moran became better known to the public. Moran has been overlooked for decades. =Auction history= Moran's pioneering body of nineteenth-century early photography is being rediscovered, appreciated and collected. In 2010, Christie's New York auction house sold a Moran albumen silver print showing the demolition of the Bank of Pennsylvania. The sale price at $32,000 (), set a new auction record for an original John Moran print.

Vira, or Wira, is a traditional Swedish card game for three players that game designer, Dan Glimne, has called \\"Sweden's national card game\\".  History  Playing Vira was a popular social pastime during the 19th century and there are still Vira parties in Sweden. It is unclear when the game arose. According to tradition, the game was invented in Vira courthouse around 1810. It is said that a terrible storm caused the court to become snowbound inside and they could not leave the mill. So they played card games and eventually invented a new one, which was named after the place. Two gentlemen of Walloon extraction are supposed be the inventors of the game. But since Vira is a game for three, a third party was probably involved.  Description  Vira is a trick-taking game. The actual trick play is preceded by an auction, as in Bridge. The player who bids the highest contract plays against the other two players. Vira is a very complicated card game and there are several variants of the rules. It is played with gaming chips of which there are three or four different types. The stakes are placed in a so-called virapulla (pictured). The dealer deals 13 cards each. Then an auction takes place in which there are 40 contracts to choose from. The one who announces the highest contract becomes the declarer; the other two become the defenders. After the auction, the declarer may 'buy' cards from the talon in a procedure called the 'purchase' (k√∂pet). Then the trick-taking game begins. When play is finished, the 'payment' (betalningen) follows. Here, the declarer either gets paid in chips or has to pay chips to the opponents depending on what bid the declarer made and how the game went. Then the next round begins.

Located in White Point Garden, the monument depicts Sergeant William Jasper and was dedicated in 1877 to all South Carolina militiamen involved in the Battle of Sullivan's Island during the American Revolutionary War.  History  The Battle of Sullivan's Island was a 1776 battle in the American Revolutionary War that took place near Charleston, South Carolina. During the battle, the flagpole holding the regimental colors was destroyed by enemy gunfire, and Sergeant William Jasper climbed the ramparts while under enemy fire and held up the flag until it could be reattached. Following the battle, a victory for the Continental Army, Jasper was commended for his heroic actions by both his superiors, including President of South Carolina John Rutledge. The battle itself was considered a \\"Bunker Hill of the South.\\" Around the centennial of this event, plans were underway to create a monument to honor the South Carolinians involved in the battle. By the battle's centennial on June 28, 1876, the large granite base of the monument had been installed, with the bronze statue of Jasper being added by next year. The Palmetto Guard, a military company in Charleston, held the dedication ceremonies on June 28, 1877, first travelling to nearby Middleton Place before returning to the city for the dedication. The name for the monument, The Defenders of Fort Moultrie, is anachronistic, as the fort at the time of the battle was known as Fort Sullivan.  Design  The monument consists of a bronze sculpture of Jasper upon a granite pedestal. The sculpture depicts the Continental soldier with his right arm outstretched, pointing towards Fort Moultrie, with the Moultrie flag in his left hand. Bronze plates are attached to the pedestal and show the Seal of South Carolina, the seal of Charleston, and a battle scene showing Jasper's rescue of the flag. Additional inscriptions are found on the granite base, and the plate in the front says: The base is high and the statue is high.

She famously disrupted the 1908 Dundee by- election by ringing a bell every time Winston Churchill attempted to address a crowd.  1908 Dundee by-election  Dundee experienced a comparatively high amount of suffrage activity in 1908. due to the then prime minister, H.H.

However, they were upstaged by the non-violent Women's Freedom League member Mary Maloney who came up from London for the campaign. Whenever Churchill spoke, Maloney produced a swinging dinner bell which drowned out what he was saying. The ding-dong exchanges were taken in fun initially, but some meetings had to be cancelled because of the uproar. The Irish Times newspaper published an account of the by-election on 5 May 1908 that supported claims that Maloney had followed Churchill around for a week. \\"[Maloney] complained of a passage in a speech which the latter delivered on Saturday last, and in which, alluding to the women‚Äôs suffrage movement, he said ‚Äì ‚ÄúI have seen with some regret some most earnest advocates of the cause allying themselves with the forces of drink and reaction.

After studying at the ETH Zurich and working for architect Peter Zumthor, Conzett started his own civil engineering office in 1988. Perhaps his best known works are a series of three pedestrian bridges located on the trail of the Viamala in Switzerland. Though many of Conzett's works are in Switzerland, he has designed bridges elsewhere. Biography J√ºrg Conzett was born on 28 September 1956 in Aarau, Canton of Aargau, Switzerland. His father was a surveyor. Conzett cites Swiss cartographer Eduard Imhof as an early influence. He is also interested in and inspired by the Baroque, such as works by the Grubenmann brothers, 18th-century Swiss engineers. In 1975 Conzett began studying civil engineering at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne and ETH Zurich, gaining his diploma in 1980. From 1980 until 1987 he worked in the office of Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. In 1988 Conzett started his own civil engineering office in Haldenstein. In 1992 the office became Branger & Conzett AG, and in 1996 Branger Conzett und Partner AG. In 1998 Conzett partnered with Gianfranco Bronzini and Patrick Gartmann to form Conzett Bronzini Gartmann AG in Chur. Gartmann left the firm in 2015, and its name changed to Conzett Bronzini Partner AG. Conzett is Chairman of the Board of Directors and in charge of building and bridge construction projects at Conzett Bronzini Partner AG. Between 1987 and 2004 he lectured on timber construction at the Fachhochschule Graub√ºnden (Graub√ºnden University of Applied Sciences). In 2015 he was a visiting professor at Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Works Perhaps Conzett's best known works are a series of three pedestrian bridges located on the trail of the Viamala. The first was a wood-and-rope truss bridge known as the Traversinersteg I, completed in 1996 but destroyed in a March 1999 rockslide. The first Traversinersteg was prefabricated as a single assembly and lifted into place by what was then Switzerland's most powerful helicopter. The second bridge‚ÄîTraversinersteg II, a wood and steel cable suspension bridge with large concrete abutments that spans vertically and horizontally‚Äîreplaced the first in 2005. The third is a granite slab and steel cable stressed ribbon bridge called P√πnt da Suransans located near Thusis. Built in 1999, the P√πnt da Suransans crosses the Hinterrhein River in the shadow of the Great Viamala Bridge, a viaduct of the A13 motorway designed by Christian Menn. Though many of Conzett's works are in Switzerland, he has designed bridges elsewhere. One such bridge‚Äî a pedestrian and cycle vertical-lift bridge spanning over the Coupure canal in Bruges, Belgium, and built in 2002‚Äîwas even named the Conzettbrug () in his honor. Conzett collaborates with architects and other building professionals on building projects. One such project is the Mehrzweckhalle Vrin, a multipurpose hall built in Vrin in 1995 and designed in collaboration with architect Gion A. Caminada.

In the book, Gedgaudas talks about his theory that the Balts, or Lithuanians, inhabited a large part of Europe and that the Goths, Vandals and Veneti were actually a Baltic people. To prove his theory, he references many sources, often comparing words and place names in different languages with the Lithuanian language.  Part One  = Instead of an introduction = ƒåeslovas Gedgaudas begins with the phrase \\"Give me strength\\" in runes and prays to the pagan god, entitling him as: * \\"God of ≈Ωemaitians and Auk≈°taitians\\" () * \\"Ruler of Prussians, Galindians, and Curonians\\" () * \\"Almighty of the Liauduvians, Sƒósnians, Tautonians, Tauringians, Varulians\\" () * \\"Protector of the Vandals\\" () * \\"Guide of the Aesti and Upeningians\\" () * \\"King of the Visigoths\\" () * \\"Grand Kunigas of the Yotvingians, Varangians, and Rus\\" () * \\"Judge of the ancient High Rikiai\\" () * \\"Lord of the Krivians and Krivaitians\\" () * \\"Marshal of Vytis' Banners\\" () * \\"Creator of the Liela Tauroja\\" () In his prayer, Gedgaudas calls on him for knowledge, truth, and help, when revealing the old untold truths. He laments that his words are too weak to remind the military undertakings of the hillfort giants, the science of the star-gazers, the insight of the oracles, and the hard-working and creative hands of the \\"bright [Lithuanian] nation\\". He continues, writing that: > Although ages have passed, the mysterious body of the Miraculous Serpent, > chopped into the smallest pieces, is still moving, covering itself in a > bloodbath; the Crusader's hand still shakes, and he worries in his heart: > \\"Hath I not shattered you enough - maybe it will revitalize?\\" Our language's > monuments still glow proudly, scattered as if diamonds on three continents, > and are witnesses to an age, when demigods walked on land and gave the first > names to cities and rivers, mountains and seas. According to him, archives contain many ancient writings, who are constantly denied and destroyed by \\"the enemies of our [Lithuanian] culture\\". Furthermore, he complains about how history is distorted, as unearthed discoveries are always appropriated by the current inhabitants on that land. The prayer ends with Gedgaudas calling on the \\"Lord of Battles\\" to help him restore the truth \\"with the unearthed swords\\" and asking the Lord to remember and forgive his nation, even if it has long forgotten Him. = Why do we know so little about our glorious past? = Gedgaudas critiques the fact that the rule of Mindaugas is considered akin to ancient history in Lithuania, whilst Western Europe already had extensive archives onwards from the 5th century. He poses the question why only a few pages are dedicated to the centuries prior to Mindaugas when up to three millennia of Lithuanian history could be restored based on the Western, Rus, Byzantine, Arabian, Scandinavian, and many other numerous sources. According to Gedgaudas, this ignored history is often unmentioned, and when it is mentioned, it is toned down to a child's level of understanding and described using stereotyped templates. Yet, pre-Vytautas Lithuanian history was very complex and reaches so far back, it could be analysed inexhaustibly. He blames the lack of exploration into the ancient times on religious, political, scientific, and democratic taboos.  Religious taboo  He considers the Baltic Crusades as a genocide conducted by the Catholic Church, comparable to that conducted by conquistadors in Central and Southern Americas. For example, the Pope Honorius III had threatened to excommunicate the Pomeranian Duke ≈†ventupuolis, because he cooperated with \\"the infernal Lithuanians\\" (). Moreover, the Crusaders, after crushing one of the Prussian uprisings, slew open the belly of the captured Prussian king Paupinis (Pipin, similar to Visigothic Pepin), nailed his intestines to the sacred oak, and forced him to run around the tree, and after a few circles, he collapsed. The writer points out that that the genealogy of the Lithuanian ancient kings was labelled the \\"Book of Belial's children\\" (), which shows that the Catholic Church was clearly hostile to Lithuanians. Gedgaudas writes that viewing the atrocities committed in the Crusades against pagan Balts as genocide would lead to civil strife in Lithuania. Hence, in order to not upset the Catholic Church and its followers, the crimes committed in its name are glossed over and the pagan faith is degraded to an uncivilized religion. However, he points out that paganism's primitiveness is refuted by the forty-page section in the Encyclop√¶dia of Religion and Ethics dedicated to the Aryan religion, which interweaves Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and Baltic cultures, which, unfortunately, referred to the fact that there is a lack of research with regards to Baltic linguistics.  Political taboo   Scientific taboo   Democratic taboo  = In the search for the origin Lithuania's name = = In the search for the origin of the Lithuanian state = = In the search for the origin of Slavs = = In the search for the origin of Lithuanians = Gedgaudas proposes that the word Aisƒçiai (Aesti), with which the Balts call themselves (the word is related to the Latvian words Ists or Istenieks, meaning companion or consanguineous), was a cognate of the Lithuanian verb eiti, which means \\"go, walk\\", and of Greek Aistos and Slavic Aisr, ancient names for storks which are migratory birds. He derived Vandal from Vanduoliai, or \\"inhabitants of a place with water\\" (from vanduo, which means \\"water\\" in Lithuanian).  Part Two - Having found the Chronicle of ≈Ωiniavaldas  Gedgaudas accepted the authenticity of the works of the historian Hinnibaldus on the Franks in the 5th century, who said that the Trojan War happened in 1179 B.C. Gedgaudas, upon seeing in the names of Frankish kings an indication of their closeness to the Baltic peoples, identified the Franks with the Cimmerians (although the original text is lost, there is a partial copy, including a summary of the works of Johannes Trithemius). He defended the theory that the Hyperborean gods in Greco-Roman mythology (Apollo, the Muses, Latvia, Thetis, Diana, Ganymede Proteus, Ceres, and Ares) had Baltic origins. Based on the studies of Theodor Mommsen (Monumenta Germaniae Historica) and Alfred Gutschmit (Untersuchungen √úber die Geschichte), Gedgaudas developed a chronology of the expansion of the Goths. He dated the first great Goth expedition (the departure from Scandinavia and the conquest of Gothiscan√ßia) as happening in the year 1490 B.C., during the reign of Bueric.  Part Three - Hymn about the Amber Road  Part Four - Censored Past  Gedgaudas attributed the Godo to the Baltic word Gaudas, \\"the subject that catches\\", from the word Gaudo, \\"catch\\", which could mean \\"the one who catches the beef\\", a cattleman, or \\"the one who catches a slave\\", a warrior.Cited by Rosales, J., Los Godos. Barcelona, 2004, p. 304. The Gothic conquest of Scythia would have begun in 1324 B.C. with King Pilimer. The Gothic arrival in India, under King Thanauso, would have occurred sometime after 1290 B.C.  Part Five - The Renounced God  Gedgaudas suggested that the alphabet used by Romuva priests, since lost, was a runic alphabet, making this conclusion from the Lithuanian word Rantyti, Ranto, meaning \\"to record\\" and \\"to speak\\" in Latvian.  Part Six - Conclusions   Publications  The book was first published in 1972 in Mexico City, and then republished in Lithuania in 1994 and 2018.

The building was constructed in about 1500, in the grounds of Micklegate Priory and facing onto Micklegate, one of the main streets in York. The building does not appear on John Speed's generally accurate map of the city in 1610, which has led to an argument that it was constructed after this date; but stylistic features, such as the double-jettying on the front and the crown post roof, point to an earlier date, and Speed's omission may have been in order to show the buildings associated with the priory more clearly. It is likely that the building was constructed to be rented out and provide more income for the priory. Its division into three properties is original, and originally each property had a single room on each of the three floors. Stairs appear to have originally been in annexes at the back of the buildings, but about 1600 a wing was added at the back of number 89, while in the 18th century one was added to number 87. Around 1660, the building was rendered to improve its weatherproofing. From at least the early 18th century, the properties were occupied by butchers. The current ground-floor shop windows are Victorian. The building was listed in 1954, but by 1967 it was in poor condition. It was restored by the Ings Property Company, the process including the removal of the external rendering, and it is now owned by the York Conservation Trust.

Nidingen is a Swedish Kattegat sea area skerry with a lighthouse station. It is located in Onsala parish in Kungsbacka Municipality in the province (landskap) of Halland. The island has with its surrounding reefs always posed a danger to shipping. The three lighthouses on the island, one of which is active, is today protected as heritage buildings. The island is also a nature reserve with a birding station and hostel, famous for large populations of different bird species. The province of Halland and Nidingen was ruled by Denmark until the Second Treaty of Br√∂msebro 1645. The Danes had lit primitive navigation fires on the island before, and also built a \\"vippefyr\\", but now it became one of Sweden's earliest light stations. In the 18th century, the vippefyr was replaced by fires placed on stone cairns, which in turn were replaced by two new stone towers in 1834. They were built even higher in 1847 and were equipped with lanterns and fresnel lenses. In 1884, the colza oil lamps were replaced by kerosene lamps with improved luminosity. The historic lighthouses was in use until 1946 when a new modern tower was completed. The lighthouse was electrified through a connection with cable from the mainland. In the 1960s, the lighthouse's lens equipment was electrified. In 1973, an automatic rotation of the lens was installed around the clock while the lighting of the lamps was controlled by photocells.

It was outlined in a fifty-minute speech delivered on 19 March, 1952, by General Templer to the Federal Legislative Council of Malaya. The Plan contained eighteen points on various social, economic, and political issues facing Malaya in light of the Malayan Emergency and as the nation prepared itself for self-government and eventually independence from the British. Several of the points were already covered in The Draft Development Plan of the Federation of Malaya 1950‚Äì55 which failed to be implemented due to The Malayan Emergency. It would serve as General Templer‚Äôs blueprint for governing the country during his two-year tenure as High Commissioner and Director of Operations of Malaya from 1952 to 1954. The Templer Plan was based on an original Directive issued by the British Government named Directive issued to General Sir Gerald Walter Robert Templer, K.C.B., K.B.E., C.M.G., D.S.O., A.D.C., High Commissioner in and for the Federation of Malaya, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom on 1 February, 1952. Prior to delivering his speech on 19 March, 1952, General Templer sent a draft of his speech for vetting to Oliver Lyttelton, the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the United Kingdom. Lyttelton approved the speech and stated it was ‚Äúentirely in accord with Her Majesty‚Äôs Government‚Äôs policy‚Äù. The Plan was noteworthy for the breadth of the topics it covered, ranging from the contentious issue of citizenship that ultimately caused the downfall of the Malayan Union just four years earlier, to developing a national education system that would protect the rights of the ethnic Chinese in Malaya.  Background  Following the end of World War 2, the British Colonial Government in Malaya faced a communist insurgency led by Chin Peng, the leader of the Malayan Communist Party. This was called the Malayan Emergency. While the first two years of the Emergency was marked by poor decision making and little progress being made against the communists, the situation improved drastically with the implementation of the Briggs Plan of 1950 which contained a forced resettlement program that effectively separated the MCP from its support base, the Min Yuen. However, on 6 October, 1951, the previous British High Commissioner to Malaya Sir Henry Gurney was murdered in an ambush attack by communist insurgents. Soon after, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill tasked Secretary of State for the Colonies Oliver Lyttelton with the task of finding a suitable replacement for Gurney. Lyttelton did not immediately settle on General Templer; his initial first choice was General Sir Brian Robertson who declined the offer as he wanted to spend more time in the United Kingdom after spending the previous twenty-eight out of thirty-one years abroad. Lyttelton eventually settled on Templer for his relative youth and wide experience commanding abroad.  Preparation of The Templer Plan  Templer was originally unclear on what his main objective as British High Commissioner should be. > ‚ÄúThe general object is obvious ‚Äî viz., to restore law and order, and to > bring back peace to the Federation [of Malaya]. I am clear as to what must > happen from the purely military point of view. I am not at all clear as to > what H.M.G. is aiming for from the political point of view. Is it a ‚Äòunited > Malayan nation‚Äô? And if so, what exactly does this mean? Does it mean a > merging of Malays and Chinese in one community ‚Äî a long term project? I must > have a clear policy to work on. I want to be given a directive from H.M.G. > not so that I should shelter behind that directive ‚Äî but rather that I can > use it to publicly impress H.M.G‚Äôs purposes‚Ä¶‚Äù The British government responded quickly to his request and issued Directive issued to General Sir Gerald Walter Robert Templer, K.C.B., K.B.E., C.M.G., D.S.O., A.D.C., High Commissioner in and for the Federation of Malaya, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, which contained eight key points in respect to the scope of his role as High Commissioner and Director of Operations in Malaya in addition to underlining the British government‚Äôs official goal for Malaya to ‚Äúin due course become a fully self-governing nation‚Äù. Additionally, in a press interview by the Colonial Secretary, it was stated that > ‚ÄúThere will be no field of administration, civil, or military, beyond his > control‚Ä¶. The Government remains convinced that making headway against the > Communists is as much as a political as a military task, and they are giving > the new High Commissioner instructions which lay stress upon the > constitutional and political development of the Federation‚Äù. Thus, it was made clear that General Templer‚Äôs role in Malaya was as military in so far as it was political ‚Äî Templer was to defeat the communist insurgency while taking the necessary steps to prepare the country for independence.  The Eighteen Points of The Templer Plan  In his speech, General Gerald Templer outlinted eighteen points which he believed to be crucial in Malaya's political and economic development and its ultimate goal in attaining indepdence. # The easing of citizenship rights. # The retraining of the Malayan Police. # The creation of a Malayan Army. # The improvement of medical and health services. # The development of a national education policy. # The importance of land tenure for agriculturalists. # The encouragement of youth movements. # The improvement of the Government‚Äôs informational services. # The importance of progressive political progress. # The strengthening of the economic position of the Malays. # The overhauling of income tax. # The encouragement of industrial development. # The improvement of road communications. # The training of the civil service, both overseas and locally, to equip Malayans for high posts in the Government service. # The importance of economy in financial matters in view of the possibility of a sharp fall in the prices of rubber and tin. # The expansion of electric power resources. # The building up of the economy of the Malays. # The increase of local food production and agricultural output to render the country less dependent upon imports.

Of the 27 people on board, 26 died, and one survived. The aircraft was destroyed. The aircraft had tail number 76 and belonged to the 203rd Training Aviation Brigade (A4104 military unit).  History of the flight  From 18:50 25 September 2020, there were flights on the An-26Sh training of flying and navigating cadets of the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University to gain skills in flying and piloting aircraft. The flights went according to plan and were to last until 10:50 pm. In the time before the crash, the plane had made six successful take-offs and five successful landings. The crew consisted of 7 people. The crew was commanded by Bohdan Kyshenia, an instructor pilot, a second-class pilot who had flown more than 700 hours. The cadets took turns sitting in the right chair to gain piloting skills. According to official data, the following course of events was previously established: * At 20:35 the plane took off from Chuhuiv Air Base and started flying according to the program. * At 20:38 the crew noticed a pressure drop in the left engine torque sensor, which was reported to the air traffic controller, after which it was instructed to land. * At 20:40 the crew made a request to land, but because another plane was boarding at that time, the crew received permission to land a minute after the request. * At 20:43 the aircraft passed the aerodrome's long-range radio beacon, prepared flaps and landing gear, began descent, and reported readiness for landing. * At 20:45 during the approach the plane lost altitude and collided with the ground at a distance of about 1500 m from the air base runway. After that, the plane fuselage caught fire. The plane crashed near the M03 Kyiv-Kharkiv-Dovzhansky highway. The fire, which broke out after the plane crash, was extinguished at 9:55 pm by the State Emergency Service brigades and other the Ministry of Internal Affairs units that arrived on the site. During the crash, the plane nearly hit one of the cars traveling on the highway. Drivers and passengers called rescuers to the crash site and provided first aid to the people who survived the crash: one of them was on fire and extinguished with a fire extinguisher, and the other had a broken head and a cut on his leg, but he was conscious and could speak. Eyewitnesses also reported that the cadets jumped without parachutes. There were 27 people on board ‚Äî 20 cadets of the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University and seven officers. One cadet wasn't allowed to board the flight at the last moment. Twenty-five bodies were found at the crash site. Two cadets survived the accident, but one of them, having received burns to 90% of his body, died on 26 September in an ambulance hospital in Kharkiv. A total of 26 people died in the plane crash - 19 cadets and seven crew members. The bodies of the dead were badly burned and mutilated, and a DNA examination is required to identify them, which will take 2‚Äì3 weeks. One cadet survived and is in the Military Medical Clinical Center of the Northern Region \\"with numerous bruises and concussions.\\". It was later reported that his condition was stable, he had injured his leg and received multiple bruises, but he will soon be discharged from the hospital. He later said that everything happened quickly, \\"like in a computer game,\\" and after he woke up, he helped put out the person who was on fire. Throughout the 25 September evening, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, and the Kharkiv Oblast State Administration called different numbers of people on board the plane at the crash time. The plane wreckage is located at 533-534 kilometers of the M03 Kyiv-Kharkiv-Dovzhansky highway, which complicates the vehicles movement that passes through one free lane. There are no certainties yet as to what caused the plane crash. The Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives suggested that since 2017, at least 10 Antonov An-26 aircraft are said to have crashed. According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Taran, the plane was in good condition, had enough flight resources, but for unknown reasons caught the wing on the ground. According to preliminary estimates, the failure of one of the engine sensors is considered, but the engine itself did not fail. At the same time, the mother of the pilot Ashraf Msuia told journalists that her son said that the plane was not in good condition, and the engines had repeatedly failed.  Aircraft  The An-26Sh (tail number 76, serial number 56-08, issued on 21 October 1977) had a total flight time of 5985 hours and made 3450 landings. In July 1996, it was renovated at the Aircraft Repair Plant 410 (Kyiv). Since the repair time, it has flown 1,800 hours and made 2,160 landings. For aircraft of this type, the service life limit is set at 20,000 flight hours and 14,000 landings. In August 2020, under the Antonov specialists' supervision, the service life was extended until 21 June 2022, and the next overhaul was to take place in July 2022. AI-24VT engines were installed on the plane. The service life of the right engine (released in the fourth quarter of 1974) before the next repair was until 11 October 2020, and the left (released in December 1977) - until 5 June 2021. The plane was ready for flight and no major repairs were planned for 2020. The information on the ProZorro public procurement website, which was published in July 2020, on the conclusion of the contract for the aircraft repair, one of which was the An-26Sh with tail number 76, related to the work performed by Antonov in full and Antonov extended the aircraft service life by two years.  Victims  On 26 September 2020, Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University published on its Facebook page the names of officers and cadets who died in the plane crash. Two people survived the crash, one of them died later in a hospital. A farewell ceremony for 20-year-old cadet Vitaliy Vilkhovy, who died at the hospital from severe injuries in a plane crash, took place on 29 September at the Memorial of Glory in Kharkiv.  Reactions  On 26 September, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky created a commission for investigation of the circumstances of the tragedy and providing all necessary assistance. The State Commission for Investigation of the Circumstances of the Tragedy and Providing All Necessary Assistance to the Victims included: Minister of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Taran, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel-General Ruslan Khomchak, Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov, First Deputy NSDC Secretary Mykhailo Koval, Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Arsen Avakov, Minister of Health Maksym Stepanov, Deputy Head of Office of the President of Ukraine Oleh Tatarov, Head of State Aviation Administration of Ukraine Oleksandr Bilchuk, Chairman of State Emergency Service of Ukraine Mykola Chechotkin, Kharkiv Oblast State Administration Head Oleksiy Kucher and other officials. The State Commission is headed by Deputy Prime Minister Oleh Urusky, Minister of Defense, and deputy head, Andriy Taran. The Mourning Day was declared in Ukraine on 26 September. On 26 September morning, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the crash site, where during a briefing he called to wait for the results of the investigation, and also visited cadet Vyacheslav Zolochevsky, who was the sole survivor of the plane crash. In Kharkiv, citizens carried flowers and lanterns to the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University's main building. On the same day, Zelensky instructed to suspend the flights of all An-26s and their analogues until the crash causes were clarified and to provide information on the technical condition of military equipment. According to the Deputy Office of the President Oleh Tatarov, also on behalf of Zelensky, the Ministry of Internal Affairs must review defense contracts and strengthen control over the criminal investigation in the defense field for the purchase and maintenance of military equipment. The Minister of Defense Andriy Taran has decided to pay one-time financial assistance in the amount of 1,576,000 UAH to the families of the victims of the plane crash, which will be funded by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Condolences were expressed by the Orthodox Church of Ukraine head Metropolitan Epiphanius. = Abroad = Condolences on the tragedy were expressed by the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the EU Vice President and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell, the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, the Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkeviƒçius, the Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkƒìviƒçs, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Ceyhun Bayramov, Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, European Council President Charles Michel and diplomatic missions of the USA, NATO, Norway, Montenegro, Croatia, Austria, Afghanistan, Denmark, Italy, France, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Slovenia, Moldova, Georgia, Romania, Turkey, Sweden, Bulgaria and Albania. Russian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Kirill expressed condolences.  Investigation  The State Bureau of Investigation (DBR) and the Office of the Prosecutor General launched a pre-trial investigation into the military aircraft crash for violating flight rules and preparing for them, which caused a catastrophe and severe consequences (Article 416 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The State Bureau of Investigation considered such probable causes of the crash: a technical malfunction, a pilot error, errors in flight control, and the aircraft's improper maintenance. A version of the terrorist attack is also being considered. Also, the Kharkiv Oblast State Administration head Oleksiy Kucher insists on a thorough investigation into the priority of landing another plane. At the accident scene, DBR began investigative actions with the involvement of relevant specialists - a total of 50 investigators worked. More than 50 examinations were also ordered. Surviving flight recorders were found and sent for deciphering. The planes' large wreckage was transported from the crash site to a special site on the territory of the 203rd Aviation Training Brigade for examination by specialists. During an emergency government meeting, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal instructed Defense Minister Andriy Taran to remove those responsible for organizing and conducting training flights during the investigation. According to the State Bureau of Investigation Main Investigation Department head Maksym Borchakovsky, the information about the plane's left engine failure is unreliable.–ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è –æ–± –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑–µ –ª–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ –¥–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è —Å–∞–º–æ–ª—ë—Ç–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–ø–µ–ª –∫—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–¥ –•–∞—Ä—å–∫–æ–≤–æ–º, –Ω–µ —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ - –ì–ë–†.

Some rules describe Fem Opp as a variant of R√∂dsk√§gg. It is an advanced and tactically demanding game and, of games played in Sweden, only Bridge and Poker are considered more difficult.R√∂dsk√§gg at hurspelarman.se. Retrieved 26 September 2020. It is an \\"enjoyable challenge\\" for those who want to develop as a card player.  History  Redbeard is a Swedish card game that was invented in the early 20th century and is mentioned in the literature as early as 1925. The name may have come from the notion that people with red beards were unreliable and although \\"no one believes in that legend anymore\\", the name has stuck.  Cards  The game is played with a standard 52-card pack minus the Jokers. In Sweden the 'Modern Swedish' pattern pack is commonly used.  Aim  Players start with 12 points each and the aim is to get down to zero by winning tricks while avoiding penalty points for failing to achieve a declared bid or failing to follow certain rituals. For each trick won, 1 point is deducted from a player's starting total of 12 points, but penalties of +5 or +6 points may be incurred during play.  Rules  The dealer shuffles and cuts before dealing six cards to each player in two rounds each of three cards.R√∂dsk√§gg at casinopro.se. Retrieved 26 September 2020. A players who has not been dealt any picture cards (A K Q J) may ask the dealer for a fresh hand of cards until he receives one with a picture card or is satisfied with his hand.R√∂dsk√§gg at kortspel.se. Retrieved 27 September 2020. There is then an auction in which players bid the number of tricks they think they can take, which can be from 0 to 5. In addition, there is the bid Redbeard, which is the highest and equates to a bid of 6 tricks. A player who bids Redbeard and takes all the tricks, automatically wins the whole game, but automatically loses and drops out of the game if he or she fails. The highest bidder is said to \\"have the game\\" and becomes the declarer.R√∂dsk√§gg at spelregler.org. Retrieved 27 September 2020. The declarer leads to the first trick. Thereafter the trick winner leads to the next trick. There are no trumps, but suit must be followed and the highest card of the led suit wins the trick. When there are only two tricks remaining, the declarer must ask everyone if they want to \\"play on\\" or fold. Players who have at least one trick must play on; players who have no tricks may fold with no penalty, discarding their hand, face down. If they play on, they score -2 for each trick taken, but incur +6 penalty points if they remain trick-less. If the declarer forgets to ask players if they want to play on, play continues as if everyone had taken at least one trick; tricks are still worth -1 point and there is no penalty for failing to take none, but the declarer may, in some rules, incur a penalty for his omission. Players must score exactly 0 points to win. If their score becomes negative, they must try to earn plus points to get back up to 0 points. They may do this by bidding a higher number of tricks than they expect to take. If two players reach 0 points during the same hand, they play a 'duel': a further hand between the two of them and the player winning the most tricks wins. Players must also notify the others when they are within 1 point of zero and when they reach zero. = Scoring = Players score -1 point for each trick they take. However, if the declarer (highest bidder) fails to take the exact number of tricks bid, +5 penalty points are incurred, although any tricks taken still score -1 point. So if the declarer had 7 points and bid 4 tricks but only took 3, the declarer's score goes up 5 points and down 3 giving a total of 9 points. A declarer who fails is said to \\"smoke\\". The game includes a number of formalities or rituals that it is important to follow. If they are forgotten, the opponents have the right to point this out by tapping or knocking on the table. The transgressor is then penalized +5 or +6 penalty points. Some rules refer to these additional rules as the variant of Fem Opp; others include them in the rules for R√∂dsk√§gg. The infractions that incur these penalty points vary, but may include: * If anyone other than the dealer cuts the pack, the dealer is penalised 5 points. * Picking up one's cards before the dealer has uttered the phrase \\"Knock for cards and infractions\\". 5 point penalty. * Forgetting to ask opponents if they want to continue playing with 2 tricks to go. 5 or 6 point penalty, as agreed. * Failing to notify the others when within 1 point of zero or on zero. 6 point penalty. The infractions must be picked up before the play starts or before the first card is led to the next trick as appropriate.

It runs from the tripoint with Russia in the north to the Black Sea coast in the south. Abkhazia, and those states that recognise its independence, view the border an international boundary separating two independent states, whereas the Georgian government and most other countries refers to it an 'Administrative Border Line' within Georgian territory. Description Bridge over the Enguri river border The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Russia on the Caucasus Mountains, and proceeds overland in a broadly south-westwards directions past peaks such as Mounts Kharikhra, Moguashirkha and Akiba. In the southern stretches it utilises the Enguri River, before terminating at the Black Sea coast just north of Anaklia. History During the 19th the Caucasus region was contested between the declining Ottoman Empire, Persia and Russia, which was expanding southwards. Russia formally annexed the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti in 1801, followed by the western Georgian Kingdom of Imereti (including modern Abkhazia) in 1804, following the Russian treaty with North Ossetia and the construction of Vladikavkaz as a base in 1784. Construction of the Georgian Military Road was begun in 1799, following the Treaty of Georgievsk. Over the course of the 1800s Russia continued to push its frontier southwards, at the expense of the Persian and Ottoman Empires. The Georgian territories were initially organised into the Georgia Governorate, then later split off as the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate from 1840-46, and finally divided into the governorates of Tiflis and Kutaisi. The northern border of these territories roughly corresponds with the modern Georgia-Russia border i.e. running along the Caucasus Mountain range. Abkhazia was formed as semi-autonomous region in 1810, with a border with Georgia set along the river Ghalizga. In 1864 Abkhazia was re-designated as the 'Sukhum Military District' (from 1883 Sukhum Okrug, within Kutaisi Governorate), incorporating the Samurzakano region west of the Ingur river which had hitherto been part of Kutais governorate and generally considered historical Georgian land. Over the following decades the ethnic makeup of Abkhazia changed due to influxes of Georgian and Russian settlers. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, the peoples of the southern Caucasus had seceded from Russia, declared the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR) in 1918 and started peace talks with the Ottomans. (Armenian Perspective) (Turkish Perspective) Meanwhile Sukhum Okrug had declared itself semi- autonomous on 9 November 1917 under the Abkhazian Peoples Council (APC). In early 1918 the APC met with Georgian leaders, and the two sides made an initial agreement that Abkhazia would constitute Sukhum okrug, including Samurzakano (despite its Mingrelian majority), and stretching along the Black Sea coast as far at the river Mzymta. The Bolsheviks invaded Abkhazia in April 1918 but were repulsed the following month. Meanwhile internal disagreements in the TDFR led to Georgia leaving the federation in May 1918, followed shortly thereafter by Armenia and Azerbaijan. Georgian and Abkhaz officials met in an attempt to hammer out a deal, with Georgia pushing to include Abkhazia within Georgia but as an autonomous region, however many Abkhaz leaders feared that Georgia aimed to 'Georgian-ise' the region and annex it outright. Russia recognised the independence of Georgia via the Treaty of Moscow (1920).Lang, DM (1962). A Modern History of Georgia, p. 226. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Meanwhile disputes between Abkhaz and Georgian officials continued, however these were rendered moot when in 1920 Russia's Red Army invaded Georgia in 1921. Abkhazia was designated as the Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia, on the proviso that it would later join the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic under a 'special union treaty'. Georgia was later incorporated along with Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Transcaucasian SFSR within the USSR. The Georgian SSR was reconstituted in 1936, incorporating Abkhazia as the (downgraded) Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.. Map showing the situation in Georgia at the end of 1993. Abkhaz forces were in control of all of the former Abkhaz ASSR, except the Kodori Gorge which remained in Georgian hands until the 2008 war with Russia. Tensions between Abkhazia and Georgia were already evident by the late 1970s, with both sides organising protests in 1978 alleging discrimination, prompting intervention by Moscow. Tensions simmered throughout the 1980s, though were stoked in latter part of the decade with the advent of perestroika and glasnost under Mikhail Gorbachev, with the Abkhaz pushing for full SSR status in 1988 and ethnic riots breaking out in Sukhumi in 1989.Transcaucasian Boundaries by John F. R. Wright, Suzanne Goldenberg, Richard Schofield. London, UCL Press, 1996. p. 202 Thereafter Abkhaz officials unilaterally declared the area an SSR. After Georgia declared independence in 1991 a compromise was brokered between Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia and the Abkhaz leadership, however Gamsakhurdia was removed in a coup in 1992 and replaced with a more hardline nationalist government under Eduard Shevardnadze. Abkhazia declared independence in August 1992 and war broke out with Georgia. After fierce fighting the Abkhaz forces pushed the Georgians out of most of Abkhazia (save for the Kodori Gorge) and a ceasefire was arranged in May 1994. Roughly 8,000 people on both sides had been killed many more made refugees, with most Georgians in Abkhazia either fleeing or being forced out of the area. Further clashes along the border occurred in 1998, 2001 and 2006, along with numerous other small skirmishes. Tensions increased following the election of Mikheil Saakashvili as Georgian President in 2004, with Saakashvili vowing to restore Georgian control over the breakaway regions of Abkhazia, Ajaria and South Ossetia. In 2008 Georgia attempted to wrest back South Ossetia, sparking a war with Russia. Abkhaz forces, backed by Russia, used the occasion to force Georgia out of the Kodori Gorge, thus gaining full control of all the territory of the former Abkhaz ASSR. Following the war Russia recognised the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The Abkhaz-Georgian border is currently guarded by the Russian and Abkhaz militaries and has been strengthened since the war, with barbed wire, control towers and other border control infrastructure being built.

One of these species was Coloborhynchus capito, which was originally named by Harry Seeley in 1870 as a species of Ornithocheirus. Its holotype is CAMSM B 54625, a snout. In 2001, this species was moved to Coloborhynchus by David Unwin, who also synonymized Ornithocheirus reedi (known from a lost specimen) with it. Rodrigues and Kellner recognized that the species was distinct from Coloborhynchus, but did not give it a new name pending the discovery of more complete material. N. fluviferox holotype snout In 2018, Jacobs et al. named a new species of Coloborhynchus, C. fluviferox from the Ifezouane Formation of the Kem Kem Group of Morocco based on a partial snout, and also tentatively referred another specimen from the same locality to a different, unnamed species. A 2020 review of a subfamily called Coloborhynchinae by Holgado and P√™gas moved both C. capito and C. fluviferox to a new genus, Nicorhynchus, and also associated the unnamed Ifezouane Formation coloborhynchine to N. fluviferox. The name Nicorhynchus is derived from the Old English nicor (knucker, a kind of water dragon) and the Ancient Greek rhynchos (\\"snout\\"), in reference to its likely ecology as a fish-eating, flying reptile found in river and marine deposits. Description Restoration of N. fluviferox The species N. capito represents the second largest known ornithocheirid (after a Tropeognathus specimen), and indeed the second largest toothed pterosaur known after Tropeognathus. A referred specimen from the Cambridge Greensand of England described in 2011 consists of a very large upper jaw tip which displays the tooth characteristics that distinguish N. capito from other species. The jaw tip is nearly tall and wide, with teeth up to in base diameter. If the proportions of this specimen were consistent with species of Coloborhynchus, the total skull length could have been up to , leading to an estimated wingspan of .

The site is a Special Protection Area, and with Dunragh Loughs a Special Area of Conservation. The protected area extends into County Fermanagh, with cross border cooperation in monitoring and surveying taking place there between the RSPB and BirdWatch Ireland. Pettigo Plateau is located to the west of Lough Derg. The reserve's habitats are blanket bog, lakes and wet heath, being one of the few intact bogs in County Donegal. Among the recorded flora on the reserve are cowberry, white sedge and a wide variety of bog moss species. Fauna include badgers, common frogs, common lizards, Irish hare and otters. Numerous birds live on the reserve such as merlin, hen harriers, peregrines and it is a breeding site for golden plovers. Greater white-fronted geese overwinter at the reserve. The highland blanket bogs of Pettigo Plateau are rare in Ireland, and span low hills and broad basins with a large quantity of acidic, nutrient-poor pools and lakes. The area is now uninhabited, but two cottages remain from the last families to live on what was part of the Leslie estate in the mid-1800s.

South Ossetia, and those states that recognise its independence, view the border as an international boundary separating two separate states, whereas the Georgian government does not recognise it even as an internal administrative boundary, with the area claimed by the South Ossetian Republic shared out amongst several Georgian Regions. Description The border starts in the west at the western tripoint with Russia on the Caucasus Mountains, just south of Mount Uilpata, and proceeds overland in a rough W-shaped arc, returning back to the Caucasus Mountains at the eastern Russian tripoint just north of Mount Zilga- Khokh. History The border at Khurvalleti During the 19th the Caucasus region was contested between the declining Ottoman Empire, Persia and Russia, which was expanding southwards. Russia formally annexed the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti in 1801 (including the area of modern South Ossetia), followed by the western Georgian Kingdom of Imereti in 1804, following the Russian treaty with North Ossetia and the construction of Vladikavkaz as a base in 1784. Construction of the Georgian Military Road was begun in 1799, following the Treaty of Georgievsk. Over the course of the 1800s Russia continued to push its frontier southwards, at the expense of the Persian and Ottoman Empires.The Georgian territories were initially organised into the Georgia Governorate, then later split off as the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate from 1840-46, and finally divided into the governorates of Tiflis and Kutaisi. Unlike Abkhazia, South Ossetia was never a territorial entity prior to the Soviet era, and it was subsumed into these various administrative divisions. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, the peoples of the southern Caucasus had seceded from Russia, declared the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR) in 1918 and started peace talks with the Ottomans. (Armenian Perspective) (Turkish Perspective) The area of modern South Ossetia was included within Georgia, though many Ossetians, who were generally poorer and typically rural tenants of Georgian landowners, were more sympathetic to the Bolshevik cause. A South Ossetian National Council (SONC) was formed and pushed for annexation by Russia or Ossetian autonomy. Rising tensions led to sporadic ethnic violence, culminating in a Georgian-Ossetian war in 1918-1920, resulting in thousands of deaths and a deepening of the ethnic divisions between Ossetians and Georgians.A Modern History of Georgia, pp. 228‚Äì9. Lang, David Marshall (1962). London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. \\"In the spring of the following year, the Caucasian Bureau of the All-Russian Communist Party formed a special South Ossetian Revolutionary Committee to lead an armed revolt against the Georgian government. A Russian-sponsored Ossetian force crossed the border from Vladikavkaz in June 1920 and attacked the Georgian Army and People's Guard. The Georgians reacted with vigour and defeated the insurgents and their supporters in a series of hard-fought battles. Five thousand people perished in the fighting and 20,000 Ossetians fled into Soviet Russia. The Georgian People's Guard displayed a frenzy of chauvinistic zeal during the mopping-up operations, many villages being burnt to the ground and large areas of fertile land ravaged and depopulated.\\" Internal disagreements led to Georgia leaving the federation in May 1918, followed shortly thereafter by Armenia and Azerbaijan. Russia recognised the independence of Georgia via the Treaty of Moscow (1920).Lang, DM (1962). A Modern History of Georgia, p. 226. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. However in 1921, with the support of many South Ossetians, the Red Army successfully invaded Georgia.A Modern History of Georgia, pp. 232‚Äì6. Lang, David Marshall (1962). London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. It was agreed that Georgia would consist of the former Governorates of Tiflis, Kutaisi and Batumi, plus Sukhum and Zakatal okrugs. Partly as a reward for their loyalty to the Soviet cause, the Ossetians in Georgia were to be granted an autonomous oblast. As no South Ossetian polity had hitherto existed a border would have be drawn from scratch, a difficult proposition given the mixed populations and difficult geography of the area. The Georgian and Ossetian revkoms were unable to come to an agreement on the matter, and it was thus referred to the Soviet's Kavbiuro in October 1921. The border thus drawn used existing administrative boundaries where possible (i.e. the uyezd and governorate boundaries) or geographic features such as mountain ranges, though ethnographic factors were the major determinant. Despite this several Georgian-inhabited villages and towns were included within South Ossetia, most notable Tskhinvali which was designated the South Ossetian capital despite Ossetians being a minority there, as it was the only sizable town in the region that could serve the purpose. Its inclusion required that several Georgian villages north of the town ipso facto became part of South Ossetia. On the other hand several Ossetian areas were also left on the 'wrong' side, notably the Kobi area astride the Georgian Military Highway. The creation of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast was officially proclaimed on 20 April 1922 as a semi-autonomous area within the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. Georgia was later incorporated along with Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Transcaucasian SFSR within the USSR. The Georgian SSR was reconstituted in 1936, incorporating the South Ossetian AO. Some South Ossetians remained unhappy at their subordination to Georgia, for example in 1925 there was a failed movement to merge with North Ossetia. As elsewhere with the Soviet Union the boundary making is often depicted as a cynical exercise in 'divide and rule', however Arsene Saparov, a scholar who had studied in detail the course of events that led to South Ossetia's creation, has stated that, \\"the autonomy of South Ossetia was, in the long run, an unsuccessful attempt at conflict resolution by the Bolsheviks, and not the product of deliberate manipulations by Stalin ‚Äì as is frequently believed. The boundaries of the autonomy were not drawn arbitrarily, but were the attempt to implement certain principles (ethnographic, political and ideological) on the ground.\\" Map showing the situation in Georgia at the end of 1993, with large parts of South Ossetia under separatist control. In the late 1980s with the advent of perestroika and glasnost under Mikhail Gorbechev tensions rose between the Ossetians and Georgians, with the Ossetians pushing for full ASSR status. As tensions rose there violent clashes between Georgians and Ossetians in Tshkhinvali in late 1989. In December 1990 Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia abolished South Ossetia‚Äôs autonomous status, sparking the 1991‚Äì1992 South Ossetia War. Meanwhile Georgia declared its independence in April 1991. After fierce fighting and some 1,000-2,000 deaths a ceasefire was signed in 1992, leaving the territory of the former South Ossetia AO divided between Ossetian and Georgian held areas. Tensions increased following the election of Mikheil Saakashvili as Georgian President in 2004, with Saakashvili vowing to restore Georgian control over the breakaway regions of Abkhazia, Ajaria and South Ossetia. In 2008 Georgia attempted to wrest back South Ossetia, sparking a war with Russia which ended with Georgia's defeat and the expansion of Ossetian control to the full territory of the former South Ossetia AO. Following the war Russia recognised the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Since 2009 Russian and Ossetian troops have begun unilaterally demarcating the Georgia-South Ossetia border on the ground with fences and signs, in a process known as 'borderization'. Georgia rejects the process as illegal, and is especially concerned as it claims that the border is being extended beyond the boundaries of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast and into Georgia 'proper'. The process has also been criticised as it has divided local people from their lands which fall on the 'wrong' side of the line, and the increased militarisation has impeded cross- border movement. Border crossings Sign and barbed wire fence along the border There are currently no legal border crossings, with South Ossetia only accessible from the north via Russia.

When completed, as expected in 2022, the power station will be the largest wind power station in Mauritania. Location The power station is located in the village of Boulenoir, also spelled Boulenouar, approximately , northwest of the city of Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. This is in the extreme northwest of the country, close to the international border with Western Sahara. Overview The wind farm consists of 39 Siemens-Gamesa turbines, each with rated capacity of 2.625 megawatts. The total installed capacity of the power station is 102.375 megawatts. Development The power station is owned by the consortium that is developing it and will operate it once construction is completed. The shareholders in the consortium are (a) the German conglomerate Siemens and (b) the Spanish wind turbine manufacturer Siemens Gamesa. The Spanish technology conglomerate Elecnor was part of the consortium but withdrew and sold its shareholding to Siemens, in the third quarter of 2020. Costs and funding As of September 2020, the development of this power station is budgeted at ‚Ç¨140 million. The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), a Kuwait-based development finance institution that is part of the Arab League, has committed to lend ‚Ç¨120 million towards the development of this power station. Impact As of 2020, Mauritania uses approximately 380 megawatts of electricity. Of this, approximately 76 percent (approx. 289 MW), is sourced from thermal generators. The remaining 24 percent (approx. 91 MW), is imported from Manantali Hydroelectric Power Station in Mali. With the country's population growling at 2.6 percent annually, renewable sources of energy, particularly solar and wind, offer an environmentally friendly pathway to expand its electricity supply and stimulate economic growth.

The event was held in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States. Excerpts from Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams aired on the syndicated television show ECW Hardcore TV, while the full event was released on VHS in 1995. It was made available for streaming on the WWE Network in 2020.  Event  The commentator for Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams was Joey Styles. The event was attended by approximately 1,150 people. The opening match pitted Tony Stetson - wrestling as \\"The Broad Street Bully\\" - against \\"The New Jersey Devil\\" (Doug Gentry) in a reference to the defeat of the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1995 Stanley Cup playoffs by eventual winners the New Jersey Devils several days prior. Wearing a Philadelphia Flyers hockey jersey, the Bully defeated the Devil by pinfall in 16 seconds with a flurry of punches. Following the match, the Devil attacked the Bully with a hockey stick until 911 came to the ring and repeatedly chokeslammed him. In the second match, Mikey Whipwreck defeated the much larger Val Puccio by pinfall after a series of low blows followed by a DDT. The third match saw the debuting Vampire Warrior defeat Hack Meyers by pinfall with a lifting DDT. Immediately following the third match, a brawl erupted between Vampire Warrior and Tommy Dreamer, with Vampire Warrior angry that his wife, Luna Vachon, was acting as Dreamer's valet. Dreamer won a bloody bout after DDT'ing Vampire Warrior onto a steel chair. New Jack, one-half of The Gangstas, made his ECW debut at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams. In the fifth match, 911 defeated the debuting \\"Jungle\\" Jim Steele in a squash that lasted less than one minute, pinning him following a chokeslam. Following the match, 911 gave Steele several more chokeslams. The sixth match saw Beulah McGillicutty face Luna Vachon in an extension of the feud between Raven and Tommy Dreamer. In her first match for ECW, the diminutive McGillicutty pinned Vachon in a matter of seconds after Raven's henchman Stevie Richards hit her with a steel chair immediately following the bell. Following the match, Raven and Richards attacked Vachon. When Dreamer - injured from his impromptu match with Vampire Warrior - intervened, Raven gave him a chair shot and a DDT and then broke his fingers. Raven then handcuffed Vachon and prepared to hit her with a steel chair, but Dreamer threw himself in front of her and absorbed the blow. Cactus Jack challenged for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams. A scheduled six-man tag team match pitting Dreamer, 2 Cold Scorpio and Taz against The Pitbulls and Raven was changed to a handicap match due to Dreamer being incapacitated following the chair shot from Raven. Hack Myers attempted to substitute for Dreamer but this was disallowed by referee Bill Alfonso, who would draw the ire of the ECW audience by rigidly enforcing rules. During the match, Francine debuted as a member of the audience besotted with Stevie Richards who had accompanied Raven to ringside; Richards' flirting led to an argument between Francine and Beulah, prompting Raven to lead Richards and Beulah backstage, leaving The Pitbulls two-on-two with 2 Cold Scorpio and Taz. The match ended when Taz delivered a super belly-to-belly suplex to Pitbull #2 and pinned him. The penultimate match was scheduled to be The Public Enemy defending the ECW World Tag Team Championship against Axl Rotten and a tag team partner of Rotten's choosing. Rotten introduced his brother, Ian Rotten, as his partner but his selection was disallowed by referee Bill Alfonso due to The Bad Breed having lost a match in November 1994 with the stipulation that they could not longer team together if they lost. The Rotten brothers subsequently brawled with one another. With no opponents, The Public Enemy danced in the ring until The Gangstas made their debut, attacking The Public Enemy until being arrested. The main event saw The Sandman defend his ECW World Heavyweight Championship against Cactus Jack in a barbed wire match. During the bout, Cactus Jack seemingly defeated The Sandman by technical knockout, but in a \\"Dusty finish\\", referee Bill Alfonso ordered the match to continue, ruling that the Championship could not change hands on a 10 count. The match ended when The Sandman choked Cactus Jack with a length of barbed wire and Alfonso declared that Cactus Jack could no longer continue, awarding the bout to The Sandman. Following the match, ECW commissioner Tod Gordon attempted to attack Alfonso, but was clotheslined down. The event ended with Cactus Jack - wrapped in barbed wire - leaving the ring to a standing ovation.

She became a professor at Duke University School of Medicine and known internationally for her work in pediatric HIV prevention. After 1993, using zidovudine during pregnancy led to an estimated reduction of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV in the United States by 75 percent and a 47 percent decrease in new HIV infections globally. Early life and education Catherine Wilfert was born in Inglewood, California. She studied at Stanford University. She recalled that one of her professors told her not to bother applying to Harvard Medical School. In 1958, she graduated from Harvard Medical School as one of only five women in her class. She did her pediatric residency at Boston City Hospital, in the early 1960s and interned under John Enders. whom she called her \\"most influential teacher\\". Career In 1969, Wilfert became a pediatric faculty member at the Duke University School of Medicine. Her research was in virology and epidemiology of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. In 1976, she became the division chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases. Years into the AIDS epidemic there had not been any medication to treat HIV infection, but when zidovudine was approved, \\"Wilfert theorized that by reducing the viral load of infected mothers, she could diminish the amount of virus their babies were exposed to, thereby reducing HIV transmission from mother to baby.\\" In April 1991 the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) of the US NIAID and the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) and the National Agency of Research on AIDS (ANRS), France started the clinical trial of zidovudine (AZT) in HIV-infected pregnant women otherwise known as \\"ACTG protocol 076\\". The trial showed such a big reduction in the risk for HIV transmission to infants, that it was halted prematurely in 1993 and later became the new standard of care, leading to an estimated reduction of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV in the United States by 75 percent. In 1996, she retired from Duke University and became scientific director of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in low-income countries Thailand, South Africa, Kenya, Cameroon, and Uganda. The \\"Call To Action\\" led to a 47 percent decrease in new HIV infections globally. She retired from this position in 2010. Personal life In 1971 Wilfert married Samuel Katz (pediatrician).

The shikla was primarily worn during the Almohad Caliphate between the end of the 12th-century and the middle of the 19th-century.  Etymology  The word comes from the Jewish surname Bou Shikla, which signifies ..  History  With the arrival of the Banu Hilal to Kairouan in the 12th century, the Jewish community in the area began to face discrimination and intolerance from their new rulers. While Jews and Christians benefited from increased rights under the Fatimids, the same rights were not provided under the Banu Hilal. The new rulers argued that while the hadith in which the prophet Muhammad allowed freedom of religion for People of the Book (ahl al-kit√¢b); the rule was only in place for a period of 500 years after the Hegira, which coincided with the year 1107, the date when the Jews of Medina told Muhammad that the Messiah would arrive. The date had long since passed when the Almohad Caliphate settled in Ifriqiya, allowing the new rulers to say there was no longer a reason to keep those privileges for dhimmis. Among the numerous obligations that Jews suffered with was the obligation fo wearing a Shikla, on the order of Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur in 1198., in order to be able to distinguish them from Muslim citizens and forbid them from certain places, occupations and events. Even Jews who converted to Islam were forced to wear the distinctive headpiece. The Jews continued to wear the Shikla in Tunisia until the creation of the Pacte fondamental (which removed dhimmi status) following the decree of Mohammed Bey on September 14, 1858. The pact not only abolished the clothing but allowed Jews to wear the Red Ch√©chia headpiece like the rest of Tunisians. Ibn Abi Dhiaf wrote about the decision:.  Description  The requirements for the shikla varied with the different dynasties that ruled over Tunisia. The main goal was simply to distinguish and humiliate Jews in public spaces. Under the reign of the Almohad Caliphate, it was principally a turban dyed yellow at the end. Jewish converts to Islam were forced to wear a long dark blue tunic with sleeves so large they reached ones' feet, and a Skullcap in place of a turban.. During the Ottoman rule of Tunisia, the Twansa Jewish community put on black bonnets while the Granas preferred more European headgear to avoid being confused with the indigenous Twansa.

From 1884 to 1897 he was Vicar Apostolic and Bishop of Cooktown in Queensland, Australia.  Early life  Hutchinson was born on 2 January 1837 in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of James Hutchinson and Mary (n√©e Cummings).  Religion life  Hutchison entered the Augustinian Order in 1861 and was ordained a priest on 30 October 1865. Father Hutchinson served for some years in the Augustinian Mission of St Monica, in Hoxton in the East End of London. In 1872 he was appointed first Prior of the newly appointed Novitiate and Home of Studies, St. Augustine's, Rathfarmham, near Dublin. At the provincial chapter of his order held in Dublin in 1883, Father Hutchinson was unanimously elected Prior-Provincial of the Irish Augustinian Province. In January 1884, he was appointed by Papal brief as Vicar-Apostolic of the Vicariate of Cooktown in Cooktown, Far North Queensland, Australia. Hutchison left immediately for Cooktown accompanied by Fathers O'Byrne and Murrayn. In 1885 he assisted at the Plenary Council of the Australia Bishops held in Sydney. In 1887 the role of Vicar Apostolic of Cooktown was raised by the Pope to the status of a Bishop. On 28 August 1887 Hutchinson was consecrated as Bishop by Cardinal Patrick Moran in St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. The success of the Vicariate of Cooktown demonstrated his zeal and administrative ability. In 1888 he invited the Sisters of Mercy to establish a community in Cooktown where a new convent was erected at a cost of ¬£65,000. Under Hutchinson, many new churches were established.  Later life  In February 1897 Hutchison contracted dengue fever and never fully recovered. In June 1897 he undertook a journey travelling with the Redemptorist Fathers' Mission, which caused the \\"utter collapse\\" of his health. Hutchinson died in Cooktown on 28 October 1897.

Her research considers health inequity and the social determinants of health.  Early life and education  Alang is from Cameroon. Her mother, Margaret M. Tanni, raised her and encouraged her to pursue an academic career. Alang earned her first degree in Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Buea. She moved to the United States as a graduate student, where she studied sociology at Lehigh University under an F visa. After earning her master's degree, Alang moved to the University of Minnesota, where she studied the mental health of African- Americans under the supervision of Donna McAlpine. She completed her doctoral research in a predominantly Black neighbourhood, where she first witnessed the impact of police violence. After earning her doctorate, Alang was made an analyst in the Hennepin County Public Health department.  Research and career  Alang joined the faculty at Lehigh University in 2015, where she investigates structural racism in the healthcare system and how this impacts the delivery and outcome of health services. In 2019 she was named a Campus Compact Engaged Scholar. Alang worked with Rachel Hardeman to investigate the health impacts of police brutality and how it impacts trust in medical institutions. Together they found that people who had experienced negative encounters with the police had higher levels of mistrust in the medical system. In an interview with Inverse, Alang remarked ‚ÄúWhen people mistrust the healthcare system, they don‚Äôt want to use the healthcare system. They don‚Äôt want to engage in care. That‚Äôs a big problem, and police brutality increases that,‚Äù. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic Alang investigated the disproportionate impact of coronavirus disease on communities of colour. After the killing of George Floyd, Alang provided expert commentary to the media on the public health impact of police brutality. She wrote about the role of white communities in confronting structural racism, in speaking up, calling out discrimination and taking action to stand up for racial justice. Beyond societal racism, Alang has investigated racism in higher education. In September 2020, Alang tweeted to call for teachers to become more aware of their language and sensitive to the fact that children could be living in single parent homes, or ones with two mothers or two fathers. The tweet went viral, and was covered across international media.

Only two were built. Design and development The H.20 Pirate was Argonaut aircraft's first product, flying in 1935. Its wire-braced high wing was rectangular in plan out to blunted tips. It had solid spruce spars and wooden ribs and was fabric-covered apart from plywood-covered leading edges. Its ailerons were relatively short but broad. The hull was also wooden, a semi-monocoque structure with ply planking, ply frames and spruce stringers. It had a single step planing bottom. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side in an enclosed cabin forward of the wing leading edge. The third seat was just behind them on the centreline and was more like a jump-seat than a true passenger seat. The H.20 Pirate's inverted, air- cooled, Menasco C-4 was mounted close to the top of the fuselage above the wing, its four-bladed propeller just clearing the central wing trailing edge. The steel tube engine mounting ran down through the fuselage to the main landing gear mountings. The vertical tail was rather straight-edged in profile, with its tailplane mounted about halfway up carrying lobate plan elevators. The Pirate was stabilized on water with a pair of rather bulky, flat-bottomed, strut-mounted floats at about two-thirds span. Its retractable landing gear was narrow track, with wheels on short, rubber ring-damped legs that were manually retracted into a horizontal position with a wheel in the cabin. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel swivelled for ground manoeuvrability. H.20 Pirate The Pirate prototype H.20 first flew in 1934. Its development programme was successfully concluded in late 1935; by then it was described more realistically as a two place aircraft. This programme led to a second aircraft, the H.24, intended as the production prototype. Its span was increased to and the Menasco was strut-mounted well above the fuselage, in clearer air, allowing a diameter, two-bladed propeller to be fitted. Long, V-form struts from the top of the engine mounting to the spars replaced the earlier wire bracing. More refined, V-bottom, floats were used. Its tail was revised with more rounded fixed surfaces and a deeper and more rounded rudder and the elevators had more area with only a small cut-out for rudder movement. These and other production aircraft related changes increased the empty weight of the H.24 by 45%. By 1937 it was once again described as a three-seater, though little is known about the cabin and there was no glazing aft of the cockpit.It was on display at the at the National Aviation Show held in New York from 28 January 1937 but no production followed. Development continued after Argonauts acquisition by the (Donald G) White Aircraft Co. in 1938, as the White A-R 3-seat amphibian and the White Gull 4-seat amphibian. Only a single White A-R was registered as NX77Y and further work was halted due to lack of market.

She was an early source of songs for the folk song collector Cecil Sharp and she is said to have shaped his interests. Her half- sister was another singer named Louie Hooper (born Louisa England). Life White was born in Puckington in Somerset in 1848. Her mother was Sarah Bridge who taught her many songs. When she was about thirteen her mother married William England in 1855. She grew up in a family of six children including her half-sister Louie was born in 1860. She sometimes used the name Lucy England. Louie was unable to walk but they both worked with others involved in glove and shirt-making. White was working on collars at the age of ten. She married Jonathon White in 1875 and Louie married George Hooper in 1884. Between 1875 and 1884 she had eight children although two were illegitimate. Louie had three children after her marriage to George Hooper even though he had died soon after they married. In the 1890s Louie and Lucy were living next door to each other in Westport. She came to notice because Charles Marson came as the vicar to her village. He was a socialist, an enthusiast for his parishioners and a bane to the church authorities. His friend Cecil Sharp was a music teacher as he was Principal of the Hampstead Conservatoire of Music. In 1903 Sharp came to visit Marson in Somerset and Sharp started to collect songs. Other local singers like Emma Overd came to the notice of Sharp in 1904. Sharp's income was derived after 1905 largely from lecturing and publishing folk music. \\"Sweet Kitty\\" transcribed from Lucy White by Cecil Sharp in 1906 Sharp's books began to be published in 1905 and it included 19 of the songs that Lucy and Louie had taught him and one of the tunes. They had sang 33 tunes to Sharp including 27 sung just by Hooper. Sharp had visited them over twenty times. They were both credited in Sharp's books. After they were published Sharp gave a copy of the books to them with the dedication that \\"exchange is no robbery\\". Their songs Seventeen Come Sunday, Henry Martin, Sweet Kitty and The Sign of the Bonny Blue Bell were among those chosen as \\"Folk Songs from Somerset\\".
